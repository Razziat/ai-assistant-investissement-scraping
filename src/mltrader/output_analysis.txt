Based on the historical financial data and sentiment analysis provided in the CSV files, my analysis reveals that all three companies have potential as investment opportunities. However, there are some key differences between them that make Airbus SE and Thales more attractive investments at this time.

Airbus SE has consistently outperformed both Thales and Lvmh in terms of stock price growth, with an average monthly percent change of 1.95% compared to 1.28% for Thales and 1.71% for Lvmh. Additionally, Airbus SE has a higher maximum price of 172.77999877929688, indicating potential for further growth.

On the other hand, Thales has a lower average PE ratio of 34.98, which suggests that the company may be undervalued compared to its peers. While the sentiment analysis indicates a slightly more negative sentiment towards Thales than Airbus SE and Lvmh, the confidence score is higher for Thales at 0.96, indicating greater investor confidence in the company's future performance.

Lvmh, on the other hand, has a lower average PE ratio of 25.77, which may indicate that the company is overvalued compared to its peers. The sentiment analysis also indicates a slightly more positive sentiment towards Lvmh than Airbus SE and Thales, but the confidence score is lower at 0.98, indicating less investor confidence in the company's future performance.

Based on these findings, I would recommend investing in Airbus SE and Thales over Lvmh. Both companies have shown strong growth potential and are undervalued compared to their peers. However, it is important to note that past performance does not guarantee future results, and investors should always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.

In conclusion, my analysis suggests that Airbus SE and Thales have the most promising investment potential based on historical financial data and sentiment analysis. While Lvmh may also be a viable investment opportunity, investors should exercise caution and conduct additional research before making a decision.
