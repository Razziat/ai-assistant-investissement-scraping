Bagram Airmen respond to aircraft emergency > Air Force > Article Display - Air Force Link,"Mon, 08 Mar 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmLm1pbC9OZXdzL0FydGljbGUtRGlzcGxheS9BcnRpY2xlLzExNzQwMy9iYWdyYW0tYWlybWVuLXJlc3BvbmQtdG8tYWlyY3JhZnQtZW1lcmdlbmN5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bagram Airmen respond to aircraft emergency

Airmen assigned to the 455th Expeditionary Maintenance Group here were some of the first responders on the scene after an Airbus A300 crew performed an emergency landing March 1 here.



The aircraft, contracted to DHL International, was carrying mail and cargo when an unsafe gear indicator alerted the crew to a problem.



The crew touched down after a visual inspection by tower members to ensure the landing gear was extended. Upon landing, the main landing gear collapsed and the aircraft slid to a stop between the runway and a taxi area.



""We were actually accomplishing some work on the flightline when the incident occurred,"" said Tech. Sgt. Alexander Figliola, a 455th EMXG crash and recovery technician. ""A call came over the radio for an in-flight emergency notification system for all emergency responders to come to the flightline.""



Sergeant Figliola, deployed from Royal Air Force Lakenheath, England, said as the aircraft touched down it appeared to be all right, but as it settled on the ground and slowed its airspeed, the left side landing gear collapsed and the aircraft began to slide down the runway. He said it finally came to a stop between the runway and a taxiway.



""We were cleared on the runway so we all rushed to the scene not really knowing what to expect,"" Sergeant Figliola said. ""When we arrived at the aircraft, people were sliding down the emergency slide and the fire department was putting out a small fire around the engine. We were relieved because the situation could have been much worse.""



Once the scene had calmed, Sergeant Figliola's team began to assess damage to the aircraft and airfield. They also discussed how to move the large aircraft and restore air traffic to the flight line.



""As soon as we saw that everyone was all right, we automatically started discussing the location and what we were going to need to get the aircraft out of the way,"" he added. ""We knew that we had a lot of prep work ahead of us. We began to coordinate with other units on base to get the heavy equipment and supplies needed to get it out of the way.""



Sergeant Figliola explained the primary mission of crash and recovery is to respond to incidents of this nature and assess damage to aircraft. They also remove damaged aircraft.



This particular incident provided unique challenges because although the team is trained on all air frames, their primary mission had been fighter aircraft. They needed to make adjustments to compensate for the size, weight and location of the aircraft, and the weather.



""Weather was one of the key factors to how we were going to move the plane,"" said Sergeant Figliola, a native of Beverly Hills, Fla. ""It was raining and the ground was pretty soft, that along with the weight of the aircraft that was still loaded with cargo and fuel made it pretty messy.""



The crash and recovery team, with help from the 455th Expeditionary Civil Engineer Squadron, the U.S. Army and members of other 455th EMXG flights used a 120-ton, civilian-contracted crane to raise the left wing of the aircraft, he explained.



Sergeant Figliola said once the left wing was raised, a 40-foot flatbed trailer substituted as the left side landing gear and a heavy expanded mobile tactical truck, normally used to tow up armored vehicles and heavy equipment, pulled the aircraft approximately 100 feet to a taxiway parallel to the active runway.



""Our crash and recovery team responds to all in-flight emergencies to ensure the safety of the aircrew and the aircraft while also ensuring runway operability,"" said Lt. Col. Jacqueline Mongeon, the455th EMXG deputy commander.



Colonel Mongeon, deployed from Minot Air Force Base, N.D., said the crash and recovery team responds to any aircraft incident in a six country region and is trained to handle any airframe. They constantly perform periodic preventive maintenance on their equipment and accomplish training to ensure they are prepared for incidents like this; although, they would prefer there not be a need.



""It was truly a joint effort,"" she added. ""Our team performed superbly. After their initial assessment of the incident they developed a plan to ensure the safety of the ground personnel, lift and move the aircraft and re-open the runway to large frame aircraft as expeditiously as possible. They were able to accomplish all of this within 24 hours of being tasked.""



""I can't say enough about the crew that I worked with,"" Sergeant Figliola said. ""None of us had a great deal of hands-on experience with such a large airframe, but we all worked together to accomplish the mission and get the runway operational as safely and efficiently as possible.""

Airbus gets a crafty upgrade by flying the flag for biodiversity - The Guardian,"Thu, 18 Mar 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC8yMDEwL21hci8xOC91bi15ZWFyLW9mLWJpb2RpdmVyc2l0eS1haXJidXPSAVJodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vZW52aXJvbm1lbnQvMjAxMC9tYXIvMTgvdW4teWVhci1vZi1iaW9kaXZlcnNpdHktYWlyYnVz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Who do you think might just have been granted the right to display the official logo of the United Nations International Year of Biodiversity? A conservation body, perhaps. Or a new brand of organic food?

Well, no. It's an aircraft manufacturer, actually. The world's largest aircraft manufacturer: Airbus Industries. The European company that is doing more than anyone else, Boeing included, to increase the number of flights we take, and thus the airline industry's contribution to climate change.

During 2010, the logo will appear on the side of Airbus's latest airliner, the A380, on scheduled services with the world's airlines. The largest passenger aircraft is specially designed for those long-haul flights across oceans and from Europe to the far east, where a single flight can more than double your annual CO2 emissions.

Airbus has won this green accolade by dint of hard cash. Airbus is helping fund a cherished project of the secretariat of the UN Convention on Biodiversity to educate young people across the world about the virtues of biodiversity, called the Green Wave Initiative. Airbus did not respond to questions from the Guardian about how much money is involved in the partnership, but the UN Environment Programme has described it as a ""huge gesture of support"".

The Green Wave is a neat idea. To mark the International Day of Biodiversity on 22 May, young people will be asked to plant a tree at 10am local time wherever they are in the world. Thus they will create a ""green wave"" that will spread from east to west round the planet.

But it is an even neater idea for Airbus, the current trailblazer for an industry whose year-on-year carbon dioxide emissions are rising faster than any other. At a time when climate change is widely recognised by ecologists as a leading cause of species loss around the world, Airbus's adoption of a green mantle courtesy of a major UN conservation organisation might seem, well, ironic.

Airbus has increased its cuddlability quotient by partnering with National Geographic on the green wave project. National Geographic is an organisation with a sky-high green image. The duo got a special thank you from UN secretary-general Ban ki-Moon when they announceed the partnership last June.

Airbus has an answer to those who accuse it of greenwash. The company says that it is ""pioneering greener flight"". And it is undoubtedly true that the Airbus A380 superjumbo has got its emissions down, thanks to lighter materials and smarter flying technology.

Airbus says it will reduce emissions to less than 75 grams of CO2 for every passenger kilometre. But that will not apply if its wide open spaces are filled with extra business and first-class seats as many purchasing airlines promise. Look out for Singapore Airline's super-first class on the A380, with private suites, double beds and wardrobes and wide-screen TVs.

But even if Airbus achieves those low figures per passenger-kilometre in real operation, the big problem is that passenger-kilometres are going up far faster than aircraft efficiency is improving.

Emissions from the airline industry continue to rise by about 3% a year, taking up an ever greater share of total global man-made emissions. So a little humility might be in order from the world's most prolific manufacturer of new planes. But, no.

Announcing the adoption of the logo this month, Airbus's senior vice-president for public affairs and communications, Rainer Ohler baldly claimed that the aviation industry had ""already reduced aircraft emissions by 70% in the last 40 years.""

You don't need to be a statistician to spot the trick here. Not so much ""hide the decline"" as ""hide the increase"". Ohler meant airlines had cut emissions per passenger-kilometre by 70% since the days before jumbo jets. But, to be clear, aircraft emissions are soaring. In Britain, for instance, they have risen since 1970 by between four- and five-fold.

They will continue to soar, while the likes of Airbus continues to fill the skies with chunks of flying metal the size of a football pitch. And whatever logo they put on the side of their planes, species will continue to go extinct as a result."
Buyers of Airbus Transport Plane Accept Price Increase - The New York Times,"Fri, 05 Mar 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTAvMDMvMDYvYnVzaW5lc3MvZ2xvYmFsLzA2YWlyYnVzLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — European Aeronautic Defense and Space, the parent company of Airbus, said Friday that buyers of its A400M military transport plane had agreed to a 10 percent price increase, a measure that will help cover substantial cost overruns and allow the troubled project to continue.

The company said the seven European governments that signed on as customers for the A400M announced in Berlin that they had agreed to the increase for the 180 planes on order. They will also provide 1.5 billion euros ($2 billion) in loans in exchange for a share of the revenue from future exports.

“EADS considers this a sound basis for a successful evolution of the A400M program,” the company said.

EADS said it would also absorb some of the cost overruns by taking a write-off of 1.8 billion euros ($2.5 billion) for the project, a provision that would cause it to post a loss for 2009. The A400M project is nearly four years behind schedule and more than 7 billion euros over budget, and the plane itself is several tons overweight. EADS has already written off 2.4 billion euros in costs. The project was expending cash at a rate of about 100 million euros a month."
Airbus A350 versus Boeing 787: differences and many similarities - ZDNet,"Mon, 01 Mar 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXZlcnN1cy1ib2VpbmctNzg3LWRpZmZlcmVuY2VzLWFuZC1tYW55LXNpbWlsYXJpdGllcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If you removed its name in the spec sheet, Airbus' forthcoming A350 XWB (eXtra Wide Body) passenger jet could easily be confused with its primary rival, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. It will take a while before you can easily distinguish one from the other once they are both regularly in the air.

The A350 will be made from 53 per cent carbon fiber; the 787 is 50 per cent carbon fiber. Both are long range and can fly in excess of 8,000 miles without refueling. Somewhat bigger, the A350 will have 270-440 seats to the 787's is 210-330. Both come in three models although the smallest 787 may be dropped.

A350 or Boeing 787? (answer: A350). credit: Airbus

The A350 promises 25 per cent fuel consumption improvement from its ""current long range nearest competitor (it's unclear what plane Airbus is comparing the A350 to on fuel efficiency, but offers it as a replacement for ""any [Boeing] 747 operator""); the 787 claims to deliver 15 per cent better fuel efficiency over the similarly-sized (and aged) Boeing 767.

The 787 has 876 orders from 53 customers while the A350 has 505 from 32 customers (about what the 787 had at the same stage in its development). The A350 windows are wider; the 787's are taller.

It goes on and on like that. For the flyer, you say ToeMAYto, I say ToeMAHto.

Of course, there are major differences.

One area in the A350 that will distinguish it from other passengers jetliners, though, will be the cockpit which will have six ""very large LCD displays"" comprising the flight information center instead of the 10 found in the A380 super jumbojet (much of the technology in the A350 was hatched in the A380). Solid state electronics in the cockpit also reduce the need for the hundreds of individual circuit breakers typically found in jetliners.

Another difference is that the A350 is still on paper. The first one won't roll off the line in Airbus' new Toulouse, France final assembly plant until 2011. Airbus expects to enter the A350 into service in 2013, but if its experience is anything like Boeing's with the 787, add two years to that timetable. Some aviation bloggers say there's hints the schedule is already slipping.

With any luck, Boeing will ship the first 787 to customers in the fourth quarter of this year.

Given the scale of investment, the effort to design jetliners and competiton in the same markets, it stands to reason they are similar in both size and technology. But it doesn't always work that way: Airbus developed the huge and less successful A380 while Boeing concentrated on the more modest 787.

Another major difference is that the biggest model, the A350 1000, will carry up to 100 passengers more than the biggest 787. Boeing's answer to that is the 747-8 Intercontinental, a new model of the world's first jumbojet.

The A350 will be a lot more expensive than the 787. It lists for $225-$285 million; At $150-$205 million, the 787 is a relative bargain. Those prices are usually discounted, but the starting point for the conversation would clearly seem to favor Boeing unless the A350 turns out to be that much better.

Buying something as sophisticated as jetliners, however, isn't just a head-on comparison of price performance. Years of dealmaking includes courtships, politics and occasionally, bribes. Time and sales wise, though, the A350 has to climb much higher to reach cruising altitude than the 787 at this point.

One area where I think Airbus is considerably ahead of Boeing is its web site. Airbus.com is more easier searched and much more visually pleasing. But can that translate into an edge in airplane performance..and sales?

"After tanker flop, Airbus pushes transport plane in U.S. - Colorado Springs Gazette","Mon, 15 Mar 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL2dhemV0dGUuY29tL25ld3MvYWZ0ZXItdGFua2VyLWZsb3AtYWlyYnVzLXB1c2hlcy10cmFuc3BvcnQtcGxhbmUtaW4tdS1zL2FydGljbGVfNjgwYWRhM2QtMGI2NS01MjkwLWFiYzgtZTBjNjY2Y2RlMTY3Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Unbowed in its push into the lucrative U.S. defense market, Airbus said Monday it is aiming to sell about 210 of its much delayed A400M military airlifters to the United States.

The comments from Domingo Urena, chief of Airbus Military, come as parent company EADS still smarts from a move last week by U.S. partner Northrop Grumman Corp. to pull out of their combined bid for a massive $35 billion contract to build refueling tankers for the U.S. Air Force.

Northrop explained it didn't think it could win, and EADS said it couldn't bid alone. The move has all but ensured Airbus' U.S. rival Boeing of victory — and prompted protests by French and EU leaders of alleged American protectionism.

Speaking to reporters Monday in Paris, Urena focused on the A400M and said Airbus Military hopes to sell 500 of the planes to countries not in the original program over the next three decades — including 210 in the United States.

Marketing promotion for the A400M will rev up in the second half of this year, Urena said, and ""for us, the United States is a key country.""

""It's out of the question that we don't go over to compete in the United States, insofar as the Americans give us the opportunity to do it,"" he said.

Urena said it's too early to tell whether he would seek a partner to help sell the transporter in the United States, but would not rule out the option.

""It is clear that in the American market, if we have an American partner, in effect that gives us an opening,"" he said.

Urena hinted that Airbus could seek to ally with Northrop on the A400M: ""Northrop Grumman is among the companies of reference in defense in the United States — but it's not the only one.""

The ambition for U.S. sales for the A400M shows Airbus will press on in the U.S. despite homegrown competition for military airlifters, notably from Lockheed Martin's C-130 and Boeing's C-17.

Featured Local Savings

Urena declined to provide an export catalog price for the A400M but said it would be ""competitive.""

Seven original customer nations for the A400M — Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey — have ordered a total of 180 planes. Malaysia has another four on order.

Urena said France, Britain and Germany — which has the largest single order, for 60 planes — will receive the A400Ms first as they roll off the production line.

Airbus expects to start delivering the A400Ms sometime after December 2012 — or three years after its first flight, which was on Dec. 11. Four are expected to be completed this year.

The plane got a lifeline on March 5, when EADS and the seven customer states reached a new financing accord to pay for more than euro5.2 billion in cost overruns.

The A400M is four years behind schedule in part because of technical glitches last year. It still faces ""challenges"" on issues including its propulsion systems, Urena said.

As for the refueling tanker, Urena estimated the potential market outside the United States was for 250 planes — ""and we're going to continue to fight"" to win market share elsewhere.

EADS North America and Northrop had done ""intense"" work to win the tanker, but ""there are things we could have done better,"" Urena said without elaborating.

The European Union has noted a trade imbalance between the United States and the 27-nation bloc on defense equipment. In 2008, the U.S. exported $5 billion worth of defense materials while importing only $2.2 billion from the European side, it said."

The increase will come into effect from December this year. Production of its long-haul A330/340 family will be kept at eight airframes per month.

Airbus is aiming to keep its deliveries for 2010 around the same level as last year, when it delivered 498 aircraft including 402 A320-family jets.

By the end of February, the manufacturer's 2010 deliveries totalled 67 aircraft including 56 from its single-aisle range. Its A320 backlog comprised 2,358 aircraft.

""Thanks to our pro-active order book management we have been able to keep production stable during the year of the downturn, but now it is definitely time to think ahead,"" says Airbus executive vice-president, programmes, Tom Williams.

Airbus' production rate on the A320 stood at 36 aircraft a year ago, when it stated that it would reduce the rate to 34 from October 2009.

Parent company EADS expects gross orders for the airframer to reach 250-300 aircraft this year.

State fund for homegrown jumbo jet urged By Xin Dingding (China Daily)

Updated: 2010-03-27 07:53

Beijing - The chief designer of the country's first C919 jumbo jet has urged authorities to establish a multi-billion-yuan State fund to help boost the sales of homegrown airplanes.

More financial support from the government will bolster the domestic aviation industry, which is facing strong competition from foreign players such as Boeing and Airbus, said Wu Guanghui, vice-president of the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China Ltd (COMAC).

China is forecast to need about 4,000 planes in the next 20 years.

Major domestic airlines such as Air China, China Eastern and China Southern, as well as Sichuan Airlines and Hainan Airlines, have expressed strong interest and support in buying his company's jumbo jet, Wu said.

The letter ""C"" in the title of the country's first homegrown jumbo jet is said to stand for ""China"" as well as ""COMAC"", while the first ""9"" implies ""forever"" in Chinese culture and the ""19"" stands for the jet's maximum 190 seats.

The single-aisle jetliner is designed for short- to medium-haul flights of up to 5,555 km.

The draft design of the country's first independently developed jumbo jet will be completed by this year and be put into production by next year, Wu had said earlier.

The plane is slated to test fly in 2014 and be ready for deliveries after 2016. COMAC, which was founded in 2008 to take charge of the country's jumbo jet project, expects to sell 2,000 C919 planes at home and abroad in the next two decades, Wu said.

""But what could harm the sales of the domestically made planes is that very few aircraft-leasing companies buy domestic airplanes and rent them to airlines,"" he said in an interview with China Daily.

""Leasing is the major way for airlines to expand the fleet ... and the situation will especially hinder small airlines, which are short of funds, from buying the cheaper homemade jets.""

Wu suggested that the government establish a State fund of at least 30 billion yuan to help homegrown jet buyers with their financing.

The government should also give interest subsidies or exemptions through policy banks to firms and airlines that lease or use homegrown planes and airlines. Firms and airlines from both home and abroad could enjoy the policy, he said.

Currently, the government gives interest subsidies to MA60, a 50-seat turboprop manufactured by the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC). By last year, AVIC had acquired 186 orders for the planes and delivered 29 of them to users from home and abroad.

The government should extend and strengthen subsidies in the next five years for the use, lease and export of all homegrown planes, which include the C919 and another self-developed regional plane, the ARJ21, which has 70 to 90 seats and is slated to be delivered this year, Wu said.

""A team including COMAC and relative government departments is now studying the issue,"" he said.

Among the 1,000-strong fleet of planes now flying commercial routes in China, only four are homemade MA60 regional planes. Most are Boeing and Airbus aircraft.

As so few of the homegrown aircraft are used, it will take a long time for domestically developed commercial planes to form an effective brand, said Sun Cong, deputy chief engineer with AVIC.

""In a market dominated by companies like Boeing, Airbus and Bombadier, government support is necessary,"" Sun said.

All major commercial aircraft companies receive government subsidies, he said. For example, when Airbus first took off, it received government subsidies and won support from local carriers such as Air France and Germany-based Lufthansa, before gradually taking a firm place in the market.

Boeing also received direct government subsidies on various projects, including the 787 project, media reported."

The German government is ready to grant a 1.1 billion euro ($A1.62 billion) loan to develop the Airbus A350 long-haul passenger aircraft, a senior economics ministry official said yesterday.

"Airbus details A380's new, more efficient Heathrow departure procedures - Flightglobal","Thu, 04 Mar 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWRldGFpbHMtYTM4MHMtbmV3LW1vcmUtZWZmaWNpZW50LWhlYXRocm93LWRlcGFydHVyZS1wcm9jZWR1cmVzLzkyMzIwLmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Singapore Airlines has been cleared to operate a more efficient Airbus A380 departure procedure at London Heathrow after a year-long trial at the world's most noise sensitive international airport.

The airline has worked with Airbus, the airport's operator BAA and UK air navigation service provider NATS to develop and approve the procedure, which has now been implemented and saves around 300kg (660lb) of fuel on every departure. Airbus says NOx emissions in the first 1,000ft (305m) are also cut by 10% .

According to Airbus senior acoustics engineer Nicolas Mouney the idea came originally from an SIA pilot, Capt Ray Chaudhury. ""When the airline introduced the A380 at Heathrow in March 2008, it continued with the procedure developed for its Boeing 747-400s to comply with London noise limits, which was to use TOGA take-off/go around [full] thrust for maximum climb,"" he says. ""After positive feedback with regards to acoustic performance, the captain suggested a revised procedure using the 'Flex' flexible lower thrust take-off setting.""

Although ""Flex"" is the usual A380 take-off thrust setting at other airports, for Heathrow departures SIA's original procedure required TOGA thrust and a rapid climb to 1,500ft. The crew then brought thrust back to ""CL"" managed climb thrust mode and continued the climb at a speed of V2 +10 (usually 165-170kt/305-315km/h) to 4,000ft before retracting the flaps and beginning the normal acceleration.

This operation was in accordance with Heathrow's noise abatement procedure requirements that define altitude constraints and a minimum climb gradient up to 4,000ft, which essentially stipulates to ascend to this height as quickly as possible.

The new procedure ""makes use of A380's good low-level performance and low noise characteristics"", says Mouney, using the lower Flex thrust setting for take-off and then acceleration after selecting CL thrust at 1,500ft to ""green-dot speed"". This speed, typically around 230kt, is indicated as a green dot on the airspeed indicator and gives the optimum climb gradient. The earlier acceleration allows the crew to retract the flaps, thereby reducing drag, fuel burn and emissions, says Mouney.

The A380 is the first Airbus type to have a ""noise"" function incorporated into its flight management system, enabling the target air speed to be programmed for a given segment of departure/initial climb, says Mouney. ""This provides an automated management of the noise segment, minimising crew work load,"" he says.

Once 4,000ft is reached, the aircraft automatically resumes a normal climb and speed schedule.

The revised procedure was tested between October 2008 and November 2009 as BAA wanted a full year to evaluate whether there were any seasonal effects on noise monitoring.

BAA says it intends to make Heathrow's other A380 operators - Emirates and Qantas - aware of the positive results of the SIA trial. ""We look to work with all airlines in order to minimise noise and emissions through optimal departure procedures,"" it adds.

SIA uses revised thrust and FMS settings for the new procedure

GTF able to power twin-aisle narrowbody: Pratt & Whitney - Flightglobal,"Mon, 01 Mar 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vZ3RmLWFibGUtdG8tcG93ZXItdHdpbi1haXNsZS1uYXJyb3dib2R5LXByYXR0LWFuZC13aGl0bmV5LzkyMjU4LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Growing interest from airlines in the development of a new lightweight, twin-aisle narrowbody is among the factors driving Pratt & Whitney to ensure its PurePower geared turbofan (GTF) engine can provide as much as 40,000lb of thrust, a top executive at the engine maker says.

The GTF has already been selected by Bombardier to power the 110/130-seat CSeries and by Mitsubishi to power the Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ). The CSeries will be powered with the 20,000lb-24,000lb thrust class PurePower PW1000G.

Yet, one of the reasons why Pratt & Whitney has ""gone as high as 40,000lb of thrust is"" that there are ""airlines out there looking for a light twin"", P&W vice-president next generation product family Bob Saia told ATI and Flightglobal last week during an exclusive interview in Dallas, where the engine manufacturer held a customer forum to exhibit some of its GTF hardware.

These airlines are interested in an aircraft with an ""[Airbus] A320, A321 seating capacity, so 170 to 220 seating capacity"" that offers a twin-aisle configuration, says Saia adding: ""The reason for the twin aisle was two-fold - cabin comfort, but another is can you turn the aircraft around faster in terms of boarding and de-boarding.""

It remains to be seen if airframers will pursue development of a twin-aisle narrowbody. Despite pressure from airlines to define their narrowbody replacement plans, Airbus and Boeing have instead been developing their current programmes to improve efficiency. Both airframers are looking at the possibility of re-engining their highly-successful narrowbodies, with decisions expected this year.

Some analysts believe Airbus and Boeing have stepped up their re-engining studies because a 150-seat variant of Bombardier's CSeries is in the works, but Bombardier has referred to such reports as ""speculative"".

Nonetheless, Pratt & Whitney believes its GTF is well-positioned to play a role in any of these scenarios.

""No matter what the application is, even if it were a lightweight twin-aisle, we believe the 40,000lb thrust regime would really cover that,"" says Saia. ""So if someone like Bombardier decides to go larger, or if a re-engining happens, or if Boeing and Airbus really decide 'we're not going to re-engine, we're going to do a new centreline aircraft and here's a new airplane' we can take all these requirements, and make sure we are ready to leverage the value of the gear, and have the demonstration to say, 'we know we're ready for this thrust regime'.""

With a fuel burn improvement of 15%, the GTF offers ""significant"" fuel cost benefits relative to a two shaft direct drive engine such as a conventional turbofan like the CFM International CFM56, says Saia.

""In the case of an airplane like an A320 or 737-800, you're saving about $750,000 per aircraft per year if you look at a CFM56 relative to our geared engine. So if you have a fleet like Southwest of [nearly] 600 aircraft, that's a significant amount of money,"" he claims.

Saia further alleges that the maintenance benefit could represent hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of additional savings per aircraft per year. ""Relative to the CFM56-5B, the GTF has four less life-limited disks and 1,500 less airfoils. The cost of these disks are approximately $100,000,"" he says.

""Relative to the CFM International Leap X, the GTF advantage grows. The GTF has seven less life-limited disks and a minimum of 1,500 less airfoils. The cost of these disks represent a savings of $20 or more per engine flight hour. These life-limited parts plus lower airfoils will enable the PW1000G to have a greater than 20% engine maintenance cost advantage over the CFMI offering.""

A further 2% to 3% reduction in airline operating costs can be realised by European airlines that face airport noise fees. And additional savings from the GTF will be realised when airlines in Europe are forced to pay penalties for CO2 emissions, says the Pratt & Whitney executive.

CFM International explains its decade-long development of LEAP technology has entailed extensive architecture studies focused on bringing the most advanced technology to every engine component, front to back: 3-D woven resin transfer molding, composite fan blades, a lean burn, ultra-low emissions combustor, next generation high-pressure turbine blades and third generation 3-D aerodynamics.

""Each of these technologies is constantly evaluated through a filter of their potential impact on reliability, which is something on which our customers simply cannot compromise,"" says CFM. ""LEAP is a more than worthy successor to the CFM56 product line and, we believe, the right choice for new or re-engined single-aisle aircraft applications in the future.""

Bombardier, meanwhile, is stressing to potential CSeries customers that a re-engined Airbus or Boeing narrowbody is not a new product. ""It's a refresh,"" says Bombardier vice-president commercial aircraft programmes Ben Boehm.

The only platform optimised ""nose-to-tail"" for the 100-149 seat market remains the CSeries family, he says. ""Engines are only one part of the efficiency equation.""

Bombardier on 25 February announced Republic Airways as its third CSeries customer. The US operator has agreed to take 40 CS300s plus 40 options.

VIDEO: Inquiry - Crosswind limit clarity needed after A320 wing-strike - Flightglobal,"Thu, 04 Mar 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vdmlkZW8taW5xdWlyeS1jcm9zc3dpbmQtbGltaXQtY2xhcml0eS1uZWVkZWQtYWZ0ZXItYTMyMC13aW5nLXN0cmlrZS85MjMzMC5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"German investigators believe that lack of clarity over crosswind operating limits contributed to a Lufthansa Airbus A320's suffering a serious wing-strike while landing at Hamburg two years ago.

Analysis of the incident - particularly the decision to continue an approach despite strong gust conditions - has revealed discrepancies by pilots in the interpretation of crosswind limits as presented in operating manuals.

Flight LH044's left wing-tip was damaged after it struck the surface of runway 23 when the A320 suddenly rolled to the left just as it touched down. The crew executed a go-around and subsequently landed safely.

German investigation agency BFU, in a final report into the incident today, states that the crew had opted to make the de-crabbed approach after being informed that winds were at 28kt, gusting to 37kt.

Airbus' A320 flight crew operating manual, under the term 'maximum crosswind demonstrated for landing, gives a figure of 33kt gusting to 38kt.

During LH044's final approach, however, the crew was told that the winds were still around 28-29kt but gusting to 47kt.

BFU says that a go-around would have been ""reasonable"", but states that the crew ""did not interpret"" the operating manual information prescribing a limit for the aircraft.

Concerned over the possible lack of clarity regarding operating limits, the investigators questioned 81 pilots from five carriers to understand how the term 'maximum demonstrated crosswind' is interpreted in practice.

The survey found that while half of respondents viewed the term as a limit, the other half considered it only a guideline.

BFU says this is ""evidence of a considerable information deficit"", adding that the terms used in the operating manuals - and by the carrier itself - are not adequately defined or explained.

""The answers to the questions on the permissibility of landings in gusty conditions call for clarification,"" it says.

Among 12 recommendations in its final report into the 1 March 2008 incident, BFU has recommended revisions to the nature of the crosswind information presented by Airbus in its operating manuals. It also says that airlines should set crosswind limits for their own specific operations."
Europe drops bid to supply US with military aircraft - EUobserver,"Tue, 09 Mar 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiIWh0dHBzOi8vZXVvYnNlcnZlci5jb20vbmV3cy8yOTYzNNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European aircraft constructor EADS on Monday (8 March) gave up a €25 billion contract to build tanker planes for the US military, which would have secured thousands of jobs in Britain, France, Germany and Spain, but no longer had political backing in Washington.

Statement on US refuelling tanker programme announcement

Student or retired? Then this plan is for you.

The contract, aimed at replacing 179 ageing American military tankers, was secured in 2008 by Europe's defence giant EADS, a Franco-Spanish-German company producing the well-known Airbus planes.

But during the presidential campaign, Barack Obama and his team lashed out against the deal for securing jobs outside the US at the expense of American aircraft constructors such as Boeing.

The Pentagon subsequently re-launched the bid last month and changed the requirements so that Boeing's smaller tanker model could qualify.

EADS and its American partner Northrop Grumman said in a statement they withdrew from the new tender because it was biased towards Boeing's ""smaller, less capable"" aircraft.

""It is no longer [a case of] the best plane and no longer fair competition,"" Airbus head Thomas Enders told Financial Times Deutschland.

The EU commission also expressed veiled criticism at the protectionist US move. ""It is highly regrettable that a major potential supplier would feel unable to bid for a contract of this type. Open procurement markets guarantee better competition and better value for money for the taxpayer"", trade commissioner Karel De Gucht said in a statement.

Ironically, Boeing had won the contract in 2003, only for it to be cancelled after an ethics scandal that saw a US Air Force official convicted of criminal conspiracy.

Northrop Grumman is not planning to sue the US government for changing the tender criteria, because it did not want to be held responsible for delaying the process further. ""America's servicemen and women have been forced to wait too long for new tankers,"" the company said in a press release.

A few lawmakers in the US also regretted the withdrawal, such as Alabama senator Richard Shelby, whose state would have seen 300 new jobs in a promised assembly line for the Airbus tanker.

""The Air Force had a chance to deliver the most capable tanker possible to our warfighters and blew it,"" Mr Shelby said.

But the decision represents a bigger blow to thousands of workers in Britain, France, Germany and Spain.

Under the trans-European proposal, the wings for the planes would have been made in Britain, fuselages in France and Germany, tails in Spain and the aircraft would have been equipped by Northrop in the US.

It is also bad news for the European company's global ambitions, as it already faces credibility problems due to delays and the soaring costs of its A400M military transporter.

The company on Tuesday announced it lost €1.05 billion in the last three months of 2009, compared to a net profit of €490 million a year earlier.

EADS reached last-minute agreement with customer nations last Friday, who agreed to put in another €3.5 billion into the airlift project, allowing it to survive."

The cockpit’s main displays will be 75% larger than those found in the Airbus A330, which will likely be the main competition for Boeing’s bid.

Other advantages touted over the likely Airbus entry include full control of the jet by the crew, “which has unrestricted access to the full flight envelope for threat avoidance at any time, rather than allowing computer software to limit combat maneuverability,” the fact that the new jet will save American jobs by being constructed entirely within the United States and a 24% fuel burn advantage which would save $10 billion over the 40 year life of the fleet. Boeing also highlights a new-generation fly-by-wire boom, and the fact that they are the only company in the running which has ever designed and constructed aerial refueling booms.

Boeing will submit its final design on May 10th. It is not yet known when Airbus will submit its proposal, nor when the Pentagon will make a final decision."

Following the push back from the gate, the flight was given priority taxi clearance on Taxiway Alpha for a westerly departure on runway 27R. At the end of the taxiway, Ft Lauderdale Tower ATC communicated a very nice tribute to Sully before giving him his clearance to line up and hold. In his usual professional voice, the reply to the tribute was “Thank You.

His impressive career began in the United States Air Force Academy in 1969. It was when he graduated there in 1973 that he received an award for being his class’ top flier. He went on to serve in the USAF flying F-4 Phantom II’s for six years before moving into the civilian world in 1980, flying for Pacific Southwest Airlines (later to become US Airways). He now finishes his 40-year aviation career with over 27,000 hours of flying, and will surely continue to play a major role in aviation by means of speeches and appearances to discuss his experiences and safety related issues."
SAA signs up for 6 Airbus A330 - defenceWeb,"Fri, 12 Mar 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuY2V3ZWIuY28uemEvYWVyb3NwYWNlL2Flcm9zcGFjZS1hZXJvc3BhY2Uvc2FhLXNpZ25zLXVwLWZvci02LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzMwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"South African Airways (SAA) has signed a $1 billion deal with French aircraft manufacturer Airbus to lease six new A330-200 aircraft from next year, introducing a new type into its fleet. The move follows last year’ s Airbus-assisted profit turnaround at the state airline and a resolution of a dispute between the two parties.

French Trade Minister Anne-Marie Idrac made the announcement in Cape Town yesterday, after a meeting with Minister of Public Enterprises Barbara Hogan. Idrac is in the country to promote economic ties between France and SA and according Finance 24, said the deal illustrated a “long-term and lavish” partnership between the two companies.

SAA last year bucked global airline industry trends to post a remarkable R398-million net profit for the year to March, a massive swing from a R1.085 billion loss the year before. CFO Kaushik Patel noted last September that posting a profit was “gratifying” following seven years of losses for the airline.

Noteworthy was SAA`s operating profit of R1.9 billion against a small operating loss of R72 million the previous financial year. This was, however, offset by a fuel hedging loss of R1.04 billion and restructuring costs of R474 million, leaving a loss of R10 million. Taking it from –R10 million to +R398 million was a R408 million reversal of a R727 million provision last year regarding the botched cancellation of an unwanted order for 15 Airbus A320 aircraft.

Then-acting CE Chris Smyth said the airline that thought it had cancelled the orders in 2002. A R727 million provision had to be made in 2008 after Airbus demanded that SAA make pre-delivery payments on the aircraft and SAA found it was contractually bound to do so following the bungled cancellation. Deliveries are scheduled to commence this year. Smyth also announced SAA had signed a memorandum of understanding with Airbus to lease six A330- 200s to replace its ageing fleet of A340-200s. SAA does not currently operate the A330.

Airbus vice president of sales, Hadi Akoum, said the long-haul aircraft, which will be taken up by SAA from January, will replace SAA’s existing and ageing A340-200s. “These will have all the latest, all the bells and whistles,” said Akoum.

The Engineering News Online adds this morning that SAA acting head of group corporate affairs Vimla Maistry said that the deal would boost the company’s recent gains it had achieved through a successful restructuring programme.

The twin engine A330 was one of the most extensively used longhaul aircraft in service today and would replace SAA’s six A340-200s.

“The new aircraft will be built and configured to SAA’s specification, featuring a refreshed cabin interior and an enhanced in-flight entertainment system ensuring that we continue to have a young, world-class fleet,” said Maistry.

The new modern fleet would consume significantly less fuel, which means that SAA would emit reduced levels of carbon and nitrous oxide, the most significant contribution to airline emissions, the online publication added.

A GOVERNMENT minister has pledged to keep a crucial contract to build military aircraft parts in North Wales and stop jobs going to Spain.

Yesterday Business, Innovation and Skills Minister Ian Lucas reaffirmed Labour’s commitment to the A400M during a visit to the Broughton aerospace plant.

He said the Broughton plant “would play a full part in the remainder of the programme.”

During a visit to the plant Mr Lucas, with Alyn and Deeside MP Mark Tami, met managers and apprentices.

In a joint statement Mr Tami and Wrexham MP Mr Lucas said: “The Government believes in the vital importance of manufacturing and skills training.

“We need to keep investing in value-added jobs, and the UK aerospace industry is at the forefront of this sector.

“This is something that the apprentices we met will be particularly pleased to hear as it is their future we are planning for.”

Airbus Broughton’s part in building wing tips for the delayed and expensive A400m military transport plane has been in the air for months.

The Government has come under fire for not committing to the project, leading Spain to put in an unexpected bid to build the aircraft.

Yesterday’s pledge should put an end to that threat to North Welsh jobs.

Earlier this month Spain made an audacious bid to buy up key manufacturing facilities in Filton, near Bristol.

It wants to ship them to Seville where the A400M has its final assembly line.

The move could have cut North Wales out of the cutting edge composite manufacturing loop and posed real question marks over long term manufacturing at Broughton.

But Mr Tami now believes that workers can expect to continue to attract contracts for building composite aircraft.

At the moment the UK has a 20% share in work on Airbus programmes and leads the way in wing manufacturing.

Senior Airbus executives said the company expects to begin commercial production of its delayed A400M military air transport plane by the end of this year.

Domingo Urena-Roso, managing director of Airbus Military, said the airplane manufacturer will increase output capacity to four A400Ms year in 2013, ramping up to eight a year in 2014 and to two planes a month in 2016.

Parent company EADS pulled out of a bid for 179 refuelling tanker jets for the USAF just days after American partner Northrop Grumman dropped out of the race to build the planes."
¿World's biggest plane to operate from Manchester Airport - Manchester Evening News,"Tue, 30 Mar 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbmNoZXN0ZXJldmVuaW5nbmV3cy5jby51ay9uZXdzL2dyZWF0ZXItbWFuY2hlc3Rlci1uZXdzL3dvcmxkcy1iaWdnZXN0LXBsYW5lLXRvLW9wZXJhdGUtZnJvbS1tYW5jaGVzdGVyLTg4NjQ3NtIBf2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbmNoZXN0ZXJldmVuaW5nbmV3cy5jby51ay9uZXdzL2dyZWF0ZXItbWFuY2hlc3Rlci1uZXdzL3dvcmxkcy1iaWdnZXN0LXBsYW5lLXRvLW9wZXJhdGUtZnJvbS1tYW5jaGVzdGVyLTg4NjQ3Ni5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Something went wrong, please try again later.

The world’s biggest passenger plane – the A380 - is to fly into Manchester Airport every day from the autumn.

Emirates Airline has announced that Manchester will become the first regional airport in the world to land the A380 – a double-decker aircraft that seats 517 passengers.

Airport bosses have fought off competition from around the world to win the service.

The superjumbo will leave Manchester for daily flights to Dubai and onward destinations from September.

The move was hailed by bosses as historic with the airport revealing that it has spent almost £10m on upgrading the airfield and terminal to accommodate the huge aircraft.

The iconic jet is already an eye-catching fixture at many of the biggest international airports – such as Paris, Sydney and London Heathrow – but it will be the first time the plane has been based at a regional airport.

Emirates Airline president Tim Clark said: “Manchester has been one of the strongest performers in our growing network of regional gateways, not only in the UK but globally.

“Our customers value our commitment to a regional network at a time when other airlines are abandoning them.

“This is a ground-breaking announcement for the airport and its global standing.”

The A380 will replace the existing Boeing 777, used for Emirates flights from Manchester, boosting capacity by 75 seats a day.

It will also introduce the carrier’s first-class cabin – which includes another world first – on-board shower spas.

Return fares will start from £539 in economy and £2,309 in business class.

Anyone with £3,087 to spare can travel in style in first-class and relax in a massage-equipped private suite, incorporating a work desk, an electronically controlled mini-bar and in-flight entertainment system.

Andrew Cornish, the airport’s managing director, said: “This is an historic moment for this airport and the region we serve.

“The A380 is as iconic as Concorde and her introduction into Manchester by one of our most important carriers, Emirates, will provide a daily reminder that regional airports can support successful long-haul services.”

Emirates, which has been flying from Manchester since 1990, say the plane is the most environmentally-friendly in the skies and generates less than half the noise of others on take-off."

We're entering the final countdown - the iPad is almost here. But what will it mean for iPhone gaming in general? Rumours indicate that iPad games will be more expensive. Do more pixels mean more cash?

The first handful of iPad games to be released, dubbed ""HD"" games, have been leaked and none have that hardcore experience that goes hand-in-hand with a higher price.

Will people pay more for Plants vs. Zombies HD? Of course they will - it was the fastest selling iPhone game ever when it was originally released, so you can be sure some people will pay a lot more for it.

What of the others, though? Only time will tell. Higher prices will make free editions all the more important - if you're going to pay more, don't you want to be doubly sure you're not betting on a stinker?

Our world may be about to be rocked, so perhaps we should dwell, guilt-free, on freebie and cheapie games while we can.

Airbus

By AppTwister

Type Full

Airbus sees you get behind the wheel of a VW camper can, driving back and forward along the same stretch of road, letting loose red balloons, trying to hit hot air balloons floating high above. Does it make sense? No, but we don't mind.

The hot air balloons drop objects on you, trying to stop you and your balloon-bashing ways. In each level, you merely have to hit a certain number of the hot air balloons to progress.

You control your camper van with the accelerometer, while taps on the screen send red balloons sailing up into the atmosphere. Quick, casual nonsense. We like it.

Ice Tycoon

By NC Japan

Type Full

It's not quite warm enough to start cracking out the Mr Whippy, but in the spirit of the upcoming summer, Ice Tycoon casts you as an ice cream vendor, juggling with a demanding clientele desperate for a coneful of the cold stuff.

In front of you lies your inventory of ice creams, cones, sauces, and toppings. Each customer rolls up to your ice cream shop, with an order floating above their heads. You have to tap away at your wares to make the right combo - any mistakes and you'll have to bin it.

It's a formula you've probably seen before, but Ice Tycoon's cute, clean visuals and simple approach to the genre make it worth a download. We'll take a scoop of mint with lashings of chocolate sauce, thanks.

Castle Fantasy Lite

By Croquis Co.

Type Demo

Mario's never coming to iPhone. We knew it from the off, but we're not sure we'll ever quite get over it. In the meantime, we'll have to make do with games like Castle Fantasy.

It's a traditional platformer that combats the tricky issue of trying to turn the touchscreen into a console controller by making all in-game movements very tight.

This makes Castle Fantasy's main character feel quite rigid, but it works. Apart from when your thumb starts slipping away from an attack button, precious few frustrations are caused by the controls.

Another point we should make - Castle Fantasy looks lovely. It's a 2D game but the world around you is rendered in 3D. Characters are 2D again, but drawn with real personality and bags of artistic skill.

True AxisDemo Last year's big race in the rubber-burning genre was between big hitters like Real Racing Need for Speed Shift and Fast & Furious . Jet Car Stunts took a completely different approach to racing - one more obsessed with fast fun than ""phwoar, look at that exhaust pipe"" posturing.

Its look is slightly cartoony, but the taut race engine makes striving for faster lap times very satisfying. In spite of a lack of bling and modded, tinted wing mirrors, Jet Car Stunts has become the iPhone racing favourite for many.

The lite version features eight full tracks spread over a handful of gameplay modes. It's one of the best lite packages we've seen in a while.

The Art Institute of BostonFull Art alone isn't enough to make a good game, as proved by Happle Game, a project of students from the Art Institute of Boston. Shameless Mario homage elements aside, it looks good enough. Just a pity that it's horribly, unforgivably frustrating.

Your character runs from left to right automatically. All you have to do is swipe at the screen to make him jump whenever a baddie or gap in the platforms shows up.

The tutorial assures you that there are different types of jump to perform - little ones and higher ones, naturally - but despite our best efforts, we were left falling down crevasses within a few seconds.

Your aim in each level is to reach the Sasquatch, a mythical hairy beast. We never got there, leaving us asking, just like in the real world, whether he really exists at all."
