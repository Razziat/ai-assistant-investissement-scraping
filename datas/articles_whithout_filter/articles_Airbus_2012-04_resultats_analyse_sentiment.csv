The center fuselage section, which arrived at the company's production facility in the belly of an A300-600T (aka the Beluga), can now be joined with the forward fuselage section already in place. Next to come will be the wings and aft fuselage, which are currently being built in plants in Germany and the United Kingdom

The first aircraft, MSN5000, will be used only for static testing on the ground. According to FlightBlogger's Jon Ostrower (he also has an excellent step-by-step account of the construction process), the first test aircraft to actually fly will begin final assembly in July.

Built of composite materials, the A350 is Airbus' answer to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which began commercial service late last year with ANA. As with its rival, the A350 is designed to be more fuel efficient and provide for greater passenger comfort for long-range flights.

But like the 787, the A350 has suffered from a series of production and design delays because of its radical new design and construction techniques. Though Airbus originally promised airline deliveries for 2010, the first production aircraft for launch customer Qatar Airways won't begin flying until 2013 at the earliest.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998860359191895}",neutral,0.9998860359191895,0

As part of its deal to sell 20 777-300ER jets to China Eastern Airlines, Boeing has agreed to buy five used Airbus jets from the Chinese carrier.

Boeing issued a statement Friday about the sale, which requires approval at the carrier's general meeting and from the Chinese government.

In a filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Monday, China Eastern said Boeing will buy the five Airbus A340–600 airplanes, worth about $707.8 million, for an undisclosed price. China Eastern took delivery of the A340s new in 2003 and 2004.

The A340s mainly serves long-haul international routes, such as from Shanghai to New York and Los Angeles, China Eastern said. But the four-engine jets are much less efficient than the 777s, which have two engines.

""The directors believe that the A340-600 aircraft have high operation costs and have relatively weak route competitiveness,"" it said, adding that the purchase of the 777s and sale of A340s will operation costs, optimize the fleet for long-haul routes and increase passenger comfort.

(Picture © Airbus. Photo by P. Masclet.)

This first A350 XWB airframe will be used for the static structural tests that all new aircraft undergo as part of their certification process. The assembly of the first flying A350 XWB, known as MSN1, will start during the summer.

The centre fuselage was delivered to Toulouse on 4 April 2012 by Beluga from Airbus in St Nazaire, France. The front fuselage was previously delivered from St Nazaire to the A350 XWB final assembly line on 23 December 2011. Delivery and installation of the aft fuselage from Hamburg, Germany, will take place in the coming weeks, followed by the wings delivered from Airbus wing assembly site in Broughton, UK.

A350 XWB assembly

The A350 XWB fuselage is made up of three main sections – front, centre and aft. These will be joined together at the first main assembly station, Station 50. The nose landing-gear is also joined here.

Once this stage is completed, the fuselage is transferred to Station 40, where the wings and tail sections are joined.

In parallel to this, cabin installation will be carried out simultaneously to the wing-fuselage join up, as well as the 'power on' of the aircraft systems. In this way, functional tests can start earlier than on previous programmes.

Composite materials

The A350 XWB is Airbus’ new family of mid-size widebody airliners. These aircraft bring together the latest in aerodynamics, design and advanced technologies to provide up to 25% better fuel efficiency and operating costs compared to current aircraft in the same size category.

Over 70% of the A350 XWB airframe is made from advanced materials combining composites (53%), titanium and advanced aluminium alloys. The aircraft’s new carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) fuselage is reported to result in lower fuel burn as well as easier maintenance.

The A350 XWB family consists of three passenger versions offering 270-350 seats.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999613761901855}",neutral,0.9999613761901855,0

All seven aircraft, scheduled to join several other A320 Family aircraft during the 600 hour certification flight-test campaign beginning next month, will test the production-standard Sharklets.

The current flight-test campaign, whose results will prologue to the certification of the company’s fuel-saving devices on each combination of aircraft and engine selection, follows the completion of an early flight-test with the A320 MSN 001 test aircraft.

Airbus will launch the first member of the family, CFM56-powered A320 aircraft, featuring Sharklets from the fourth quarter of this year.



The company also has plans to incorporate Sharklets in all of its Neo or new engine option aircraft of its single aisle family from late 2015.

According to Airbus, Sharklets, equipped on the A320 aircraft family, will reduce fuel burn by 3.5% and further reduce the annual CO2 reduction of around 700t per aircraft, equivalent to the amount of CO2 produced by around 200 cars yearly.

The Sharklets will further enhance the aircraft’s takeoff performance and increase its payload by 500kg, which will allow for additional range or more passenger capacity.

Airbus A320 aircraft, which can accommodate about 150 passengers in a typical two-class arrangement, and about 180 with high-density seating arrangement, can cruise to a range of 3,300nm / 6,150km.

The A320’s fly-by-wire controls technology enables total flight envelope and airframe structural protection further enhancing safety and reduced pilot workload, along with improved flight smoothness and stability, and reduced mechanical parts.

The aircraft’s operational flexibility is claimed to be mainly dependant on navigation technology, which includes required navigation performance (RNP) capability, global position (GPS) landing system, microwave landing system (MLS) and future air navigation system (FANS).

While a couple of A320s have been retrofitted with Sharklets in the past for testing, the new plane marks the first one built from scratch with the new wing-tip design. Sharklets are an option on current generation A320s and will come standard on the A320neo.

Closer in design to the Winglets found on competing Boeing 737 models than the wing fences they’ll replace, Airbus Sharklets are expected to reduce fuel burn by up to 3.5 percent, which in turn will cut the average plane’s annual carbon dioxide emissions by about 770 tons.

Sharklets must be certified separately for each model and engine combination on which they are offered. To accomplish this, Airbus is building seven new airplanes, representing each A320 family model (A318, A319, A320, A321) and each engine option (CFM56 and V2500). After about 600 hours of flight testing, the first Sharklet-equipped, CFM56-powered A320 will enter service with an airline in the fourth quarter of this year.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8449335098266602}",neutral,0.8449335098266602,0

Qantas and other airlines found tiny cracks, which the carriers say pose no risk to safety, on the wings of several A380s earlier this year and the Australian carrier is in talks with Airbus on compensation. The European planemaker is expected to pay some 105 million euros (US$139 million) to repair the miniscule cracks worldwide as part of its warranty programme but would not pay other costs, The Sydney Morning Herald said. ""It is not typical that there would be any compensation above and beyond the actual repairing of the product,"" Airbus chief operating officer John Leahy told the paper from the firm's base in Toulouse, France. ""We are traditionally responsible for fixing the warranty issues. ""(But) it's just like a new car. If your car has to go in for a week to have some work done under warranty, the manufacturer pays for the warranty. The manufacturer doesn't pay for you to go and rent another car."" Airbus, the main subsidiary of aerospace giant EADS, said the hairline cracks were found on some wing rib-skin attachments on a limited number of double-decker A380 aircraft. It said they posed no safety threat and had not damaged the plane's popularity with travellers. ""This is a maintenance issue -- it has nothing to do with the safety of flights. It is unfortunate we have to replace some of those parts but it happens,"" Leahy said. In comments to the Australian Financial Review, Leahy said overall the massive passenger jet was well received and there was surprise when one engine on a Qantas A380 exploded after taking off from Singapore in 2010. In that incident, the plane returned safely to Singapore but the uncontrolled mid-air explosion, caused by an oil leak in a turbine, triggered serious safety concerns at the time. ""There was a little bit of surprise when the Rolls engine blew up at Qantas but that was handled very well by Qantas and Rolls-Royce and people are quite happy with the outcome,"" Leahy said. The A380, which entered service in 2007, is the world's biggest passenger jet and a key product in Airbus's line-up as it battles its main rival US giant Boeing for the top spot in the world civil airliner industry.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8078233599662781}",neutral,0.8078233599662781,0

A Virgin Atlantic Airways plane flying from Britain to Florida returned to Gatwick Airport for an emergency landing Monday, forcing over 300 people to evacuate the plane using slides. Four passengers suffered injuries, the company said.

Fire officials said there were reports of a small fire on the plane, an Airbus A330-300, and it flew back to Gatwick about two hours into the flight.

""Due to a technical problem, the captain decided as a precautionary measure to immediately evacuate the aircraft,"" Virgin Atlantic said in a statement, adding that Flight VS27 from Gatwick to Orlando, Fla., carried 299 passengers and 13 crew.

The airline declined to provide further details on the four injuries or what exactly caused the emergency. But disputing the fire officials, a spokeswoman for Virgin Atlantic told The Associated Press the flight crew had been debriefed and said they did not see or smell smoke on board.

The airline said it was working closely with authorities to establish the cause of the incident and that Virgin Atlantic CEO Steve Ridgway went to the airport.

The flight took off at 10:48 a.m. (0948 GMT, 5:48 a.m. EDT) and landed safely back at Gatwick just under two hours later.

A spokeswoman for Gatwick said the airport was closed for more than 90 minutes as passengers on the stricken plane used emergency slides to get to safety. The airport reopened using a backup runway just after 2 p.m. (1300GMT, 9 a.m. EDT).

Virgin Atlantic chief Richard Branson tweeted an apology to those on board the plane. He said the airline's staff was doing everything possible to help passengers.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7378010749816895}",neutral,0.7378010749816895,0

Depending on the additional orders for the A320-family, Airbus is expected to increase the value of the contract, which is currently worth SEK701m ($103.08m) based on the order backlog for A320 family.

Since 2000, Saab has been supplying ailerons to Airbus and has introduced a new design and manufacturing processes in the development of composite ailerons aimed at reducing the product cost.

The Swedish aerospace company has also developed the new carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) monolithic technologies, which it claims have cut the parts number on the ailerons by over half.



Along with the ailerons, Saab also delivers mid and outer fixed leading edges for the Airbus’ A380 aircraft and the crew entrance door for its A400M military transport aircraft.

Offered with a choice of engines from the PW1100G PurePower from Pratt & Whitney and CFM International’s LEAP-X, A320 single-aisle jetliner family aircraft will deliver 15% fuel savings and a further flight distance of 500nm (950km).

The aircraft will also feature Airbus Sharklets, which are expected to cut down the aerodynamic drag by reducing the spiral-shaped vortices formed at the wingtips during flight, further increasing the pay load capacity by 500kg.

Airbus’s A320-family has an order backlog of 3,370 aircraft, while sales stood at 8,292 aircraft as of 31 December 2011 and had a total backlog for all aircraft of 4,437 for the period.

The aircraft maker said that it is currently manufacturing 40 aircraft per month and also has plans to increase its production capacity to 42 aircraft per month in Q4 of this year to cut the backlogs.

The aircraft, to be powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines, are expected to be delivered between 2013 and 2017.

The carrier will operate the aircraft in a two-class configuration on services from Jakarta and Denpasar to destinations in Asia, the Middle East and the Pacific, says Airbus.

The order, Garuda's third for the A330 since 2010, is in line with the Indonesian flag carrier's plans to grow its fleet to 194 aircraft by 2015.

The fleet, which will include Boeing 737-800s, Boeing 777-300ERs, Airbus A330s and A320s - to be operated by low-cost arm Citilink - will have an average age of five years.

""The A330 has proven to be a key element in the success of the revitalised Garuda Indonesia. The low seat mile cost and high passenger appeal make the aircraft a perfect fit for our fleet and a firm favourite with our passengers,"" says Garuda president and chief executive Emirsyah Satar.

UK prime minister David Cameron, who is in Indonesia as part of a trade tour of Southeast Asia, was a witness at the signing ceremony, together with Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.

At a press conference in Singapore earlier this week, Satar said the carrier's A330s will be put on routes to China, Japan, South Korea and Australia.

This year, Garuda will take delivery of 21 aircraft - four Boeing 737-800s, two A330-300s, 10 A320s and five Bombardier CRJ1000 regional jets, expanding its fleet from 87 to 105, after retiring three aircraft.

The carrier has six A330-300s and eight A330-200s in operation.

In 2010, Garuda inked an agreement with Airbus for 10 A330-200s and in 2011, for 50 A320s for Citilink.

For the full year of 2011, Garuda posted a 56% rise in its net income to Rp808.7 billion ($88 million) from Rp518.2 billion in 2010.

US Airways Flight 496, an Airbus A319 flying from Phoenix to Denver, was descending through 32,000 feet when it hit “severe mountain wave turbulence,” according to one of the plane’s pilots, as recorded in conversations with air traffic controllers.

One flight attendant was hospitalized with broken bones, according to The Aviation Herald. Another flight attendant and two passengers suffered minor injuries.

The plane’s cabin ceiling was damaged, likely from the force of people slamming against it as the plane suddenly dipped.

Other flights heard on the Denver Approach frequency, including an American Airlines Boeing 757 that had just departed Denver for Miami, were warned of icing and precipitation in the area. A private plane on approach to Denver also reported moderate turbulence and precip on descent.

Mountain waves are essentially waves of air that change speed and direction when they flow over a mountain, and can be exacerbated by certain cloud formations and atmospheric conditions. The effect of a mountain wave on an aircraft is similar to that of a boat sailing over a wave. A number of airliners have catastrophic run-ins with mountain waves, including a BOAC Boeing 707 that was ripped apart and crashed near Mount Fuji, and an Evergreen Boeing 747 which lost an engine while flying near Anchorage.

The NTSB is investigating the accident.

"Long a commercial power, Airbus is going military - Bangkok Post","Tue, 24 Apr 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbmdrb2twb3N0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9nZW5lcmFsLzI5MDE0NS9sb25nLWEtY29tbWVyY2lhbC1wb3dlci1haXJidXMtaXMtZ29pbmctbWlsaXRhcnnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Long a commercial power, Airbus is going military

Best known for commercial jetliners that have captured half the global market, Toulouse-based Airbus is working strenuously to establish a presence in the military side of the skies.

The A400M ‘‘Grizzly 4’’ visited Don Mueang airport last Thursday as part of its first Asia-Pacific tour. APICHIT JINAKUL

The European firm is counting on its A400M military transport aircraft to herald its drive into a business dominated by the US, both as industry leader and leading customer.

EADS, the pan-European aerospace and defence group that owns Airbus, is eager to ramp up the profile of its military business in a corporate portfolio currently 70-80% commercial aircraft related.

""We want to strike a balance between the military and commercial sides of business,"" said Ignacio Alonso, senior vice-president for commercial, strategy and industrial relations in Asia for Airbus Military.

Airbus Military is upbeat about the sales potential of the turboprop A400M, which has so far chalked up 174 orders from air forces in eight countries.

The company aims to sell up to 400 units of the A440M around the world over the next 30 years, Mr Alonso told the Bangkok Post in an interview.

Demand for military planes is generally in hundreds, not the thousands of orders common for commercial aircraft models, he explained when asked whether the target for A400M sales is too conservative.

Airbus Military believes that the key selling points of the A400M are its capabilities and its versatility, both tactical and strategic, which are not matched by any current military transport aircraft.

The A400M, notable for its plump fuselage, four daisy-like eight-blade propellers and a huge T-shaped tail, has benefited from new technologies, some of which have been borrowed from the company's civil jetliners, like the cockpit of the A380 superjumbo jet and light-weight composite materials.

The plane can fly up to 8,700 kilometres non-stop at a cruising altitude up to 11,200 metres and at speeds of up to Mach 0.72 _ similar to that of a jet-powered airlifter _ with a maximum payload of 37 tonnes.

The A400M, the first of which is due for delivery towards the end of this year or early next year to the French Air Force, _ with 50 orders, the second-largest buyer _ is positioned in size between the Lockheed C-130 and the Boeing C-17, the US-made airlifters designed in the 1950s and 1980s.

Alonso said if Airbus Military is able to sell the plane to the US, the US would become the largest market for the A400M.

""If we are successful, the US is not going to buy tens, but a lot more,"" Mr Alonso said, adding that America sets the global trend for military aircraft purchases.

He also said that non-military sales may also be made, particularly to groups engaged in humanitarian missions.

Southeast Asian nations like Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, as well as Australia, New Zealand and the Middle East, are on Airbus Military's radar for A400M business, according to the executive.

Last week, the company brought an A440M test plane to three Southeast Asian countries _ Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand _ as a part of its first Asia Pacific tour, specifically to showcase the plane to the region's armed forces.

Defence Minister Sukumpol Suwanatat was in the cockpit of ""Grizzly 4"", one of five A400M development aircraft, for a demonstration flight from Chiang Mai to Bangkok last Thursday.

Malaysia is the first and only Asian buyer of the A400M so far, with four orders.

Other buyers are Belgium (7), Germany (53), Luxembourg (1), Spain (27), Turkey (10) and the UK (22).

Mr Alonso said the A400M could play a number of roles in Thailand and could be utilised for humanitarian and search and rescue work in the event of natural disasters.

We hope to see the A400M flying with the Royal Thai Air Force in the future, he added.

According to estimates, one A400M costs about 130 million, but the price can vary depending on the sophisticated military technologies a buyer may add to the standard version.

Altogether, Airbus Military has sold more than 1,000 aircraft to some 130 military, civilian and government customers. More than 800 of these aircraft have been delivered.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.661913275718689}",positive,0.661913275718689,1

Airbus is about to deliver a luxury double decker A380 to the Saudi prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the chairman of Kingdom Holding Company, a major investor in Citigroup.

Ordered in 2007, it will be the most expensive personal jet, with a final price well in excess of $500 million, including the cost of outfitting it with one-of-a kind amenities.



The plans included a garage for two Rolls-Royces, a stable for horses and camels, a pen for hawks and a prayer room that rotates so it always points toward Mecca.

Eight minutes later, everyone on board would be dead. Bonin himself seems to have been spooked, calling attention to a metallic smell and an eerie glow in the cockpit. Robert reassured him that it was St Elmo’s fire, an electrical fluorescence not uncommon in equatorial thunderstorms. A few moments later the outside air temperature plummeted, the pitot tubes iced up and an alarm sounded briefly to warn that the autopilot had disengaged. From this moment, Bonin’s behaviour is strange. The flight recorder indicates that, without saying anything, he pulled back on the stick and, seemingly against all reason, kept the nose up, causing a synthesised voice to warn, “Stall! Stall!” in English as the airspeed began to drop dangerously. Robert took 20 or 30 seconds to figure out what was happening before ordering Bonin to descend. “It says we’re going up. It says we’re going up, so descend.” Seconds later Robert again called out, “Descend!” and for a few moments the plane recovered momentum and the stall warning ceased. But Robert was now anxious enough to call for the captain to return to the cockpit. Meanwhile, Bonin’s instinct was again to pull back on the control stick. He left it there despite the stall warning that blared out some 75 times. Instead of moving the stick forward to pick up speed, he continued to climb at almost the maximum rate. If he had simply set the control to neutral or re-engaged the autopilot, all would have been well.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.7119047045707703}",negative,0.7119047045707703,-1

Airbus Military offers C-295 for South African requirements - defenceWeb,"Tue, 17 Apr 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuY2V3ZWIuY28uemEvYWVyb3NwYWNlL2Flcm9zcGFjZS1hZXJvc3BhY2UvYWlyYnVzLW1pbGl0YXJ5LW9mZmVycy1jLTI5NS1mb3Itc291dGgtYWZyaWNhbi1yZXF1aXJlbWVudHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Military is demonstrating its C-295 transport aircraft to the South African Air Force (SAAF) in the hopes of receiving an order to fulfil its transport and maritime patrol requirements.

The C-295 arrived in South Africa to conduct a series of demonstration flights and exercises with the country’s security forces. Yesterday it airdropped paratroopers and this morning 7 Medical Battalion Group was briefed on the aircraft’s capabilities in medical configuration. After a demonstration flight for journalists later in the day, the aircraft was scheduled to demonstrate its cargo-carrying capabilities.

“Airbus Military has a long established partnership with South Africa and the SA Air Force. By bringing the C-295 to South Africa, we are able to demonstrate the aircraft’s capabilities in typical SANDF [South African National Defence Force] mission configurations for tactical transport, medevac, anti-piracy, countersmuggling and Economic Exclusion Zone protection operations,” explained Antonio Rodriguez Barberán, Senior Vice President, Commercial for Airbus Military.

Airbus Military is proposing the C-295 as a single-platform solution to meet South Africa’s requirements for new surveillance aircraft in order to support national and multi-national peace and humanitarian missions in Africa and its surrounding waters.

The C-295 visiting South Africa is configured with standard equipment, a Cargo Handling and Aerial Delivery system (CHADS) and is also equipped to support paratrooping, medical evacuation and humanitarian relief missions. It can carry payloads of up to 9 tonnes, in standard cargo pallets, or 71 soldiers in transport missions. Alternatively, it can accommodate 50 paratroopers.

The C-295MPA/ASW Persuader maritime patrol versions feature the Fully Integrated Tactical System (FITS) mission suite, comprising of a search radar, electro-optical/infrared sensor, magnetic anomaly detector, four multifunction consoles, sonobuoy or flare and marker launcher and three hardpoints for torpedoes, anti-submarine munitions or depth charges. Chile and Portugal have ordered the maritime patrol variant.

The SAAF is seeking to acquire new maritime patrol aircraft under Project Saucepan. Although no formal specification or requirement has been issued, the Air Force’s budget is expected to increase in 2013/14 to take Project Saucepan costs into account. As a result, a number of international maritime surveillance and patrol aircraft suppliers are keeping a keen eye on the South African requirement, including Saab with its Saab 340 MSA (Maritime Security Aircraft).

The latter features a Telephonics maritime surveillance radar, retractable Star Safire III Electro Optical Sensor turret, SatCom, Mission Management System and ship Automatic Identification System (AIS). Meanwhile, Raytheon of the USA are keen to sell the Beech King Air 350ER. Smaller, but more expensive than the Saab product, a basic system includes maritime search radar, electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors, AIS and onboard mission workstations with options for a datalink and drop hole. With an endurance of up to nine hours, the Beech King Air 350ER is often seen as the market leader.

Martin Sefzig, Director Sales Africa at Airbus Military, said he believed the C-295 fits both transport and maritime patrol roles as required by South Africa. He noted that Airbus’s support of SAAF C-212s and CN-235s means that if the Air Force bought the C-295, it would require very little added infrastructure to operate and maintain the type.

Airbus Military’s relationship with South Africa also extends to local industry, where Denel Aerostructures and Aerosud are both full industrial partners, providing design, engineering and manufacturing of major components for the A400M military transport programme. In addition, Cobham South Africa in Cape Town supplies satellite communications antennae for Airbus Military and Airbus commercial aircraft.

Sefzig said Airbus Military was also in discussion with a number of other nations in Africa regarding the C-295, with interest from West and East Africa. Ghana in August last year bought two C-295s and will be deploying one to Africa Aerospace and Defence at Waterkloof Air Force Base in September. Elsewhere on the continent, Algeria operates seven C-295s and Egypt has three flying and recently ordered another three.

After its demonstration at Waterkloof, the C-295 will fly to Lesotho, where it will be evaluated as a VIP aircraft. It will then fly to Cape Town, Dar es Salaam, Nairobi, Entebbe and, in June, will arrive in Gabon and possibly Luanda.

The United Nations has also expressed interest in acquiring the C-295 to replace its old, inefficient Russian aircraft. Last year the UN invited Airbus to demonstrate the C-295 in the DRC, which Airbus duly did in July. The United Nations does not own its own aircraft, but operates aircraft leased by contributor nations. Airbus Military, the United Nations and its partner nations are discussing possible procurement of the C-295, with Gabon emerging as a likely customer.

Airbus Military offers the C-295 for a number of missions, including firefighting, airborne early warning and control, oil spill detection, spraying and air-to-air refuelling.

The C-295 has little competition in its market segment, as it and the Alenia C-27J Spartan are the only new Western turboprop medium transports in production today. The C-27J is most likely also competing to fulfil the SAAF’s requirements, and was demonstrated at Africa Aerospace and Defence in 2010. The C-27J trumps the C-295 in terms of speed, payload, climb rate and range, but is far more expensive to buy and operate.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999880790710449}",neutral,0.9999880790710449,0

Airbus close to signing big deal with Garuda: source - SKNVibes.com,"Tue, 10 Apr 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vbS5za252aWJlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXdzZGV0YWlscy5jZm0vNTYyMDbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(London, GBR) - European aircraft manufacturer Airbus is close to signing a deal with Indonesian airline Garuda worth around 2.5 billion dollars, a source close to the matter said Tuesday.

""The negotiations between Airbus and Garuda are in the final phase and an announcement could come as early as Wednesday,"" the source said.

""The agreement involves the purchase of around 10 A330-300 planes for an amount estimated at 2.5 billion dollars"" at catalogue prices, it added.

Airlines rarely pay catalogue prices, however.

British Prime Minister David Cameron, who is visiting Indonesia, might announce the deal himself, the source said.

Airbus declined to comment when contacted by AFP.

A deal would be more than welcome for Airbus, which has only secured firm orders for 90 planes in the first quarter of 2012, compared with more than 400 for US rival Boeing.

In August, Garuda Indonesia, which is majority owned by the state, ordered 25 medium-range A320 Airbus planes for a catalogue price of 2.18 billion dollars.

The Indonesian archipelago consists of more than 17,500 islands and is home to 240 million people.

Its economy has posted strong growth in recent years and has a growing middle class that underpins air travel in general, and Garuda's expansion in particular.

Asia and the Middle East currently represent the best prospects for aircraft sales by leading manufacturers like Airbus, Boeing, the Canadian company Bombardier and Embraer of Brazil.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9991975426673889}",neutral,0.9991975426673889,0

IN the biggest deal ever for GE Aviation in Australia, Qantas has ordered $2 billion worth of latest generation engines to power its forthcoming fleet of 78 Airbus A320-neos.

The engine Qantas has chosen is made by CFM International, a partnership between GE and a large French aerospace conglomerate, the Safran Group. The deal will mean at least 156 engines (plus a few spare units) will enter service under the wings of the ultra-efficient A320-neos.

Qantas's budget airline Jetstar will be the first in the Qantas group to use the new craft as they enter service from 2016.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9955723285675049}",neutral,0.9955723285675049,0
"The best ""Premium"" business class seats: AirAsia X Airbus A330 to Kuala Lumpur - Executive Traveller","Tue, 03 Apr 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vdGhlLWJlc3QtcHJlbWl1bS1idXNpbmVzcy1jbGFzcy1zZWF0cy1haXJhc2lhLXgtYWlyYnVzLWEzMzAtdG8ta3VhbGEtbHVtcHVyLW1hbGF5c2lh0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Travelling in AirAsia X's Premium Class from Australia to Kuala Lumpur on? Here's expert advice on picking the best seats for your journey!

The plane and premium cabin

AirAsia X flies direct to Kuala Lumpur from Sydney, Melbourne, the Gold Coast and Perth, using mostly Airbus A330s outfitted with economy and 'Premium' class. (Some A340s are occasionally seen too, which have a different seating layout.)

The premium class cabin contains twelve seats which convert into an angled flat bed -- that is, the surface itself is flat rather than just reclining, but you end up sleeping at an angle to the floor rather than being completely horizontal.

Learn more about the difference between lie-flat seats and fully-flay beds in The Lie-Flat Lie

The cabin is laid out in a relatively spacious 2-2-2 configuration, which means no dreaded middle seat.

The best seats on the plane

1D 1G: you'll have about three inches of extra legroom in the bulkhead seats, and the centre pairs mean there's nobody clambering over you. But what you gain in legroom, beware that you might lose in potential disturbance -- there's no footguard, and people heading backwards into the cabin are likely to trip on your feet or at least bump into them.

2D 2G: we're usually partial to the front row where there are lie-flat seats, but row 2 is the one to grab for a relatively undisturbed overnight flight. (Of course, there's a bassinet crib position for infants right behind you in the first row of economy, but there are also three cribs in Premium -- so a baby-free flight is unlikely anyway.)

1A 1K: window fans should snag these seats, especially on the daytime departure from Sydney. There's more space to pick your way out over the aisle passenger, and a bit more legroom given the bulkhead too.

The worst seats on the plane

2C 2H: these aren't especially bad, but they're the most likely to see disturbance from people passing through and from the window passengers clambering over. If you're an aisle fan, you're best to pick the centre pairs instead.

BA prepares for its first fleet of superjumbos - Times of Malta,"Wed, 11 Apr 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzb2ZtYWx0YS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9CQS1wcmVwYXJlcy1mb3ItaXRzLWZpcnN0LWZsZWV0LW9mLXN1cGVyanVtYm9zLjQxNTExMtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Work to build the first of British Airways’ new fleet of superjumbos has started in a boost to the airline’s plans to fly more long-haul passengers.

The first of the carrier’s 12 Airbus A380s, which is the largest civil aircraft ever made and is capable of seating up to 853 passengers on two decks, is expected to be delivered next year.

Work started to build various sections of the plane across the world, including the engines which will be made by Rolls-Royce in Derbyshire and the wings by Airbus in Flintshire, North Wales.

The A380 is the largest civil aircraft ever made, with a maximum seating capacity of 853 compared to 660 in a Boeing 747

BA’s first superjumbo will help the airline fly more long-haul passengers from Heathrow, where landing slots are restricted.

The carrier has also ordered 24 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, which would make it the first airline to have both types of craft.

The orders of new planes are part of a £5 billion (€6 billion) investment plan over the next five years that includes refurbishing other craft in its fleet.

BA’s chief executive Keith Williams said: “We’re really excited that work has started on building the first of our 12 Airbus A380s.

“They represent a significant part of a huge investment by British Airways over the next five years in new aircraft, smarter cabins, elegant lounges and new technologies to make life more comfortable in the air and on the ground.”

BA has already raised the height of the roof on one of its aircraft hangars at Heathrow to accommodate the plane’s 24-metre-high tail fin.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9947863817214966}",neutral,0.9947863817214966,0
Virgin Australia readies new Airbus A330s with lie-flat seats - Executive Traveller,"Fri, 13 Apr 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vdmlyZ2luLWF1c3RyYWxpYS1yZWFkaWVzLW5ldy1haXJidXMtYTMzMHMtd2l0aC1saWUtZmxhdC1zZWF0c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Update: we've got first pics and full details on Virgin Australia's lie-flat business class seats on its new Airbus A330s.

Virgin Australia is set to raise the stakes in its battle for business travellers with the addition of two new Airbus A330s to its domestic fleet.

Both of the A330s are tipped to sport lie-flat seats in business class to improve the journey during transcontinental trips on Virgin’s ‘Coast to Coast’ service.

A revised business class cabin layout will also remove the middle seat found in Virgin’s two A330s which already fly Sydney-Perth, resulting for a less-squeezy 2-2-2 configuration compared to the current 2-3-2 arrangement.

However a Virgin Australia spokesperson told Australian Business Traveller that those first two A330s, which were bought 'pre-loved' from Emirates and currently fly Sydney-Perth, would not be upgraded to install the new seating or remove the middle seat.

The spokesperson also confirmed that every seat from tip to tail in both new A330s will sport the same 'Red' Panasonic in-flight entertainment system as on Virgin Australia's international Boeing 777 (which are now emerging from a refresh, as reported here).

The system will support video and audio programming 'on demand' rather than the looped video of the first two A330s, which also appear to be in for an upgrade of sorts. A Virgin Australia spokesperson told Australian Business Traveller the system in those A330s ""will be similar to the Boeing 777 (RED) system in the new aircraft.""

The first of the new A330s flew in Australia over the weekend and will be used for training cabin crew and technical crew based in Melbourne.

The second – which will be the fourth A330 in Virgin’s fleet – is slated to arrive from Airbus HQ in Toulouse on Thursday April 26.

Virgin says it will take delivery of two more factory-fresh A330s in the second half of this year.

Melbourne-Perth gets A330 in May

Virgin Australia tells Australian Business Traveller that the new aircraft will be shared among Virgin's A330 routes rather than dedicated to a single service.

This will include Virgin’s new Melbourne-Perth Coast to Coast service, which begins on May 14, and a daily A330 ‘morning peak hour’ service between Melbourne and Sydney starting May 15.

Virgin’s Melbourne-Perth A330 flights will run twice each day, departing Melbourne at 1pm and 5.30pm for arrival into Perth at 3.15pm and 7.45pm (local Perth time).

Return flights from Perth depart at 8.30am and 5.30pm, arriving in Melbourne at 1.45pm and 10.45pm (local Melbourne time).

The morning A330 shuttle between Melbourne and Sydney will depart Melbourne at 7.15am, arriving into Sydney at 8.40am. The return leg will depart Sydney at 10.00am and arrive Melbourne at 11.35am.
