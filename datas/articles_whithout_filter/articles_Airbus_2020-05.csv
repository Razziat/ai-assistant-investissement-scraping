Airbus officially opens its A220 production facility in the U.S. - Airbus,"Tue, 19 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIwLTA1LWFpcmJ1cy1vZmZpY2lhbGx5LW9wZW5zLWl0cy1hMjIwLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tZmFjaWxpdHktaW4tdGhlLXVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A new chapter in the development of Airbus’ U.S. production capabilities has begun with inauguration of the completed A220 commercial aircraft final assembly line (FAL) in Mobile, Alabama.

This 270,000-square-foot facility – which can produce both the A220-100 and A220-300 versions – houses five primary assembly stations where major airframe component assemblies come together for a completed aircraft.

An A220 first for JetBlue

Airbus’ production team in Mobile, Alabama also marked another milestone, welcoming the first component assemblies destined to become an A220 for JetBlue. This low-cost carrier will be the second airline customer receiving U.S.-built A220s when the aircraft is delivered in late 2020.

“The team is excited to start working in their new facility and to welcome a new customer,” said Paul Gaskell, president of A220 USA and Head of A220 Program in Mobile. “It’s a strong endorsement from JetBlue in this challenging time.”

An expanded U.S. industrial footprint

Airbus announced plans in October 2017 for the addition of A220 manufacturing at Mobile – which is situated on the edge of Mobile Bay along the Gulf of Mexico.

The company began producing A220s at Mobile in August 2019 using space in an existing Final Assembly Line hangar for U.S.-built A320 Family aircraft, and in newly-constructed support hangars. With the start of operations in the dedicated A220 final assembly line, Airbus’ production site in Alabama has now officially doubled in size.

“The expansion of our commercial aircraft production in Mobile – from the A320 Family to the A220 – further solidifies Airbus’ standing as a truly global aircraft manufacturer, and confirms that Airbus remains an important part of the American manufacturing landscape,” added Gaskell.

Mobile, Alabama is the second assembly site for the A220, which is Airbus’ latest addition to its product line of single-aisle commercial aircraft. The A220’s primary production facility and program headquarters are located in Mirabel, Canada, where dedicated functions – including engineering expertise and support functions – also are situated."

Airbus forced to furlough 6,200 workers in Wales and France to preserve cash as Boeing terminates joint venture agreement with Embraer

by J. Kasper Oestergaard, European Correspondent, Forecast International.

Boeing and Airbus delivered six and 14 commercial jets in April 2020 compared to 23 and 70, respectively, in the same month last year. With just 56 deliveries this year to date, Boeing is 116 shipments behind last year’s total for the first four months of the year. Airbus delivered a total of 136 jets from January to April, compared to 232 during the same period last year. Boeing’s deliveries have suffered for many months in the aftermath of two 737 MAX crashes and the subsequent suspension of deliveries and grounding of the fleet. Deliveries of 737 MAX aircraft have been on hold since March 2019. Due to COVID-19, both manufacturers have been forced to temporarily close down production facilities. For the full year 2019, Boeing delivered 380 aircraft, while Airbus set a new all-time annual record, handing over 863 jets. Prior to this, Boeing had retained a deliveries lead over Airbus since 2012. In 2018, Boeing delivered 806 jets (763 in 2017), with Airbus handing over 800 (718 in 2017).

In April, Boeing delivered just six aircraft due to shutdowns of plants in Washington and South Carolina, including one 737NG, one 777 and four 787s. Having temporarily terminated all commercial aircraft production between late March and early April, Boeing reopened some of its production on April 13, including the build line for the 767-based KC-46 tanker at its Everett facility. Work also resumed on the P-8A Poseidon in Renton and the 737 MAX at Moses Lake. On April 20, the company also restarted commercial production in a phased approach at its Washington facilities. On April 27, 2020, Boeing announced the restart of 787 operations in South Carolina. The first workers returned on May 3.

Production of the 737 MAX has been suspended since January. Prior to this, Boeing had been producing 737 MAX jets at a reduced rate of 42 aircraft per month. The 737 MAX jet is expected to remain grounded until at least August as software issues persist. Boeing hopes to win regulatory approval in August for the jet’s return to service, although that could be pushed back until fall. In the meantime, test flights and software changes continue. In early April, Boeing stated it needs to make two new software updates to the aircraft’s flight control computer. One issue involves hypothetical faults in the flight control microprocessor, which could potentially lead to a loss of control. The other issue could lead to autopilot disengagement during final approach. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has repeatedly stated that it has no timetable for the aircraft’s return to service. Southwest Airlines, the largest 737 MAX operator, has removed the aircraft from its schedule through October 30. In any case, it will be a few years before Boeing is able to hit the planned monthly production rate of 57 aircraft. Prior to the suspension of deliveries in March 2019, Boeing had delivered 387 737 MAX jets. In connection with Boeing’s first quarter 2020 earnings report on April 29, the company announced that 737 MAX aircraft production will resume at low rates later in 2020, as timing and conditions of return to service are better understood. The rate will gradually increase to 31 per month during 2021, with further gradual increases as market demand allows. Boeing also announced that the 787 production rate will be reduced from 14 per month to 10 per month this year, and gradually reduced to seven per month by 2022. The 777/777X combined production rate will be reduced to three per month in 2021. Production rate assumptions for the 747 and 767 programs have not changed. In April, Boeing announced that it has terminated its joint venture agreement with Embraer. The companies had planned to create a joint venture involving Embraer’s commercial aviation business and a second joint venture to develop new markets for the C-390 Millennium military transport aircraft.

In April, Airbus delivered 12 A320s (all NEO), one A330, and one A350. Prior to COVID-19, Airbus was targeting a 5 percent rate increase to 63 jets per month from 2021 and was also discussing a further ramp-up with its supply chain that could have brought the production rate up to as high as 67 aircraft per month, or 804 per year, by 2023, putting the company within reach of a total of 1,000 jet deliveries per year. Those plans have now been shelved. For the full year 2019, Airbus handed over 642 A320 family aircraft, of which 551 were A320neos. This compares to a total of 386 A320neo family aircraft deliveries in 2018 ,up from 181 and 68 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Airbus delivered a record 112 A350s in 2019, up from 93 and 78 in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Airbus increased the monthly A350 production rate to 10 during 2019.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Airbus has cut production on several programs for the remainder of the year. The A320 production rate has been reduced to 40 aircraft per month, down from an average of over 53 aircraft per month in 2019. The A330 and A350 programs are reduced to a rate of two and six aircraft per month, respectively. No rate cut has been announced for the A220 or A380; however, Airbus has delayed a planned A220 production ramp-up at its Mirabel facility near Montreal, where the company has been producing four A220s per month. In late April, following a three-week closure, Airbus reopened its U.S. facility in Mobile, Alabama, where it produces A220 and A320 narrowbody jets. Commercial production and assembly activities in Bremen, Germany, were suspended until April 27, while Airbus in Stade near Hamburg was closed down from April 5-11. On April 27, Airbus announced that it is furloughing more than 6,000 employees in Europe, including 3,200 production workers at its wing manufacturing site in Broughton, Wales, and another 3,000 workers in France. Airbus’ CEO Guillaume Faury has told the company’s 135,000 employees to brace for potentially deep job cuts and warned that Airbus’ survival was at stake without immediate action.

Turning to the orders race, Boeing did not book any new orders in April. However, the company reported it had received 108 737 MAX cancellations. During the month of April, GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) and China Development Bank (CDB) canceled orders for 69 and 29 737 MAX jets, respectively. In connection with Southwest Airlines’ first quarter 2020 earnings report, the airline announced a sharp cut in its 737 MAX delivery schedule through 2021 and is reviewing its order book. The COVID-19 pandemic caused Southwest’s first quarterly loss in nine years. Year-to-date, Boeing has accumulated 49 gross orders (304 cancellations => -255 net new orders). For the full year 2019, Boeing accumulated 243 gross orders (330 cancellations => -87 net new orders). For the full year 2018, Boeing booked 893 net new orders and 1,008 gross orders.

In April, Airbus booked nine gross orders and reported no cancellations. On April 1, Ireland-based leasing firm Avolon placed an order for eight A320neos and a single A321neo. For 2020 to date, Airbus has accumulated 365 gross orders (66 cancellations => net of 299). For the full year 2019, Airbus landed 1,131 gross orders (363 cancellations => net of 768), thereby retaking the orders crown from Boeing. In 2018, Airbus booked a total of 747 net new orders and 831 gross orders, thereby losing the 2018 orders race. Prior to this, Airbus had retained an orders lead over its rival every year since 2012.

At the end of April, Airbus’ reported a backlog of 7,645 jets, of which 6,746, or 88 percent, were A220 and A320ceo/neo family narrowbodies. This is 80 aircraft below the company’s all-time backlog record of 7,725 aircraft set in January 2020. By the end of April 2020, Boeing’s backlog (total unfilled orders before ASC 606 adjustment) was 5,314 aircraft, of which 4,298, or 81 percent, were 737 NG/MAX narrowbody jets. Boeing’s all-time backlog high of 5,964 aircraft was set in August 2018. The number of Airbus aircraft to be built and delivered represents 8.9 years of shipments at the 2019 production level. In comparison, Boeing’s backlog would “only” last 6.6 years at the 2018 level, which we use as a proxy for 2019 due to the severe drop in 737 MAX deliveries. This year to date, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio, calculated as net new orders divided by deliveries, is negative due to cancellations exceeding gross orders. Airbus’ book-to-bill ratio is 2.20, thanks mainly to very strong order bookings in January. In 2019, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio was negative, while Airbus reported a book-to-bill of 0.89.

NASA taps Airbus for commercial satellite data buy - SpaceNews,"Wed, 27 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9uYXNhLWFpcmJ1cy1jb21tZXJjaWFsLWltYWdlcnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Article was corrected May 28 at 11:35 am Eastern time. Airbus has two Pleiades and two Spot satellites.

SAN FRANCISCO – NASA intends to gain access to Earth observation data gathered by Airbus Defence and Space satellites through the Commercial Smallsat Data Acquisition Program (CSDAP).

NASA plans “to enter into a sole source Blanket Purchase Agreement with Airbus Defence and Space GEO Inc. … for unique commercial optical and radar satellite imagery,” according to a notice posted May 6 on Beta.Sam.Gov, the federal acquisition website.

NASA established a pilot program in 2017 to evaluate how Earth observation data from commercial small-satellite constellations could support space agency research and applications. Once the pilot program proved the utility of the commercial observations, NASA created CSDAP, an ongoing initiative to purchase commercial Earth observation data. Currently, Maxar Technologies, Planet, Spire Global and Teledyne Brown Engineering are under contract to provide imagery and data to NASA-funded researchers.

Each fall, NASA invites additional nongovernmental entities to apply for CSDAP if they provide consistent global coverage with a constellation of at least three satellites and collect data in nongeostationary orbits.

“We’re excited to continue to look at commercial vendors to help us complement and/or augment NASA and other U.S. government capabilities,” Kevin Murphy, program executive for NASA’s Earth Science Data System, told SpaceNews.

Airbus qualified for inclusion in CSDAP last fall but NASA has not yet determined what type of Earth observation data it will seek to acquire from the European aerospace giant.

“Once we have a contract in place, it will take about a year to understand if the products augment NASA’s existing suite of observations in a way that supports Earth system science and applied science,” Murphy said.

Airbus operates two Pleiades satellites and two Spot optical satellites as well as three X-band radar satellites.

“Airbus also uniquely provides a suite of elevation data products derived from optical and radar commercial data, providing elevation data ranges anywhere in the world covering all requirements from large-area coverage to high resolution,” according to the Beta.Sam.Gov announcement. Airbus’ “combination of 0.5 meter spatial resolution Pleides-1a and Pleides-1b visible and near infrared imagery; 1.5 meter spatial resolution Spot-6 and Spot-7 visible and near-infrared imagery; and radar data from TerraSAR-X, Tandem-X and the Paz satellites will provide improved digital elevation retrievals at monthly intervals for large portions of the Earth,” the announcement added.

An Airbus spokesman declined to comment on the announcement."
Airbus A380: The wondrous giant that never quite took off - CNN,"Fri, 01 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtYmlydGgtYW5kLWRlYXRoL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAUJodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi90cmF2ZWwvYXJ0aWNsZS9haXJidXMtYTM4MC1iaXJ0aC1hbmQtZGVhdGg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

There’s nothing quite like seeing an Airbus A380 for the first time. It’s so big – the largest passenger plane ever built – that its wingspan almost runs the length of a soccer field, and more than 800 people could fit in one if all seats were economy class.

The ride is exceptionally comfortable, a plus when a flight can be as long as 16 hours and take you halfway around the world. The cabin offers plenty of space and opulent amenities, making it a favorite among passengers and crew.

Airlines, however, loved it much less: Airbus was hoping to sell as many as 750, instead it’s scheduled to halt production in 2021 after just over 250 will have rolled off the line in Toulouse, in the south of France. It’s been in service for just 13 years.

With a list price of about $450 million per aircraft, the A380 is a technological marvel packed with forward-thinking engineering, but it was conceived by taking cues from a bygone era of aviation, which ultimately clipped its wings.

The lifespan of the superjumbos already in service may well be further shortened by the coronavirus pandemic’s devastating impact on the aviation industry. An aircraft that was once considered to be the future of travel is seeing its past approach ever faster.

So how did this giant of the skies come to take flight in the first place?

A European 747

The A380 was created as an answer to the original jumbo jet, the Boeing 747. But for a while, Airbus and Boeing briefly pondered the unthinkable: working together to create a new superjumbo.

In 1993, they joined forces to study the potential market size for a very large plane, but eventually reached different conclusions and the joint venture never materialized.

“In the 1990s we had just a 20% share of the aircraft market and we weren’t present in the large aircraft segment,” says Robert Lafontan, former chief engineer of the A380 project at Airbus.

“We wanted to work with Boeing because we thought it was a good idea to not have competition in that segment. But after a while, Airbus understood that Boeing was not ready to have a successor to the 747, so in 1996 the decision was taken to work alone.”

By 2000, Airbus was foreseeing demand for 1,200 jumbo jets in the following two decades – and planned to capture about half that market. Boeing’s estimate was about a third of that, which is why it decided to invest in new variants of the existing 747 rather than make an entirely new plane.

Airbus pressed on. The project, which had been known until then as A3XX, was renamed A380 and it attracted an encouraging 50 initial orders from six airlines.

“Boeing was making a lot of money with the 747 and Airbus wanted to be able to fly the same routes as the 747, such as London to Singapore, without any restrictions,” says Lafontan. “The goal was to offer a plane that was 20 to 25% more economical for airlines.”

The 747 had, in fact, thrived in an aviation world dominated by large hubs and a handful of carriers. Rising passenger numbers had created congestion at large airports such as JFK in New York, Narita in Tokyo and Heathrow in London, which were already running at full capacity.

The solution, Airbus argued, was a larger plane that could get more passengers out of those airports, without increasing the number of flights.

But that tide was turning. The “hub and spoke” model was about to disappear in favor of “point to point” travel. Instead of buying larger planes to carry more passengers, airlines chose a different and more financially viable route: buying smaller planes and using them to connect secondary airports, which were never congested to start with.

“The world changed,” says Graham Simons, an aviation historian and author of the book “Airbus A380: A History.”

“The industry, in terms of manufacturing, changed to react to what the airlines wanted and the airlines reacted to what the industry was supplying. The net result was that the 747 and the A380 would drift down in popularity, while smaller and more fuel-efficient planes would rise.”

The A380 was unveiled in Toulouse in early 2005 and first flew on 27 April 2005. Chief engineer Robert Lafontan also served as a test pilot during that period.

“I first flew the plane about a month after the maiden flight, and did several tests. One of them was a 100-ton overweight landing that didn’t feel like an overweight landing at all. It was so easy to fly, it didn’t feel like a large aircraft, it felt similar to an A319 or a lighter aircraft,” he says.

The only full-length double decker passenger aircraft ever built, the A380 is essentially two widebody planes on top of each other, although Airbus explored several configurations in the design stage. One of them had two widebody fuselages side by side instead, using components from the A340, Airbus’ existing four-engine passenger plane.

“We explored several configurations and fuselage arrangements, but in the end we followed a simple rule: to design the plane inside an 80-meter box, for airport compatibility,” says Lafontan.

This limit was set in the 1990s by airport authorities, when planning for future aircraft larger than the Boeing 747. The A380’s wingspan is just inches short of it, which allows the plane to operate using existing airport structures (although in many cases airport gates required upgrades to allow for A380 boarding operations) and to stay under the limit.

However, the constrained wingspan creates more drag at high speeds, increasing fuel consumption. Airbus also had to add last-minute reinforcements – and therefore extra weight – to the wings after they narrowly failed a load test in 2006.

The wings hold the plane’s distinctive four engines, produced by either Rolls-Royce in the UK or Engine Alliance in the United States. They provide a combined thrust of 240,000 pounds of thrust, capable of lifting the airplane’s maximum takeoff weight of 650 tonnes and achieving altitude in 15 minutes. They offer a range of nearly 15,000 kilometers, enough to fly from Dallas to Sydney non-stop.

Because engines represent a significant percentage of the aircraft’s overall cost, having four of them raises the price tag.

Compared to a twin-engine aircraft, they also require twice as much maintenance, use more fuel and produce more carbon emissions.

Although the A380 engines were seemingly state of the art upon their release, they were surpassed in efficiency and technology just a few years later, when the Boeing 787 was announced.

Ultimately, the A380’s wing configuration and its engines put it a disadvantage compared to the newer generation of long-haul, twin-engine aircraft.

Built for comfort

The plane included a number of new technologies in the airframe and avionics, but special consideration was given to the cabin to reduce passenger fatigue and increase quality of life on board, via a higher level of pressurization, lower noise and relaxing ambient lighting. These have since become standard on newer aircraft.

Lafontan says comfort was one of the criteria that informed the design of the plane from day one. Airbus even built a mockup of the cabin and sent it around the world to survey what passengers wanted, using these insights to influence the design of the interiors.

“The thing that got me was that on the main deck you can stand up by a window seat,” says Simons. “I’m 5 feet 10 inches, and if I get on a 737 or an A320 I can’t stand up by the window seat, because of the overhead bin. But on the A380, the cabin walls are virtually vertical.”

The cabin is also highly customizable, and lavish options are available to airlines, such as showers on the business deck. “The idea of a shower in an aircraft is just mind-blowing,” Simons adds. “And they have heated marble floors, and mood lighting that changes in intensity based on what the light levels are outside. Emirates put a bar down the back with an onyx bar top, and the protector they use on the bar top when not in use is not just a bit of cloth, but goat skin.”

Nico Buchholz, who worked at Airbus during the development of the A380 and then spent 15 years as fleet manager at Lufthansa, where he purchased 14 A380s for the German carrier, agrees that the plane offers unbeatable levels of comfort.

“For passengers and the cabin crew it’s a fantastic aircraft, because it’s quiet and pleasant, it sits in the air nicely, it has low cabin noise, and the pressure and humidity levels are unheard of in previous aircraft,” he says.

“Economically, however, when the price of fuel started going up and more efficient engines arrived from 2005 onwards, it started going in the wrong direction.”

Delays and cancellations

By the time the first A380 was delivered to its launch customer, Singapore Airlines, on 25 October 2007, it was in a way already behind the times.

Commercial aviation was shifting and more efficient planes designed for point-to-point travel, like the Boeing 787 and Airbus’ own A350, had just been announced and were commanding hundreds of orders.

According to Richard Aboulafia, vice-president of aerospace consulting firm Teal Group, the writing was on the wall.

“The only argument you could make if you were pro-A380 at the time is that history would reverse itself and times would return to a bygone era, when you had big ‘hub and spoke’ carriers that ruled everything and ran their national hubs like fortresses,” he says. “You had to go back to the Pan-Am days, in short.”

The project had also been hit by delays, which led to some airlines canceling orders, and although it would be years before the 787 and A350 would enter service, airlines could already buy a long-range plane that was smaller and more fuel-efficient than the A380.

The Boeing 777-300ER (meaning “Extended Range”), which quickly became the most successful 777 variant, allowed airlines higher margins with the same range of the A380, albeit with a smaller capacity.

“The 777-300ER started the killing of four-engine aircraft, whether it was Boeing or Airbus,” says Buchholz.

No US buyers

The A380’s survival has been directly tied to Emirates, which purchased almost half of all the A380s ever delivered and designed its whole image around the aircraft.

The production of the A380 could’ve stopped sooner if the Dubai-based airline didn’t order another three dozen A380s in 2018. But when even Emirates cut down its remaining orders from 53 to 14 in early 2019 – choosing to get A350s instead – Airbus had no choice but to stop production, as it was making a loss on each plane.

In the end, the planemaker’s $25 billion investment into the project will not pay off.

The main European carriers did buy the A380, but in modest quantities, and most importantly Airbus failed to sell a single one on the crucial American market.

That can’t be boiled down to pro-Boeing bias, because other Airbus models are extremely successful in the United States.

American Airlines, for example, operates the world’s largest fleet of both the A319 and the A321. JetBlue, the nation’s sixth largest carrier, doesn’t have a single Boeing plane and nearly 80% of its aircraft are Airbus. United has the fourth largest order of A350s out of all airlines.

“It’s just that the idea of a four-engine large jet in this day and age is clearly an anachronism,” says Aboulafia.

US airlines fell out of love with the beloved 747, too.

Delta was the last American carrier to operate a 747 passenger flight, in 2018. The plane’s latest variant, the 747-8 – which is longer, but not larger overall, than the A380 – has a future only as a freighter.

“The passenger version is now dead,” says Aboulafia. “It might linger on a little bit longer as a cargo version, but given what’s happening in cargo markets, I doubt it. It’s basically in the same boat as the A380, it’s just that it wasn’t a $25 billion project.”

There is, however, one thing that could allow the 747-8 to outlast the A380: It’s scheduled to become the next Air Force One.

Airbus has acknowledged its mistakes with the A380 project.

“There has been speculation that we were 10 years too early; I think it is clear that we were 10 years too late,” former Airbus CEO Tom Enders said when he announced in 2019 that production of the aircraft would stop in 2021. He stepped down from his role shortly thereafter.

Chief engineer Robert Lafontan believes that the plane was targeting a niche market, but he has no regrets on the design of the aircraft, which he says has paved the way for many brand new technologies.

While production will stop, support for the existing fleet will continue as normal, and Airbus expects A380s to be in the air well into the 2040s.

But the plane’s future is also tied to how the aviation industry will recover from the global coronavirus pandemic, and the A380 could be hit the hardest.

“One major problem is that there’s no secondary market to speak of and a lot of carriers, particularly Emirates, pride themselves on young fleets – so you could see 12-year-old jets being retired and turned into beer cans in record time,” says Aboulafia. “We thought the fleet would linger on until the early 2030s, now it’s possible they’re all gone by the mid to late 2020s.”

Although the large size of the cabin would help with social distancing measures introduced in the wake of the pandemic, it would be extremely uneconomical for airlines to fly A380s half empty.

And with low demand ahead, it will be challenging to fill large planes anyway.

“The A380 capacity, for a while, will actually not be needed,” says Buchholz. “My feeling is that quite a few of the A380 which are currently parked, may remain parked.”"

Airbus just bested Boeing, achieving a massive milestone in an area that's recently been haunting the American manufacturer: air-to-air refueling.

In the latest match-up in the cross-ocean rivalry between the American and European manufacturers, an Airbus A310 MRTT tanker test aircraft successfully completed an automatic refueling operation with a Portuguese Air Force fighter jet. Boeing has not yet been able to achieve the feat, even with its newest aerial tanker.

Airbus has been leading the charge in autonomous flight operations, with the newly-automated refueling process the latest step in reducing manual control in aerial procedures. In December, an Airbus A350 XWB successfully took off without pilot input, using software integrated to onboard cameras.

The system has plans to be implemented on Airbus' newest tanker, the A330 MRTT, with the certification phase scheduled to begin next year. The Airbus A330 MRTT is the European competitor to Boeing's KC-46 Pegasus.

Currently in use with the US Air Force, the KC-46 Pegasus is Boeing's newest jet but is also proving to be one of its most problematic. Boeing's Pegasus is nowhere near autonomous refueling, with the company needing to fix a key system before autonomy can be discussed, an Air Force official told DefenseNews.

Could This 'E-Nose' Replace Bomb-Sniffing Dogs? | Airbus E-Nose - Popular Mechanics,"Wed, 06 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHVsYXJtZWNoYW5pY3MuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvc2VjdXJpdHkvYTMyMzc3ODE2L2JvbWItc25pZmZpbmctZWxlY3Ryb25pYy1ub3Nlcy1haXJidXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus, in collaboration with biotech startup Koniku, is rolling out a series of bomb-sniffing electronic noses in aircraft and airports.

The companies hope to extend the use cases to biological hazards, including diseases like COVID-19 (coronavirus).

In theory, this could replace the need for bomb-sniffing dogs.

If you've ever boarded an airplane for an international flight, you've likely come into direct contact with a very cute but very formidable bomb-sniffing dog. Once you're on the airplane, though, the pooches aren't typically along for the ride, meaning detection virtually ends at the security gate.

To bridge the gap, aircraft manufacturer Airbus has partnered with the biotech startup Koniku to build a passive solution: an electronic nose. This 'E-Nose' could be installed inside airports or on virtually any surface within an aircraft cabin.

Bomb Sniffers The K9 Units Who Saved My Life, and Yours

""By using this kind of technology, we can unload the tension that is on security...and maybe use dogs for other purposes,"" Julien Touzeau, head of product security for Airbus America, tells Popular Mechanics. These dogs know what they're smelling, he says, but they're expensive to train, so why not free them up for specific tasks?

The sensors are made up of genetically modified living cells. Oshiorenoya Agabi, founder of Koniku, told the Financial Times that they modify either HEK cells (kidney stem cells) or astrocytes (star-shaped brain cells) to have olfactory receptors that can identify compounds by smell.

One reason it's so difficult to make these scent analyzers work is because unlike light and sound, scent is made up of mass, not energy. To tackle this problem, Koniku's jellyfish-looking sensors can analyze the smell's molecular structure to see if the scent matches the makeup of certain explosives, chemicals, or biohazards.



""The technology is based on the binding of molecules onto the surface of a cell,"" Touzeau explains. The sensor is looking for the presence of molecules associated with known explosives, and when they bind to living cells inside the device, it can ID a match and ""trigger a kind of cascade of events"" that the sensor can track. This usually happens within 10 seconds or less.

Airbus/Koniku

An algorithm can then send the pertinent data to a security operations team. What happens next is up to national security officials and the airport in question. Touzeau says Airbus envisions this as a system that can be deployed all throughout an airport—hundreds of sensors working together in sync to actively track persons or pieces of luggage showing signs of explosives, all throughout the airport. If one sensor detects the presence of an explosive molecule, the next sensor should pick up on the same a few seconds later, and so on.



Originally, Airbus and Koniku developed the new biotech sensor for contactless and automated chemical and explosives detection, but in light of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, the research team is extending its applications to also include identification of communicable diseases.

""There is no claim as of today that we will be detecting COVID-19,"" Touzeau clarifies. ""[But] we knew, from the beginning, that the technology had the ability to detect a bunch of different molecules."" He says the concept is to detect byproducts of the virus, like changes in the composition of a person's blood or breath.



Airbus/Koniku

Touzeau notes that the company is hopeful it can begin testing at two major airports in the U.S. and Asia by the end of this year. If Airbus and Koniku really do manage to get this e-nose off the ground and into the air, it could significantly augment security teams in U.S. airports.

Correction: Posted September 9, 2020: A previous story mistakenly referred to a company that created smell sensors as shuttered. It is, in fact, still operating."

The new 270,000 sq. foot hangar, where both A220-100 and A220-300 aircraft can be assembled, is officially open for business after an 18-month construction project. It houses five primary assembly stations where major airframe component assemblies come together for a completed aircraft in a flowline process.

Airbus began producing A220 aircraft in Mobile in August 2019 using space in an existing A320 Final Assembly Line hangar, and newly-built support hangars. With the completion of the new hangar, the Airbus production site in Alabama has doubled in size.

Another milestone was reached as Airbus welcomed the first component assemblies destined to become an A220 for JetBlue into the new hangar. JetBlue will be the second customer served by the Mobile team, with its first U.S.-made A220 scheduled for delivery in Q4 2020.

“The team is excited to start working in their new facility and to welcome a new customer. It’s a strong endorsement from JetBlue in this challenging time,” said Paul Gaskell, president of A220 USA and Head of A220 Program in Mobile. “The expansion of our commercial aircraft production in Mobile to a second product line further solidifies Airbus’ standing as a truly global aircraft manufacturer, and confirms that Airbus is an important part of the American manufacturing landscape. This A220 assembly line will help satisfy the U.S. demand for the A220 aircraft.”

The disruptive biotechnology solution, which was originally focused on the contactless and automated detection, tracking and location of chemicals and explosives on-board aircraft and in airports, is now being adapted in light of the COVID-19 crisis to include the identification of biological hazards.

Based on the power of odor detection and quantification found in nature, the technical solution, developed to meet the rigorous operational regulatory requirements of aircraft and airport security operations, uses genetically engineered odorant receptors that produce an alarm signal when they come into contact with the molecular compounds of the hazard or threat that they have been programmed to detect.

Airbus and Koniku Inc. entered into a cooperation agreement in 2017, leveraging Airbus’ expertise in sensor integration and knowledge of ground and on-board security operations within the aviation and defense industries, as well as Koniku’s biotechnology know-how for automated and scalable volatile organic compound detection (via their Konikore™ platform).

With in-situ testing planned for Q4 2020, Airbus is demonstrating its ability to accelerate traditional research cycles in a real-time environment in order to develop and bring to market a game-changing, end-to-end, security solution at convincing scale and speed, thereby contributing to the continuous improvement of security in the air transport ecosystem, while increasing operational efficiency and improving passenger experience.

Airbus has established yet another foothold in the US with the completion of a new production plant for the Airbus A220 in Mobile, Alabama.

Officially opened on May 19, the facility on the grounds of Mobile Downtown Airport will house a final assembly line for the jet, piecing together parts shipped from around the world to create an airplane. The plant sits adjacent to Airbus' A320 family final assembly line, where A319, A320, and A321s are completed and delivered to US customers.

JetBlue Airways will be among the first recipients of a US-assembled Airbus A220, scheduled for later this year as part of a fleet renewal. Delta Air Lines will also see more of its order for nearly 100 of the type come from Mobile, just 300 miles from its Atlanta headquarters.

Airbus first announced plans for the US-based facility when taking over the A220 program, then the C Series, from Bombardier. The Canadian manufacturer was staring down a near-300% tariff on the jet after receiving a later-overturned ruling from the US government following a dispute from competitor Boeing.

The threat of tariffs was ultimately eliminated following a subsequent ruling from the government but Airbus remained the majority shareholder of the program and construction of the facility began in 2019.

What I am doing, could be done by anyone.

Since I was little, I always wanted to understand how things work: how to assemble and disassemble everything, how to manufacture machines, I designed plans with my father… So now, I am an engineer.

I have been working at Airbus Helicopters for 13 years now. I work on the detailed design of helicopter parts in carbon fiber for the NH90 (a military helicopter), and I also support the production in Albacete, Spain.

This is how I got into 3D printing activities six years ago. We use the printers to make a pre-series before launching the fabrication of the molds.

When we began to see that the hospitals and nursing homes in Albacete did not have enough protective material and the virus started to spread among the health personnel, the designs to make protective visors began to circulate in the community of “makers”.

We first started printing a few at work. When the government temporarily ceased nonessential activities, I continued to produce them from home with my personal 3D printer. Some days later, I was allowed to pick up the machine from the office so I could double the output: I can do about 10 a day with each printer. Every night, colleagues from the “makers” community of Albacete, with government authorization, pass by the houses to collect the visors and distribute them to health personnel.

I have received photos of doctors in ambulances wearing visors that I made, which impressed me a lot; people who I do not know are calling me to say thank you. It is very nice feeling, but at the same time I feel a little overwhelmed: you know that these people, health workers on the front line, are counting on you. I am just lucky that I like what I am doing and I know how to do it, but there is no mystery: what I am doing, could be done by anyone.

My training and experience within the Reserves will enable me to support the NHS and other key agencies.

I joined the Reserves in 1997 and it has taken me all over the world – including Operational Tours in Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan. It has given me a great sense of satisfaction.

In 2012, I moved to Bristol to work for Airbus, where I joined the Royal Engineers troop. The unit carries out a range of roles within the Army, including combat engineering, demolition, and civil engineering construction.

My training and experience within the Reserves will enable me to support the NHS and other key agencies in building hospitals across the region, helping those who may need urgent medical care in the near future. Airbus has been very supportive of my role as a Reservist – I couldn’t have asked for more.

Sergeant Marc Turner joined 3,000 volunteer Reservists being mobilised across the country as part of the UK’s COVID Support Force to boost military aid to civil authorities stretched by the pandemic. The Reservists will use their specialist skills to provide logistical support to the NHS as well as engineering and cyber analytics to help fight coronavirus.

Craig Morton, Director of Airbus’ COVID-19 Enterprise Crisis Management Team, Airbus, France

In managing the COVID pandemic crisis, Airbus people have demonstrated an extraordinary commitment and made extraordinary efforts.

Craig Morton, a Scot born in Zambia, joined Airbus in July 2003. A diverse 16-year career at Airbus has prepared Morton for his leadership role in the company’s ongoing cross-divisional response to the COVID-19 pandemic – which involves 53 crisis management teams located around the world.

Leveraging his digital background, Morton worked with Airbus’ information technology organisation for three years before transitioning to security operations – where he spent a decade focusing on physical security aspects that covered Airbus’ facilities and employees worldwide to the company’s flight test activities and its participation at air shows.

“From 2006 to 2016, the company underwent a major worldwide expansion, giving me the opportunity to accompany Airbus’ extension into China, the Americas, India and elsewhere,” Morton explained. “This was an extremely valuable experience, especially as we deal today with a crisis such as the coronavirus pandemic, which crosses borders and transcends cultures.”

After two and a half years in Airbus’ legal and compliance leading Export Control for Airbus Commercial business lines, Morton took on his current dual roles as the company’s Head of Security Operations and its Head of Crisis Management.

“In managing the COVID pandemic crisis, Airbus people have demonstrated an extraordinary commitment and made extraordinary efforts,” he concluded. “They believe in what they’re doing and should be justifiably proud of what has been accomplished so far; they are individually and collectively a credit to Airbus.”

Jacques Le Sauce, Research and Innovation Programs Manager, Airbus Helicopters, France

Covideation is part of the global crisis combat by adding the best practices and creativity forces of our company.

I launched The OASIS initiative in 2018, while working in R&D. I wanted to create an internal and external network of people to connect and help innovators develop and prototype their proposals.

With the COVID-19 crisis, which has strongly impacted everybody on a professional and personal level, it was only natural that we wanted to help fight the virus. Therefore, we launched the Covideation initiative with the aim to identify ideas, help their originators connect, and to integrate selected ideas in the internal crisis unit and apply them as soon as possible within Airbus facilities.

There are many employees who have launched similar actions by participating in the ProtoSpace Hackathons fight the virus. Others create their own 3D printed components at home and send them to hospitals, retirement homes, NGOs or security forces. We help them to find additional 3D printers, supply materials, or produce more components with other means and partners whenever possible.

We also have a proposal to manufacture “add-on” door handles, which would enable a person to open a door without using their hands. However, the need is a few thousand for our site in Marignane alone! We help with Health and Safety validation and if necessary, by finding manufacturing solutions that are faster than 3D printing.

Other ideas include the introduction of UV lamps and use of air ionizers in the workshops and offices to accelerate the destruction of the virus. Here, efficiency and feasibility have to be checked.

A rapid evaluation and a deployment plan have to be done for each idea and all additional volunteers are welcome to efficiently accelerate the actions!

Some proposals are more scientific and potentially eligible for public agencies’ calls for ideas. The connections with research program managers and project leaders can be useful to accelerate this kind of action and increase their probability of success.

Covideation is an open door for employees to be part of the global crisis combat by adding their best practices and contributing to the company's creative forces.

Looking at the impact of the current crisis, all human action and initiatives will be necessary to recover a normal life at home and at work. Covideation is one of many ways to contribute.

I am Will Smith, a design engineer at the Airbus Wichita Engineering Center. I have been with Airbus since 2010. I am currently working on composite parts for the A321XLR outboard flap. I also spend time as an operator of the 3D printer that the office acquired in 2019.

On March 25, a Wichita area first responder started a Facebook group, ""Combating COVID-19 as a Community"", to help organize the crowdsourced production of face shields for area medical personnel and first responders during the COVID-19 crisis. The face shield consists of 3 parts; a polycarbonate shield, an elastic strap, and a 3D printed headband. The overall design was developed by Prusa Research.

Community members and businesses have been providing parts and a few people in the group have been doing quality control and final assembly. The completed face shields are then transferred to the Wichita Police Department and Sedgwick County Sheriff’s Department for distribution where they are needed. The long-term goal is to produce 7000 shields.

As an operator of the 3D printer at the Airbus Wichita office I’ve been able to remotely manage the printer and am now producing 4 headbands each day. During these interesting times I thought that the printer and our good stock of material should be put to good use.

I’ve also put my personal printer to work producing headbands, as have a number of other Airbus Wichita employees. In the first week Stephen Horn, David Shiflett, Kevin Gaines and I have produced nearly 50 headbands! I’m still trying to get more people on board so we can help out even more.

As of today ""Combating COVID-19 as a Community"" has delivered 300 completed face shields.

Andreas Fehring, Airbus Group Executive, Airbus France & Germany

Airbus’ response to this unprecedented crisis is built on the dedication of its people.

Andreas Fehring is a key player in Airbus’ crisis management during the COVID-19 pandemic, leveraging experiences from his 30-year career with the company – which has included roles in product development, sales, programme management and corporate strategy.

This prepared Fehring for his current role as the interface between Airbus’ Executive Committee and the COVID-19 Enterprise Crisis Management Team. “My role is a new one, created while the coronavirus crisis was developing,” he explained. “As a link between the Executive Committee and the 53 Airbus crisis management teams created around the world, I have been helping to accelerate decision-making at the very top management levels on subjects of health and safety, coordination, alignment and synchronization.”

With a background in mechanical engineering, Fehring joined Airbus in 1988 as a development engineer. He continually raised his profile over the years and beginning in 2006, headed up the company’s A380 programme management functions before taking on similar responsibilities for the A350-900. Fehring also has served as the Chief Operating Officer at Airbus’ Premium AEROTEC subsidiary – which is among the world's leading Tier 1 suppliers of commercial and military aircraft structures.

“As I look how we are dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic across all of the company’s businesses, it has gone well beyond having a crisis management manual and following the basic procedures in place,” he stated. “Airbus’ response to this unprecedented crisis is built on the dedication of its people, with the understanding that the priority – first and foremost – was to protect the health, safety and security of employees, followed by the focus on business continuity.”

It is a really great initiative supporting those most affected by the crisis.

I currently work at the San Pablo site as a logistics coordinator. Our site has been one of the main promoters of an initiative to collect food to help vulnerable communities impacted by the Covid-19 crisis. The Pre-FAL (Pre-Final Assembly Line) in Tablada managed to collect 500 kg of milk, oil and basic foods, while San Pablo was able to provide an additional 1,010 kg.

It is a great initiative supporting those most affected by the crisis. I am grateful to have been able to participate in this project before I retire and hope it will benefit those in need of aid.

A food delivery was recently made at the San Pablo facility to representatives of the Fundación Banco de Alimentos de Sevilla and city employees, who have managed to maintain their activities during these exceptional times.

The Getafe plant carried out the same initiative on April 27 where it obtained up to 850 kg of basic supplies for the families that need it most during the pandemic.

The Sevillian plants of San Pablo and Tablada joined a solidarity initiative last week to collect and donate more than 1,500 kg of basic food to the Fundación Banco de Alimentos de Sevilla."

Airbus military aircraft perform life-saving medevac missions during the COVID-19 pandemic - Airbus,"Thu, 21 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTA1LWFpcmJ1cy1taWxpdGFyeS1haXJjcmFmdC1wZXJmb3JtLWxpZmUtc2F2aW5nLW1lZGV2YWMtbWlzc2lvbnMtZHVyaW5nLXRoZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With the number of coronavirus patients mounting around the world, Airbus-built military transport aircraft are increasingly used for civil medical evacuation (medevac) duties in time-critical airlift flights – with the company providing valuable support for their air force operators.

The Airbus-produced airplanes enlisted in such missions include its large A400M tactical/strategic airlifter and A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT).

Airbus Military Aircraft - Medevac show more show less Air Forces performing Medevac operations in the fight against covid-19

A400M critical care missions

The UK Royal Air Force (RAF) has deployed an A400M on three medical evacuation CCAST (Critical Care Air Support Team) missions so far, transporting patients from the Scottish Islands – where there is an outbreak of COVID-19 and limited health facilities to cope with it – to mainland hospitals for emergency treatment.

Designed for global strategic and tactical air transport as well as humanitarian missions, Airbus’ four-engine, turboprop-powered A400M has the range, speed, operating altitude, and cabin environment to optimally serve the medical evacuation role. For CCAST applications, the aircraft utilises up to three specially-designed frames in the cargo hold to carry critically ill patients – each providing full intensive care capabilities in the air.

This unique configuration, coupled with the aircraft’s ability to fly at near jet speeds and land on very short or unprepared runways, makes it the optimal solution for medical evacuations from the UK’s outlying islands.

The UK’s National Health Service is crucial in tackling this awful crisis. If mobilising an A400M allows someone quicker access to the NHS and plays a part in saving their life, then all our efforts are rewarded.

- Alejandro S., Airbus Fleet Planner

The UK’s A400M fleet is backed by Airbus through a long-term global support service contract, with a company team based at RAF Brize Norton air base in Oxfordshire, UK – working hand-in-hand with the RAF to ensure operational availability 365 days a year.

“Flying these missions is of national importance in helping the NHS safeguard the health of every person in the United Kingdom – even in its most remote corners,” explained Ian C., the Maintenance Operations Coordinator. “We anticipate more critical missions in the coming weeks as this crisis progresses, and it is crucial that we deliver 100% mission success.”

Relieving hospital congestion

The French Air Force also has deployed A400Ms from its fleet for COVID-19-related medical evacuations, with the country’s first-delivered aircraft now transporting patients from congested hospitals within France to areas with greater critical healthcare capacity – complementing the military service’s A330 MRTT, also being used in this role.

The A400M was converted for medical evacuations using a configuration rapidly developed by the French military aeronautical research and test centre (Centre d'Expertise Aérienne Militaire) – applying certain elements of the CM30 medical evacuation module used in the A330 MRTT – and completed in record time.

“The high speed of execution was possible thanks to a study we had carried out in 2018, along with the excellent work and strong commitment from Airbus teams,” said the French Air Force officer in charge. “The trust and proximity we’ve built with Airbus over the years really helped us solve technical questions very quickly.”

Soon after its conversion, the A400M transported four COVID-19 patients from Ile-de-France to Clermont-Ferrand early this month – and went on to perform three more medevac missions over the following two-day period.

A multi-role solution

The French Air Force began flying the A330 MRTT for COVID-19-related humanitarian flights on 18 March, when its no. 1 aircraft – designated FR01 – transported six patients from EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg to Marseille-Marignane. Since then, FR01 has performed seven such medevac missions. The military service’s second A330 MRTT, FRO2, also has been converted for use in the fight against COVID-19.

Derived from Airbus’ widebody twin-jet airliner, the A330 MRTT is well-suited for medevac operations, with its large fuselage enabling maximum flexibility for up to 130 NATO stretchers to be carried over intercontinental distances. In a “light medevac” configuration, medical beds can be installed above designated fold-down seats. This allows the aircraft to be used as a troop transport on an outbound relief mission, with medical beds stowed in the lower cargo compartments, and then rapidly converted for medevac on the return.

In an “intensive medevac” configuration – which is being used to transport COVID-19 patients – critical care modules are installed to replicate an intensive care unit in the air.

A growing presence

The presence of Airbus military aircraft in the fight against COVID-19 continues to grow: the German Air Force is utilising A400Ms to transport COVID-19 patients from France to German hospitals in an operation supported by Airbus-built NH90 military helicopters from the French Air Force.

Also in Europe, the Spanish Air Force Medevac Unit (UMAER) has finished adapting an A400M from its fleet to carry out medical evacuation missions – capable of transporting up to five critical patients and as many as 14 for less intensive care. UMAER previously configured an Airbus C295 tactical aircraft for medevac missions.

Further east, the Royal Malaysian Air Force this month deployed its A400M – filled with medical supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE), including nearly three million face masks – to the East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak on the island of Borneo."

Air France has announced the immediate retirement of its Airbus A380 fleet as it no longer sees the demand for the 500-seat aircraft amid a slow return to normal for an industry plagued by the coronavirus pandemic.

The abrupt retirement ended an 11-year run between the French carrier and Airbus' towering creation that replaced the Boeing 747 as the world's largest passenger plane when it first took flight in 2005. While once the flagship of the European manufacturer, the A380's success has been slow-going, with only a handful of major airlines taking on orders for the type.

Initially intended to increase capacity between major cities and, in turn, reduce the number of frequencies that airlines would need to fly, the arrival of efficient next-generation aircraft like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner quickly made the A380 obsolete. Qantas CEO Alan Joyce, whose airline operates both the A380 and 787, noted that two Dreamliner flights could be flown cheaper than one A380 flight.

The French flag carrier itself only purchased 10 of the type and later focused more on the new twin-engine next-generation aircraft from Boeing and Airbus. Less than two years before its retirement, in 2018, I flew on an Air France A380 from Los Angeles to Paris, my first and likely last time on the Super Jumbo.

Airbus, which lost the competition in January, protested the award of the TH-73 that is slated to replace the Navy’s aged TH-57 Sea Ranger fleet.

“On Tuesday, the GAO denied the protest of the Navy’s contract award of the Advanced Helicopter Training System (AHTS) program to Leonardo,” Leonardo said in a statement. “As a result, Leonardo has immediately resumed work on AHTS in Philadelphia, readying the next generation of U.S. Naval Aviators.”

The contract, which is going through Leonardo’s Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based AugustaWestland facility, is valued at about $648 million.

The first part of the contract was for $176.5 million and covered the first 32 helicopters.

Airbus eyeing 'smell sensors' capable of detecting coronavirus on planes - New York Post,"Thu, 07 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIwLzA1LzA3L2FpcmJ1cy1leWVpbmctc21lbGwtc2Vuc29ycy1jYXBhYmxlLW9mLWRldGVjdGluZy1jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy1vbi1wbGFuZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sensors being developed by Airbus and a California-based startup might be able to sniff out COVID-19 in an effort to help prevent its spread.

Airbus is turning to California-based Koniku because of its know-how in building microprocessors made of biological cells. The two companies have already been working on biotechnology that detects, tracks, and locates chemicals or explosives on aircraft or in airports.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the technology is now being adapted to include the identification of biological hazards.

“Most infections and diseases cause slight changes to the composition of our breath and sweat, which then produce distinct odors,” Osh. Agabi, Founder & CEO Koniku, wrote in a blog post about the collaboration with Airbus.

The sensor’s receptors would trigger an alarm when “smelling” molecular compounds they have been programmed to detect, Airbus said in a statement.

“If we can detect those odors, we can detect the presence of those infections,” Agabi wrote, adding that the approach has already been used successfully with cancer-smelling dogs and detecting influenza A in breath.

“However, training dogs to sniff out the specific, subtle smell indicating any given disease is time consuming, unreliable and expensive,” he added.

Instead, Koniku would program the DNA of the cells that make up these receptors to react to the compounds in infected people’s breath or sweat, allowing them to screen for COVID-19 and determine whether a person is infected.

The solution is contactless, Agabi said.

“Airports, when they eventually open back up to commercial flying, will need to implement new processes and security measures to screen passengers for the virus. This is why we are extending our partnership with Airbus,” Agabi explained.

Airbus is planning to install the sensors, which mimic bomb-sniffing dogs, at airports or on aircraft, according to the Financial Times.

As of Thursday afternoon, more than 3.78 million coronavirus cases have been diagnosed worldwide, more than 1.23 million of which are in the U.S., the most impacted country on the planet."
Business Class on AirBaltic’s Airbus A220… Moving on Forward - Airline Reporter,"Fri, 29 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAyMC8wNS9idXNpbmVzcy1jbGFzcy1vbi1haXJiYWx0aWNzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMjIwLW1vdmluZy1vbi1mb3J3YXJkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Just a few days ago, I published my experience flying in airBaltic’s economy class on my flight from Amsterdam (AMS) to Vilnius (VNO). After after some great adventures in Lithuania, I was ready to hit the skies again — but this time in the front of the (air) bus — I was flying in airBaltic’s Business Class. I was excited to see how it would compare to economy and see how a low cost carrier would handle a premium product.

The airBaltic check-in & lounge experience at VNO

Check-in at VNO was quick and easy. VNO does not have dedicated counter space for any one airline. Rather, overhead monitors display which check-in counter is for which airline at that time, and signage can be moved around.

After I had checked my bag and gotten through security, I wandered through a large section of duty free items before finding the lounge. The lounge was mostly empty, and I didn’t have much time. The lounge featured a self-service bar, with some wine, Lithuanian herbal liqueurs, and other spirits.

There was a also a fancy coffee machine. At this early in the morning, I was not in the mood for alcohol but coffee was a must have. Specifically, coffee with two cubes of sugar.

There was also a spread of pastries along one of the walls. I was not hungry, and was going to receive breakfast on the plane, so I didn’t eat anything. Instead, I just grabbed some candies for later and made my way to a chair to enjoy my coffee. I had time for a quick refill, but had to chug it as boarding time was near.

Back to AMS — Time to Board the A220

The gate area at VNO was smaller and less chaotic than at AMS. The boarding process was similar to most airlines in the US, with everyone crowding the gate area waiting for their group to be called. Being in business class, I could have been one of the first to board, but I had arrived later due to being in the lounge and just took my place at the end of the line.

As I walked down the jet bridge, I noticed that our plane had a special livery. AirBaltic has three A220-300s with a special livery, using the flags of the three Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. The plane I was about to board sported the Estonian flag livery. As I stepped off the jet bridge and into the plane, I noticed that the door mat still said “C Series,” on it, but the fuselage had “A220-300” stamped beside the door.

The flight attendants greeted me as I boarded, and I found my seat. This time, I was in seat 2D, an aisle seat. AirBaltic’s business class is similar to other European business classes. There was a row of three seats, with the middle seat left empty. In the case of airBaltic, there was actually a plastic tray attached to the middle seats, prohibiting use by anyone. When I flew the now-defunct Joon’s business class a couple years ago, the middle seat was left empty.

The airBaltic Airbus A220 Business Class Product

After I took my seat and everyone had boarded, the safety demonstration began. A pre-recorded voice asked us to follow along, “even if you are a frequent flyer and know this all by heart.” After the demonstration was over, the flight attendants closed the curtain between business and economy class. They also offered me a newspaper, and I selected the Financial Times. I was the only one in business class, and the closed curtain gave me a feeling of flying in a private jet. The leg room was less than the exit row seat I had in economy.

Once we had reached our cruising altitude, the flight attendant asked if I would like anything to drink. Early in the morning, the only drink I desire is coffee. The coffee was served in a nice mug, white with a small, patterned green stripe opposite the handle. This mug was kept full during the flight, and represented impeccable service by the flight attendant.

The airBaltic Business Class Food and Drinks

The flight attendant asked when I would like to be served breakfast. Normally, my breakfast consists of just coffee. I wasn’t that hungry, and the flight attendant informed me it would take about 15 minutes for it to heat up. I decided to go on and have it prepared, even though I normally don’t eat breakfast.

The breakfast service consisted of a selection of bread. Since I was the only one in business class, they gave me the entire bread basket. The croissants were delicious.

This was followed by a tray full of food. An appetizer of fresh vegetables and cheese, the main course of a chicken and cream cheese omelet, and dessert with granola, yogurt, and honey. The appetizer and dessert tasted like you would expect, but the omelet was delicious. When it comes to serving a hot breakfast, airBaltic and Air Canada are among the best in my experience.

As I was finishing my breakfast, the flight attendants began service to the main cabin. As on the initial flight to VNO, they made a couples passes through the cabin to sell various items. The first pass was to sell coffee, breakfast items, and snacks in the main cabin. The second pass was to sell perfumes, colognes, and souvenirs. Like on the first flight, the screens advertised the items for sale. The rest of the flight was uneventful. My coffee mug was kept full, and my book kept me entertained. We landed at AMS about two hours after takeoff. As the plane pulled into the gate, another airBaltic A220 was parked next to us, with the Lithuanian flag livery.

The forward door opened, and I deplaned, making my way to the KLM lounge to wait until it was time to board my next flight, onboard a KLM 787-9 Dreamliner to JFK.

My airBaltic Airbus A220 Business Class Review Conclusion

Overall, airBaltic is a great airline for a budget carrier. Passengers who value legroom should definitely try to get a seat in the exit row. Those who want additional space can purchase the option to keep the middle seat empty. If flying works up your appetite, then business class is the way to go. Either way, your experience is sure to be more enjoyable than other budget options flying around Europe.

The A220 itself is a great airplane. Whether airBaltic, or Air Canada, it will have a more spacious feel than smaller regional jets and enable mainline service on multiple routes served by regional contractors. Fun fact: airBaltic was actually the launch customer for the A220. In the future, airBaltic is planning on flying an all A220 fleet.

Airbus launches A220 production on new Alabama assembly line - Made In Alabama,"Wed, 13 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hZGVpbmFsYWJhbWEuY29tLzIwMjAvMDUvYWlyYnVzLWxhdW5jaGVzLWEyMjAtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1vbi1uZXctYWxhYmFtYS1hc3NlbWJseS1saW5lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The facility houses five primary assembly stations where major airframe component assemblies come together for a completed aircraft in a flowline process.

Airbus initially began producing A220 aircraft in Mobile in August 2019 using space in an existing A320 Final Assembly Line hangar and new support hangars. With the completion of the new Final Assembly Line hangar, the Airbus production site in Alabama has now doubled in size.

“The expansion of our commercial aircraft production in Mobile to a second product line further solidifies Airbus’ standing as a truly global aircraft manufacturer and confirms that Airbus is an important part of the American manufacturing landscape,” Gaskell said.

“This A220 assembly line will help satisfy the U.S. demand for the A220 aircraft.”

Airbus said another milestone was reached as the first component assemblies destined to become an A220 for JetBlue arrived at the new hangar.

JetBlue will be the second customer served by the Mobile team, with its first U.S.-made A220 scheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter.

Airbus announced plans for A220 aircraft manufacturing in Mobile in October 2017.

“The opening of Airbus’ A220 Final Assembly Line in Mobile demonstrates the company’s commitment to aircraft production in the United States, and Alabama is proud to be the home of its growing U.S. manufacturing presence,” said Greg Canfield, Secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce.

“This marks another significant milestone for Airbus and its Mobile production center, and we look forward to seeing many others in the future.”"

Twin-engine Airbus H135 underbid Leonardo's successful TH-119 for Navy trainer - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 20 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvdHdpbi1lbmdpbmUtYWlyYnVzLWgxMzUtdW5kZXJiaWQtbGVvbmFyZG9zLXN1Y2Nlc3NmdWwtdGgtMTE5LWZvci1uYXZ5LXRyYWluZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Pitching the twin-engine H135 as the U.S. Navy’s next training helicopter did not keep Airbus from underbidding winner Leonardo Helicopters’ TH-119 by nearly $100 million, according to a lightly redacted Government Accountability Report published May 12.

The report details Airbus’s unsuccessful protest of the Navy’s decision to buy the Leonardo helicopter

Until the GAO report was published, it was widely assumed Airbus’s biggest liability was the upfront and operational cost of the heavier, twin-engine H135. Both the TH-119 and incumbent Bell’s 407GXi are single-engine helicopters that earned the required instrument flight rules (IFR) certification during the evaluation process.

The GAO report shows the Airbus bid came in lower than Leonardo’s. The total evaluated price — consisting of the sum cost of 130 aircraft and a 10-year projected operation and support cost — for the Airbus H135 came in at $1.31 billion whereas Leonardo projected the TH-119 would ultimately cost $1.39 billion, according to the document.

In its protest, Airbus primarily argued that the Navy “unreasonably and disparately evaluated the offerors’ technical proposals,” meaning the aircraft themselves and that the Navy’s decision was unreasonable and “based on a flawed technical evaluation,” the GAO says. Through the analysis of the program done since Airbus filed the protest Feb. 3, the GAO found “no basis to sustain the protest.”

“Airbus’s initial and supplemental protests raise multiple allegations,” the GAO report says. “While our decision here does not specifically discuss each and every argument or variation of the arguments, we have considered all of Airbus’s assertions and find no basis to sustain the protest.”

The Navy in January chose Leonardo’s TH-119, based on the commercial AW119, over the Airbus H135 and Bell 407GXi and two other offers to replace the aging TH-57 Sea Rangers on which all Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard rotorcraft pilots are trained.

Leonardo is now working under an initial $176.5 million outlay that covers construction and delivery of the first 32 of 130 aircraft the Navy will call the TH-73A.

Airbus stood out in the competition for offering the twin-engine H135, which is more expensive upfront and more costly to operate. The company made the argument that the H135 was more representative of the advanced fleet aircraft pilots would fly after graduation from flight training.

In both “technical” and “aircraft system” subcategories, Leonardo’s TH-119 scored “outstanding” marks where the H135 was deemed “good”, a lower rating. Both aircraft merited an outstanding rating for management and support, according to the GAO report.

Airbus also was deemed a “moderate risk” in aircraft system and “low risk” in managements and support in technical evaluations of its final proposal. Leonardo was a low risk across the board, the Navy found and GAO upheld.

In its protest of the award, Airbus argued that the twin-engine H135 was previously certified by the FAA to fly under instrument-flight-rules (IFR), a signature Navy requirement, was more similar than its competitors to advanced fleet aircraft like the H-60 and H-53 helicopters and therefore the best value for the Navy.

The Navy was not swayed by Airbus’ primary argument for the H135 because it required only a current IFR certification and similarity to fleet aircraft was not a criteria for consideration, GAO found.

“The record shows that the solicitation required that the proposed aircraft have a ‘current’ IFR certification, but did not require that such IFR certification be well-established or mature,” the GAO found. “Moreover, the solicitation never stated that the proposed aircraft would be evaluated on its similarity to the current Navy fleet.”

In its evaluation, the Navy assigned the H135 a “significant weakness” for several performance criteria, including for autorotation. On the other hand, it earned eight “risk reducers” under the overall compliance element, one strength for warfighting skills training, and one strength for safety.

Autorotation to the ground is a required skill for graduation from Navy initial rotorcraft pilot training. During the source selection process, analysts questioned whether a twin-engine aircraft, with its added weight, was a wise choice given the requirement to perform repeated autorotations, which put stress on the airframe."
Airbus reaffirms commitment to CityAirbus eVTOL program - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 05 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWNpdHlhaXJidXMtZXZ0b2wtYWlyLXRheGktcHJvZ3JhbS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus plans to continue development of its CityAirbus eVTOL despite the far-reaching impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on its larger business.

“Airbus considers new forms of air transport such as UAM [urban air mobility] an opportunity to develop key technologies for the future of VTOL platforms, including electric flight and autonomy,” an Airbus spokesperson told Vertical on May 5. “As such, we are continuing the test program of our technology demonstrator CityAirbus.”

The CityAirbus multicopter is a fully electric, 2.2-tonne air taxi prototype that made its first tethered take-off in May 2019 and began free flight testing at the end of the year. Like its tilt-wing predecessor, Vahana, CityAirbus is being used to gather insights that will inform the development of future eVTOL models.

CityAirbus has been developed at Airbus Helicopters’ facilities in Donauwörth, Germany, with plans to conduct more extensive flight testing in Manching, around 70 kilometers (45 miles) east.

“The test campaign is ongoing, the expansion of the flight envelope in Manching is on the agenda, but due to the current situation we can’t give a timeframe,” the spokesperson said. “Of course Covid-19 has slowed down everything.”

While the pandemic has merely slowed the progress of CityAirbus, it has brought other programs to a halt amid what Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury described as “the gravest crisis the aerospace industry has ever known.”

Notably, on April 24, Airbus and Rolls-Royce announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate their E-Fan X program, a hybrid-electric technology demonstrator based on a BAe 146 regional airliner.

“As with all such leading-edge programs, we constantly evaluate the best way forward and it has become clear to both parties that the actual requirement to carry out a test flight with all the elements integrated is not critical at this time,” explained Rolls-Royce chief technology officer (CTO) Paul Stein in announcing the decision to end the project.

Airbus CTO Grazia Vittadini emphasized that Airbus nevertheless remains fully committed to decarbonizing aviation, and has used its learnings from the E-Fan X program to develop “a more focused roadmap on how to progress on our ambitious decarbonization commitments.”

“We’re steadfast in our belief that there’s no world in which the future of air travel is not a sustainable one,” she stated. “As we start to navigate the realities of a post-Covid-19 world, I’m more certain than ever that we need to continue full speed ahead with our sustainability ambitions.”"

Release Date May 7, 2020 The case against the Airbus A220 and Embraer E2 Purchase a PDF of this article

Overcoming incumbent fleet commonality remains a key challenge for the new small narrow-bodies, especially with a renewed focus on reduced risk and cash expenditures by the airlines.

Even though traffic declines should benefit smaller aircraft, it could have an opposite effect as networks are redesigned for the large aircraft that remain in the fleets.

In the immediate term, cash is king. Purchasing any new aircraft will be a challenging prospect for years, and without a large presence in current fleets by the Embraer E2 and Airbus A220, it may slow the adoption of the sector.

As COVID-19 obliterates commercial aviation, a conventional wisdom has set in that gives an edge to small airplanes. It’s not that simple.

Purchasing commercial aircraft is a complicated process. Beyond the legal and financial challenges of completing the purchase, simply coming to an internal agreement can be an exercise in organizational decision making.

Related: Embraer can survive solo, but outlook mixed after Boeing breakup

As complicated as it may be to align network requirements with aircraft size, range, and efficiency, the realities of operating the new aircraft extend well beyond the fleet and network planning teams. The ability to maintain, staff, and recover from disruptions can stress even the most optimized network. The lack of third-party support and unknown lifecycle costs can impose damaging impacts to an airline’s cash flow, even if the aircraft is perfectly sized for the market. These are huge hurdles that must be cleared.

Such are the challenges new small narrow-bodies, the E2 series from Embraer and Airbus’s A220 face. Originally dominated by stalwarts such as the DC-9 and 737-200, as the market grew and single-aisles became more capable and economical, the 100-seat segment has dwindled to a fraction of its former size. Beneath this small narrow-body in size, lies the regional jet and its explosive growth during the same period, at the expense of the 100-seater.

With new small narrow-body aircraft entering the scene from traditional regional jet manufacturers (the Airbus A220 started life as the Bombardier C Series), renewed attention has been placed on the segment. Yet, even with the massive market demonstrated by earlier generations of small narrow-bodies, adoption has been slow – a testament to the myriad of decision points airlines face, and the hurdles each represents for the new fleet of old.

Especially in the new world that’s being reshaped by the global pandemic, where the risk of shutting down air travel is a reality rather than a deep contingency, the equation has further changed. This crisis unlike any the commercial aviation industry has never seen, has disrupted more than networks and cash flows. It will have long lasting effects on the aircraft purchasing decision process, and one that will have a disproportionate effect on the small narrow-body market.

In this TAC Analysis, we review these effects, both past and present, review the challenges of the new small narrow-body market, and how the coronavirus has made the argument for the small narrow-body a more challenging prospect."

By Scott Hamilton

May 18, 2020, © Leeham News: As airlines park or retire thousands of aircraft, lessors with wide-body airplanes are most at risk.

Single-aisle airplanes are easier to re-lease and more in demand when traffic recovers. Reconfiguration and maintenance costs, if required, are reasonable by aviation standards. Cabin reconfiguration may run up to $1m. Airframe and engine MRO costs for Airbus A320s and Boeing 737s typically are in the low millions, depending on condition.

MRO and reconfigurations costs for wide-body airplanes, on the other hand, can cost more than a new A320 or 737. GE Aviation GE90s on Boeing 777-200LRs, -300s and -300ERs are notoriously expensive. MRO for Rolls-Royce wide-body engines is costly under RR’s contract packages.

Reconfiguration costs for A330s, 777s and A380s can run up to $30m, depending on the initial operator and who the second (or third) one will be. Therefore, HiFly did not reconfigure the ex-Singapore Airlines Airbus A380 it acquired after SQ retired the airplane.

LNA analyzed the number of wide-bodies owned by lessors. There are more than 670 Airbuses and more than 600 Boeings."

Could the Airbus A220 emerge a winner from the coronavirus crisis? - The Points Guy,"Mon, 11 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1hMjIwLXBvcHVsYXItYWlybGluZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"There are winners and losers of every crisis in the aviation industry. The coronavirus pandemic has already forced some airlines, like Virgin Australia, into restructuring. It's also grounded many large aircraft like the Airbus A380, but an emerging winner may be a Canadian jet that recently got a new lease on life and is now proving its worth.

That jet is the Airbus A220, formerly the Bombardier CSeries. The plane benefits from its small size and low operating costs coupled with operating capabilities that rival larger planes like the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737. These are proving assets to airlines looking to slash expenses while maintaining a minimal flight schedule through the COVID-19 crisis.

""When we come out of the other side of this we continue to be excited about the A220s and the benefit that can bring to JetBlue,"" JetBlue chief financial officer Steve Priest told analysts and investors on May 7. ""The economics of this aircraft are spectacular.""

The coronavirus crisis has prompted something of a reckoning at airlines. For years fleet planners pushed for larger and more efficient narrow-body models that could fly, for example, transcontinental routes in the U.S. with a full load of passengers. Airbus and Boeing delivered hundreds of their largest narrow-body models, the Airbus A321 and 737-900ER respectively, to airlines across the world.

Then the spread of COVID-19 and fear of the virus halted most air travel in just a few months. Globally, the number of flights was down 81% year-over-year on May 5, according to flight-data firm Cirium. In a slight positive note, the number of flights was up 19% compared to the week before.

More than half of the global A220 fleet was tracked flying during the week ending May 4, the data shows. This is a higher percentage than for either the A320 family, 737 family or Embraer E-Jet family.

""Airlines want jets that offer equivalent range and equal or better economics than bigger models, but fewer seats,"" Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia told TPG. ""The A220 is one of the very few products that bring this to the table.""

The A220-300 can fly as far as the A320, about 3,855 miles, but more efficiently and with fewer passengers. The A220 is lighter than the legacy Airbus narrow-body and benefits from the latest generation of engines.

Those advantages play out in the decisions airlines are making during the pandemic.

For example, Delta Air Lines is parking all 62 of its A320s but still flying its 31 A220-100s. The Atlanta-based carrier fits 109 seats on the latter jets compared to 157 seats on the former. In addition, the smallest A220s can fly nearly 100 miles further than the A320s.

More A220s may also be good for passengers. The aircraft are quieter than most larger jets and, in many cases, offer a better onboard experience than comparably sized planes. In the U.S., Delta has even installed seat-back inflight entertainment where most other carriers — excluding JetBlue — have removed systems from their planes.

Even in Europe, where first class often means a blocked adjacent seat, the A220 is a comfortable option for travelers.

""The 2-3 configuration, large and modern bathrooms, big windows and modern touches combine to make for a pleasant flying experience,"" wrote TPG's Zach Griff after two A220 flights on Swiss last summer.

Zurich-based Swiss operates 29 A220-100s and -300s. Many of the planes remain in the air, with the A220 operating 83% of the airline's flights in May, according to Cirium schedules.

Demand for new A220s continues apace. Air Canada maintains plans to take its full allotment of the jet this year, with 14 A220-300 deliveries still pending. The move comes as the Montreal-based carrier retires its 14 E190s and 65 more Airbus A319 and Boeing 767 jets due to the crisis.

In the U.S., New York-based JetBlue plans to take its first of 70 A220-300s by year-end, Priest said this week. The airline has accelerated A220 deliveries even as it postponed the arrival of 22 new A321neos to beyond 2022 amid broad efforts to cut expenses. The airline will configure its A220s with between 130 and 140 seats compared to 200 seats on its A321neos.

And in Europe, Latvia-based Air Baltic plans to emerge from the crisis as an all-A220 operator after retiring its last 737-300s and ATR turboprops. The airline operated 22 A220-300s and had orders for 28 more at the end of April, according to Airbus orders and deliveries data.

The jury remains out on whether the coronavirus will prove a pivotal moment for the A220. Airbus had just 529 outstanding firm orders for the aircraft — compared to 6,156 for its A320neo family — at the end of April. And the planemaker has not received any new A220 commitments since the crisis began.

Airbus continues to produce four A220s a month even as it has slowed rates for other passenger jets. However, plans to increase production are indefinitely postponed.

""As preferred as it may be to acquire aircraft to match the need of the network, with coronavirus, the airlines are no longer afforded this luxury,"" wrote The Air Current managing director of analysis Courtney Miller in a piece on May 7. Existing commitments for the A220, as well as the E-Jet-E2, are likely to be delivered and utilized. But new orders from cash-starved airlines are unlikely, he said.

Take American Airlines, for example. The messaging of its plans to retire or park five aircraft types from its mainline fleet — including its smallest, the 99-seat E190 — focuses on simplifying its fleet, not adding new optimally-sized models like the A220. In fact, the carrier is even spending money to reduce fleet complexity, moving forward with work adding seats to some A321s and 737-800s. The effort, part of American's ""Project Oasis"" updates, comes with the expectation of operational savings after the coronavirus subsides.

But fleet simplification, as American and others are undertaking in a big way, does not necessarily mean orders for new types will dry up completely. Boeing CEO David Calhoun made just such a point during the planemaker's first quarter earnings call on April 29.

""This is that moment where rationalization efforts get big,"" he said. ""And believe it or not, in some cases, it even requires that maybe new airplanes [be] ordered.""

KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistan announced Tuesday that Airbus experts have opened a probe into last week’s plane crash that killed 97 people when an Airbus A320 went down in a crowded neighborhood near the airport in the port city of Karachi.

Initial reports have said the Pakistan International Airlines jet crashed after an apparent engine failure. Pakistani aviation authorities said Tuesday they have shared their initial findings with the visiting 11-member team from the European plane maker.

The Airbus experts and engineers are also to visit the crash site, according to Abdul Hafeez, a spokesman for PIA. “We are providing all possible assistance to the technical experts of Airbus,” he said.

Only two people on board survived the crash, including Zafar Masood, a bank executive.

Flight PK-8303 took off from the eastern city of Lahore and crashed on Friday while trying to land at the Karachi airport, Civil Aviation Authority spokesman Abdul Sattar Kokhar said.

On the ground, 18 homes were damaged but no one was killed, mainly because the local residents were gathered at nearby mosques at the time, officials had said. Eight people on the ground were injured.

So far, Pakistan has handed over 41 bodies to their families, Hafeez said, adding that DNA tests were underway to identify the remains of the other victims.

The plane made failed attempts to land at the Karachi airport before the crash. Authorities found the plane's black box and have been guarding the crash site to facilitate the probe. The plane last received a government check last November. PIA’s chief engineer signed a separate certificate on April 28, confirming all maintenance had been conducted. Airbus has said the two-engine plane had logged 47,100 flight hours and 25,860 flights as of last Friday.

The crash took place days after Pakistan resumed domestic flights ahead of Eid al-Fitr holiday, which marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan. Many of the passengers aboard the flight were families returning home for the holiday.

Pakistan has been in a countrywide lockdown since mid-March because of the virus, and when flights resumed last week, every other seat was left vacant to promote social distancing. Authorities have reported over 57,700 cases of the virus, including 1,197 deaths."

The A380 has been, for most of this millennium, the passenger experience showcase, the halo product of halo products, a flying cruise liner up front (and upstairs) and what was probably the world’s most comfortable economy class experience down the back.

The A380 also served as a sign that an airline was serious about being a major player — or at least that it had ambitions to be. Those ambitions were perhaps not couched in eventual reality for some carriers that took the aircraft, however. Perhaps the best example of this is Malaysia Airlines, which went through so many iterations of trying to either divest itself of the aircraft, turn it into a sub-branded operation or some combination of both, that most people lost track.

In addition to being an astoundingly quiet and stable aircraft, inherently a #PaxEx win, the A380 was perhaps the best thing to happen to the passenger experience since the introduction of on-demand inflight entertainment.

The aircraft’s wide seats measured over 18” on almost all airlines, while the spacious main deck’s curvature provided both a sense of space and, thanks to the door spacing and associated lavatory and galley monuments that most airlines selected around them, avoided the feeling of tunnel vision generated by long cabin sections.

Upstairs, those airlines with economy mini-cabins in a 2-4-2 configuration featured side-bins for window seat passengers that were a real boon, while either 2-3-2 premium economy upstairs or 2-4-2 downstairs were more spacious than almost any other aircraft.

In premium classes too, the A380 broke boundaries. From launch customer Singapore Airlines’ first-generation suites, through Emirates’ iconic bar and first class showers to Etihad’s Residence, the story of the A380 was about the halo product that carriers used to boost their image, never mind that — for example — the other aircraft in Emirates’ fleet still don’t have the 2003 standard direct aisle access in business class, and many don’t even have the 2000 standard of fully flat beds.

Indeed, one of the strengths of the A380 was the opportunity for airlines to made interesting choices about what to do with the space outside the seat-tracks, turning what might have been wasted space into something new, something exciting, something never before seen.

At the front of the aircraft, it was the “forehead” space upstairs that Emirates used for its first class showers, that Etihad used for the Residence on one side and a first class shower on the other, that Lufthansa used for modern aviation’s only stand-up urinal, that Singapore Airlines uses for its spacious lavatory-and-changing-areas — and that many other operators squandered on little-used lounge seating areas for business class.

At the rear of the aircraft, it was a bar at the rear of the upper deck like Emirates and Korean Air, and the latter’s walk-through duty free showcase.

In the middle, it was the joint business and first class bar and lounge areas on Etihad and Qatar Airways, and it’s here in the middle that the A380 can perhaps most inspire the widebody twinjet-shaped future without the superjumbo.

Without the uniquely shaped forward and aft spaces of the A380, it’s time to look to the passenger experience supplier industry, cabin interior design engineers and airlines themselves to figure out how to bring the very best of the A380 to the new reality, which is shaped more like the 777 and A350. Is it the Collins-style convertible space? Virgin Atlantic’s Loft? Aeroflot’s bar? China Airlines’ tearoom? Or a combination of that — or something entirely new?

The aim was to equip a 100-seat regional aircraft with a hybrid-electric drive train by 2020.

The partners had first announced in May 2019 that Airbus and Siemens would end their cooperation for hybrid-electric aircraft drives ahead of schedule. In June 2019, Siemens also added that it would sell its electric aircraft business unit for electric aircraft drives to Rolls-Royce, leaving only the British company to participate in the project with Airbus.

In its current announcement, Airbus regrets the end of the E-Fan X project. However, much has been learned from it. “Airbus’ overriding goal remains unchanged: we’re fully committed to decarbonising aviation,” says Grazia Vittadini, Airbus Chief Technology Officer. “We’re steadfast in our belief that there’s no world in which the future of air travel is not a sustainable one.”

The decision to terminate the project was taken jointly with Rolls-Royce. The knowledge gained on hybrid architectures, high-voltage systems and batteries are to be further developed in the Airbus E-Aircraft System Test House. At the same time, Vittadini described hydrogen as a possibility, “equal parts a huge opportunity as it is a new challenge”. All in all, he said, E-Fan X “shattered preconceived notions of what is possible in future flight”.

However, the technology boss of Airbus does not give a concrete outlook on hybrid aircraft. “Although E-Fan X will not be flying in the sky, I firmly believe that its spirit will live on if we continue our journey towards climate-neutral flight,” says Vittadini, thus remaining rather vague.

The unclear prospects for the hybrid project have only limited connection to the Covid 19 pandemic and the drastic economic consequences for the entire aviation industry. Former CEO Tom Enders primarily saw Airbus as the driving force behind the project – the German manager expressed his confidence in developing hybrid engines for medium-sized aircraft by 2030. However, with the move of Guillaume Faury to the top of the company and the appointment of Vittadini as Chief Technology Officer, the hybrid course at Airbus has changed.

Aircraft manufacturing giant Airbus is partnering with a small Silicon Valley biotech startup to deploy ""electronic noses"" in airports and on aircraft, the Financial Times first reported.

The sensors had the initial goal of detecting explosives but Airbus is aiming to repurpose the devices to one day also detect contagious viruses such as COVID-19, the manufacturer said on Monday.



Koniku Inc developed the potentially revolutionary sensors that can be affixed to surfaces both in airport terminals and aircraft, with the Financial Times referring to them as ""jellyfish-like"" in their appearance and ability to stick to surfaces. An Airbus rendition shows the devices can be placed on overhead bins at the front of the aircraft for increased detection.

Airbus: New Mobile assembly line is 'open for business' - AL.com,"Tue, 19 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzL21vYmlsZS8yMDIwLzA1L2FpcmJ1cy1uZXctbW9iaWxlLWFzc2VtYmx5LWxpbmUtaXMtb3Blbi1mb3ItYnVzaW5lc3MuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has announced the inauguration of its new Final Assembly Line hangar in Mobile and provided an early look at the first A220 jetliner to be built within it.

Airbus said Tuesday morning that the 270,000-square-foot hangar “is officially open for business after an 18-month construction project.” The FAL is where Airbus will assemble A220s, a new model that is smaller than the A320 jets it has assembled in Mobile for several years. “With the completion of the new hangar, the Airbus production site in Alabama has now officially doubled in size,” the company said.

Airbus actually began work in its first Alabama-built A220 last summer, using a mix of existing and new facilities. That jet is due to be delivered to Delta late this year. The fuselage and wings moving through the five primary assembly stations in the new building will go to the facility’s second customer, JetBlue.

Airbus has announced that as of May 19, 2020, its Final Assembly Line hangar for A220 jetliners in Mobile is ""open for business."" The FAL is the long building in the foreground, with the older FAL for A320 jetliners behind it.

“The team is excited to start working in their new facility and to welcome a new customer. It’s a strong endorsement from JetBlue in this challenging time,” Paul Gaskell, president of A220 USA and Head of A220 Program in Mobile, said in a statement released by Airbus. “The expansion of our commercial aircraft production in Mobile to a second product line further solidifies Airbus’ standing as a truly global aircraft manufacturer, and confirms that Airbus is an important part of the American manufacturing landscape. This A220 assembly line will help satisfy the U.S. demand for the A220 aircraft.”

Tuesday’s upbeat announcement did not address the turmoil that the global COVID-19 epidemic has created for the aerospace industry, and a spokeswoman said the company was evaluating the overall impact of the current situation on production plans in Mobile.

In the short term, the process of delivering new planes to commercial airlines has slowed as those airlines have faced a massive drop in traffic. One very visible sign of this industry-wide slowdown is a row of 25 American Airlines Boeing 777s parked along a runway at Mobile’s Brookley aerospace complex, across the road from the Airbus site. Many industry observers expect it will take two or three years for air traffic, and the industries that support it, to return to pre-pandemic levels. In early May, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said the virus had driven the aerospace industry into “gravest crisis.”

However, Airbus entered the pandemic with a backlog of more than 6,000 orders for A320 aircraft. Even if a substantial portion of those were to be canceled, years of work would remain. And Airbus has said the Mobile site “remains a strategic part of Airbus’ global production network.”

By comparison with the established A320, the A220 is a new model with far fewer orders on the books. As of April 30, 113 of the jets, all built in Canada, were in service, and a backlog of 529 orders was on the books. Some recent developments may have helped its fortunes, however, such as the collapse of a planned partnership between Boeing and Brazil-based Embraer, which could mean the A220 will face less competition in its market segment.

However, it remains to be seen whether the drop in air traffic will make the smaller, more efficient A220s more attractive to airlines, or whether the shortage of cash will make them leery of adding a new jet to their fleets.

Prior to the pandemic, the Mobile facility was producing A320 jets at a rate of six per month. Projections call for the new A220 Final Assembly Line to be producing four jets per month “by the middle of the decade.”

According to Airbus, Delta has ordered 45 A220-100s and 50 of the larger A220-300s. JetBlue has ordered 70 A220-300s."

Boeing and Airbus study how coronavirus behaves during air travel - Fox Business,"Tue, 26 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tb25leS9jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy1ib2VpbmctYWlyYnVzLWpldC1haXJsaW5lctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.

Boeing Co. and Airbus SE are researching the new coronavirus’s behavior inside jetliners, part of an industry push to curb risks that have brought air traffic to a near standstill.

Their work will involve academics, engineers and medical experts who will examine new measures to prevent disease transmission on airplanes, according to the companies and people involved in their discussions.

The effort to better understand air-travel risks during the pandemic comes as airlines try to reassure nervous passengers that masks and filtered cabin air provide reliable protection from infection in flight. Global air traffic has plunged as governments closed borders and ordered would-be fliers to stay home.

Boeing said it is developing computer models that simulate the cabin environment and could ultimately inform decisions by airlines, health officials and regulators on how to prevent the virus’s spread.

“We’re taking steps to better understand any potential risks,” a spokesman said.

TRUMP CORONAVIRUS TRAVEL BAN ON BRAZIL TO TAKE EFFECT ON TUESDAY

Airbus said the plane maker is exchanging information with universities in the U.S. and other countries. Airbus engineers are also exploring other methods of reducing the spread of the virus including self-cleaning materials, a disinfectant that can last for five days and touchless devices in lavatories, the company said.

The Federal Aviation Administration has been in touch with Boeing, Airbus and experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to assess coronavirus risks for fliers and how to mitigate them, people familiar with those discussions said. FAA officials have for years sponsored research on how to measure and reduce the introduction of fuel and oil vapors in cabins, but those efforts haven’t been formally expanded to better understand how the new coronavirus behaves inside planes, one of these people said.

The CDC said its experts participated in a call with the FAA and Boeing about recommendations concerning Covid-19 and travel.

While much is known about airplane ventilation systems and how some pathogens can spread in flight, researchers said they are still learning how the new coronavirus behaves in various settings.

“There are a lot of unknowns right now,” said John Scott Meschke, a microbiologist who teaches at the University of Washington’s school of public health and has fielded questions from Boeing related to curbing the virus’s spread.

Among efforts Boeing is weighing are research grants for academics undertaking such work, people familiar with the manufacturer’s internal discussions said. Boeing has said it is researching new technologies to enhance safety, including using ultraviolet light as a disinfectant and antimicrobial coatings for frequently touched surfaces.

TSA'S CORONAVRIUS SCREENING PROCEDURES REVEALED AHEAD OF SUMMER TRAVEL

Boeing has expressed interest in a potential project at the University of Colorado, Boulder, that could determine the dosage of ultraviolet light needed to disinfect airplanes between flights, said Karl Linden, an environmental engineering professor at the university. “They want to move really quickly,” he said.

Combating the virus in flight is challenging because of commercial air travel’s incompatibility with social distancing, some experts said. While researchers broadly agree that airplanes’ frequently replaced cabin air and strong filters are effective at removing pathogens, they may not help someone sitting near an infectious passenger who is coughing.

“Social distancing is impossible in an airplane,” said Qingyan Chen, a Purdue University engineering professor who recently discussed the topic with Boeing.

Studies of previous epidemics, including SARS and avian flu, suggest that airplane passengers who sit near infectious passengers are at the highest risk. Experts said requiring passengers to wear masks should significantly reduce the risk they will spread the virus by sneezing, coughing or talking.

“If everyone’s wearing a mask, then there is very little that is getting out into the air,” said Linsey Marr, an engineering professor at Virginia Tech, whom Airbus recently contacted for information on the subject.

The CDC has said the virus appears primarily to spread person to person within about 6 feet through droplets excreted by coughing, sneezing or talking. Charles Haas, a professor of environmental engineering at Drexel University, said more research is needed to know whether airborne particles in aircraft or other indoor spaces could spread the virus beyond such a limited area.

Airlines have ramped up cleaning efforts—disinfecting bathrooms, tray tables and seats between flights. Some are distributing sanitary wipes to passengers. The CDC has said transmission through touching contaminated surfaces is a possible, though not primary, mode of infection.

The International Air Transport Association, a trade group, has collected reports of crew members who have become infected on the job but said that of 18 major carriers it surveyed recently, none reported instances of suspected transmission between passengers. The survey found three episodes of suspected in-flight transmission from passengers to crew members between January and March, and four cases in which pilots might have transmitted the disease to another pilot before, during or between flights.

Separately, Canadian public health officials didn’t find evidence of transmission after monitoring the crew and 25 travelers who had sat near an infected passenger on a January flight. Researchers in France suspect one person was infected on a February flight to that country from the Central African Republic. Another recent study tied some cases in China to in-flight transmission.

Airline executives said they are working to reduce the risk of infection in flight. U.S. carriers have started requiring masks and reshuffled boarding and deplaning procedures to minimize contact. Carriers including Southwest Airlines Co. and Delta Air Lines Inc. are leaving seats empty and capping the number of passengers on a flight. Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly said air filters and new cleaning measures have made cabins clean and safe.

“It’s never going to be perfect no matter what we do,” Mr. Kelly said in an interview. “But I think for the circumstances, it’s very well done.”

Christoph Zammert: How Airbus is helping frontline helicopter operators in the fight against COVID-19 - Airbus,"Wed, 20 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTA1LWNocmlzdG9waC16YW1tZXJ0LWhvdy1haXJidXMtaXMtaGVscGluZy1mcm9udGxpbmUtaGVsaWNvcHRlci1vcGVyYXRvcnMtaW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters' Executive Vice-President Customer Support & Services, Christoph Zammert discusses how Airbus is helping frontline helicopter operators in the fight against COVID-19.

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, I’ve been humbled and impressed by how our helicopter operators have risen to the challenge of combatting the most wide-ranging health crisis to hit our planet in modern times.

Whether emergency medical services (EMS), police, search and rescue or military organisations, they have one sole goal in mind: saving lives, every single day.

As the manufacturer of their vertical lift solutions, it is our responsibility at Airbus to provide them with the elevated levels of service required to keep their operations running, such as technical and logistics support, while supporting them in finding new solutions to protect the health of their pilots and crews. A couple weeks ago we wrote about our early initiatives on Airbus.com. And this resolute work continues.

Protecting helicopter pilots and crews

Since the beginning, we’ve been collaborating closely with EASA and the European Helicopter Association (EHA), providing our support and recommendations whenever possible. Most recently, we have put in place a dedicated team of Airbus EMS experts to provide efficient advice to customers working the front line.

We’ve also found opportunities to team up with operators, suppliers and regulators to make available protective solutions that shield pilots and crews from contamination, while eliminating or reducing the turnaround time for helicopter disinfection following transport of a COVID-19 patient. These have taken the form of patient isolation devices (PIDs), cabin/cockpit separation solutions, protective covers, and disinfectant guidelines, among others.

Helibras recently helped adapt a PID manufactured by a local supplier for the small cabin of the H125. PIDs are the most sophisticated type of protective unit available because they contain the patient environment and eliminate the need for disinfection.

For example, our subsidiary in Brazil, Helibras, recently helped adapt a PID manufactured by a local supplier for the small cabin of our intermediate single-engine H125. PIDs are the most sophisticated type of protective unit available because they contain the patient environment and eliminate the need for disinfection. The installation was tested by operators with extensive experience in EMS missions and finally authorized by Brazil’s National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC) for all helicopter types. The device is produced in accordance with international standards by a local supplier that is responsible for its approval towards health authorities.

Also of note, DRF Luftrettung has already equipped six of its light-twin H145 helicopters with the Epishuttle PID, with five more following soon. In total, the operator has transported more than 100 COVID-19 patients, mainly inter-hospital transports.

A partnership with Airbus Foundation, Fondation de l’Academie de Medicine (FAM), and operator Babcock helped support the certification of the B.R.A.V.E. Covid-19 protective units for use on H135 helicopters.

In the same vein, we’ve partnered with the Airbus Foundation, the French Fondation de l’Academie de Medicine (FAM), and operator Babcock to support the certification of the B.R.A.V.E. Covid-19 protective units spearheaded by the CHU Dijon Bourgogne and a local French company, Bache 21, for use on H135 helicopters.

This transparent cover can be installed on the upper half of a stretcher to protect the pilots and crew and reduce disinfection times, meaning more transfers and missions completed per day. Already 24 of these have been outfitted for the French SAMU, with five more on order. And we are actively working with authorities in other countries in hopes of making this solution more widely available.

Likewise, we’ve seen a greater number of customers installing cabin-cockpit separations to protect pilots from the cabin. Back in April we had already identified and communicated options available in local markets for the H135/H145 as well as the AS332/H225 fleet. Since then, new solutions have been published for the medium AS365, H155 and H175 and our light H125, BO105 and BK117. Customers now flying with such cabin-cockpit separations include Heli Austria and Poland’s Lotnicze Pogotowie Ratunkowe (Polish Medical Air Rescue).

Heli Austria has installed cabin-cockpit separations to protect pilots from the cabin.

The power of data analytics for helicopter operators

With operations stressed to the limit, helping customers better manage their fleets via data analytics is a promising new area.

During the COVID-19 crisis, we have been assisting our EMS operators in transferring their data seamlessly from their site of operations to the Airbus Helicopters data platform.

Accompanying this data transfer is our Fleet Monitoring website application, available from the AirbusWorld collaborative customer portal. This data analytics service provides overviews of flight sessions and associated usage parameters such as cycles, engines counters and events; data quality and consistency checks; and fleet airworthiness status.

For EMS customers like Hungarian Air Ambulance and HTM Helicopters, our in-house experts analyzed their data on a daily basis in the early weeks of the crisis, thereby easing their data analysis workload by 70 percent, allowing them to focus entirely on their life-saving operations. Our Flight Analyser application is at the heart of these analyses, automatically processing flight data and detecting potential incidents before they lead to potential accidents.

All of this data was available to our technical support teams, ensuring that when they received a customer query, they had the latest data at their fingertips.

There is still much more to be done, but thanks to the agile initiatives and collaboration among operators, regulators, and manufacturers, we’ve been able to take swift action in responding to our customers’ needs while putting the safety of our people and patients first. We look forward to continuing this support."

The Graphene Flagship Project: The Key Developments in Aviation - AZoM,"Thu, 21 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF6b20uY29tL2FydGljbGUuYXNweD9BcnRpY2xlSUQ9MTkyODXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Image Credit: aapsky/Shutterstock.com

The Graphene Flagship project, funded by the European Commission with a total budget of €1 billion over 10 years (2013-2023), is investigating graphene, to enhance the aviation industry.

What is the Graphene Flagship Project?

Graphene, a two-dimensional atomic crystal constructed of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, is the strongest and lightest material known so far (Kostarelos & Novoselov, 2014) .

Acknowledging its versatility, the EU Commission initiated the Graphene Flagship project (Graphene Flagship, 2020) as the first technology flagship to endorse graphene from laboratories to numerous industries.

The initiative coordinates over 145 academic and industrial research groups in 21 countries, and runs in two phases:

30 months under the 7th Framework Program with a total European Commission funding of €54 million The remaining months under the Horizon 2020 Program.

The Graphene Flagship Project and the Aviation Industry

The aviation industry is continuously looking into reducing the maintenance time or delay time on the ground while still keeping safety in the priority.

In 2018, global maintenance, repair and overhaul was valued at $69 billion, representing 9% of airline operational costs. This is expected to reach $103 billion by 2028 (IATA, 2019) .

In freezing conditions, de-icing becomes a challenging and essential safety aspect as frozen contaminants jam control surfaces, preventing them from functioning normally. De-icing fluid costs between 1,000-10,000 Euros for smaller to larger private planes (Private Fly, 2020) . The time, facilities, vehicles and personnel needed for de-icing quickly adds enormous amounts to already high operating costs.

Graphene-Based Thermoelectric Ice Protection Systems

One of the newest Spearhead projects, GICE (2020-2023), funded by the Graphene Flagship and backed by Airbus, is aiming to develop graphene-based thermoelectric ice protection systems to keep aircraft parts ice-free without affecting aerodynamic properties.

The key industrial partner Sonaca, which is the components supplier for Airbus, will collaborate to commercialize the graphene-based ice protection systems to the technology readiness level six. Successful completion of this project will provide an innovative de-icing system that is economically and environmentally beneficial for the aviation industry.

The current widely used de-icing system requires airport staff to spray the aircraft with either ethylene glycol or propylene glycol mixed with water until the contaminants are completely removed (Government of Canada, 2010) .

Graphene Is.... Aeronautics Play

Other currently investigated materials to replace this system are carbon black, carbon rovings or carbon nanotubes (Graphene-info, 2019) . However, the popularity of graphene as an electrically conductive material has initiated the exploration in this sector.

A reliable and inexpensive graphene-based ice protection system is in the development stage by many researchers (Vertuccio, De Santis, Pantani, Lafdi, & Guadagno, 2019) (Karim, et al., 2018) . The GICE project aims to further commercialize using an electrical current to convert into heat and melt the ice.

A History of Aircraft Materials

In 1903, the Wright brothers flew the first motor-operated airplane made out of aluminum, wood and steel. Since then, aircraft materials have come a long way (Thomas, 2019) . Aircraft constructed of heavier materials such as metals were designed to withstand the load of passengers and goods. Aluminum or aluminum alloy was essentially preferred due to its lightweight properties, designed for fuel-efficient technology.

In the mid-1930s, all-metal design principles were introduced, making it the primary material for the aviation industry, though the problems of corrosion and metal fatigue were discovered (Berends, Burg, & Raaij, 2011) .

During World War Two, the shortage of metals stimulated the use of plastics in some of the replaceable parts, as they showed a proven ability to withstand chemically harsh environments.

Lighter and more fuel-efficient plastics became popular as electrical insulators and some mechanical components.

High-speed aviation required high strength and thermal resistance, leading the way to advanced carbon-carbon composites, titanium-aluminum alloys, and titanium alloys reinforced with ceramic fibers.

The aviation industry began to investigate various fiber-reinforced resin matrices that use resins. These included polyester, vinyl ester and epoxy reinforced with fibers such as glass and carbon.

The modern Airbus A350 is thought to contain 52% carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) (Marsh, 2007) . Carbon composite materials consist of only 60% of the density of traditional aluminum, saving 20% weight and reducing fuel consumption.

Although using carbon composite is popular among Airbus and Boeing, the functional advantage of graphene in this industry is widely recognized and is the current focus of the aviation industry.

Graphene Materials in the Aviation Industry

Graphene can be chemically modified, making it applicable to a wide range of applications. Under the Graphene Flagship project, the world's first model aircraft 'Prospero' with graphene-skinned wings was tested and flown successfully at the Farnborough International Air Show in the UK in early 2016 (University of Central Lancashire, 2016) .

This joint venture between The University of Manchester, the University of Central Lancashire and several SMEs, including Haydale Composite Solutions, reveals a new opportunity in investigating the effects of graphene material in drag reduction, thermal management and potential lightning strike protection.

Another fascinating initiative of Graphene Flagship in cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) has evaluated the use of graphene material in space applications (Graphene Flagship, 2019) . In 2017, the consortium successfully tested graphene to enhance the efficiency of heat exchangers in gravity-free conditions to manage the temperature difference. The electrical and thermal conductivity of graphene material induces a faster flow of electrons than silicon, improving the heat transfer between the electronic units.

The Future of Graphene in the Aviation Sector

The inclusion of graphene material in the aviation industry has demonstrated the improvement of the mechanical properties while saving significant amounts of fuel, reducing maintenance time, and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions.

The Graphene Flagship Project has widely covered the rectifiable aspects of the industry in which graphene could be incorporated. So far, technological development has proved that graphene will play a huge role in making the aviation industry safer, more environmentally friendly and economically attractive in decades to come.

New Airbus production line for small jets opens in Alabama - FreightWaves,"Wed, 20 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWlnaHR3YXZlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXctYWlyYnVzLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tbGluZS1mb3Itc21hbGwtamV0cy1vcGVucy1pbi1hbGFiYW1h0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnJlaWdodHdhdmVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ldy1haXJidXMtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1saW5lLWZvci1zbWFsbC1qZXRzLW9wZW5zLWluLWFsYWJhbWEvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has more production capacity at its Mobile, Alabama, manufacturing campus for its A220 regional jet, but who will take delivery or make new orders is an open question as the airline industry struggles to generate business in the COVID era.

The European aircraft maker on Tuesday officially opened a final assembly line for the A220 and began production of the first U.S.-built A220 for JetBlue (NASDAQ: JBLU) after tugs pulled three main sections into the building.

The 270,000-square-foot hanger, which took 18 months to construct, houses five primary assembly stations where major airframe component assemblies are fused into a complete aircraft. Airbus actually began producing the twin-engine A220 in Mobile last August using space in the building where larger A320 planes are built, and new support hangers.

JetBlue is the second Airbus customer in the U.S. to have orders filled in Mobile. Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) has orders for 45 A220-100s and 50 of the larger A220-300s. The airline, to date, has received 31 A220-100 aircraft, produced in Mirabel, Quebec, according to Airbus. The -300 variant has 130 seats. The first one is expected to be delivered from the Mobile plant this year.

This year’s cohort includes 10 start-ups originating from Ghana, Morocco, Nigeria, Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa and Tanzania, all of which will have the opportunity to further develop their ideas in preparation for a virtual showcase in June. This year’s focus is on remote sensing for precision agriculture and infrastructure development.

How can remote sensing for precision agriculture help respond to food shortages? How can satellite technology ensure the sustainable development of infrastructure across Africa?

These are the key questions—in line with SDG 2 and SDG 9 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals—that start-ups in Africa were challenged to address in their #Africa4Future application. The selected applicants now form this year’s latest cohort.

Our virtual showcase in June will be the perfect moment for start-ups to show what Africa can achieve with satellite technology and support.

- François Lombard, Director of Intelligence, Airbus Defence & Space.

Over the next two months, the start-ups will have access to technical and commercial workshops—as well as mentorship opportunities with Airbus, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit German (GIZ), and CCHub experts and coaches—to push their ideas to the next level. In June, the cohort will present their work to the #Africa4Future executive committee during a virtual showcase.

“Our virtual showcase in June will be the perfect moment for start-ups to show what Africa can achieve with satellite technology and support,” says François Lombard, Director of Intelligence, Airbus Defence & Space.

Sean Wiid, UP42 Chief Product Officer, adds: “UP42 is proud to be supporting this initiative to boost innovation in Africa by providing the start-ups easy access to a wide range of Earth-observation data, analytics and infrastructure at scale.""

#Africa4Future is a joint-accelerator programme launched by Airbus BizLab and “Make-IT in Africa,” an initiative developed by GIZ, the German agency for international cooperation. It is implemented with the help of CCHub, a Nigerian start-up consultancy. In addition, UP42, a developer platform and marketplace for geospatial data and analytics, recently signed on as the programme’s technology sponsor. Since 2017, #Africa4Future has accelerated 14 start-ups in Africa.

The shortfall in meteorological input results from the reduced number of airline flights since the outbreak began, as sensor-equipped commercial aircraft normally supply much of the global data on temperature, wind speed and wind direction.

Aeolus infographic – forecasting our daily weather

The power of observation

Owned and operated by the European Space Agency (ESA), Aeolus is the first satellite capable of performing global wind-component-profile observation on a daily basis in near real-time. A demonstrator satellite, it was developed to prove that new technologies can profile the Earth’s winds to understand how wind, pressure, temperature and humidity are interconnected – enhancing climate research and weather forecasting.

Aeolus is equipped with an innovative Airbus-designed LIDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) instrument called Aladin, which uses the Doppler effect to determine wind speed.

Aladin comprises a powerful laser, a large telescope and a very sensitive receiver. It emits short, powerful pulses of ultraviolet light down into the atmosphere and measures the shifts in wavelength of the laser light scattering off molecules and particles moving in the wind.

From ‘demonstrator’ to ‘demonstrated’

In January 2020, the UK-based European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts started using wind information from the Aeolus satellite as a regular data source – something which is extremely unusual for such a new type of data source. Just weeks later as the COVID-19 pandemic drastically reduced the number of flights around the world, Aeolus was able to fill the gap as fewer measurements were coming in from airliners.

Moreover it was recently confirmed that data from Aeolus is now being distributed to forecasting services and scientific users less than three hours after collection from space.

Philippe Pham who leads activities for Earth Observation, Navigation & Science satellites, added: “That Aeolus data is now being used as part of the operational weather forecasting flow demonstrates its quality and reliability. Built as a one-off research mission, Aeolus is truly exceeding all expectations – a testament to our engineers’ skill and determination in developing this new technology. Its success also paves the way for a possible future fleet of Doppler wind LIDAR satellites in space.”

"Turkish Airlines may delay delivery of Airbus, Boeing planes - Hurriyet Daily News","Wed, 27 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh1cnJpeWV0ZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS90dXJraXNoLWFpcmxpbmVzLW1heS1kZWxheS1kZWxpdmVyeS1vZi1haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLXBsYW5lcy0xNTUxMTTSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5odXJyaXlldGRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3R1cmtpc2gtYWlybGluZXMtbWF5LWRlbGF5LWRlbGl2ZXJ5LW9mLWFpcmJ1cy1ib2VpbmctcGxhbmVzLTE1NTExNA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Turkish Airlines may delay delivery of Airbus, Boeing planes

ISTANBUL/GENEVA

Turkish Airlines, which halted its passenger flights as a result of the coronavirus crisis, may delay the delivery of some Boeing and Airbus planes, its chairman said on May 27.

Turkey’s flag carrier company had received half of its orders for 25 Boeing 787-9 planes, but the delivery of the rest could be delayed, İlker Aycı told daily Hürriyet.

The airline is in talks to take the delivery of Airbus 350-900s that are ready from an order of 25, and that it was working to delay the delivery of the rest, he said.

“We are trying to lighten the serious burdens that could arise. We are getting our narrow-body planes,” said Aycı.

On the other hand, the parent company Turkish Cargo has risen to fifth place in the world, he recalled, leaving the door open to buy new cargo planes.

Flights to resume

Turkish Airlines is planning to begin some domestic flights on June 4 and some international flights on June 10.

Aycı hinted that the flight tickets could be much more expensive in the coming period.

“Now, even the maximum price in [inter-city] bus travels is fixed to 500 Turkish Liras [$73.8]. It was determined as 450 liras [$66.4] in a one-way domestic flight in October 2019. Flying with such a price would deteriorate a company’s health,” he said.

Turkish Airlines would no longer offer free in-flight food and drinks on domestic flights and other flights shorter than two hours, according to Aycı’s remarks.

The impact of the coronavirus could last up to five years and that it would take a while to reach 2019 load factor levels, he added, regarding a practice of leaving middle seats empty as “inapplicable and unsustainable.”

“Flying with occupancy rates between 60 and 66 would seriously affect the health of a company,” said Aycı.

He also said that the company is negotiating with labor unions to lower wages of some senior employees and to maintain employment at least until the end of this year.

Airlines given $123 billion in state aid

Governments have provided airlines $123 billion to help weather the coronavirus storm, the global aviation industry said on May 26.

The International Air Transport Association warned that the sector’s debt was expected to rise to $550 billion by the end of the year - an increase of 28 percent.

While governments have in many cases come to the rescue of their countries’ embattled airlines, IATA pointed out that $67 billion of the $123 billion committed so far would have to be repaid.

The remainder of the state aid consists of wage subsidies ($34.8 billion), equity financing ($11.5 billion), and tax relief/subsidies ($9.7 billion).

“Government aid is helping to keep the industry afloat. The next challenge will be preventing airlines from sinking under the burden of debt that the aid is creating,” said IATA chief executive Alexandre de Juniac.

IATA highlighted regional disparities, saying that airlines in North America had been promised aid worth 25 percent of their 2019 revenues; in Europe, the figure was 15 percent and in the Asia-Pacific region, 10 percent.

IATA pointed to bankruptcies in Australia, Britain, Italy and Thailand where governments had not stepped in strongly enough.

“If we don’t see an improvement in conditions during the restart period”, planned from June for domestic flights and July for continental flights, “we are fearful we are going to see a number of failures on the restart”, said IATA’s chief economist Brian Pearce.

The Geneva-based IATA represents some 290 airlines comprising 82 percent of global air traffic."

However, we have resumed the publication of new flight, hotel and lounge reviews, from trips taken before the lockdown. We have also been publishing a selection of our most popular reviews from the past year. We hope this will help you choose once we're all ready to start booking trips again.

Bear in mind that for the foreseeable future, service on board will be greatly reduced to lower the risk of contamination, and that the ground experience — with lounges closed or without food and amenities — will also be very different from what was available before the pandemic.

When it comes to flying coast to coast in the U.S., there's no commercial option more exclusive than American Airlines' Flagship First. Of the airlines flying the super-premium routes between New York and Los Angeles and San Francisco, AA's the only one offering a true first-class product. Delta, United and JetBlue offer business class as their best experience, and Alaska only has recliner seats.

But is AA's first class actually the best of the transcon bunch?

After my flight, I can say that it is. Read on for more about why, and stay tuned for my full comparison of AA Flagship First, JetBlue Mint and United Polaris. (Keep in mind that we took this review flight just before lockdowns began in the U.S.; as demand dropped, American decided to temporarily park its fleet of Airbus A321Ts — the planes configured with lie-flat first class for transcon services. But as of May 7, service has resumed.)

Booking

Unless you've got deep pockets or a cushy expense account, getting your ticket is the hardest part of the transcontinental Flagship First experience.

With fares starting at around $1,500 one-way, I can't imagine how many people are actually paying for their tickets — especially when JetBlue Mint offers fares as low as $599 one-way.

Fortunately, there are a few ways to lessen the out-of-pocket cost. You could redeem miles for a first-class ticket, but award availability is notoriously hard to find. I've had some success with married-segment availability on flights from Boston to Los Angeles, connecting in New York, but it's very hard to find seats on the nonstop from New York to L.A. or San Francisco.

Your best bet is to apply an upgrade certificate to confirm a seat in first. You'll need to be ticketed in biz in order to qualify for an upgrade, but once you're there, there's plenty of availability to first (specifically, you should be looking for the ""A"" fare class). Executive Platinum members can use systemwide upgrades to confirm a bump from biz to first and non-elites can use Business Extra points or miles to move up to first.

I personally like to hold onto my systemwide upgrades for international travel, but this could be a good use... Stay tuned for tomorrow's post about whether I thought Flagship First was worth it.

AA offers what's easily the best ground experience for transcontinental flights. When flying in first, you get access to the Flagship First check-in area, lounge and dining facility. All those things combine to easily make AA the transcon champion in this aspect.

I walked to LAX (my favorite way to get there) from the Hyatt Regency airport hotel. When I got to Terminal 4, I made my way to the Flagship First check-in facility, which is accessible from the curb on the departures level between Terminals 4 and 5.

There's an agent outside guarding the door to this exclusive entrance, ready to help you with your bags.

After quickly confirming that I was indeed eligible to use this facility, I made my way inside. Both check-in counters were staffed and I had my boarding pass printed within minutes.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 Flagship First check-in 0 1 2 3

I was then escorted up the elevator to the TSA PreCheck security line. The agent didn't just drop me at the end of the line, but rather took me right to the front before bidding me farewell. What a great ending to a top-notch check-in experience.

Once through security, I made my way to the Flagship Lounge near Gate 40. This is a more exclusive and upscale lounge than the Admirals Club, and it showed.

It still was relatively crowded during my morning visit.

The LAX Flagship Lounge has three main seating areas. The main one is beside the buffet along the hallway facing the west side of Terminal 4 and Tom Bradley International Terminal.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 9 Flagship Lounge LAX seating area 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

The next two are located side by side as you enter the facility. There's a bunch of reclining chairs arranged in rows in front of a TV and then another small sitting area with a variety of seating options.

The restrooms and eight shower rooms are located along a narrow corridor just to the right of the lounge's entrance.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 Flagship Lounge LAX shower room 0 1 2

Each shower was stocked with C.O. Bigelow amenities, though it is much smaller than those in the United Polaris Lounge.

Right next to the restrooms is a hidden treasure — the quiet room. True to its name, it was very quiet, and empty throughout my entire stay in the lounge.

It isn't just the variety and design of the seating options that is a step up from the Admirals Club. The food selection is too.

The extensive buffet featured breakfast staples and some unique additions. The selection included scrambled eggs, potatoes, sausages, bacon, pancakes, egg drop soup, steel-cut oats, bacon and egg pasta, smoked salmon, bagels, pastries, muesli, charcuterie, assorted cheeses, sushi, sweet potato and kale salad, and cereals.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 9 Flagship Lounge LAX breakfast selection 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

Everything I tasted was delicious and well above average for an airport lounge. Unlike the Dallas Flagship Lounge, there weren't any create-your-own omelets here.

The drink selection is just as impressive as the food. The fridges were stocked with a bunch of refreshing options, including boxed Just Water, Perrier, Coke-branded soft drinks, craft beers and sake.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 Flagship lounge drink selection 0 1

There is also an extensive self-serve bar with top-notch spirits, including Grey Goose and Black Label.

My favorite bar wasn't the one with liquor. It was the candy bar which had massive jars filled with caramelized almonds, chocolates, fig bars, Starburst, Twizzlers and chocolate-covered pretzels.

The refreshment station had a Franke coffee machine, Coke Freestyle machine and La Colombe drip coffee.

Both biz- and first-class passengers can enter the Flagship Lounge on qualifying transcontinental flights, but only first-class passengers can use the Flagship First dining facility.

Flagship First Dining is AA's lounge-within-a-lounge concept. It offers sit-down dining with chef-inspired food and top-shelf liquor and wine.

This beautifully designed space is located all the way at the end of the Flagship Lounge next to the relaxation area. It has frosted-glass doors, and behind them sits AA's most premium lounge experience.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 5 Flagship First Dining LAX 0 1 2 3 4

Since this area was designed for dining, it's no surprise that it's mostly filled with two- and four-top tables. In addition to the tables, there's a communal high-top table and a gorgeous bar with a few barstools.

Though the dining area overlooks the ramp between Terminal 4 and 5, the bar area just overlooks the terminal.

Breakfast is served from opening at 4:30 a.m. until 11 a.m., when the menu transitions to all-day dining. I tried the ancient-grain bowl and an omelet with potatoes for breakfast, both cooked to order and delicious.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 Ancient-grain bowl 0 1

Perhaps the best-kept secret of Flagship First Dining is the Krug champagne on offer. When I ordered and they brought it, pouring a glass and then asking if I wanted to keep it on the table or not, I closed my eyes for a moment and pretended that I was flying with Singapore, not AA.

For those interested, you can find the full Flagship First Dining menus below.

With private check-in, an escort through security and access to AA's top lounge, the transcontinental Flagship First ground experience is the best of U.S. transcon flights.

Like JetBlue, American has a dedicated sub-fleet operating its premium transcontinental flights. The A321T, as AA calls the premium-heavy Airbus A321, holds just 102 passengers in a three-class configuration. That's about half the standard number of seats on an A321.

The Flagship First cabin is spread across five rows in a 1-1 configuration. These reverse-herringbone seats are essentially the same as the those in the biz cabin on the airline's long-haul, twin-aisle Boeing 777-300ER.

This private cabin is about as good as you're going to get for a transcon, short of flying in a Mint one-person closed suite. Plus, seats are pointed away from the aisle, giving you even more separation from your neighbor.

Nonetheless, solo window seats in Polaris and JetBlue Mint suites provide more privacy than the AA first-class product.

At 20 inches wide, the seat is quite spacious, especially for a narrow-body plane.

There is copious storage, including the large side table and three open shelves — one by the table and two near the footwell. The only thing missing is a dedicated storage area for shoes.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 AA A321T Flagship First storage 0 1 2

The bifold tray table slides out from just underneath the side table. It's quite large at 19.5 inches wide and 14.5 long and easily fit my 13-inch MacBook Pro.

The seat controls are located at shoulder level, close to the window. There are some preset positions, as well as fine-tuning adjustments.

The seat converts to a 78-inch-long, lie-flat bed. Plus, the aisle armrest lowers to add about six more inches of seat width to the center portion of the seat. Combined with the oversize footwell, I had no trouble napping on this flight.

Though I generally love reverse-herringbone seats, they're not all created equal. Specifically, some have particularly small footwells, like Air Canada and Bamboo Airways. In those cases, it almost always pays to select a bulkhead seat since they've got much larger footwells.

You don't need to do that on AA's A321T. Because of the spacious cabin configuration, there's about the same amount of space for your feet at each seat. I measured the footwell in Seat 5F as 21 inches wide, 18 inches deep and 12 inches high. This was large enough to even pass Brian Kelly's ""canoe test.""

Each seat has two windows. There's a reading light next to the seat controls as well as one overhead, where you'll also find an individual air nozzle.

As is standard for the Airbus A320 series, the overhead compartments are large enough for most carry-on bags. Plus, with just 102 seats on the plane, the chances you'll have to gate-check your bag are slim.

There's one standard-size lavatory in front of Row 1 outfitted with C.O. Bigelow hand soap.

I was impressed with the amenities on this roughly five-hour flight.

Waiting at my seat during boarding was a well-stocked Athletic Propulsion Labs amenity kit. It included an APL-branded eye mask, dental kit, earplugs, tissues, lip and hand balm and sanitizing towel. There was also a FlyFit vitamins and minerals supplement, the first time I've seen such a thing in an airline amenity kit.

The plastic-wrapped Casper bedding was also a nice treat for such a short flight. There was both a full-size and lumbar pillow, as well as duvet and throw blanket. This was plenty to keep me comfortable while napping and relaxing, and with all this bedding, I wouldn't hesitate to take the red-eye in the future.

Each seat features a universal AC port and USB outlet. Among the travel hacks I post on my Instagram (follow me!), is a recommendation to always travel with an international power adapter, even when flying domestically. This was especially true on this flight since my charging brick kept falling out of the port when using the standard U.S. two-prong adapter. I quickly switched to the European duckhead, and I was able to charge my devices without an issue.

The IFE was loaded with tons of content, though it was missing both live TV and a tailcam. It featured 179 movies, including 71 new releases like ""A Hidden Life"" and ""The Lion King."" There were also 109 TV shows, including full seasons of the ""Big Bang Theory,"" ""Downtown Abbey"" and ""Friends."" (You could find even more content on your personal device through the streaming Wi-Fi network.)

As a reviewer, I loved the list-view feature, which enabled me to quickly count (and browse) the movie selection.

The 15.4-inch touchscreen TV swivels out from the seat in front. It doesn't tilt up or down, making it hard to watch a show while in bed mode.

If you can't reach the TV, you can use the 3.5-inch touchscreen remote to control the big screen.

To listen to the content, AA lent each passenger a pair of Bang & Olufsen headphones. The sound quality was quite good, though I still miss the Bose QC35s that AA used to offer. But, as usual on American, the real issue was how early the headphones were collected — a full 30 minutes before landing.

Last, there was Viasat internet available for purchase on the flight. The $22 full-flight pass was reasonable and the speeds (38 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload) were impressive.

My 10 a.m. PDT departure meant that I'd be served a full lunch and a snack.

AA's been steadily rolling out its meal preorder system, so I knew exactly what to expect before my flight. When I logged into my reservation on the airline's website, I preordered my main dish to guarantee that it'd be available for me on board. I can't wait for United to roll out this feature across its network.

Waiting at my seat upon boarding was the full menu, including drink choices.

Service began promptly once we hit 10,000 feet. I was first served some warmed mixed nuts and olives with my drink of choice (water, in this case).

After the snacks, my table was set by hand. The purser then brought out my appetizer of beet tartare with edamame and pickled onions. It was a delicious taste of California cuisine.

Shortly thereafter, the flight attendant brought around a bread basket with a choice of white, wheat or pretzel roll. Though I love pretzel rolls, I didn't touch mine. Why? Because the flight attendant took the bread basket to each seat and allowed each passenger to point at their selection. Though he served the bread with tongs, I was nervous about possible contamination in light of the coronavirus pandemic. In fact, I wouldn't be shocked if bread baskets were gone forever.

I was served a butternut squash soup about five minutes after finishing my appetizer. I loved this soup, and wish that more airlines served soup on board. It reheats well and retains its flavor at high altitudes.

Almost on cue, the flight attendant brought my salad just as I was finishing my last spoonful of soup. The summer salad mix was a nice change from a traditional salad served on a plane, and included fresh orange slices and spicy roasted sunflower seeds.

The highlight of the meal was the grain-and-greens bowl with hot smoked salmon. Like the appetizer, this dish was a perfect embodiment of California cuisine. The salmon was cooked nicely and the vegetables tasted fresh.

At this point, I'd been so healthy, so decided to go all in on dessert. I tried both the signature sundae with the works and the caramel apple butter cake à la mode. Both were superb.

I then took a brief nap and woke up about 90 minutes before arrival to the smell of warm chocolate chip cookies wafting through the aisles. This meant that it was time for the prearrival snack.

First came the snack basket, which was stocked with a grain-free granola, apple crisps and potato chips. And then came the feature presentation — AA's signature warm cookies.

Though these cookies aren't nearly as good as they used to be, I couldn't turn down a warm chocolate chip cookie.

Overall, the service well exceeded my expectations for American Airlines. I recently flew Flagship First on AA's longest flight from Dallas to Hong Kong and was thoroughly disappointed with the service I received (review coming soon!).

This was the exact opposite. Though it wasn't perfect, it was darn good, especially for AA.

Service began on the ground with a predeparture beverage of choice. Though boarding was completed from door 1L, it didn't take long since the plane only carries 102 passengers. The flight attendant spent extra time introducing himself to everyone before departure, including taking meal orders.

Once in the air, hot towels were promptly distributed. The meal service was completed expeditiously, with each dish cleared just as it was finished. Likewise, all food was plated directly at the seat instead of using carts.

The lead flight attendant continued to check on first-class passengers throughout the flight and responded immediately to the call button. At the end of the flight, he handed out handwritten cards thanking each passenger for flying with AA.

There were two very minor missteps: No one asked to hang my jacket when I boarded and I had to ask for a missing fork during my meal.

The service was a massive improvement from my previous Flagship First flight, but I'm still torn about how to rate it. Why? Because I've experienced even better, more personalized service from JetBlue Mint, at a fraction of the price of the AA ticket. You'll have to wait for my comparison of these two products to read my full thoughts.

Overall Impression

All in all, AA offers the best experience for flights across the country.

And that begins on the ground with a private check-in experience and access to AA's most private lounge. In the air, the 10-seat cabin continues the air of exclusivity, even if the seat isn't as good as JetBlue's. The amenities and food and beverage selection are top-notch. The real issue is how hard and expensive it is for someone in the points-and-miles world to get a seat up front.

But here's the real question: Is it really that much better, for the money, than a JetBlue Mint suite or United Polaris seat? My full comparison should help answer that.

Analysis: Air France’s Airbus A380 retirement - Aviation Week,"Thu, 21 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcnBvcnRzLW5ldHdvcmtzL2FuYWx5c2lzLWFpci1mcmFuY2VzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLXJldGlyZW1lbnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air France’s fleet of Airbus A380s this week became the latest victim of the COVID-19 pandemic after the airline confirmed that its remaining nine aircraft would not be returning to service.

The SkyTeam alliance member originally planned to phase out the superjumbo by 2022, but the date has been brought forward in light of the current crisis facing the aviation industry.

Five of the A380s are owned by Air France or on finance lease, while four are on operating lease. All nine are currently in storage and will not return to scheduled service once coronavirus-related travel restrictions are lifted.

“In the context of the current COVID-19 crisis and its impact on anticipated activity levels, the Air France-KLM group announces today the definitive end of Air France Airbus A380 operations,” a statement said.

The Air France-KLM Group expects the overall impact of the phase-out to amount to a writedown of €500 million ($550 million) and will be booked in the second quarter of 2020 as a non-current cost/expenses.

Air France said its A380s would be replaced by A350s and Boeing 787s as part of a strategy to make its fleet more competitive and reduce its environmental footprint.

The carrier took delivery of its first A380 in 2009 and later added a further nine. However, the first to leave its fleet made its final flight in February this year, landing at Knock (NOC) in Ireland to be disassembled and turned into spare parts.

According to analysis of data provided by OAG Schedules Analyser, Air France offered 2.67 million A380 seats in 2019, accounting for 4.5% of its total available capacity.

https://infogram.com/air-france-seat-capacity-2019-1h7j4d80xl196nr?live

The airline was the sixth largest A380-operator in the world during the year behind Emirates Airline (31.6 million seats); Singapore Airlines (4.5 million); Lufthansa (3.2 million); Qatar Airways (3 million) and Etihad Airways (2.68 million).

https://infogram.com/a380-operators-by-capacity-in-2019-1h7k23zd57zv6xr…

In 2019, Air France operated A380 equipment on a total of 11 routes during the year, all of which originated at Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG). More than 550,000 two-way seats were deployed between CDG and New York John F Kennedy (JFK) across 1,069 flights.

CDG-Los Angeles (LAX) was the second biggest route by capacity with 375,648 seats, followed by CDG-Mexico City (MEX) on 369,456 and CDG-Shanghai Pudong (PVG) on 364,296.

https://infogram.com/air-france-a380-routes-in-2019-1h7j4d80x7996nr?live

Map of Air France's A380 routes in 2019:

Air France’s decision to withdraw its nine A380s immediately follows confirmation from Lufthansa that it will phase out six of the aircraft type. Reports suggest that the German airline is also set to announce a seventh superjumbo will be retired, shrinking its fleet from 14 to seven.

If Lufthansa does remove a seventh aircraft, almost half of Europe’s A380 fleet won’t return to the skies after the COVID-19 pandemic is over when compared with the number operating in 2019.

Last year Lufthansa had 14 A380s, British Airways had 12, Air France had 10 and Portuguese charter operator Hi Fly had one. While BA and Hi Fly’s fleet remain unchanged for now, 17 A380s are set to disappear from the fleets of Lufthansa and Air France.

"Spirit Aero Lays Off 1,400 More After Airbus, Boeing Cuts - Aviation Week","Fri, 01 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcmNyYWZ0LXByb3B1bHNpb24vc3Bpcml0LWFlcm8tbGF5cy0xNDAwLW1vcmUtYWZ0ZXItYWlyYnVzLWJvZWluZy1jdXRz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Spirit AeroSystems, the largest aerostructures provider to Airbus, Boeing and other aircraft makers, will lay off around 1,450 more workers at its Wichita headquarters campus as it struggles to match cuts to its business from its OEM customers.

“Our actions follow reduced demand from our customers, who have lowered production rates as demand for new airplanes declines due to the impact of COVID-19,” Spirit CEO and President Tom Gentile said late May 1.

According to Spirit, 700 other workers will be transferred from their current assignments to a special project to manufacture medical devices for the fight against COVID-19—indicating that potentially more workers would have been let go were it not for the new work. Spirit laid off around 3,200 workers in Kansas and Oklahoma during the first quarter after Boeing halted production of the 737 MAX in January.

Boeing was responsible for around 79% of Spirit’s revenue last year, while Airbus accounted for 16%. The MAX alone made up about 53% of pre-pandemic annual revenue. In April, both OEMs announced their large commercial aircraft monthly production rates would drop 30-40% due to the novel coronavirus and the near collapse of air travel worldwide.

Spirit said the new round of layoffs will begin May 15. Later this month, “smaller” cuts will occur at Spirit’s other U.S. sites that perform commercial aircraft work. Global sites are reviewing workforce requirements and will announce their plans in the coming weeks, according to the company. Defense-related work will not be affected.

“While we are faced with difficult decisions during this unprecedented time in our industry, we remain focused on maintaining operations to support our customers, including the critical work we do on national security programs,” Gentile said. “I remain confident in the future of the aviation industry and believe in our ability as a company to weather this pandemic and emerge stronger.”

Spirit is slated to release first-quarter earnings results—before the true effect of COVID-19 occurred—on May 6. Observers also will be listening for news about planned acquisitions Spirit formally still expects to close this year. Spirit signed deals for Bombardier’s commercial aerostructures assets and the Asco aircraft parts maker, but financial analysts have deemed both deals to be vulnerable to cancellation after Boeing walked away from Embraer’s commercial assets April 25."

Airbus Opens Second Mobile Final Assembly Line - Business Alabama,"Thu, 21 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3NhbGFiYW1hLmNvbS9haXJidXMtb3BlbnMtc2Vjb25kLW1vYmlsZS1maW5hbC1hc3NlbWJseS1saW5lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus this week opened its second final assembly line in Mobile, dedicated to production of A220-100 and A220-300 aircraft. Construction of the 270,000-square-foot hangar took 18 months and officially doubles the size of the Airbus facility in Mobile.

The aircraft company had already started producing A220 craft in the next-door FAL built for the bigger A320 production. The A220 is designed for 100 to 150 seats, while the A320 usually has 140 to 170 seats. Both are single-aisle, narrow-body planes.

In a series of five primary assembly stations, workers on the FAL unite components crafted at other Airbus sites, mostly in Europe, to create an aircraft ready for delivery to the customer.

The same day Airbus announced opening of the new FAL, it also announced that components had arrived for the first A220 destined for JetBlue Airways.

“The team is excited to start working in their new facility and to welcome a new customer. It’s a strong endorsement from JetBlue in this challenging time,” said Paul Gaskell, president of A220 USA and head of A220 program in Mobile.

“The expansion of our commercial aircraft production in Mobile to a second product line further solidifies Airbus’ standing as a truly global aircraft manufacturer and confirms that Airbus is an important part of the American manufacturing landscape. This A220 assembly line will help satisfy the U.S. demand for the A220 aircraft.”

The new FAL comes online as aircraft orders have fallen worldwide, in response to dwindling traveler numbers caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Although Airbus has been working through a series of worker furloughs and shut the Mobile facility for about three weeks to clean and reconfigure, it anticipates no production rate cut for the A220 craft."

There also emerged a video, shown in this CBS story on the crash, that shows the plane in the final crash sequence, with it flying at a very high angle of attack but also descending at a fast rate before impacting structures and bursting into flames.

According to these reports, the airliner, which was arriving in Karachi from Lahore, had partially landed gear-up on the previous attempt. The pilots somehow successfully executed a go-around despite structural damage to the plane’s low-hanging engines, a claim supported by photographic evidence that has emerged since the crash.

Apparently, because the plane was damaged by the aborted, gear-up landing attempt, the crew was unable to keep it airborne long enough to make a successful landing. The plane crashed into a densely packed neighborhood, though miraculously no one on the ground was killed. Of the 99 aboard the plane, 97 were killed in the crash. Again, somehow two passengers survived the crash.

The airline had only recently restarted operations more than a month after flights were suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic, and there were concerns about pilots returning to duty after the long layoff."

Release Date May 20, 2020 The Airbus A220 and Embraer E2 will reshape airline competition after coronavirus Purchase a PDF of this article

While the smaller size and lower costs of the A220 and E2 suggest defensive advantages, the next generation of small narrow-bodies will enable airlines a powerful offensive strategy in the recovery.

The true advantage of the small-narrowbody will not solely be its lower operating cost, but rather airlines’ ability to take market share from competitors with the aircraft.

Current large A320 and A321 order books could present an opportunity for airlines to down-gauge to the A220, triggering a new small narrow-body arms race, for which Embraer will benefit, too.

As commercial aviation begins to slowly reawaken from the lockdowns, the new rules of competition in a post-COVID-19 pandemic world have only begun to be written. Airlines will slowly become airlines again, and the success of this process will be greatly influenced by the tools at hand. Through this rebuilding of the market, a delicate balance will be sought between controlling costs to maintain solvency and positioning the airline to capture the reshaped market. This new game is one of survivability versus competitiveness – a natural conflict where one cannot exist without the other.

It is from the context of this conflict that the bright future of the small narrow-body will emerge. Airbus’s A220 and Embraer’s E2 remain uniquely positioned for an industry rebuilding itself from the bottom-up — not because of cost or size advantages, but because of what those advantages mean for an industry seeking a competitive edge.

Related: The case against the Airbus A220 and Embraer E2

Even as TAC Analysis outlined the daunting challenges facing this small narrow-body segment in the near to medium-term, the long-term prospects for this segment are impressive. Yet, the path this segment will likely take to prominence will not be typical of new aircraft programs.

The airlines first able to look toward redeploying aircraft and rebuilding networks could capture precious market share and position themselves to be the leaders in the next generation airline industry. While little to no new aircraft ordering will happen soon, it is the airlines around the world with the A220 and E2 already in their fleets that will find themselves at a distinct advantage, and their competitors who will be forced to match.

Airbus begins production of A220 aircraft - Alabama Political Reporter,"Thu, 21 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFscmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tLzIwMjAvMDUvMjEvYWlyYnVzLWJlZ2lucy1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLW9mLWEyMjAtYWlyY3JhZnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus announced on Tuesday, that it has officially begun production of A220 aircraft at its Final Assembly Line hangar in Mobile.

Paul Gaskell is the President of A220 USA and head of the A220 Program in Mobile.

“The team is excited to start working in their new facility and to welcome a new customer,” said Pres. Gaskell. It’s a strong endorsement from JetBlue in this challenging time.”

Economic developer Dr. Nicole Jones said, “Last year economic developers were in agreement that the newly constructed A220 aircraft manufacturing facility would serve as a catalyst for jobs and aerospace investment in the near future and for years to come. JetBlue’s partnership is an example of how that statement has become a reality. The announcement demonstrates Airbus’ strength in our state, our nation, and the world. We are fortunate to have Airbus in Mobile, Alabama.”

Airbus said that its workforce in Mobile has begun production of the first U.S.-built A220 for U.S. airline company JetBlue. This announcement means the 270,000-square-foot hangar, where both A220-100 and A220-300 aircraft can be assembled, is officially open for business after an 18-month construction project.

The new Final Assembly Line allows Airbus to add A220 production to its Alabama manufacturing facility, which originally only built the A320.

“The expansion of our commercial aircraft production in Mobile to a second product line further solidifies Airbus’ standing as a truly global aircraft manufacturer and confirms that Airbus is an important part of the American manufacturing landscape,” Gaskell said. “This A220 assembly line will help satisfy the U.S. demand for the A220 aircraft.”

The facility houses five primary assembly stations where major airframe component assemblies come together for a completed aircraft in a flowline process.

Airbus initially began producing A220 aircraft in Mobile in August 2019 using space in an existing A320 Final Assembly Line hangar and new support hangars. With the completion of the new Final Assembly Line hangar, the Airbus production site in Alabama has now doubled in size.

JetBlue will be the second customer served by the Mobile team, with its first U.S.-made A220 scheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter.

“The opening of Airbus’ A220 Final Assembly Line in Mobile demonstrates the company’s commitment to aircraft production in the United States, and Alabama is proud to be the home of its growing U.S. manufacturing presence,” said Alabama Commerce Secretary Greg Canfield. “This marks another significant milestone for Airbus and its Mobile production center, and we look forward to seeing many others in the future.”

The airline industry has been hit really hard by the coronavirus crisis. In January, there were 111,000 airline flights a day. By April that had dropped to just 28,000 flights a day and many of them are near empty. The number of tickets sold were off by 95 percent in April from April 2019."
"Airbus aims to ease ""COVID Combi"" temporary freighter conversions - PaxEx.Aero","Fri, 01 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vcGF4ZXguYWVyby9haXJidXMtY2FyZ28tc2VydmljZS1idWxsZXRpbi1hMzMwLWEzNTAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airlines continue to convert their passenger planes into temporary cargo carriers, seeking to eke out a bit of extra revenue while travelers are grounded. Just placing cargo on the seats is one option, but increases wear on the seats and limits the size and shape of the boxes carried. Removing the seats helps solve that problem but creates other challenges.

Weight and balance issues for the aircraft overall are very real, as are floor loading concerns in any specific area. They can all be overcome, of course, but the engineering behind that requires approval from regulators. Thus far these “COVID Combi” conversions have been performed ad hoc, with a local regulator certifying the work but unclear reciprocity for those alterations on a global scale. While IATA pushes for ICAO to improve the mutual recognition of such exceptions some companies are taking a different approach, working for more formal certifications of the alterations.

Airbus pursues Service Bulletin modifications for A330, A350

Airbus is the latest to push a formal alteration plan. The aircraft manufacturer announced on Thursday plans to develop a cargo configuration for the A330 and A350 using a Service Bulletin (“SB”) as the certification method. The manufacturer’s SB approach smooths the process, as a company spokesperson explains, “[A]irlines will no longer need to seek approval for local agencies as the solution will already be approved.” The same solution is already EASA approved today, but still requires the airline to apply to its local regulator for clearance to operate with the conversion in place. The SB obviates that last step.

While the Airbus solution uses cargo pallets for securing goods on board it will not turn the main deck into a palletized cargo operation. The doors aren’t large enough for the pallets and there’s no good way for them to move on the floor in the cabin. Instead the pallets will be semi-permanently secured to the seat track on the floor, giving an airline clear indications of where to load the cargo. Boxes are then secured to the pallets and the aircraft can be dispatched with the significantly increased capacity.

Airbus indicates that the design adds 76m3 and 7.3 tonnes to an A330 and 81m3 and 7.8 tonnes to an A350. The pallets are also rated to a 9g acceleration safety standard. The company also highlights that all the components are standard and available today commercially so the deployment time for the solution is very short.

The Airbus move follows on De Havilland’s efforts last week to offer a Service Bulletin conversion option for its DASH 8-400 type. Lufthansa Technik is also working on a Supplemental Type Certificate (“STC”) option for the A330, allowing it to be deployed more rapidly and with less regulatory action for each frame. A version of the LHT solution is already flying on four Lufthansa A330s and more are expected to be converted in the coming weeks.

Shortly after his arrival at the helm of Air France-KLM Group, CEO Benjamin Smith took the decision to retire the A380. “The current competitive environment limits the markets in which the A380 can profitably operate,” stated the group at the time, adding that “keeping this aircraft in the fleet would involve significant costs, while the aircraft programme was suspended by Airbus earlier in 2019.” By 2022, the whole fleet was supposed to be retired and in November 2019, the first superjumbo was sent back to its lessor.

However, with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that forced Air France to immobilize the nine remaining A380s and the low demand expected for the coming months, Air France-KLM decided to pull the plug early. On May 20, 2020, the group announced “the definitive end of Air France Airbus A380 operations.”

The early retirement of the A380s and their depreciation in the accounts of Air France-KLM will result in a financial impact of €500 million. The superjumbo will be replaced by new generation aircraft, including the Airbus A350 and the Boeing 787, that have yet to be delivered.

The decision should also help Air France reach its carbon objectives that condition the €7 billion in state aid that it should receive from France. The company committed itself to a 50% reduction in its CO2 emissions per passenger and per kilometer between 2005 and 2030."
Pakistan International Airlines Airbus A320 Crashes In Karachi - Aviation Week,"Fri, 22 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcmNyYWZ0LXByb3B1bHNpb24vcGFraXN0YW4taW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1haXJsaW5lcy1haXJidXMtYTMyMC1jcmFzaGVzLWthcmFjaGnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) Airbus A320 aircraft has crashed close to the airport in Karachi on May 22 en route from Lahore to Jinnah International Airport.

The airline initially said that all 99 passengers and eight crew were killed in the incident, but news reports from Pakistan later said that at least two passengers had survived.

The Airbus A320, registered AP-BLD, was operating flight PK8303 from Lahore (LHE) to Karachi (KHI).

It took off at 1:08 p.m. local time from Lahore’s Allama Iqbal International Airport for the approximately 90 min. flight.

A PIA spokesman said preliminary reports indicated that the flight had been uneventful even as late as the aircraft’s final approach, when the crew contacted air traffic control and reported everything was normal. Just short of landing, however, PIA said that the pilots reported an unspecified technical fault. Contact with the aircraft was lost shortly afterwards and the aircraft was reported to have crashed.

A recording on the LiveATC website said to be of the conversation between the flight and air traffic controllers had one of the pilots announce: “We have lost engines,” followed a few seconds later by a Mayday call.

“As per international aviation guidelines, detailed investigation [will] be conducted by [Pakistan’s] Safety Investigation Board (SIB), an independent and transparent body,” the airline said.

Aviation Week Intelligence Network Fleet Data Network shows the aircraft, msn 2274, began its operational life with China Eastern in September 2004. It was returned to lessor GECAS in October 2014 and immediately leased to PIA. An Airbus spokesman said the aircraft had logged 47,100 flight hours and 25,860 cycles as of May 20. It was powered by CFM56-5B4/P engines.

“At this point, we have no confirmed information concerning the circumstances of the accident,” the PIA spokesman added. “Airbus is providing full technical assistance to the Bureau d’Enquête et d’Analyse [BEA] of France and the Pakistani authorities in charge of the investigation. Technical support is also being provided by PIA and engine manufacturer CFM. Further updates will be provided as soon as further consolidated information is available and Airbus is authorized to release it.”

A BEA spokesman said, “We are in discussions with all stakeholders to decide whether or not we send a team to the site.”

According to PIA’s website, the airline operates a fleet of Boeing 777s, Airbus A320s and ATRs. Its A320s are mostly used on its domestic and regional routes.

Pakistan’s prime minister Imran Khan tweeted: “Shocked & saddened by the PIA crash. Am in touch with PIA CEO Arshad Malik, who has left for Karachi & with the rescue & relief teams on ground as this is the priority right now. Immediate inquiry will be instituted. Prayers & condolences go to families of the deceased.”

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in a Twitter statement wrote: “ICAO is saddened by the tragic loss of life on Pakistan International Airlines Flight 8303 and for the families and friends of victims.”

This is PIA’s second crash in four years after an ATR 42-500, operating as flight PK661, crashed Dec. 7, 2016 on a hillside near Havelian, Pakistan, killing all 48 people on board.

Following widespread flight suspensions because of the COVID-19 crisis, PIA announced a partial resumption of domestic flights from May 16, with plans to operate a limited number of flights between major cities in Pakistan: Karachi to Islamabad, Quetta, Lahore and Peshawar; Lahore to Karachi and Quetta; Islamabad to Karachi and Quetta; Peshawar to Karachi and Quetta to Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad.

In a statement, Airbus confirmed its aircraft was involved in the accident, adding, “Our thoughts are with all those affected. At this stage, Airbus has no confirmed information concerning the circumstances of the accident. In line with ICAO annex 13, Airbus is providing full technical assistance to the Bureau d’Enquête et d’Analyse of France and to the Pakistani Authorities in charge of the investigation.”"
UK nears final stage of Skynet competition - C4ISRNET,"Fri, 22 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmM0aXNybmV0LmNvbS9iYXR0bGVmaWVsZC10ZWNoL3NwYWNlLzIwMjAvMDUvMjIvdWstbmVhcnMtZmluYWwtc3RhZ2Utb2Ytc2t5bmV0LWNvbXBldGl0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON — Britain’s Ministry of Defence is about to launch the final stage of a competition to manage ground station capabilities for the armed forces Skynet satellite communications network by early June, say industry executives.

Release of the invitation to negotiate documents to several industry consortia had been expected last week. Although the date appears to have slipped a little, industry executives, who asked to not be identified, say they still expect the MoD to trigger the final stage of the competition “imminently.”

The documents are expected to be issued to selected bidders within the next two weeks. Four bidder groups are in line to be selected for the next stage of negotiations, said people with knowledge of the competition.

The ground control elements of the MoD’s existing Skynet 5 network are currently managed by Airbus Defence & Space as part of a long running private finance initiative deal with the MoD originally awarded in 2003.

Part of that deal is now coming to a close with Airbus’s hold on the ground control management of Skynet finishing in August 2022.

A one year transition period is expected to kick off in 2021, if Airbus has to handover the role to a challenger.

The new competition, for a program known as the service delivery wrap, aims to compete management of the ground control stations until a new generation of communication satellites are launched around 2028. That phase is being called the enduring capability element of the Skynet 6 program.

Together the service delivery wrap and the enduring capability competitions are the main parts of a Skynet 6 program, which is aimed at taking Britain’s satellite communications into a new era at a cost in the vicinity of £6 billion ($7.3 billion).

A new satellite, known as Skynet 6A, is being acquired from Airbus to ensure communication capabilities are not compromised ahead of the new generation of satellites becoming available later in the decade.

Negotiations on that deal have been dogged by delays.

Airbus were named preferred contractor for Skynet 6A as far back as 2017 but the full contract for that deal has yet to be signed.

The company, Britain’s biggest space contractor, has been working on long lead components of the satellite in order to stay on track. A contract for the manufacturing of long lead items and preliminary design work was signed, but not announced by the MoD and Airbus in March.

A second phase of the Skynet 6A deal covering build, test, launch and deployment is currently working its way through the MoD and wider government approvals process.

A spokesman for Airbus told Defense News “We are working on elements of 6A. We are hoping for a full contract mid-year.”

With one exception, it’s not clear who the runners might be in the final stages of the service delivery wrap competition, as the MoD has insisted all contenders sign a non-disclosure agreement preventing all communication with the media and others.

Competing teams are not even allowed to publicly acknowledge they are interested in bidding.

The exception is a team made up of service provider Serco, satellite operator Inmarsat, IT specialist CGI UK and the U.K. arm of defense giant Lockheed Martin.

It announced its teaming arrangement late last year, just ahead of the MoD bringing the shutters down with its non-disclosure order.

The four companies reinforced their bid credentials May 19, announcing they were forming a team known as Athena, after the Olympian god of war and wisdom, to bid for upcoming U.K. and overseas military and civil space capability programs.

Kevin Craven, the CEO for Serco UK & Europe, called Athena an “exciting new team that will deliver enhanced space-based technologies and services from the U.K. Athena will boost British capabilities, as well as the economy, via growth in this fast-moving, developing sector. The launch of Athena also ensures diversity and choice in the U.K. space sector for future sustainable development.”

There was no mention of Skynet 6 in the Athena announcement. It did however say that Athena will “work on a number of opportunities that leverage space-based technologies, their ground-based systems and end-to-end services as they arise, both in the U.K. and internationally.”

A spokesman for Athena declined to comment on whether they were bidding for the service delivery wrap program, but it’s clear they are a contender given the announcement of their interest last December when industry prequalification questionnaires had to be returned to the MoD.

It remains a matter of speculation for the moment who the other bidders are. Previously Airbus, Babcock, Boeing, BT and Viasat have all been unofficially linked with having an interest in the competition.

Companies Defense News tried to contact either declined to comment or didn’t return calls.

For Serco, who already provide some of the manpower for the current Airbus Skynet ground station operation, the Athena teaming is the latest in a string of announcements over the last few week that have reinforced its position as a space sector services provider here.

In short order the company has secured separate contract extensions to continue to operate and maintain key ballistic missile defense radars at Fylingdales, northern England and as part of the Skynet 5 program providing support to the U.S. Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) at Oakhanger, southern England.

The U.S. division of the company announced early April it had been awarded a deal to manage and maintain the U.S. Space Force ground-based electro-optical deep space surveillance (GEODSS) system.

Flight review: Air France A350 biz class across the Atlantic - The Points Guy,"Tue, 26 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9yZXZpZXdzL2Fpci1mcmFuY2UtYTM1MC1idXNpbmVzcy1jbGFzcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available.

Air France announced last week the immediate retirement of its Airbus A380s, which in the U.S. served New York, Atlanta, Miami, Los Angeles and San Francisco. On these routes — some of which are currently suspended due to the pandemic — Air France will now employ smaller aircraft, including the Boeing 777 and 787 and the Airbus A350. The A350 in particular features the airline's latest business-class product, which we reviewed here and found much superior to the A380's.

During the COVID-19 crisis, our team has temporarily ceased taking review trips. However, we have resumed the publication of new flight, hotel and lounge reviews, from trips taken before the lockdown. To help keep you entertained — and maybe inspire you to travel, when that will be possible — we are also republishing a selection of our most popular reviews, including the one below, which was originally published in March of this year. It has been lightly edited from the original.

Air France and I are old friends. I've flown on the airline numerous times in the last few years between the U.S. and Europe, on a few different aircraft, including the Boeing 787, Boeing 777 and Airbus A380, both in economy and business class, though not in premium economy nor in the spectacular La Premiere. (The latter won our 2019 TPG award for best long-haul first class; premium economy underwhelmed us.)

I've generally had positive experiences with the airline, except on the A380, which has now been retired — it's too large of an airplane for demand post-pandemic, and it has an older onboard product. My main gripes center on the connecting experience at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris.

Air France's A350-900 parked at Toronto Pearson International Airport (YYZ).

Air France currently has four A350-900s — the smaller of the two A350 variants — and 34 more on order. It will become a mainstay of the airline's long-haul network. The A350 has quickly become one of my favorite aircraft thanks to its whisper-quiet, spacious cabin. In North America, it began serving Toronto before the pandemic, and can now be found occasionally on the flights Air France operates to New York to maintain essential connectivity. Air France's A350s do not have first class, but their business product is entirely new. Do note however that during the pandemic the onboard and ground experiences will be very different from what was available before the crisis.

Booking

As I've found many times before, the trick to finding (relatively) great business-class fares on SkyTeam alliance carriers and many other airlines is to originate in Europe. They're often significantly cheaper than tickets that begin in the U.S. Sure enough, we found an Air France itinerary from Lisbon, Portugal, to Toronto via Paris CDG and then from New York JFK back to Lisbon via Paris for just a hair over $2,300 for all segments. Plus, I was able to earn SkyMiles and elite-qualifying miles and spending with Delta, helping me tremendously in my quest to requalify for Diamond Medallion status. (That has since become moot, because Delta has extended by one year the current elite status of all its Medallion members. However, qualifying miles from flights taken in 2020 will be rolled over to 2021.)

If you want to use miles to book similar flights, Air France's frequent-flyer program, FlyingBlue, is probably the best engine for searching SkyTeam availability and a great place to start your search. However, FlyingBlue doesn't maintain an award chart, meaning you can't count on redeeming miles at a fixed rate for flights. I did a search on the site for some nonstop flights between Paris CDG and various North American destinations including Toronto, JFK and Boston and found tickets for as little as 57,500 miles each way, with taxes and fees of around $350.

The benefit of booking through FlyingBlue is how easy it is to amass miles in the program. It's a transfer partner with all three major transferable points currencies — American Express Membership Rewards, Chase Ultimate Rewards and Citi ThankYou — so even if you don't have enough points in one account, you can combine points from the various account to acquire the Flying Blue miles necessary to book the flight you want.

If you're short on miles in your FlyingBlue account, consider signing up for a card like The Platinum Card® from American Express, which offers 100,000 Membership Rewards® Points after you spend $6,000 on purchases on the Card in your first 6 months of Card Membership.

If you have plenty of time to connect through the Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, you can have a very pleasant experience, especially if you make a point of visiting one of the newer Air France lounges. If you're in a hurry, you'll likely find yourself sprinting through the airport's maze of corridors.

I've had both experiences; this time I had a five-hour layover. This meant I could take my time navigating the maze and, more important, spend some quality time in the lounge before my transatlantic hop.

My flight from Lisbon arrived at Terminal 2F and from there I made my way to the L gates at Terminal 2E. That's the home of my favorite business-class lounge at CDG, in Terminal 2E close to the L gates, exactly where I needed to be. (Air France warns that its lounges are now closed due to the virus, except for New York and Chicago.)

This newly refreshed space is large, open, airy and beautifully appointed.

The focal point of the lounge isa space called Le Balcon: a self-serve bar surrounded by striking navy velvet booths housed in a luxurious light-wood frame and topped by an ornate, shimmering, golden ceiling installation. It's a proper setting for enjoying a beverage before a long flight, and it feels authentically French.

The rest of the lounge isn't quite as stylish as the center bar, but still beautiful.

Besides the main room, there are many nooks for relaxing, working and dining, with seating spread throughout the space.

There are several different stations set up with hot and cold food options. There was a wide variety, and everything I tried was tasty.

One of my favorite parts of this space is all of the self-serve alcohol stations -- the best being the bucket of Champagne located in back of the lounge in the ""kitchen."" There is a selection of liquor and wine for the taking as well.

There are also plenty of other amenities in this lounge that make it feel especially premium, like dedicated nap areas, showers, a sauna and, most notably, a Clarins spa. There are several standalone shower rooms that attendants clean after each use.

I did, however, manage to snag a nap room for about an hour while I waited for the 20-minute facial I'd reserved when I first arrived at the lounge.

I didn't think I would be able to relax, never mind sleep, when I saw the napping chairs, but I actually got in a solid 45-minute nap.

After I woke up, it was time for my preflight pampering. I'm not well-versed when it comes to spa treatments, so I just let the Clarins staff member decide what I needed most. In any case, the facial was relaxing and hydrating — exactly what my skin needed after a whirlwind weekend in Lisbon.

From there, I took another stroll around the lounge to see what I'd missed and stumbled upon a Detox Bar, which was stocked with teas and fruit-infused waters to help passengers prepare for long flights. This lounge clearly was designed with wellness in mind.

The Wi-Fi connection was strong, with download speeds clocking in at 2.09 Mbps and uploads at 26.36 Mbps.

After a solid four hours in the lounge, I made my way to the gate, where boarding was scheduled to begin at 1:20 p.m. The gate area was busy, but most people had a place to sit and there were power ports interspersed between the seats.

The announcement to begin preboarding was made at 1:10 p.m., with general boarding commencing with Zone 1 at exactly 1:20 p.m. Even though the boarding process began on time, we were held in the jetway for about 10 minutes before being allowed on board.

As I mentioned above, Air France's A350s have different business-class seats from the newest product that the airline has been installing on its fleet of Boeing 777s and 787s as well as its Airbus A330s.

Air France flies the A350-900 model, which it configures with 34 business seats in a 1-2-1 layout. The seats themselves are essentially the Polaris product that United has been installing throughout its long-haul fleet. A number of other airlines use a very similar seat in their business-class cabins, including El Al on the Boeing 787 and TAP Air Portugal on the A330-900neo.

This configuration allows for direct aisle access at each seat, but not all seats are equal in this cabin. Because of the staggered layout some have inherently more privacy than others; especially if you're traveling alone, it's something to consider when choosing a seat.

""A"" and ""L"" seats in even rows provide the most privacy for solo travelers, as the seat's console is located between the seat itself and the aisle. I was lucky to be able to snag 4L.

If none of those seats are available, ""C"" and ""J"" seats are solo on either side of the cabin, though they're not ""protected"" from the aisle.

And if you can't get a solo seat, ""D"" and ""H"" seats in odd rows will be the best option. Even though they're located together in the middle of the cabin, there's a good amount of separation between you and your neighbor.

Finally, if you're traveling with a companion, select ""E"" and ""F"" seats in even rows — their arrangement is conducive to inflight conversation.

Each seat measures 21 inches wide and reclines fully flat to form a bed that's 78 inches long, which is about 6 feet 6 inches. I'm sure I would have slept just fine in this seat, though I wasn't necessarily trying to sleep a lot on this daytime flight.

Since I had one of the seats protected from the aisle, it felt very private, but there's also an extendable partition that provides even more shelter from the goings-on in the cabin.

The footwell wasn't particularly capacious for the large and clunky boots I had on, but once I took them off, it felt a little roomier. Still, the footwell is definitely something you'll have to contend with on this aircraft.

The seat has plenty of storage, with an adjacent counter perfect for stowing a laptop, as well as a small cupboard where I kept my wallet, passport and AirPods.

AC and USB power is provided at each seat.

The tray table extends from under the IFE screen, and swivels so that you can get in and out of the seat more easily, even with a meal in front of you.

One feature that threw me for a loop (in the best way) is the automatic blinds on the windows. It's a classy touch that certainly appeals to the AvGeek in me. I'm surprised I wasn't asked to stop playing with the shades.

All in all, I was impressed with the business-class cabin on the A350. Even though these aircraft were originally destined for Air France's now-defunct subsidiary Joon and therefore have a different design language than the rest of AF's business-class cabins, I liked it. The predominantly gray, navy and white colors work together well to create an air of relaxed luxury.

Waiting for me at my seat were a pair of slippers, pillow, duvet and the signature coat hanger.

Air France seemingly doesn't leave amenity kits on each seat before the flight is boarded; flight attendants pass through the cabin after boarding to hand them out.

The kits were distributed a few minutes after I'd settled into my seat, and they came in a gray-suede, airline-branded pouch. I'm a little surprised Air France doesn't have a partnership with one of the many French luxury brands to supply its kits — these are by no means subpar, but it'd add yet more French flair to the whole experience.

Inside the kit were essentials like toothpaste, toothbrush, eye mask, ear plugs and moisturizers. There were extras I appreciated, too, like the shoehorn and microfiber cloth.

The inflight entertainment was impressive. The screen is large, crisp and easy to use. It was a joy to navigate the interface as if I were using my iPhone.

There were multiple camera views available, including an underbody one that was fun to look at both on the ground and in the air.

There were plenty of new movies to choose from, as well as many individual shows and series. You shouldn't be bored on Air France's A350.

Wi-Fi was a low point. I was looking forward to staying connected on this flight since it was a Monday afternoon and I had work to get done.

Air France charged 8 euros for one hour or 18 euros for a full flight of its lower-capacity connection. It was 30 euros for a full flight of its highest-capacity connection. I chose the full-flight ""Surf"" option for 18 euros. However, it took more than half the flight to get any connection beyond the free messaging option, which didn't work all too well either. Once I was able to get some sort of connection, it was painfully slow, but I eventually got a few things done.

Throughout the flight, I checked in on the moving map, which offered plenty of views for any AvGeek's viewing pleasure.

[flight_stats ticket-class=""first"" review-stat-section=""Food and Beverage"" tpg-rating=""14"" tpg-rating-max=""20"" live-tv=""0"" tailcam=""0"" headphones=""0"" meals=""2"" champagne=""Laurent-Perrier Brut"" dine-on-demand=""No"" comp-alcohol=""0"" extra-pillows=""0"" turndown-service=""0"" /]

Menus for the flight were distributed just after the amenity kits, followed by a predeparture beverage of either water, orange juice or Champagne — I took a glass of the bubbly.

Meal service got underway about 45 minutes after takeoff.

First up was a round of drinks (a glass of chardonnay and a sparkling water) along with an amuse-bouche of bergamot orange panna cotta with shrimp as well as a package of cashews and dried cranberries.

As you would expect, Air France offered a very France-forward wine selection, highlighted by the Laurent-Perrier brut Champagne it serves business-class passengers.

For the appetizer course, everyone received smoked salmon with a tarragon yogurt and grilled vegetables. I'm not the biggest fan of smoked salmon but I loved the veggies and yogurt.

There were four choices for the main course: lamb confit with olives, lemon and couscous with pistachio and bell peppers; guinea fowl in a sangria sauce with parsnip puree and pear confit with vanilla; pollock in a cilantro butter with ginger biscayne sauce, and orzo pasta with piquillo cream and Espelette chili pepper.

I probably should have tried the lamb or the pollock, but I had just come from a weekend of eating a lot of meat and even more salt cod in Portugal, so I was looking for a change of pace. Hence, I ordered the orzo, but I was underwhelmed. There wasn't a lot of flavor and I found myself wanting a snack not long after the meal was finished.

I skipped the cheese course, thinking I might ask for a cheese plate a little later into the flight, and went right for dessert. On the menu, there was one dessert listed, an ""exotic amuse-bouche,"" tarte tatin with Valrhona chestnut chocolate ganache. Under that was a post-dessert option of sorbets and fresh fruit.

I was in the mood for something refreshing, so I asked if I could just have some sorbet. The FA asked if I'd like strawberry, chocolate or vanilla, to which I replied, ""Can I have all of them?"" She chuckled and said she'd be happy to bring me all three flavors. I'm glad I asked, too, because they weren't very big. But they were a highlight in an otherwise slightly disappointing meal.

Around 90 minutes before touching down, the cabin lights were turned back on so the crew could serve the second meal, which was considered a ""light snack"" on this flight. There was only one option: a savory vegetable cake served with quinoa and citrus salad. That meal was accompanied by plain yogurt and dessert: an apricot, almond and hazelnut cake and a citrus Madeleine sponge cake.

Once again, I wasn't thrilled with the main course, but the desserts were impressive for the second time around.

I typically look forward to eating on Air France flights (especially in premium cabins), but I definitely wasn't blown away on this flight. Maybe I was having an off day, but nothing I ate — besides the desserts — was particularly memorable or satisfying.

The crew on this flight was great. I was taken care of from start to finish. Several of the crew members were clearly excited to be on board the still-new A350, so we shared that bond.

In past flights, I've found that Air France crews can sometimes be impersonally professional, but on this flight the FAs were relaxed and conversational. Meals were paced well, and my two presses of the call button were answered quickly.

Overall impression

With the retirement of the A380, Air France is still left with three different business-class seats on its long-haul fleet. Luckily, the one it chose to install on its A350s is at least on the same level as the best product found in its 777s and 787s.

I wasn't wowed by the food, but I had a great flight, mostly thanks to this modern and comfortable hard product — which contributed significantly to our score of 81/100, higher than the 79/100 average for long-haul business class.

As the airline takes delivery of more A350s over the next couple of years, I hope it will send more of them to North America — and the U.S. specifically — so American flyers can experience the latest that France's flag carrier has to offer.

The Airbus Beluga is One Strange Looking Plane (Or a Whale?) - The National Interest Online,"Sat, 02 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9idXp6L2FpcmJ1cy1iZWx1Z2Etb25lLXN0cmFuZ2UtbG9va2luZy1wbGFuZS1vci13aGFsZS0xNTAzNjHSAWJodHRwczovL25hdGlvbmFsaW50ZXJlc3Qub3JnL2Jsb2cvYnV6ei9haXJidXMtYmVsdWdhLW9uZS1zdHJhbmdlLWxvb2tpbmctcGxhbmUtb3Itd2hhbGUtMTUwMzYxP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is a truly pan-European corporation, and as such has production facilities in Spain, France, Germany, the United Kingdom—not to mention the United States, Canada, and China. Final assembly of Airbus airframes generally takes place in various centers in Europe.

Due to the decentralized nature of production, parts for Boeing airframes are shipped across Europe—a time-consuming and expensive process that was historically done by road transport, or rail when possible. Rail and road transport are not ideal—they’re slow, and expensive. In the late 1980s and 1990s, Airbus needed something big enough to transport their components by air.

Super Guppy

There was one option—the American-built Super Guppy oversize transport, built by Aero Spacelines of California. As I previously wrote, the Super Guppy was an elongated, large-domed airframe that NASA had contracted to transport bulky parts for the Apollo program and other missions from the West Coast to Florida, for final assembly at Cape Canaveral.

The Super Guppy design was based on a C-97J Turbo Stratocruiser—a Boeing design. Boeing was, and remains, Airbus’ arch-rival. But they had what Airbus needed.

The Super Guppy airframes were based on 1940s-era passenger airline airframes. By the 1980s they had started showing their age. So, Airbus decided to drop the Guppies in favor of their own design, tailored to Airbus needs.

Big Beluga

Airbus settled on the Airbus A300, a capable and proven wide-body airliner that originally debuted in the mid-1970s. Engineers got to work modifying the A300 for oversize cargo transport.

The A300’s nose and cockpit were lowered slightly to give loading crews straight-in access to the cargo bay, which cut down loading and unloading times. The other advantage to a lowered immovable cockpit is that the Beluga does not have to disconnect electrical and flight systems between loads, which greatly reduces loading and unloading time.

The top of the fuselage was expanded to twenty-five feet in diameter, giving the Beluga its customary puffy look. Loading is done through the top of the expanded section. This section opens upwards, in contrast the Super Guppies, which pivot outwards on hinges like a door.

The Beluga’s transported one of its more unusual cargo items in 1999. A Beluga flew with Eugène Delacroix’s iconic painting Liberty Leading the People, a stylized depiction of the French Revolution. The painting itself was nearly ten feet tall and twelve feet wide, and could not fit inside other commercial airliners, so the Beluga stepped in and flew it from Paris to Tokyo.

In addition to one-of-a-kind pieces of art, the Beluga has transported components for the International Space Station, large pieces of industrial machinery, and even other planes and helicopters.

Although the cargo area is temperature-controlled, it is not pressurized. It therefore cannot carry certain types of cargo, such as live animals. It is also somewhat hindered by its payload capacity—only 47 tons.

Still, as Airbus’ first oversize cargo plane the Beluga provides a crucial function—and can be seen from miles away.

10 Nerdy But Very Cool Airbus A350-1000 Facts - God Save The Points,"Tue, 05 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvZHNhdmV0aGVwb2ludHMuY29tLzEwLWNvb2wtZmFjdHMtZ2FtZS1jaGFuZ2luZy1uZXctYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtMTAwMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"There’s one thing for sure. Aircraft manufacturers have listened to passenger complaints.

The things you hate about planes are changing, and there’s no aircraft where that’s more true than the Airbus A350-1000. The stretched out version of the Airbus A350-900, this plane offers incredible advancements in technology and passenger experience, and a “new” feeling is instantly visible from the mood lights alone.

The Inside Walls Aren’t Curved

Planes typically make people claustrophobic. Perhaps that’s because the walls curve in on you. Creepy, indeed. This newer Airbus is designed with “vertical” side walls to allow more space to all passengers. It may only be inches, but these days they certainly count, particularly in economy!

25% Less Fuel, C02 Emissions…

Just like the rest of us, airlines love saving on gas money. The Airbus A350 consumes 25% less fuel and emits 25% less emissions than previous generations. Expect airlines to tote their planet savings environmental strides, while also occasionally maybe dropping fares. It’s good news for everyone.

The Wings Flap, Like A Bird…

Haha, ok – this isn’t totally true. But the wings do move during flight. The plane has been designed to adapt to the amount of passengers on the plane, maximizing it’s efficiency at all stages. You won’t see anything resembling a bird, but the wings really do move. Not just the flaps, either!

53% Composite, 14% Titanium…

Old planes were primarily made with aluminum, which as you may know – is not the most reliable, or heavy duty. It’s also really heavy, which reduced fuel efficiency, which made plans less sustainable. Fortunately, new generation planes such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A350 are made from stronger new composite materials, and in this case of this A350-1000 also lots of titanium.

Quietest Of Them All

Boeing may have something to say about this, but Airbus has claims that this magnificent new A350 aircraft is the quietest of them all. Airbus specifically claims this aircraft the quietest two aisle plane on the planet, which means you’ll hear less engine noise and can enjoy your movie selection without rattle or hum, unless you’re listening to U2.

1600 Hours +2500 Hours Of Testing…

For anyone with a fear of flying, know this: the Airbus A350-100 went through more than 1600 hours of flight testing on this version alone, before any passenger even set foot in it! The previous A350-900 was tested for more than 2500 hours before a single passenger set foot on it. 1600 hours is 66 entire 24 hour days of flying.

11 Airlines Who’ll Fly It…

Quite a few airlines have their hands on the Airbus A350-900, but there are many with their hands on this streched out version as well. Qatar Airways received it first, but you’ll find it on airlines including: Air Caribes, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Qatar and Virgin Atlantic.

97,000 Kilo-Pounds Of Thrust…

The newer Rolls Royce XWB engines offer an incredible amount of thrust. We don’t quite know how to compare 97,000 pounds of thrust to most other things – but we’re told it’s ridiculously powerful. It’s something like 1,000 times more powerful than a Formula One car.

Ideal Air Pressure…

Know that dry, scratchy feeling you get from most planes? This new generation airplane was made specifically with this in mind. Thanks to the stronger new materials, the plane is able to take a more comfortable air pressure, much like its Boeing 787 competitor – leaving passengers feeling far more like they’re back on the ground. You’ll notice a difference, trust us.

Longest Flight In The World…

It doesn’t presently hold the record, but it could. The Airbus A350-1000 can fly more than 8,000 Nautical Miles, which is more than enough to overtake the current longest flight in the world. That flight is 7,842 Nautical Miles, just for reference.

Ryanair to axe Lauda's Airbus leases in favour of Boeing - ch-aviation,"Wed, 13 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoLWF2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS9wb3J0YWwvbmV3cy85MDMwOC1yeWFuYWlyLXRvLWF4ZS1sYXVkYXMtYWlyYnVzLWxlYXNlcy1pbi1mYXZvdXItb2YtYm9laW5n0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ryanair Holdings is looking to cancel the leases on all of the A320-200s operated by its Lauda (Vienna) subsidiary and replace them with B737s, chief executive Michael O’Leary has told Reuters.

The Irish LCC holding's acquisition of the Austrian carrier in 2018 was touted as a diversification of its fleet which, for the greater part of its history, has been anchored around the B737. The ch-aviation fleets module shows that, inclusive of Malta Air and Buzz (Poland), Ryanair currently has 440 B737-800s plus a single B737-700, most of which are owned, with a total of 210 B737-8-200 jets on order. However, Lauda has an all-leased fleet of thirty-two A320-200s.

In March 2019, O’Leary was advocating a dual Boeing-Airbus fleet, saying he had opened negotiations with Airbus on ordering 100 A321s. As recently as February, Ryanair said it aimed to increase Lauda’s fleet to 38 Airbus A320 Family jets by summer 2020.

But he told Reuters on May 12 that “we would not initiate talks with Airbus until such time as Airbus wants to initiate talks with us. Until they need an order from Ryanair Group, frankly we are wasting our time talking to Airbus.”

Ryanair now intends to “significantly reduce the scale of the Lauda fleet” and will cancel almost all of its deliveries due from lessors over the next 12 months.

Assuming that talks with Boeing on compensation for the MAX delivery delays - and a possible new order - go to plan, Ryanair is likely to replace Lauda’s fleet with Boeing aircraft “over the next couple of years,” O’Leary explained. These talks may not conclude until the MAX returns to service, which the chief executive said would probably happen in August or September.

Meanwhile, O’Leary threatened to close Lauda’s home base in Vienna if unions there refuse to comply with wage cuts and a new labour agreement by the end of May. Ryanair’s Boeings would then replace Lauda’s Airbus aircraft."

Uncharted Territory: AirBaltic’s Airbus A220 From Back to Front - Airline Reporter,"Wed, 27 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAyMC8wNS91bmNoYXJ0ZWQtdGVycml0b3J5LWFpcmJhbHRpY3MtYWlyYnVzLWEyMjAtZnJvbS1iYWNrLXRvLWZyb250L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The advertisement on the jet bridge read “Uncharted Territory,” as an airBaltic Airbus 220-300 pulled in at Amsterdam’s Schipol Airport (AMS) in December of 2019. This was the plane that would be taking me into territory that was personally uncharted for me. First, I was flying to Vilnius (VNO), the capital of Lithuania, where I had never been. Second, it was a type of aircraft that I had never flown on before. Third, it was also on an airline that I had never flown before, airBaltic.

To Lithuania In Economy Class on airBaltic’s A220

The boarding process at AMS involved lining up by fare class purchased, as displayed by overheard monitors. I lined up in the economy line, scanned my boarding pass, and walked down the jetway, towards uncharted territory. As I boarded the plane, I was struck by how spacious the cabin felt. At 6’2″, there was plenty of space for me to stand up.

The seats were arranged in a 3-2 configuration, similar to old McDonnell Douglas models. The windows were larger than those in preceding narrow body aircraft models. This allowed enough natural light into the cabin that the overhead lighting almost made no difference. The interior was mostly a light gray with neon green accents. Between the amount of natural light and the color scheme, the cabin gave off the feeling that you were almost in a modern day office.

I made my way past the first two rows, which were in the business class cabin, to row 14. Seat 14F was on my left, the side with three seats in the row. As it is an exit row seat, my bags had to go in the overhead bin rather than beneath the seat in front of me. AirBaltic equipped their A220s with Airbus’ Airspace bins, ensuring plenty of room for everyone’s carryon luggage. I put my bags in the bin and sat down.

The seat itself was quite comfortable. I had plenty of room to stretch my legs out in front since I was sitting in an exit row. There was no wide seat back pocket at the bottom of the seat in front of me. Instead, two narrow pockets were provided. My smartphone was just barely able to fit inside them. At the top of the seat back was a hard, plastic pocket, where the safety information card was stowed. Other airlines have opted to put a seat back entertainment system there. AirBaltic, being a budget airline, did not have a seat back monitor or inflight entertainment options. There was a small monitor beneath the overhead bins at nearly every row. This monitor would serve as both a flight tracker and commercial advertisements during our flight.

A220 BONUS: The Airbus A220 – Air Canada’s New Ambassador

Another man arrived in my row and sat down in the aisle seat. A flight attendant came by and asked that we review the safety information card since we were sitting in the exit row. One thing that struck me was, that unlike in the US, I did not have to give verbal confirmation that I was “willing and able to provide,” assistance in case of an emergency. There was no one in the middle seat, and I later learned that you could pay to have an empty middle seat. I had no idea if the passenger in the aisle seat had paid to keep the middle seat empty, but I was grateful that it was.

The boarding door closed, and it was time for takeoff. We were leaving about 10 minutes behind schedule. Although it was a brief delay, the captain announced her apologies before the safety demonstration started.

As we took our position on the runway, the engines revved up for takeoff. They were noticeably quieter than other engines of similar aircraft I have flown on previously. They gave off more of a soft whirr rather than a loud whine as we began racing down the runway to get into the air.

Takeoff was smooth, and we soon reached our cruising altitude of 38,000 feet. The flight tracker on the little overhead monitors showed we’d be flying over the Netherlands, Germany, and Poland before landing at VNO. I had a window seat, but you could see nothing but clouds below.

A few minutes after the plane had leveled out at the cruising altitude, the flight tracker screen became airBaltic QVC. As a budget airline, airBaltic charges economy passengers for drinks, snacks, and meals on some flights. I was not particularly hungry, but was in desperate need of caffeine, so I paid three euros for a cup of coffee. AirBaltic serves Illy coffee on their flights. Illy is by no means my favorite brand, but it gave me the boost that I needed.

As I sipped my coffee and read my book, the flight attendants completed their cabin service. The overhead monitor kept switching from the flight tracker to the next episode of airBaltic QVC. This time, the flight attendants were pushing a cart full of watches, perfumes, and other items for sale. Most people declined to buy anything, and I went back to reading, as the clouds continued to obscure any view of Europe below.

About one hour later, we began to make our initial descent into VNO. As we dropped below the clouds, Vilnius came into view, along with small ice formations sticking to the side of the window. In the distance, some breaks in the clouds showed pools of light with an orange sky, as the sun was beginning to set early in the afternoon.

A220 BONUS: Flying on the Competition (sorta) — the Embraer E195

The landing at VNO was smooth. We taxied to the gate, and the all female crew thanked us for flying them as we deplaned. The airport at VNO is small. The baggage claim area is in an area of the airport that is below the gates but still for passengers only. As people collected their bags and walked out the automatic sliding glass doors, I could see my friend waiting for me on the other side. When my bag came out on the carousel, I collected it and walked towards her.

Fast forward a few days, and after we had explored Lithuania, it was time to return home. The first leg of the trip was from VNO to AMS, again on airBaltic. This time I had paid to upgrade to business class. I was looking forward to seeing the differences and seeing if it might be worth it. Stay tuned as I share my airBaltic Business Class experience soon.

Air France retires Airbus A380 fleet with immediate effect - International Flight Network,"Wed, 20 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlmbi5uZXdzL3Bvc3RzL2Fpci1mcmFuY2UtcmV0aXJlcy1haXJidXMtYTM4MC13aXRoLWltbWVkaWF0ZS1lZmZlY3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French flag carrier Air France has announced on Wednesday afternoon that it will retire its nine strong Airbus A380 fleet with immediate effect.

The airline’s fleet of superjumbos was initially set to be retired in 2022, but in light of the Coronavirus crisis, the Air France-KLM Group has decided that it will bring this forward. The company owns five of its A380’s with the other four on lease. Most of the fleet has been grounded since March and April, as lack of passenger demand for air travel has meant that it has not been economical to operate the type.

Air France says “the phase-out of Airbus A380 fleet fits in the Air France-KLM Group fleet simplification strategy of making the fleet more competitive, by continuing its transformation with more modern, high-performance aircraft with a significantly reduced environmental footprint.”

The airline received its first A380 in October 2009 and it’s most recent delivery was in June 2014, making the youngest aircraft in the fleet a mere six years old. Air France’s Airbus A380 fleet will be replaced by smaller long-haul aircraft, including Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the carrier says.

SAS to defer Airbus deliveries as it overhauls business plan - Flightglobal,"Thu, 28 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlybGluZXMvc2FzLXRvLWRlZmVyLWFpcmJ1cy1kZWxpdmVyaWVzLWFzLWl0LW92ZXJoYXVscy1idXNpbmVzcy1wbGFuLzEzODU4Mi5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Scandinavia’s SAS is to defer and review future Airbus deliveries and those from lessors, as part of its response to the coronavirus crisis, as it continues to pursue additional funding.

The airline is drawing up a revised business plan which aims to bring SKr4 billion ($417 million) in improvements by 2022.

But it says it will need further funding to assist the recovery, and that this requires support from the Scandinavian governments.

Sweden’s and Denmark’s government are guaranteeing a SKr3.3 billion revolving credit facility, and the carrier is trying to enlist support from the Norwegian government, which sold its shareholding in SAS two years ago.

SAS says it is also holding “intensive and constructive discussions” with selected stakeholders on the recapitalisation scheme.

“This includes realisation of its key business priorities of necessary increased productivity and a continuation of the green transition,” it says.

SAS intends to present a business plan to the market in June.

But it has already disclosed its intention to shed up to 5,000 personnel. It adds that it will be seeking productivity improvement of 15-25% in collective-bargaining agreements.

It will continue with “strict” cost-control measures, it says, with lower spending on marketing, IT development, product, and other areas.

“We plan to adapt the fleet size, through postponements and adjusted future deliveries of aircraft from Airbus and lessors until demand returns,” adds SAS chief executive Rickard Gustafson.

Over the second quarter to 30 April the company made a net loss of SKr3.47 billion, more than treble the loss in the same period last year, as revenues almost halved to SKr5.2 billion.

Its first-half net loss reached more than SKr4.3 billion.

SAS says it expects the recovery in air transport to begin with increasing domestic demand, then European, followed by intercontinental. But it believes pre-crisis levels will not return until 2022."

Airbus aims to ‘bridge the worlds of health and aviation’ - Skies Magazine,"Tue, 19 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZXNtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWhlYWx0aC1hdmlhdGlvbi_SATVodHRwczovL3NraWVzbWFnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1oZWFsdGgtYXZpYXRpb24vP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Frederick K. Larkin | May 19, 2020 Frederick K. Larkin |

Estimated reading time 6 minutes, 8 seconds.

The COVID-19 pandemic is wreaking havoc on the global aviation industry. Over the next couple of years, the airline business is expected to face bankruptcies, mergers, headcount reductions, shrinking route networks, downsized fleets, earlier than planned aircraft model retirements, debt and equity financings and government bailouts. As a result, airliner order backlogs are declining and new aircraft deliveries are expected to be limited in the near term.

Despite this nightmarish scenario, efforts are underway to prepare for a gradual return to what was deemed to be a normal state of affairs just a few months ago. The three factors that will likely determine the strength and timing of any recovery in passenger traffic are government restrictions, market demand and consumer confidence.

The reopening of borders, international and domestic, will be required in order to stimulate future bookings. Other restrictions on the free movement of citizens will have to be substantially reduced, if not outright abolished.

While technology has provided alternate forms of communications, face-to-face meetings are expected to remain a priority for many. Business travel approvals, whether on behalf of private sector or public sector employers, will be sensitive to budgets. Leisure travel, be it family, educational or tourism-related, will be subject to the state of personal finances.

Finally, consumer confidence in the safety of air travel is expected to govern the degree of public interest in flying. The thought of hiking through crowded terminal buildings and spending hours confined in close proximity to others could dampen the wanderlust of some. The cleanliness of airport facilities and aircraft will be top of mind for most travellers.

Airbus has recognized that the timely communication of relevant information will be critical in the effort to encourage regulatory authorities, assist airlines and reassure the travelling public during this global crisis. To learn more about the OEM’s new initiative called “Keep Trust in Air Travel,” Skies interviewed Jean-Brice Dumont – the airframer’s executive vice-president, Engineering.

Given that health authorities around the globe are setting policies related to human behaviour, Skies asked Dumont if the air transport industry and aircraft manufacturers have any input into the creation of coronavirus-related regulations? He responded, “We need to bridge the worlds of health and aviation. It is essential that these two authorities (health and aviation), country by country, region by region around the world, work together closely to establish the right set of solutions. To keep the focus on the health of the passengers and at the same time not being overly prescriptive. The introduction of excess requirements would create an unbearable situation for airlines and their customers.”

With respect to social distancing aboard aircraft, there has been speculation that carriers might refrain from using the middle seats in a typical six-abreast configuration. Some have even suggested that the middle seats be removed to save weight. While this might provide more space between passengers, it would significantly reduce an airline’s available seat capacity. Passenger load factor breakeven levels would shift substantially higher and any offsetting air fare increases would probably retard passenger traffic growth. Does Airbus see this transpiring? Dumont replied, “We see the risk, but we don’t believe that it makes sense. We need regulators around the world to promote a unified set of requirements and guidelines related to operating within a pandemic.”

Airbus is communicating best practices to airlines, as well. For example, before COVID-19, air crews would usually engage the ventilation system after the passengers had started to board an aircraft. Now, Airbus is recommending that the ventilation system be started prior to the boarding process. That way, the cabin air can be circulated at least twice before passengers enter the aircraft. This helps to ensure the cleanliness of the cabin environment.

Dumont believes that Airbus can influence passenger confidence. “We have to fight the opinion of some that it is easy to become contaminated aboard an aircraft. By design, it is exactly the opposite.” He explained that during flight, half the cabin air is exchanged with the outside air, while the other half is recycled internally every two to three minutes through high-efficiency particulate arrestors. Those HEPA filters capture 99.97 per cent of particulates the size of COVID-19. Furthermore, there is no longitudinal flow of the air, as it is blown down from the ceiling and then taken in at the floor. He noted that the interior of an airliner is likely more sanitary than a typical office. Of course, human behaviour is very important and Airbus is encouraging the use of masks by passengers and the courteous practice of sneezing/coughing into one’s own elbow.

This extraordinary situation will improve significantly once there is a vaccine for the virus. In the meantime, Dumont notes, “Our challenge now is to have the healthiest, most trustworthy, transportation that we can offer. This pandemic is going to be around for awhile, so we need to learn how to live with it and how to have passengers fly safely. Like the economy, aviation must restart before COVID-19 is completely over. That will be accomplished by taking lots of measures for the protection of people.”"

The Dubai-based airline, which is by far the world’s largest operator of the A380 superjumbo, grounded its entire 115-strong fleet of double-deck planes on March 25 due to travel restrictions imposed by the government in response of the COVID-19 pandemic.

A total of 46 Airbus A380’s have now been earmarked to be permanently retired and may never fly passengers ever again. The decision comes less than two weeks after Sir Tim Clark, the longtime President of Emirates declared “the A380 is over”. In an interview with Gulf newspaper The National, Sir Tim warned that the airline would be 20 – 30 per cent smaller as it emerged from the Coronavirus crisis.

Emirates became one of the worlds first A380 operators in 2008 and still has eight of the superjumbos to be delivered from the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus. The airline had already announced plans last year to slowly start retiring the aircraft after Airbus decided to close down the A380 project but the secret plans now being developed would mark a significant acceleration in that process.

Emirates’ chairman and chief executive, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum warned last week that the COVID-19 pandemic would have a “huge impact” on the airline’s financial performance for the year ahead, saying that it would “take aggressive cost management measures, and other necessary steps to safeguard our business.”

“We expect it will take 18 months at least, before travel demand returns to a semblance of normality,” Sheikh Maktoum said of the situation.

With the airline still grounded after more than eight weeks and only very limited services due to restart on May 21, sources claim Emirates is also drawing up plans to lay off around 30 per cent of its pilot and cabin crew workforce. Until now, Emirates hasn’t reported any redundancy plans unlike fellow UAE airline Etihad Airways and regional rival Qatar Airways.

The cuts, which represent the loss of around 7,500 cabin crew jobs alone, are said to be in the final stages of development and will be based on several factors. Cabin crew who could face the axe under the proposed plans include:

Any member of cabin crew over the age of 60 years old

Anyone with active disciplinary issues

High sickness levels

Poor performance records

Cabin crew are currently receiving three-quarter pay and pilots half-pay as part of efforts to reduce costs and this policy might be extended for three more months for those crew who do get to keep their jobs.

An Emirates spokesperson said in a written response that “no announcement has been made regarding mass redundancies.”

As a 100 per cent government-owned enterprise, Emirates has won support from the Crown Prince of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum who reaffirmed the government’s commitment to the embattled airline in late March. Sheikh Hamdan said the government would inject additional liquidity to keep the airline afloat, although doubts have been raised about how much spare cash Dubai actually has.

In recent days, officials have been forced to deny allegations, first reported by Reuters, that it was in talks with Abu Dhabi for a multi-billion dollar bailout. Abu Dhabi previously approved a $10 billion loan to prop up Dubai after the 2009 financial crisis.

Emirates will resume regularly scheduled passenger flights to just nine destinations on May 21 but has walked back plans to restart services to as many as 150 cities by mid-July. All flights are being operated by Boeing 777 aircraft and Sir Tim has said the future for Emirates’ fleet is the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft.

"THY may delay plane deliveries from Boeing, Airbus amid pandemic, chairman says | Daily Sabah - Daily Sabah","Wed, 27 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseXNhYmFoLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy90cmFuc3BvcnRhdGlvbi90aHktbWF5LWRlbGF5LXBsYW5lLWRlbGl2ZXJpZXMtZnJvbS1ib2VpbmctYWlyYnVzLWFtaWQtcGFuZGVtaWMtY2hhaXJtYW4tc2F5c9IBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseXNhYmFoLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy90cmFuc3BvcnRhdGlvbi90aHktbWF5LWRlbGF5LXBsYW5lLWRlbGl2ZXJpZXMtZnJvbS1ib2VpbmctYWlyYnVzLWFtaWQtcGFuZGVtaWMtY2hhaXJtYW4tc2F5cy9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"National flag carrier Turkish Airlines (THY), which halted nearly all of its passenger flights as a result of the coronavirus crisis, may delay the delivery of some Boeing and Airbus planes, its chairman was quoted as saying on Wednesday.

The carrier last week said it plans to begin some domestic flights on June 4 and some international flights on June 10 as airlines worldwide try to get planes flying again after a global travel slump.

But Turkish Airlines Chairman İlker Aycı said in an interview with Turkey’s Hürriyet newspaper that the impact of the coronavirus could last up to five years and that it would take a while to reach 2019 load-factor levels.

Turkish Airlines had received half of its order for 25 Boeing 787-9 planes, he said, adding that the delivery of the rest could be delayed.

The airline is in talks to receive some of the Airbus 350-900s that are ready from an order of 25, and that it was working to delay the delivery of the rest, he said.

To satisfy its wide-body aircraft needs, Turkish Airlines had placed firm orders for 50 new planes with an additional 10 optional units from both Boeing and Airbus in 2018.

“We are trying to lighten the serious loads that could arise. We are getting our narrow-body planes,” Aycı said.

The company, which carried more than 74 million passengers last year, had previously suspended all domestic and international flights until May 28 as a public safety measure against the pandemic.

Aycı said Turkish Airlines would no longer offer free in-flight food and drinks on domestic flights or other flights shorter than two hours. As part of measures, carry-on bags will not be allowed in the cabin area on flights but will now be checked with other baggage. The usual 8-kilogram (17-pound) carry-on bags for international and domestic flights will be added to passengers' luggage allowance. Handbags will be permitted on flights.

Aycı also repeated that the company would try to maintain employment, but that salaries would have to be adjusted, with the aim of supporting those paid the least.

Earlier this week, he said the carrier aims to “protect employment” until the end of 2021. “Our job is to resist layoffs as much as we can,” he noted.

The number of passengers THY carried in the January-March period declined by 20% to 13.4 million, down from 16.7 million in the same period of 2019 due to the pandemic measures.

Aviation is among the industries hardest hit by the pandemic, which has struck 188 countries and regions and infected over 5.6 million people and killed more than 350,700 people worldwide since emerging in China last December. Turkey has recorded 158,762 cases and reported nearly 4,400 fatalities as of Tuesday."

While all 10 of Etihad's A380s are currently grounded due to the ongoing coronavirus crisis, on Wednesday, Etihad quashed rumours that it will stop flying the superjumbo.

""The Airbus A380 remains an important part of the Etihad fleet and is well suited to a number of key routes, which are planned to be gradually reintroduced once international restrictions are lifted, and global travel picks up"", an Etihad spokesperson told Executive Traveller.

In the same announcement, the airline expressed its commitment to the delivery of the 20 A350-1000s that it has on order.

By keeping the A380 in its fleet, Etihad is retaining its famed Residence product, which is only available on the superjumbo. The Residence is one of the most exclusive ways in the sky to travel.

In total, Etihad operates two routes to the U.K. — London Heathrow (LHR) and Manchester (MAN). The A380 only operates on the Heathrow route. In the U.S. the A380 operates the Kennedy to Abu Dhabi route.

Cash tickets to fly the Residence are often astronomical, as are the mileage costs. A one-way flight between Abu Dhabi (AUH) and London (LHR) will cost 2,198,487 Etihad Guest miles. Yes, you read that right — more than two million miles. Keep in mind that you can transfer American Express Membership Rewards points to Etihad Guest miles at a 1:1 rate.

You won't be able to use your AAdvantage miles for the $32,000 Etihad Residence Suite that TPG founder Brian Kelly himself flew in back in 2015, but they could get you an Etihad first class apartment.

Availability on Etihad's only nonstop, A380 flight from the U.S. — between New York-JFK and Abu Dhabi (AUH) — is very hard to come by in first class departing JFK, though it's a bit better from AUH. In either case, it can be a spectacular use of AAdvantage miles; you'd need just 90,000 miles each way — though unfortunately you can't book these online anymore.

As an alternative, you could book one of Etihad's other A380 flights into or out of Abu Dhabi. Currently, there are four other cities served by the superjumbo, and award rates vary:

London-Heathrow (LHR): 62,500 AA miles each way

Paris (CDG): 62,500 AA miles each way

Seoul (ICN): 50,000 AA miles each way

Sydney (SYD): 100,000 AA miles each way

Again, none of these flights are bookable on AA.com, and pay close attention to the flight you book. Many of these cities currently have multiple daily flights, and not all are operated by the A380.

Your first-class flight on a 777-300ER would still be quite comfortable — just not the full experience of Etihad's First Apartment.

Business class booked via Etihad on the A380 direct from JFK to AUH was just over $7,200 round-trip, and first class would carry an even higher price. The cash price to book the Residence from JFK to AUH on the A380? A cool $38,000.

We're seeing fewer and fewer A380s in the sky thanks to the coronavirus outbreak. Unfortunately, the A380 has been high on many airlines' list to ground because of the number of seats to fill, the cost to operate the aircraft and decreased demand. If you had a never-ending supply of Eithad miles, you could book the flight from JFK to AUH in the Residence for a cool 2,115,556 miles plus $11.50 each way. Ouch.You could also do business class for about 716,000 Etihad miles.

Long before the arrival of the coronavirus, the impending death of the mega-jet has been ongoing since February 2019 when the Airbus factory in Toulouse announced it would stop the production of the A380 entirely.

The Airbus A320, the aircraft type that came down just short of Karachi airport, is arguably the most successful airliner ever. It has a formidable safety record.

But the narrow-bodied twin-jet, which typically holds 180 passengers in an all-economy configuration, had a dreadful start to its flying career. In June 1988, a demonstration flight intended to persuade airlines around the world to buy the jet ended in tragedy when the plane struck trees at an air show.

In the 32 years between that event and the Pakistan International Airlines accident, 10 A320s have been lost in fatal crashes – along with two of its larger sibling, the A321.

The smaller A318 and A319 variants have suffered no fatal accidents.

But relative to the number of aircraft in service – almost 9,000, at least until the coronavirus pandemic grounded much of world aviation – the A320 has proved extremely safe and reliable.

Airbus narrow-bodied jets are the only short-haul aircraft used by British Airways. The A320 series is the only type flown by easyJet – which, relative to the number of passengers carried without a single fatality in an accident, is the second safest airline in the world.

In top place is Ryanair, which uses only the Boeing 737-800. This type has its origins two decades earlier than the A320, in the 1960s, and still has the same fuselage profile.

Airbus’s A320 has overtaken Boeing’s 737 in sales – largely because of the grounding of the 737 Max following two fatal accidents, involving Lion Air of Indonesia and Ethiopian Airlines.

The Max remains out of service, though Ryanair – which has its own variant of the jet on order – expects to receive its first aircraft later this year.

Because the 737 has been flying for much longer, especially in the far less safe decades of the 1970s and 80s, it has suffered many more fatal accidents.

But many in aviation regard the Airbus twin-jet as a superior aircraft. It also has a slightly wider fuselage, meaning more room for passengers.

Two of the fatal events involving the A320 series were deliberate acts – both in 2015.

In March of that year, the co-pilot of Germanwings flight 9525 from Barcelona to Dusseldorf locked the captain out of the flight deck and crashed the plane into a mountain in France. All 150 people on board died.

At the end of October 2015, Metrojet flight 9268 crashed with the loss of all 224 passengers and crew shortly after take off from Sharm el Sheikh in Egypt, destination St Petersburg. It is believed a bomb was placed on board at the departure airport.

The remarkable resilience of the A320 has been demonstrated in two other events, however. In January 2009, an Airbus flying for US Airways ditched in the Hudson River in New York after both engines failed. All 155 people on board safely evacuated in the so-called “Miracle on the Hudson”.

In February 2016, a suicide bomber attempted to destroy a Daallo Airlines flight from Mogadishu to Djibouti using a device concealed in a laptop. But the attack failed: while the fuselage was ruptured, only the bomber was ejected and the plane landed safely."
"COVID-19 Impacts Airbus, Thai Airways JV - Aviation Week","Tue, 05 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9tcm8vY292aWQtMTktaW1wYWN0cy1haXJidXMtdGhhaS1haXJ3YXlzLWp20gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In just a matter of months, the outbreak of COVID-19 has likely reshaped the commercial aviation industry for years to come. As it stands, more than half of the world’s aircraft fleet are grounded.

Some airlines previously enjoying a boom in passenger numbers have now become financially stricken entities seeking fresh capital to boost liquidity. In an aftermarket previously hitting record highs, a string of order cancellations are forecast and financial projections revised.

Aftermarket projects of scale have naturally been impacted, and this includes the continuation of some proposed OEM-MRO joint ventures—partnerships which have been one of the defining characteristics of the commercial aftermarket over the past decade.

Asia-Pacific—for the past decade the boom region for MRO activity—has also not been immune to the virus’ impact. The proposed joint venture between embattled Thai Airways and Airbus to create a maintenance facility at Thailand’s U-Tapao airport is the latest victim of the novel coronavirus pandemic with the OEM pulling its investment in the facility in late April.

Chokchai Panyayong, deputy secretary general for infrastructure of the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), the government body overseeing the industrial regeneration of the country’s eastern seaboard, confirmed Airbus had asked not to participate in the investment at a briefing last week.

The proposed partnership, first signed at the 2017 Paris Air Show, would have seen around 11 billion-baht ($335 million) worth of investment at the site in Rayong split between Thai Airways and Airbus in the campus scheduled to open in multiple phases from summer 2022.

Once built, it was expected to have capacity to maintain 80-100 aircraft per year while offering heavy maintenance and painting services, along with a line maintenance offering. However, despite not participating in its investment, Airbus will still collaborate on technology at U-Tapao, with its Skywise predictive analytics platform expected to be rolled out on site.

In March, just as the effects of COVID-19 were beginning to hit, there was speculation that the partnership was in jeopardy after the bidding process was suspended following Airbus’ failure to submit proposals. A new deadline of Apr. 20 was set with the possible scenario of opening the project to new partners should this be missed.

This is now the case and the EEC has reiterated its plan to continue with the project. With construction of the hangar in its infancy, Chokchai told Reuters that it will seek new partners for the project and even speculated Airbus could return to the fold once the novel coronavirus has subsided.

He stressed the necessity of building the site for Thai Airways, despite the carrier being in the process of restructuring. The airline’s maintenance unit has operated at U-Tapao since 1997, where it carries out heavy checks on aircraft types such as the A380 superjumbo.

The project is one of five key pillars of the Thai-government led EEC initiative, which aims to grow the industrial presence of Thailand’s eastern region. Other projects include infrastructure investments in the form of a high-speed rail link between U-Tapao and Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi and Don Mueang airports, along with an aviation campus also at U-Tapao and two seaport investments in Thailand’s eastern region."
