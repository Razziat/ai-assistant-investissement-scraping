FORT WORTH, Texas, July 23, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Taking the next step forward in creating a more modern, fuel-efficient fleet, American Airlines today welcomes its first Airbus A319 aircraft, the first of 260 planned Airbus narrowbody deliveries. American and Airbus celebrated this important milestone with a special delivery ceremony at the Airbus manufacturing facility in Hamburg, Germany.

The Airbus A319 will offer customers modern technology and increased comfort onboard, including leather seats, Wi-Fi and in-seat entertainment throughout the aircraft. In addition, customers will be able to stay connected throughout their travels with individual universal power outlets and USB jacks at every seat.

""Everything about the new A319 aircraft has been designed with the customer at the center,"" said Virasb Vahidi, American's Chief Commercial Officer. ""The introduction of the A319 is another important step in building a strong foundation for the new American. We're pleased to be partnering with Airbus.""

The Airbus A319 will offer a wide selection of inflight entertainment options for customers throughout the aircraft. First Class customers will enjoy a complimentary selection of up to 200 movies, up to 180 TV programs, more than 350 audio selections and up to 15 games, on a 12.1-inch HD-capable touchscreen monitor at each seat. Each seat throughout the Main Cabin will offer 8.9-inch HD-capable touchscreen monitors with an assortment of entertainment options, including movies, TV programs, games and audio selections.

In addition to increased technology offerings, the new Airbus aircraft pave the way for American to have a more fuel-efficient fleet, incorporating the latest in aerodynamic improvements. The A319s have sharklets on the wings and other modifications to reduce fuel burn and keep American on the path toward being a more environmentally friendly airline.

""It's our great pleasure to welcome back American Airlines to the Airbus family,"" said John Leahy, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer – Customers. ""With its introduction of the A320 Family, the airline is demonstrating its confidence in a single-aisle product that has proven to be a game-changer for airlines around the world. American is undertaking a major strategic evolution and we are pleased to watch the A320 Family becoming an integral part of the airline's future success.""

American's A319s will begin service in September from Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) to select cities, followed by additional routes throughout the end of the year. Initial routes planned for the A319 include service between DFW and Charlotte, N.C.; Cleveland; Memphis, Tenn.; and Wichita, Kan.

As previously announced, American plans to take delivery of 260 Airbus aircraft from the A320 family, including 130 current-generation aircraft from the A321 and A319 variants through 2017, and 130 A320neo aircraft with next-generation engine technology beginning in 2017. American will configure some of the current-generation A321s for use on transcontinental flights, designating these aircraft as A321Ts. The A321T is scheduled to begin service between New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), and JFK and San Francisco International Airport (SFO) in early 2014.

American's New Pimped Out Airbus A319s - View from the Wing,"Mon, 19 Aug 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9hbWVyaWNhbnMtbmV3LXBpbXBlZC1vdXItYWlyYnVzLWEzMTlzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"I had a chance to crawl around American’s new Airbus A319 in a hanger during a layover a DFW. They had the plane parked and they were doing media tours. Turns out the tours were scheduled for the afternoon I was coming through in late morning but they were happy to accommodate.

There were several planes parked, both in the old and new livery.

I actually like the new American logo, overall the paint job has grown on me and even the tail looks a lot better in person than it did in the renderings the day it was released. The planes parked side by side, viewed from the terminal, are actually quite nice. But I do find the tail to be a bit much.

I climbed on board to get a closer look at the A319.

When the seatmap for the aircraft first came out I said I was going to avoid it. That’s for one simple reason: there aren’t many first class seats so upgrades will be tough on many routes.

The plane has just 8 first class seats, compared to 16 on American’s 737s and MD80s (the latter being the plane that these new aircraft are ostensibly intended to replace). Cutting the number of first class seats in half is not conducive to complimentary upgrades, so as an elite flying I don’t want to see them scheduled. There are too many coach seats!

And while the seats themselves seem quite nice and reasonably comfortable, coach is coach with tight pitch.

But if I were confirmed in first class, or if I was going to be flying in coach regardless, this is the plane I’d want to be on in American’s domestic fleet for short and medium-distance flights. Because it’s seriously pimped out.

The exit rows and ‘main cabin extra’ are much more desirable of course.

In fact, I thought I was onboard a Delta Song aircraft (back in the day Delta’s low cost carrier provided a better coach flying experience than mainline did). Actually it was like being on a Delta plane, only brand new and with better seats.

If I can actually get into the front cabin it offers a comfortable experience.

The A319 features all leather seats even in coach, naturally it is equipped with wireless internet, and every seat has power and USB outlets. There’s a personal TV at each seat as well, with plenty of options (some complimentary, some for pay, and the pay options are free up front).

In fact, the A319 will have a more advance Gogo internet system than existing American aircraft, offering triple the bandwidth. That’s great, because internet was crawling on my flight yesterday. This should make the experience far better and give me tons more value out of my monthly Gogo membership. (American has plans to upgrade the internet speed on their existing fleet as well.)

Even the overhead bins are sleek and stylish, with a brushed metal finish on the handle.

Of course, having full sized overhead bins on each side of the aircraft will be an improvement over the MD80s these are slated to replace though it comes at the expense of having only 2 seats on one side of the aircraft in coach. On the other hand it’s a tradeoff I’m actually happy with because the Airbus A319 has an extra inch of width in each coach seat compared to a Boeing 737.

Overall the Main Cabin Extra product is one I’d be happy to fly for a couple of hours, and I’d be thrilled with being up front for a transcon flight — though if I was going to be flying this on a flight over three hours I think I’d want to confirm my upgrade in advance rather than chancing getting one of only eight seats on a complimentary basis.

The new plane that I’m really looking forward to seeing enter American’s fleet (now that the 777-300ER is becoming a mainstay) is the A321 that will fly New York JFK to Los Angeles and San Francisco. I only have to wait until January for that one!

Here are the routes that the A319 will be initially rolling out on:

September 16th: Dallas – Charlotte, Cleveland, Memphis, Wichita



October 1: Dallas – Dayton, Huntsville



October 14: Dallas – McAllen, Toronto



November 21: Dallas – Atlanta, Bogota, Corpus Christi



December 19: Dallas – Vail, Gunnison/Crested Butte, Jackson Hole



December 19: Los Angeles – Vail

The theory is to use this plane for greater frequencies than previously offered on MD80s or 737s. But I don’t ever take that at face value, deployment decisions will certainly change over time and this plane lets American throw capacity at different markets in more granular ways — both more capacity and greater frequencies as well as offering fewer seats.

Regardless, it should represent a better flying experience overall even if it also represents a much tougher upgrade for American’s elites.

Sneak Peek At New American Airlines Airbus - news9.com KWTV,"Wed, 14 Aug 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3M5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS8yMzE0MDM2My9zbmVhay1wZWVrLWF0LW5ldy1hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1haXJidXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"American Airlines has a new plane in the sky, and it's the first of it's kind for Tulsa's largest employer.

American Airlines has a new plane in the sky, and it's the first of it's kind for Tulsa's largest employer.

American Airlines is rebuilding its fleet of airplanes as it makes plans to merge and remake itself into a leaner airline.

One part of that is a new airplane. It's an Airbus A-319, the first Airbus in American's fleet and part of 460 new aircraft coming into service at the airline.

The outside sports the new American logo; the inside has leather seats with an entertainment screen on every one, with plenty to watch and WiFi.

""You could fly around the world 15 times and not repeat the same entertainment options,"" said American Design Manager Brady Byrnes.

8/13/2013 Related Story: Government's Lawsuit Against Airlines Leaves Tulsa Workers In Limbo

While the merger at American is under scrutiny by the Justice Department, the airline continues to advance towards reinventing itself with more fuel efficient airplanes.

The revamped fleet includes 777-300s and new 737s, but other than the size of the plane, the passengers shouldn't notice much difference because they'll all soon have similar interiors.

""One of the things we're really concerned about and strive for is a consistent customer experience. So the new 737 deliveries will mimic this to the greatest extent possible and for the most part will be indistinguishable between the Airbus and the Boeing fleet,"" Byrnes said.

The Tulsa Maintenance Base mostly works on Boeing aircraft now and the airline says it hasn't decided which bases will handle which elements of work for the new Airbus planes.

The airline just took delivery of the new Airbus. It starts flying passengers on routes inside the U.S. next month.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997004270553589}",neutral,0.9997004270553589,0

EAM Worldwide Outfits First Airbus Aircraft with RFID Dual-Memory Enabled Life Vests - PR Newswire,"Thu, 08 Aug 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2VhbS13b3JsZHdpZGUtb3V0Zml0cy1maXJzdC1haXJidXMtYWlyY3JhZnQtd2l0aC1yZmlkLWR1YWwtbWVtb3J5LWVuYWJsZWQtbGlmZS12ZXN0cy0yMTg4MjU4NjEuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MIAMI, Aug. 8, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- EAM Worldwide, in collaboration with EAM RFID Solutions, is responsible for outfitting the first Airbus aircraft with RFID dual-memory enabled life vests. The A320 easyJet-owned aircraft is the first plane to have dual-memory tags utilized on board.

(Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20130808/PH60950 )

In 2012, Airbus announced the requirement for all vest suppliers to comply with the dual-memory tag criteria outlined by the ATA Spec 2000 committee, the governing board of Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) for aviation. EAM Worldwide is one of the first to fulfill this requirement and will be listed as a featured vest supplier for Airbus clients.

""With the in-house know-how of our RFID division and our proprietary tag integration technique, we are able to efficiently meet the Airbus ATA dual-memory requirement with our vest products,"" states Eloy Leal, Director of EAM Operations and Engineering.

EAM Worldwide dual-memory vests now allow EAM to write the birth record (part number, serial number, date of manufacture, etc.) of each vest during the manufacturing process while creating a rewritable section, known as the lifecycle record, for end-users like easyJet. EasyJet will now have the ability to write internal data requirements into the vest tags and utilize the tags for tracking purposes like recording overhaul dates. The dual-memory tags now give easyJet the ability to detect data corruption between information that was written to the tag versus what is read by the software.

The push to convert to dual-memory tags was prompted by the deficiencies in the current vest tags, known as single-record tags. Single-record tags contain the birth record of the vest, like dual-memory tags, but are insufficient because the end-user has limited ability when attempting to modify or add additional data once it is set by the OEM.

ABOUT EAM WORLDWIDE

EAM Worldwide has delivered high-quality safety equipment and technology to help ensure the survival and well-being of each passenger and crew member for over 60 years. Products include life rafts, life vests, evacuation slides, survival and safety kits and RFID technology. EAM Worldwide is headquartered in Miami, Florida with a global sales office in Dubai, U.A.E.

ABOUT EAM RFID SOLUTIONS

RFID can be used for inventory management control, anti-theft measures or confirmation of necessary routine maintenance and inspection. RFID is also incorporated into a variety of EAM products, namely life vests.

I was already at LAX on another matter, so it made it easy for me to hop on an early flight to DFW in order to check out AA’s latest fleet addition.

It was my first opportunity to see the new livery up close and while I am admittedly not a fan of changing the tried-and-true, the composite material of many next generation aircraft that AA plans to acquire makes it necessary to move on from the polished aluminum livery. The tail still reminds me too much a mix of Transaero, Air France, and Cubana–surely AA can come up with something a bit more unique.

The aircraft had the new-car smell and was immaculate inside. Naturally.

AA frequent flyers are worried about the aircraft having only eight seats in first class, versus the 16-seat first class cabin on the MD-80s that these aircraft will be replacing. That will no doubt make upgrades harder, but the planned route utilization of these aircraft minimizes to an extent the 50% reduction in first class seats.

Look for the new aircraft on the following routes from Dallas–

Beginning September 16: Charlotte, NC, Cleveland, OH, Memphis, TN, Wichita, KS

Charlotte, NC, Cleveland, OH, Memphis, TN, Wichita, KS Beginning October 1: Dayton, OH, Lubbock, TX

Dayton, OH, Lubbock, TX Beginning October 14: El Paso, TX, Huntsville, AL, McAllen, TX, Toronto, Canada

El Paso, TX, Huntsville, AL, McAllen, TX, Toronto, Canada Beginning November 1: San Salvador, El Salvador

San Salvador, El Salvador Beginning November 21: Bogota, Colombia

Bogota, Colombia Beginning December 19: Vail, CO, Gunnison, CO, Jackson Hole, WY

The longest flight is the 2,439 mile flight from Dallas to Bogota, which is too long to fly to in coach, but I look forward to flying this aircraft on the many shorter routes this plane will be utilized on where missing an upgrade won’t hurt too much. AA hints that these aircraft will not just replace the MD-80s, but provide more frequent service, so we must wait to fully understand the ramifications of a much smaller first class cabin. The seats are comfortable, though, and with only eight seats those willing to purchase a paid ticket up front should enjoy very personalized service.

Coach is great, and I do mean that. Legroom in Main Cabin Extra is more than sufficient and even in “deep” coach Recaro’s articularting seat pan and upper literature pocket in each seat give more knee room and a more comfortable feel even when the seat in front is reclined.

Each seats featured a variety of video-on-demand, mixing some complimentary options (essentially what AA shows now on overhead screens) and some premium content, including over 200 movies. Costs start at $4 and will vary based on flight time. All options are free in first class.

In-flight power and USB hook ups are available at each seat as well, including a new and intuitive place to plug in–on the seat in front, eliminating the need to fumble under the seat cushion to find the plug.

Lastly, the aircraft will feature a much faster high-speed internet from gogo, allowing for more connectivity and higher surf speeds. With internet and seat-back IFE, even a longer flight should be tolerable, though keep in mind that internet will only be available within North America.

US Airways ripped IFE out of their aircraft and has no plans to re-introduce it on its domestic fleet, contemplating a streaming internet-based IFE option instead at some point in the future. Seeing how many now travel with iPads and laptops, that makes a lot of sense to me, but the Thales system in AA’s new A319s are really quite elegant. Assuming the merger goes through, how the two carriers will harmonize their divergent IFE philosophies is anyone’s guess right now.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999376535415649}",neutral,0.9999376535415649,0

If you can't afford the nearly $20,000 first-class ticket on board the Emirates' A380, here's the next best thing: a walk around the cabin courtesy of Google Street View.

In celebration of the fifth anniversary of the A380's launch on Emirates, the airline partnered with Google to bring the first Street View tour of an airliner, and they couldn't pick a more luxurious plane.

Since the A380's launch in 2008, it's covered 265 million kilometers over 20,000 trips and served 35 million meals, 6,314 kilos of caviar, 2,153,988 cups of coffee, 14 million bread rolls, and – mercifully – handed out over 1 million toothbrushes while shuttling over 18 million passengers on its 21-strong fleet.

When we had the chance to check out the A380 in person, we would've been content with the $1,500 ""cheap seats"" that included 500 channels served up on a 9-inch TV and the gyroscopic cup holder. And then we made the trek to first class.

Only 14 seats are available for the most well-to-do travelers, each of which enjoy twice the TV channels on a 23-inch screen, massaging seats, a seven-course meal served on custom-made china, and even hot showers with faux marble and more hair products than your local salon. And then there's the bar, fully stocked and complete with a waterfall. Exactly what you need for the 14-hour flight from JFK to Dubai.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999320387840271}",neutral,0.999320387840271,0

CNN —

For those that love the luxury of first class air travel but loathe the imposition of having to share it with others, Emirates thinks it has the aircraft for you.

The Dubai-based airline is aiming for the high-end business traveler with a new luxury private jet service. Launched this week, Emirates Executive is a bijou and bespoke version of its premium product in a dedicated Airbus A319. It can be chartered by individuals, groups or corporations through the website. Qatar Airways and Korean Air are two commercial airlines that offer a similar executive jet chartering service.

“We have seen an increasing demand in the private travel segment, especially in the Middle East and Europe as well as in markets such as India, Russia and China,” said Adnan Kazim, Emirates’ Divisional Senior Vice President for Planning, Aeropolitical & Industry Affairs.

“We are looking to tap into this niche market with the high quality of service and attention to detail.”

The Emirates Executive Airbus A319 can accommodate 19 people, with the plane divided into two main zones.

The front of the aircraft has a dining area and executive lounge designed to seat 12 people. Mechanically activated tables can be raised in front of two large sofas, while one of 1,500 channels of in-flight entertainment can be watched on two 42-inch LCD screens.

The rear of the aircraft has ten private suites – similar to the ones found in Emirates’ First Class cabins. Live TV, video conferencing facilities and high speed internet and mobile phone connectivity are also available on board.

Passengers with an appetite can have specially prepared meals served on board by Emirates crew, while a full-height shower with heated floor is available for those who need refreshment after all that exhausting pampering.

While the world’s super-rich may still be able afford their own private aircrafts, the chartering of executive jets is a growing market. It’s certainly a more affordable option than buying a large private jet outright; an Airbus ACJ318 (similar to the Emirates Executive A319) or long-range Gulfstream G650 costs around $65 million from the respective manufacturers.

While it took a big hit after the global recession that began in 2008, the private jet market is on the rise. According to forecasts by Canadian private jet manufacturer Bombardier, the industry is expected to exceed pre-2008 levels for the delivery of new jets by next year.

North America, with around 40% of the market, remains the biggest destination for private executive travel but the largest growth is expected to come from emerging regions in Latin American and Asia. Although hampered by lack of airspace and facilities, in the coming years China is expected to see a 15% increase in number of private jets flying in its skies, according to Bombardier.

The sector is worth $626 billion to manufactures like Embraer, Bombardier and Gulfstream. Boeing and Airbus produce executive iterations of their planes, including the 747 and A380.

David Velupillai, marketing director of executive and private aviation for Airbus says that their jets – from A318s to superjumbo A380s – can be fitted out according to their clients’ needs.

“We can do features which the Chinese market particularly appreciates, such as a large round table which is the focus of Asian life. We can do Karaoke bars,” he said.

UPS Airbus A300 Crashes On Approach To Birmingham-Shuttlesworth Int'l - NYCAviation,"Wed, 14 Aug 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55Y2F2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDEzLzA4L3Vwcy1haXJidXMtYTMwMC1jcmFzaGVzLW9uLWFwcHJvYWNoLXRvLWJpcm1pbmdoYW0tYWlycG9ydC8zMDEzMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"UPDATE- 8/16/13 5:45pm

The NTSB on Friday afternoon held their third press conference into the crash of UPS 1354, starting with a bit of good news. Despite considerable cosmetic damage, the flight data and cockpit voice recorders did not sustain internal damage. “The recorders did their job. We have good data from both the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder.” The voice recorder captured the entire flight, including the moments leading up to the crash. The flight data recorder contains over 400 flight parameters over 70 hours, and NTSB staff has to go through and verify to make sure they are all valid.

We now know that two minutes before the end of the recording, the aircraft was cleared to land on runway 18. 16 seconds before the end of the recording was the first of two audible alerts that are generated by the ground proximity warning system. The alert enunciated “sinkrate sinkrate,” meaning the descent of the aircraft was outside of the set parameters. At 9 seconds prior to end of recording, there are sounds that are consistent with impact.

The NTSB has also completed an interview with the air traffic controllers at Birmingham. At the time, two controllers on duty one of whom was on break. The working controller, who is apparently a very experienced controller according to the NTSB,reported that he witnessed the crash. The controller reported that he saw what appeared to be a bright spark flash, which he equated to what it would look like if a power line broke. He then reported that he observed the landing lights of the aircraft disappeared, followed by a bright orange flash and red glow. He then activated the crash phone. At no point did the controller receive a MSAW (minimum safe altitude warning) alert. This software detects if an aircraft is approaching the ground at a rate of descent that could be hazardous, and the NTSB will be investigating into why the alarm did not sound, and if it should have. The NTSB and FAA have not yet been able to conduct a flight check of the localize and PAPI lights due to a low cloud ceiling today.

The flight crew consisted two, a captain and first officer. The captain, who was flying at the time, was hired by UPS in October of 1990 and has 8,600 total flying hours with UPS, 3,200 in the Airbus A300. The first officer was hired by UPS in November 2006, had 6,500 hours total flying time, 1,250 with UPS and 400 hours in A300.

UPDATE- 8/15/13 5:45pm

The NTSB held their second press conference on Thursday evening on the investigation into the crash of UPS 1354, detailing what they have learned so far. Earlier today, the NTSB recovered the two black boxes from the burned wreckage after a three hour search. The boxes were covered in hardened plastic, metal, and cargo as a result of the crash. Although the boxes sustained considerable damage, they are “cautiously optimistic” that they will be able to obtain good data from the recorders. The two recorders are currently en route to Washington D.C. for analysis, and we should hear sometime tomorrow whether or not the data is retrievable.

Preliminary investigation so far has revealed that there is no evidence of an uncontained engine failure or pre-impact fire, however, there is evidence of ingestion of foreign debris such as dirt and wood from trees. Such ingestion is consistent with reports that the aircraft hit the tops of trees before impact, and that the engines were running during impact with the ground. Both engines will be be disassembled for further analysis.

UPS 1354 was on approach to runway 18 at Birmingham-Shuttlesworth, which is 7,099 feet long. Runway 18 is the shorter of two runways at the Birmingham, and does not have an ILS system. The longer runway 6/24, which is 11,998 feet long, was closed at the time for maintenance to the center line lights.

UPDATE- 8/15/13 1:35pm

The NTSB has issued a brief statement via Twitter that they have located and recovered the flight data and voice recorders. We expect the second press conference today at 5pm EST.

UPDATE- 8/14/13 5:35pm

On Wednesday afternoon, the National Transportation Safety Board held their first press conference detailing their investigation into the crash of the UPS A300.

“From the initial ground impact, and bear in mind that there were tree strikes prior to the ground impact, but from the initial ground impact to the final resting point of the forward fuselage which contains the cockpit area, that distance is about 200 yards. Another 75 or 80 yards past that, closer to the runway, there would be the part of the fuselage that contains the wings and the tail section, and that part of the aircraft, especially the over-wing portion was extensively damaged by fire. The tail section of the aircraft is still smoldering, still smoking.” Reports have also indicated that pieces of the aircraft have come to rest in private residences nearby the crash site.

The initial information that the NTSB has at the moment indicates that the crew did not make any type of distress call prior to the crash. The NTSB also revealed that the cockpit voice and data recorders have not yet been recovered, but that investigators are assessing the conditions of the plane and will attempt recovery as soon as they are able to do so.

ORIGINAL STORY

Reports are coming in early Wednesday morning that a UPS Airbus A300 with registration N155UP has crashed just outside Birmingham Airport, short of runway 18. Early reports have not yet mentioned a possible cause, number of crew on board, or any injuries on the ground. WVTM-TV in Alabama claims the area of the crash was once a neighborhood, but is now an open field, owned by the airport.

The crashed flight may have been UPS 1354, from Louisville Intl (KSDF) to Birmingham, a short 45 minute hop. The mayor of Birmingham has confirmed 2 fatalities as a result of the crash, the pilot and co-pilot. There were no injuries on the ground. The NTSB has launched a full go-team to the site. Birmingham Airport remains open, and flights are operating on time. NOTAMs are reporting that runway 18/36 is closed, and PAPI lights as well as the ILS system for runway 18 are down.

The mayor of Birmingham, William Bell, noted a long debris field, with the airframe broken up into several parts, and that there were no storms in the area. AL.com reports that authorities tell them that no distress calls were made to the tower prior to the crash.

The airframe was delivered to UPS in 2004, and is 9.8 years old.

Weather shortly after the crash was not significant: KBHM 140904Z 00000KT 10SM SCT010 BKN075 23/22 A2996 RMK AO2

UPS has issued the following statement:

At 6:11 a.m. EST, UPS Flight 1354 from Louisville, KY to Birmingham, AL, an A300 with two crewmembers, was involved in an accident on approach into the Birmingham airport. At this time, we have not confirmed the status of our pilots. “This incident is very unfortunate, and our thoughts and prayers are with those involved,” said UPS Airlines President Mitch Nichols. “We place the utmost value on the safety of our employees, our customers and the public. We will immediately engage with the National Transportation Safety Board’s investigation, and we will work exhaustively on response efforts,” continued Nichols. UPS will release more facts about this accident as they become available, but the NTSB will be in charge of the investigation and will be the primary source of information going forward.

Airbus has issued the following statement:

Airbus regrets to confirm that an A300-600F operated by UPS was involved in an accident shortly after 09.50hrs (UTC), at Birmingham, Alabama today. The aircraft was operating a scheduled service, Flight 1354, from Louisville, KY to Birmingham AL. The aircraft involved in the accident, registered under the number N155UP (and with ‘manufacturer serial number’ MSN841), was delivered to UPS from the production line in 2003. The aircraft had accumulated approximately 11,000 flight hours in some 6,800 flights. It was powered by Pratt & Whitney engines. At this time no further factual information is available. In line with the ICAO Annex 13 international convention, Airbus will provide full technical assistance to the French BEA as well as to the authorities who will be responsible for the accident investigation. A team of specialists from Airbus is being dispatched to Alabama. The A300-600F is a twin-engined widebody freighter aircraft. The first A300-600F entered service in 1983. At the end of June 2013, 104 A300-600Fs were in service. Airbus will make further factual information available as soon as the details have been confirmed. However, the investigation remains the entire responsibility of the relevant authorities and it would be inappropriate to speculate into the cause of the accident. The concerns and sympathies of the Airbus employees go out to the families, friends and loved ones affected by the accident of Flight 1354.

All AAccess Pass: The ”New American” Airbus A319 Unveiled at DFW - Airline Reporter,"Wed, 21 Aug 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMy8wOC9hbGwtYWFjY2Vzcy1wYXNzLXRoZS1uZXctYW1lcmljYW4tYWlyYnVzLWEzMTktdW52ZWlsZWQtYXQtZGZ3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Reported from Fort Worth by: Jack Harty, Senior Correspondent Archive.com and re-printed with permission.

The ’œNew American’ is arriving along with a new aircraft almost every week. With each delivery, American is slowly introducing a brand-new onboard product that first debuted on their Boeing 777-300ERs and continues to make its way into the fleet with the delivery of their first A319 aircraft. In February, American Airlines and US Airways announced plans to merge which would help form the ’œNew American.’

However, the Department of Justice filed a motion to stop the merger last week, citing that competition would be decreased. At this time, it’s not clear if a merger with US Airways will be part of the ’œNew American’, though many in the industry feel that the merger will happen after AA agrees to concessions, such as surrendering significant slots at Washington Reagan National Airport.

At a minimum, the merger closing will be pushed back from the 3rd to 4th quarter of 2013. Even if American and US Airways do not complete their merger, it is evident that American Airlines is going through a transformation as they build the ’œNew American.’

On August 14th, American Airlines unveiled their first A319 in the United States to employees and press; we were invited.

Since American took delivery of their first Boeing 777 in 1999, the Airbus A319 became the first completely brand new aircraft type American has taken delivery of in more than fourteen years. Their first A319 was delivered on July 23, and it was ferried to Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) via Bangor, Maine the following day. Once the A319 arrived at DFW, engineers, onboard product personnel, the FAA, mechanics, and many others have been working hard to get the aircraft ready for its first passenger flight on September 16. Airchive will be onboard the inaugural flight between DFW and Charlotte.

American Airlines placed a large order for hundreds of narrow body aircraft in July 2012 to replace its aging fleet. The Airbus A319 was ordered to directly replace their ancient, yet iconic, McDonnell Douglas Douglas Super 80 aircraft. The A321 was ordered to replace their aging Boeing 757-200 and 767-200 aircraft. The Airbus A320 was not part of the specification as the 737-800 fits this mission in the fleet. If the US/AA merger happens, American will instantly become the world’s largest operator of the Airbus A320 family.

About 26 months prior the first A319 delivery, the 24-member American Airlines Onboard Product Team began designing the interiors for their new aircraft. As Brady Byrnes, the Manager of Design for American Airlines’ Onboard Products said, ’œ[American] wanted it to be straightforward, clean, and simple. But, [American] wanted it to be sophisticated and modern at the same time.’ American’s A319s boast leather seats, inflight Wi-Fi, in-seat entertainment, and universal power outlets at every seat.

There are 8 leather First Class seats manufactured by Weber in a 2-2 configuration. The entertainment system boasts 200 movies, up to 180 TV programs, more than 350 audio selections, and 15 games. Coming later this year, customers will have the ability to chat with passengers in other seats. The screen is a 12.1 inch HD-capable touchscreen. A remote is also located in the seat rest. All portions of the Thales TopSeries entertainment system are complimentary in First Class, except the GoGo in-flight wi-fi.

There are 24 Main Cabin Extra seats and 96 Main Cabin seats, all in a 3-3 configuration. In a press release, American says that the seat bottoms will produce an ’œinnovative cradling motion to better distribute weight while increasing the recline angle of the seatback.’ Each seat is equipped with one universal AC power outlet and a USB jack. The screens in the Main Cabin are an 8.9 inch HD-capable touchscreen. However, the entire entertainment system is not free. Customers will have the option to view complimentary content, pay-to-access packages, or pay-per-view movies.

Main Cabin entertainment options:

Complimentary content includes NBC Universal Television (the linear video programming that currently runs on the main screen), 18 American Airlines audio channels, and a collection of short content videos.

Starting at $4, customers can access packages of more than 150 network and premium television shows, 300 albums, audio books and games, and up to 200 movies on longer flights ’“ all on-demand.

The A319s will feature a new content library called Disney Family Room. For one price, customs can access a package of movies, television programs, music and more from Disney.

ATG-4 Wi-Fi throughout the aircraft.

The new onboard product is standard for all Airbus A319 deliveries. As for the A321, there will be an A321 Domestic configuration and an A321 Transcontinental configuration. The A321 domestic configuration will fly domestic flights that have a high demand, and the domestic configuration will offer virtually the same onboard product as the A319. However, the A321 Transcontinental configuration will fly transcon flights with a 3-class premium product configuration. The A321Ts will have cloth seats in the Main Cabin, owing to their longer flight times. The first A321 aircraft will be delivered just before year end, and the inaugural flight is scheduled for January 7 from LAX-JFK. Airchive will be onboard covering this flight.

As for the other aircraft in American’s fleet, many, if not most, aircraft will not be retrofitted with the new products as they will be retired soon. The first Boeing 737-800 to feature the new onboard product will be delivered in October. It remains unclear if the existing Boeing 737-800s will be retrofitted.

A little more than 14 months before taking delivery of the first A319 aircraft, Captain Mark Maestas, American’s Airbus Fleet Captain, began to review Airbus’ flight manuals to customize them for American’s pilots. He worked with check airmen, Airbus, and the FAA to ensure that they were completely compliant with all the rules and regulations. John Lohmar, American’s Airbus Fleet Training Manager, developed an extensive program to train pilots to transition to the A319. Approximately 40 pilots are qualified to fly American’s new Airbus aircraft each month. After completing training, pilots will be able to fly the A319 and A321 interchangeably. When asked how flying the MD-80 is compared to flying the A319, Captain Lohmar said, ’œIt is like getting a 2013 vehicle to replace your 1988 vehicle.’

For flight attendants, they have the option of taking a four-day training class to become certified to fly the Airbus aircraft. They need to be trained to operate the doors, the cabin computer management system, and other emergency procedures before working a flight with passengers. American has already held a few training classes for flight attendants.

American Airlines still has to complete the FAA certification process to fly passengers before the inaugural flight on September 16 from Dallas-Fort Worth to Charlotte. American will also begin A319 service to Cleveland, Memphis, and Wichita from DFW on September 16. American has taken delivery of 3 A319s and will have 6 by the entry-into-service date. Other markets such as Bogota, Dayton, Los Angeles, and McAllen will begin later this year.

With the hundred-or-so Fort Worth-based American Airline employees attending the unveiling, it was evident that they were proud of the new onboard product. Some employees said it was ’œsleek’ and ’œlovely.’ Many were speechless, but everybody wanted to take their photos in front of the new Silverbird.

NTSB: No distress call prior to UPS cargo plane crash in Alabama - CNN,"Wed, 14 Aug 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAxMy8wOC8xNC91cy9hbGFiYW1hLWNhcmdvLXBsYW5lLWNyYXNoL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Story highlights NEW: There was no distress call from the pilots prior to impact, the NTSB says NTSB investigators unable to immediately retrieve plane's recorders, official says The pilot and co-pilot of the UPS plane die in the crash A photograph shows the jet's crumpled front end resting amid debris

Birmingham, Alabama CNN —

The pilot and co-pilot of a UPS cargo plane did not issue a distress call prior to crashing while on approach Wednesday to Birmingham’s airport, a National Transportation Safety Board official said.

While UPS said the status of its crew remained unconfirmed, Birmingham Airport Authority Chairwoman Gaynell Hendricks and the city’s mayor confirmed the pilot and co-pilot died in the crash.

“It’s a grim scene,” Hendricks told CNN affiliate WBRC.

The plane, an Airbus A300-600F, broke into pieces, spreading the majority of the debris over an area of about 300 yards, said Robert Sumwalt of the NTSB. A photograph provided by city officials shows the crumpled front portion of the plane resting in a debris-strewn field.

The plane, which took off from Louisville, Kentucky, went down around 4:45 a.m. on a street that runs parallel to the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport, Mayor William Bell said.

The location is about a half-mile north of the runway, FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen told CNN.

NTSB investigators have yet to retrieve the cockpit and voice recorders of the plane because the wreckage is still smoldering, Sumwalt said. Once the fire is out, authorities will retrieve the recorders, he said.

Even so, investigators have begun working to piece together what led to the crash.

The crew did not issue a distress call, Sumwalt said, confirming what the mayor said earlier.

The crew did not report any trouble, Bell said, citing conversations with control tower officials. Light showers and a visibility of 10 miles were reported in the area of the airport at the time of the crash, according to CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen.

A spokesman for Bell, the mayor, confirmed late Wednesday morning that no buildings were hit and no one on the ground was injured.

Five facts to calm plane crash fears

Alabama Power cut electricity to about 140 buildings near the crash site as a precaution, utility spokesman Michael Sznajderman told CNN.

Witness Peter Torres, a Civil Air Patrol member who said he is a former airline mechanic, said he thought he heard what sounded like a backfire from the jet’s engines as the plane passed overhead. He rushed to his window.

“I saw the flash,” of an apparent explosion, he said, followed by a “boom” that shook his home.

Airport neighbor Sharon Wilson told WBRC the plane seemed lower than usual for flights into the airport and sounded like it was sputtering as it flew overhead.

“We heard this loud boom, like, jump up out of your bed,” she told the station.

The plane was one of two flights UPS sends to Birmingham each day, company spokesman Mike Mangeot told CNN affiliate WBRC.

“This incident is very unfortunate, and our thoughts and prayers are with those involved,” UPS Airlines President Mitch Nichols said in a statement.

The plane that crashed Wednesday was built in 2003 and had 11,000 hours in the air spread over 6,800 flights, Airbus said in a news release.

Only UPS and FedEx fly the A300 in the United States, according to its manufacturer, Airbus. While it was once used for commercial passenger flights in the United States, the plane is now used only for cargo flights. UPS has 53 of the planes, according to Airbus.

Wednesday’s crash is the second involving an A300 in the United States. In 2001, an American Airlines A300 crashed in the Belle Harbor neighborhood of Queens, in New York City, shortly after takeoff from John F. Kennedy International Airport.

All 260 people on board the plane, as well as five people on the ground, were killed.

The cause was ultimately attributed to pilot error, according to the NTSB, which said the first officer put excessive pressure on the rudder pedal, causing the separation of the vertical stabilizer.

The Birmingham crash is the second fatal accident involving a large jet in the United States since early July, when an Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 crashed on landing at San Francisco International Airport. Three people died.

Wednesday’s crash comes nearly three years after UPS’s last major incident, the crash of a Boeing 747 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, that killed two crew members.

Investigators traced the crash to a large fire in the cargo hold, which included a number of flammable lithium batteries, according to the country’s General Civil Aviation Authority.

In 2006, a McDonnell Douglas DC-8 flown by UPS caught fire after landing at Philadelphia International Airport.

UPDATE 8/15: UPS Airbus A300-600F Crashes in Birmingham - Airline Reporter,"Wed, 14 Aug 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMy8wOC91cHMtYWlyYnVzLWEzMDAtNjAwZi1jcmFzaGVzLWluLWJpcm1pbmdoYW0v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Initial story posted 08/14/13, scroll down for the most recent updates on UPS Flight 1354 crash.

Early this morning, an Airbus A300-600F operated by UPS crashed at Birmington Airport (BHM) killing both the pilot and co-pilot. UPS Flight 1354 was heading from Louisville, KY to BHM when it crashed short of runway 18.

At the time of the accident the weather seemed clear, and the NTSB has stated there were not any distress calls made from the aircraft.

Airbus has stated that the plane in question (MSN841) was delivered to UPS in 2003 and had about 11,000 flight hours (over 6,800 flights) at the time of the crash. They also state that they will, “provide full technical assistance to the French BEA as well as to the authorities who will be responsible for the accident investigation. A team of specialists from Airbus is being dispatched to Alabama.”

In a press release, UPS Airlines President Mitch Nichols stated, “This incident is very unfortunate, and our thoughts and prayers are with those involved. We place the utmost value on the safety of our employees, our customers and the public. We will immediately engage with the National Transportation Safety Board’s investigation, and we will work exhaustively on response efforts.”

UPS A300 CRASH UPDATE 1 – 08/15:

The NTSB held a press conference a bit before 5:30pm EST and gave additional details about the crash.

The black boxes have not yet been found due to the amount of damage located around their location and smoldering debris.

The plane struck trees before crashing.

The NTSB stated that the cockpit ended up about 200yds from the initial impact location and that the center section, containing the wings, was located about 75-85yds closer to the runway.

Airbus A300 debris is scattered around the airport and even in surrounding homes.

We do not know at this time if there was any hazardous cargo.

There was 10 miles of visibility at the time of the accident.

Names of the pilots have not yet been released.

UPS A300 CRASH UPDATE 2 – 08/16:

The NTSB held another press conference today sharing additional information:

The two black boxes were recovered. They were were previously difficult to locate due to fire and damage.

The boxes were quite damaged, but the NTSB is “cautiously optimistic” that they will still provide quality data.

The recorders are being sent to Washington DC to be inspected and they should know sometime tomorrow if the data is usable.

Their initial investigation has shown there is no sign of engine failure or fire before impact.

There is evidence that debris, such as dirt and wood, were ingested into the engines.

The runway used, 18, is the shorter of the two runways at 7,000 feet long. The longer 6/24 (which is almost 12,000 feet long) was closed at the time of the accident.

Runway 18 does not have an Instrument Landing System (ILS).

Lost Airline Livery: An Orange Donbassaero Airbus A320 Gets Parted - Airline Reporter,"Fri, 23 Aug 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMy8wOC9sb3N0LWFpcmxpbmUtbGl2ZXJ5LWFuLW9yYW5nZS1kb25iYXNzYWVyby1haXJidXMtYTMyMC1nZXRzLXBhcnRlZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Today I pay my respects to a little-known (now defunct) Ukrainian airline by honoring their wild livery and individualism. Donbassaero’s bold, in-your-face paint scheme oddly reminds me of something you might see on a 1970s muscle car like the Oldsmobile 442.

This livery and airline is extra special. You see, while the rest of the world’s airlines were trending towards boring, mostly white (read: cheap) liveries referred to as “Eurowhite,” Donbassaero did the opposite.

Yes, Donbassaero actually went from a plain-jane Eurowhite livery to this bold, orange funky paint scheme.

Let’s be honest; bucking the trend of Eurowhite adoption and going with this crazy livery certainly made Donbassaero unique. Unfortunately, it didn’t save them.

According to their website, which is eerily still up and running, Donebassaero was established in 1993 and operated an all-Airbus fleet. The airline filed for bankruptcy and ceased operation on January 14, 2013.

This particular bird, an A320 originally registered as UR-DAB with the airline, got its start in 1991 with Mexicana. It hopped around the world with a dozen carriers before ultimately finding its way to Jet Midwest in Kansas City, MO, where its deconstruction began.

The entire front section of the fuselage was sliced off and will be re-purposed for a flight simulator. What’s left will be parted out to breathe new life into other planes, or simply recycled.

If this livery looks familiar, it’s because other versions were shared with Donbassaero’s sister carriers (which have also come under difficult financial times): Aerosvit and Dniproavia.

It is always a bit sad to see an airliner scrapped, but kind of neat thinking that parts of UR-DAB will still be flying around the world for many years to come.

Final Airbus A318 Operated By A North American Airline Retired - NYCAviation,"Wed, 21 Aug 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55Y2F2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDEzLzA4L2xhc3QtYWlyYnVzLWEzMTgtb3BlcmF0ZWQtYnktYS1ub3J0aC1hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lLXJldGlyZWQvMzAyNDnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A318 can be thought of as the black sheep of the Airbus family. With a grand total of only 79 airframes built, the A318 program was simply not meant to be. Earlier this month, the final A318 based in North America, belonging to Frontier Airlines, has been retired at the young age of 10. Delivered in late 2003, N803FR operated its last passenger flight on August 5th from Denver to Phoenix Sky Harbor, and now resides at Goodyear Airport where it awaits the chopping block.

Frontier was actually the launch customer of the Airbus A318 in 2003, but not the only North American airline to order the type. America West had also ordered the A318, but later converted their orders to larger A319s and A320s. TWA also ordered the A318, but never saw delivery before declaring chapter 11 and purchase by American Airlines.

When initially designed, the Airbus A318 made sense as a larger regional jet. Once jet fuel prices went through the roof, however, the A318 made less and less sense. Requiring the same amount of crew on board as the A319, weighing just 3,000 pounds less and having only 85% the seating capacity of the A319, the A318 just couldn’t find its place in the market. The introduction of much more efficient and economical regional jets such as the Embraer E-Jet series and larger CRJs sealed the A318s fate.

The A318 does have one trick up its sleeve that still makes it valuable to a few airlines. The A318 is the largest commercial aircraft certified by the European Aviation Safety Agency for steep approach operations. The A318’s steep approach procedure enables a 5.5 degree descent angle, rather than the standard 3 degrees. This trick is particularly useful for British Airways, who operates a pair of A318’s (G-EUNA & G-EUNB) out of London City Airport in downtown London to New York JFK in an all business class configuration. This service is thought of as a Concord replacement, using the same flight numbers.

Elsewhere, the A318 can still be found operating commercially with Air France, Avianca and Avianca Brazil, LAN Chile, and TAROM in Romania, as well as privately. Similar to the A318, the Boeing 737-600 suffered the same fate as the A318, with only 69 airframes produced. The 737-600, however, can be found operating within North America with Westjet.

"Peek inside British Airways' first Airbus A380, the world’s largest commercial jet - Luxurylaunches","Fri, 02 Aug 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vbHV4dXJ5bGF1bmNoZXMuY29tL3RyYXZlbC9wZWVrLWluc2lkZS1icml0aXNoLWFpcndheXMtZmlyc3QtYTM4MC10aGUtd29ybGRzLWxhcmdlc3QtY29tbWVyY2lhbC1qZXQucGhw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

The British aviation industry has just been paid a visit by the stork. Heathrow has had a super-sized delivery making British Airways’ the first airline in the UK to acquire the A380, the largest commercial jet in the world. Besides the double-decker carrier, British Airlines is also the first in Europe to operate the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which also landed at Heathrow last week. Fragments of carbon fiber have come together to form an incredible flying machine that renders an exceptional in-flight feel. With takeoffs and landings much quieter than our regular flying- fare, the A380 has a married environment- friendliness to a sumptuous flying experience.





The interior design isn’t the usual fare either. Impeccable attention- to- detail has given birth to sleek sophistication, creating a sense of inviting comfort, far off from the claustrophobia-inducing aircraft atmosphere.



The British Airways’ A380s accommodate 469 customers across four cabins, with extensive emphasis on space. Customers in First will acquire the prime spot in front of the main deck. The fourteen-seating front space is said to be a notch up from their current First class. With 30 percent more personal space and 60 percent more personal stowage, its innovative design exudes an air of luxurious elegance.



Club World (business class) customers have seating- choices of two different decks- the upper, which has 53 seats, or the main deck with 44. These upper deck chairs come with a new 2:3:2 configuration across the cabin that seeks to be an addition to its prevailing plushness.



The 55 World Traveller Plus (premier economy) seats will occupy the upper deck, and World Traveller (economy) customers can choose from the main and upper deck.



With prices starting from £621 ($942) return, the very first long-haul flight on the A380 will be to Los Angeles on September 24, 2013, promptly followed by Hong Kong on October 22 with prices from £688 ($1043) return. The A380 is the first of the 12 double-decker indulgences due for delivery by 2016.

Vueling order puts pressure on Iberia - EL PAÍS USA,"Fri, 16 Aug 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5lbHBhaXMuY29tL2VscGFpcy8yMDEzLzA4LzE2L2luZW5nbGlzaC8xMzc2NjczNjc4Xzk0OTM2Ni5odG1s0gFcaHR0cHM6Ly9lbmdsaXNoLmVscGFpcy5jb20vZWxwYWlzLzIwMTMvMDgvMTYvaW5lbmdsaXNoLzEzNzY2NzM2NzhfOTQ5MzY2Lmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A Vueling jet prepares for departure. ULY MARTÍN

After taking full control of low-cost carrier Vueling in April, IAG — the holding company created by the merger of Iberia and British Airways — announced on Wednesday that it was earmarking 120 jetliners from a new multibillion-dollar order for up to 220 Airbus A320 single-aisle aircraft for the Barcelona-based firm. The move reflects the importance of Vueling to IAG in meeting its goal of double-digit growth over the next two years.

It is also a clear signal to Ryanair and Easyjet that IAG intends to carve out a larger share of the low-cost market, as well as a new way to pressure Iberia into speeding up a restructuring plan that involves over 3,000 layoffs and starting to make money. IAG’s message has been that growing with Iberia meant losing money; its shopping spree at Boeing and Airbus seems to be saying that growing with Vueling will mean bigger profits.

“These new aircraft will enable Vueling to continue that expansion and replace some of its older fleet with modern, fuel-efficient aircraft, leading to further unit-cost reductions,” IAG Chief Executive Willie Walsh said Wednesday in a statement announcing the plane order.

IAG has fought hard to compete with low-cost carriers in Europe, especially in Spain, where Ryanair and Easyjet have taken the lion’s share of the market for low-price business and vacation travel from Iberia amid high fuel prices and a sickly economy.

IAG has cut half-year losses following restructuring at the loss-making Spanish carrier. The holding company reported a reduced operating loss of 33 million euros for the half year to June 30 against a loss of 253 million euros in the same period a year earlier before exceptional items.

The group swung back into the black with a second-quarter operating profit of 245 million euros compared to a loss of four million euros. A reduction in fuel costs and improved passenger revenues — with total revenue up 2.1 percent in the six months to 8.7 billion euros — helped boost the results.

The 62 jetliners cost 4.8 billion euros, way above the 200 million-euro valuation IAG put on the company

In 2011, IAG ordered eight Airbus 330s for Iberia’s long-haul fleet, with an option to buy eight more. In April, it ordered 18 Airbus 350s, with options to buy another 18. It also ordered 18 Boeing 787s for British Airways’ long-haul routes. It has said new purchases for Iberia will depend on the speed of the restructuring program.

Vueling is the clear winner here. After a two-year wait, it has finally acquired the new aircraft it needs to expand its routes. The 62 jetliners cost 4.8 billion euros, a figure way above the 200 million-euro valuation IAG put on the company when it launched its takeover bid last November. For the last two years Vueling has been looking for ways to renew its aging fleet. It never imagined it would have 120 new planes at its disposal.

The announcement comes at a particularly difficult time for Vueling. This month has seen a number of mechanical problems with its planes — 100 passengers were left stranded at Dubrovnik airport last weekend — and it is now being investigated by the Public Works Ministry.

Vueling was set up 10 years ago, and has grown to around a quarter of the size of Iberia, both in terms of turnover and the number of passengers it carries per kilometer. This is why the company itself had doubts about joining IAG, particularly after Iberia, which already controlled 45 percent of Vueling, set up its own low-cost carrier, Iberia Express.

IAG took full control of Vueling in April, and has committed to expanding the airline’s business. IAG said it expected to boost capacity for the group by 5.2 percent this year, with Vueling’s capacity rising by 2.4 percent.

Vueling flies to more than 100 destinations in Europe and North Africa. Industry data provider Absolute Aviation Advantage ranks it fourth among the top 10 low-cost carriers in Europe, based on its market share of seven percent.

Álex Cruz, who took over as president of Vueling last week, replacing former Popular Party Industry Minister Josep Piqué, seems to have won over IAG’s CEO Willy Walsh. Cruz believes Vueling’s profitability will mean that Walsh, a man who understands the low-cost sector, will respect the company’s identity, rather than incorporating it into either of the two flag carriers. The growth potential that the new aircraft give Vueling would seem to support the idea it may emerge as the group’s short-haul carrier.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9004029631614685}",positive,0.9004029631614685,1

European aircraft maker Airbus had called upon the regulator to investigate the advertisement placed in the magazine Flight International, as part of an ongoing trade war between the aviation giants.

Boeing did not mislead readers of a trade magazine when touting the advantages of its 747-8 jumbo jet over rival Airbus' A380 model, Britain's Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) ruled on Wednesday.

Boeing is still awaiting a ruling on the Airbus ads the aircraft manufacturer published in response to its own ad. Credit: Airbus

The spat, which led Airbus to take out a competing ad showing a Boeing jet nose grotesquely elongated to resemble Pinocchio's, comes as the rhetoric between the planemakers becomes more heated even as both enjoy record backlogs. Executives from both companies have exchanged public barbs about the inferiority of each other's products and strategy.

In its decision, the ASA judged the readers of the specialised publication to be ""experts"" who were used to these types of comparisons, however imperfect they might be.

""We considered that the intended audience of the ad, those involved in the decision-making process to purchase large aircraft, would have a high-level understanding in this area and would be familiar with the method of comparison used by Boeing,"" it said.

""We also considered they were unlikely to make a purchase decision without seeking a great deal more information on the potential advantages of the aeroplane, based on their own specific requirements,"" it added.

Airlines ordered to inspect beacons after Boeing 787 fire - CBC News,"Fri, 16 Aug 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzL2FpcmxpbmVzLW9yZGVyZWQtdG8taW5zcGVjdC1iZWFjb25zLWFmdGVyLWJvZWluZy03ODctZmlyZS0xLjEzNTMyNTXSASBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYmMuY2EvYW1wLzEuMTM1MzI1NQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Transport Canada has ordered airlines to inspect the emergency beacons on their aircraft in the wake of a July 12 fire on a Boeing 787 at London’s Heathrow Airport.

The Canadian regulator said inspections should take place on a broad range of planes that have Honeywell beacons, including Boeing, Airbus, McDonnell Douglas, ATR, Lockheed Martin Corp and Dassault Aviation.

British investigators are still determining the cause of a fire aboard a parked Boeing 787 owned by Ethiopian Airlines, but they found pinched wires on a Honeywell emergency locator transmitter.

The beacons are carried by all airplanes to send a radio signal in the event of a crash and help rescue workers locate the wreckage.

The Honeywell ELTs are made in conjunction with Instrumar Ltd, a supplier based in St. Johns. Honeywell said it had produced nearly 6,000 of the devices and supports the move to inspect them, although there has been no definitive ruling on the cause of the fire.

Meanwhile, Japan’s All Nippon Airways is saying it found faulty wiring in the fire extinguisher system of its Boeing 787 jets. Boeing already recommended customers inspect planes with Honeywell ELTs, but Airbus has yet to issue an order.

The Transport Canada directive covers 11 Boeing-made models including the 787, 777 and 737 and seven from Airbus, including the A320, A330 and A380. Airlines were also ordered to check Dassault Aviation SA’s Falcon 7X business jet and Lockheed Martin Corporation’s L-382.

The rule takes effect on Aug. 26 and operators have 150 days to comply.

Other countries grounded the 787 in January after the Federal Aviation Administration halted flights on the planes in the U.S. following two incidents in which lithium-ion batteries overheated. Most of those planes have passed inspection and returned to the air.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.989794135093689}",neutral,0.989794135093689,0
Airbus A350 makes its first 'virtual flight' - Executive Traveller,"Thu, 22 Aug 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtbWFrZXMtaXRzLWZpcnN0LXZpcnR1YWwtZmxpZ2h00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A350 has made its first ‘virtual passenger flight’, with 129 passengers and a cabin crew supplied by Cathay Pacific taking part in a four hour dry run in an A350 mock-up dubbed ‘Cabin Zero’.

The make-believe flight is another milestone in the road towards the A350’s debut into commercial service in mid-2014, and follows the next-gen jetliner’s first actual flight on June 14th.

Here’s an inside look at this flight of fancy – Flight 0900 from the Canary Islands to Hamburg, Germany…

On July 25, 129 passengers on Flight 0900 received their boarding passes, walked into the cabin, stashed their trolley bags in the overhead lockers and took their seats for what they hoped would be a comfortable and event-free journey.

The flight took off a little later than scheduled – not so unusual in today’s operating environment – but around four hours later the captain announced over the PA that they had made up time and the aircraft had begun its descent.

All perfectly routine, you might think, until you realised that the aircraft never actually left the ground.

In fact the whole 'flight' took place in a full-scale cabin mock-up in the Airbus plant situated on the outskirts of Hamburg.

This was ‘CVFF’ – the cabin virtual first flight and engineering test staged in the A350 XWB Cabin Integration and Test Centre.

It was the latest stage in the development of this revolutionary new aircraft type, running in parallel with the flight test campaign that has seen the A350 perform 15 flights so far.

The big selling point of the A350 XWB is its efficiency, which relates not just to a reduced fuel burn and CO2 emissions but also the cabin design.

Airbus states that “smooth curves, flowing lines, innovative lighting and wide windows” will feature in the cabin, and each of these elements was incorporated into the mock-up, dubbed Cabin Zero.

The dimensions of the cabin were reproduced to the centimetre, although only the forward and aft sections were included. Business and Economy Class seats were installed – albeit without working video screens – and fully operational galleys were fitted.

There was air-conditioning, mood lighting, realistic flight sounds (courtesy of Microsoft Flight Simulator)… everything, in fact, to make it look and feel like a real flight.

Cathay Pacific adds the real to the virtual

And then there were the CX cabin crew.

“We thought this was the right time to put Cabin Zero to the test in a real operational environment with real cabin crew,” says Michel Treillet, Customer Programme Director for the A350 XWB programme.

“Cabin Zero was developed as an engineering platform but we wanted to take it further “and use it as if it were a real aircraft.”

""For that we needed real cabin crew and so we called on Cathay Pacific for help, based on our experience with them in the past and also because CX is a big customer for the A350.”

Nine crew were recruited for the exercise, all of them going through three days of intensive training prior to the day of the trial.

“I wanted to get accurate information to our crew in advance of the exercise because I knew it would be a big challenge for them, working in a brand new environment with new galley arrangements and standards, and with different types of service equipment” explains Cathay Pacific Inflight Technical Operations Manager Inez Mok, who coordinated with the project team to get a full understanding of the whole process.

The three-day briefing course included a thorough introduction to Cabin Zero, followed by familiarisation procedures for cabin checks, the passenger doors, the flight attendant panel and cabin intercommunication data system.

Flight 0900 takes wing

When passengers on Flight 0900 settled into their seats, the crew set about their pre-flight routine as they would for any CX flight.

From a passenger perspective the virtual flight was every bit the real deal, from the announcements to fasten seat belts to settling down for a hearty hot lunch.

All passengers were asked to behave as they would on a normal flight, though some were given special assignments to test various aspects of the inflight equipment.

Airbus engineers sat at work stations in a special section between the Business Class and Economy cabins, monitoring various technical aspects of the virtual flight.

The day didn’t end when the flight came in for its virtual landing. Passengers were asked to sit down and complete detailed questionnaires about their entire experience on the virtual flight.

The cabin crew went through individual debriefings to give Airbus invaluable feedback on the cabin and its workings, from galley equipment to the layout of crew rest areas.

“What the CX crew have given us is valuable input to prepare for the A350’s entry into service,” says Airbus A380 programme director Treillet, adding that first test aircraft to be fitted with a cabin, MSN002, is now being assembled in Toulouse.

“We will gather all the feedback and take a close look at what things need to be changed or modified. It’s always a challenge to match an engineering platform with the final cabin but I think CVFF has been an invaluable intermediate step in terms of the cabin development.”

"Aviation: Airbus A300 cargo plane crashes in US, 2 dead - WeatherWatch.co.nz","Wed, 14 Aug 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlYXRoZXJ3YXRjaC5jby5uei9jb250ZW50L2F2aWF0aW9uLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzAwLWNhcmdvLXBsYW5lLWNyYXNoZXMtaW4tdXMtMi1kZWFk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The pilot and co-pilot of a UPS cargo plane died Wednesday when their jet crashed, broke into pieces and burned near Birmingham’s airport, officials said.

While UPS said the status of its crew remained unconfirmed, Birmingham Airport Authority Chairwoman Gaynell Hendricks and the city’s mayor confirmed the deaths.

“It’s a grim scene,” Hendricks told CNN affiliate WBRC.

It appears the plane, an Airbus A300, broke into at least two pieces. A photograph provided by city officials shows the crumpled front portion of the plane resting in a debris-strewn field.The plane, which took off from Louisville, Kentucky, went down on a street that runs parallel to the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport, Mayor William Bell said.

The location is about a kilometre north of the runway, FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen told CNN.

What caused the jet to crash around 4:45 a.m. was unclear. The crew did not report any trouble, Bell said, citing conversations with control tower officials. Light showers and a visibility of 16kms were reported in the area of the airport at the time of the crash, according to CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen.

The National Transportation Safety Board was sending a team to the site, NTSB board member Robert Sumwalt told reporters.

A spokesman for Bell confirmed late Wednesday morning that no buildings were hit and no one on the ground was injured.

Alabama Power cut electricity to about 140 buildings near the crash site as a precaution, utility spokesman Michael Sznajderman told CNN.

Witness Peter Torres, a Civil Air Patrol member who said he is a former airline mechanic, said he thought he heard what sounded like a backfire from the jet’s engines as the plane passed overhead. He rushed to his window.

“I saw the flash,” of an apparent explosion, he said, followed by a “boom” that shook his home.

Airport neighbor Sharon Wilson told WBRC the plane seemed lower than usual for flights into the airport and sounded like it was sputtering as it flew overhead.

“We heard this loud boom, like, jump up out of your bed,” she told the station.

The plane was one of two flights UPS sends to Birmingham each day, company spokesman Mike Mangeot told CNN affiliate WBRC.

“This incident is very unfortunate, and our thoughts and prayers are with those involved,” UPS Airlines President Mitch Nichols said in a statement.

The plane that crashed Wednesday was built in 2003 and had 11,000 hours in the air spread over 6,800 flights, Airbus said in a news release.

Only UPS and FedEx fly the A300 in the United States, according to its manufacturer, Airbus. While it was once used for commercial passenger flights in the United States, the plane is now used only for cargo flights. UPS has 53 of the planes, according to Airbus.

Wednesday’s crash is the second involving an A300 in the United States. In 2001, an American Airlines A300 crashed in the Belle Harbor neighborhood of Queens, in New York City, shortly after takeoff from John F. Kennedy International Airport.

All 260 people on board the plane, as well as five people on the ground, were killed.

The cause was ultimately attributed to pilot error, according to the NTSB, which said the first officer put excessive pressure on the rudder pedal, causing the separation of the vertical stabilizer.

The Birmingham crash is the second fatal accident involving a large jet in the United States since early July, when an Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 crashed on landing at San Francisco International Airport. Three people died.

Wednesday’s crash comes nearly three years after UPS’s last major incident, the crash of a Boeing 747 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, that killed two crew members.

Investigators traced the crash to a large fire in the cargo hold, which included a number of flammable lithium batteries, according to the country’s General Civil Aviation Authority.

In 2006, a McDonnell Douglas DC-8 flown by UPS caught fire after landing at Philadelphia International Airport. Three crew members on the plane evacuated with minor injuries, according to NTSB records. Most of the cargo was destroyed.

British Airways owner International Airlines Group (IAG) has announced it could buy up to 220 new Airbus A320 aircraft worth £12bn as part of plans to refresh its short-haul fleet.



The firm, which includes Spain’s national flag carrier Iberia and newly acquired low-cost airline Vueling, said late last night up to 120 of the planes would be for the budget airline.



The new aircraft would enable the Barcelona-based carrier to replace some of its existing A320 fleet and expand its business.

The Vueling agreement comprises 62 firm orders – 30 A320ceos and 32 A320neos – plus an option on 58 more.



IAG said the firm orders will be delivered to Vueling between 2015 and 2020.

The deal is likely to be funded by a new capital raising. IAG currently has net debt of £850m and in the past has issued bonds to cover the cost of its new fleet.

The airline group has been busy shopping for planes in recent months. In April it ordered 18 new Airbus A350 aircraft as part of a move to phase out a fleet of 30 Boeing aircraft over the next 10 years.

Final assembly of the A320 family takes place in Toulouse, France, and Hamburg, Germany

That deal also allows for an option of a further 18 A350 aeroplanes. In addition to yesterday’s Vueling order IAG has secured 100 A320neo options which could be used for any of the airlines in the group - British Airways, Iberia or Vueling.

IAG chief executive, Willie Walsh, said: ‘Vueling has managed to successfully expand its business profitably by targeting both growth markets and those areas where weak competitors are reducing capacity.

China Bank lends PAL $329 M for new planes - Inquirer.net,"Fri, 16 Aug 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3MuaW5xdWlyZXIubmV0LzEzODY5MS9jaGluYS1iYW5rLWxlbmRzLXBhbC0zMjktbS1mb3ItbmV3LXBsYW5lc9IBUmh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3MuaW5xdWlyZXIubmV0LzEzODY5MS9jaGluYS1iYW5rLWxlbmRzLXBhbC0zMjktbS1mb3ItbmV3LXBsYW5lcy9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MANILA, Philippines – China Banking Corp. (China Bank) has arranged a $329 million financing for Philippine Airlines’ purchase of seven new Airbus aircraft as part of the flag carrier’s refleeting program.

China Bank, which is part of the SM group of companies, is the sole arranger for the financing for seven Airbus A321-200 aircraft.

The first of these state-of-the-art jets, said to be among the most modern and safest airplanes to soar in Philippine skies, arrived in Manila from Hamburg, Germany last August 7.

The aircraft were being financed through an innovative operating lease basis which the bank said was reflective of PAL’s ability to “diversify its funding sources and effectively manage its capital requirements.”

“China Bank is honored to support PAL in its fleet renewal program and the modernization of the country’s aviation sector,” China Bank president Peter Dee said in a press statement on Friday, which coincides with the bank’s 93rd anniversary celebration.

China Bank is a key player in aircraft financing. It also acted as sole arranger for the acquisition of four new airplanes of another airline company early this year.

The arrival of its first A321 officially puts in motion Philippine Airlines’ fleet renewal that covers firm orders for 65 aircraft from Airbus in what is the largest aircraft purchase in Philippine history.

The A321 joins the Airbus fleet at PAL that currently includes 22 320 aircraft flying on domestic and regional routes, with eight in service with affiliate carrier PAL Express. PAL also operates eight wide-body A330s on higher capacity routes across Asia and six A340-300s on its transpacific flights.

PAL plans to operate the twin-engine A321s primarily on select domestic, regional and international routes, confident that this aircraft type offers a competitive advantage owing to its seat capacity, cost efficiency and modern look.

China Bank offers a wide range of financial products and services through over 300 branches nationwide, which it plans to expand to 415 by 2014, and more than 500 strategically-located ATMs (including thrift bank subsidiary China Bank Savings).

The bank recently announced its first semester profits of P2.96 billion, up by 46 percent year-on-year, driven by improvements in core operations.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998089671134949}",neutral,0.9998089671134949,0
