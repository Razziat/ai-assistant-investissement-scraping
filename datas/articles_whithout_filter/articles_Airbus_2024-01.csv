First ZEROe engine fuel cell successfully powers on - Airbus,"Tue, 16 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDI0LTAxLWZpcnN0LXplcm9lLWVuZ2luZS1mdWVsLWNlbGwtc3VjY2Vzc2Z1bGx5LXBvd2Vycy1vbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In late 2023, the ZEROe teams powered on the iron pod, the future hydrogen-propulsion system designed for Airbus’ electric concept aircraft. As well as the hydrogen fuel cell system, the iron pod contains the electric motors needed to spin a propeller and the units that control and keep them cool. Its successful power on at 1.2 megawatts is a pivotal step on Airbus’ ZEROe roadmap to put a hydrogen-propulsion aircraft into service by 2035.

The power of the world’s most abundant element

In 2020, Airbus shared four hydrogen-powered aircraft concepts with the public. Three used hydrogen combustion and hybrid engines for power, and the fourth was fully electric, using hydrogen fuel cells and a propeller propulsion system. These fuel cells work by transforming the hydrogen into electricity through a chemical reaction. The by-product of the reaction is simple H 2 O, resulting in almost zero emissions.

The huge potential of hydrogen fuel cells to decarbonise aviation made it one of the key technologies chosen to be further explored for the ZEROe demonstrator – but there was a challenge. Although hydrogen fuel cells already existed on the market when the project began, none provided the energy needed to power an aircraft while remaining at an acceptable weight level. So in October 2020, Airbus created Aerostack, a joint venture with ElringKlinger, to develop hydrogen fuel cell stacks that would be at the heart of the electric propulsion system on a ZEROe aircraft.

Extensive testing on the fuel cell system took place in Ottobrunn, Germany, just 13 kilometres from Munich, at the E-Aircraft System House (EAS). The Airbus facility is the largest test house for alternative propulsion systems and fuels in Europe, and it is where the main components of the propulsion system that will power the demonstrator’s propellers are tested.

In June 2023, Airbus announced the successful test campaign of the hydrogen fuel cell system, which reached its full-power level of 1.2 megawatts. It was the most powerful test ever achieved in aviation of a fuel cell designed for large-scale aircraft, and set the stage for the next big step of the project: integrating the full propulsion system with the electrical motor.

The countdown to ZEROe: Episode 3: Fuel Cell Systems Testing show more show less Airbus' hydrogen-powered aircraft is taking shape. Last time, we talked about one of the most promising propulsion candidates, which is the hydrogen fuel cell. Discover how Airbus is putting them to the test before flight.

Hydrogen powers on the iron pod

The big day took place at the end of 2023, closing out the year on a high for the ZEROe team. After successfully completing testing of the fuel cell system at 1.2 megawatts in June and the powertrain at 1 megawatt in October, the electric motors of the iron pod were powered on with the hydrogen fuel cells for the first time.

“It was a huge moment for us because the architecture and design principles of the system are the same as those that we will see in the final design,” says Mathias Andriamisaina, Head of Testing and Demonstration on the ZEROe project. “The complete power channel was run at 1.2 megawatts, the power we aim to test on our A380 demonstrator.”

Observing how the many systems interact during this testing is key to enabling the next steps of the project. “This process is how we learn what changes need to be made to make the technology flight-worthy,” says Hauke Peer-Luedders, Head of Fuel Cell Propulsion System for ZEROe. “We measure how the propulsion system as a whole works by testing the power needed for several different flight phases, such as takeoff, where we are reaching maximum power levels, and cruising, when we use less power but over a longer period of time.”

It has been three years since we revealed an aircraft concept 100% powered by hydrogen fuel cells. Since then, we have adhered to our initial timeline and made tremendous progress. The recent success of powering on the iron pod system at 1.2 megawatts is a crucial step towards our goal of putting a hydrogen-powered aircraft in the skies by 2035.

Preparing for the next step

Testing will continue on this first version of the iron pod throughout 2024. Once completed, the next step for the ZEROe team will be to optimise the size, mass and qualifications of the propulsion system to meet flight specifications. Qualifications include the system’s reactions to vibration, humidity and altitude, among other factors.

Once these optimisations and tests are complete, the fuel cell propulsion system will be installed on the ZEROe multimodal flight test platform – the very first A380 ever produced by Airbus, MSN001. This will be followed by the ground testing of the systems before the pivotal stage of testing them in flight on the A380, currently scheduled for 2026."

In the wake of the midair blowout of a door on a Boeing 737 MAX 9 earlier this month, the lead that Airbus has taken over Boeing in the manufacture and sales of the world’s commercial aircraft has, not surprisingly, grown. It’s actually been growing for some time: Last year, Airbus delivered 735 new planes to airlines and leasing companies, The New York Times reported, while Boeing delivered just 528. Airbus had an order backlog of 8,600 new planes, against Boeing’s 5,626. This month’s blowout reinforced the public’s—and consequently, the airlines’—doubts about Boeing’s commitment to safety, which soared after two disastrous crashes of its 737s in 2018 and 2019.

“What used to be a duopoly” in the manufacture of commercial aircraft, Richard Aboulafia of AeroDynamic Advisory told the Times, “has become two-thirds Airbus, one-third Boeing.”

The long descent of Boeing has now become the subject of widespread analysis in the mainstream media. A story last Saturday in The Wall Street Journal began with an account of one Boeing engineer’s white paper in 2001 that warned against the company’s new commitment to outsourcing production of key parts of the aircraft it assembled. But continuing to produce the parts in-house, with the work done by Boeing’s very experienced and unionized workforce, cut no mustard with Wall Street and the company’s new-model CEOs, who no longer came to their posts from careers in production, but rather from the financial side of the industry. In 2005, the company sold its Wichita plant to a private equity firm that slashed costs before unloading the plant to Spirit AeroSystems, which has become notorious for its deficient quality inspection practices.

More from Harold Meyerson

But this fish stunk from the head. Boeing continually objected to what it said were Spirit’s high costs and inability to meet deadlines. As the workers on the shop floor and their union repeatedly noted, this led to rushed production and deficient oversight. Workers—members of the International Association of Machinists—had “great quality and safety concerns,” one union representative wrote to union leaders, but their concerns were routinely ignored by senior management, the Journal reported.

So how are work practices at Airbus different from those at Boeing? I’m not arguing that Airbus provides a panacea for 21st-century production; a chunk of their own production, for instance, is outsourced as well. But consider, for starters, who actually owns the two companies. Airbus’s four largest shareholders, in order, are the government of France, the government of Germany, the Capital Research and Management Company, and the government of Spain. Boeing’s four largest shareholders, in order, are The Vanguard Group, Vanguard Group subfiler, Newport Trust Company, and State Street Corporation (a bank and asset manager). In other words, Airbus’s largest shareholders are mainly politically accountable governments that must pay heed to such public concerns as air safety; Boeing’s are entirely investors in business for profits.

Moreover, as the merger of German, French, and Spanish companies, Airbus production is centered in nations where workers historically and currently have more power than their U.S. counterparts. Forty-six thousand of Airbus’s roughly 130,000 employees work in the company’s German factories, where workers, by law, routinely discuss production and safety issues with managers in works councils. In the U.S., the Machinists are a union in which workers do have voice and power by American standards, but lack mechanisms like works councils through which management must take at least some heed of their concerns.

In sum, Airbus’s clear leadership over Boeing in matters of flight safety stem in good measure from their differences in ownership and worker power—that is, from the European model of mitigating laissez-faire capitalism with a measure of public and worker power, and from the American model of subjecting corporate policy almost entirely to the demands of investment institutions. Which, if you track the value of Boeing’s stock, hasn’t worked out that well for those investment institutions, either.

By the way, just how outsourced is Boeing production? Only yesterday, it was revealed the door plug that blew out of the Alaska Airlines plane wasn’t actually produced in Wichita. It was produced in Malaysia, where I very much doubt that workers’ concerns about speed of production and quality oversight have much impact on their managers. More significantly, the fact that the Malaysian production of the door plug didn’t come to light until yesterday—12 days after the blowout—suggests just how profoundly outsourcing can obscure the public visibility required for corporate accountability."
Airbus Is Pulling Ahead as Boeing's Troubles Mount - The New York Times,"Fri, 19 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDEvMTcvYnVzaW5lc3MvYWlyYnVzLWJvZWluZy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus cemented its position last week as the world’s biggest plane maker for the fifth straight year, announcing that it had delivered more aircraft and secured more orders than Boeing in 2023. At the same time, Boeing was trying to put out a huge public-relations and safety crisis caused by a harrowing near disaster involving its 737 Max line of airliners.

In the long-running duel between the two aviation rivals, Airbus has pulled far ahead.

“What used to be a duopoly has become two-thirds Airbus, one-third Boeing,” said Richard Aboulafia, the managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory in Washington, D.C. “A lot of people, whether investors, financiers or customers, are looking at Airbus and seeing a company run by competent people,” he said. “The contrast with Boeing is fairly profound.”

The incident involving the 737 Max 9, in which a hole blew open in the fuselage of an Alaska Airlines flight in midair, was the latest in a string of safety lapses in Boeing’s workhorse aircraft — including two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 — that are indirectly helping propel the fortunes of the European aerospace giant."

Why it matters: There simply aren't many alternatives out there.

The big picture: For the last three decades, U.S.-based Boeing and Europe's Airbus have been the only game in town for large commercial jets.

Single-aisle aircraft, or so-called narrow bodies, are the biggest segment of the commercial market.

Airlines like United essentially have two options: Boeing's 737 lineup and Airbus' equivalent family of A320s. Those two made up nearly 70% of United's mainline aircraft fleet at the end of 2022.

What they're saying: ""Well, I'll wait and see. Obviously, there's only one other manufacturer that's really an option for us,"" Kirby said yesterday on CNBC, when asked whether United could replace its delayed Boeing Max 10 orders with Airbus planes.

""And it probably means that we don't grow quite as fast as we are hoping,"" he said, acknowledging how bottlenecks for new aircraft could prevent the carrier from meeting surging travel demand.

State of play: The Boeing and Airbus duopoly isn't likely to end soon, even as the former suffers a string of manufacturing issues.

The industry has a high barrier of entry with enormous capital requirements. It's driven smaller manufacturers to focus on smaller regional jets and private aircraft.

It's also heavily regulated, with Boeing's and Airbus' relationships with regulators described as a ""historical partnership"" built around safety.

What to watch: Brazil-based Embraer has been hoping to crack the U.S. market for its E2 jets. But if a third choice were to emerge, it could be Commercial Aircraft Corp of China.

Both Boeing and Airbus have called the state-owned company a potential competitor. But Comac, as it's known, is unproven, and questions remain whether American or European carriers would buy Chinese planes in the current political environment.

The bottom line: Don't expect customers to give up on Boeing. Even Kirby yesterday called the company not just its most important partner, but ""one of the most important companies in the country."""
Boeing Outclassed as Airbus Posts Record-Breaking Orderbook - Skift Travel News,"Fri, 12 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjQvMDEvMTIvYm9laW5nLW91dGNsYXNzZWQtYXMtYWlyYnVzLXBvc3RzLXJlY29yZC1icmVha2luZy1vcmRlcmJvb2sv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly9za2lmdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wMS8xMi9ib2Vpbmctb3V0Y2xhc3NlZC1hcy1haXJidXMtcG9zdHMtcmVjb3JkLWJyZWFraW5nLW9yZGVyYm9vay9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This is the fifth consecutive year that Airbus has delivered more planes than Boeing, but recent events make the gulf between the companies feel even wider.

Just when Boeing thought this week couldn’t get much worse, its main competitor has published a strong set of year-end figures. Airbus delivered 735 commercial aircraft to 87 customers last year, representing an 11% rise versus 2022. While it’s tempting to write off the delivery total as a post-pandemic purge of legacy orders, the reality is quite different.

Between Boeing’s well-documented woes, an enticing catalog of its own crowd-pleasing products, and a lack of meaningful competition, Airbus has arguably become a victim of its own success. As of December 31, it had an order backlog of 8,598 aircraft – more than 11 times the number of planes it managed to deliver in 2023.

For context, even if Airbus doubled last year’s impressive output, the European firm would still find itself with a surplus of new orders for 2023. Record-breaking demand saw it amass 2,319 gross orders over the past 12 months, resulting in a net total of 2,094. This includes more than 1,800 A320 family single-aisle jets and 300 A350 Family widebody aircraft. Only time will tell if the European firm has bitten off more than it can chew.

How Many Aircraft Did Boeing Deliver in 2023?

Earlier this week, Boeing posted its own delivery figures. While up on 2022, they trailed Airbus by some margin. The U.S. firm handed over 528 aircraft during 2023:

396 Boeing 737s

One Boeing 747

32 Boeing 767s

26 Boeing 777s

73 Boeing 787s

Boeing is due to provide more information with its fourth-quarter financial results on January 31. Meanwhile, Airbus’ full-year financials are due on February 15. Skift and Airline Weekly will have full coverage of both company’s announcements.

“Travel is Back!”

In November, Airbus CEO, Guillaume Faury reiterated his belief that Airbus would reach its year-end goal of “around 720” aircraft. In reality, the target was comfortably met, with more than 100 planes handed over in December alone.

The chief executive described 2023 as a “landmark year” for the firm’s commercial aircraft business. In reference to the chronic supply chain issues that have plagued the sector, he highlighted “increased flexibility and capability of [its] global industrial system” as one of the factors that helped boost efficiency.

Christian Scherer, head of Airbus Commercial Aircraft cranked up the enthusiasm gauge one notch higher. He noted that the post-pandemic rebound in demand was even faster and stronger than predicted: “We originally anticipated aviation to recover sometime in the 2023-2025 timeframe, but what we saw in 2023 was, alongside the single-aisle market, widebody return much sooner than expected, and with vigor. We have never sold as many A320s or A350s in any given year, not to mention welcoming seven new customers for the A350-1000. Travel is back and there is serious momentum!”

As recent developments at Airbus and Boeing have shown in their own distinct ways, in the airline business winning orders is only the start of the battle. The really tricky part is timely delivery with quality execution. Planemakers on both sides of the Atlantic know that a growing line of profit-hungry airline customers is waiting."

Flexrotor is a small tactical unmanned aerial system designed for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance (ISTAR) missions at sea and over land.

""We are looking forward to welcoming Aerovel into the Airbus family. This strategic acquisition aligns with our vision to expand our UAS offering and respond to a growing customer demand worldwide for additional mission capabilities such as manned-unmanned teaming. Aerovel's expertise in autonomous flight technology will undoubtedly complement our UAS development with the VSR700, as well as the work that we have been doing to develop interoperability,” said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters.

""Joining forces with Airbus will allow us to scale innovation, accelerate our mission to advance unmanned aviation, and maintain our unwavering support for the US military and its allies. We are proud to become part of an organisation with a rich legacy of aerospace excellence and we look forward to leveraging our combined strengths to define the future of autonomous systems. It will also be a great tribute to our Founder and Chief Technology Officer, Tad McGeer, who has spent the last 30 years committed to delivering innovative unmanned products,” said Ali Dian, CEO of Aerovel.

The Flexrotor, a modern Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) Unmanned Aircraft with a maximum launch weight of 25 kg, has been designed for ISTAR missions for more than 12-14 hours in a typical operational configuration. It can integrate different types of payloads including an electro-optical system and advanced sensors to suit customers’ unique mission needs. With the ability to autonomously launch and recover from either land or sea requiring only a 12 by 12 ft. area for launch and recovery, the Flexrotor is ideal for expeditionary missions requiring minimal footprint. Through the support of the US Department of Defense (DoD), and contracted deployment in a variety of maritime security exercises, the Flexrotor is a mission-proven, force multiplier for operations in harsh, high-threat, GPS-denied environments. The Flexrotor can also be used for parapublic missions such as forest fire surveillance (providing firefighters with critical images day or night) and ice navigation (helping guide naval vessels through ice in the Arctic ocean).

Aerovel, based in Bingen, Washington, will remain a US-owned company and continue collaboration with the US DoD under Airbus’ Special Security Agreement (SSA).

The acquisition has been approved by the relevant bodies of both companies. It remains subject to regulatory approvals, as well as other customary conditions. Transaction closing is expected in 2024.

This centre is the first of its kind to cover, as a one-stop shop, the full range of activities from aircraft parking and storage to maintenance, upgrades, conversions, dismantling and recycling services for various aircraft types, as well as the controlled distribution of used parts from dismantling.

The Airbus Lifecycle Services Centre in Chengdu is certified by both the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC).

The Airbus Lifecycle Services Centre covers a surface area of 717,000 square metres and has a storage capacity of 125 aircraft. The site will progressively ramp up operations between now and 2025, directly employing up to 150 employees. The main buildings have obtained the LEED(1) (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification for their construction, which is a first step to reduce the environmental impacts of operations at the ALSC site.

“I’m glad to see the Airbus Lifecycle Services Centre enter into service in Chengdu,” said Cristina Aguilar, Airbus SVP Customer Services. “It echoes our purpose to pioneer sustainable aerospace and shows our approach to environmental responsibility across the entire aircraft lifecycle. Our service centre is a great example of Chinese-European cooperation in the development of the circular economy for the aviation industry.”

The Airbus Lifecycle Services Centre unites under one roof a joint venture between Airbus, Tarmac Aerosave and the city of Chengdu, along with the Airbus company Satair. Tarmac Aerosave brings its more than 15 years of proven expertise in efficient aircraft storage, dismantling and recycling to the project. Located in the same centre, Airbus company Satair will acquire ageing aircraft and trade and distribute the used parts to complete the full scope of lifecycle services. 75 percent of the aircraft stored in the centre are expected to fly again after storage and upgrade by the joint venture. The remaining aircraft will be dismantled with the unique Tarmac Aerosave process, recovering around 90 percent of the aircraft weight.

Note #1: Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a green building certification program used worldwide. Developed by the non-profit U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), it includes a set of rating systems for the design, construction, operation and maintenance of “green buildings”, homes and neighbourhoods. The LEED certification program aims to help building owners and operators be environmentally responsible and use resources efficiently.

Orders came from 179 customers in 47 countries. The Company delivered 346 helicopters in 2023, resulting in a preliminary 54% share of the civil and parapublic market.

“Airbus Helicopters’ order intake in 2023, with an increase bordering 10 percent in units in comparison to 2022, highlights its stable growth despite the ongoing global context of inflation and geopolitical instability,” said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters. “It’s also a testament to the versatility of our products on both the civil and military market and I’d like to thank our customers for continuing to entrust their critical missions to Airbus Helicopters,” he added.

2023 was a year of many firsts, with the first flight of the DisruptiveLab demonstrator featuring a new aerodynamic architecture aimed at reducing fuel consumption and the first flight of the NH90 Sea Tiger, the state-of-the-art anti-submarine warfare helicopter for the German Navy. The Company also welcomed a new member to the Airbus family when the Spanish Navy took delivery of their first H135 helicopters.

“Defence and security is one of Airbus Helicopters’ strategic priorities and we continue to innovate and develop to increase mission capabilities for our customers. The German armed forces signing the largest H145M contract with up to 82 light attack helicopters at the end of 2023 is testimony to that. On the development side, the H175M successfully performed flight demonstrations in the extreme hot and high conditions of the desert in Saudi Arabia while the VSR700 demonstrated its performance during sea trials from a French Navy multi-mission frigate. We also continue to expand our UAS portfolio with the acquisition of Aerovel which will allow us to offer our customers additional mission capabilities with manned-unmanned teaming,” continued Even.

Global support contracts and the HCare offering continued to prove popular in 2023 both with civil and military customers. 140 new helicopters were covered by “by-the-hour” contracts bringing the total to 2760 helicopters.

Innovation and sustainability remained a strong focus for the Company as it continued to invest in demonstrators aimed at advancing its decarbonisation roadmap and enhancing aviation safety. Airbus Helicopters’ FlightLab successfully tested an electric flight control system that allowed for a single pilot stick to replace all three conventional pilot controls, a first in the helicopter industry. Following these successful FBW flight trials, Airbus Helicopters, in partnership with Airbus UpNext, was able to test advanced autonomous features in order to simplify mission preparation and management, reduce helicopter pilot workload, and further increase safety.

“In the same way as the DisruptiveLab will be used to test hybridisation for single-engine helicopters, we unveiled the PioneerLab with the aim of testing hybridisation for twin-engine aircraft as well as introducing bio-based materials. We also started assembling CityAirbus NextGen in Donauwörth and wrapped up the year by performing the power-on. We also ramped up the use of SAF for our own development test flights, training, deliveries and ferry flights in Marignane and Donauwörth to 10% and we will continue to roll this out to our other sites in 2024,” continued Even.

Airbus’ 2023 full year financial results will be disclosed on 15 February 2024.

The world's first metal 3D printer for space is on its way to the ISS - Airbus,"Wed, 31 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDI0LTAxLXRoZS13b3JsZHMtZmlyc3QtbWV0YWwtM2QtcHJpbnRlci1mb3Itc3BhY2UtaXMtb24taXRzLXdheS10by10aGUtaXNz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The first metal 3D printer for space, developed by Airbus* for the European Space Agency (ESA), will soon be tested aboard the Columbus module of the International Space Station (ISS). It could be a real game changer for manufacturing in space and future missions to the Moon or Mars.

Additive Manufacturing (AM) is an industrial process that has opened up new ways of looking at how parts are designed. It has many uses from the day-to-day to the surprising: from simple repairs to bio-ink implants, from printing whole houses to producing spacecraft parts.

Metal 3D printing makes life easier for astronauts

There are already several plastic 3D printers on board the International Space Station (ISS), the first of which arrived in 2014. Astronauts have already used them to replace or repair plastic parts, since one of the major problems of everyday life in space is the supply of equipment, which can take months to arrive. But not everything can be made from plastic…

This logistical constraint will intensify on future Moon and Mars stations in the next few decades. Even though the raw material still needs to be launched, printing the part is still more efficient than transporting it whole up to its final destination.

Gwenaëlle Aridon, Airbus Space Assembly lead engineer, says: “The metal 3D printer will bring new on-orbit manufacturing capabilities, including the possibility to produce load-bearing structural parts that are more resilient than a plastic equivalent. Astronauts will be able to directly manufacture tools such as wrenches or mounting interfaces that could connect several parts together. The flexibility and rapid availability of 3D printing will greatly improve astronauts’ autonomy.”

The challenges of printing metal in space

While the process of 3D printing has been mastered on Earth, printing metal in space presents its own set of technical challenges. Sébastien Girault, metal 3D printer system engineer at Airbus, explains. “The first challenge with this technology demonstrator was size. On Earth, current metal 3D printers are installed in a minimum ten square metre laboratory, “ he says. “To create the prototype for the ISS, we had to shrink the printer to the size of a washing machine”. This miniaturisation is needed in order to fit inside the rack in which the printer will be housed on board the ISS’ Columbus Laboratory. “At this size, we can print parts with a volume of nine centimetres high and five centimetres wide,” Girault says.

The second challenge is safety: protecting the ISS from the aggressive printing environment caused by the laser and the heat it generates. The printer sits in a sealed metal box, which acts like a safe. The melting point of metal alloys compatible with this process can be far over 1,200°C degrees compared to around 200°C degrees for plastic, which implies drastic thermal control.

“Gravity management is also key, which is why we chose wire-based printing technology. The wire is independent of gravity unlike the powder-based system, which always has to fall to the ground,” Girault says.

Whether it's plastic or metal, fumes are emitted that have to be dealt with by filters and captured inside the machine so that they do not contaminate the air inside the ISS. “Safety and contamination are key drivers for us not only for the ISS, but for future use on the Moon,” Aridon says”.

Is metal printing suited to a microgravity environment?

This is one of the questions the team is setting out to answer. Two printers will be used for this experiment: the ‘flight model’ inside the ISS; and the ‘engineering model’ on Earth. The astronauts will print four samples in space, which will be sent back to Earth for analysis. The same specimens will be manufactured using the engineering model printer. “In order to evaluate the effects of microgravity, ESA and Danish Technical University will perform mechanical strength and bending tests and microstructural analysis on the parts made in space and compare them to the other specimens,” Girault explains.

First of the four metal 3D specimens to be printed on board the ISS

The Moon in our sights

Metal 3D printing on board the ISS will help improve understanding of the quality of metal printing in orbit and provide valuable insights into operating a metal 3D printer in space. Printing structural parts in space is an important step in preparing the technologies humankind will need for a sustained presence on the Moon.

“Increasing the level of maturity and automation of additive manufacturing in space could be a game changer for supporting life beyond Earth,” Aridon stresses. “Thinking beyond the ISS, the applications could be amazing. Imagine a metal printer using transformed regolith [moondust] or recycled materials to build a lunar base!”

This cooperation will provide better understanding of hydrogen aircraft concepts and operations, supply, infrastructures and refueling needs at airports in order to help develop this hydrogen aviation ecosystem in both countries. The work will also identify the pathways to select which airports will be transformed first to operate hydrogen-powered aircraft in both countries as well as the accompanying regulatory framework.

This is the first time that a feasibility study of this kind covers two countries and more than 50 airports. It reflects the partners’ shared ambition to use their respective expertise to support the decarbonisation of the aviation industry and to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

“Hydrogen stands out as a key enabler as we pioneer a sustainable aviation future.” said Guillaume Faury, CEO Airbus “Norway and Sweden are among the most demanding regions for aviation and have great potential for hydrogen production from renewable energy sources. I am very pleased to enter into this cooperation with partners fully engaged to take significant steps towards decarbonising aerospace. It fits perfectly with our strategy of deploying hydrogen aviation ecosystems in the most suitable parts of the world.”

Abraham Foss, CEO Avinor: “Hydrogen is emerging as a key energy carrier in future fossil free aviation. As the owner and operator of 43 airports across Norway, Avinor has been working on sustainability for many years already, and has taken a position as a driving force and facilitator for the green transition of Norwegian aviation. Our dialogue with Airbus concerning the decarbonization of aviation goes several years back and we are very happy to be able to announce this collaboration together with our good neighbors in Sweden. Norway, as well as Sweden, is well positioned to be an early mover in the introduction of hydrogen-powered aircraft. We look forward to contributing with our expertise as well as infrastructure to bring this important work forward.”

“As the world takes positive steps towards a more sustainable future, SAS’ commitment is to ensure that also coming generations can enjoy the benefits of seamless global connectivity.

By partnering with some of the strongest and most innovative players in the industry, we are assuming our responsibility to drive the transition towards achieving net-zero emissions. A journey that matters not just for SAS, but for the entire aviation industry,” says SAS’ President & CEO Anko van der Werff.

“We are very excited to be part of a larger partnership on the role of hydrogen in aviation together with Airbus, Avinor, SAS and Vattenfall. Swedavia, Avinor and SAS already have established successful collaborations in fossil-free aviation, and it is therefore exciting that Airbus, with its extensive knowledge of hydrogen-powered aircraft through its ZEROe initiative, and Vattenfall, with its expertise in electricity and energy production, are joining us in a more in-depth collaboration. Hydrogen is expected to gradually become an increasing part of the aviation industry's fuel mix in the future and will therefore have an increasing effect on the infrastructure and planning of our airports. This partnership is a major and important step towards fossil-free aviation in the Nordic region and will further strengthen Swedavia's role as a front-runner in fossil-free aviation, while at the same time taking another important step in the transition within the aviation industry,"" says Jonas Abrahamsson, Swedavia's president and CEO.

”We want to enable industry decarbonization. Aviation is a hard to abate industry where breaking away from fossil fuels is a huge challenge today. This cross border collaboration however demonstrates the willingness to bring about change. We look forward to contributing with expertise in electricity market development, electrical infrastructure, and hydrogen production in Sweden”, said Anna Borg, President and CEO, Vattenfall.

The use of hydrogen to power future aircraft is not only expected to significantly reduce aircraft emissions in the air, but could also help decarbonise air transport activities on the ground. In 2020, Airbus unveiled the first ZEROe concept with the ambition to bring to market the world's first hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft by 2035. The development of the corresponding technology bricks is now underway in a global Research & Technology network.

Airbus also launched the “Hydrogen Hub at Airports” programme to jumpstart research into infrastructure requirements and low-carbon airport operations, across the entire value chain. To date agreements have been signed with partners and airports in ten countries including France, Germany, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

“For our final dossier we had been compiling many documents during the first half of this year, encompassing Flight Safety, Flight Operations, Ground Operations, Technical Operations and Crew Training,” recalls Benoît Lemonnier, managing director of AiBT.

“We submitted it at the end of June 2023 following which we answered questions and fine-tuned over the summer. Of course, we didn't start from scratch, since we had built on the documentation and processes of ATI.”

Once the decisive audit by the authorities was passed successfully on the 26th of September, there remained one important ‘box to tick’ – the “Continuous Airworthiness and Maintenance Organisation” certificate (CAMO), which came at the beginning of November. With all these approvals successfully achieved, AiBT could at last really call itself an ‘airline’ and operate under its own AOC.

Staffing the right people in the right place

Benoît notes that becoming an airline not only entails documentation and compliance to regulation, it was also an effort to set up the company in terms of all kinds of resources.

“We staffed the right people in the right place. First our management was staffed at the beginning of the year until mid-2023. Then we recruited the necessary expert resources in the various fields of flight operations, dispatch crew planning, and also some new pilots. To date we have recruited almost 60 employees into the company – either through external recruitment or via internal job mobility within Airbus, mainly from ATI. We trained our people to be ready from ‘day one’.”

Operating as an autonomous freight airline

“We of course developed our facilities which included the new main office headquarters, close to Blagnac airport,” says Benoît. “We also secured our aircraft operational base at Francazal airport near to Toulouse, with two dedicated parking spots. From there our ground crews have been developing the capacity and capabilities to prepare the Beluga and its missions, especially in terms of loading and unloading the transport pallets as well as managing and maintaining the aircraft.”

The other major pillar of the fledgling operation was the official transfer of the BelugaSTs from ATI’s fleet register to AiBT’s (on lease from Airbus). Currently AiBT’s fleet includes three aircraft, with the fourth one due for induction in 2024.

“In short, we now have the aircraft, we have the people and we have the facilities – and the certificate. So now we can operate missions as our own airline!” enthuses Benoît.

Ramping-up operational experience

Initially, AiBT is starting with flights on the existing Airbus network. “It’s quite important that we don't start with long complex worldwide flights, but rather that our flying crews and ground teams gain experience with short flights contracted by ATI. These flights commenced in November for routes to Saint Nazaire, Hamburg, Bremen, Sevilla etc. This approach allows AiBT to test its internal procedures and to train everyone, especially the new pilots, before it resumes its core business of long-haul missions,” notes Benoît.

Dedicated head of flight operations

A key addition to AiBT’s leadership team is Olivier Schneider who joined in May this year as head of flight operations. He brings with him more than 20 years of experience with the Air France Group as a captain, instructor and most recently as head of flight operations of one of the group’s regional airline subsidiaries.

“The ramp-up of both the operations and the crew training and also the ground support team training is a big challenge,” he says. “We’re learning ‘on-the-fly’ since this type of operation is something brand new for many of the team. Moreover, even if Beluga has been flying from time to time on external long-haul missions, it’s one thing to plan and undertake one long mission, but it’s quite different to perform several of them in the same week.”

Olivier adds: “Another training challenge is in the Operation Control Centre – the ‘control tower’ of the airline – where we smoothly run the operation while training and qualifying two new dispatchers every two months. Our goal is to eventually operate the five Belugas at the same time around the world, which will be a challenge in terms of resources, anticipation and coordination.”

Expanding payload types carried

As the teams build up their experience initially on the short intra-Europe ‘hops’ between Airbus sites (which is also supporting Airbus Commercial’s ramp-up for A350 and Single Aisle programmes), a parallel focus will be for AiBT to expand the scope of certified payloads that will be required for the transportation needs of external customers.

“So far we’ve delivered payloads mainly for Airbus Helicopters and Airbus Defence and Space in 2022/2023 and we're going to expand our customer base in 2024,” predicts Benoit.

To accelerate this process, AiBT has forged an agreement with Airbus on further investment to certify the BelugaST to carry more types of helicopters, containers and aircraft engines. Having these certifications will really open a significant market, which is what AiBT ultimately targets.

“Later in 2024 we also plan to ramp-up with what we call ‘external flights’, usually long-haul missions,” says Benoît. “We want to achieve three missions per month of that kind in 2024 – on top of the existing missions with the BelugaST throughout Europe in support of ATI’s service for Airbus’ production system.”

Recruiting and training new Beluga pilots

Since the BelugaST is unique to Airbus, there is no immediate ‘ready qualified’ source of pilots on the external job market. Consequently, pilots of other types commonly operated would need to be brought in and trained-up to be type-rated on the Beluga – which takes some time.

To bridge this gap, AiBT has reached an agreement for 12 of ATI’s pilots to join AiBT as captains or first officers for up to three years. After this interim period, these pilots will return to ATI to fly the expanding fleet of brand new A330-200 BelugaXLs.

In parallel, AiBT is actively recruiting pilots from the external world – of which nine have already been inducted, contributing towards an eventual total requirement of around 36 pilots by 2026.

“We are mostly looking for pilots with some experience of flying A300s and A310s – a family which shares the same cockpit and systems as the Beluga,” notes Olivier. “However, there's nevertheless quite a long training path to be followed to become a first officer on BelugaST, then to be promoted to captain. And this is why we need this collaboration with the Airbus ex-ATI pilots who will accompany our development for up to three years.” AiBT is therefore fortunate to have forged a close relationship with the Airbus Training Center in Toulouse – aimed at being its official EASA-designated “Approved Training Organisation” – where AiBT pilots are able to use the A300/A310 full-flight simulator for type rating and for recurrent training and checks. Flying Beluga missions – an attractive and exciting challenge for aircrew… Notably, even pilots coming from regular freight carriers cannot simply slot into a Beluga operation, since the mission and flight profiles are so different – hence the new training and type-rating required. Nevertheless, Benoît and Olivier stress the attractiveness for external pilots to join the Airbus subsidiary, not only to work in a company with a leading brand like Airbus which offers various career-development opportunities, but also because flying the iconic Beluga and performing its missions is in itself an exciting challenge. For example, the Beluga fleet was built for the European network, whose sectors are around four hours maximum. For AiBT’s long haul missions, however, its crews will have to fly several ‘legs’ before reaching their destination. “That will be something new for many experienced long-haul aircrew who are used to flying from Europe to Singapore, in 13 hours from start to finish. Whereas with the Beluga we are talking about four legs spread over two days to get there,” explains Olivier.

Its pilots will also need to fly some missions at 20,000 ft at around Mach 0.7, versus the typical 35,000ft cruising altitude and Mach 0.8 speed of regular freighters. The reason for this is that certain payloads, especially helicopters, are not generally certified for exposure to altitudes of more than 20,000 ft – a constraint that needs to be maintained while they are being carried the Beluga’s unpressurised cargo hold. (In contrast, when carrying a space satellite payload the Beluga will cruise higher, since spacecraft are built to operate in the vacuum of space.) Furthermore, Belugas will experience varied weather conditions at lower cruise altitudes, which, by contrast, regular air freight aircraft would not encounter higher up at 35,000 ft.

Another difference versus a normal freighter mission, relates to the ground operation: The Beluga’s main cargo deck is quite high from the ground, so there's a lot of coordination needed and special crew to unload the payload at the destination – which is a key part of the operation requiring several hours to accomplish.

Summing-up, Olivier says: “Our goal is to have a fleet of five Belugas operating all around the world. To achieve this will be the culmination of several years of hard work. I really look forward to this day, and the thought of Airbus’ mythical Belugas flying over the world’s continents fills me with eager expectation. The market is here, we will do our best to achieve this!”"

Airbus said Jan. 29 it is now the sole owner of Airbus OneWeb Satellites (AOS) in Merritt Island, adjacent to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, which it has repurposed for other commercial and government customers.

Financial details were not disclosed.

In its peak, the eight-year-old facility’s semi-automated production line was producing two satellites daily for OneWeb’s first-generation broadband constellation.

The operator fully deployed the network in LEO last year, although global coverage has slipped to later in 2024 following delays with the ground segment.

AOS facilities have since been modified to accommodate Arrow, a satellite platform based on the 150-kilogram Eutelsat OneWeb spacecraft.

AOS has sold 30 Arrow-derived satellite buses to Loft Orbital, a San Francisco condosat operator that buys satellite buses from multiple vendors and outfits them with payloads flown on behalf of customers.

Airbus U.S. Space & Defense is also providing 58 upgraded Arrow450 satellites out of AOS for Northrop Grumman for the Space Development Agency Tranche 1 tracking and transport layers.

The factory was involved in work for the Blackjack LEO constellation, under a contract from Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency with Airbus U.S. Space & Defense, but DARPA downsized the project.

“We will continue mass producing small satellites for our customers and are excited for what the future holds for us on Florida’s Space Coast as we move forward,” said Robert Geckle, chair and CEO of Airbus U.S. Space & Defense.

Eutelsat Group, Eutelsat OneWeb’s parent company that also operates geostationary satellites, said the sale will help efforts to reduce debt.

Eutelsat OneWeb is currently looking for a manufacturer to build a second-generation LEO constellation it has estimated would cost around $4 billion.

Eutelsat Group spokesperson Joanna Darlington told SpaceNews Airbus will continue to be “considered with others as a potential supplier” following the Airbus OneWeb Satellites sale.

France-based Airbus also has satellite manufacturing facilities in Europe. The first six of OneWeb’s first-generation satellites were built in Toulouse, France."

Under the contract, TASL and Mahindra Aerostructures will manufacture metallic detail parts, components and assemblies for Airbus' A320neo, A330neo and A350 programmes. The two companies are already among more than 100 India-based suppliers that provide components and engineering and digital services for various Airbus programmes.

“Airbus has made ‘Make in India’ front and centre of its strategy in the country. Our ambition is not only to support the growth of the Indian commercial fleet but also to grow the complete aerospace ecosystem here – and that includes developing and strengthening manufacturing and engineering capabilities from our Indian partners,” said Rémi Maillard, President and Managing Director of Airbus India and South Asia. “Tata Advanced Systems and Mahindra Aerostructures already contribute to our aircraft programmes, and the latest contracts increase our cooperation with them.”

For Airbus, India is a strategic resource hub where the company is expanding its industrial footprint with aircraft assembly, component manufacturing, engineering design and development, MRO support, pilot and maintenance training as well as academic collaboration to foster human capital.

Today, every Airbus commercial aircraft has components and technologies made in India, including the A220 Escape Hatch Door and the Flap Track Beams for the A320neo and A330neo aircraft. Currently, the company’s procurement of components and services stands at about US$750 million every year, and the latest round of contracts will add significantly to this.

Airbus’ efforts to mature the wider Indian aerospace ecosystem includes the building of a Final Assembly Line for the C295 military aircraft in Vadodara under an industrial contract with TASL as well as training commercial pilots and maintenance crew.

Overview and timeline

The Airbus-BMW Group Quantum Mobility Quest is open to participants from research groups and companies worldwide. You can register now, and prepare to submit your entries prior to the April 30 deadline.

The challenge is organized into two rounds. In the first round, participants need to submit a well-documented concept proposal for one or more of the five challenges, described below. In the second and final round, the selected finalists in each use case will be asked to build out their solutions.

In November a jury composed of leading quantum computing researchers will team up with experts from Airbus, BMW Group, and AWS to evaluate submitted proposals and award one team with a €30,000 prize in each of the five challenges. The final winners will be announced in December.

To develop and test submissions, registered teams will use Amazon Braket – the managed quantum computing service of AWS – along with other AWS services. Braket provides a development environment to explore and build quantum algorithms, test them on quantum circuit simulators, and run them on different quantum computers, including devices from IonQ, OQC, QuEra, and Rigetti. AWS will offer credits for registered teams, upon request.

Airbus-BMW Group Quantum Computing Challenge use cases

The Airbus, BMW Group, and TQI teams have engaged the Amazon Quantum Solutions Lab to help design and support the competition. We worked closely with Airbus and BMW Group to define appropriate use cases for the competition, from the many computational challenges that exist inside complex engineering, manufacturing, and logistics domains, among others.

The team had a few key considerations for selecting the use cases. These included the feasibility of using a quantum or nature-inspired approach, the delta between existing classical computing solutions and potential future quantum-based approaches, and the practicality for a time-limited competition format. Based on these, the team developed the following five challenges that have the potential to drive real-world innovation for Airbus and BMW Group.

Participants are invited to select one or more problem statements, with four use cases in the forward track

enhanced corrosion inhibition with quantum simulation more sustainable supply chain with quantum optimization future automated mobility with quantum machine learning improved aerodynamics design with quantum solvers

There is one additional challenge in the reverse track: golden app. For this, candidates can put forward their own quantum technologies with the potential to develop native apps yet to be explored in the transportation sector.

Use case on quantum simulation: investigating quantum computing for corrosion inhibition

The mitigation of surface degradation processes is essential in prolonging the lifespan of Airbus and BMW Group products, improving operational efficiency, optimizing maintenance plans, and ultimately reducing costs. The degradation of the surface is initiated when mechanical damage in the coating exposes the underlying layer of aluminum to the surrounding atmosphere. In a smart coating material, an inhibitor is embedded within the coating matrix and, when damaged, forms a protective layer blocking the advancement of aluminum degradation.

The goal of this challenge is to model the process of adsorption of inhibitors on an aluminum surface and to understand the binding properties using quantum methods.

Use case on quantum optimization: towards an efficient and sustainable supply chain

Transport and logistics between manufacturing sites significantly contributes to the carbon-dioxide emissions and drives industrial efficiency and cost. In particular, the complexity of mobility products like vehicles and aircraft leads to highly complex supply chains. Airbus and BMW Group are both committed to reducing their CO2 emissions and to ensuring a reliable and efficient supply chain for their manufacturing processes.

The objective of this use case is to elaborate a quantum solution for a manufacturing supply chain problem respecting the driving application constraints.

Use case on quantum machine learning: augmenting generative AI for critical test scenario images

Future autonomous mobility will rely heavily on reliable and safe AI vision systems – it’s an essential pillar for autonomous vehicles and for automated landing of aircraft. To achieve the highest level of safety, it is necessary to have access to representative datasets of images specially for critical test scenarios. Those include lower visibility during night-time as well as adverse weather, intricate traffic patterns, and obstructions on runways. Quantum computers offer potential advantages for such challenges compared to their classical counterparts.

This problem statement focuses on the generation of images that encapsulate critical scenarios using quantum modeling techniques.

Use case on quantum solvers: predictive aeroacoustic and aerodynamic modeling

The ability to accurately predict aerodynamic flows and the propagation of sound waves are key capabilities in the mobility industry, with high relevance both for the automotive and aviation sector. This ability enables the development of high-quality products with extreme performance, like reducing noise pollution and lowering carbon emissions. In this context, it is paramount to solve partial differential equations describing multi-scale problems with many millions of degrees of freedom, limited by the available computational power of high performance computing (HPC) systems.

This problem statement focuses on finding most suitable quantum-based approaches to solve the relevant aerodynamic and acoustic equations.

Reverse track: the “golden app” – pushing the boundaries of quantum technology for mobility

Typical approaches nudge quantum technology to the most driving challenges which often are not quantum native, though. Airbus and BMW Group are both leading companies in the automotive and aerospace sector, respectively, and committed to embracing quantum technology early – as part of their innovation strategies.

In this challenge, we invite you to propose novel solutions (potentially the “golden app”) for both hardware and software where you see a large potential but where the relevance for the mobility sector still needs to be proven.

How to get started

To learn more and to register for the challenge, visit the Airbus BMW Group Quantum computing challenge website. Each use case is distinct and requires unique approaches, so we provide more detailed information on submission requirements for each of them. If you take up the Quantum Mobility Quest, don’t forget to request AWS Credits, so you can develop and test your approaches on the quantum computers available through Amazon Braket.

We look forward to your submissions!"
Airbus A350 Dimmable Windows: I Don't Mind Them! - One Mile at a Time,"Sat, 27 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL2luc2lnaHRzL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLWRpbW1hYmxlLXdpbmRvd3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As I wrote about some time ago, newly produced Airbus A350s feature dimmable windows, which is something that was previously only available on Boeing 787s. I’m not a fan of this feature on 787s, so I’ve been curious to see how the A350 dimmable windows compare. I finally had the chance to check them out, so wanted to report back.

Why I don’t like Boeing 787 dimmable windows

The Boeing 787 has had dimmable windows since the plane was launched, in lieu of traditional window shades. While the technology behind it is cool, personally this is a feature I’m not fond of, and it’s one of the reasons that I’ve historically preferred the A350 to the 787:

Many times the crew will just “lock” the window setting on dark for the entire flight, meaning there’s no way you can look outside

Even when in the darkest mode, I find that it’s still somewhat bright, and worst of all if you’re on the same side of the plane as the sun, it can get hot

The dimming happens slowly, which sometimes makes it tough to figure out if you’re controlling the window dimming feature correctly or not

Boeing 787 dimmable windows (on Oman Air)

Why Airbus A350 dimmable windows are better

In 2022, Airbus began introducing A350s with the “new production standard.” This includes several incremental improvements, including the jet being a bit lighter, and the cabin being a bit wider. Along with this, Airbus has also introduced dimmable windows on these jets.

I’ve been curious to test out the dimmable windows on these “new production standard” A350s. Now, my first flight on one of these planes was actually on a Starlux A350-900 from Los Angeles to Taipei. However, it was dark the entire way, so that doesn’t exactly help you with testing out this feature.

Well, I just flew an Air France A350-900 from New York to Paris, and that was operated by one of the carrier’s newest jets, with this feature. The great news is that based on my experience, the dimmable windows on the A350 actually, you know, dim. So when you get to the darkest setting, it’s just about as dark as it would be if you had a “traditional” window shade.

Just take a look at the below picture — the tail camera shows that it’s totally light out, while you can’t see anything through the window. This is significantly better than on the 787, and I also didn’t feel any warmth from outside.

The dimming process on the A350 is also really easy. There are simply two buttons — the left button makes the window lighter, while the right button makes the window darker. It’s that simple. You can tell what the current dimming setting is based on where the lines appear, as they’ll appear near the window that represents the setting (light or dark).

Then when you try to change the setting, there will be squares moving between the windows, indicating that a change is in motion. Once the process is complete, the lines will stop moving.

One thing to be aware of is that the process of making the window lighter or darker is very gradual. For example, I timed it, and it took around 90 seconds for the full change to occur. That’s not a big deal at all, of course, but if you just want to take a quick peek out the window and then make it dark again, that’s a three minute process.

But honestly, why would you make the window dark when you have a view like this?!?!?

Bottom line

I finally had the chance to experience the dimming technology on Airbus A350s. This is a feature you’ll find on newly produced A350s, and it matches the technology on Boeing 787s. While I’m not a huge fan of this technology in general, the A350 dimmable windows are considerably better than on the 787, as they actually get totally dark.

What do you make of the A350 dimmable windows?"
Airbus Beats Boeing to Win First Major Plane Deal of 2024 - Skift Travel News,"Tue, 09 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjQvMDEvMDkvYWlyYnVzLWJlYXRzLWJvZWluZy10by13aW4tZmlyc3QtbWFqb3ItcGxhbmUtZGVhbC1vZi0yMDI0L9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjQvMDEvMDkvYWlyYnVzLWJlYXRzLWJvZWluZy10by13aW4tZmlyc3QtbWFqb3ItcGxhbmUtZGVhbC1vZi0yMDI0L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With this latest order, Boeing has lost further ground to Airbus in the all-important long-haul market.

The first major airline deal of the year has been formally confirmed. Taipei-based EVA Air has finalized terms with Airbus for a new fleet of widebody and narrowbody planes. A total of 33 new aircraft will be joining the Taiwanese carrier, comprising 18 A350-1000s and 15 A321neos.

Although the deal has been in the pipeline since early November when the Star Alliance member referenced the order in a stock exchange filing, the closure of the contract remains significant.

EVA Air has long been a Boeing and Airbus customer; however, this latest development shifts the center of gravity towards the European manufacturer.

The list price of the transaction is estimated at $10.1 billion, although airlines usually get discounts on this official catalog rate.

Comments from Clay Sun, President of EVA Air are unlikely to make happy reading for Boeing. He said the airline conducted a “thorough evaluation of the various models in each market segment” before selecting “the most modern and fuel efficient types, that offer the highest levels of passenger comfort.” In other words, the U.S. firm didn’t make the cut on this occasion.

Airbus A350s to Replace Boeing 777s

While any new business on this scale will be welcomed by Airbus, it is the A350 part of the deal that will be particularly pleasing. EVA plans to use the twin-aisle jets to replace many of its existing Boeing 777-300ERs. The net result is that all three of Taiwan’s long-haul carriers – EVA Air, China Airlines, and Starlux Airlines – will soon be flying the A350 on their flagship routes, including to the United States.

To date, the A350 has secured over 1,000 orders from 60 customers, with more than 570 of the type currently in operation with 39 companies including Delta Air Lines and British Airways. Meanwhile, the A321neo has received more than 5,600 orders from 100+ customers since its 2016 launch.

While disappointing for Boeing, today’s news doesn’t represent a complete severing of ties between the company and EVA Air. An additional tranche of 787 Dreamliner airplanes is due to partly replace EVA’s outgoing Airbus A330s. These typically serve busy trunk routes within Asia, often linking regional capitals. As EVA doesn’t operate Boeing narrowbody jets, the deal can be chalked up as a neutral outcome on the single-aisle front.

The more troubling strategic question for Boeing is this – are delays to the company’s next-generation 777X airliner encouraging existing clients to defect to Airbus? With the current version of the 777 no longer commercially relevant and high-profile 777X launch customers growing impatient, expect Airbus’ A350 to gather more new buyers in the coming months."

The airline has opted for the Airbus option to have the delivery flight to Paris-Orly powered by a sustainable aviation fuel blend on board.

The new aircraft features 186 seats in a single class layout. Selected for its outstanding operational efficiency, reduced emissions and comfort, the A320neo will be deployed by Transavia France on its services on its domestic network as well as across its European and Mediterranean markets.

The introduction of its first A320neo aircraft marks the beginning of Transavia France' transition to become an all Airbus operator, powered by efficient A320neo Family aircraft. With its reduced fuel burn and emissions, the A320neo will play a key role in advancing the airline Group's sustainable development goals.

By incorporating new generation CFM International LEAP-1A engines and Sharklets, the A320neo brings a 50% noise footprint reduction and 20% fuel savings and CO 2 reduction compared to previous generation single-aisle aircraft, while improving passenger comfort in a wider single-aisle cabin.

The cabin features Airbus’ Airspace XL bins. The larger bins provide 40% more stowage space compared to conventional bins, for a more relaxed boarding. In addition, USB-C ports are available for passengers at each seat, and the latest lighting system enhances the overall passenger experience.

The A320neo Family is the world’s most popular single aisle having won nearly 9,800 orders from nearly 140 customers in all markets.

Airbus and Voyager finalize Starlab joint venture - SpaceNews,"Tue, 16 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXJidXMtYW5kLXZveWFnZXItZmluYWxpemUtc3RhcmxhYi1qb2ludC12ZW50dXJlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Voyager Space and Airbus Defence and Space have finalized a partnership to develop the Starlab commercial space station, seeking to win customers for it from both sides of the Atlantic.

The companies announced Jan. 9 that they completed the formation of Starlab Space LLC, the joint venture responsible for the design, construction and operation of the station. The companies announced plans to create the joint venture in August.

“This joint venture solidifies our unwavering commitment to reimagining the future of commercial space alongside Voyager, anchoring Starlab to European and American ambitions and pioneering the future of humanity in space,” said Jean-Marc Nasr, head of space systems at Airbus, in a statement.

The companies described the joint venture as a partnership that would leverage both technical and business competencies of the two companies. It is also designed to help win business from both NASA and European customers, like the European Space Agency, as the agencies transition from the International Space Station to commercial facilities like Starlab.

“If you look at the business case for Starlab, you discover very quickly that neither Europe nor the U.S. can do a space station on their own,” said Manfred Jaumann, vice president of low Earth orbit and suborbital programs at Airbus, during a session of the Space Tech Expo Europe conference in Bremen, Germany, in November. “You need partners.”

Voyager, he said, brought to the partnership expertise in commercialization. “The commercialization process in the U.S. is much more advanced” than in Europe, he argued. “They are years ahead of us.”

Airbus, he said, brought to the partnership technical expertise. That includes development of the large habitation module, made of stainless steel, that enables the station to be launched on a single flight of a heavy-lift rocket. “This is a complete game-changer when compared with ISS,” he said.

The companies, in addition to finalizing the joint venture, also completed the system definition review for Starlab. That keeps the program on track to be ready by late this decade, before the scheduled retirement of ISS in 2030.

In addition to the joint venture with Airbus, Voyager also announced in October a partnership with Northrop Grumman, which had been working on its own commercial space station concept. Northrop will provide its own technical support to Starlab and develop a version of its Cygnus cargo vehicle that can dock with Starlab.

As part of that agreement, Northrop terminated a funded Space Act Agreement with NASA for its commercial space station. NASA reallocated the remaining money on that agreement to other companies Jan. 5, including $57.5 million to Voyager Space for additional development milestones and work on the new Cygnus variant.

“Through our joint venture with Airbus, teaming agreements with Northrop Grumman and Hilton, and continued success in meeting critical milestones, Starlab is setting the new standard for commercial space,” Matthew Kuta, president of Voyager Space, said in a statement.

Starlab Space is a U.S. entity, allowing it to work directly with NASA and other government agencies. Voyager and Airbus said in the announcement that it would establish a “European affiliated joint venture” to serve ESA and other European entities. Airbus and Voyager signed a memorandum of understanding with ESA in November to study how Starlab could serve ESA’s needs after the retirement of the ISS.

Starlab Space separately announced Jan. 11 that Jim Bridenstine, the former NASA administrator, will join its board of directors."
"Airbus lands record orders in 2023, beats Boeing on deliveries - CNN","Thu, 11 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wMS8xMS9idXNpbmVzcy9haXJidXMtcmVjb3JkLWFubnVhbC1qZXQtb3JkZXJzL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAUtodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDI0LzAxLzExL2J1c2luZXNzL2FpcmJ1cy1yZWNvcmQtYW5udWFsLWpldC1vcmRlcnM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus reported record annual jet orders and confirmed an 11% rise in 2023 deliveries on Thursday, maintaining the top manufacturing spot against rival Boeing for a fifth year.

As airlines scrambled to renew fleets last year, Airbus said it had won 2,319 gross orders and 2,094 net orders after cancellations. Confirming a Reuters report, it said it delivered 735 airplanes, leaving its order backlog at 8,598.

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said the planemaker, which analysts say made a slow start to the year as it wrestled with tight supply chains, had seen “increased flexibility and capability” in its industrial system.

He added that he was confident Airbus would meet a delivery target of 75 A320 jets a month in 2026, with ten assembly lines active for the A320 family.

“The situation in the supply chain is still tense. It’s improving, it’s getting better, but we are also flying higher as we continue to ramp up in 2024,” Faury told a news conference.

Boeing, which is still recovering from a safety grounding of its 737 MAX followed by a spate of production problems, said this week it had delivered 528 aircraft in 2023 and booked 1,314 net new orders after allowing for cancellations.

Christian Scherer, who in January stepped up from the top sales job to become CEO of commercial aircraft, the core plane making business at Airbus, said aviation had recovered faster than expected from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Demand for wide-body jets was rebounding particularly sharply, he said, adding in a statement: “Travel is back and there is serious momentum.”

He added that making up for the backlog quickly was a priority for the European planemaker.

“The responsibility is to live up to this commitment to deliver a backlog of 8600 aircraft on time, on quality,” he told a press conference.

Boeing is under fresh scrutiny over production following a cabin blowout that prompted a partial new grounding of one type of 737 MAX. Analysts said this is also happening against a backdrop of lingering supply tensions across the industry."

Boeing was founded in 1916, just 13 years after the Wright brothers' first flight. It would be another half a century before Airbus came along.

Europe wanted to challenge America's aviation dominance by building its own company. The French, British, and German governments started planning in 1967 before Airbus was officially founded three years later.

After a challenging start, Airbus has now had more orders than Boeing for five consecutive years, with 2,319 in 2023 compared with 1,456 for the American company.

Here are five key moments that helped Airbus gain the upper hand.

1. Bernard Lathière's bold A300 bet

The A300 was not just the first Airbus plane, but also the world's first twin-engined widebody jet.

When it first took flight in 1972, all other double-aisle jets had three or four engines, like the Boeing 747.

But Airbus struggled to win orders and carried on despite not getting the 75 it said it needed to start making the plane.

Airbus owes much to a bold bet made by Bernard Lathière, its managing director from 1975 to 1985.

Eastern Air Lines had been a top US carrier, but by the late 1970s was struggling with big debts.

In 1977 Lathière agreed to lease Eastern four A300s for six months for nothing. In the 2014 documentary ""Airbus vs Boeing: The Jumbo Jet Race"" he said he was nearly fired for doing so.

It meant Airbus had a foothold on Boeing's home turf. Eastern then ordered 23 A300s for $778 million, pleased with its lower fuel consumption, per The Washington Post.

2. The fly-by-wire A320

Airbus didn't find real success until the advent of the single-aisle A320 in 1987.

As the first jet rolled out of the factory in Toulouse, France, it was christened by Prince Charles and Princess Diana — a sign that Airbus wasn't messing around.

But the A320's real genius was using fly-by-wire technology only found in fighter jets and Concorde until then.

It replaces mechanical flight controls with computer-controlled systems to process the pilots' input and is considered safer because there are fewer points of failure.

Plus it's cheaper for operators because computers are easier to fix, and fewer parts and lighter wires meant better fuel efficiency too.

The A320 went on to become the world's second-best-selling airliner, behind the Boeing 737.

3. Government subsidies

As Airbus started to become a threat to Boeing, it began to face more scrutiny.

In 1993, Bill Clinton provoked tensions as he visited Boeing's factory after it announced layoffs, the Post reported at the time. The president blamed Airbus for the American company's troubles and he criticized the billions in subsidies that Airbus received from European governments.

Airbus and the governments denied those claims, before a trade war ensued as both sides imposed tariffs on the other.

After the US held talks with the UK, France, Germany, and Spain in 2004, it filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization. The European Union also filed a tit-for-tat lawsuit accusing the US of giving unfair subsidies to Boeing, per Reuters.

The dispute took no less than 17 years to be resolved.

The WTO found that both Airbus and Boeing had illegally received billions in government subsidies, and permitted tariffs to be imposed as a consequence. A truce was struck in 2021 to end the tariffs.

4. The A320neo

Airbus introduced the next generation of its popular short-haul A320 jet, and it was quick to make a mark.

The neo — ""new engine option"" — was so popular because it was quieter, more fuel efficient, and therefore cheaper for airlines to operate.

Its large winglets, more than 7 feet high, also helped reduce fuel burn. Airbus says it cut fuel costs by a fifth compared to previous models.

The A320neo set records at the 2011 Paris Air Show, winning 667 orders worth $60 billion.

That left Boeing desperate to catch up, so it accelerated development of the 737 Max — the fourth generation of its narrow-body jet.

5. 737 Max groundings

The more fuel-efficient engines that Boeing needed to compete with the neo posed a design problem for a plane that first flew in the 1960s. Because they were larger, they didn't fit underneath the wings of the plane.

Boeing decided to move the engines forward and upwards instead — but this affected the 737's aerodynamics by making it more likely to pitch upwards in some scenarios.

As a remedy, a software called MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System) that automatically pushed the nose down if the ""angle of attack"" was too steep.

But it took data from only one of two sensors, which malfunctioned in the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes .

It wasn't long before regulators around the world grounded the 737 Max. Boeing's newest jet didn't fly again for 20 months — the longest period ever for an American airliner.

In 2019, Airbus beat Boeing on plane orders for the first time since the A320neo took the Paris Air Show by storm eight years earlier.

The European company has kept the crown since then, and even broke records last year.

As Boeing and its 737 Max face more scrutiny following the Alaska Airlines blowout, Airbus seems likely to keep flying high."
Airbus partners with CSIR-Indian Institute of Petroleum to foster Sustainable Aviation Fuel development in India; MoU ... - Airbus,"Fri, 19 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyNC0wMS1haXJidXMtcGFydG5lcnMtd2l0aC1jc2lyLWluZGlhbi1pbnN0aXR1dGUtb2YtcGV0cm9sZXVtLXRvLWZvc3RlctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hyderabad, 19 January 2024: Airbus and the CSIR-Indian Institute of Petroleum (CSIR-IIP) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to develop new technology pathways as well as test and qualify indigenous Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in India.

The collaboration will address the Indian aerospace industry’s decarbonisation ambitions by supporting SAF production and commercialisation, using a new HEFA technology pathway and locally sourced feedstocks. Both entities will work jointly on technical assessment, approvals, market access, and sustainability accreditation efforts for the production of SAF. The MoU was signed with the active support and guidance from the office of the Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India, Prof. Ajay Sood.

""My office is focused on facilitating local industry players to industrialise indigenous emerging technologies and other innovations that aim to make a social impact. Decarbonisation is a key goal of the aviation industry and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a viable, here-and-now solution that requires scaling-up. The collaboration between CSIR-IIP and Airbus will address that potential and help shape India as a SAF factory of the world,” said Prof Ajay Sood, Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India.

“SAF is one of the main pillars of Airbus’ decarbonisation roadmap. We believe that India has the potential to become a global SAF production hub leveraging feedstock availability, local talent and technological expertise as well as India’s ability to scale up solutions. Airbus is, therefore, committed to developing and advancing that potential. The MoU with CSIR-IIP is a major step in our ambition to decarbonise the aviation sector,” said Rémi Maillard, President and Managing Director, Airbus India and South Asia.

“The aviation sector has strengthened its sectoral CO2 reduction targets in order to reach Net-Zero carbon emission by 2050. SAF, including the one developed by CSIR-IIP, will act as the measure with the biggest impact on the industry’s decarbonisation effort. The biggest challenge in the rise of SAF uptake lies in (i) the ramp up of production and (ii) addressing the cost differential between SAF and conventional jet fuel. Both CSIR-IIP and Airbus are happy to jointly collaborate, communicate and promote SAF usage as a key solution to reduce aviation’s emissions,” said Dr. Harender Singh Bisht, Director, CSIR-IIP.

Today, all Airbus aircraft are certified to fly on 50% SAF blend, with a goal to achieve the capability to fly up to 100% SAF by 2030. Airbus and CSIR-IIP will contribute to increasing this up to 100% in order to remove the need to use fossil fuels. While CSIR-IIP will study fuel properties under the new pathway and the impact on aircraft systems and the environment, Airbus will provide guidance on the new fuels evaluation process, sharing fuel testing and aircraft systems knowledge."
Global aircraft order backlog hits 13 years. Airbus beats Boeing on key metrics | CAPA - CAPA - Centre for Aviation,"Thu, 11 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL2NlbnRyZWZvcmF2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS9hbmFseXNpcy9yZXBvcnRzL2dsb2JhbC1haXJjcmFmdC1vcmRlci1iYWNrbG9nLWhpdHMtMTMteWVhcnMtYWlyYnVzLWJlYXRzLWJvZWluZy1vbi1rZXktbWV0cmljcy02NzI0NzDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

Global deliveries of passenger aircraft in 2023 were 26% below 2018's record high, and set the clock back a decade to 2012/2013 levels.

The global order backlog reached a record high in 2023 and was equivalent to 12.6 years of production.

Airbus' 2023 target of 720 deliveries and Boeing's 445 are likely to have been met, but Airbus deliveries are back to 2017 levels, whereas Boeing's are back to 2010.

Airbus has beaten Boeing on deliveries since 2019, and on installed fleet since 2020.

Both have record high order backlogs, but Airbus is ahead in absolute terms. Airbus' 2023 backlog is 11.7 years of production and Boeing's was 12.8 years.

Global deliveries of passenger aircraft in 2023 were 26% below 2018's record high…

According to the CAPA - Centre for Aviation Fleet Database, global deliveries of commercial passenger aircraft recovered to 1,263 in 2023, from 1,157 in 2022.

These numbers represent a noticeable uptick from 953 in 2021, and just 719 in 2020, which was the first COVID-19 year and recorded the lowest number since 2006.

However, the 2023 total was still 2% below the pre-pandemic number of 1,284 in 2019 - a year that was adversely affected by the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX - and 26% lower than the record high of 1,698 deliveries in 2018.

…and set the clock back a decade

Annual deliveries typically oscillate with the economic cycle, but the pattern of recent years has not been typical.

In most of the downturns of recent decades, global deliveries have recovered to exceed the pre-downturn peak by two to five years after that peak.

This pattern would have meant deliveries rising above the 2018 total by 2023 or earlier, but, as noted, the number was still a long way short in 2023.

Indeed, the 2023 deliveries total of 1,263 was between the 2012 and 2013 figures - in effect, setting the clock back a decade.

Of course, the COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact. However, it is not the only factor, especially as COVID-19 restrictions are now well in the past.

The ongoing problem is the aviation supply chain.

The global order backlog reached a record high in 2023…

The global order backlog of passenger aircraft reached a record year-end level of 15,933 at the end of 2023.

This high number of outstanding orders reflects both strong demand for aircraft and the low production rates of recent years.

…and was equivalent to 12.6 years of production

Using 2023 delivery numbers to calibrate this against annual production, the orders backlog was equivalent to 12.6 years of production at the end of 2023. With the exception of the COVID-19 crisis years of 2020 and 2021, this was a record high for this measure.

Before the pandemic, the global backlog had been below 10 years of production throughout the 21st century.

Airbus' 2023 target of 720 deliveries and Boeing's 445 are likely to have been met…

The world's two leading commercial aircraft manufacturers, Airbus and Boeing, have both experienced supply chain challenges in the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.

However - Boeing's pain started earlier, before COVID-19, with the MAX grounding in 2019, and has been greater since.

Final delivery numbers for 2023 have not yet been confirmed by the two airframers. However, they are both likely to have achieved, or exceeded, their targets for the year.

These were 445 for Boeing (375 narrowbodies and 70 widebodies) and 720 for Airbus.

…but Airbus deliveries are back to 2017 levels…

For Airbus, this 2023 number would be the third successive increase from the low of 566 deliveries of 2020, but still 17% below its 2019 pre-COVID-19 peak of 863.

It would be in line with Airbus' 2017 deliveries, six years earlier.

…while Boeing's are back to 2010

For Boeing, the 2023 number would be considerably above its 2020 low of 157, but below the 480 deliveries it achieved in 2022.

Moreover, it would be 45% below its record high of 806 deliveries in 2018 and similar to its 2010 total, which was 13 years ago.

Airbus has beaten Boeing on deliveries every year since 2019

Airbus has delivered more aircraft than Boeing every year since 2019, when the MAX-8 delivery programme was interrupted. Before that, Boeing had outdelivered Airbus every year from 2012 to 2018, yet Airbus led in annual deliveries between 2003 and 2011.

Nevertheless, while the leadership of annual deliveries has changed fairly often over the years, the scale of Airbus' leadership in recent years is striking.

Boeing trailed Airbus on deliveries by 38% in 2023, and by 47% cumulatively across 2019 to 2023.

Airbus' installed fleet has been bigger than Boeing's since 2020

According to the CAPA - Centre for Aviation Fleet Database, Airbus overtook Boeing on installed fleet numbers (the total number of aircraft in service and parked) in 2020, when it reached 10,838, versus its rival's 10,824.

At the end of 2023 Airbus' current fleet was up at 12,261 aircraft, which was an increase of 16% from 2019.

Boeing's was 11,013 - down by 1% from its fleet at the end of 2019, and 10% smaller than the Airbus 2023 fleet.

Both have record high order backlogs, but Airbus is ahead

Both of the two leading manufacturers had a record high order backlog at the end of 2023.

However, the Airbus backlog was 12% above its previous high in 2018, but Boeing's was only level with its previous high (also in 2018).

Airbus' order year-end backlog has been bigger than Boeing's every year this century. At the end of 2023 Airbus had 8,413 outstanding orders, compared with Boeing's 5,702.

Boeing's backlog was 32% smaller than Airbus', a percentage only exceeded in the COVID-19 years of 2020 and 2021.

Airbus' 2023 backlog is 11.7 years of production…

For Airbus, the 2023 year-end backlog represented 11.7 years of production (at 2023 delivery rates). This figure was only exceeded once: in 2020 (when it was 12.7 years).

However, while the trend is upward relative to pre-COVID-19, Airbus' backlog is not vastly higher than the range of 9-11 years during much of the decade before the COVID-19 pandemic.

…and Boeing's was 12.8 years

Boeing's backlog was 12.8 years of production, lower than in the period 2019 to 2021, when the pandemic distorted the figures (it spiked up to 29.6 years in 2020).

Nevertheless, this was much higher than the range of 7-8 years in the decade before that.

The increase has more to do with low delivery rates than high order numbers.

Airbus and Boeing*: number of years of production in the aircraft order backlog, 2000 to 2023*

The backlog is set to remain historically high for some time

The recent grounding of Boeing 737 MAX-9s in certain configurations follows other fuselage manufacturing hitches at Boeing and its key supplier Spirit AeroSystems.

Supply chain challenges have also hit Airbus and Embraer - not least because of problems at the engine supplier Pratt & Whitney.

The 2019 grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX-8 programme was the most high profile problem of recent years, and it continued into the early months of the COVID-19 crisis.

In the recovery from the pandemic, labour shortages and supply chain constraints in both airframe and engine manufacture have further tested aviation's ability to produce commercial aircraft on time.

As Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary told The Financial Times (9-Jan-2024): ""I think that both Airbus and Boeing, certainly Boeing, need to significantly improve quality control.""

Even if they manage to do this quickly, supply chain problems seem set to continue well into 2024. Increased production rates will help to reduce the global aircraft order backlog from its level of almost 13 years at the end of 2023.

However, it will likely be a long time before the backlog drops back below 10 years, where it was until 2019."

Airbus Helicopters Adds Aerovel to Unmanned Aerial System Portfolio - Defense & Security Monitor,"Tue, 16 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vZHNtLmZvcmVjYXN0aW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC5jb20vMjAyNC8wMS8xNi9haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtYWRkcy1hZXJvdmVsLXRvLXVubWFubmVkLWFlcmlhbC1zeXN0ZW0tcG9ydGZvbGlvL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters has agreed to acquire Aerovel and its signature Flexrotor system to bolster its unmanned aerial capabilities. This strategic move bolsters Airbus’ presence in the tactical UAS market, offering a versatile tool for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR) missions.

This acquisition aligns with Airbus’ vision for a future where manned and unmanned aerial vehicles work together seamlessly. Aerovel’s expertise in autonomous flight technology will further fuel Airbus’ development of existing systems like the VSR700 and their interoperability efforts.

“This strategic acquisition aligns with our vision to expand our UAS offering and respond to a growing customer demand worldwide for additional mission capabilities such as manned-unmanned teaming,” said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters.

The Flexrotor, a modern Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) Unmanned Aircraft with a maximum launch weight of 25 kg, has been designed for ISTAR missions for more than 12-14 hours in a typical operational configuration. It can integrate different types of payloads including an electro-optical system and advanced sensors to suit customers’ unique mission needs.

The system has been successfully deployed in maritime security exercises thanks to its ability to autonomously launch and recover from either land or sea requiring only a 12 by 12 ft. area. The Flexrotor can also be used for parapublic missions such as forest fire surveillance (providing firefighters with critical images day or night) and ice navigation (helping guide naval vessels through ice in the Arctic ocean).

Aerovel, based in Bingen, Washington, will remain a US-owned company and continue collaboration with the US DoD under Airbus’ Special Security Agreement (SSA).

The acquisition has been approved by both companies and is expected to close late in 2024. Terms of the agreement were not announced.

Airbus Helicopters Looks to Expand UAS Portfolio with Acquisition - FLYING,"Tue, 16 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZseWluZ21hZy5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLWxvb2tzLXRvLWV4cGFuZC11YXMtcG9ydGZvbGlvLXdpdGgtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus, a top manufacturer of commercial jets, is looking to expand its uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) portfolio.

The French OEM on Monday announced its intent to acquire Aerovel, manufacturer of the Flexrotor tactical drone, through its subsidiary Airbus Helicopters. The drone—designed for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR)—is expected to join Airbus’ UAS roster by the end of the year, the manufacturer said, pending regulatory approval.

Flexrotor is a Group 2 small tactical UAS with vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capability, built for ISTAR operations for the U.S. and its allies over land or sea, day or night. It will join Airbus’ fleet of high endurance uncrewed aircraft, such as the self-flying VSR700 helicopter or Eurodrone. Aerovel will remain an American-owned company and work with the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) under Airbus’ Special Security Agreement.

The planned transaction follows the addition of a dedicated business line for military UAS by Airbus U.S. Space & Defense, which aims to deploy the aircraft for the DOD. The expansion was announced in November.

“This strategic acquisition aligns with our vision to expand our UAS offering and respond to a growing customer demand worldwide for additional mission capabilities such as manned-unmanned teaming,” said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters. “Aerovel’s expertise in autonomous flight technology will undoubtedly complement our UAS development with the VSR700, as well as the work that we have been doing to develop interoperability.”

According to Aerovel, Flexrotor combines compact size, heavy payload capacity, long range, and autonomy. It’s designed to meet the rigor of DOD specifications, capable of protecting military bases through threat detection and real-time imagery, for example. But it’s also meant to be cost-effective for commercial markets, which could deploy it for security or law enforcement applications.

Flexrotor is powered by a 28 cubic centimeter, two-stroke engine. The high-endurance drone can fly autonomously for more than 30 hours or up to 1,100 nm, reaching a top level speed of 77 knots. At its max launch weight of 55 pounds, it can cruise in fixed-wing mode at 21,000 feet agl. And crucially, its ability to take off and land vertically means it requires only a 12-by-12-foot space for launch and recovery.

The UAS uses a steerable, zoomable imaging turret with cameras to perform searches and collect video for real time or later viewing. In addition, Flexrotor is payload agnostic, allowing users to swap out certain sensors or other components. It can also communicate with receivers nearly 75 miles away and be assembled or stored in minutes, making it a flexible option for customers.

Though it’s designed for ISTAR missions and is backed by the DOD, Flexrotor is malleable enough to take on semi-public missions, such as tracking forest fires or guiding ships through ice in the Arctic Ocean.

“Joining forces with Airbus will allow us to scale innovation, accelerate our mission to advance unmanned aviation, and maintain our unwavering support for the U.S. military and its allies,” said Ali Dian, CEO of Aerovel. “We are proud to become part of an organization with a rich legacy of aerospace excellence and we look forward to leveraging our combined strengths to define the future of autonomous systems.”

Aerovel’s versatile UAS will join Airbus’ existing portfolio of uncrewed products, which is steadily growing.

SIRTAP, the company’s high-end tactical UAS for civil and military use cases, was recently picked by the Spanish Ministry of Defense to bolster the country’s armed forces. It ordered a total of nine systems and two simulators, with a prototype maiden flight planned for 2025.

Airbus also develops Eurodrone, which it bills as the first UAS built to fly in nonsegregated airspace. Eurodrone—a joint project between the governments of Germany, France, Spain, and Italy under the Organization for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR)—will carry out defense missions in civil airspace. Dassault Aviation and Leonardo are also involved in development.

Both SIRTAP and Eurodrone will be part of the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) project, which is a multinational collaboration to replace existing combat systems (including Airbus’ Eurofighter) with new technology by 2040. FCAS will be built around next-generation fighter jets, which will communicate with uncrewed remote carriers using a data platform called the Combat Cloud.

Airbus is co-leading the entire program, spearheading vehicle development for the remote carriers and data platform. The company will use its A400M mothership and A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) to deploy up to 50 remote carriers at once, helping them communicate with crewed aircraft using Combat Cloud. It’s also developing Manned-Unmanned Teaming software, which is designed to coordinate crewed and uncrewed platforms.

Beyond its FCAS projects, Airbus produces the VSR700 and Zephyr, a fixed-wing, uncrewed high-altitude platform station (HAPS). Zephyr can fly in the stratosphere for months at a time. In 2022, it surpassed all known endurance records for a UAS of its class during a 64-day, 30,000 nm flight.

In addition, Airbus produces a few small tactical UAS: the Aliaca for coastal surveillance, the DVF 2000ER for heavy endurance, and the CAPA-X for all kinds of military missions. It also builds target drones and simulators for military training and offers DeckFinder, a software that guides drones to safe landings.

Beyond UAS, Airbus is exploring other emerging forms of aviation. On Tuesday, for example, the company announced it successfully powered up ZEROe—a hydrogen propulsion system for its electric concept aircraft—in full for the first time. Earlier in the month, it finalized a joint venture to design, build, and operate the Starlab commercial space station.

At the same time, the manufacturer continues to set the bar for traditional aviation. Last week, it revealed it secured a company record 2,094 aircraft orders in 2023, topping rival Boeing in that metric for the fifth consecutive year.

Airbus Looks to Acquire Atos Cybersecurity Unit for Nearly $2 Billion - Dark Reading,"Thu, 04 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhcmtyZWFkaW5nLmNvbS9pY3Mtb3Qtc2VjdXJpdHkvYWlyYnVzLWFjcXVpcmUtYXRvcy1jeWJlcnNlY3VyaXR5LXVuaXQtMi1iaWxsaW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aerospace giant Airbus and French IT services company Atos are opening negotiations for a potential sale of Atos' Big Data and Security (BDS) business.

Following a stock-boosting Dec. 15 leak to Reuters, in a Jan. 3 market update, Atos revealed that it had, in fact, received two letters of interest in BDS, with Airbus' encompassing the entire business at a valuation between €1.5 and 1.8 billion (around $1.65 to $2 billion). The offer is nonbinding, and the talks are preliminary.

Any future deal will be long in the making. Airbus has been eyeing Atos' cybersecurity arm since at least March 2022, having previously made an offer for a 29.9% stake in Atos parent division Evidian before abandoning the plan. At the time, Atos wrote that ""combining Airbus' capabilities with Evidian's global leading position in managed security services and supercomputing would create a unique European actor in cybersecurity solutions and in the digitalization of the defense sector, public safety and critical national infrastructure.""

An Airbus spokesperson confirmed that the company has made moves to acquire Atos's BDS business via a ""non-binding proposal.""

""Discussions are at an early stage and remain subject to due diligence. There can be no certainty that they will result in any agreement or transaction,"" the spokesperson said in a statement provided to Dark Reading. ""The acquisition of BDS could significantly accelerate the digital transformation of Airbus, enhance the Company’s defense and security portfolio with strong capabilities in cyber, advanced computing and artificial intelligence, and support Airbus’ decarbonization roadmap.""

The Need for Custom Aviation Security

""This potential M&A deal demonstrates the criticality of developing cybersecurity solutions and bridging the needed gap between aviation and general enterprise industries,"" says Avi Tenenbaum, CEO of Cyviation, a commercial airline cybersecurity company. But he questions whether general cybersecurity can get the job done for an organization in such a specialized industry.

""Atos' cyber division is addressing general IT and not specific aircraft-related cybersecurity solutions. Unique solutions addressing cybersecurity needs in aircraft and fleets will be needed as attack events intensify and get closer and closer to the aircraft,"" he stresses.

Indeed, Airbus has already suffered its share of security lapses in recent years, not uncommon to the industry as a whole, leading some to put a brighter spotlight on this most safety-critical industry.

""There is cyber risk across the entire aviation supply chain, from the systems and services used by airport security to the communication networks between airplanes and air traffic control,"" explains Marty Edwards, VP of OT security at Tenable. ""As aviation embraces digital transformation, the interconnected nature of these systems increases the attack surface, demanding stringent cybersecurity measures.""

In the US, one development aimed at tackling the specifics of aviation security is the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) brand new set of requirements for airport and aircraft operators. In the EU, there's Implementing Regulation 2023/203, a framework for managing information security risks in aviation, set to take effect in 2025-26. According to Tenenbaum, 2023/203 in particular ""is likely to prompt fast adoption of cyber resilience measures by industry players, including the airlines."""

United’s order, which Kirby said has not been canceled, includes 277 of the aircraft along with ""an additional 200 auctions for Max 10 aircraft.""

Bloomberg News on Friday reported that Airbus was seeking to buy back A321neo positions from the jet market in order to be able to construct a proposal should there be an opening.

Trade publication Air Insight reported Airbus and United were in talks.

UNITED AIRLINES PROJECTS 1ST-QUARTER LOSS FROM BOEING 737 MAX 9 GROUNDING

Boeing has faced scrutiny in the wake of the door plug of a 737 Max 9 jet flown by Alaska Airlines falling off while carrying passengers earlier in the month.

The incident led to a temporary grounding of 171 Max 9 planes, all of which had door plugs.

""Our long-term focus is on improving our quality so that we can regain the confidence of our customers, our regulator and the flying public,"" Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Stan Deal said Friday. ""We are deeply sorry for the significant disruption and frustration for our customers, some of whom have been publicly and unfairly criticized.""

Airbus said that it earned 2,319 gross orders and 2,094 net orders (post cancellations) in 2023. Meanwhile, deliveries rose 11% annually to reach 735 airplanes, surpassing its targeted deliveries of 720 jets.

Airbus designs, manufactures, and provides aerospace products, space, and related services. It is one of the largest commercial aircraft manufacturers in the world. AIR shares have gained 25.5% in the past year.

Airbus’ Stellar Performance in 2023

Airbus has maintained the number-one spot as the top jet manufacturer in the world for the fifth consecutive year, leaving rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) behind. Airline companies have witnessed a stupendous surge in travel post-pandemic, pushing them to order more jets to renew their fleet. Airbus has repeatedly warned of supply challenges in the coming years. With an order backlog of 8,598 jets, Airbus is sold out for this decade for single-aisle jets and up to 2028 for wide-body jets.

Talking about the company’s performance, Christian Scherer, the CEO of the commercial aircraft business, said that travel demand picked up faster than expected. He is committed to delivering the backlog on time and with consistent quality. Moreover, Scherer said that the company would begin deliveries for Airbus’ new and longest-range single-aisle jet, the A321XLR, in the second quarter of this year.

Despite meeting record-high targets, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury noted that the company is still far from its 2019 delivery levels of 870 planes. Faury does not see Airbus meeting those highs any time soon. In the meantime, Faury acknowledged the “increased flexibility and capability” in Airbus’ industrial system and said that the company will try to meet the target of manufacturing 75 A320neo family jets each month by 2026.

Is Airbus a Buy Right Now?

Following Airbus’ solid performance, two five-star analysts have given contrasting views on the stock. Encouraged by Airbus’ performance, Jefferies analyst Chloe Lemaire reiterated his Buy rating on AIR stock with a price target of €150.00 (4.3% upside).

At the same time, RBC Capital analyst Kenneth Herbert maintained a Hold rating on AIR stock with a price target of €140.00 (2.7% downside).

AIR stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on TipRanks based on seven Buys, four Holds, and two Sell ratings. The Airbus Group SE share price forecast of €147.83 implies 2.8% upside potential from current levels.

Flexrotor, a Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) Unmanned Aircraft with a 25 kg maximum launch weight, has ISTAR capabilities, operating for 12-14 hours in a typical configuration. Its versatility is evident in its ability to integrate various payloads, including electro-optical systems and advanced sensors, catering to unique mission requirements.

Ali Dian, CEO of Aerovel, added, “Joining forces with Airbus will allow us to scale innovation, accelerate our mission to advance unmanned aviation, and maintain our unwavering support for the US military and its allies.”

In 2021, Aerovel revealed reliability results for its latest variant of the Flexrotor during demonstrations for the United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM). They were designed to meet the stringent requirements of the US Department of Defense.

Flexrotor’s mission-proven track record, supported by the US Department of Defense, positions it as a force multiplier for operations in challenging environments.

The acquisition ensures that Aerovel, based in Bingen, Washington, remains a US-owned company, continuing collaboration with the US Department of Defense under Airbus’ Special Security Agreement. The transaction, approved by both companies, awaits regulatory clearance and is expected to close in 2024, heralding a new era in unmanned aviation for Airbus Helicopters."

Under this five-year contract, Heligo will benefit from Airbus’ HCare Initial program, which will give the operator the freedom to replace scheduled and unscheduled components within 24 hours and pay a fixed rate per hour of helicopter flown. This will help Heligo to bring down their maintenance costs and the need to keep a regular inventory, thereby providing them with enhanced fleet availability for streamlined operations.

“We are proud to be the first operator to offer a fleet of Airbus Helicopters' 5-bladed H145 to ONGC for offshore operations in India. Once these helicopters are delivered this year, Heligo will have the largest H145 fleet in India serving both offshore and onshore missions. The H145 is a modern, multi-role helicopter which is suited for Indian conditions, offering exceptional performance and operational economics,"" said Nayan Jagjivan, Chairman, Heligo Charters Private Limited.

“We congratulate the Heligo team for being awarded the recent offshore contract with the H145s. This HCare Initial by-the-hour contract that we have just signed with Heligo for their H145 fleet will ensure efficient operations for these helicopters and their maximum availability. At Airbus, we believe in providing the best combination of support and services to our customers and we are proud of our long association with Heligo. This is Airbus Helicopters’ largest By-the-Hour contract with an Indian operator,” said Sunny Guglani, Head of Airbus Helicopters, Airbus India and South Asia.

The H145 is the latest member of the company’s twin-engine rotorcraft product range – with designed-in mission capability and flexibility, especially in high and hot operating conditions. Compact in size, this helicopter’s small footprint and large, flexible cabin enables maneuvering in complex environments, such as oil and gas helidecks.

HCare is Airbus Helicopters’ comprehensive services offer, providing superior customer service support in five domains: Material Management; Helicopter Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) and upgrades; Technical Support; Training & Flight Operations and Connected Services. With this contract, Heligo’s entire fleet of Airbus helicopters will benefit from the HCare Initial By-the-Hour programme.

Air travel demand is back

In the past few years, a decline in air travel has shaken the aviation industry. However, massive growth has occurred since 2023, given increased airline sales and traveling. According to the International Air Transport Association, global flight capacity is expected to return to normal in 2024, with about 40 million flights (an increase from 38.9 million in 2019) that are projected to carry a record 4.7 billion people (an increase from 4.5 billion people in 2019). The overwhelming demand from passengers plus a general shortage of planes has led to an increase in plane ticket prices. Airlines are spending billions of dollars on new planes to expand their supply and keep ticket prices reasonable.

Airbus thrives with increased travel demand

Airbus maintained its position as the leading plane manufacturer for the fifth consecutive year against its rival Boeing. Airbus reported record annual jet orders with 2,319 gross orders last year, more than twice the number in 2022 and 29.1% higher than its 1,796 record set in 2014. Though Airbus is thriving with the return of travelers, the company has its work cut out for it. A Reuters report said that Airbus delivered 735 of its planes last year, which leaves its order backlog at a total of 8,598. In addition, Airbus’ popular A320neo plane will be sold out until the early 2030s.

Boeing grows orders but struggles with setbacks

Boeing reported its highest order total since 2014 as well, with 1,456 gross orders in 2023 and 1,314 net orders after cancellation. But despite the increase in orders, Boeing is in trouble after a panel on its 737 MAX 9 recently blew out during an Alaska Airlines flight. Nobody was killed but it struck fear amongst the passengers and future fliers of Boeing. In 2019, Boeing also dealt with plane quality issues after having two plane crashes within a year; all passengers were killed. The crashes led to a global grounding and subsequent pause in production of the Boeing jet. Airbus ultimately overtook Boeing as the world’s biggest plane maker during the groundings and has maintained this position since then."
Get Ready For a New Delta Flagship: the Airbus A350-1000 is Coming - Skift Travel News,"Fri, 12 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjQvMDEvMTIvYS1uZXctZGVsdGEtZmxhZ3NoaXAtdGhlLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLTEwMDAtaXMtY29taW5nL9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjQvMDEvMTIvYS1uZXctZGVsdGEtZmxhZ3NoaXAtdGhlLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLTEwMDAtaXMtY29taW5nL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Delta is promising “world-class amenities” and more premium seating onboard a jet that it hopes will reaffirm its position as a leading legacy carrier.

Delta frequent flyers take note – there’s a brand-new flagship coming your way. The Atlanta-based carrier has confirmed that the Airbus A350-1000 is joining its long-haul flying roster. While specific details are still to be announced, expect this new jet to instantly become Delta’s biggest and best aircraft.

The airline already operates the smaller A350-900, and was the U.S. launch customer for the type. This latest order for its bigger brother suggests the carrier is pleased with what it has seen.

Ed Bastian, the Delta CEO said the A350-1000 will be the “most capable aircraft” in the fleet and hinted that it would enable further international expansion for the carrier. While no specific details were immediately available about the layout and cabins aboard the new jet, Bastian teased that it will offer “an elevated customer experience” with more premium seating and “best-in-class amenities.”

Travelers can expect around 15% more premium seats on the new plane compared to the aircraft it is replacing. For more upscale options, Delta One Suites, Delta Premium Select and Delta Comfort+ will all be available, in addition to the Main Cabin.

Delta Eyes All-Airbus Widebody Fleet

The Delta deal is for 20 A350-1000s, plus future options for an additional 20 planes. As the largest commercial jet offered by Airbus, this latest order definitely tilts the balance in favor of the European firm. Delta now has confirmed orders for 36 A350s and expects to have more than 60 of the type in its fleet by the end of the decade.

Looking more broadly, Delta currently operates more than 450 planes from Airbus, covering everything from short-haul jets right up to large transcontinental widebodies. While Delta remains a strong Boeing customer for single-aisle planes, including a major order for the 737 Max in 2022, the outlook for bigger jets is rather different.

For its longer flights, Delta flies a mix of Boeing 757 and 767s, along with Airbus A330s and A350-900s. With most of these Boeing jets reaching retirement age, the prospect of an all-Airbus long-haul fleet in the near future is certainly possible, and made all the more likely with today’s news. Even before this latest order, Delta had almost 200 additional Airbus planes on order.

Who Else Flies the A350-1000?

While this aircraft is going to be an exciting new addition for Delta, the model has been in service with other global carriers for several years. Qatar Airways was the first to fly the A350-1000 in 2018, with other big names such as British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Etihad Airways and Delta’s SkyTeam partner Virgin Atlantic all joining the -1000 club in the years since.

Latest Airbus data shows that the plane, including the smaller -900 variant, has more than 1,206 orders from 58 operators. The Delta news comes just days after EVA Air of Taiwan placed a major order for the A350 and A321neo.

Delta Air Lines is due to publish its fourth quarter and full-year 2023 earnings later on Friday. Skift and Airline Weekly teams will be covering the call and have full coverage."

Airbus Helicopters: Why does the H125 make sense for SANPARKS?

David Simelane: Our responsibility is to make sure that we provide the aerial support that is required over these 2 million hectares. We are also expanding our footprint outside the borders of the Kruger National Park, and servicing the rest of SANParks’ 19 parks. We use the H125, for its agility, luggage space, the power that the helicopters have, and its versatility. We can convert from a utility-type machine to a VIP machine fairly quickly. The general ease of piloting is also an attractive feature.

Airbus Helicopters: Does the helicopter play a role in protecting the park's animals?

David Simelane: Over the past decade we have been busy from an anti-poaching perspective, where we have been pummeled left, right and centre. We have been standing our ground and are happy to say there has been a reduction in poaching over the past couple of months. We complete about 500 hours of flying between the months of August and September completing census, where we go through the Kruger National Park with a fine-tooth comb, making sure that we have the right population of rhinos and elephants.

We are often flying low level, in the vicinity of a lot of birds and nature. When we're on anti-poaching missions, we're flying alongside various other aircraft. We have previously found an orphaned rhino, by the virtue of the fact of the mother having been poached. We have to sedate the rhino. Depending on the size, either lift it by cargo hook, or we have to put it in the back of the helicopter.

Airbus Helicopters: Do you often use the helicopter for medical and veterinary missions?

David Simelane: The Airbus H125 is the best platform for us here at SANPARKS. We are a service provider to the different SANParks departments ranging from scientific services to ranger services, conservation services to veterinary wildlife services. If we're going to be darting rhinos whilst doing de-horning, we've resorted to having to de-horn all of the rhinos that we have in the Kruger National Park. We have to fly with the doors slid to the back, and have a vet with us to be able to put the vet in position to dart.

We have rangers that patrol on a regular basis, and sometimes there are incursions with wild animals. I've personally experienced a ranger who had been trampled by a buffalo. We urgently had to rush a doctor to the scene. Luckily the ranger survived the contact with the buffalo and is back at work, thanks to the helicopter and quick response of the doctor and aircrew.

Airbus Helicopters: How does the H125’s performance support the operations?

David Simelane: The environment we are flying in is an unforgiving environment, so we prefer to have a uniform fleet, ensuring all pilots are familiar with the same helicopter, providing consistency. Ease of flight with the FLI, enables us to concentrate on the necessary external factors which are many in this environment.

H125 helicopters are very useful in this environment. From a density altitude (DA) perspective, we often exceed a DA where many other helicopters would struggle, we don’t have that many issues when we have a full complement of passengers and full fuel in 40 degrees Celsius, which we often have in the Kruger National Park in summer.

In terms of census, we are able to fly with the doors open, which provides us with a full view and that is really important for this activity. The ability to load as heavy as 1400 kilograms is by far one of the biggest advantages with this particular helicopter in our fleet."

"Christian Scherer, CCO of Airbus: ‘More than making a profit from Boeing’s troubles, we have to draw lessons’ - EL PAÍS USA","Sat, 20 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL2VuZ2xpc2guZWxwYWlzLmNvbS9lY29ub215LWFuZC1idXNpbmVzcy8yMDI0LTAxLTIwL2NocmlzdGlhbi1zY2hlcmVyLWNjby1vZi1haXJidXMtbW9yZS10aGFuLW1ha2luZy1hLXByb2ZpdC1mcm9tLWJvZWluZ3MtdHJvdWJsZXMtd2UtaGF2ZS10by1kcmF3LWxlc3NvbnMuaHRtbNIBtgFodHRwczovL2VuZ2xpc2guZWxwYWlzLmNvbS9lY29ub215LWFuZC1idXNpbmVzcy8yMDI0LTAxLTIwL2NocmlzdGlhbi1zY2hlcmVyLWNjby1vZi1haXJidXMtbW9yZS10aGFuLW1ha2luZy1hLXByb2ZpdC1mcm9tLWJvZWluZ3MtdHJvdWJsZXMtd2UtaGF2ZS10by1kcmF3LWxlc3NvbnMuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After a lifetime at Airbus, German-born Christian Scherer, 61, has been the head of the commercial division of the largest aeronautical manufacturer in the world for the past couple of weeks.

He lands in office at a particularly sweet moment: 2023 was a record year for orders and deliveries. Meanwhile, the flagship model of Airbus’ main competitor for short and medium-haul flights, Boeing’s 737 MAX, is going through its umpteenth crisis.

While visiting the Airbus factory in Getafe, on the outskirts of Madrid, Scherer spoke with EL PAÍS. On the issues faced by Boeing, he emphasized: “I prohibit myself from talking about the advantages [that stem from] what’s happening [with their company].”

Question. The airline sector has recovered from the pandemic much faster than expected.

Answer. Yes, the recovery has been faster than we ourselves anticipated. There’s a human desire to travel: as soon as restrictions were lifted, international travel resumed again.

Q. Something similar happened after the Russian invasion of Ukraine: the markets severely punished Moscow’s energy sector, but the recovery has been equally rapid...

A. The conflict in Ukraine has had an impact, but the world has adapted and air traffic has recovered.

Q. You’re receiving an avalanche of orders for new planes.

A. We’re satisfied, because it speaks of the relevance of our products. It’s a phenomenon that has to do with two factors: the accelerated recovery after two years of the pandemic and the replacement of older aircraft with more efficient ones, which consume and emit less [carbon].

Q. Which factor has carried more weight?

A. The [post-pandemic] recovery, but there’s also a growing awareness among airlines regarding decarbonization. This means they’re accelerating the renewal of their fleets. Only 30% of commercial aircraft flying today are of the latest generation; the rest consume between 25% and 30% more [energy]. One of our recent successes, when compared to Boeing, is that our aircraft are more efficient and, therefore, more environmentally friendly.

Q. The problem is that, as you yourselves recognize, Airbus isn’t able to produce and deliver enough aircraft to meet demand.

A. More than a problem, it’s a frustration. In March of 2020, we had to reduce production practically by half. It was traumatic: the investment cycle was interrupted… it’s not easy to turn everything off and on again. There’s a lot of inertia. Some capabilities of our industrial ecosystem were lost in the process.

Q. Do you think you overreacted by reducing productive capacity by so much?

A. No. We had an intense internal debate and there were those who believed that it had to be reduced even more, because the drop [in demand] was enormous. If we’d produced more, we would’ve run the risk of being left with airplanes on our balance sheet.

Q. Returning to the present, the opportunity that lies ahead is enormous: the market is clearly going through a phase of prosperity.

A. Our main job now is to manage this upward curve right to the capacity limits of our supply chain. The hot spots are in engine manufacturing and cabin equipment, because many airlines aren’t only buying new aircraft, but are also improving their current fleet.

Q. Can you increase the manufacturing rate even further?

A. Today, I don’t believe so: if a single supplier fails, the entire system collapses. And our supply chain is very long and complex.

Scherer, at the Airbus factory in Getafe, Spain. Samuel Sánchez

Q. Your main competitor, Boeing, is struggling.

A. Many observers say: “Christian, you’re selling like crazy and taking advantage of the situation to invade the skies and toss Boeing aside.” This isn’t the case: we manage the business in a much more serious way. The risk of making decisions with those parameters would be too high.

Q. 2024 has started very badly for them, with a new serious problem on the 737 MAX. Can Airbus take advantage of this situation for its own benefit?

A. Not in the conventional sense. What happens to Boeing is a Boeing issue, but also a reminder that safety is the most important pillar for us. It’s something non-negotiable. I don’t think we’re going to take advantage in the sense of selling more airplanes, because we’ve already sold everything. More than making a profit from this incident, we have to draw lessons.

Q. But one thing is clear: for an airline considering purchasing a Boeing 737 MAX, the most reasonable alternative is the A320. And that’s good for you.

A. Not necessarily. Any doubt about the integrity or safety of an aircraft isn’t positive. I prohibit myself from talking about advantages derived from what’s happening.

Q. Do you perceive greater interest from the airlines that, until now, have opted for Boeing planes?

A. They know that, in the short-term, we cannot satisfy demand. Even if a Boeing customer wanted to switch to Airbus, they wouldn’t be able to do so until 2030. We’re not substitutes. In that segment [short and medium-haul flights] we have a market share of two-thirds. This is a very, very strong position. Nobody has any doubts that the A320 is a very good product.

Q. Not so long ago, U.S. airlines practically only bought Boeing.

A. It’s true that, in recent years, both our presence and our [market] share in the U.S. has grown. This business is guided by commercial and financial decisions: each company opts for the most efficient and effective alternative. It’s natural that Airbus’ position of strength around the world also transfers to what’s probably the most competitive market on the planet.

Q. Much of the future of the airline sector, however, passes through China and India.

A. We’ve made a great effort to position ourselves in the largest growing market, which is India. We’re in a good position there and also in China, where, 20 years ago, we had a relatively modest position. Nowadays, we’re quite present, [we even have] an assembly line in Tianjin.

Q. China is also a source of competition. For years, Beijing has been trying to establish a large aircraft manufacturer. They seem to have found it in the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC).

A. Indeed, we have a new competitor. It’s legitimate that a country like China wants to increase its sovereignty in a strategic sector such as aviation: the pie is growing and it’s logical that there are more actors seeking their share. That said, the size of the ecosystem surrounding Airbus or Boeing is such that many countries or companies prefer a small part of that success, rather than a large fraction of a smaller success. This is the case in India, where some [parties] want the political glamor of having an assembly line. But there’s a smarter option available than taking the risk of becoming a direct competitor of Airbus or Boeing.

Q. You’re not afraid, then, of new competition.

A. No. It’s positive, because it forces us to maintain a high level of excellence and technological advancement. COMAC, for example, hasn’t put anything new on the table: same engines, same avionics, same basic architecture…

Q. But at a lower price.

A. The question is whether the world is going to want to buy a cheaper plane from yesterday, when an Airbus comes with new technology and allows for a reduction in energy consumption by nearly 25%.

Q. The airline sector is one of the most difficult to decarbonize. How can this be done?

A. 70% of the world’s fleet is still from previous generations. Equipping themselves with the best [technology] available is what airlines are doing.

Q. But that won’t be enough.

A. No, it won’t be. Today, unlike three years ago, I believe that an important part [of decarbonization] will be done via sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs).

Q. Do you see this as a bridge to hydrogen-powered planes?

A. Yes, a big bridge. It’ll be more than half of the medium-term solution, because an aircraft is a 25-year-long investment and it will take more than two decades to replace those that are flying today, which can already operate with SAFs. And there’s something else that we can improve: we live in a digital world, but air traffic management still suffers from many inefficiencies. We still fly in zigzags, constantly going up and down... just like 70 years ago. Improving that would reduce fuel consumption by 10%.

Q. Three years ago, Airbus announced that the first commercial aircraft powered by hydrogen would be flying by 2035. Will you keep that promise?

A. Yes, absolutely.

According to Airbus Helicopters CEO Bruno Even, the move will help the company respond to growing customer demands for autonomous systems and manned-unmanned teaming capabilities.

He further stated that Aerovel’s expertise in developing autonomous flight technology will “undoubtedly complement our UAS development with the VSR700, as well as the work that we have been doing to develop interoperability.”

Airbus said the acquisition has been approved by relevant bodies of both firms. However, it remains subject to regulatory approval.

The move is expected to be finalized later this year.

Flexrotor Drone

With the acquisition, Airbus is also expected to take ownership of Aerovel’s modern UAS called the Flexrotor.

It is described as a mission-proven force multiplier for operations in harsh, high-threat, and GPS-denied environments.

It is capable of performing vertical takeoff and landing, eliminating the need for long runways.

The unmanned system also has a maximum launch weight of 15 kilograms (33 pounds) and can stay airborne for up to 12 hours.

The Flexrotor is suitable for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance missions at sea and over land.

Maintaining Support for US Military

Aerovel CEO Ali Dian said joining forces with Airbus will allow for scaled up innovation, which could lead to continuous, unwavering support for the US military and its allies.

“We are proud to become part of an organization with a rich legacy of aerospace excellence and we look forward to leveraging our combined strengths to define the future of autonomous systems,” he said."

Offering to manage the entire lifecycle of an aircraft, the center can provide storage, maintenance, upgrades, conversions, dismantling, and recycling services in Chengdu. As Airbus subsidiary Satair will distribute used parts, the range of solutions is the first of its kind as a one-stop-shop, Airbus said.

The project is the company’s answer to an identified need for storage and end-of-life services in China.

Both the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and the Civil Aviation Administration of China have certified the Airbus Lifecycle Services Center (ALSC). Separately, the main buildings have obtained the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification for their construction.

The ALSC covers a surface area of 717,000 m² (177 acres) for a storage capacity of 125 aircraft. The site will ramp up operations between now and 2025, directly employing up to 150 employees. Longer-term plans call for 300 employees by 2030.

Some 75% of the aircraft stored at the ALSC are expected to fly again after storage and upgrade. The remaining aircraft will be dismantled with Tarmac Aerosave’s process, which recovers around 90% of the aircraft weight. “Our service center is a great example of Chinese-European cooperation in the development of the circular economy for the aviation industry,” Cristina Aguilar, Airbus SVP for customer services, said.

The project was launched five years ago. The joint venture combines Airbus’ brand, Chengdu’s mature aerospace industry, and Tarmac Aerosave’s maintenance and recycling capabilities. The opening took place almost on time under the 2022 plan, when it was expected late in 2023."
"Airbus, More European Aviation Firms Explore Hydrogen Future - FLYING","Wed, 31 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZseWluZ21hZy5jb20vYWlyYnVzLW1vcmUtZXVyb3BlYW4tYXZpYXRpb24tZmlybXMtZXhwbG9yZS1oeWRyb2dlbi1mdXR1cmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The goal of net-zero carbon emissions in aviation by 2050 has been widely adopted by airlines, countries (including the U.S.), and global collectives such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and International Air Transport Association (IATA). But the industry won’t get there without action.

This week, European firms announced two collaborations intended to herald the transition from traditional jet fuel to alternative sources, such as hydrogen.

The first, between industry titan Airbus and four Scandinavian firms, aims to study the feasibility of hydrogen infrastructure at airports in Norway and Sweden. The companies claim the study—which covers two countries and more than 50 airports—is the first of its kind.

“Hydrogen stands out as a key enabler as we pioneer a sustainable aviation future,” said Guillaume Faury, CEO of Airbus. “Norway and Sweden are among the most demanding regions for aviation and have great potential for hydrogen production from renewable energy sources.”

Faury added that the company intends to deploy hydrogen ecosystems in “most suitable parts of the world.”

Separately, Cranfield Aerospace Solutions (CAeS), a U.K.-based hydrogen aircraft developer, signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with LoganAir, the U.K.’s largest regional airline, to fly hydrogen-electric aircraft between Scotland’s Orkney Islands by 2027. The partners believe the collaboration could deliver the world’s first commercial zero-emissions flights.

Airbus Forms a Hydrogen Herd

Airbus on Wednesday said it will work with Avinor and Swedavia, the flag carriers of Norway and Sweden, respectively, as well as Scandinavian Airlines (SAS), which serves the broader region. The companies will be joined by Vattenfall, a Swedish energy and power firm, which will support the partnership with electrical infrastructure and hydrogen production.

“We want to enable industry decarbonization,” said Anna Borg, president and CEO of Vattenfall. “Aviation is a hard-to-abate industry, where breaking away from fossil fuels is a huge challenge today. This cross-border collaboration however demonstrates the willingness to bring about change.”

According to Airport Carbon Accreditation, airport-controlled activities comprise around 2 to 3 percent of all aviation emissions. To reduce that figure, airports will need to move away from traditional aviation fuel and toward sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other renewable alternatives, such as hydrogen.

“If generated from renewable energy through electrolysis, hydrogen emits no CO2 [carbon dioxide] emissions, thereby enabling renewable energy to potentially power large aircraft over long distances but without the undesirable by-product of CO2 emissions,” Airbus claims on its website.

Airbus and its partners will study hydrogen aircraft concepts and operations, infrastructure, and refueling at airports to develop a hydrogen ecosystem in Norway and Sweden. The study will also identify which airports are candidates for early transformations and which regulatory frameworks will need to be in place.

“Hydrogen is expected to gradually become an increasing part of the aviation industry’s fuel mix in the future and will therefore have an increasing effect on the infrastructure and planning of our airports,” said Jonas Abrahamsson, president and CEO of Swedavia. “This partnership is a major and important step towards fossil-free aviation in the Nordic region.”

Airbus sees potential for hydrogen to be combusted into fuel to power modified gas turbines or converted to electric power via fuel cells. It could even be used to create synthetic fuels, or e-fuels, which are generated exclusively using renewable sources.

The manufacturer’s goal is to bring a low-carbon commercial aircraft to market by 2035. In 2020, it launched ZEROe: a program to develop aircraft, systems, and an ecosystem for hydrogen aviation. All four aircraft concepts being developed under ZEROe—a turbofan, turboprop, blended-wing body, and fully electric model—are hydrogen powered and designed for 100 to 200 passengers.

Last week, Airbus tested ZEROe’s “iron pod” hydrogen power system, a key milestone in the program’s progress. And in December, the EcoPulse demonstrator, a joint project between Airbus, Daher, and Safran, made its first hybrid-electric flight.

To build out an ecosystem, Airbus in 2020 introduced “Hydrogen Hub at Airports,” a program that initiated research into infrastructure requirements for low-carbon airport operations. The initiative brings together key industry players and includes airports, airlines, and other partners in France, Germany, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, and the U.K.

Electrifying the Islander

As Airbus and Co. collaborate on hydrogen infrastructure, CAeS and LoganAir are eyeing real-world flights.

LoganAir, which aims to be net-zero by 2040, hopes to fly the first operational hydrogen-electric Islander in the Orkney Islands by 2027, following certification in 2026. The Islander is one of the best-selling commercial airliners in Europe, used primarily for short-range commercial passenger service.

“The short-haul routes we operate in Orkney and the challenging weather conditions we face make the ideal test bed for hydrogen-electric aircraft, and we are incredibly proud that we could be offering the world’s first commercial zero-emissions flights,” said Peter Simpson, executive chairman of Loganair.

LoganAir is a longtime supporter of CAeS’ Project Fresson: an initiative, partially funded by the U.K. government, to develop hydrogen fuel cell propulsion systems for the more than 700 Islanders in operation, supported by Britten-Norman.

This week’s MOU, however, steps up the firms’ collaboration with additional operational requirements and design, standards and regulations, infrastructure development, and stakeholder engagement.

A proposed merger between CAeS and Britten-Norman, announced last year, would form a new company dedicated almost entirely to installing CAeS fuel cells on Islanders. But the firms have since put a pause on the deal.

“Collaborating closely with Loganair, we aim to harness our combined experience and expertise to address the operational and infrastructure considerations, ultimately ensuring the successful deployment of the hydrogen-electric Britten-Norman Islander across Loganair’s lifeline routes within the islands,” said Paul Hutton, CEO of Cranfield Aerospace.

Separately, CAeS is continuing to develop hydrogen fuel cells for a range of crewed and uncrewed aircraft, including cargo aircraft. In October, its fuel cell system order pipeline topped 1,300 with a letter of intent from cargo drone operator Dronamics.

Now United also faces delays in getting new planes, after the incident raised doubts over regulatory approval for a new model of the MAX, for which it has placed big orders.

The chaos has the airline considering its options.

Reuters sources say Chief Executive Scott Kirby flew to France for talks with Airbus.

He’s said to be sounding out the possibility of an order for its A321neo jets.

Trouble is, they’re in hot demand, and all but sold out for years to come.

However, Bloomberg News says Airbus is trying to buy back delivery slots from other airlines in a bid to construct a viable offer.

United has 277 Boeing Max 10 jets on order.

That’s a larger variant than the one in the blowout drama, but could still be affected by the troubles at Boeing.

Kirby said last week that United hadn’t cancelled the order, but he added that the U.S. planemaker wouldn’t be able to meet the contracted delivery dates on many of the aircraft.

Signs of a possible Airbus deal have reportedly raised concern at Boeing, which shares historical roots with United.

But Monday later brought hope of a silver lining.

Irish budget airline Ryanair - one of Boeing's biggest customers - said it would take over any MAX 10 orders dropped by U.S. carriers."
Airbus Helicopters to buy UAS firm Aerovel - Helicopter Investor,"Mon, 15 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlbGljb3B0ZXJpbnZlc3Rvci5jb20vbmV3cy8xMDA5NTkvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLWJ1eXMtdW5tYW5uZWQtYWVyaWFsLXN5c3RlbS1maXJtLWFlcm92ZWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters to buy UAS firm Aerovel

news by Mike Stones 15 January 2024 Print this page

Airbus Helicopters is to acquire unmanned aerial system (UAS) firm Aerovel, in a bid to strengthen its portfolio of tactical unmanned solutions, including Flexrotor. This is a small tactical UAS designed to deliver intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance (ISTAR) missions, including parapublic flights, over land and sea.

Flexrotor has a maximum launch weight of 25 kg, has been designed for ISTAR missions of between 12-14 hours. It can integrate different types of payloads including an electro-optical system and advanced sensors to suit bespoke mission needs. The rotorcraft can launch and recover autonomously from either land or sea requiring only a 12ft by 12ft platorm.

Bruno Even, CEO, Airbus Helicopters said the acquisition fitted the company’s goal of expanding its UAS offering and responding to rising demand for additional mission capabilities, such as manned-unmanned teaming. “Aerovel’s expertise in autonomous flight technology will undoubtedly complement our UAS development with the VSR700, as well as the work that we have been doing to develop interoperability,” he said.

Ali Dian, CEO of Aerovel said the acquisition would enable Aerovol to scale innovation and accelerate the development of unmanned aviation. “We are proud to become part of an organisation with a rich legacy of aerospace excellence and we look forward to leveraging our combined strengths to define the future of autonomous systems,” said Dian.

In addition to defence applications the Flexrotor can be deployed on parapublic missions, such as forest fire surveillance providing firefighters with critical images day or night, and ice navigation in helping guide naval vessels through ice in the Arctic ocean. “The Flexrotor is a mission-proven, force multiplier for operations in harsh, high-threat, GPS-denied environments,” he added.

Based in Bingen, Washington, Aerovel, will remain a US-owned company and continue collaboration with the US Department of Defense under Airbus’ Special Security Agreement (SSA). The acquisition has been approved by the relevant bodies of both companies but remains subject to regulatory approvals. The transaction is expected to close this year."

Airbus Deliveries

It was a momentous year for Airbus, receiving a 12% increase from 2022 in the number of deliveries taking place. The data below demonstrates the A320 family’s rise in popularity, with A320 family deliveries making up 78% of Airbus’s total number of delivered aircraft.

Airbus’ wide reach, with 87 customers, demonstrated its ability to cater to diverse markets. CEO Guillaume Faury described this achievement as “a landmark year for Airbus’ commercial aircraft business.”

The Toulouse-based manufacturer didn’t only make progress in terms of deliveries but also with orders. Airbus received 2,319 new orders last year, bringing its total order backlog to 8,598 aircraft.

Boeing Deliveries

While 2024 may have seen a rough start to the year for Boeing, 2023 was not short of eventful for the American manufacturer. On January 31, American cargo and charter airline Atlas Air (5Y) took delivery of the final Boeing 747, bringing an end to the Queen of the Skies’ production.

In 2023, Boeing delivered a total of 528 aircraft, representing a 10% increase from the previous year. The 737 family remains the Seattle-based manufacturer’s most popular aircraft type, making up three-quarters of total deliveries.

Despite a lack of deliveries for both types, the year saw a highly anticipated return of both the Airbus A380 and Boeing 747 to the skies. The travel boom represents the industry’s ability to recover from highly challenging circumstances, something that both Boeing and Airbus worked hard to prove.

January 11, 2024, © Leeham News: Airbus exceeded its target for aircraft deliveries last year and achieved a record number of orders despite what it called a “complex” and “volatile” operating environment, according to the company’s newly released 2023 order and delivery data.

The European planemaker delivered 735 commercial aircraft to 87 customers in 2023, versus 661 commercial aircraft to 84 customers the previous year – an increase of 11%, Figure 1.

That was above the Airbus target of 720 commercial aircraft deliveries over the 12 months.

Of the 735 deliveries, 68 were from the A220 family, 571 were from the A320 family, 32 were from the A330 family and 64 were A350 family aircraft. Compared with the previous year, A330 and A350 family deliveries were broadly flat, while A220 and A320 family deliveries were significantly higher.

A321 deliveries accounted for 56% of A320 family deliveries. Airbus confirmed the latest variant in that family, the A321XLR, has reached the latter part of flight testing with the first delivery expected in Q2 2024.

The commercial aircraft business registered 2,319 gross new orders (2,094 net after cancellations), putting its 2023 year-end backlog at 8,598 aircraft. This was the first time Airbus has topped 2,000 net orders in a year.

The figure was a sharp increase versus 2022, when there were 1,078 gross commercial orders (820 net), and 7,239 aircraft in the backlog.

For comparison, Boeing data shows it delivered 528 aircraft in 2023 and received 1,456 gross new orders (1,314 net).

Production ramp up

Guillaume Faury, Airbus CEO, said 2023 had been a “landmark year”, citing “increased flexibility and capability of our global industrial system, as well as the strong demand from airlines to refresh their fleets”.

Airbus continues to target a ramp-up of production by 2026, with the A220 program expected to reach 14 aircraft per month, the A320 program targeting 75 aircraft per month, and the A350 aiming for 10 aircraft per month. Faury said these plans were still “on track”.

Christian Scherer, Airbus’ newly appointed CEO for commercial aircraft, said widebody orders returned in 2023, “much sooner than expected”. “We have never sold as many A320s or A350s in any given year,” he said.

During a virtual question and answer session hosted by Airbus in Toulouse, Scherer told LNA that issues affecting the Pratt & Whitney GTF engine, which powers nearly half of the global fleet of A320neos and all A220s, may have dented output.

“The delivery number in 2023 could have been higher had we not had the GTF bottleneck,” he said. “When it comes to 2024, I do not see any reason that the GTF issues which are facing a very different challenge today … would affect 2024. We have an agreement with P&W on the volumes that are needed and I don’t see any impact versus what we have agreed.”

Response to MAX issues

Faury was also asked about quality assurance issues affecting the Boeing 737-9 MAX after the Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 decompression. Spirit AeroSystems, the maker of the 737 fuselages and the plug door, is also an Airbus supplier (for the A220, A320 and A350 programs).

Faury said, “We know there is a difficult situation in the supply chain. We are really taking a lot of care and supporting the supply chain. We have been working very closely with Spirit [AeroSystems]. The incident … is a rather fresh one and we are monitoring everything closely. We will be taking each and every learning and we would expect Spirit to do exactly the same.”

The Airbus CEO was asked about the Japan Air Lines Airbus A350 ground collision in Tokyo at the beginning of January. Faury commented that while it was too early to speculate on the outcome of the investigation, data from the incident would provide an “important source of learning”.

Scherer also noted Airbus’ continued commitment to introduce a hydrogen-powered aircraft at some point in the 2030s, alongside a replacement for the A320neo family which has a similar timeframe.

Airbus shares soar to record high as Boeing faces hard landing ahead - Euronews,"Wed, 10 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9uZXdzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDI0LzAxLzEwL2FpcmJ1cy1zaGFyZXMtc29hci10by1yZWNvcmQtaGlnaC1hcy1ib2VpbmctZmFjZXMtaGFyZC1sYW5kaW5nLWFoZWFk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Piero Cingari

The timeless Latin maxim ""mors tua vita mea"" –your death is my life – resonates deeply in the ongoing battle for supremacy within the aircraft manufacturing duopoly.

The timeless Latin maxim ""mors tua vita mea"" – your death is my life – resonates deeply in the ongoing battle for supremacy within the aircraft manufacturing duopoly.

On Tuesday, 9 January 2023, the French aircraft manufacturer Airbus SE achieved an extraordinary milestone as its shares reached an all-time high of €145. This remarkable accomplishment followed Boeing's dramatic 8% decline just a day earlier, marking the American company's most significant one-day drop since October 2022.

While Airbus sets its sights on unprecedented heights in the stock market, its American counterpart Boeing grapples with severe safety concerns looming over its reputation.

Boeing's Turbulence: Safety concerns and groundings

Boeing is battling significant challenges with the Federal Aviation Administration's grounding of 171 of its 737-MAX 9 planes following a troubling incident involving an Alaska Airlines flight. Shortly after takeoff, the flight witnessed the unexpected ejection of a mid-cabin door plug. Fortunately, the plane completed an emergency landing without any reported injuries.

The FAA's decision was swiftly echoed by European regulators, amplifying the impact on Boeing. The grounding is reminiscent of a similar crisis four years ago when the 737 MAX was benched worldwide after two fatal crashes, later attributed to flaws in flight-control software.

Bank of America issued a cautionary note this week, expressing serious concerns about an aircraft delivered as recently as 31 October, 2023, and stressing that Boeing must navigate this reputational hazard zone with utmost caution. The bank's analysts have warned that continued troubles could undermine public trust in the 737 MAX and potentially hurt sales.

""The incident is alarming, and grounding a fleet of this aircraft type raises questions about what corrective actions will be required and how long they will take to perform,"" noted Goldman Sachs in a separate statement. ""Any quality control issues introduce risk to the production and delivery schedule,"" analysts added.

Ryanair's Chief Executive Officer, Michael O'Leary, mentioned that Boeing ""needs to significantly improve quality control"" as they strive to catch up on production delays.

""The 737 is fine, but it doesn't need these kinds of short-term reputational issues,"" O'Leary said in an interview with the Financial Times. He also expressed concern that traffic and profits at his airline would be impacted due to the incident. Ryanair, a major Boeing client and Europe's leading airline by passenger numbers, relies exclusively on Boeing 737s for its mainline fleet.

Airbus' ascent: Sealing deals and expanding horizons

Reports from industry insiders, as cited by Reuters on Monday, indicate that Airbus is on the brink of finalising a significant contract with Delta Air Lines, one of the US's major carriers. The proposed agreement could potentially include dozens of jets, including extra A350-1000 aircraft, and is poised to play a pivotal role in Airbus's strategic expansion efforts, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. An eagerly anticipated official announcement could arrive as early as this Friday.

In another triumph for Airbus, the company recently secured a substantial order from Taiwan's EVA Air. The order includes 18 long-range A350-1000s and 15 single-aisle A321neo jets, as announced in a press release on Tuesday.

At present, Boeing maintains a higher market valuation at €126 billion compared to Airbus's €113 billion. Over the past year, Boeing has generated €71.6 billion in revenue, surpassing Airbus's €63.2 billion in revenue.

Nonetheless, the tides may soon turn in Airbus's favour, as Boeing's reputation may suffer a significant blow due to recent events. This could potentially result in Airbus surpassing its American counterpart in the coming weeks.

All eyes are now on 31 January, 2024, when Boeing is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter 2023 results. The management is likely to provide further insights into the economic challenges and potential setbacks that Boeing may face following the incident. Airbus, is set to report its results on 15 February, 2024."

RACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, it's been a difficult start to 2024 for Boeing. After ending 2023 warning its customers about possible loose bolts on its aircraft, one of its 737 Max 9 jets had its door plug blow out at 16,000 feet during that Alaska Airlines flight on Friday night. So could this be an opportunity for Boeing's competitor Airbus? Our very own Brad Smith is here to break all of this down. Hey, Brad.

BRAD SMITH: Hey. Good morning, Rachelle. Yeah, you set it up perfectly there. And as we're continuing to keep a close eye on Boeing shares, investors have a few things to consider right now.

Number one, what will this do in terms of some of the airlines who have orders in with Boeing for the 737 Max 9 that are either en route for delivery and need to be inspected further or they already have them in their fleet and need to be inspected and are grounded for the time being?

And then how does this impact the overall shift in share perhaps between Airbus and Boeing being that they are essentially the lion's share-- the two major lion's share holders of that large plane order and manufacturing process? So ultimately here at the end of the day, we were taking a look at Boeing shares. They are lower right now and over the past five days losing about 10%.

One of the things that jumped up during our discussion with Steve Trent of Citi who looks across this entire industry and his analysis that came forward this morning, he said he thinks it's hard to say whether or not this is going to affect some of the airlines that have purchase orders in where they've got a guaranteed amount that they will purchase but then they will also have an amount that is an option on the other side of the agreement that they can choose to exercise or not.

Story continues

The issue that they need to consider that he so aptly notes, it doesn't seem like as of right now, you're going to see a concerted move because there have been so many delays in equipment over the last couple of years. And it doesn't seem like that's going to ease any time soon.

But certainly, if we have one or more-- one or two airlines somewhere that don't want to accelerate their deliveries, it could create room in the sky for someone else to accelerate, namely Airbus here. So you're taking a look at United Airlines and Alaska. Those have been two of the impacted airline operators.

And notably going forward from this point, I think investors are gonna be paying close attention to what the company says in the wake of this, leading up to the January 31st earnings call because that's where we're going to get even more detail around how this may have impacted or how this impacts even the forecasts for the company going forward. Rachelle.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: Indeed we'll be tracking that disruption, of course. The extra cost that you have to factor in for training, updating the manuals, and things like that. So we'll be looking for that on the earnings call. Thank you as always, our very own Brad Smith.

BRAD SMITH: Thanks."

The possible sale of its Big Data and Security (BDS) business was announced by Atos in a market update outlining its strategy for repaying and refinancing financial debts.

The potential deal is at a preliminary stage, but Atos said it will initiate a due diligence phase after receiving an offer valuing BDS between €1.5 billion ($1.64 billion) and €1.8 billion ($1.97 billion).

Atos shares fell after the company made the announcement.

The first rumors of Airbus being interested in Atos’ cybersecurity business emerged in March 2022. Nearly one year later, Airbus made a bid for a 30% stake in the Atos’ Evidian security business, which would later become Eviden. Some shareholders expressed opposition and the plan was dropped.

The Eviden brand now includes BDS as well as Atos’ cloud computing business.

In a statement, Airbus said, “The acquisition of BDS could significantly accelerate the digital transformation of Airbus, enhance the company’s defence and security portfolio with strong capabilities in cyber, advanced computing and artificial intelligence.”

First Look Onboard Air India’s A350 Flagship: Is It Worth the Wait? - Skift Travel News,"Fri, 19 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjQvMDEvMTkvZmlyc3QtbG9vay1hdC1haXItaW5kaWFzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLWZsYWdzaGlwLWlzLWl0LXdvcnRoLXRoZS13YWl0L9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjQvMDEvMTkvZmlyc3QtbG9vay1hdC1haXItaW5kaWFzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLWZsYWdzaGlwLWlzLWl0LXdvcnRoLXRoZS13YWl0L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With the airline focusing so many of its turnaround initiatives on the A350, the jet marks a huge opportunity to showcase the new Air India to the world.

Air India is starting the new year with a bold statement of intent. On Thursday, the carrier showcased its new flagship aircraft, as part of a bigger plan to present a re-energized Air India to the world.

On display at the Wings India aviation show, was the airline’s first Airbus A350-900. This marks one of 20 such aircraft on order (along with another 20 of the larger A350-1000). The company received the jet on December 23 and has been busy since then getting it certified and ready for entry into service.

For many insiders and industry watchers alike, the A350 is being considered the cornerstone of the new fleet and a representative of a ‘New Air India’. The airline has snapped up six A350-900s, originally prepared to Aeroflot’s specifications. However, with international sanctions on Russia, these aircraft were ultimately offered to other carriers. Turkish Airlines was the other big-name brand that snapped up six of the rerouted airframes.

What’s Inside Air India’s A350?

Thursday’s airshow in the southern city of Hyderabad was the first time Air India had publicly presented its new flagship, and Skift was among the first to take a look.

Despite the jet being initially bound for the Moscow-based operator, Air India has taken its time to reupholster the aircraft to make it ‘their’ product. There’s little evidence of any Aeroflot colors in sight. The A350-900 seats 316 passengers in a three-class configuration: 28 in business, 24 in premium economy, and 264 in economy.

On board, the product and experience are designed to reflect a premium carrier, a positioning not typically associated with Air India in recent years.

The Collins Aerospace Horizon Premier seat (originally destined for Aeroflot) kits out the business class cabin. Variations of these can be found on some Turkish Airlines and Air Canada widebody aircraft.

The seat, or suite, is equipped with sliding doors to keep up with the current trend of enhanced privacy. Inside is a 79-inch fully flat bed, a personal wardrobe, and direct aisle access for all passengers. The seats have ample stowage for personal items, five recline modes, and a big 21-inch screen.

A nuance not noticed otherwise, but these A350s are also fitted with inflight humidifiers for the business class cabin. These should bring the humidity from 5-7 percent in the front cabin to 20-22 percent. The impact is noticeable not just on the passengers’ wellbeing but also on the flavor of the food and beverages served at 35,000 feet.

Rather excitingly, directly behind the business class cabin is a social area, which can be transformed into a bar. Skift understands that Air India plans to use the space to serve drinks and snacks to premium cabin passengers.

Air India A350 Premium Economy

Premium economy uses the Collins Aerospace MIQ seat, a popular choice across the aviation world. This is laid out in a 2-4-2 configuration, making the window seats perfect for couples. With a 38-inch pitch and 18.5-inch width, the seat is a full one-inch wider than the plane’s economy options. Entertainment-wise, there’s a 13.3-inch screen and a calf rest for kicking back to watch a movie.

Economy passengers can expect a 31-inch seat pitch and a very respectable 12-inch HD screen. When sampled by Skift, the seat padding also felt good enough to keep travelers comfortable for a long-haul flight.

Air India is offering the Panasonic eX3 in-flight entertainment system, which boasts more than 2,200 hours of content. In-flight WiFi will also be offered, although payment plans are currently to be confirmed. To keep electronics charged, seats are equipped with USB-A sockets, while the premium cabins offer universal A/C plugs.

Air India is due to introduce its first six A350-900s on international routes in mid-2024. Where does the airline intend to fly these? It wouldn’t say, but expect these to be a familiar sight in and around Europe, given they are purpose-built for longer missions.

New Amenity Kits for Air India

To coincide with the international A350 launch later this year, there will also be an upgrade to the amenity items and tableware across the fleet.

First and business class passengers (the A350-900 doesn’t offer first class), can look forward to exclusive Ferragamo amenity kits. Currently, the airline offers TUMI products for travelers in its top-tier cabins. Despite the relaunch, TUMI has been retained to supply premium economy items. Economy customers will also receive amenity kits, albeit only on ultra-long-haul flights, such as those between India and the United States. In the interest of sustainability, these will be produced using kraft paper. The airline has also refreshed the sleepwear designed by TUMI.

Air India is also focusing on the linens used in its high-end cabins. The airline will have bespoke duvets and mattress-toppers that can also be used as pillows. New blankets in the business class and first class cabins are made of a premium wool blend with a delicate jacquard border and motifs are inspired by the traditional Sozni embroidery of Jammu and Kashmir, a Union Territory of India. Air India claims to be the world’s only airline to offer wool-blended blankets in first and business class.

New tableware will also be introduced later this year. It is a smart mix between the new brand identity of the airline and a reflection of the premium airline it wants to transform into.

Premium passengers will dine with fine chinaware, complete with intricate Mandala patterns. Hot beverages will be served in a mug with the airline’s beloved mascot, the Maharaja. A uniquely Indian tiffin box-shaped, salt and pepper cruet set is sure to delight guests worldwide. Presented with a gorgeous gold finish, it seems to have been designed to be pinched, just like those provided by Virgin Atlantic.

As for the food itself, an Air India insider confirmed to Skift that a new menu for the premium cabins will follow the international launch, along with an expanded wine list.

While the A350 will be the first aircraft to see the new service elements, it will be subsequently rolled out on the other aircraft flying internationally.

When Does Air India’s A350 Launch?

The A350 will enter commercial service with Air India on January 22, 2024. As is customary in the airline world, the new jet will operate familiarization domestic flights for several weeks. This will be an opportunity for the crew to be trained on the unique features and service protocols on board and for the airline to make any last-minute tweaks.

Overall, this is a great product to start the new beginnings for Air India. With this new aircraft, the airline will have ample opportunity to fix its image as a tired and uncompetitive airline."

In November, Airbus' mammoth freighter, the Beluga ""Super Transporter,"" received its own air operator certificate and officially became a new independent airline.

The five-strong BelugaST fleet mostly transported airplane parts for Airbus' cargo subsidiary, Airbus Transport International, for more than 20 years but now they fly under a newly established subsidiary called Airbus Beluga Transport, or AiBT to serve contract customers looking to move large items.

Airbus unveils weighty ambitions for the Beluga as AiBT gains its AOC - theloadstar.com,"Wed, 17 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbG9hZHN0YXIuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy11bnZlaWxzLXdlaWdodHktYW1iaXRpb25zLWZvci10aGUtYmVsdWdhLWFzLWFpYnQtZ2FpbnMtaXRzLWFvYy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Charlotte Goldstone 17/01/2024

Airbus’s outsized air cargo service, Airbus Beluga Transport (AiBT), should see more commercial use after being awarded its own Air Operator Certificate (AOC).

The huge capacity offered by the Beluga could plug a gap in the market since the conflict between Ukraine and Russia saw Russian-owned AN-124s leaving the western market following sanctions.

While three Belugas are available to customers, Airbus said that, due to high demand, the limited slots were quickly booked.

It explained: “We are currently in a ramp-up phase and will be for the next couple of years, until we reach the ‘cruising’ phase.

“This means we are still hiring and training new staff, which will help us perform more flights every year while increasing our responsiveness to customers’ requests.”

Cargo sales director at Air Charter Service (ACS), James Cristofoli told The Loadstar: “We have yet to use the Beluga. They usually need a minimum of two months’ notice – often a lot more – to find availability and to work through their internal process to confirm a piece of cargo is loadable.”

Since the Beluga is unique to Airbus, there is no immediate source of ready-qualified pilots and consequently, pilots of other types commonly operated have to be brought in and trained to operate the Beluga, which “takes time”.

Over the past two years, delivered payloads for AiBT have been mainly for Airbus Helicopters and Airbus Defence and Space. But with its own AOC, Airbus can expand its customer base, “depending on the current worldwide market demand”, it said.

To help, AiBT has forged an agreement with Airbus on further investment to certify the Beluga to carry more types of helicopters, containers and aircraft engines.

Manager of charter sales at Maximus Air, which operates an AN-124, Yazen Hyassat told The Loadstar: “The Beluga can be a solution for only a handful of outsize cargo customers, because it requires a sophisticated loading and off-loading system that must always fly with the aircraft, and it can only operate to airports that have ground equipment able handle it.”

Initially, AiBT flights will operate on the existing Airbus network. These flights commenced in November for routes to Saint Nazaire, Hamburg, Bremen, Sevilla and others.

In terms of pricing, Airbus told The Loadstar every mission would be “customised according to the requirements of the customer and type of mission”. Factors include origin and destination and the complexity and characteristics of the payload, such as weight, dimensions and whether it contains dangerous goods.

Head of flight operations Olivier Schneider said: “Our goal is to have a fleet of five Belugas operating all around the world… The thought of Airbus’s mythical Belugas flying over the world’s continents fills me with eager expectation. The market is there, we will do our best to achieve this.”

Boeing has a similar outsize freighter, the Dreamlifter, but Mr Cristofoli said: “The Dreamlifter is not available for charter. It is dedicated 100% to Boeing.”"

Founded in 2016, Airbus OneWeb Satellites JV produced more than 600 satellites for the first-generation OneWeb satellite constellation, Airbus U.S. Space & Defense said Monday.

The completion of the transaction has made Airbus U.S. Space & Defense the sole owner of AOS and the satellite production plant in Merritt Island, Florida.

“This agreement furthers our position as a market leader in the small satellite constellation business, building on our successful partnership with OneWeb,” said Robert Geckle, chairman and CEO of Airbus U.S. Space & Defense.

“We will continue mass producing small satellites for our customers and are excited for what the future holds for us on Florida’s Space Coast as we move forward,” added Geckle, a previous Wash100 awardee.

The ZEROe Development Centre (ZEDC) at the Stade site, which is near Hamburg and employs around 2,000 people making composite aircraft parts is to prioritise the developing “cost-competitive” composite hydrogen systems, such as tanks.

The technology development will cover the product and industrial capabilities from elementary parts, assembly and the manufacturing-related testing of the liquid hydrogen (LH2) composite tanks.

Engineers at other Airbus ZEDC are also working on LH2 storage tanks, including at the Madrid ZEDC.

Airbus chief technical officer Sabine Klauke said, “Establishing a composite-related ZEDC in Germany strengthens our Research and Technology footprint in the country and ensures the involvement, from the start, of experts to support our decarbonization ambition.

“Furthermore, the ZEDC will benefit from the wider composite research and development ecosystem such as the Airbus subsidiary Composite Technology Center, the CFK NORD in Stade as well as from further synergies from space and maritime activities.”

Similarly to other ZEDCs opened previously in Bremen, Germany; Nantes, France; Madrid, Spain and Filton, UK. The Stade ZEDC is being supported by local government funding as part of programs to decarbonise the aerospace industry.

Airbus’ ZEROe program aims to get a hydrogen-powered aircraft in the sky by 2035."
Lufthansa Cargo Airbus A321 Freighter Repairs Set For Completion - Aviation Week,"Tue, 16 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcmNyYWZ0LXByb3B1bHNpb24vbHVmdGhhbnNhLWNhcmdvLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIxLWZyZWlnaHRlci1yZXBhaXJzLXNldC1jb21wbGV0aW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Lufthansa Cargo and conversion specialist Elbe Flugzeugwerke (EFW) said repairs to two of the operator’s Airbus A321 freighter aircraft which were found to have cracks in the rear floor structure should be completed within days.

The issues did not compromise the safe operation of the aircraft.

During a routine maintenance check Jan. 9, Lufthansa Cargo found that one of its Airbus A321 freighters, which had been converted by EFW, had a crack in the rear floor structure. The operator inspected its three other converted A321 freighters. On one aircraft, a minor crack was also found, while no issues were detected on the two others, which returned to service Jan. 10.

EFW gave an update on the repairs in a Jan. 15 statement, saying the cracks were the first two such A321P2F cases reported to EFW and that after analysis of the data, it has concluded that the damage does not lead to unsafe conditions for the operation of the aircraft.

Repairs are expected to be completed within days, a Lufthansa Cargo spokesperson said.

“Our aircraft are safe, there is currently no indication that the damage is related to the P2F modification,” EFW CEO Jordi Boto added. “The detailed loads analyses have meanwhile shown that the A321P2F certified mechanical loads are similar or even lower compared to the passenger aircraft results.”

EFW said the effect of the ballast on the floor grid had also been checked and not found to induce significant loads to the affected fuselage structure. The stress levels are comparable to the A321 passenger aircraft, EFW said, adding: “At this stage, there is no specific action required for operators.”

An Airbus spokesperson said: “We have been made aware of findings on rear fuselages of two Airbus A321F operated by Lufthansa CityLine for Lufthansa Cargo. Airbus Engineering has been involved by EFW immediately after the finding report and joint investigations have been initiated.”

The spokesperson added: “We are currently working closely with all parties involved to elaborate the matter. So far, it can be confirmed that such damages linked to corrosion do not affect the load carrying capability of the surrounding structure of the converted freighter aircraft. The safe operation of the aircraft is not compromised, following a thorough inspection scheme and standard repair guidance. At this stage no further specific action is required.”

EFW added that the issues were “nothing unusual” for mid-age A321 aircraft. EFW therefore instructed Lufthansa Cargo on the repairs needed as per the aircraft’s structural repair manual.

“The standard repairs for Lufthansa Cargo aircraft will be completed within a few days. After completion of further scheduled maintenance tasks, which are not related to the crack findings, the aircraft can return to operation,” EFW added.

A spokesperson for Lufthansa Cargo also noted that passenger A320 family aircraft were not affected by the issue.

“The repairs should be completed within a few days. All parties involved are working to return the aircraft to service as soon as possible,” the Lufthansa Cargo spokesperson said. “The D-AEUC is still in its scheduled layover period (from Dec. 26, 2023, until Jan. 21, 2024) and is therefore not scheduled for any missions. The repairs are expected to be completed within its scheduled layover period.”"
Airbus Helicopters reports 'record year' for H145 model - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 24 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLXJlcG9ydHMtcmVjb3JkLXllYXItZm9yLWgxNDUtbW9kZWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters reported a “solid sales performance” in 2023, logging 410 gross orders (393 net orders) of helicopters in the civil and parapublic markets.

“What we have seen in 2023 is a steady helicopter market still recovering from the low point that we had in 2020,” said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters, during a media briefing on Jan. 23.

While the company is still not performing at its same pre-pandemic levels, lagging about 20 percent below 2019’s performance, Even still calls 2023 a “solid and strong year” for Airbus.

The company delivered 346 helicopters to 179 customers in 47 countries, representing a preliminary 54 percent share of the market.

“Airbus Helicopters’ order intake in 2023, with an increase bordering 10 percent in units in comparison to 2022, highlights its stable growth despite the ongoing global context of inflation and geopolitical instability,” Even said.

The H145, in particular, has experienced a record year with 186 orders for the type in 2023. Its military variant attracted the attention of German Bundeswehr, which placed an order for up 82 of the light attack helicopter — the largest order for the H145M type. The H145 has logged more than seven million flight hours since the beginning of the program.

Sales of the H125 also performed well with 108 orders in 2023, followed by the H130 with 39 orders, and the H135 with 29 orders. Even said the H135 maintains a strong position in the emergency medical services (EMS), private and business aviation, and oil-and-gas markets.

The executive said there has also been “good momentum” for the company’s H160, which finally received Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification in 2023 — three years after the type’s approval in Europe. The company logged 26 orders for the H160 last year.

“More importantly, we can say that we have customers for all the market segments that we target for the H160,” Even said. This includes the energy segment, private and business aviation, search-and-rescue, law enforcement, military, and EMS.

In total, Airbus helicopters have logged more than three million flight hours in 2023. Even calls the company’s performance a “testament to the versatility of our products on both the civil and military market.”

In a company press release, Airbus highlighted other milestones over the last year, including the first flight of the NH90 Sea Tiger, an anti-submarine warfare helicopter for the German Navy, and delivery of the Spanish Navy’s first H135 helicopter.

“On the development side, the H175M successfully performed flight demonstrations in the extreme hot and high conditions of the desert in Saudi Arabia, while the VSR700 demonstrated its performance during sea trials from a French Navy multi-mission frigate,” Even stated.

On the sustainability side of the business, Airbus achieved the first flight of the DisruptiveLab demonstrator in 2023, designed to reduce fuel consumption through a new aerodynamic architecture.

“In the same way as the DisruptiveLab will be used to test hybridization for single-engine helicopters, we unveiled the PioneerLab with the aim of testing hybridization for twin-engine aircraft, as well as introducing bio-based materials,” Even stated.

The company also started assembling its CityAirbus NextGen eVTOL in Donauwörth, Germany, last year, and expects to carry out first flights of the novel aircraft in 2024.

Meanwhile, it’s FlightLab achieved a first in the helicopter industry when it successfully tested an electric flight control system that allowed for a single pilot stick to replace all three conventional pilot controls.

Looking ahead to 2024, Airbus said customer support remains one of its top priorities. The company has signed 140 new helicopters to its global support and HCare offering in 2023, bringing the total to 2,760 helicopters.

Airbus plans to release its 2023 full-year financial results on Feb. 15, 2024."
