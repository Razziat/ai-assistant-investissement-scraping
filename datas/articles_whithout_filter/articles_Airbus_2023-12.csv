Hybrid and electric flight - Airbus,"Tue, 05 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi9sb3ctY2FyYm9uLWF2aWF0aW9uL2h5YnJpZC1hbmQtZWxlY3RyaWMtZmxpZ2h00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Electric and hybrid-electric propulsion is rapidly revolutionising mobility technologies across industries, from automotive to marine. And the aviation industry is no exception. At Airbus, our work in electric flight aims to lay the groundwork for future industry-wide adoption and regulatory acceptance of alternative-propulsion commercial aircraft and urban air vehicles.

On the path to low-carbon flight A range of technologies are required in order to meet the aviation industry's decarbonisation ambition. These include improving operations and infrastructure; deploying sustainable aviation fuel (SAF); and innovating through technology. Radical shifts with new concepts in propulsion will continue to be developed, such as hybrid powered aircraft. It is a major challenge that the industry will answer collectively with engine manufacturers and other industries such as automotive. In November 2022, Airbus and Renault Group signed a research and development agreement which aims to leverage synergies to accelerate both companies’ electrification roadmaps. In June 2023, Airbus and STMicroelectronics signed an agreement to advance research on the next-generation of semiconductors, which are a key enabler of the aerospace industry’s transition to hybrid and full-electric aircraft like the ZEROe roadmap or the CityAirbus NextGen.

show more show less Energy is central to how we transform the aeronautics industry to achieve our decarbonisation ambition by 2050. The transformation follows two axes: Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) use increase and new electrical sources (battery and fuel cell). Hybridisation makes use of different energy sources. This combination helps optimise the overall energy efficiency of a flight and reduce fuel consumption.

Aircraft hybridisation principles In a hybrid configuration, the aircraft uses several energy sources in flight, either in tandem or alternately. The combination of energy sources - jet fuel or sustainable aviation fuels with electricity - enables us to optimise overall energy efficiency and reduce fuel consumption. Hybridisation leads to better energy management with the benefits of reducing fuel consumption by up to 5% compared to a standard flight. The electrical sources could come from batteries or fuel cells which convert hydrogen into electricity. In November 2022, Airbus unveiled its fuel cell-powered engine .

In flight, the aircraft uses several energy sources, either in tandem or alternately. The combination of energy sources - jet fuel or sustainable aviation fuels with electricity - enables us to optimise overall energy efficiency and reduce fuel consumption.

A timeline of achievements in electric propulsion In 2010, Airbus embarked on its electrification journey, developing the world’s first all-electric, four-engined aerobatic aircraft, CriCri. Since then, we have made significant progress in the electrification of flight thanks to our all-electric, twin-propeller aircraft E-Fan and our electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) demonstrator projects, Vahana and CityAirbus NextGen. E-Fan X, the successor to E-Fan has provided invaluable insights on serial hybrid-electric propulsion.

ASCENDing to new heights with cryogenic superconductivity - Airbus,"Wed, 13 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTEyLWFzY2VuZGluZy10by1uZXctaGVpZ2h0cy13aXRoLWNyeW9nZW5pYy1zdXBlcmNvbmR1Y3Rpdml0edIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ASCEND, Airbus’ superconductive powertrain demonstrator, has achieved a world first. Over the last three years, a small team of experts has developed and manufactured a cryogenic superconducting electric propulsion system purposely built to aerospace specifications.



In November 2023, ASCEND took its final step. The team successfully powered-on the 500 kilowatt powertrain at the system’s core. It’s an exciting breakthrough.

In the quest for cleaner transportation, the marriage of hydrogen-powered fuel cells and high temperature, or cryogenic, superconductivity could be a game changer.

The current density of superconducting tape is one hundred times that of a copper equivalent. Cryogenically freezing that tape enables it to carry electrical power from a fuel source to a propulsion system with practically no resistance.

That’s why, nestled inside a large warehouse just outside of Toulouse, France, Airbus UpNext’s Advanced Superconducting and Cryogenic Experimental powertraiN Demonstrator (ASCEND) team has spent the last three years exploring the impact of cryogenic superconductivity on the electrical infrastructure that could power the next generation of low-carbon aircraft.

This ASCEND-built electric motor receives power from superconducting tape which experiences next to no current loss, thanks to its very low resistance at cryogenic temperatures.

ASCEND concluded in November 2023 with the successful powering-on of a 500 kilowatt powertrain, consisting of superconducting tape, a cryogenic motor control unit and cooling system, and a superconducting motor. For context, getting the equivalent of today’s city-hopping turboprops off the ground using electric power alone would require around eight megawatts.

The ASCEND powertrain drove this superconducting electric motor during a successful power-on at Airbus’ E-Aircraft System testing facility in Ottobrunn, Germany.

Based on scientific research carried out by Airbus’ Central Research & Technology, the powertrain was developed at UpNext’s headquarters near Toulouse. Then for the final stage of the project, Airbus engineers put it through its paces at Airbus’ E-Aircraft System testing centre in Ottobrunn, Germany. It’s the largest facility of its kind in Europe. Culminating in the November power-on, the tests confirmed that it is possible to develop, assemble and control a complete superconducting and cryogenics chain built to aeronautical specifications.

This successful power run – a first for cryogenic technology in aerospace – is a step closer to real-world conditions. How did the ASCEND team get here?

Superconducting technology may seem like science fiction, but it has been around for decades. Today it is mainly used in medical imagery scanners; scientific experiments requiring a high magnetic field, such as CERN’s Large Hadron Collider; or ground transportation for electricity. However, testing facilities on the open market are few and the international ecosystem is immature.

“The technology we need already exists,” says ASCEND project head Ludovic Ybanez.



Our goal wasn’t to reinvent the wheel. It was to identify the best companies and research institutes and adapt their technology for application on board aircraft. We’ve worked closely with a network of over 20 partners to design a cryogenic powertrain that improves the efficiency of the electrical system by at least 4-5%.

Ludovic Ybanez, ASCEND project head Airbus UpNext



Airbus UpNext engineer Reda Abdouh peers into an ASCEND superconducting cryogenic test bench. When the liquid nitrogen it contains is released, the sudden chill causes air around it to condense.

As Airbus’ innovation lab, UpNext does things differently. Given the freedom and flexibility of a start-up, ASCEND’s engineers – who divide their time between UpNext’s Toulouse headquarters and Ottobrunn – hand-built the test bench environments with their German colleagues.

You’ll find some of these unassuming white boxes in a small back room inside that Toulouse warehouse. While they may look simple from the outside, the boxes house complex systems.

At about a metre and a half tall and resembling an outsized domestic appliance, each of these home-made devices are where the ASCEND team test how superconducting materials perform when exposed to an aircraft’s thermal cycles. The electrical resistance of such materials becomes zero when exposed to extremely low temperatures, usually below -170°C.

That might seem very cold but liquid nitrogen, widely used in industrial processes, is around -200°C. The powertrain components are exposed to repeated extreme thermal shock tests within these environments to determine the potential impact of cryogenics on the performance of electrical propulsion systems.

The Airbus UpNext team built their own electric demonstrator motor. ASCEND has shown it is possible for a superconducting powertrain to create a major power shift in electric propulsion, from several hundred kilowatts to multi-megawatts.

Conventional electric powertrains require a high voltage to limit power loss. On board an electric aircraft, a superconductive powertrain could reduce voltage and practically eliminate losses, while keeping the weight and size of the overall system in check. The conditions for superconductivity would be created by the same cryogenic process used to maintain liquid hydrogen on board the aircraft at -253°C, where the hydrogen is used to generate power through electrolysis inside a fuel cell.

A close-up of the superconducting tape, whose current density is one hundred times that of a copper equivalent.

After a halting start, the aerospace superconductivity ecosystem is maturing. As the ASCEND chapter closes, another opens. The race is on to mature and accelerate the technology in time to meet Airbus’ ambition of flying a hydrogen fuel-cell powered aircraft by 2035.

The ASCEND team used these test benches, designed and built in-house, to test the powertrain’s components by exposing them to extreme temperature cycles."

The demonstrator flew with its ePropellers activated, powered by a battery and a turbogenerator.

EcoPulse took off from Tarbes Airport on November 29, at 10:32 hrs CET for a test flight which lasted approximately 100 minutes. During the flight, the crew engaged the electric propellers and verified the proper functioning of the demonstrator's flight control computer, high-voltage battery pack, distributed electric propulsion and hybrid electric turbogenerator.

EcoPulse’s first hybrid flight is the culmination of several technical milestones, including extensive ground tests and 10 hours of flight tests of the aircraft with the electrical systems inactive.

“We confirmed today that this disruptive propulsion system works in flight, which paves the way for more sustainable aviation,” said Eric Dalbiès, Safran’s Executive Vice President Strategy and Chief Technology Officer. “The lessons learned from upcoming flight tests will feed into our technology roadmap and strengthen our position as leader in future all-electric and hybrid-electric propulsive systems.”

“This is a major milestone for our industry and we’re proud to have powered the EcoPulse demonstrator first flight with our new battery systems,” said Sabine Klauke, Chief Technical Officer at Airbus. High-energy density batteries will be necessary to reduce carbon emissions from aviation, whether for light aircraft, advanced air mobility or large hybrid-electric aircraft. Projects like EcoPulse are key to accelerating progress in electric and hybrid electric flight, and a cornerstone of our aim to decarbonize the aerospace industry as a whole.”

“The flight campaign will give Daher invaluable data on the effectiveness of the onboard technologies, including distributed propulsion, high-voltage batteries and hybrid-electric propulsion,” commented Pascal Laguerre, Chief Technology Officer at Daher. “We’re working to converge practical and significant know-how on design, certification and operation to shape our path toward more sustainable aircraft for the future.”

Unveiled at the 2019 Paris Air Show, EcoPulse is one of the major collaborative projects in Europe in the field of aviation decarbonization. It is supported by CORAC (the French Civil Aviation Research Council), and co-funded by DGAC (the French Civil Aviation Authority) through France Relance (the French government’s economy recovery plan) and NextGeneration EU. The demonstrator aims to evaluate the operational advantages of integrating hybrid-electric distributed propulsion, with specific emphasis on CO 2 emissions and noise level reduction. This disruptive propulsion architecture enables a single independent electrical source to power several engines distributed throughout the aircraft.

Based on a Daher TBM aircraft platform, EcoPulse is equipped with six integrated electric thrusters or e-Propellers (supplied by Safran), distributed along the wings. Its propulsion system integrates two power sources: a turbogenerator, i.e. an electric generator driven by a gas turbine (supplied by Safran), and a high-energy density battery pack (supplied by Airbus). At the heart of this architecture is a Power Distribution and Rectifier Unit (PDRU), responsible for protecting the high-voltage network and for distributing the available electrical power, as well as high-voltage power harnesses (both provided by Safran). The battery pack designed by Airbus is rated at 800 Volts DC and can deliver up to 350 kilowatts of power. The demonstrator also benefits from the aerodynamic and acoustic integration expertise of the European aircraft manufacturer. Airbus also developed the Flight Control Computer permitting aircraft maneuvers using the ePropellers, and synchrophasing to support future aircraft acoustic recommendations.

Note: the Ecopulse aircraft demonstrator will be showcased during the Green Aero Days organized in Pau (France) on December 6-7, 2023.

After initial preparation the panels will be dispatched to other Airbus sites before final integration and testing at Friedrichshafen. The Galileo G2 satellites are scheduled for launch in the coming years to support the initial deployment and validation of the G2 System.

Jean-Marc Nasr, Head of Space Systems at Airbus, said: “After the successful design phase we are now kicking off production in earnest of the state-of-the-art Galileo G2 satellites. Our teams in Friedrichshafen are working with engineers across Europe to meet the challenging schedule and finalise these sophisticated satellites which will further improve the global Galileo system opening up even more opportunities for services on Earth.”

To meet the demanding schedule to deliver all six satellites in less than two years, Airbus has developed a coordinated production programme to leverage the spacecraft manufacturing, integration, and testing expertise across Airbus sites including Backnang (near Stuttgart), Friedrichshafen, Madrid, Ottobrunn (near Munich) and Toulouse. The second satellite structure is due to arrive in early 2024 and the third towards the end of next year. Airbus’ modular approach to the manufacturing of the G2 satellites will see three spacecraft being produced in parallel at any one time.

The G2 satellites will incorporate enhanced navigation antennas which will help improve accuracy of the flagship European Global Navigation Satellite System. The spacecraft, equipped with electric propulsion for the first time and higher-strength navigation antennas, will also feature fully digital payloads which will be easily reconfigured in orbit, enabling them to actively respond to the evolving needs of users with novel signals and services.

Airbus Helicopters and German Armed Forces sign largest H145M contract - Airbus,"Thu, 14 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0xMi1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtYW5kLWdlcm1hbi1hcm1lZC1mb3JjZXMtc2lnbi1sYXJnZXN0LWgxNDVt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Donauwörth – The German Bundeswehr and Airbus Helicopters have signed a contract for the purchase of up to 82 multi-role H145M helicopters (62 firm orders plus 20 options). This is the largest order ever placed for the H145M and consequently the largest for the HForce weapon management system. The contract also includes seven years of support and services, ensuring optimal entry into service. The German Army will receive fifty-seven helicopters, while the Luftwaffe's special forces will receive five.



“We are proud that the Bundeswehr has decided to order up to 82 H145M helicopters”, said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters. “The H145M is a robust multi-role helicopter and the German Air Force has gained a significant amount of operational experience with its H145M LUH Special Operations Forces fleet. We will ensure that the Bundeswehr receives the helicopters in accordance with the very ambitious delivery schedule which includes first deliveries in 2024 less than a year after contract signature.”



The H145M is a multi-role military helicopter that provides a broad range of mission capabilities. Within minutes, the helicopter can be reconfigured from a light attack role with axial ballistic and guided weapons and a state-of-the-art self-protection system into a special operations version including fast rappelling equipment. The comprehensive mission packages include hoisting and external cargo capabilities. Additionally, the new German H145M includes options for future mission capabilities including the ability to operate with the integration of Manned-Unmanned Teaming and upgraded data links and communication systems.



The basic version of the ordered H145Ms will be equipped with fixed provisions, including the weapon management system, HForce, developed by Airbus Helicopters. This allows the Bundeswehr to train its pilots on the same type of helicopter that is used for operation and combat. Costly type transfers are eliminated and the highest level of professionalisation will be achieved.



The H145M is the military version of the tried-and-tested, light twin-engine H145 helicopter. The global fleet of the H145 family has now accumulated more than seven million flight hours. It is used by armed and law enforcement forces around the world for the most demanding missions. The Bundeswehr already operates 16 H145M LUH SOF and 8 H145 LUH SAR helicopters. The US Army employs almost 500 helicopters from the H145 family under the name of UH-72 Lakota. Current operators of the H145M are Hungary, Serbia, Thailand and Luxembourg; Cyprus has ordered six aircraft.

Airbus upgrades A400M firefighter prototype kit - Airbus,"Tue, 05 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0xMi1haXJidXMtdXBncmFkZXMtYTQwMG0tZmlyZWZpZ2h0ZXItcHJvdG90eXBlLWtpdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Getafe, Spain - 5 December 2023 – Airbus Defence and Space has conducted a new flight-test campaign of the A400M Roll-on/Roll-off firefighting prototype kit, dropping 20,000 litres of retardant and creating high concentration lines over 400 metres long on ground.

Over a period of two weeks, the A400M carried out a ground and flight-test campaign in south-western and central Spain, including six drops, three of which used red-coloured retardant and three using water.

“We have tested a new version of the kit, improving dropping efficiency and reducing discharge time by over 30% compared to last year, while combined with rapid deployment and easy installation on the A400M aircraft,” said Jean-Brice Dumont, Head of Military Air Systems at Airbus Defence and Space. “We continue to pioneer new solutions and capabilities for our A400M fleet, in this case protecting populations and natural environments from fires.”

An easy-to-install solution

This roll-on/roll-off kit does not require any modification to the aircraft and, therefore, is interchangeable to any aircraft in the A400M fleet. The water or retardant is stored in a tank in the cargo hold of the aircraft and, by using a mechanical lever, a door is opened to allow the liquid to flow out of the aircraft by gravity means through a discharge pipe. The current design of the prototype is capable of dropping 20,000 litres in a single discharge.

The tanks can be filled in less than 10 minutes using standard high-pressure pumps on ground. The A400M is characterised by its ability to take off and land on short and unpaved runways, and a wide range of air bases and airfields.

During the campaign, the 43rd Firefighting Squadron of the Spanish Air Force has been involved as technical advisors and assuring that this capability in the A400M has operational value for any potential operator.

In July 2022, Airbus tested a removable firefighting demonstrator kit on the A400M for the first time. The company concluded that the A400M firefighting kit offers additional capabilities not available on the market thanks to its high-dropping capacity, high manoeuvrability with the latest safety standards, day and night operation and the potential to convert any regular A400M in any fleet to a firefighting aircraft at very short notice.

About Elixir aircraft

Elixir Aircraft, a company based in La Rochelle with more than 80 employees, was created in 2015 to meet the challenges of the French light aviation sector. The objective of the French SME: to make safer, more economical, more environment-friendly and more versatile aircraft. Complexity is the current reason why older generation aircraft suffer from failures (technical or human) and are expensive to operate (fuel consumption and maintenance). Elixir Aircraft employs a technology from the world of competitive sailing, the Oneshot Carbon, to simplify the structures. More simplicity means fewer failures, therefore more safety, but also fewer maintenance, and lower costs (estimates of 40€/h of fuel and maintenance). At the end of 2021, Elixir Aircraft opened a new production site in order to internalize the entire production of carbon parts. Find out more at https://elixir-aircraft.com/en/

By the end of November 2023, Airbus’ highly successful A320 Family had already logged 1,395 orders, including the single largest order for 500 aircraft, from Indian airline Indigo. 2023 is following a trend: in 2022, the A320 Family logged 857 orders.

The market for single-aisle aircraft has bounced back strongly from the dark days of the COVID pandemic. Airlines worldwide particularly appreciate the modern, efficient and versatile A320 Family.

In recent years the Family’s largest model, the A321neo, has been successful both in terms of volumes and speed of sales. The variant accounts for around two-thirds of the 6,739 A320 Family aircraft in Airbus’ current order book.

To keep up with such strong demand, Airbus is growing its global industrial footprint with the goal of bringing A320 Family production up to 75 aircraft per month in 2026. At the same time, the company’s single-aisle final assembly lines (FALs) are evolving to produce a mix of aircraft models with new cabin and comfort standards.

Airbus is doubling the number of FALs capable of producing the A321neo, compared to 2019. By 2026, ten A320 Family FALs around the world will be capable of producing the A321neo.

In 2023, Airbus began construction of a second FAL in Mobile (USA) and in Tianjin (China). Toulouse (France) celebrated the inauguration of a FAL dedicated to the A321neo, with a second to follow. In Hamburg (Germany), where four FALs produce all members of the A320 Family, Airbus inaugurated a dedicated hangar to equip the A321 eXtra Long Range (XLR). With all locations now capable of assembling the A321neo, Airbus’ global single-aisle footprint is truly more flexible, resilient and closer to its customers.

This incredible ramp-up expands Airbus’ industrial footprint and is made possible by the thousands of people working at production sites around the world. The company is proud of this growing, multi-cultural family that makes up #TeamAirbus and the positive local impact its presence makes.

With more than 20 Airbus sites contributing to A320 Family production, Airbus continues to grow and onboard many newcomers to join this exciting journey. The ambitious plan for 2023 is to recruit circa 13,000 employees globally and it is progressing well, confirming Airbus attractivity. In addition to the traditional industrial skills - from manufacturing engineering, structures and systems to avionics - Airbus also attracts employees to critical jobs such as quality, logistic and supply chain specialists, customer line managers or digital manufacturing and cybersecurity specialists.

This growth is a strong sign of confidence in Airbus and the aviation industry as a whole. The A320 Family contributes to making further progress towards low-carbon aviation, offering a 20% fuel burn reduction compared to previous-generation aircraft."

ESA entrusts Airbus further for Earth observation standard reference TRUTHS mission - Airbus,"Mon, 04 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0xMi1lc2EtZW50cnVzdHMtYWlyYnVzLWZ1cnRoZXItZm9yLWVhcnRoLW9ic2VydmF0aW9uLXN0YW5kYXJk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has been awarded the latest phase in the European Space Agency (ESA) TRUTHS mission as part of ESA’s Earth Observation Earth Watch programme. The contract covers detailed definition of the mission and payload, and focuses on payload development and de-risking activities with an option for the procurement of long lead time hardware ahead of the full implementation phase following the 2025 ESA Ministerial budget meeting.

The TRUTHS satellite mission will measure the Sun’s radiation and the sunlight reflected off Earth's surface relative to an accurate reference, which will then be used to improve the climatological data sets and calibrate the observations of other satellites. This space-based climate and calibration observing system will enable data from other satellites to be compared more easily providing greater standards of data harmonisation for even more accurate climate change forecasts.

Jean Marc Nasr, Head of Space Systems at Airbus said: “This contract takes us one step closer to building a mission that will enable scientists and climatologists to cross reference their measurements and data enabling much more accurate forecasts and analysis in a shorter time. TRUTHS will provide the gold standard of calibration for space-based Earth observation – a kind of ‘standards laboratory in space’.”

UK Science, Research and Innovation Minister, Andrew Griffith, said: “This UK-led mission will have a global impact, providing invaluable measurements to improve our understanding of climate change. Overseen by Airbus-UK, this work is generating growth and developing important industrial capabilities across our space sector, driving forward our ambitions to make the UK a science and technology superpower.”

ESA’s Director of Earth Observation Programmes, Simonetta Cheli, said, “We are glad to award the contract to Airbus in the UK to take their work on developing TRUTHS into the next all-important phase. We see here at COP28 that the world is committed to climate action and having reliable data on which to base decisions is of the utmost importance. TRUTHS will be used as a benchmark so that data from other satellites can be compared more easily, thereby improving reliability.”

TRUTHS stands for Traceable Radiometry Underpinning Terrestrial and Helio Studies. This latest phase will include design definition of the mission and payload as well as commencing the build-up of the Industrial partners required to deliver such a complex payload while establishing optical Earth instrumentation expertise in the UK. This enhanced capability in the UK will enable Europe to benefit from a new skill set for Earth observation satellite missions in the future.

TRUTHS will carry a Cryogenic Solar Absolute Radiometer (CSAR) to provide a primary calibration standard in order to benchmark measurements of both incoming solar radiation and outgoing reflected radiation - measured with a Hyperspectral Imaging Sensor (HIS) also part of the payload - with unprecedented accuracy. These measurements will give the ability to estimate radiative imbalance underlying climate change and, importantly, in a shorter time than is currently possible. TRUTHS will serve to calibrate other satellite sensors, such as those carried on the Copernicus missions, through co-imaging operations.

TRUTHS is funded by a set of ESA member states, led by the UK, with the participation of the Czech Republic, Greece, Romania, Spain and Switzerland. Airbus is supported in the initial development of the satellite by partners including Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd, Teledyne e2v, National Physical Laboratory, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Deimos Space UK Ltd and AVS-UK Ltd, Thales Alenia Space Switzerland, Deimos Space SRL, Sener, and Integrated Systems Development. Further important contributions will be made by other companies and institutes from the participating nations.

The UK has embarked on a strategy to take a leadership role in this domain building on the strong climate science expertise from among others the National Physical Laboratory, the National Centre for Earth Observation and Rutherford Appleton Laboratory Space.

The A350F will join the airline’s cargo division, Cathay Cargo, and will become a central element in its future fleet, bringing new levels of efficiency across its extensive network.

Currently under development, the A350F can carry a payload of up to 111 tonnes and can fly up to 4,700 nautical miles / 8,700 kilometres at significantly lower cost than any other freighter available today. This will enable it to serve all heavy cargo markets, including the world’s biggest freight route between Hong Kong and Anchorage.

Cathay Group Chief Executive Officer Ronald Lam said: “As we move into 2024, our rebuild journey is gaining momentum. This order marks another major component in our investment for the future. It reflects Cathay’s confidence in the Hong Kong hub as we look ahead to the opportunities provided by the Three-Runway System.”

“These highly fuel-efficient, next-generation freighters will provide important additional cargo capacity, expand our global network and contribute to our sustainability leadership goals.”

Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer and Head of International said: “There's a new standard in the cargo space and we are gratified that such a savvy global air-cargo operator as Cathay has joined the growing number of reference players in the air-freight industry endorsing the A350F.”

“The aircraft will fit seamlessly with Cathay’s existing A350 passenger fleet, while lowering operating costs to a level never before seen in increasingly competitive cargo markets. At the same time, it will bring a very significant reduction in carbon emissions, contributing immediately to sustainability goals.”

Powered by latest technology Rolls-Royce Trent-XWB97 engines, the aircraft will bring a reduction in fuel consumption and carbon emissions of up to 40% when compared with the older 747F and is at least 20% more efficient than its competitor.

The A350F features the largest main deck cargo door in the industry, with fuselage length and capacity optimised around the industry’s standard pallets and containers. Over 70% of the airframe is made of advanced materials, resulting in a 46 tonne lighter take-off weight than the competing derivative. The A350F is also the only freighter aircraft that will fully meet ICAO’s enhanced CO₂ emissions standards, coming into effect in 2027.

As part of the world’s most modern widebody aircraft family, the A350F also offers a high level of commonality with A350 passenger aircraft, bringing added benefits to carriers already flying models from the family.

Cathay Group is already one of the largest operators of the A350, with a current fleet of 47 aircraft. These include both the A350-900 and A350-1000, which are primarily operated on the carrier’s long haul route network.

New legs for the Moon! - Airbus,"Mon, 18 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLTEyLW5ldy1sZWdzLWZvci10aGUtbW9vbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Technology required for interplanetary missions pushes engineering to its limits. Upcoming lunar missions will pave the way for humans to spend sustained periods on the Moon, investigating its surface and learning how to live and work there. Astrobotic’s Peregrine spacecraft is due to land on the lunar surface soon and Airbus’ technology will be instrumental in taking this next step on the Moon.

Peregrine, was developed by Astrobotic under NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Service (CLPS) initiative, and is scheduled for launch in 2024. Airbus was responsible for the layout, sizing, design, manufacture and qualification of the landing system. The four legs of the spacecraft will absorb the shock and stabilise Peregrine to enable the safe touchdown of this commercial mission onto the lunar surface.

Recently, the landing system for Astrobotic's next spacecraft, Griffin, has also been tested. Airbus engineers have contributed to the successful single-leg drop test campaign demonstrating the robust design of the landing system and load dampers. Landing success prediction, kinematics, mechanical design and load analysis, as well as the design and manufacture of touchdown sensors were carried out by Airbus. The extensive data collected during the tests was used to correlate the models for the multi-body simulation. “These models will enable us to simulate a very large number of landing cases, even extending beyond what can safely be demonstrated in a laboratory setup,” said Torsten Vogel, leading the Future and Robotic Missions team at Airbus in Bremen, Germany. “With this data we can analytically support the qualification of the mechanism through testing. This data will also be statistically evaluated to provide landing success probabilities for different landing site characteristics, taking into account rocks, small craters and slopes.”

On a test rig built and operated by Astrobotic, a landing leg was subjected to quasi-static friction tests and more than 10 drop tests covering a wide range of landing conditions on soft and hard ground. These activities were supported by Airbus engineers, who worked on-site as a fully integrated part of the Astrobotic team for two weeks to collect all the data needed to qualify the landing system. Excellent collaboration between NASA, Astrobotic and Airbus made for great teamwork.

With more than 10 years’ experience in landing system design and proprietary modelling and simulation tools, Airbus’ expertise is internationally recognised. The experience, workflow and toolchain of the landing systems team are also being used for Argonaut lunar lander activities which form part of Europe’s independent access to the lunar. Airbus is also supporting ESA’s Rosalind Franklin team in the dimensioning of a landing system to be designed and manufactured for the ExoMars mission, for which Airbus built the Mars rover.

The creation of a continuous human presence on the Moon will be crucial to building up operational experience in reliably supporting life away from Earth. The technology boost from this back on Earth could be phenomenal - as happened from the Apollo missions which ultimately led to the birth of Silicon Valley and the computers and smartphones we use today.

The Moon, our nearest neighbour, is the perfect escape route to our solar system, with enormous potential to be a source of scientific breakthroughs and economic growth. Over the next decade, the Artemis programme will lay the foundation for a sustained long-term presence on the lunar surface and use the Moon to validate deep space systems and operations before embarking on the much further voyage to Mars."

Safety Innovation #11: Preventing mid-air collisions with smart automation - Airbus,"Thu, 07 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTEyLXNhZmV0eS1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLTExLXByZXZlbnRpbmctbWlkLWFpci1jb2xsaXNpb25zLXdpdGgtc21hcnQtYXV0b21hdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In July 2002, a terrible mid-air collision between a passenger aircraft and a freighter over the town of Überlingen in Germany claimed 71 lives.

The ensuing investigation revealed several causes of the accident. In particular, it showed that although both aircraft were equipped with a traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) and that each TCAS had alerted the crew, the alerts had not prevented the disaster as the air traffic control (ATC) and TCAS instructions were different. In the absence of a clear and uniformly shared communication and procedure in the event of an alert, the human reactions had not been consistent.

This situation prompted the aeronautical industry to rethink its approach. ICAO and national airworthiness authorities decided that TCAS orders would take precedence over ATC instructions.

Airbus decided to implement an additional technical innovation. To help crews, Airbus developed the AP/FD TCAS function (Auto-Pilot/ Flight Directors – Traffic Collision Avoidance System), which enables the autopilot to automatically perform an immediate optimal avoidance manoeuvre, avoiding excessive or incorrect crew reactions.

Thanks to this system, the autopilot executes the climb or descent instructions given by the TCAS under the monitoring of the crew who can notify ATC of the manoeuvre performed and when the aircraft are “cleared of conflict”, for the utmost safety of the aircraft and its passengers.

EcoPulse demonstrator takes first flight with batteries onboard - Airbus,"Tue, 05 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTEyLWVjb3B1bHNlLWRlbW9uc3RyYXRvci10YWtlcy1maXJzdC1mbGlnaHQtd2l0aC1iYXR0ZXJpZXMtb25ib2FyZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"EcoPulse is a distributed hybrid-propulsion demonstrator aircraft co-developed by Airbus, Daher and Safran. Designed to learn and mature the technological bricks of hybrid-electric propulsion systems for future aircraft, EcoPulse reached a milestone when the demonstrator took off on its first test flight.

After a couple of years of travelling between Tarbes and Toulouse on a regular basis to oversee EcoPulse’s development, project leader William Llobregat found himself back onsite in November 2023 with his team, and those of Daher and Safran. The occasion? The first EcoPulse test flight. “This project was launched in 2019,” says Llobregat, a next-generation propulsion architect. “It’s really exciting to have reached the concrete stage of the project where we are flight testing the technologies we have developed.”

EcoPulse first hybrid flight test video

The first flight marks the beginning of an eight-month flight testing campaign of the distributed hybrid-propulsion systems and the associated technologies, led by Daher. A hybrid-electric propulsion system combines a high-voltage battery with a turbomachine equipped with an electrical generator, and the distributed aspect means there are multiple propulsion “pods” spread along the wings.

Hybridisation is an important investment area for Airbus as estimates show that it could reduce an aircraft’s environmental footprint up to 5%. The EcoPulse first flight, with the functional hybrid-propulsion system aboard, thus marks a major, concrete step in advancing the company’s electrification roadmap.

A milestone for hybrid-electric flight

EcoPulse took off for its inaugural test flight from the scenic Tarbes–Lourdes–Pyrénées Airport, nestled at the foot of the Pyrénées mountain range in southwest France. Two experimental Daher pilots were onboard the demonstrator, a modified Daher TBM 900 turboprop aircraft. While take off and landing used the traditional propulsion engine, the hybrid-propulsion system was activated at cruising altitude, where the pilots spent around 20 minutes running testing sequences on the battery while it was powering the flight.

All aspects of the different systems, from the way the aircraft responds to the way the power sources are used, were previously simulated digitally and tested by the pilots on the ground. This theoretical data can now be compared with the real flight test data to help the teams better refine the simulator and improve the performance of the different innovative technology components.

Which technology components, you may ask? Airbus, Daher and Safran divided the responsibilities of developing the different EcoPulse technologies based on their complementary expertises. Airbus’ contributions to the demonstrator are the development of the high-energy-density battery that powers the propulsors; the aerodynamic and acoustic integration of the distributed-propulsion system; and the development of a flight control computer system.

“Technological demonstrators like Ecopulse play a key role in advancing our industry's decarbonisation roadmap,” says Llobregat. “The demonstrators themselves are not intended to ever enter into service, but they allow us to evaluate, mature and validate individual technologies that can then be integrated into future aircraft.”

This voltage is a first for the aerospace industry and we hope to one day integrate this technology into commercial aircraft.

William Llobregat, EcoPulse project leader and next-generation propulsion architect

Airbus brings expertise to key EcoPulse components

Of Airbus’ three main technology contributions, the battery system may be the most groundbreaking. As automobile batteries for electric vehicles are too heavy and bulky to have aerospace uses, and those batteries already in use on aircraft are typically low-voltage, the high-voltage battery on EcoPulse had to be custom designed by Airbus Defence and Space. “The battery system is able to achieve 800 Volts DC and deliver up to 350 kilowatts of power,” says Llobregat. “We are pioneering new voltage levels for the aerospace industry and we hope to one day integrate this technology into commercial aircraft.” The battery is powerful enough to drive up to six electric propulsors.

Airbus also modified the shape of the aircraft to assess the performance impact of having a distributed propulsion system. “We have separate, smaller sources of propulsion distributed across the wing. This means that you could theoretically increase the thrust on only the outboard engines, or just the centre ones. We can then assess how these differences impact flight performance, which is very valuable data,” explains Llobregat. “Using asymmetrical thrust to control the aircraft is a totally new technology that is only possible to test out because we are using an electrical system that has better dynamic response than traditional jet fuel engines.

The creation of a flight control computer system also fell to Airbus. The software links all the flight control systems and connects them to the electrical engines, monitoring the propulsion. It optimises thrust and minimises the wingtip drag effect, and it also takes into account an extra control stick in the cockpit as well as an emergency shutdown button that immediately returns the demonstrator to a normal aircraft with a native engine.

Laying the groundwork for battery-powered flight

Flight testing of the demonstrator will last until mid-2024 at the latest, and will include up to 30 test flights. The ultimate goal for the teams involved? That each company will walk away from the project having achieved their respective objectives. “This partnership between Airbus, Daher and Safran – three French companies – worked so well because it was founded on our common ambition of paving the path to decarbonisation for the European aerospace industry,” Llobregat says.

As one of Airbus’ primary project objectives was testing a new high-voltage battery configuration in flight, the testing campaign is the exciting result of four years of work. However, the development of the battery system stretches back even further, with the EcoPulse battery benefiting from several years of previous research and prototyping at Airbus and Airbus Helicopters. The flight testing of this state-of-the-art battery system – lightweight and compact, with high voltage and energy density – will provide valuable data to support Airbus’ goal of applying hybrid propulsion systems to future aircraft or helicopters. While EcoPulse may be a small aircraft, its potential impact on the aviation industry is therefore huge!"

"2024 brings new airplanes, seats and airport improvements to passengers - CNN","Thu, 28 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2F2aWF0aW9uLWRldmVsb3BtZW50cy0yMDI0L2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSATlodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi90cmF2ZWwvYXZpYXRpb24tZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnRzLTIwMjQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

Passengers will fly in 2024 with airlines that are putting their post-lockdown plans into place. And that includes shiny new airplanes containing new seat designs arriving at a rapid pace.

A scattering of new airports and terminals will change the game in a few key regions, although some routes and airplanes will be delayed into 2025 or further because of supply chain difficulties.

Let’s start with those new airports and terminals before taking a look at the airplane deliveries and new seats.

A big new terminal and a major airport upgrade

Abu Dhabi International Airport, home to Etihad Airways, fully opened its Terminal A in late 2023 after much delay. This enormous facility is a huge improvement and will allow Etihad to offer much improved connections, a much more pleasant space for passengers and new lounges as the carrier expands into 2024.

Meanwhile, at Los Angeles’ LAX, the biggest news is outside the terminals — sort of. The Automated People Mover train system at the airport has taken five years to complete with six stations, connecting the terminals with the new rental car facility, ride-hailing zones, parking lots and the new Metro Transit Center station for the local C and K Metro Rail lines.

It’s a massive improvement and will hopefully go a long way toward reducing the airport’s traffic snarls when it opens in 2024.

Across the world, expect to see a number of quality-of-life improvements to airports rolling out, such as more of the new bag scanners that mean you don’t have to take liquids or electronics out in security lines and more integrated airline and airport apps that reduce queueing times and speed up boarding.

New small planes will make a big difference onboard

The big news is in little planes — well, not that little.

The Airbus A321XLR is the longest-range version of Airbus’ A320neo family of single-aisle planes, with XLR standing for “extra long range” of 4,700 nautical miles or roughly nine to 10 hours of flying. After some delays, it’s expected to start flying in late 2024.

You might be familiar with the A320neo from shorter flights of a few hours, but the XLR version can fly as far as a much bigger plane – and more economically for airlines. Its extra long range opens up a lot of routes known as “long and thin”: the ones with too little passenger demand for a big plane, but too far for previous versions of the small planes to fly.

“If everything goes well, I think this will really change the city pairs that would be served, and it could bring additional frequency to existing routes, so I think this aircraft will bring a lot of convenience,” said Flavien Tête, co-founder and chief executive officer of the popular flight review website Flight-Report.com.

The relatively small plane compared with big widebodies “also means shorter boarding and deboarding times,” Tête told CNN Travel, “and also new cabins. The narrow-body cabin was not necessarily designed for full flat seats or premium economy seats, and these were not really optimized for the [previous] narrow-body fleet. So with the A321XLR, we’re really going to see brand new seats, brand new ambience — we’ll feel very cozy.”

Onboard the A321XLR, the big news will be in business class, where you’ll find big new suites with doors, along the lines of what JetBlue has done with its Airbus A321LR (“long range”) in starting flights to Europe. New suites such as Stelia’s Opera and Safran’s Vue will arrive, leapfrogging older business class seats in comfort terms.

In economy, expect the same kind of fully featured seats with big entertainment screens, power sockets and inflight WiFi options that you’re used to on long flights. Newer seats such as the Recaro CL3810 also sculpt away some of the support structures at knee and shin level to give you a bit of extra legroom.

In Australia, Qantas will take its first A321XLRs in 2024, and the airline is already starting to take its first Airbus A220 airplanes, replacing elderly Boeing 717s and adding space and features to its regional experience.

A flock of new big planes mean new seats and services

A Japan Airlines Airbus A350-1000 Airbus

As airlines accelerate away from the pandemic downturn, the new planes they ordered are starting to arrive, featuring new cabins and new seats.

Japan Airlines will start operating its first Airbus A350-1000 in January 2024, initially to New York and later in the spring to Dallas-Fort Worth as well. With luxurious first class suites, big business suites, upmarket premium economy and some of the most spacious economy seats in the sky, this is an airplane to watch out for.

Watch out — or listen out — also for the new headrest speakers in first and business class seats, launched on these JAL A350s. This is Safran’s Euphony system, which adjusts automatically to account for cabin noise so that whatever you’re listening to isn’t audible outside your own suite. It’s not meant for swelling orchestral or cinematic masterpieces, but it’s superb for falling asleep to a documentary or podcast without a big headset (or losing a Bluetooth earbud down the side of your seat).

Lufthansa, meanwhile, is due to introduce its Allegris generation of products, with new seats in first, business, premium and economy, bringing its onboard experience up to date. Production delays, however, mean there may be some extra time to wait for the experience.

Air India is also getting the first A350s that it designed itself, fresh from its rebrand with lovely new airplane paint jobs and superb new uniforms from fashion designer Manish Malhotra. While the airline has been taking a few A350s previously intended for Russia’s Aeroflot in late 2023, these will be the first all-Air-India-designed cabins, with new seats throughout.

Emirates, too, gets its first A350 in mid-2024, which will have new seats that have yet to be unveiled. The Dubai-based airline is also planning on replacing seats on its older Boeing 777 airplanes with a new business class product — not a moment too soon given the age of the seats on these aircraft.

American Airlines adds to the list of new seats, for both smaller narrow-body and larger wide-body airplanes.

More widely, Airbus will be ramping up deliveries of its “NPS” or “New Production Standard” A350s, which offer a slightly updated cabin.

For passengers, this means thinner side walls and more space for galley kitchens, meal storage, lavatories and crew areas at the front and back of the plane.

For airlines that keep their current 3-3-3 seat layout, this is good news for passengers: the 4-inch-wider cabins mean a little more shoulder room. But some airlines, reportedly including Etihad based in Abu Dhabi, are adding in a 10th seat to every economy row.

But it’s not all bad news for economy: Air New Zealand will launch its Skynest bunks in 2024 on flights to New York and Chicago, with six pods that let passengers grab some much-needed shut-eye. The airline expects to charge between $400 to $600 for a four-hour snooze.

In economy, aircraft cabin designer Daniel Baron, the managing director of Lift Aero Design in Tokyo, tells CNN that “the post-Covid era is an overflowing river of complaints about the customer experience, reflecting frustration with eternal lines at airports, mishandled baggage, packed lounges, fees for things that used to be free, and compact living space in always-full economy class.”

“As a strategy to help mitigate the pain points,” Baron predicts, “airlines will be investing more in the back of the bus, with greater seat comfort, snazzier aesthetics and free connectivity. The creature features include better seat cushions and brighter colors, plus snack counters and mood lighting. It is very important for airlines to deliver tangible, relevant enhancements that keep people interested in flying.”

All of these new planes mean that airlines can choose to replace their older fleets or expand to new destinations.

Keep an eye out as schedules are announced, especially for intercontinental flights — the transatlantic and transpacific routes are seeing a lot of new nonstop services pop up, which may be much more convenient."

CityAirbus NextGen eVTOL set to power on - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 18 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvY2l0eWFpcmJ1cy1uZXh0Z2VuLWV2dG9sLXNldC10by1wb3dlci1vbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With an operational range of 80 km and a cruise speed of 120 km/h, the CityAirbus NextGen has been developed to be suited for a range of deployments in urban areas and beyond.

Airbus is expecting to power on its CityAirbus NextGen eVTOL prototype before the end of the year, with the aircraft in the final stages of assembly at Airbus Helicopters’ facility in Donauworth, Germany.

“It’s now out of the jig — it’s on skids, the wing, tail, and propellers are there, and the battery pack has arrived,” Balkiz Sarihan, head of urban air mobility (UAM) at Airbus, told Vertical. “Literally every day there’s something new coming in.”

The CityAirbus NextGen program was launched in 2021, following on from Airbus’s CityAirbus and Vahana demonstration programs. The aircraft is powered by eight propellers and 16 electrical power units, with dual systems for redundancy. It will carry one pilot with three passengers in a banked seat at the rear of the cabin.

The multi-rotor aircraft has been in assembly throughout 2023 in preparation for the start of its flight test campaign in 2024. The first phases of this campaign will take place in a 10,700-square-foot (1,000-square-meter) dedicated eVTOL test center in Donauworth, which itself has been built over the year.

The ability to begin the campaign indoors will ensure against any weather-related challenges that would otherwise be presented by the German winter, said Sarihan.

“Then we continue to open up the flight test envelope as you would expect us to do on any other product,” she said.

In addition to a main hangar, the test center includes separate rooms for subsystem testing. The grand opening of the facility will be held “sometime in the new year,” said Sarihan, along with a first public display of the prototype.

The flight test campaign is due to take place throughout 2024, in parallel with the maturation of various technologies set to be incorporated into the aircraft, such as the “Millennium” single stick control and Vertex autonomy system.

“This parallel path really saves us quite a lot of time and investment,” said Sarihan.

Airbus has been clear from the outset that its plan is to enter the eVTOL market with a piloted product, but the initial test phase of CityAirbus NextGen will be remotely piloted.

In addition to the flight test campaign, the upcoming year will see Airbus continue working on the broader eVTOL ecosystem.

The company has partnered with 30 organizations and companies — including the state and federal government, technology companies, universities and Munich airport — to establish what it calls the Air Mobility Initiative (AMI) in Bavaria. Together, they’re developing and testing a full urban air mobility ecosystem, from defining a concept of operations (ConOps), to building the first version of a vertiport.

“We will actually start to fly subscales in the exact missions of the eVTOL next year,” said Sarihan. “This will be the first test of the ConOps’ design.”

The company also expects to build upon its existing pool of global partnerships, having already announced agreements with Chilean operator Ecocopter, Saudi Arabia’s The Helicopter Company, and Japanese operator Hiratagakuen to better understand the urban air mobility markets in those regions.

Earlier this year, Airbus announced a partnership with the Norwegian Air Ambulance Foundation to explore the use of CityAirbus NextGen in the emergency medical services (EMS) mission.

“What we’re working on is not only how they would like the aircraft to evolve in future generations, but how an eVTOL will fit into an existing working HEMS system,” said Sarihan.

Early discussions with the foundation showed that they think eVTOLs might best be used to deliver medical care rather than to transport patients, she revealed.

“[For the foundation], the interest of the eVTOL is in rapid deployment of the right medication, right personnel and the right intervention,” she said. “It’s not replacing [helicopters or ground ambulances], but it’s providing an extra layer of service.”

While 2024 will be another year of major development for the CityAirbus NextGen eVTOL, it will also be a momentous year for the wider eVTOL industry, with fellow manufacturer Volocopter aiming to launch commercial services in Paris at the 2024 Summer Olympics. Sarihan said Airbus will be watching with great interest.

“All of this puts a lot of attention, a lot of excitement, a lot of energy and some funding as well [towards the eVTOL sector],” she said. “But we also have to make sure that all of these [commercial launches] are executed really, really well. Everybody wants it to go smoothly, to go safely, to excite the public to show the first demonstration, and then keep them with us for the next step.”"

Lufthansa Group joins Airbus' carbon-removal initiative - newsroom.lufthansagroup.com,"Wed, 06 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20ubHVmdGhhbnNhZ3JvdXAuY29tL2VuL0x1ZnRoYW5zYS1Hcm91cC1qb2lucy1BaXJidXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Lufthansa Group signed a contract with Airbus on the pre-purchase of verified and durable carbon-removal credits of 40,000 tonnes of CO₂. A promising solution for reducing CO₂ in the atmosphere, Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS) technology filters CO₂ from the air and stores it permanently. The Lufthansa Group began exploring this innovative process at an early stage and deems it perfectly complementing the Group’s sustainability strategy.

The carbon-removal credits will be issued by Airbus through its ACCO (Airbus Carbon Capture Offer) service. The certificates will be available from 2026 and an annual purchase of carbon-removal credits of 10,000 tonnes of CO₂ has been agreed on over a period of four years. The signing of the contract follows a joint declaration of intent from 2022.

“The Lufthansa Group is strongly committed to making air transport more sustainable and achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. This includes billion-euro investments in continuous fleet modernization and our strong commitment to Sustainable Aviation Fuels. Technical CO₂ removal solutions, like advanced and direct carbon capture and storage processes, will play a complementary role in achieving our decarbonization goals,” said Caroline Drischel, Head of Corporate Responsibility at the Lufthansa Group.

“The Lufthansa Group was one of the very first aviation companies to work with Airbus to explore the potential of direct air carbon capture and storage solutions,” said Nicolas Chrétien, Head of Environment & Sustainability at Airbus. “As the aviation industry moves towards net zero CO₂-emissions by 2050, carbon removal will play an important role in addressing remaining emissions. We are very pleased to go one step further with the Lufthansa Group and keep up the momentum to make decarbonized air travel a reality.”

This is how DACCS technology works

Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage is a high-potential technology that involves filtering CO₂ emissions directly from the air using high powered fans. Once removed from the air, the CO₂ is stored deep underground in geologic saline formations. As the aviation industry cannot capture CO₂ emissions released into the atmosphere at source, a direct air carbon capture and storage solution would allow the sector to extract CO₂ emissions from its operations directly from atmospheric air. In addition to the comprehensive measures that companies are taking to reduce CO₂ emissions, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), carbon removal is required to support the achievement of net-zero targets.

Additionally, the Direct Air Carbon Capture technology will be an important building block for the production of next-generation Sustainable Aviation Fuels. For SAF production from renewable energies with the innovative Power-to-Liquid or Sun-to-Liquid technologies, for example, CO₂ is captured from the atmosphere and processed further. For this, a Direct Air Capture infrastructure will be needed. In IATA’s Infrastructure Roadmap, the development and the promised success of SAF are closely linked to the adoption of Direct Air Capture infrastructures. The Lufthansa Group is involved in numerous initiatives to bring these promising next generation SAF technologies to market maturity.

The Airbus carbon-removal initiative is based on Airbus’ partnership with 1PointFive that includes the pre-purchase of carbon-removal credits of 400,000 tonnes of CO₂ to be delivered over four years. The US-based company is working closely with leading organizations to develop practical pathways to achieve global climate targets.

Lufthansa Group pursues ambitious sustainability goals

The Lufthansa Group has set itself ambitious climate protection goals and aims to achieve a neutral CO₂ balance by 2050. Already by 2030, the Lufthansa Group wants to halve its net CO₂ emissions compared to 2019 through reduction and compensation measures. The reduction share of the 2030 target was validated by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in August 2022. The Lufthansa Group was the first airline group in Europe with a science-based CO₂ reduction target in line with the goals of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. For effective climate protection, the Lufthansa Group is focusing, in particular, on accelerated fleet modernization, the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), the continuous optimization of flight operations, and offers for its private travelers and corporate customers to make a flight or the transport of cargo more sustainable. In addition, the Lufthansa Group has been actively supporting global climate and weather research for many years. The Lufthansa Group's commitment to sustainability is rated positively and above the industry average by independent rating organizations."
Germany spends $2.3 billion on Airbus light attack helicopters - Defense News,"Thu, 14 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9nbG9iYWwvZXVyb3BlLzIwMjMvMTIvMTQvZ2VybWFueS1zcGVuZHMtMjMtYmlsbGlvbi1vbi1haXJidXMtbGlnaHQtYXR0YWNrLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"COLOGNE, Germany — The German Defence Ministry has signed a contract with Airbus for 62 H145M light attack helicopters, with a portion of the fleet equipped to fight tanks from afar — a direct lesson from the fighting in Ukraine.

Under the order, 57 of the aircraft will go to the Army and five to Air Force special operations forces. Twenty more are envisioned under a future option, Airbus Helicopters said in a Dec. 14 statement. Deliveries will begin in 2024, according to the vendor.

German lawmakers approved the requisite funding request of €2.1 billion (U.S. $2.3 billion) on Dec. 13. All aircraft will be capable of carrying an armaments package that is slated to include the Spike LR guided anti-tank missile, but only 24 will initially be set up to that end, according to parliamentary defense sources in Berlin that spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the topic.

The purchase, including the envisioned anti-tank capabilities, comes against the backdrop of new insights into the requirement for standoff capabilities when countering tanks. In Ukraine, Russian helicopters were able to pick off Ukrainian armored vehicles by firing their missiles from a safe distance.

The latest version of the Spike LR missile, an Israeli design marketed by Eurospike in Europe, can reach targets 10 kilometers (6 miles) away when fired from helicopters, according to the manufacturer.

“We will ensure that the Bundeswehr [German military] receives the helicopters in accordance with the very ambitious delivery schedule which includes first deliveries in 2024 less than a year after contract signature,” said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters.

The new helicopters are slated to replace Germany’s fleet of Tiger choppers. Despite the hefty buy, defense officials consider the H145M fleet a “bridging solution” until a new generation of drones and loitering munitions are ready for fielding in the longer term.

The H145M is a military-specific derivative of a family of helicopters also available to the law enforcement market. The German military already operates 24 of the twin-engine aircraft for special operations as well as search and rescue missions, an Airbus statement read. The U.S. Army’s 500-strong fleet of Lakota light utility helicopters is based on the same design.

Airbus Photo

Tomasz Krysinski, head of research and innovation at Airbus Helicopters, has provided more details about the company’s groundbreaking single stick control system, recently tested on the manufacturer’s FlightLab demonstrator.

Dubbed the “Millennium stick” by Airbus engineers, the system replaces the three conventional pilot controls — cyclic, collective and pedals — with a single stick that can be operated with one hand.

The idea is to allow for a simplification of piloting and control of all aircraft axes. With the single Millennium stick, pilots can perform all required maneuvers — from takeoffs, climbs and accelerations, to decelerations, turns, descents and landings.

Krysinski described the stick as allowing “control by objective.”

“You fix the objective: If you want to go forwards, the computer . . . adds on all the controls the appropriate inputs to go forward [while maintaining straight and level flight],” he told Vertical. “If you want to go up, it’s exactly the same. It makes the control of the aircraft much easier.”

A close-up view of the controller has not been provided by Airbus, and Krysinski would not go into specifics as to how it looks, but said “it’s been done very naturally.”

He said many pilots within Airbus have had the opportunity to test the system out during trials, providing crucial feedback as to how they felt using the Millenium stick both in terms of comfort and ease of use.

“What we noticed is that pilots get familiar with it very, very easily,” said Krysinski.

In addition to simplifying piloting, the Millennium stick also takes up less room in the cockpit, resulting in the added benefit of improved visibility.

The test system in FlightLab used electric actuators to pull the flight controls of the modified H130. In case of any issue, a safety pilot in the aircraft had the ability to switch to a traditional flight control system with the push of a button.

The system is reliant on information gathered by the suite of sensors FlightLab carries, including a gyro-stablized camera for image detection (known as the eye for autonomous guidance and landing extension, or EAGLE), and two lidars.

“Helicopters, for years, were very focused on the vehicle,” said Krysinski. “The pilot has all the information about what is going on with the engines, avionics and the [aircraft’s] position. Now, the focus with this new generation of sensors — the lidars, radars, cameras, [and] numerical maps — is what is going on outside.”

Regarding the future use of the technology, Krysinski said its development has mainly been driven by the company’s need for a simplified control system for its urban air mobility efforts (currently focused on the CityAirbus NextGen demonstrator).

As to whether future “traditional” rotorcraft could see a new control interface, Krysinski said the Millennium stick was simply one of several “technobricks” in development — and its uptake depends on the appetite of the company’s program teams, which in turn is informed by market considerations.

The trails of the Millennium stick were followed by tests of Airbus’s Vertex autonomy system, which saw pilots controlling the aircraft with a tablet. With the tablet, pilots simply need to input where they want to go and tap their approval for different phases of flight. They can leave the aircraft to manage the rest, from takeoff to landing — or adjust various paramenters, such as speed, altitude, or route. The aircraft will accommodate these as long as it is safe to do so.

“Also, if you have for instance some kind of a failure — whatever it is — the system automatically shows to the pilot their landing area and the aircraft lands automatically in this area, taking the appropriate trajectory,” said Krysinski.

During the tests, Airbus has had the chance to put a sense-and-avoid function through its paces. This system works by automatically detecting obstacles using the aircraft’s lidars and a map database.

“It’s experimental, of course, but really we did it deliberately to open new mission capabilities,” said Krysinski. “We will not replace the pilot — that’s not the target. The target is to make the pilot focus really on the mission and replace effort to make piloting the aircraft easier.”"
Trapp aiming to make Airbus Helicopters' customer support best in industry - Vertical Magazine,"Fri, 08 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvdHJhcHAtYWltaW5nLXRvLW1ha2UtYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLWN1c3RvbWVyLXN1cHBvcnQtYmVzdC1pbi1pbmR1c3RyeS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Romain Trapp has been working as EVP of customer support and services at Airbus Helicopters since Sept. 1, 2023. Brent Bundy Photo

Romain Trapp, Airbus Helicopters’ newly-appointed executive vice-president of customer support and services, is refreshingly candid when discussing the challenge before him and the manufacturer. He is also unflinchingly ambitious in terms of setting targets.

“Airbus is known for having great products, pioneering . . . our DNA is to innovate, to improve our products every time,” he told Vertical. “We are not known for offering the best service. Why? I’m shooting for the moon here, and this is what I want to target. It is going to take a lot of time, because we are not where we need to be.”

Trapp started in the role Sept. 1, after spending 15 years working for Airbus in North America. There, he worked as chief financial officer at the U.S. subsidiary, Airbus Helicopters, Inc. (AHI), then as president of Airbus Helicopters Canada, and finally as president of AHI and head of the North America region.

When he started his tenures as president of the Canadian and U.S. subsidiaries, he made it a priority each time to hit the road and meet as many of the manufacturer’s customers as possible, as soon as possible. It’s a trick he’s repeating now he’s back in France at the company’s rotary-wing headquarters.

The week before sitting down with Vertical at European Rotors in Madrid, Spain, Trapp was in Malaysia speaking with customers from across southeast Asia. The following week he was due to meet customers in India.

“I want to make sure I meet and create this human contact with all our customers,” he said. “That’s key for me also to understand the differences — the differences in culture, the differences in the way they operate the helicopters — which exist from one region to another.”

Support and services represents about 50 percent of Airbus Helicopters’ turnover, and employs about 5,000 people. When not on the road meeting customers over the last three months, he has been busy meeting his team. “I’ve not met all 5,000 people yet, but I’m working towards that,” he said with a smile.

In discussing the challenges his team are facing, he said the state of the supply chain remains the major issue for the entire aerospace industry, with Airbus Helicopters no exception.

While the manufacturer has invested €400 million over the last three years in additional stock and materials, issues remain with “a few critical parts” Trapp said.

To combat this, Airbus has a team of 20 people working full-time at supplier facilities to help increase production. And, with some suppliers — such as German dynamic component manufacturer ZF Luftfahrttechnik — Airbus has gone one step further to control the flow of parts by purchasing the supplier themselves and making them a wholly owned subsidiary.

Perhaps one of the more eye-catching methods the airframer is using to enhance its supply of parts is a program that sees it offer to buy used aircraft in order to part them out. Over the last year, it has bought back 20 helicopters through this program — known as Phenics — and Trapp said Airbus was targeting the purchase of “at least” 30 used helicopters next year. These 30 aircraft, he said, represent about 3,000 parts, which will be used to increase the pool of spares for customer support.

The types Airbus has purchased to date span the breadth of its fleet, including H120s, H135s, H155s and H225s.

Trapp said he hopes to raise awareness of the program, as many customers appear unaware that it exists. To take part, customers simply have to contact the manufacturer to gauge their interest. But, as Trapp said, there “has to be a business case” for aircraft to be accepted.

“For instance, a helicopter which is 10 years old — there is no business case. There is no value in it [for the program],” he said. “The parts we harvest have to be of some value, either by themselves, or because they’re part of something bigger that we require.”

Another major market trend is an uptick in the number of customers signing up for HCare — Airbus’s support-by-the-hour program, in which operators pay a fee per flight hour to guarantee a certain level of parts availability and maintenance support.

“These parts-by-the-hour contracts are a means for operators to secure their ability to perform their missions,” said Trapp. “It’s a commitment from us, the manufacturer, to provide parts and repair when the customer needs it.”

He said the uptake of these contracts was strongest among operators flying H135s and heavier types, and was proving particularly popular among those working in the air medical and utility sectors.

The wider aerospace industry has placed a focus on increased digitalization over the last few years, offering operators greater convenience and easier access to the tools and information they need to do their jobs. Trapp said over 1,200 helicopters from the Airbus global fleet are now fully connected in terms of data transfer to the manufacturer.

“The goal of digitalization, of connected services — whatever the word we want to use — is to allow operators to fly more and safer . . . using all this data from Airbus Helicopters,” he said.

However, he also cautioned that it was important to retain the human element in interactions between manufacturer and customer.

“We are a people-to-people industry, and sometimes digitalization can give the feeling that there is nobody in front of you,” he said. “It’s very important that we continue creating a very strong link between our operators and maintaining the human contact. Digitalization is a tool — it’s nothing else. It’s a tool to make your work more efficient, but the human contact part is fundamental.”

Training services also fall under Trapp’s responsibility, and he said digitalization has a role to play in bringing greater proximity to the company’s customers. The company is also embracing new training technology, such as virtual reality flight simulators, to help improve access for its customers. After signing a partnership agreement with Loft Dynamics, Airbus has deployed 15 of its virtual reality simulators around the world — some at its own facilities, and others bought directly by customers.

“We need to find ways to train more people, and for that you need to bring tools closer to the customer,” said Trapp. “A virtual reality simulator is a way to train — it’s not the only one and it’s not enough on its own — it has to be complimentary within flight training. But it’s a good first step.”

Looking ahead, Trapp said the only way to achieve his aim of having Airbus become known for the best customer service was through disruption.

He said the traditional approach to solving a problem is to launch a wide variety of actions — but said the more actions you take, the less effective they tend to be, as they simply spread the effort too thinly.

“I want us to focus on what really brings the difference, and I’m never looking at a five percent improvement or a 10 percent improvement,” said Trapp. “What I’m asking the team is, ‘Let’s bring ideas that are disruptive ideas, that can bring a 50 percent improvement.’

“When you say that to someone, of course the first reaction is, ‘OK, this guy is dreaming.’ And then the second reaction is, ‘Well, let’s think outside the box.’ ”

Reflecting on the path ahead, Trapp said it was an exciting opportunity. “It’s a great challenge — and I love a challenge.”"

The EFA: 20 years of Tiger school - Airbus,"Wed, 13 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTEyLXRoZS1lZmEtMjAteWVhcnMtb2YtdGlnZXItc2Nob29s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Franco-German School (L’École Franco-Allemande, EFA) in Cannet des Maures, which trains Tiger crews from both nations, was created as part of an ambitious joint project backed by a strong commitment from Airbus Helicopters (Eurocopter at the time). And now, 20 years after it was founded, there is no doubt about its success in both human and operational terms.

“It was an honour for me to be the first Head of the EFA,” recalls Alain Salendre, who joined Airbus Helicopters after leaving the military in 2006. “Everything had to be built from scratch and our management put all their trust in us. We were able to do what we thought was best for both countries, and it was an intense experience for everyone involved.” Aside from the arrival of the first aircraft and simulators, which were highly advanced for their time, Alain Salendre insists: “The EFA is above all a human success story. It’s a project that has brought two cultures and two populations closer together. The school has been very well received by the local community and authorities, and our German partners have had no trouble integrating.” Driven by this Franco-German determination, military cooperation has also been a complete success. Discussions have been, and still are, ongoing and sincere, with a view to furthering integration.

Training excellence proven time and again

Twenty years on, the EFA has matured. The excellence of its training has been proven time and again on battlefields from Afghanistan to Africa, where the Tigers have consistently shown their technological superiority, firepower and tactical impact. So much so, that no operation conducted jointly with ground troops is conceivable today without a detachment of combat helicopters. The EFA currently has seven French HAD Tigers and as many German KHT Tigers. Its cruising speed enables it to train around 80 people each year: pilots, captains and patrol leaders, as well as Flight Crew Simulator Instructors (FSIs). For maintenance personnel, type training takes place at the Franco-German Centre for Technical Logistics Personnel in Fassberg (Germany). So, “in this unique place and environment, French instructors train French crews while their German counterparts do the same for their crews,” explains the school’s current Chef de Corps, Lieutenant Colonel Olivier Mallet. This makes a lot of sense, given that “the HAD and KHT mission equipment differs.

That said, the areas where pooling is applied on a day-to-day basis are extremely vast.” For example, since 2021, all ‘pilot’ synthetic flights have been taken in Franco-German patrols. The same applies to patrol leaders, for whom diversity and cooperation are demonstrated in the simulator, by bringing complementary HAD and KHT patrols together in the same tactical scenario. “For the past two years, we have been qualifying all our trainees to shoot at the Canjuers camp during bi-national shooting campaigns,” adds Lieutenant Colonel Mallet. To complete this picture of cooperation, witness the latest example of synergies put in place, namely the activation of computer-assisted courses given in English for trainees from both nations. If figures are anything to go by, the EFA Tiger has passed the symbolic milestone of one thousand people trained, and “day-to-day life is undeniably 100% Franco-German synergy,” concludes Lieutenant Colonel Mallet.

Industry has played its part

The Tiger programme has played an essential role not only in the creation of Eurocopter, but also in structuring cooperation between the German and French armed forces. “Over and above the contractual terms, we benefited from Eurocopter’s proactive and effective presence with us,” recalls Alain Salendre. “On-site technical assistance helped us a great deal during the ramp-up phase, and we had direct access to the Design Office whenever we had technical queries. Eurocopter was genuinely determined to make this cooperation a success.”

Around 100 Airbus employees fall ill after company Christmas party - CNN,"Sun, 24 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi8yNC9idXNpbmVzcy9haXJidXMtZW1wbG95ZWVzLXNpY2stY2hyaXN0bWFzLWx1bmNoL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAVFodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIzLzEyLzI0L2J1c2luZXNzL2FpcmJ1cy1lbXBsb3llZXMtc2ljay1jaHJpc3RtYXMtbHVuY2g?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

A holiday celebration for employees of an Airbus subsidiary in France took a turn for the worse earlier this month as dozens of employees became sick after a company Christmas party.

“Around 100 Airbus Atlantic employees were taken ill after contracting a food-borne illness after eating the company-organized Christmas lunch,” a spokesperson for the European aeronautics company said in an emailed statement to CNN.

The spokesperson did not specify the type of food.

Nobody at Airbus was rendered seriously ill by the December 15 incident, and all employees were back at work by the next Monday, according to the spokesperson.

Airbus Atlantic, established in January 2022, is a wholly owned Airbus subsidiary specializing in airplane seats. Airbus Atlantic has 13,000 employees in five countries, though the ill-fated Christmas lunch occurred in France.

French health authorities are leading an investigation into the illness outbreak, the Airbus spokesperson said.

“This appears to be an isolated event and all employees are recovering well,” the Airbus spokesperson added. “The health of our employees remains our primary concern and we are fully cooperating with the ARS health agency to identify the cause of the illness and ensure this cannot happen again in the future.”"

The EcoPulse recently completed its first flight test in hybrid-electric mode, marking a significant step toward the decarbonization of the aviation industry.

The aircraft departed France’s Tarbes Airport just after 10 a.m. on November 29 and flew for approximately 100 minutes, according to a statement shared by the aerospace giant on December 5. The EcoPulse has completed extensive ground tests and 10 hours of flight tests, but the electrical systems were always inactive. This recent jaunt is proof that the hybrid propulsion system works in flight.

“This is a major milestone for our industry, and we’re proud to have powered the EcoPulse demonstrator’s first flight with our new battery systems,” Airbus CTO Sabine Klauke said in a statement.

Unveiled at the Paris Air Show in 2019, the EcoPulse was developed by Airbus, Daher, and Safran to reduce carbon emissions and lower noise levels. Based on a Daher TBM aircraft, the newcomer is equipped with six electric thrusters (or e-Propellers) on the wings. Each one is driven by an electric Safran engine rated at 50 kW.

The pilots on the EcoPulse’s first hybrid-electric flight.

The propulsion system combines two power sources: a turbogenerator (an electric generator driven by a gas turbine) that was supplied by Safran and a 800 V battery pack that was supplied by Airbus and can deliver up to a 350 kW. In addition, a Power Distribution and Rectifier Unit (PDRU) protects the high-voltage network and distributes the available power.

The demonstrator is fitted with acoustic monitors that measure noise levels so that the team can make refinements to future designs if needed. Airbus has also developed an advanced flight control computer system that will allow pilots to carry out maneuvers using the ePropellers.

“High-energy density batteries will be necessary to reduce carbon emissions from aviation, whether for light aircraft, advanced air mobility, or large hybrid-electric aircraft,” adds Klauke. “Projects like EcoPulse are key to accelerating progress in electric and hybrid electric flight, and a cornerstone of our aim to decarbonize the aerospace industry as a whole.”

The team says lessons learned from upcoming flight tests will feed into their technology roadmap and help them to create more sustainable aircraft for the future."
"Collaboration is key with supply chain, says Airbus - Leeham News and Analysis","Tue, 12 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi8xMi9jb2xsYWJvcmF0aW9uLWlzLWtleS13aXRoLXN1cHBseS1jaGFpbi1zYXlzLWFpcmJ1cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Scott Hamilton

Dec. 12, 2023, © Leeham News: The aerospace supply chain still hasn’t fully recovered the COVID-19 pandemic. All aerospace manufacturers are affected, as are the supplier to the suppliers.

At the annual Aviation Forum last week in Hamburg, Germany, Airbus said collaboration is one of the keys to recovery.

Jürgen Westermeier, the chief procurement officer (CPO) at Airbus, said “unlocking the power of collaboration” means “great things happen when we work together.

“This has been illustrated in the past, when we had to face a situation of crisis together. In the past, in the face of a crisis, collaboration has been key,” Westermeier said.

There have been first-hand a series of successive crises which radically reshaped the aerospace sector. “Be it in an unprecedented global pandemic, geopolitical events, the likes the world hasn’t seen in a long time, and a climate emergency that no one can ignore anymore. Several suppliers entered the COVID period with weak financials.”

In addition, the CPO said, there has been high inflation, increasing energy prices, rising labor costs, and bank interests that are putting the ability of certain categories of suppliers at risk. “Airbus developed over the years several collaborative tools designed to better manage the crisis together. First, the Supplier Financial Watchtower,” Westermeier said. “This allows Airbus to monitor the financial health of its supply chain and identify potential issues. We are then able to deep dive into specific situations to understand the risk at stake, and if necessary, co-develop a mitigation plan with the supplier concerned. Not only does this approach ensure we can support our supplier in securing a planned ramp-up, but it also allows us to develop a sense of community.”

All in this together

“We are all on the same team,” Westermeier said. Airbus can also call upon another tool called the Joint Improvement Plan. This is a governance framework designed to mitigate the crisis and, in parallel, transform the ways of working together collaboratively with the supplier to avoid new crises arising in the future.

The CPO said that this methodology is key to building strong relationships with the suppliers and improve mutual trust for future collaboration. Another tool called CONBID enables Airbus to identify the needs of its supply chain for a specific material. “It is key to ensuring we can actively arbitrate the demand within our supply chain and redistribute when required.

“This is something we specially started last year when we realized there would be an issue with the availability of aerospace steel. So, in the present, as we adapt and above all prepare for the future together, collaboration is key. Collaboration is a key lever for increased productivity and enhanced efficiency.”

Boosting resilience

Westermeier said that as Airbus continues to face challenges, it is really critical that the OEM and supplier boost resilience together across the entire aerospace sector. “We have launched a number of collaborative initiatives really designed to increase the effectiveness through standardized approaches such as, and let me start with our initiative, ZERO-M (Zero Missing Parts). Traveled work from the production line to the ramp is the bane of any OEM’s existence. ZERO-M aims to reduce the impact of supply chain disruptions across all operational flows and with the final vision of reaching zero missing parts in the long run.

ZERO-M Together is designed to strengthen Airbus’ prevention system, reach higher levels of anticipation and standardize good practices across the industry, such as buffer management.

Another one, called AXcess, addresses how efficiency translates into competitiveness.

Reducing costs

Westermeier said that Airbus developed, tested and standardized a set of proven methodologies that aim at collaboratively taking costs out of the system.

“In light of the difficult economy context, it is quite clear that we all must presume every opportunity to reduce costs whilst ensuring the financial stability of our suppliers, our partners is maintained.

Boeing long ago implemented a supplier cost-cutting program called Partnering for Success. After seeing too many suppliers reporting profit margins larger than Boeing did, the company largely forced its suppliers to cut costs or they’d risk being dropped as a Boeing supplier. The program drew widespread angst, with some renaming the effort Partnering for Poverty or Preparing for Sacrifice.

In Boeing’s backyard in the greater Seattle area, some suppliers groused that they preferred working with Airbus. While Airbus also sought to cut costs, they said, at least the method wasn’t as adversarial.

Interestingly, on the sidelines of the Hamburg Aviation Forum, LNA heard similar complaints about Airbus being heavy handed and some preferred working with Boeing.

Airbus has other programs intended to boost collaboration.

For years, OEMs relied on just-in-time delivery of parts and components. With the supply chain still operating below peak efficiency, Airbus—and others—have added buffers to inventory. At Airbus, this buffer is about a four-month supply of parts.

Eco-Aviation

With a shift in emphasis toward eco-aviation, Airbus likewise is working with suppliers—collaborating, to use the buzz word—to make Airbus “greener.”

“We collaborate with our innovation ecosystem to imagine future concepts that will bring this vision to reality,” Westermeier said. For Airbus’ sustainability and innovation roadmaps, “perhaps our biggest challenge in preparing the future is the journey to become more sustainable.

“Sustainability is an industry-wide challenge, and we will only succeed through collaborative and aligned initiatives. It is a special time for the aviation industry, where we connect today and tomorrow. Today, we are part of creating an ecosystem for SAF, Sustainable Aviation Fuel, to decarbonize the current and the future fleet,” the CPO said.

SAF also addresses the current fleet. Airbus is also working on several research and technology projects that are aimed at making its aircraft more efficient and already preparing for the next generation of conventional aircraft he said.

Airbus Initiatives

“Airbus launched a number of collaborative initiatives, focusing in particular on data transparency and decarbonization. The Airbus Supplier Sustainability Council set up back in 2022, establishes a framework to collaboratively accelerate sustainability initiatives with the supply chain and fostering a new model of engagement with suppliers. These ambitious sustainability targets cannot be reached without a clear innovation roadmap.”

France Funds Research Into Conventional A320neo Successor - Aviation Week,"Wed, 20 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvYWlyY3JhZnQtcHJvcHVsc2lvbi9mcmFuY2UtZnVuZHMtcmVzZWFyY2gtY29udmVudGlvbmFsLWEzMjBuZW8tc3VjY2Vzc29y0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In June 2023, Airbus Group CEO Guillaume Faury opened a second avenue for Airbus. He told Aviation Week that work had begun on a more conventional successor for the A320-neo family, a project known internally as eAction. The aircraft is intended to complement Airbus’ ZEROe hydrogen project. Now eAction is gaining momentum, with the French government agreeing to a first round of research support.

France has committed €300 million ($330 million) to research and development support per year in 2024-27. By contrast, public support for startup companies working on electric or hydrogen propulsion is limited to a €65 million envelope.

The difference in resource allocation calls into question the realism of Airbus’ hydrogen project, which French ministries describe as involving an extended time frame. The principle of funding large, profit-making corporations such as Airbus and Safran may also create some unease. Some suppliers complain they too often see little, if any, of the money. Moreover, aerospace research center ONERA has proved its worth and yet receives comparatively modest government resources. In 2022, it was given a €111 million subsidy within a total budget of €277 million.

The funding at least shows how important Airbus is for the French government. The aerospace sector, largely driven by the Toulouse-based airframer, was the No. 1 contributor to the country’s trade balance in 2022.

Nevertheless, state support might raise new issues after a 2021 deal that settled a longstanding transatlantic trade dispute concerning Airbus’ and Boeing’s public funding. The accord created a framework for research and development funding. Both the U.S. and the EU agreed to support their respective manufacturers financially in a transparent way. Aircraft import tariffs were suspended for five years while a working group was tasked with finding a permanent solution.

“We need to find acceptable mechanisms to incentivize private sector investment and share risks with governments in order to support the design and development of new aircraft programs that will deliver the decarbonization of aerospace,” Faury told the Financial Times Dec. 3.

“We need a new generation of planes,” the Airbus CEO told Aviation Week in June. “We are preparing all the technologies for the plane, the production system, the digitalization of the plane and for using data to be able to fly the planes better. We have to be at 100% of [sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)] or close to 100% of SAF by 2050, not only technically but commercially as well. [This means having] planes that can fly economically under these conditions. We need aircraft that burn around 20-25% less fuel than what we are using today with the A320neo or the A321neo. That’s why we are preparing entry into service in the second half of next decade targeting 2035, maybe between 2035 and 2040.”

The decisions were made public after a Dec. 15 meeting of the French Civil Aviation Research Council (CORAC), which met to align the sector’s research and technology, an industry ministry staffer explained. “OEMs are setting the tone for future aircraft,” he said.

Research and technology are now clearly directed toward the A320’s successor. “Our priority is the ultraefficient aircraft,” a transport ministry staffer said. The annual €300 million will support “breakthrough technologies including engines,” she noted. The CFM International Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) open fan demonstrator on which Safran and GE are working may benefit, she added.

As for propulsion, Airbus is “working very closely with CFM to look at all the dimensions of flight or integration—of performance, of certification and so on—to decide whether [RISE] is a viable option or not,” she said.

“Our teams believe it is likely to be viable, but there are still a number of boxes that need to be ticked,” Faury said in June. “We will be flight-testing the open alternative and working a lot on simulation and computation with CFM to look at all the dimensions of what it has to deliver. But yes, we consider it to be a promising technology.”

The French government is also putting time pressure on Airbus: “Our objective is that the sector moves into production mode by 2030,” the transport ministry staffer said. “The technology readiness level should be high enough—the technology may not be entirely mature, but we should be confident a development can be completed. CORAC’s goal is to help maturation.”

Hydrogen needs more time, the transport ministry staffer said. “It is even more of a breakthrough—the [technology readiness level] is even lower and even more steps are required,” she noted. Airbus, however, has long referred to 2035 as the service-entry year for a zero-emission aircraft powered by hydrogen, using either gas turbines or fuel cells.

Devised for smaller companies, a second, €65 million call for projects is being launched. “It is dedicated to emerging projects and airframers, typically startup companies working on electric or hydrogen propulsion,” the industry ministry staffer said."
Airbus selects Kenya for the 1st HAPS drone hub – SatNews - news.satnews.com,"Fri, 08 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5zYXRuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzEyLzA4L2FpcmJ1cy1zZWxlY3RzLWtlbnlhLWZvci10aGUtMXN0LWhhcHMtZHJvbmUtaHViL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"AALTO HAPS Ltd. aims to deploy its Zephyr aircraft that can stay aloft for days at a time from four or five bases around the world, starting with the operational hub in Laikipia County in Kenya early next year, according to the company’s CEO.

However, this plan is subject to regulatory approvals from the Kenyan government. This development could bring about a significant boost to the local economy by potentially creating up to 1,000 job opportunities for Kenyan residents.

These high-altitude drones, operating in the stratosphere between 10 to 50 kilometers, have the capability to act as mobile signal masts and attract telecommunication companies as key users.

After thorough consideration, Airbus selected Kenya as the preferred hub for this groundbreaking initiative due to several favorable factors. The country offers the ideal combination of optimal weather conditions for launching and landing the aircraft, business-friendly practices, a substantial talent pool, and quick licensing processes.

Mr. Halawi, the company’s CEO, while emphasizing the significance of this milestone project, stated that Airbus plans to establish four to five hubs worldwide to serve the global market. Each hub will encompass various units, including launch and landing ports, maintenance facilities, assembly lines with a production capacity of up to 50 aircraft per year, an operations center, and customer support facilities.

A crucial aspect that makes Kenya stand out as a hub is its ability to launch and land these high-altitude drones for up to 10 months annually. Consequently, the country is slated to host the majority of launches and landings, further solidifying its position in the aerospace industry.

Furthermore, the Zephyr aircraft developed by Airbus over the past two decades brings a new dimension to the aerial landscape. With its unique ability to land and take off in a corkscrew motion and remain airborne for more than 30 days, the Zephyr HAPS has enormous potential. It weighs 75 kilograms, boasts a wingspan of 25 meters, and can serve multiple purposes such as security observation, border security, mob

As this groundbreaking initiative takes shape, Kenya stands to benefit from becoming a pioneering force in HAPS commercial and technical regulations, potentially paving the way for accelerated industrialization of the sector throughout the decade.

Airbus recognizes Kenya’s language capabilities and favorable time zone as advantages that would enable them to establish the program’s main customer care in the country.

With this next-generation technology and strategic collaboration, Kenya is on the brink of a new era in high-altitude communication drones, ushering in unparalleled opportunities for economic growth and technological advancement."
Airbus CEO says state support may be needed to develop new aircraft - Airport Technology,"Wed, 06 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcnBvcnQtdGVjaG5vbG9neS5jb20vbmV3cy9haXJidXMtc3RhdGUtc3VwcG9ydC1uZWVkZWQtbmV3LWFpcmNyYWZ0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is already looking at the development of new hydrogen aircraft. Credit: Airbus SAS

The CEO of European aircraft manufacturer Airbus has said that the company may need state support to develop its next single-aisle aircraft to replace the A320 family and its concept range of hydrogen-powered aircraft.

Guillaume Faury said that the company was committed to an existing finance model with governments supplying loans towards the building of new aircraft that were only repayable when the model reached specific order levels.

In an interview with the London Financial Times, Faury said: “We need to find acceptable mechanisms to incentivise private sector investment and share risks with governments in order to support the design and development of new aircraft programmes that will deliver the decarbonisation of aerospace.”

While the manufacturer, which is projecting an adjusted EBIT of €6bn ($6.47bn) for 2023, is already receiving some research funding from European governments towards exploring a replacement to its A320 narrow-body family, a new deal in the form hinted at by Faury could push the limits of an existing agreement between the EU and US.

That agreement ended an almost two-decade dispute over state support for Airbus and US-based Boeing with both sides of the Atlantic signing up to a deal promising not to give specific support to their local supplier that could harm the other transatlantic manufacturer.

However, despite Faury’s comments on the possibility of asking for funding to support its development of new aircraft, the company has already been researching the creation of a range of hydrogen-powered aircraft under the ZEROe range with an ambition of bringing the world’s first commercial hydrogen aircraft to market by 2035.

Turkish Airlines Orders Up To 345 Airbus Planes - Skift Travel News,"Fri, 15 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjMvMTIvMTUvdHVya2lzaC1haXJsaW5lcy1vcmRlcnMtdXAtdG8tMzQ1LWFpcmJ1cy1wbGFuZXMv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly9za2lmdC5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi8xNS90dXJraXNoLWFpcmxpbmVzLW9yZGVycy11cC10by0zNDUtYWlyYnVzLXBsYW5lcy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Turkish Airlines pulled the trigger on its long-anticipated aircraft order, opting for 220 Airbus planes. The order could reach as many as 345 planes if all purchase rights are ultimately exercised. It includes both widebody A350s for overseas routes, and narrowbody A32neos for shorter-haul journeys.

On two separate occasions earlier this year, Turkish announced orders for 14 A350-900s, planes that compete roughly in the same size category as Boeing’s 787-9. The new order includes an additional 50 A350-900s, with purchase rights for another 20.

In addition, Turkish will take 15 A350-1000s, which are larger than the -900s. It added five (or 10 with purchase rights) A350 freighters. The A321 order, meanwhile, involves 150 firm units, with purchase rights for another 100.

“The addition of these advanced Airbus aircraft to our fleet will not only enhance our operational capabilities but also significantly contribute to our environmental goals,” said Turkish Airlines chairman Ahmet Bolat.

Turkish Airlines’ Fleet

In a November company presentation to investors, Turkish said it currently operates 435 planes, which include Boeing 737s, 777s, and 787s, and Airbus A320/321s, A330s, and A350s. That’s up from about 350 total aircraft before the pandemic, and a mere 98 on the eve of the 2008-09 global financial crisis. Some of the newly-ordered Airbus planes will be for growth, others for replacing older aircraft as they’re retired.

Boeing was hoping to land more orders from Turkish. According to Cirium Fleets Analyzer, the airline has 31 737 Maxes and 11 787s still to be delivered. Sun Express, a Turkish-Lufthansa joint venture airline, has another 32 Maxes on order. Turkish has not, to Boeing’s disappointment, ordered any 777Xs thus far. The 777X is the largest plane Boeing currently sells.

This year through November, Turkish noted in a recent release, passenger traffic was up 17% from the year prior. Some of that growth reflects the reopening of markets that were closed during the pandemic, notably in Asia.

But it also highlights the airline’s remarkable expansion during the past two decades, underpinned by Istanbul’s favorable geography, Turkey’s large tourist sector, and the airline’s unit cost advantages versus European rivals. It’s also growing a low-cost carrier that it owns, recently rebranded as AJet. And it operates a fast-growing cargo airline.

Ten years from now, Turkish aims to have a fleet of more than 800 planes, servicing more than 100 million passengers a year."

When it debuted, it overtook the long-reigning Boeing 747 as the world's biggest passenger plane. It has four engines and is a full double-decker that can carry more than 800 people depending on an airline's cabin layout.



The plane's large number of seats was seen as key in helping to reduce the overcrowding of air traffic at several big airports, such as London's Heathrow Airport, New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.

But orders for four-engine aircraft began to decline alongside the arrival of more fuel-friendly planes such as Airbus' own A350 and Boeing's 787 Dreamliner.



""What we've generally heard from airlines is that when you can fill an A380, the unit costs, as in the cost per seat, are very attractive,"" said Mike Stengel of AeroDynamic Advisory. ""But of course, you know, consistently filling 550 seats is far more difficult than consistently filling a 350-seat wide-body.""



The Europe-based Airbus announced an end to its A380 superjumbo program just 12 years after it first took to the skies.



During the Covid-19 pandemic, the A380 was one of the fleets most heavily affected by the near-halt to international long-haul travel, due to its size and operating cost. Many said it was the end for the superjumbos, but the A380 has been making a comeback, with several airlines pulling planes out of retirement.

Airbus says it expects the A380 to be flying for the next two decades, and it is still being operated by 10 airlines, including Emirates, Lufthansa, Etihad Airways and British Airways.

The German Bundeswehr has placed an order for up to 82 Airbus Helicopters H145Ms, representing the largest ever order for the military version of the type.

The contract is for 62 firm orders plus 20 options, and also includes seven years of support and services, spare parts, eight simulators, and training for pilots and maintenance personnel.

The aircraft will be used in a light attack helicopter role as part of a bridge solution to replace the German Army’s fleet of Tigers.

The German Army will receive 57 of the new aircraft, with the remainder going to the Luftwaffe’s special forces.

The order was placed following approval of the procurement from the Budget Committee of the German Bundestag on Dec. 13, and will be financed from a €100 billion “special fund” the country has set aside for the modernization of its military.

“We are proud that the Bundeswehr has decided to order up to 82 H145M helicopters,” said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters, in a press release announcing the news. “The German Air Force has gained a significant amount of operational experience with its H145M LUH Special Operations Forces fleet.”

Even referenced the “very ambitious delivery schedule” that calls for first deliveries in 2024, with the last aircraft set to be received in 2028,

The multi-role H145M is designed to meet a broad range of mission capabilities, with the ability to be quickly reconfigured from a light attack role (with axial ballistic and guided weapons and self protection systems), into a special operations version that includes fast rappelling equipment.

Airbus said the new German H145M includes options for future mission capabilities, including the ability to operate with the integration of manned-unmanned teaming and upgraded data links and communication systems.

The basic version of the aircraft will be equipped with fixed provisions, including Airbus’s HForce weapon management system. Airbus said this will allow the Bundeswehr to train its pilots on the same type of aircraft that is used for operation and combat.

The aircraft will be based at the International Helicopter Training Center in Bückeburg, at Army bases in Niederstetten, Fritzlar and Faßberg, and with the Air Force in Laupheim.

The Bundeswehr already operates 16 H145M LUH special operations and eight H145 LUH search-and-rescue helicopters. The U.S. Army employs almost 500 helicopters from the H145 family — the UH-72 Lakota. Other operators of the H145M include Hungary, Serbia, Thailand and Luxembourg. Cyprus has ordered six aircraft."

When it comes to passenger jets, the same thing is true — but the quantities involved are even more disparate.



Consider the Airbus A330-800neo. Last year, Air Greenland acquired a few; still, sightings of it are so rare that this article opted to describe it as “elusive” in its headline. That isn’t a word one often hears when it comes to commercial jets from one of the world’s largest manufacturers of them. And yet that mode of scarcity continued throughout this year. According to a recent Business Insider article, Airbus sold all of one A330-800neo this year.



As Business Insider‘s Taylor Rains reports, a similar aircraft, the A330-900neo has been selling very well. And Airbus’s business has been good overall. Earlier this year, the company’s CEO Guillaume Faury stated that there has been “strong demand for our products, particularly for commercial aircraft.”



In their financial reports for the first quarter of 2023, Airbus reported “net orders of 142 aircraft after cancellations,” to put the single order for an A330-800neo into context.

As for why the A330-800neo hasn’t sold as well as some of Airbus’s other offerings, Rains notes that it has a lower capacity but a longer range than its A330-900 counterpart — a tradeoff many airlines haven’t found compelling. Still, one is more than zero, though as per Business Insider‘s reporting, the buyer remains a mystery."

A Review of United Airlines’ New Airbus A321neo Airplane - AFAR Media,"Tue, 05 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmYXIuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lL2EtcmV2aWV3LW9mLXVuaXRlZC1haXJsaW5lcy1uZXctYWlyYnVzLWEzMjFuZW8tYWlycGxhbmXSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5hZmFyLmNvbS9tYWdhemluZS9hLXJldmlldy1vZi11bml0ZWQtYWlybGluZXMtbmV3LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIxbmVvLWFpcnBsYW5lP19hbXA9dHJ1ZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A whiff of new plane smell may be part of your next United Airlines onboard welcome. That’s because the Chicago-based carrier is undergoing a massive fleet renewal strategy as part of its “United Next” plan with 800 new aircraft being added between 2023 and the end of 2032.

Last week, United pulled the wraps off of its first Airbus A321neo, a single-aisle, narrow-body plane with a swanky interior and, a first for United economy passengers, a self-service snack bar. In addition to the grab-and-go pantry, on the new Airbus planes, travelers will find a variety of fun new amenities, including wireless charging stations and nifty technology enhancements throughout the cabin.

At least 180 of these jets will be delivered in the coming years, and along with the Boeing 737MAX, will serve as the backbone of United’s domestic fleet. Initially, these planes will mainly fly out of United’s Chicago O’Hare hub heading to and from Fort Lauderdale, Las Vegas, Orlando, and Phoenix.

I was onboard one of the first passenger flights, a 1,400-mile journey from Chicago to Phoenix. Here’s a full rundown of what future fliers can expect.

New grab-and-go snack station

United is the latest carrier to offer a grab-and-go snack station for economy fliers. An airline spokesperson said a “limited supply of water and snacks” will be available from the aft snack bar, with the current offering including That’s It Fruit Bars, Undercover Chocolate Quinoa Crisps, and a savory snack mix. The amenity is an attempt by United to “uplevel the customer experience for every customer, in every cabin,” according to the airline.

The bar won’t replace any onboard service element, but instead, it’ll be open to passengers on flights of 801 miles or more on a first-come, first-served basis following the cabin crew’s first snack and drink pass-through.

While an economy grab-and-go station is unique to United’s A321neo, it’s not the first time travelers have had access to a snack bar on a plane. In fact, since 2019, first-class passengers on United’s 50-seat regional jet, the Bombardier CRJ-550, could help themselves to a robust array of snacks and soft drinks near the front aircraft door.

Historically, with a pantry-like setup since 2014 for long- and medium-haul flights, JetBlue has been the self-service leader. In addition to a variety of drinks and juices, JetBlue’s current pantry snack selection includes Chifles Plantain Chips, Popchips, Quaker Chewy Chocolate Chip Granola Bars, and Stellar Vegan Butter Pretzel Braids. (It’s a richer selection than what United offers at the moment.)

Bigger overhead bins

When it comes to storing bags, larger overhead bins mean enough space for everyone’s carry-on. By stacking bags horizontally (instead of laying them flat), there’s room for 200 large roller bags on the new United planes. That means, theoretically, the need to gate check should be a thing of the past.

Mood lighting

As for the rest of the experience, LED mood lighting (in varying shades of blue) and a mosaic-like ceiling pattern create a sleek, upgraded feel from the moment passengers board the aircraft. It’s what United is calling the “signature cabin,” one that will be unified across the entire fleet in the future.

Wireless tech and accessibility features throughout

Travelers can say goodbye to wired headphones; each 12-inch or 14-inch Panasonic seatback screen on the A321neo comes with Bluetooth connectivity. Those screens also include a dynamic secondary display in the lower-right corner showing information such as the amount of time left in flight.

Besides standard power outlets, a super-fast USB-C charging port is at each seat. And if that’s not enough to juice up devices, first-class passengers even get wireless charging pads built into the armrests.

Earlier this year, United became the first airline to add Braille to its aircraft. The A321neo has these markings on overhead compartments as well as inside and outside the lavatories.

While United has onboard snacks and perks aplenty, the total seat count—200 from nose to tail—is more than what Delta Air Lines and American Airlines have on their respective A321neos. United’s version includes 20 first-class recliners, 57 extra-legroom Economy Plus seats, and 123 economy seats. It might be a tighter squeeze than competitors but the airline makes up for it with splashy new features and technology enhancements galore.

From easier device charging to an onboard snack bar and a super-responsive seatback screen, United has created a more premium environment, which is a big part of the airline’s broader ambitions."
Turkish Airlines orders 220 aircraft with Airbus - Airport Technology,"Mon, 18 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcnBvcnQtdGVjaG5vbG9neS5jb20vbmV3cy90dXJraXNoLWFpcmxpbmVzLW9yZGVycy0yMjAtYWlyY3JhZnQtYWlyYnVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Turkish Airlines ordered aircraft from four different models. Credit: Airbus

Turkish Airlines, one of the biggest in the Middle East, has placed an order for 220 aircraft from Airbus as it looks to modernise its fleet.

The significant purchase, described as a “landmark order” by the airline, is a major expansion on the airline’s two previous Airbus orders this year and is split across the manufacturer’s A321 and A350 families, with 150 and 70 respectively.

Dr Ahmet Bolat, chairman of the board and executive committee for Turkish, said: “The addition of these advanced Airbus aircraft to our fleet will not only enhance our operational capabilities but also significantly contribute to our environmental goals. This investment is a crucial milestone in the further evolution of Türkiye’s aviation industry.

“By modernising our fleet with more efficient and environmentally friendly aircraft, we are reinforcing our leading position in global aviation and contributing to the nation’s prominence as an aviation hub.”

Alongside the 150 A321neo aircraft, Turkish’s order will include 50 A350-900s, 14 A350-100s and 5 A350F freighters, taking the airline’s orderbook with Airbus to 504, though 212 have already been delivered.

The addition of new freighter craft is in line with the news from earlier this year that Turkish Airline’s cargo branch, Turkish Cargo, had become the third biggest cargo carrier in the world according to IATA data, with 5.4% of the market share in May.

According to Airbus, the A350 family delivers a 25% “advantage in fuel burn, operating costs and CO2 emissions” and a 50% noise reduction, while the A321neo offers the same benefits on noise and a 20% fuel saving and reduction in CO2 emissions."
Air China Cargo welcomes first Airbus A330 converted freighter - Yahoo Finance,"Mon, 18 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9haXItY2hpbmEtY2FyZ28td2VsY29tZXMtZmlyc3QtMTUxNjAyMDk5Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A freshly converted A330-200 cargo jet sits outside the Air China Cargo terminal in Shanghai. (Photo: EFW)

The cargo subsidiary of Air China has received the first of eight used Airbus passenger aircraft that are being retrofitted to transport shipping containers on the main deck.

Elbe Flugzeugwerke, an Airbus joint venture company that specializes in aftermarket engineering projects, announced Friday that licensed contractor Aircraft Maintenance and Engineering Corp. (Ameco) converted and delivered an Airbus A330-200 to Air China Cargo.

It is the first time that Air Cargo China will operate the A330-200. The national flag carrier currently has three Boeing 747-400 and nine Boeing 777 freighters. Air China Cargo is expected to dispose of four Boeing 757-200s that have not been in service for several months. It operates two domestic routes and 14 international ones, with its main base in Shanghai. Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific has a 24% ownership stake in the cargo airline.

EFW publicly disclosed for the first time that Air China Cargo early this year signed a contract for the passenger-to-freighter conversion of eight A330-200s. Air China, which revealed its intentions in a securities filing last April, is discontinuing use of the widebody aircraft in its passenger fleet and transferring them to its cargo division. A second aircraft is already undergoing conversion in the production hangar, EFW said. The rest of the planes are expected to be delivered in 2024 and 2025.

Ameco is the largest provider of maintenance and overhaul services for aircraft in China. It signed a partnership agreement in November 2022 to install EFW-designed conversion kits at its facility in Chengdu.

The A330-200 converted freighter has a gross payload of 61 tons at a maximum range of 4,200 nautical miles. It is more suited for heavier, general cargo while the -300 is the preferred choice for lighter e-commerce shipments because of its extra volume.

EFW has set up new conversion sites in China, Turkey and the U.S. to meet rising demand for cargo reconfigurations. Conversion facilities were swamped with orders for the past three years, but airline and lessor interest has slowed to a trickle this year because of the prolonged downturn in air cargo shipping.

Story continues

Sichuan Airlines last summer became the first Chinese airline to operate an A330 converted freighter after it was converted in Shanghai by another airframe modification specialist on EFW’s behalf.

Turkish Airlines chief executive Bilal Eksi said in a social media statement that the entire order could potentially add up to 355 aircraft.

The deal would be one of the industry's largest and substantially expand the Turkish flag carrier's existing fleet of 439 jets.

""I wish good luck to our country and our company,"" Eksi said.

Turkish Airlines said in a separate corporate filing that the purchases would be made as part of its ""strategic plan"" for 2023-2033.

But the airline and Airbus differed slightly about the details of the deal.

The Turkish Airlines statement said it had made firm orders for 230 jets and placed purchasing rights for an additional 125 aircraft.

Airbus said the 230 figure included 10 jets Turkish Airlines had ordered in September and thus covered only 220 new aircraft.

The airline's confirmed order purchase -- which includes 150 A321 NEO and 60 widebody A350-900 jets -- has a catalogue price of more than $40 billion.

Few deals cost their actual sticker price because plane makers make discounts for bulk orders.

Cheers in Britain

The Turkish carrier's existing fleet is split evenly between Airbus and Boeing aircraft.

The new order delivers a massive boost to the European aerospace giant in its race for global supremacy with its US rival.

""This order for the latest generation aircraft is a demonstration of the bold vision by Turkish Airlines,"" Airbus executive Christian Scherer said in a statement.

""We are proud to accompany Turkey's connection to the world with our state-of-the-art aircraft.""

Turkish Airlines is based in Istanbul's newly-built international airport and flies to 120 countries.

The company claims to own ""the title of the airline that flies to most countries in the world"".

Turkish Airlines said the deal also includes a separate order for Rolls-Royce to provide maintenance services and spare parts for the A350 jets' engines.

The British government said Friday's deal includes 70 aircraft powered by Rolls-Royce.

""This landmark deal between Turkish Airlines, Airbus and Rolls-Royce demonstrates that the sky's the limit for the UK's thriving aerospace sector,"" British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement.

British trade secretary Kemi Badenoch called it a ""bid win for the UK's world-leading space sector"".

- The purchase of 40 Boeing 737-8 MAX and 60 purchasing options

- Purchasing options for 40 additional aircraft of the A320 family



The Supervisory Board has approved the acquisition today.



Dr. Detlef Kayser, Member of the Executive Board, Fleet and Technology: ""With today's aircraft order, we are accelerating the largest fleet modernization in our company's history. This increases our order list of around 200 aircraft to 280 – plus an additional 120 purchasing options for further state-of-the-art short- and medium-haul aircraft.

In addition to this, the decision for the Boeing 737-8 MAX will also give us more flexibility for the procurement of short- and medium-haul aircraft in the future. The new ultra-modern aircraft offer our guests additional comfort. They are also quieter, more economical, more efficient, and emit up to 30 percent less CO2 than their predecessor models. The order demonstrates our airlines' future viability and ability to invest, and it shows that we are living up to our responsibility to reduce our carbon emissions.""



Airbus A220-300



This latest-generation aircraft has 148 seats and consumes around 2.5 liters of fuel per 100 passenger kilometers. The A220 is intended for use by the newly founded airline Lufthansa City Airlines and will be deployed on short-haul routes from Frankfurt and Munich. With its ultra-modern geared turbofan engines from Pratt & Whitney, the A220-300 is ideal for use in feeder traffic. The first aircraft is scheduled for delivery in 2026.



Boeing 737-8 MAX



The Boeing 737-8 MAX is the further development and 4th generation of the world's most widespread commercial aircraft. The aircraft will have 190 seats in Business and Economy Class and, thanks to its efficient engines from CFM International, will only consume around 2.2 liters per 100 passenger-kilometers. The first aircraft is expected in the third quarter of 2027. As the planned growth path for both Lufthansa Airlines, including Lufthansa City Airlines, and SWISS is already underpinned by aircraft orders, the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft will be deployed in one of the Lufthansa Group's other flight operations. The decision on this will be made at a later date.



Airbus A320 family



In addition to the firm orders, Lufthansa Group has secured a further 40 purchase options for aircraft from the A320 family. Around 450 aircraft of this model series are currently in service with Lufthansa Group airlines, making it well-established in the short- and medium-haul segment. 71 A320neo and A321neo aircraft that have already been ordered will be delivered in the next few years. With the agreed 40 purchase options, Lufthansa Group is now securing favorable conditions for future orders as part of the Airbus offer.



New aircraft biggest lever for CO2 reduction



With a current fleet of more than 700 commercial aircraft, the Lufthansa Group is pursuing a long-term fleet strategy focused on cost efficiency and reducing emissions. Compared to their predecessor models, the new additions to the Lufthansa Group fleet have up to 30 percent lower fuel consumption and correspondingly lower carbon emissions. The Lufthansa Group aims to halve its net carbon emissions by 2030 compared to 2019 in order to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

Around USD 9 billion at list price



The aircraft orders agreed today, worth around USD 9 billion at list prices, are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group's capital expenditure in 2023 and 2024, the period covered by the current medium-term plan. Net investments of between EUR 2.5 billion and EUR 3 billion are expected in 2023. Capital expenditure in 2024 is expected to be at a similar level."

When Airbus published its nine-month update to September 2023, Airbus Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Guillaume Faury, sounded relatively optimistic that the company would reach its target of “around” 720 deliveries by the end of 2023.

With November 2023 results now in, Airbus currently stands on 623 deliveries and therefore needs another 97 aircraft to reach customers in the final month of the year.

“We’ve delivered 71 planes in October. So, what we have to deliver for November and December this year is similar to what we did a year ago. So, it is indeed a big quarter, but we see we have part of that quarter already behind us with our performance in October. We think we are well placed for November and visibility for December. That’s why we feel like we are in a good place to confirm the guidance of around 720 planes in 2023,” Faury told Bloomberg on November 8, 2023.

According to Reuters, on average in the past three years Airbus has delivered 93 planes in December.

Airbus also confirmed that it added 113 gross orders to its books, including a repeat order for 30 more A220 aircraft from airBaltic at the Dubai Airshow 2023.

Another order at the Dubai Airshow came from Emirates as the airline purchased an additional 15 Airbus A350-900 widebodies.

Airbus also received an order for 60 A320neo family aircraft from leasing firm SMBC Aviation Capital on November 21, 2023.

On December 6, 2023, Boeing announced that it had delivered 351 of its popular 737 family of twinjets so far in 2023.

This total is just 25 airframes short of its revised annual target of 375-400 units targeted for the year.

History Of The Airbus A380: The Largest Passenger Aircraft - SlashGear,"Mon, 25 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZ2Vhci5jb20vMTQ3NTIyMC9haXJidXMtYTM4MC1sYXJnZXN0LXBhc3Nlbmdlci1haXJjcmFmdC1oaXN0b3J5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"History Of The Airbus A380: The Largest Passenger Aircraft

If you have taken a relatively recent flight inside the U.S., chances are pretty strong it was either on board a Boeing 737 or an Airbus A320, the two best-selling commercial airplanes in the world. Beyond that, you may have stepped aboard a Boeing 747, 757, or 777, or maybe an Airbus A330. If you've taken an international flight, the likelihood of you being on one of those planes is pretty good. Then, of course, there are all the smaller planes for short-haul flights, which are the ones you probably felt the most uncomfortable riding en route to your destination.

For many of these planes, you may not be able to tell much of a difference in their design. There may be some extra seats, and it may be set up in a 3-4-3 configuration for each row, but that's about as big as you're likely to see in a commercial airliner. However, one commercial airplane dwarfs the competition: the Airbus A380. This double-decker behemoth can carry 555 passengers across three classes and is only used by a handful of airlines across the world, most notably Emirates.

However, in early 2019, Airbus announced that the largest commercial airliner in the world would be ceasing production by the end of 2021. And in December of that year, it did indeed deliver its last plane to Emirates. So, what made the Airbus A380 so impressive, and what led it to stop being made just 14 years after first being delivered?"
Airbus finally got an order for its worst-selling plane: A330-800neo - Business Insider,"Sun, 03 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLW9yZGVyLWZvci13b3JzdC1zZWxsaW5nLXBsYW5lLWEzMzAtODAwbmVvLTIwMjMtMTLSAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1vcmRlci1mb3Itd29yc3Qtc2VsbGluZy1wbGFuZS1hMzMwLTgwMG5lby0yMDIzLTEyP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus secured a single order for its worst-selling A330-800neo widebody airliner this year.

The plane is a shrunk version of the A330-900neo and has secured 12 orders since its debut in 2014.

Airlines have opted for aircraft with better per-seat costs, such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

While Airbus has had no trouble selling its next-generation A330-900neo, the widebody jetliner's little brother is struggling to keep up.

In April, a single order for the A330-800neo was quietly added to Airbus' order book from an undisclosed customer. The company confirmed the purchase to Business Insider but said it was ""the privilege of the customer to disclose the order.""

This brings the total orders for the A330-800neo to just 12 from five customers, according to Airbus: two from Uganda Airways, four each from Kuwait Airways and Garuda Indonesia, and one each from Air Greenland and the mysterious new buyer.

The A330-800neo is a smaller version of the A330-900neo, which has secured hundreds of global orders since the family's 2014 launch. The A330-800, however, is a rarity in the airline industry despite being in development for just as long.

The pair were launched as a replacement to the company's already successful fleet of A330-200 and A330-300 widebody planes, as well as a solution to Boeing's ever-popular 787 Dreamliner.

Both the A330-800 and A330-900 are exclusively powered by the more fuel-efficient Rolls Royce Trent 7000 engines, which Airbus says reduces fuel emissions by ""25% compared to its previous-generation aircraft.""

But this burn is not enough to offset the low capacity and per-seat cost of the A330-800 compared with its larger counterpart.

The problem is that the shrunk A330-800 was designed with range as its selling point — it can fly about 1,000 miles further than the A330-900's nearly 8,300-mile range.

But because the A330-800 has fewer seats, the operating costs end up higher than what airlines are willing to pay.

""All shrinks are a bit heavier on a per-seat basis because they're carrying around the same structures and systems and engines as the bigger planes but with fewer seats,"" Richard Aboulafia, a managing director at the consultancy firm AeroDynamic, told Business Insider in December 2021.

This is especially important when the A330-900 already offers enough range to meet airlines' needs, making it a better option cost-wise. Plus, the extra capacity could be used for money-making business- and first-class seats.

In 2014, Leeham News and Analysis reported that Airbus argued the A330-800's $260 million price tag made up for the added operating costs.

But the order books — such as United Airlines' deal for up to 200 Boeing 787s in December 2022 — prove there are several other aircraft options that better compete with the middle-of-the-market A330-800neo.

And most airlines are looking at more economical options.

For example, Hawaiian Airlines dropped its order for the A330-800 in 2018 in favor of the Boeing 787-9, which is set to enter its fleet in 2024.

Hawaiian Airlines CEO Peter Ingram told Business Insider in 2018 that the dwindling demand for the jet was a red flag. He said the airline had to consider that ""if something affects the economics [of the business] and we need to make a change,"" it could be stuck with a jet that nobody else wanted.

Planespotters data shows just seven of Airbus' poor-selling jetliners have been put into service so far, with Garuda Indonesia still yet to receive one. Airbus' test A330-800 is parked, and the last of its type to be delivered was to Air Greenland in December 2022.

The few carriers that fly the A330-800 have sung its praises

In an interview with Aviation Source News in December 2022, Air Greenland CEO Jacob Nitter Sørensen said the airline initially chose the A330-800 over the 787 because its performance, efficiency, and economics fit into its Greenland-centered business model.

""We love the [A330-800], and so do passengers, and the efficiency improvements are even better than those promised by Airbus,"" he said in a recent November interview with Aviation Week.

After its first A330-800 delivery, Uganda Airlines said the aircraft's ""operational efficiencies, range, and payload characteristics"" made it an ideal aircraft for the airline's network.

Still, its faults have not gone completely unnoticed.

In a March interview with Aviation Week, Kuwait Airways CEO Maen Razouqi said the A330-800 — which at the time was launched nonstop to New York-JFK — would offer ""better margins"" than the Boeing 777 it was flying on the route.

He further explained that Kuwait Airways did not plan to convert its existing A330-800 orders to the A330-900 so long as Airbus did not delay deliveries, but admitted the larger variant would ""offer a better economic footprint.""

The Boeing 777 has since re-taken over Kuwait's route to New York-JFK from the A330-800, and later plans to launch the jet to Dulles International Airport in Washington, DC, on December 15 have been scrapped, according to Cirium data."

"Spain orders Airbus maritime patrol, surveillance aircraft for $2B - Defense News","Thu, 21 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS8yMDIzLzEyLzIxL3NwYWluLW9yZGVycy1haXJidXMtbWFyaXRpbWUtcGF0cm9sLXN1cnZlaWxsYW5jZS1haXJjcmFmdC1mb3ItMmIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Spain has ordered 16 Airbus C295 aircraft in maritime patrol and surveillance configurations for €1.7 billion (U.S. $1.9 billion), Airbus announced Wednesday.

Six maritime patrol variants will come equipped for anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare missions, replacing the Spanish P-3 Orion fleet that retired at the end of 2022, Airbus said. Equipment for each of these aircraft includes a magnetic anomaly detector and sonobuoys for submarine detection; a multimode radar for long-range target detection; and satellite communications technology.

These aircraft will also carry weapons, including torpedoes, and will be “highly connected” so they can operate as flying command-and-control centers, according to the French company.

The remaining 10 C295 aircraft in the maritime surveillance configuration are to replace Spain’s aging CN-235 fleet, which entered operations in 1988, according to the Air Force.

Airbus will equip the new planes for anti-smuggling, anti-illegal migration and anti-drug trafficking operations, as well as search and rescue missions, the firm said.

Spain already operates a fleet of 13 C295 aircraft in a transport configuration, and the two maritime versions will have a high degree of synergy, the manufacturer said.

Assembly will take place at the Airbus military facilities in Seville, Spain. The country expects to receive the first C295 in the maritime patrol configuration in 2027; the first surveillance configuration the year after; and delivery of the final aircraft in 2031. CASA, a predecessor company of Airbus, designed and first manufactured the C295.

The contract includes training systems, such as a full flight simulator, as well an initial logistics support package, Airbus said. The government approved the budget to buy the C295 aircraft in June and signed off on the contract in September.

The C295 has been an export success for Airbus in Spain, with total orders for 283 planes at the end of November, of which 216 were delivered so far. The company in September handed over the first of 56 C295 aircraft ordered by the Indian Air Force.

The aircraft is powered by two Pratt & Whitney turboprops and has a maximum takeoff weight of 23 metric tons. The armed maritime patrol version can operate for two and a half hours at a distance of 800 nautical miles from takeoff, and six and a half hours at a distance of 400 nautical miles, according to Airbus.

Cathay Pacific places order for 6 Airbus A350 freighters - Yahoo Finance,"Fri, 08 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9jYXRoYXktcGFjaWZpYy1wbGFjZXMtb3JkZXItNi0wODIyNDI2NjguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A350 freighter, as seen in this computer-generated image, offers comparable cargo capacity as the Boeing 777 and 777-8. (Image: Airbus)

Cathay Pacific Airways announced Friday it has placed an order for six Airbus A350 freighter aircraft, providing the aerospace manufacturer a boost after a quiet year for purchases of cargo jets and getting the better of Boeing.

Airbus will begin deliveries of the large, long-haul freighter to Cathay Cargo in 2027. Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific has options for 20 additional aircraft. The deal is worth $2.7 billion at list price, but airlines usually negotiate discounts with manufacturers.

Cathay Pacific’s freighter fleet is still relatively young and executives have previously said additional aircraft would be for growth to meet future demand.

“These highly fuel-efficient, next-generation freighters will provide important additional cargo capacity, expand our global network and contribute to our sustainability leadership goals,” said Cathay Group CEO Ronald Lam.

Cathay Cargo has 20 Boeing 747 freighters, including 14 747-8s and six older 747-400s. It also manages cargo carried in the lower decks of Cathay’s passenger aircraft. It is the 13th largest cargo airline in the world by transported volume, and the 11th largest traditional freighter operator when express carriers FedEx and UPS are excluded, according to the International Air Transport Association. It fell eight spots in the rankings during the past year because of extended COVID travel restrictions in Hong Kong and China that only fully lifted at the end of 2022.

Cathay is already one of the largest operators of the A350, with a current fleet of 47 aircraft. The freighters will provide maintenance and training commonality with the passenger aircraft.

Cathay Pacific also operates a large number of Boeing 777 passenger jets in addition to the 747 freighters. And it has ordered 21 Boeing new-era 777-9 widebody passenger aircraft. But the airline passed over Boeing’s 777-8 freighter, the redesigned replacement for the current 777 freighter that must still be certified by U.S. regulators. Boeing plans to begin deliveries of the 777-8 freighter in 2027.

Story continues

Airbus earlier this year said it expects to deliver the first A350 freighter, currently under development, in 2026. The Cathay Cargo order brings Airbus’ total orderbook for the new widebody jet to 41. Other customers include Qatar Airways, CMA CGM Air Cargo, Etihad Airways, Silkway West Airlines and Singapore Airlines. The last order prior to Cathay Cargo’s was by Air France/KLM in January.

Airlines and leasing companies have shied away from freighter investments this year because of prolonged weakness in the air cargo market, which has led to a sharp decline in cargo revenues.

The A350F is designed to carry a payload of up to 122 tons and fly up to 4,700 nautical miles at significantly lower cost than existing cargo jets. Powered by Rolls-Royce Trent-XWB97 engines, the A350 is estimated to achieve a 40% reduction in fuel consumption and carbon emissions compared to the 747. Airbus claims it is 20% more efficient than Boeing’s new 777-8 freighter.

Over 70% of the airframe is made of advanced materials, resulting in a 50-ton lighter take-off weight than the Boeing competitor, according to Airbus.

Announced on December 19, 2023, Lufthansa said the orders are respectively for 40 Boeing 737 MAX 8s, with the option for 60 more in the future and 40 Airbus A220-300s for Lufthansa City Airlines, with the potential for an additional 20 more. The agreement with Airbus also included an option to order 40 aircraft from the Airbus A320 family.

“The Lufthansa Group was one of the first customers for the A220 and has successfully operated the aircraft in its SWISS route network ever since. We are delighted by this testimony of confidence from our long-standing partner and customer,” Christian Scherer, Chief Commercial Officer and Head of Airbus International, said. “As the only clean sheet design aircraft and specifically designed for the 100-150 seat market the A220 is the most efficient solution in its category to support Lufthansa Group meeting its exciting airline development and sustainability objectives.”

The cumulated firm deals are confirmed as costing $9 billion with deliveries of the aircraft expected from 2026 to 2032.

Lufthansa said that through the order it is “accelerating the largest fleet modernization” in the airline’s history.

“We are pleased that both Airbus and Boeing were able to convince us on all commercial and technological aspects,” said Detlef Kayser, Member of Lufthansa’s Executive Board, responsible for commercial and technical fleet management. “In addition to this, the decision for the Boeing 737-8 MAX will also give us more flexibility for the procurement of short- and medium-haul aircraft in the future. The new ultra-modern aircraft offer our guests additional comfort.”

The 40 Boeing 737 MAX 8s and 40 Airbus A220-300s bring Lufthansa Group firm orders from around 200 to 280 aircraft.

“Our relationship with the Lufthansa Group has led to a number of industry changing achievements and we are delighted to see the 737 return to an original launch customer’s fleet,” Stan Deal, President and CEO, Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said. “The Lufthansa Group has set bold targets to decarbonize its operations. The 737-8 will help the Lufthansa Group meet those sustainability targets with significant improvements in fuel use, emissions, and community noise impacts, all while reducing costs for the airline.”

The Lufthansa Group’s current Boeing order backlog includes firm orders for 34 787 Dreamliners, seven 777-8 Freighters and 20 777-9 planes."
