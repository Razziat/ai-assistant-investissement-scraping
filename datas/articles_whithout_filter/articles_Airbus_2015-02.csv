Introduction

Feb. 26, 2015: As part of the invitation to cover Airbus group press conference in Munich on Feb. 27 where the annual results are presented, Airbus offered the journalists joining from South of France to fly there in one of the A350 test aircraft, the cabin test specimen MSN002. They did not have to ask twice, Figure 1.

The flight was done as a combined transportation of media from Toulouse and Paris to Munich and test flight for the cabin area. It was also the first time A350 landed on Charles De Gaulle (CDG) and Munich airports, which added to the excitement. The aircraft still carried full test equipment and there were measurement probes on windows and different parts of the cabin.

The crew was the normal test crew reinforced with Airbus cabin personnel who cared for the attending journalists. The advantage of this was there was plenty of time to talk to the test engineers and pilots both in flight and while waiting for joining media at CDG. Here the story of the development workday for test people where the actual aircraft has just entered service with the first customer. But first how it was to fly:

Flying A350 as passenger

We had the chance to fly A350 both in business and economy class and to check out cockpit + crew facilities. Business class is equipped with 42 Sogerma Solstys lie flat seats, staked in an effective four abreast configuration at 41-45 inch pitch dependent on cabin position. Economy had 210 B/E Aerospace Pinnacle seats with 18 inch seat width and 31-33 inch pitch. This makes for 252 seats, but there is at least three triplets taken in the rear cabin for the flight test engineers station, Figure 2, so it is not a representative seat density for the aircraft.

The overall impression is that of space both in business and economy class. It is not so much the space in the seats (even though there is ample space there). This is very much dictated by chosen seats from Airbus A350 catalog and how these are placed by the operator. It is more the general feeling of space in the aircraft cabin as such. The flown A350-900 is only 5%-7% larger in passenger capacity than A330/340 in the 300 versions but has the feel in the cabin of a considerably larger aircraft.

It has to do with the space above the seat rows, the roof sits higher and the overhead bins are less intrusive as on the A330/340 generation. I have not flown the Boeing 787 Dreamliner so refrain from any such comparison. The space in the seat in Business class was ample but that is a seat and configuration decision for the airlines. Space in economy is more a combination of airline standards (chosen seat and pitch) and aircraft capability (seat width). Once again the feeling was of adequate space seat wise (I am 1m85 or 6foot 2inch) and a roomy cabin ambiance.

Sound level was low but not exceptionally so. I sat just at the front of the engines when in business in a window seat and then mid wing position in economy, once again window seat. At the later there was some wing turbulence rumble noise. The cabin ambiance was more like sitting in a nine abreast 777 than a larger replacement for A330/340.

When flying 777 I have a problem with cabin draft in several seat positions, not so in A350. I know I am ultra sensitive to this and others might not notice it, but the A350 seemed well done in terms of air circulation concept and air speeds (Boeing has the chance to surprise for 777X). All cabin sections in A350 have a cabin altitude of 6000ft as standard as has Boeing’s Dreamliner and as will the 777X. The premium cabins have higher cabin humidity as option. This raises the cruise humidity from around 5% to around 17%. As a consequence, extra de-humidifiers are required to take care of generated condensations in the fuselage insulation and other areas. Economy cabin does not have the extra humidity option.

Flying the A350 as cabin crew

While we have no competence to evaluate the working environment for A350’s cabin crew, we could do a detailed check of some important features: the cabin crew rest and the facilities for offering child families and wheel-chaired persons access to adapted lavatories.

The cabin crew rest is placed in the crown of the aft cabin with entry from the aft galley, Figure 3.

In this aircraft was the larger variant with eight bunks, three in front, two to the side and three aft of the entry area. We tried the aft ones and they were plenty large, over two meters in lengths and spacious. Sound level during flight was quite low for such an area. We were in the space with one of the cabin test engineers and feedback from cabin crews had been good but there were still detail things to improve (see below).

We could also check out a multiple use middle double lav.

Figure 4 show left lav with child care shelf lowered and Figure 5 show the same lavatory forming the second part of a PRM (Passenger with Reduced Mobility) lavatory, the wall between the two lavs has been folded away.

Flying the A350 as flight crew

At the stop in Paris I had the chance to talk with the pilots and to check out their work space. A350 is a good work environment for the pilots. We are going to focus on the ambiance in the flight crew work area for this article; piloting the aircraft will be for a later article.

The cockpit is roomy with two pilots seats, a third seat in the middle and a fourth clap seat to the left of the cockpit door. Directly outside the cockpit door is the entry to the overhead pilots rest. It has bunks for two pilots and a resting chair facing forward. Opposite of the rest area entrance is a lavatory and the whole area can be balked off with a privacy door. On long flights an integrated cockpit area can therefore be created including rest area, lavatory and cockpit as on space, ideal for keeping a flight crew fresh on the 15 hours flights A350 is designed for.

Flight testing

We spoke at length to the flight test engineers, Jaime Angoloti and Jens von Essen, both responsible for the cabin tests on MSN002. They had been working MSN002 since Februray 2014 and said that different to the A380 (which one of them also had done), they received a functioning cabin that mainly had problems in the software interface areas like between IFE suppliers and the aircraft’s functions like safety and in flight announcements. Equipment could jam another resulting in freezes and everything had to be reset. This is all controlled in software where equipment computers all talk to each other on the aircraft’s Ethernet network.

The interfaces were not mature and robust enough initially and required improvements. The cabin is presently on software release 4.2.2 and Qatar Airways as first customer has a software release which is three major versions higher than the initial release for MSN002. So things work satisfactorily now but as each airline demands modifications and adaptations, such work will not stop for quite some time.

Other than this there has mainly been detailed functional improvement requests and tests of different ideas how to lower weight or improve space utilization. There have been articles in the press about major changes to the cabin area for A350 to gain weight. We could find no evidence of such sweeping changes. Rather the work is as described by the engineers; right now the temperatures in an aft compartment around the cargo area where measured to see if the temperature kept above freezing when the insulation was reduced with 20kg. If results are positive this will go into the pipeline of continuous improvement suggestions and be decided in due course if it will form part of a future build standard. A similar test has been conducted for the cockpit area.

Other examples of improvements requested by testing airline crews were a better sleeping angle of the aft bunks in the cabin crew rest. The aircraft flies with the fuselage at 2.8° nose up and therefore the floor of the crew rest has an angle. For forward facing bunks this is OK but not for the rear which face backwards. Mattresses of these bunks are angled 3° to give a level feeling but in practical test crews has said it is not enough (I climbed in there to check, one feels like lying head down).

Now there are new measurements done of the actual angle (Figure 4) and then the mattresses will get a larger angle. Also the safety placard lights and IFE remotes are to strongly lit for a sleeping crew member, shall be dimmed further. This might seem trivial but is gives a good idea of the issues at hand and the kind of tests that remains to be done for A350.

Summary

Overall the feeling is of an aircraft that came together well. Work right now is to hone it from good (for where it is in its useful life) to really good. This will take continued efforts by test crews and there is also the up and coming -1000 to take through its paces. After that there is a bit of quandary as to what all the thousands of cabin experts at Airbus shall do.

There are no major cabin changes foreseen for A320neo and A330neo, the only hope is that any A380neo project requires cabin changes.

On the Wings of Giants: Airbus Banks on the Beluga - NYCAviation - NYCAviation,"Tue, 03 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55Y2F2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDE1LzAyL3dpbmdzLWdpYW50cy1haXJidXMtYmFua3MtYmVsdWdhLzM4MDgx0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Throughout Airbus’ first two decades in business, its competitors at Boeing would joke that “Every Airbus is delivered on the wings of a Boeing.” That statement was both accurate and fair, being that Airbus had to use modified Boeing Stratocruisers known as Super Guppies. Yes, Airbus was transporting parts for its own jets inside 1940s-era planes built by its only real competitor.

As time progressed, Airbus finally resolved the issue by designing its own transport based on one of their own planes – the A300 twin-engine jet. The resulting A300-600ST (ST for Super Transporter) became commonly known as “The Beluga” for its bubble-like forehead resembling the Beluga whale. To accomplish the plane that seems to defy every law of aerodynamics, Airbus employed some major structural changes. Starting at the nose, Airbus lowered the cockpit below the cargo deck so that the cargo area could be loaded without having to disconnect any of the vital electric and hydraulic lines running to the rest of the plane. The design kept the A300’s lower fuselage, wings and landing gears, but added a cavernous cargo area on top.

At 49,440 cubic feet, the Beluga’s cargo volume ranks second between Boeing’s 747-LCF Dreamlifter (65,000 cubic feet) and the Antonov An-225 (45,909 cubic feet). The Beluga is hampered by its weight lifting capability, which is only 47 tons (103,617 pounds) or roughly the weight of an empty 737. Its cargo bay measures 25 feet in diameter. The Beluga has a maximum takeoff weight of just over 341,000 pounds, while the Dreamlifter tops out at 803,000 pounds. In comparison, the 747-8 freighter is capable of lifting over one million pounds, and the An-225 can lift over 1.4 million pounds. The Beluga is also incapable of hauling sections of the A380 due to its size. Those parts are still taken by barge or road convoy to the A380’s final assembly location in Toulouse.

Powered by twin General Electric CF6-80C2 engines, the A300 version of the Beluga only has a range of 900 nautical miles, just under the distance from Houston (IAH) to Chicago (ORD). This engine is also seen on the 747-400, 767, MD-11, and C-5M Super Galaxy. CNN reported in November that the Beluga fleet flies about 5,000 hours per year, but Airbus expects that number to double by 2017 under an internal initiative called “Fly 10,000.” With Airbus taking a record number of orders and achieving a record backlog, the next generation Beluga fleet is expected to be able to fly up to 120 flights per week, with a longer range and heavier payload capability.

The first Beluga rolled out of final assembly in Toulouse in 1994 — twenty years after the first A300 was introduced — and took its first flight in September of that year. The current five-plane fleet was under construction from 1992-1999. Each plane cost an estimated $285 million. Now that the planes are marking 20 years in service with 40-year-old technology, Airbus announced last November that it is planning to build a fleet of five new Belugas on the A330-200 platform. These are expected to enter service in mid-2019. Airbus says these planes will support the ramp-up of A350 XWB construction and other production increases. Until all five A330 Belugas are in the fleet, Airbus will fly both types of aircraft through 2025.

Allegiant Air is again expanding its fleet, announcing on Monday that it has reached a deal to buy six used Airbus A319s from Manila-based Cebu Pacific Air. Delivery is expected to begin late this year and run through 2017.

The deal comes as the Las Vegas-based leisure carrier has been increasing its fleet of Airbus jets amid a broad expansion in the U.S. The company announced last summer that it would purchase 14 Airbus aircraft, most of which are the smaller A319.

The airline said it anticipates operating a fleet of 44 A320-family aircraft -- including Monday's announcement for the A319s -- by the end of 2018. Allegiant left the door open for adding more down the road.

""We continue to be able to find high quality, used A319s that fit our specification...and will remain active in the used A320 [family] market,"" Jude Bricker, Allegiant's SVP of Planning, said in a Monday statement. Allegiant will configure the jets to seat 156.

The airline is likely to use the newly added jets to expand its network, particularly since it has not announced plans to reduce the 53 MD-80s in its fleet. Allegiant's fleet also includes six Boeing 757s."

But instead of stopping to assess the damage, the airliner — with 134 passengers and 11 crew onboard — continued with its take-off procedure, the AP reported.

The jet, a widebody Airbus A330, clipped the tail of a neighboring Bangkok Airways plane with the tip of its wing.

According to the AP, the pilots of the Korean Airbus didn't notice the collision, and none of the aircraft's collision warnings sounded to alert the crew.

It was, however, reported that ground staff at the airport witnessed the incident and immediately notified the the control tower of the damage.

The jet, Flight 472, returned to the Myanmar capital shortly after taking off for the five hour flight to Seoul, after the officials determined a collision had occurred.

No injuries were reported and the delayed passengers boarded another flight for the South Korean capital later in the day."
US Army Awards Airbus $220.5M Lakota Order - Defense News,"Mon, 16 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9sYW5kLzIwMTUvMDIvMTYvdXMtYXJteS1hd2FyZHMtYWlyYnVzLTIyMC01bS1sYWtvdGEtb3JkZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — The US unit of Europe's Airbus Group was awarded a contract modification worth $220.5 million to build 41 more UH-72A Lakota light utility helicopters for the US Army, planned as flight trainers at Fort Rucker, Alabama.

A service budget official said at a roundtable with reporters earlier this month that next year marks the last of the Lakota fleet for the active Army. The president's budget request for fiscal 2016, released Feb, 3, included $187 million for 28 more helicopters. The budget request indicates no additional funding for 2017 and beyond.

As part of the Army's aviation restructure, the plan is to divest from the TH-67 Creek training helicopters, made by Bell Helicopter, and replace them with the Lakota. The Lakota is replacing the Army's OH-58 Kiowa Warrior A and C models, made by Bell.

The president's budget request includes $5.7 million to support an increase in flying hours associated with increased student loads at the Army National Guard aviation training sites and the fielding of the Lakota to replace the Kiowa.

The contract announced Feb. 12 runs through July 31, 2017, and also covers the associated Airborne Radio Communications 231 radio communications system, according to Airbus spokesman Jamie Darcy.

The contract brings the total number of Lakota helicopters ordered to 411 — 400 for the Army or National Guard, five for the US Naval Test Pilot School and six that will go to Thailand through the foreign military sales program. Airbus had delivered 331 of the aircraft as of Friday, Darcy said.

The 41 aircraft are all to be built at the Airbus facility in Columbus, Mississippi. The Army had used the Lakota, a militarized version of the commercial EC145, for non-combat purposes: homeland security, drug interdiction, general support, logistics and medical evacuation.

"Airbus faces A400M charges, no immediate currency windfall - Yahoo Finance","Tue, 24 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHA6Ly9maW5hbmNlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1mYWNlcy1hNDAwbS1jaGFyZ2VzLW5vLTAwMzM0NDg4MS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus Group (AIR.PA) may take up to 500 million euros in charges for the latest delays to its A400M military transport plane when it reports 2014 earnings on Friday, analysts said.

At the same time, it is unlikely to reap immediate benefits from a sharp drop in the value of the euro, despite being one of Europe's largest exporters. Its hedging policies leave little room for manoeuvre until 2018.

The European aerospace group shook up the management and organization of the A400M military transport program last month after the latest in a long series of delays and technical woes.

While Airbus has promised to give a financial update on the project with its annual earnings, it is likely to take longer to establish a definite new timetable for deliveries.

Analysts polled by Reuters in partnership with Inquiry Financial forecast A400M charges of between 200 million and 500 million euros in the fourth quarter, on top of 4.2 billion euros already taken over the life of the defence project, Europe's largest.

Airbus' operating earnings before one-offs will rise 1.4 percent to 1.272 billion euros, according to the survey of 16 analysts. On average they see one-off items of 274 million euros, including A400M and others.

Despite some market predictions that Airbus Group would be in the front line to benefit from a recent 10 cent drop in the euro to $1.13 since late December, people familiar with the aerospace group warn this will not be felt straightaway.

Airbus appears fully hedged at above $1.30 for 2015 and there is little leeway in the hedging book through 2017.

""The dollar effect starts to kick in during 2017 but it could be felt strongly in 2018,"" said a person close to the company. Airbus Group declined comment ahead of its results.

Deutsche Bank said Airbus Group may have been more active in hedging than previously expected in the fourth quarter, locking in rates before the slump in the single currency.

The focus will also be on any updates on output targets. Airbus is discussing a possible increase in A320 production to 50 jets a month as early as 2017, a senior industry source said.

At the same time it is reviewing A330 output, which is widely expected to be cut soon, because of slow sales.

Airbus Helicopters selects X4 engine - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 18 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1c2hlbGljb3B0ZXJzc2VsZWN0c3g0ZW5naW5lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In 2012, Airbus Helicopters launched the X4 initial design concept around two highly capable turboshaft engines options: Pratt & Whitney Canada’s PW210E and Turbomeca’s ARRANO.

At the conclusion of this preliminary phase, and founded upon a comprehensive market assessment, Airbus Helicopters has decided to amend the product positioning, consequently necessitating a significant engine power increase.

Multiple scenarios have been studied with both engine manufacturers. Airbus Helicopters and Pratt & Whitney Canada have decided not to pursue a growth version of the PW210E engine for the X4 Program. Nevertheless, Pratt & Whitney Canada will continue to provide support until completion of the initial phase.

Airbus Helicopters values Pratt & Whitney Canada as a strong partner on the existing EC135 and EC175 platforms and is collaborating with P&WC on new opportunities including the PW210.

The X4 program will therefore enter into the full-scale development with a new uprated Turbomeca ARRANO engine. The X4 is Airbus Helicopters’s new generation medium twin-engine helicopter. Incorporating innovative technologies, the X4 will be tailored for a wide range of applications, including oil and gas operations, emergency medical services, public services, business and private aviation.

X4 will be presented to the public for the first time at HAI on March 3, 2015."

Introduction

01 Feb 2015: Six years ago Tom Enders, then-CEO for Airbus (when the parent was named EADS), threatened to stop the A400M project. He then played hardball to get eight European states to understand they had to pay 5bn Euro more or get no plane. Airbus existence could be threatened by a project that its management when the program was launch (CEO Jean Pierson) did not want but that the politicians convinced Pierson's successor, Noel Forgeard, to do.

Now Tom Enders is CEO of Airbus Group and has to apologize to the same governments that he struck a deal with then to finish the project if Airbus got the money and a consent to three years of delays. Now Airbus can no longer fulfill the terms and the airplane is still falling short of performance specifications. Deliveries have been delayed further and promised capabilities will be delivered later than said. Like then, heads are rolling at Airbus and tighter control is being applied.

Airbus Helicopters has signed Indian market launch orders for its single-engine EC130 T2 with Sanjay Ghodawat Group and Global Vectra Helicorp Ltd. (GVHL), which are to introduce the popular single-engine EC130’s enhanced version later this year for passenger transport services in Kolhapur and Delhi respectively.

Signing ceremonies with both customers – who ordered one EC130 T2 each – were held on Airbus Helicopters’ exhibit stand (OD-8) during Aero India 2015 at Bengaluru’s Air Force Station Yelahanka.

“We are delighted that our Indian customers have selected the EC130 T2 – which has the largest cabin of any single-engine rotorcraft in the world,” said Mr. Xavier Hay, managing director of Airbus Helicopters’ Customer Center in India. “We are confident the EC130 T2 will provide superior service in this country, especially with its advanced technology and the capability to deliver excellent performance in high and hot conditions.”

The Sanjay Ghodawat Group is a diversified conglomerate with presence in consumer products, energy, mining, chemicals and agribusiness, among others. GVHL is India’s largest private helicopter company, which will assign the EC130 T2 to Birdie – its on-shore operations division offering charters and religious tourism services among others.

“We are the first to start shuttle services in India, and are confident of providing the best services with the EC130 T2 – which offers a true economical solution, combined with the highest levels of safety,” said Mr. Ed Van Dam, chief executive officer at GVHL.

“The EC130T2 is suited to a broad range of travel solutions and features the latest technology and safety features,” added Mr. Sanjay Ghodawat, chairman of Sanjay Ghodawat Group. “We are proud to be a launch customer for the EC130 T2 in India.”

Airbus Helicopters’ multi-role EC130 T2 has a spacious cabin for one pilot and up to seven passengers. In addition to its improved performance, a number of enhancements enable easier maintenance and longer inspection intervals.

More than 70 percent of the EC130 T2’s airframe structure has been modified from the previous EC130 B4 version. New and updated features include the use of a more powerful Arriel 2D turboshaft engine and upgraded main gearbox; along with the incorporation of an active vibration control system, and improved air conditioning, distribution and demisting systems.

The EC130 T2 also has a redesigned cabin interior with a full flat floor, a cockpit update for enhanced man-machine interface, integration of a crashworthy fuel tank, and increased maintenance accessibility for the electrical and air conditioning systems.

Performance of the EC130 T2 has been improved for a higher maximum gross takeoff weight (2,500 kg. for internal loads, and 3,050 kg. when external loads are carried), and a speed increase of up to 10 kts. from the EC130 B4. Even with these enhancements, the EC130 T2’s external sound level remains within the strict rules for flights at America’s Grand Canyon National Park – an important factor for tour operators around the world."

A further addition to the Royal Thai Army’s rotorcraft fleet has been committed with the acquisition of six Airbus Helicopters light-utility EC145 T2, which is the newest and most powerful model in Airbus Helicopters’ proven EC145 light twin-engine helicopter family.

The Royal Thai Army signed for six EC145 T2s with a VIP installation, under the Light Utility Helicopter Type II requirement, to be deployed principally on official passenger transport duties, with deliveries scheduled to begin in 2016.

“By acquiring the EC145 T2, the Royal Thai Army again demonstrates its confidence in Airbus Helicopters’ products and services, following the successful entry into service of the AS550 C3e Armed Reconnaissance Helicopters in 2014 and the imminent delivery of the UH-72A Lakota Light Utility Helicopters from the United States,” said Philippe Monteux, Airbus Helicopters’ head of region South East Asia & Pacific.

The EC145 T2 features a modern digital cockpit and a four-axis autopilot. With a maximum take-off weight of 3.65 tons, the helicopter is powered by Turbomeca Arriel 2E powerplants equipped with dual-channel full authority digital engine controls (FADEC). Operational safety is enhanced by Airbus Helicopters’ Fenestron shrouded tail rotor, particularly for landings and takeoffs in confined landing sites, as well as during loading/unloading on the ground while the rotor is turning.

The UH-72A is a version of the EC145 type produced by Airbus Helicopters’ plant in Columbus, Mississippi for the United States Army and Navy. Six units were acquired by the Royal Thai Army in December 2013 from the United States Army under the Foreign Military Sales program."
Odds and Ends: Turkish tests A380; Boeing's cash out; A400M milestone before Airbus Group results - Leeham News and Analysis,"Wed, 18 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL2xlZWhhbW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMTUvMDIvMTgvb2Rkcy1hbmQtZW5kcy10dXJraXNoLXRlc3RzLWEzODAtYm9laW5ncy1jYXNoLWtlZXAtZmxvd2luZy1hNDAwbS1taWxlc3RvbmUtYmVmb3JlLWFpcmJ1cy1ncm91cC1yZXN1bHRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"18 Feb 2015: Turkish Airlines is contemplating testing A380 operations according to Blomberg by wet leasing two A380 from Malaysian Airlines. Turkish did the same when they tested the Boeing 777 before ordering it, then by wet leasing 777 from Jet Airways.

The deal would be good for both Turkish Airlines which could test the A380 to see if there is sufficient demand on their densest routes and for Malaysian Airlines as recent disasters has meant they no longer need the capacity of their six A380.

Probable destinations for Turkish would be London Heathrow and JFK. The two aircraft would be operated by Malaysian Airlines pilots and Malaysian would also furnish half the cabin crew during the first six months, the other half coming from Turkish. After the initial period there would be a dry lease phase where Turkish would continue with own crews. A third backup aircraft should be part of the deal.

Boeings CEO, Jim McNerney, has told investors at a Barclay’s investor conference that Boeing can use of to 80% of its free cash flow to pay back to investors without endangering planned R&D projects reports Reuters. Partly this comes from being able to keep the 777 production rates at around the current 100 aircraft per year in the bridge to the 777X. To entice airlines to continue buying the present 777, Boeing is working on improvements to the aircraft that will increase the efficiency by 2 %, half of which will be coming from improved GE90 engines and half from airframe changes.

McNerney further said the higher than expected deferred 787 productions costs were due to investments in production methods and the labor costs not coming down as expected. He also commented on the work on a new aircraft for the market between the present 737 and 787, “the 757 market” where he said the only thing which is clear is that the airlines want a slightly larger aircraft and we don’t see the market needing a solution in the near to mid term.

Airbus Groups results will be announced in a press conference from Munich Friday next week and their Military aircraft division is working on the outstanding improvements they owe A440M customers. Timely before the press conference they have now demonstrated the A400M working as a combined logistical transporter and tanker. In a series of rendezvous over four flights they transferred a total of 27 tonnes of fuel to two Spanish Air Force F18.

From the press release: “With a basic fuel capacity of 50.8 tonnes which can be increased by the use of extra cargo hold tanks, the A400M is the most capable tactical tanker in the market. The standard A400M aircraft has full provisions for air-to-air refuelling (AAR) operations already installed and only requires the rapid installation of the optional air-to-air refuelling kit to become a tanker.”

Our article shows that this is but one of the capabilities that should have been in delivered aircraft by now, Airbus is expected to announce further provisions for A400M development at the event.

ANALYSIS: Dauphin's demise spurs X4 development at Airbus Helicopters - Flightglobal,"Tue, 24 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYW5hbHlzaXMtZGF1cGhpbnMtZGVtaXNlLXNwdXJzLXg0LWRldmVsb3BtZW50LWF0LWFpcmJ1cy1oZWxpY29wdGVycy8xMTU5MjIuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On 3 March, in Orlando, Airbus Helicopters will finally reveal the future of its medium-class rotorcraft. Work on the new model – known so far only by its experimental designation of X4 – has been under way since at least 2010, but there is still little clarity as to what the helicopter looks like or what specifications it will boast.

There is no doubt that the X4 is badly needed, however. It is destined to replace the AS365 and EC155 Dauphin family of medium twin-engined helicopters, which have been selling modestly recently.

Flightglobal’s Ascend Fleets database records deliveries of both types as having slumped over the past 10 years. It is an issue partly of age – the original AS365 made its first flight some 40 years ago, and the EC155 dates from 1999 – and partly of intense competition.

Ascend data shows how quickly sales of the rival AgustaWestland AW139 have outstripped those of the Airbus Helicopters models. It may not be a direct competitor – the AW139 is bigger and heavier, boasting a maximum take-off weight of 6.4-6.8t against 4.5t for the AS365 and 4.9t for the EC155 – but has nonetheless taken market share away from Airbus Helicopters. Last year, for example, the AS365 and EC155 racked up just 28 orders, including 11 for Indonesia’s navy; although better than the 17 sold in the year before that it is some way short of the AW139’s 2014 sales total of 69, according to Ascend.

Analysts are quick to identify where the two Airbus Helicopters types are falling short.

The X4 is designed to replace Airbus Helicopters' modestly-selling AS365 Dauphin rotorcraft

Airbus Helicopters

“The AS365 and EC155 are old designs compared with a lot of the players in the market,” says Ben Chapman, aviation analyst at Ascend’s consultancy arm. “Faced with newer and more capable technology, the demand simply isn’t there from its major markets. [The Dauphin] still has a niche, but aircraft such as the AW139 have taken significant demand away. They are going to need a new design if they intend to continue competing in the segment,” he says.

The airframer is, of course, well aware of the need to replace these models and rejuvenate its moribund sales in the weight class. In interviews, Guillaume Faury, Airbus Helicopters’ chief executive, has frequently alluded to the fact that it is being out-competed by its Anglo-Italian rival. At an Airbus Group investor briefing in 2013, for example, Faury was forced to admit that the company was not capitalising on growth in the civil market for medium-weight helicopters and had “significantly lost ground” against its rivals.

“The Dauphin and EC155 are not competing appropriately – against the AgustaWestland AW139 mainly, but not only,” he said.

That message has been repeated several times over the past 12 months, reinforcing the impression that the airframer has lost ground in a segment it previously dominated, if not lost its way.

It follows that Airbus Helicopters views the successful introduction of the X4 as vital to its ambitions in the medium-weight class. Speaking late last year at another investor briefing, Faury said the new model would help complete its line-up in the segment. Development of the X4, alongside the first delivery of the new EC175 in December 2014, will mean that the airframer will “reinvest completely the segment of medium and light heavies with brand new products”, he said.

It is perhaps this urgency, coupled with the more no-nonsense style that Faury has introduced since he succeeded predecessor Lutz Bertling in May 2013, that has kept the shape of the X4 shrouded in mystery.

Early proposals for the X4 that circulated in 2012 proposed a highly ambitious helicopter featuring an all-new Thales cockpit, advanced rotor blade technology and Sagem-designed fly-by-wire controls.

In fact, at that stage the then Eurocopter was planning to launch two helicopters: initial models featuring more traditional avionics and a later variant, intended to be introduced around five years later, featuring synthetic vision and any number of other high-tech advances. Images of the aircraft showed a dramatically-sculpted fuselage featuring canard-like stabilisers at the front of the helicopter, an enclosed Fenestron tail rotor and a horizontal stabiliser swept out from the top of the vertical fin.

The scope of the programme has since been dramatically reined in. Around six months into Faury’s tenure signs of a more cautious approach began to emerge. At the manufacturer’s annual briefing in January 2014 Faury indicated that the development was still a priority, but suggested that a less complex product was envisaged. By the middle of last year, the scale of change had become apparent.

Gone was the phased approach to introducing an advanced cockpit. In fact, gone was pretty much the entire advanced cockpit. Fly-by-wire controls, explained Faury, would add too much time and complexity – and presumably cost – to a programme that was required to deliver in the relatively short term. Those advances, he argued, would not offer the end-user sufficient benefits to justify the hefty potential downsides.

“Why delay the X4 to wait for fly-by-wire?” Faury said. “Customers are expecting a competitive helicopter – that we can provide with the existing autopilot. We don’t need fly-by-wire. It increases complexity, non-recurring development costs and risks, and the value added for the customers – that’s not very clear.”

And as for planning two clear iterations of the helicopter from the very beginning, Faury was equally dismissive. “We will make one product that is good enough from day one.”

Initial concept sketches were striking

Airbus Helicopters

Not all the advances have been jettisoned, however. The X4 still appears, at least at this stage, to be very much a next-generation helicopter. The majority of the fuselage will be carbon fibre, and sections of early prototypes were fabricated at the company’s composite engineering centre of excellence at Donauwörth in Germany during the summer.

Rotor blades are also composite, featuring the distinctive “hockey stick” shape of Airbus Helicopters’ Blue Edge design. Testing of blade manufacturing techniques has been conducted at the airframer’s La Courneuve facility on the outskirts of Paris.

Flight testing of some dynamic components has been carried out on an EC155 flying testbed, and additional technologies have been taken from the manufacturer’s X3 high-speed compound helicopter technology demonstrator. Avionics will be the new Helionix suite that Airbus Helicopters first introduced on the EC175 and EC145 T2 last summer.

One piece of the jigsaw that seemed to remain in place, however, was the engines. Ever since 2012 the choice came down to a straight fight between Pratt & Whitney Canada’s PW210E and the new Arrano turboshaft being developed by France’s Turbomeca – both listed as units in the 1,100shp (820kW) range.

However, on 18 February the airframer announced that it was ditching the P&WC engine, with only the 1,100-1,300shp Arrano remaining.

Airbus Helicopters says that following a “comprehensive market assessment” it will move the positioning of the X4, “consequently necessitating a significant engine power increase” that would not be available without additional work on the PW210E.

However, the maiden sortie of the X4 may still be with the P&WC engine, given the development timeline of the Arrano.

Patrick Moncoutié, Arrano programme vice-president at the French engine manufacturer, says that it has given a commitment to Airbus Helicopters to accelerate the pace of the new powerplant by around six months. Certification of the engine is likely to be achieved by the end of 2017, ahead of service entry of the X4 in 2018.

Overall, Ascend’s Chapman believes the apparent change of direction to be a positive one. “It’s less about having new technology on board; it’s about bringing to market a new helicopter that’s more efficient and more reliable with longer range and better payload-range capability, with the right-size cabin.”

Work is clearly at a relatively advanced stage on the X4. In his December 2014 address to investors Faury noted that the first prototype had just undergone “power on”. First flight is rumoured to be early this year.

It may seem a relatively short timeline, but given the work that has already been undertaken, the airframer should be in a strong position to deliver on schedule.

That said, it cannot afford any slippages. Further entrenchment of the AW139’s position can only serve to highlight Airbus Helicopters’ lost dominance in the sector. In addition, with the AW169 – billed by some as a “Dauphin killer” – waiting in the wings, time may be running out for the airframer’s former cash cow.

The End Of The Airbus A380..... - God Save The Points,"Sun, 08 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvZHNhdmV0aGVwb2ludHMuY29tL2VuZG9mdGhlYTM4MC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Did you know that there is a 50% off sale on Airbus A380’s? Sadly, even with the markdown, they haven’t sold one to a passenger airline in over a year and there is no sign of that changing anytime soon. Smaller, smarter and more fuel efficient with accessibility to more destinations, that’s the way things are going. There is a little known fact in the airline industry: planes are relatively inexpensive to buy, but maintenance contracts to keep them in flight are tremendously expensive. Four engines mean more fuel, more potential problems and thus more need for maintenance. I know what you are thinking; Luftansa, Qatar, Emirates, Singapore, Korean, Air France, Asiana, Thai and Qantas all have one; so why would the Airbus A380 disappear? Running an airline is expensive. Flying the largest jumbo passenger jet in the world, half empty, is really expensive. If you enjoy the Airbus A380 for its sheer size or its state of the art cabin, make an extra effort to fly it because it won’t last forever. In case you were banking on getting a ride from Prince Al Waleed Bil Talal of Saudi Arabia on his “palace in the sky”, he’s cancelled his order too.

In time, the A380 will follow the likes of its predecessor Boeing 747, the first jumbo jet, which is now being phased out of virtually every airline fleet across the globe. Boeing has for the most part now ceased production of the 747 and Airbus did not receive an A380 order in 2014 and has yet to in 2015. Airlines love full planes and they want more people flying on them, from more cities worldwide. When planes are near capacity, airlines charge more for the remaining seats; and on smaller, more fuel efficient jets, their profit margin rises as fuel costs drop. The list of operators flying the Airbus A380 is an impressive “who’s who” in luxury airlines, but there is a fundamental flaw: not one of them is a North American carrier.

Everyone thought that the aircraft would pick up an order from a North American airline and become wildly popular, but it never happened, nor with a South American or African carrier for that matter. The truth is, most airlines only serve their longest haul destinations once or twice a day at best. They simply don’t have need for many aircraft of such magnitude, and have opted for smaller planes and more of them. The 380′ was designed to allow airlines to condense multiple flights into one, saving them a take off and landing slot, but the market has predominantly not responded. In the end, numbers have shown that on the most potentially effective A380 routes, like those of the US to Japan or China, that virtually no one has adopted the plane. Asian and North American carriers have instead opted for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, or the soon to hit the skies Airbus A350, the Dreamliner’s direct competitor. Many airlines believe that the key for expansion is presence in emerging travel markets. The accessibility of having a smaller aircraft using less fuel means more runways in more cities to which they can fly.

Don’t get me wrong, you will still see the A380 gracing our skies for a long time to come. There are presently only 138 of them in the world and once previous orders are filled, I simply don’t think there will be many more. For comparison sake, the 787 Dreamliner is newer and has already delivered 235 planes in service, with another 836 on the way. Instead of becoming the staple of the long haul skies, the A380 has become a niche product of the ultra luxury airlines on their longest hauls. If continued technology creates more efficient planes, they will become more novelty than niche, and eventually, will face extinction like the 747.

I am sadly yet to fly the A380, and don’t know if I’ll ever get the chance. Since I was a kid I cherished jumbo jets and was fascinated by the likes of the 747. Even though its old and wrinkly, I still get a kick out of flying on it or seeing it in the sky. The first time I saw the A380 approaching over New York, I thought the aliens had landed and I have wanted to fly it every day since. If you are an airline executive from Emirates, Singapore, Lufthansa, Qatar, Air France, Asiana, Korean Air or Qantas, give a kid a chance? I’ll write a nice review with pretty pictures….

This week during a cold morning is a Virgin Atlantic Airbus A340-600 taxing around its home base at London Heathrow Airport as it prepares for its next journey somewhere across the world.

Virgin Atlantic operate a fleet of 13 of these super-long quad-jet aircraft, which operate across the network the airline operates.

The A340-600 was introduced to replace early Boeing 747s – and is longer than a Boeing 747-400 or an Airbus A380, coming it at 75.3 meters (or 247 ft 1 inch for those who work in old money still). Only the Boeing 747-8i is longer.

Sadly the use of these planes is declining – namely due to the plane having four engines, costing money in terms of fuel and maintenance costs.

For now, the full 13 continue to operate in the Virgin Atlantic long haul fleet.

AERO INDIA: Airbus sole bidder for Indian AWACS project - Flightglobal,"Thu, 19 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWVyby1pbmRpYS1haXJidXMtc29sZS1iaWRkZXItZm9yLWluZGlhbi1hd2Fjcy1wcm9qZWN0LzExNTk1OC5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Defence & Space appears to have emerged as the sole bidder for a global tender put out by New Delhi's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) for an ""AWACS India"" programme. The tender – for six airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) system aircraft – was issued in March 2014.

Airbus submitted its proposal last October, an Airbus official confirms. Other sources indicate that the European company is the lone party to have responded to a request for proposals linked to the project.

Commercial bids have yet to be opened for the requirement, which is for an initial batch of two aircraft, followed by four more. Options to increase this fleet size to 10 could be exercised at a later stage.

Flightglobal

On display on the DRDO stand at the Aero India show in Bengaluru on 18 February was a model of an Airbus A330 fitted with a radome. Officials at the display did not provide any further information about the programme.

Airbus would have to integrate the mission systems on the aircraft and gain certification that it is safe to fly with the radome. The airframer says it has been busy replying to Indian queries on technical aspects of the programme. “It is not an easy programme, and we have to do it with fully civilian certification, as requested by DRDO,” the company source says.

If a contract is signed for the A330 as the platform for the Indian AWACS effort, it will be the first instance of the type being used in the AEW&C role. Airbus Defence & Space has also been involved in jointly reviewing New Delhi's indigenously developed AEW&C system with India's Centre for Airborne Systems, with the first Embraer EMB-145-based example likely to secure initial operational clearance later this year.

Meanwhile, Airbus is waiting for a decision on India's planned contract for its A330 multirole tanker transport, having agreed to further extend the validity of its bid until 1 July. New Delhi runs the risk of encountering a cost escalation if further delays are encountered beyond this date.

It has been more than three years since the A330 was first chosen to meet the Indian air force's tanker requirements, with a planned acquisition of six of the type.

SES bridges the Atlantic in latest satellite purchase – Spaceflight Now - Spaceflight Now,"Mon, 16 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VmbGlnaHRub3cuY29tLzIwMTUvMDIvMTYvc2VzLWJyaWRnZXMtdGhlLWF0bGFudGljLWluLWxhdGVzdC1zYXRlbGxpdGUtcHVyY2hhc2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing Satellite Systems, Airbus Defense and Space and Orbital ATK have won orders from Luxembourg-based satellite operator SES for three new communications spacecraft for launch in 2017.

SES announced the deals with three satellite manufacturers Monday for spacecraft to serve markets in the Americas, Europe, Africa and the Middle East.

The SES 14 satellite will be built by Europe’s Airbus Defense and Space for launch in the fourth quarter of 2017. Built on the Airbus Eurostar E3000e satellite bus, SES 14 will carry Ku-band, C-band and Ka-band payloads to support direct-to-home television broadcasting in the Americas, plus mobile, maritime and aeronautical communications.

The Airbus-made satellite will be positioned at 47.5/48 degrees west longitude, where SES says it will replace and expand capacity currently provided by the NSS 806 satellite launched in February 1998 by an Atlas 2AS rocket.

Boeing Satellite Systems of El Segundo, California, will build the SES 15 spacecraft — based on the Boeing 702SP platform — for launch in the second quarter of 2017. It will host Ku-band and Ka-band communications transponders for coverage over North America.

In a statement released Monday, SES said the SES 14 and SES 15 satellites “will solidify SES’s positioning in the aeronautical mobility and government markets, providing fresh capacity and coverage over major airline routes across the (North American) continent.”

SES 15 will beam in-flight WiFi and other entertainment programming to airline passengers traveling over North America.

“The procurement of SES-15 shows our strong confidence in this dynamic market. It will give us new growth momentum and strengthen our position in the important North American government and mobility markets,” said Martin Halliwell, SES chief technology officer.

The third spacecraft ordered by SES will be manufactured by Orbital ATK, marking the Virginia-based firm’s first major satellite contract since Orbital Sciences and ATK finalized their merger Feb. 9.

Orbital ATK’s GEOStar 3 platform will be the basis for the SES 16/GovSat satellite.

The mission is a partnership with the government of Luxembourg called LuxGovSat. Luxembourg has committed to purchasing a significant amount of capacity on the SES 16/GovSat satellite in support of its NATO obligations, according to SES.

“SES is one of the world’s most prominent satellite operators and this contract demonstrates a continued confidence in our GEOStar product line. As a customer-focused company known for innovation, reliability and affordability, we are pleased to provide LuxGovSat with a high-quality satellite that will meet expectations in cost, schedule and performance,” said Chris Richmond, vice president and general manager of Orbital ATK’s commercial satellite division. “Based on our exceptional record of delivering flight-proven satellites on time and on budget, Orbital ATK continues to be a partner that SES and the government of Luxembourg can count on.”

Parked in geostationary orbit at 21.5 degrees east longitude, SES 16/GovSat will operate in dedicated military frequencies in X-band and Ka-band reaching users in Europe, Africa and the Middle East.

Arrangements for launch services for the three new SES satellites have not been disclosed. All three satellites will have a launch mass of about 4,200 kilograms (9,259 pounds) or less.

Two of the satellites — SES 14 and SES 15 provided by Airbus and Boeing — will use all-electric propulsion systems to reach their final orbits after separating from their launch vehicles.

“SES once again demonstrates its responsiveness in a changing market, and we are pleased to be able to provide them with our very best technological innovation for both the payload and the platform,” said François Auque, head of space systems at Airbus. “On SES 14, as on SES 12, the mass saving from electric propulsion enables us to combine two high-capacity missions, equivalent to two conventional satellites in one satellite.”

SES 15 is Boeing’s first firm contract for an all-electric satellite since it rolled out the innovative new spacecraft bus in 2012. Boeing’s first two satellites fully relying on electric propulsion will launch at the end of February on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, followed by another pair of all-electric payloads on another Falcon 9 mission in late 2015.

Airbus has also revealed its own all-electric satellite platform, and the European company says the SES 14 order is the third win for the new spacecraft bus in a year. The last two all-electric satellites bought from Airbus by SES and Eutelsat are due for launch on Ariane 5 rockets.

The all-electric satellites do not require tanks of chemical propellant, reducing the spacecraft’s launch mass and allowing the payloads to fit on smaller, cheaper rockets.

Satellite operators choosing to buy an all-electric satellite bus are making a trade, however. Instead of taking a few weeks for a satellite to reach an operational location in geostationary orbit with conventional orbit-raising maneuvers, the all-electric platforms will take at least four months to climb to their final positions, depending on their launcher.

The SES 16/GovSat satellite built by Orbital ATK will use a traditional bi-propellant chemical propulsion system to raise its orbit, then a combination of hydrazine-fueled and electrically-powered arcjet thrusters for fine-tuning its position in space.

MARID, Spain, Feb. 18 (UPI) -- Airbus' A400M military transport and aerial refueling aircraft has successfully demonstrated refueling two F/A-18 fighters simultaneously in Spain. The company said four flights were conducted by the A400M, during which time it performed 74 contacts with fighters and dispensed nearly 30.5 tons of fuel. Advertisement

The refueling of the Spanish Air Force jets took place at two altitudes -- 20,000 feet and 33,000 feet – and at air speeds of 180 knots and 300 knots.

The A400M has a basic fuel capacity of more than 56 tons, which can be increased by the use of extra cargo hold tanks.

The A400M Atlas is a four-engine turboprop. It has a cruise speed of 421 knots and a range of 2,450 nautical miles while carrying a full payload.

It was introduced in 2013. The French Air Force, Turkish Air Force, Britain's Royal Air Force and German Air Force have so far received units from Airbus Defense and Space."

“In the course of four flights, the A400M performed 74 contacts and dispensed 27.2t of fuel” to two Spanish air force Boeing F/A-18As, Airbus says. The activity was conducted at altitudes between 20,000ft and 33,000ft, and at air speeds ranging from 180kt (333km/h) to 300kt, it adds.

Airbus Defence & Space

Describing the A400M as “the most capable tactical tanker in the market”, the company says the “Atlas” will have the ability to transfer 34t of fuel while loitering for 2h some 500nm (930km) away from its operating base. Its normal maximum fuel capacity is 50.8t, but this can be increased with the installation of additional tanks inside its cargo hold.

Airbus, which is offering the A400M refuelling capability in addition to its baseline airlift application, faces competition in the tactical tanker market from Lockheed Martin’s KC-130J. The US model is operational with the US Marine Corps and the air forces of Italy and Kuwait, and has also been ordered by Saudi Arabia. Competition to both types will also come from Embraer’s KC-390, which made its flight on 3 February.

The X4 initial design concept was launched in 2012, with two turbo-shaft engines options, Pratt & Whitney Canada’s (P&WC) PW210E and Turbomeca’s Arrano.

The decision from Airbus comes after an extensive evaluation, which suggested the need for increase in engine power, to replace its best-selling EC155 / Dauphin medium-lift passenger transport helicopter, reported Reuters.

Turbomeca said: ""This decision marks a major achievement for Turbomeca, and confirms the global competitiveness of its products and services, and more specifically the excellent technological and economic performance of the Arrano.""

""The 1,100-1,300 shaft horse-power engine is claimed to offer up to 15% in fuel efficiency, compared to other existing engines.""

Arrano completed its first bench testing in February 2014, and its type-certification is in line with milestones of the X4 programme.

Airbus said it will commence full-scale development of the X4 helicopter with an uprated Turbomeca Arrano engine.

The X4 is said to feature advanced technologies, and will be designed for various applications, including oil and gas operations, emergency medical services, public services, business and private aviation.

Airbus is preparing to showcase X4 for the first time at the HAI HELI-EXPO 2015 event, scheduled to be held in March.

P&WC will continue to support Airbus until completion of the initial phase of the X4 programme. The companies will work together to explore new opportunities, including the PW210.

Speaking in Munich to detail an overall strong group financial and operational performance for 2014, Airbus chief executive Tom Enders blamed the A400M’s woes on incomplete sub-assemblies arriving at the Seville final assembly line. Fuselages from Bremen are a particular problem, he says, but wings from Filton and inputs from other plants are also arriving in Seville needing further work.

This “travelled work” means personnel from the sub-facilities have to work temporarily in Seville, which is “very inefficient”.

However, says Enders, the change of programme management made last month is encouraging. Fernando Alonso, who replaced Domingo Ureña-Raso as head of military aircraft within the Airbus Defence & Space division, is ""a great manager coming from the commercial side"", he says, while new head of operations Pilar Albiac-Murillo comes from the automotive industry and knows how to fix a final assembly operation.

Of Airbus Defence & Space head Bernhard Gerwert, Enders adds:""I trust that he has taken the right choices.""

Further details of the financial implications of the A400M programme remediation requirements are expected to be set out in the coming weeks.

Airbus planning to raise production of single-aisle A320 to 50 per month - 台北時報,"Sat, 28 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhaXBlaXRpbWVzLmNvbS9OZXdzL2Jpei9hcmNoaXZlcy8yMDE1LzAyLzI4LzIwMDM2MTIzOTjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus planning to raise production of single-aisle A320 to 50 per month

Bloomberg





Airbus Group NV plans to boost production of its workhorse A320 single-aisle aircraft to 50 per month to meet surging demand for more fuel-efficient airliners.

The increase by the first quarter of 2017 from today’s 42 is expected to help airlines get earlier delivery slots for the A320neo models with new engines that are already sold into the next decade. Airbus disclosed the plans as it announced a 15 percent gain in last year’s profit on higher plane deliveries.

The A320 family, introduced in the late 1980s and assembled at two sites in Europe and one in China, has helped Airbus create a global duopoly with Boeing Co in the civil aircraft market, which relies predominantly on smaller airliners like the A320 and 737. Airbus’s new production plans are still below targets by Boeing for 52 single-aisle 737s per month by 2018.

Employees work on a section of an Airbus A320 wing inside the A320/A330 wing assembly building at the Airbus Group NV manufacturing plant in Broughton, Flintshire, Wales, on Feb. 5. Airbus announced that it would boost seating in its A320neo by nine to 189, and its A321neo would take as many as 240 passengers, up from 220, in a high-density, all-economy layout. Photo: Bloomberg

“Due to strong demand for single-aisle aircraft, we have decided to increase production of our A320 family to 50 aircraft a month from 2017 onwards,” Airbus CEO Tom Enders said in a statement.

The airplane manufacturer also announced a drop in production for its wide-body twin-engine A330 airplane to six per month from early next year versus 10 today.

Production is planned to climb again as the manufacturer starts building a more fuel-efficient variant with new engines, dubbed the A330neo.

Airbus confirmed its plan to break even on its A380 superjumbo this year.

Earnings at the parent company for last year before interest, tax and one-time items rose to 4.07 billion euros (US$4.56 billion) from 3.54 billion euros, beating estimates by analysts for 3.84 billion euros. The company took a charge of 551 million euros for penalties related to delays of its A400M military transport. Sales rose 5 percent to 60.7 billion euros.

Airbus proposed a record dividend of 1.20 euros per share, up 60 percent from 2013.

The European aerospace company, which draws two-thirds of sales from its airliner unit, is particularly reliant on its best-selling single-aisle series. Last year, out of 629 deliveries, 490 were short-haul models, providing the bulk of revenue.

Airbus assembles its A320 and related variants mainly in Hamburg and Toulouse in southern France, with a plant in Tianjin, China, producing four planes monthly. It plans to add four A320neos monthly by 2017 at a new plant in Mobile, Alabama.

The company predicted “slightly higher” deliveries for this year than last year, and reiterated plans to break even with its A380, which has struggled to attract fresh orders.

Sales are expected to rise this year, and Airbus said it expects a “slight” increase in operating earnings before certain items, with a break-even on cash flow before acquisitions."

Spring Airlines, an all Airbus A320 Family operator and China’s first low cost airline, has taken delivery of a new A320 at Airbus (Tianjin) Delivery Centre on lease from ICBC Financial Leasing, a leasing company owned by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. The newly received aircraft brings the carrier’s total Airbus A320 fleet to 50.

The aircraft, the 210th A320 Family aircraft assembled at the Airbus Tianjin Final Assembly Line, is powered by CFM 56 engines and is configured in an efficient lay-out with 180 economy class seats. Based in Shanghai, Spring Airlines has been an Airbus operator since July 2005.

“We are pleased to expand our all Airbus A320 fleet to 50 as we are going to celebrate our 10th anniversary in July this year. From the first to the 50th, our partnership with Airbus has lasted for 10 years. Airbus is our closest partner,” said Wang Zhenghua, Chairman of Spring Airlines. “The low cost mode that we initiated in China 10 years ago has proved to be successful and it is becoming more and more popular today. The Airbus A320 plays a key role in the successful development of low cost operations in China with its high reliability, unrivaled economics and comfort in its class.”

“The sustained development and steady growth of Spring Airlines has impressed the industry deeply,” said Eric Chen, Airbus China President. “We are proud to see that our products have supported the success of our customers. There is great potential for low cost airlines in China as the market demand for cost efficient air traffic is growing. We will provide Spring Airlines with even stronger support in the future including our innovative products and top level service.”

Derived from Spring Tourism Company, Spring Airlines took its maiden flight in 2005 as one of the first private enterprises entering into the airlines business and first positioning itself as a low cost carrier.

MUMBAI: European plane manufacturer Airbus on Monday said it has signed a contract with Dynamatic Technologies to be the single-source supplier of flap track beams for its wide-bodied A330 planes, underscoring its encouragement of the Modi government's Make in India campaign.Flap track beams are guide rails on which the wing flaps that guide the direction, speed and balance of an aircraft move. The Airbus-Dynamatic contract, which two sources confirmed as worth over $150 million, is Airbus' biggest after its pact with state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) to make forward passenger doors for its A320 planes. “We are really encouraged by the new government. It is opening up prospects of growth in the supply chain for Airbus,“ said Olivier Cauquil, senior vice-president for procurement at Airbus.Last year, Airbus and Dynamatic had signed a memorandum of understanding for the Bengaluru-based company to become a tier-1 supplier for the beams to Airbus. It already is a single source supplier for the beams on the A320s, Airbus' most popular product in the world.Airbus manufactures 100 A330s a month and Dynamatic will supply 8 of 10 beams that are fitted into each plane, said Malhoutra. That translates into 800 beams a month and roughly 9,600 a year.Under the contract, Dynamatic will also be responsible for handling the entire global supply chain contribut ing to the flap track beam and also make the complex smaller parts that go into the making of the beam, Udayant Malhoutra, CEO and managing director of Dynamatic Technologies, told ET. He said the company will begin to supply the beams to Airbus in the next 13 months.Airbus' total sourcing from India last year totalled $400 million, up more than 12 times in the last nine years, which makes it one of the fastest growing supplying countries to the plane maker, said Srinivasan Dwarakanath, managing director of Airbus India . He said Airbus' said Airbus' global procurement itself has doubled in that time, which shows how “ procurement from India has grown as chunk of the total.The Airbus engineering team in 2007 d had four people, that grew to 350 last year and will grow by another 30% in o the next few years, Dwarakanath said.o Airbus' engineering centre in Banga lore, its biggest captive centre outside ' of Europe, was launched in 2007 and contributes to design of aircraft like a the 500-800 seater A380 and the 250-350 f seater A350, said Srinivasan. Airbus , training centre teaches plane mainte0 nance to carriers in India and neighbouring countries in the Middle-East.It set up a pilot training centre in 2008 e via a tie-up with CAE, a Canadian maker of simulators."

Attendees at the HAI (Helicopter Association International) Heli-Expo 2015, the world’s largest helicopter exposition and trade show, will be among the first to see Papillon Group’s “Golden Helicopter,” created to celebrate the company’s 50th golden anniversary. The show will take place Tuesday, March 3 through Thursday, March 5. This occasion provides a rare opportunity to see the special edition helicopter, which will be located at Airbus Helicopters booth No. 2437. Media are invited to join Papillon and Airbus Helicopters executives for a special champagne toast that will take place on the first day of the show at 12:45 p.m.

Papillon ordered the specially painted and equipped Airbus Helicopters EC130 T2, the world’s leading aerial tour helicopter, to mark its 50th anniversary as the largest and longest running helicopter tour company in the world. “We are celebrating this special year in our company’s history by placing into service this extraordinary, customized helicopter,” says Brenda Halvorson, president and CEO, Papillon Group.

“We are honored Papillon and the Halvorson family decided to have this beautiful helicopter produced for the company’s 50th anniversary,” said Marc Paganini, president and CEO, Airbus Helicopters Inc. “This is such a momentous year for Papillon. All of us at Airbus Helicopters are proud Papillon has repeatedly selected our helicopters for its business and we pledge to work every day to provide great service and support.”

Papillon’s story began in 1965, thanks to the vision of Elling Halvorson, who was a young contractor at the time charged with building a 13.5-mile-long water pipeline from the North Rim to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. It was during this project Halvorson was first introduced to helicopters, which he used to lower sections of pipeline into place. Upon completion of the project, he recognized the incredible opportunity to utilize helicopters for air tours and Grand Canyon Helicopters was born. The company would go on to make history by becoming one of the first aerial sightseeing companies in the world and the first helicopter tour operator to fly the Grand Canyon. Years later, as the company expanded into Hawaiian tour operations, it adopted the name Papillon Helicopters.

Halvorson’s daughter, Brenda, and son, Lon, both joined the company in the late ’80s. Brenda Halvorson has served as president and chief executive officer of Papillon Group for the past two decades. Under her leadership the business has grown by more than 600 percent. Lon Halvorson, who is well known and respected in the helicopter industry, serves as executive vice president. He oversees fleet acquisition and financing, and manages large fleet agreements with aircraft manufacturers. He has helped grow Papillon’s fleet from 23 airplanes and helicopters to 75 in the past 20 years. The company is now welcoming a third generation of family into the business to ensure the legacy continues.

The concept of a symbolic 50th anniversary helicopter was several years in the making. The unique gold livery with red eagle is a reversal of Papillon’s traditional red livery-and-gold eagle design. The original livery was designed by Airbus Helicopters, along with Papillon executives, in 2002 as a throwback to the original Grand Canyon helicopter logo designed by Elling Halvorson in 1965. The interior package for this helicopter was created and manufactured by Andy Mirabelli, owner, American Aircraft Interiors.

The Airbus Helicopters’ EC130 T2 is a light single-engine helicopter equipped with the latest navigation and safety technology and a spacious modular cabin that can accommodate one pilot plus up to seven passengers. It is the quietest helicopter on the market: its Fenestron tail rotor and automatic variable rotor speed control result in a significantly reduced external sound level.

The HAI Heli-Expo 2015 will take place at the Orange County Convention Center. The show floor hours will be Tuesday, March 3, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Wednesday, March 4, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Thursday, March 5, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

The helicopter will be officially unveiled to the public on Thursday, April 16 in Las Vegas during Papillon’s 50th anniversary celebration."
Would you trust a jet engine that came out of a PRINTER? Engineer designs world-first engine with cutting edge ... - Daily Mail,"Thu, 26 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTI5Njk4ODcvV291bGQtdHJ1c3QtamV0LWVuZ2luZS1jYW1lLVBSSU5URVItRW5naW5lZXItZGVzaWducy13b3JsZC1lbmdpbmUtY3V0dGluZy1lZGdlLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktQm9laW5nLUFpcmJ1cy1zaG93bi1pbnRlcmVzdC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Researchers at Monash University, in collaboration with their spin out company Amaero, have created the world’s first 3D-printed jet engine, possibly revolutionising the design and cost of aerospace materials .

Amaero is already working with six tier-one air space companies, however, with the unit currently on display at Avalon International Air show, the engine is also capturing the attention of commercial outfitters like Boeing and Airbus.

David Lyster, Monash University Manger of Major Collaborations, told The Daily Mail Australia it’s a ‘very exciting time’ with overwhelming interest in the prototype and the possible capabilities of 3D printing.

Breakthrough: The 3D printer attracted interest of major manufacturers while on display at the Avalon International Air show in Melbourne, Australia.

Scientists call it additive manufacturing but to you and I, its 3D laser printing.

Most people are aware of how plastic printers work, the printer head runs back and forth dribbling plastic ink along the page, for metal printing it’s a whole different ball game.

Engineers start with a bed of fine powder which is laid down in a very thin base (40 micrometers). Once there is a uniform layer, a laser is used to melt the powder where they want to form a solid part of the structure. From there it’s only several thousand more layers of powder to go down before the product is complete.

Dirty work: The 3D printing process involves layers of very fine powder before a laser is used to form the solid structure

Project leader and visionary, Professor Xinhua Wu, says most jet engines are very complex, taking up to 6-24 months to produce.

‘The benefit of 3D printing is we can cut down the manufacture time of those components to 1-2 weeks,’ says Professor Wu.

‘Simple or complex- 3D printing doesn’t care, it produces it in the same time’

Final product: Professor Xinhua Wu(pictured above) with the 3D printing innovation

Although Amaero are the owners of the biggest 3D printer in the world they say its unlikely the device would be used to print whole planes as it’s ideally suited to ‘highly complex and high value adding components.’

For this reason Dr Lyster can't see 3D printing is replace mass produced products.

Dr Lyster told the Daily Mail Australia manufacturing turn around for smaller components will significantly reduce as process’ that once took up to 13 different manufacturing steps and 5-6 months to complete could be produced in as little as three stages and only five days.

A laser meticulously melts away at each layer to produce the printed engine

Not only do we ‘improve functioning and decrease manufacturing cost,’ there is a huge reduction in waste as around 99-100% of the powder used ends up being used in the final product, unlike metal which ‘often ends up on the workshop floor,’ says Dr Lyster.

‘People are only just getting around the flexibility 3D printing provides,’ Dr Lyster says.

The research team set up spin off company Amaero two years ago, with a federal grant from Commercialisation Australia, to allow the manufacturing on Australian shores.

Lyster says the company’s relationship with multiple tier one air space companies has bought them to the forefront of strategic innovation, with the next challenge to establish Amearo as a world leader in 3D printing.

“A number of our companies really believe we can do what we are doing better than anyone else,” Dr Lyster told the Daily Mail Australia.

Researchers watch on as the printer produces several thousand layers to create aerospace components

The sky is NOT the limit with Lyster’s sights set on entering the biomedical science sphere. Amaero is currently working with Australian and Chinese hospitals and staff looking for new and innovative ways of incorporating 3D printing into the medical world.

‘Demand for product development is so high Amaero is going to have to look at expanding,’ says Lyster.

He says now Amaero has comfortably made a mark in the aero industry he is very keen to start working with Australian manufacturers to expand into different industries like biomedical."

In the two minute video incredible shots of the jets taking a turn around the mountain, taken from 20 cameras both in the air and on the ground, are spliced with footage of a skier speeding down the famous downhill course.

The course is the longest in the world at 2.78 miles, resulting in run times of two and a half minutes - about 30-45 seconds longer than standard downhill races, with top speeds approaching 100 mph for the top racers.

The Lauberhorn downhill run is surrounded by the Eiger, Monch and Jungfrau mountains above the Lauterbrunnen valley.

In the video the skill of all the pilots involved is there for all to see as they cruise in effortless harmony above the bright white peaks to an exhilarating soundtrack.

Observers from below can only look on in wonder as the aircraft bank at seemingly impossible angles, with the fighter pilots even turning their F-5E's upside down at one point.

Just as the skier never strays off piste they are always in control, though the pilots of the Airbus are shown having the occasional peek outside the cockpit to check exactly where their cohorts are.

The HD-quality film was compiled from more than 60 hours of footage, and features a soundtrack specially composed for the occasion.

It offers a glimpse behind the scenes of the whole exercise including cockpit views of the nine pilots involved which provide previously unseen perspectives of the air show.

The film was produced to celebrate the fourth consecutive year of SWISS' partnership with the Lauberhorn International Ski Races in what was their 85th edition.



SWISS is Switzerland’s national airline, serving 104 destinations in 48 countries from Zurich, Geneva and Basel and carrying some 16 million passengers a year with its 91-aircraft fleet.

It has 8,250 staff, is part of the Lufthansa Group and is also a member of Star Alliance, the world’s biggest airline network.

This new Airbus Helicopters Polska facility is to be assigned a wide variety of mechanical design activities, with a focus on future breakthrough technologies in such areas as rotorcraft drive systems and equipment. Design work in the office will cover military and commercial helicopters, new-design platforms, and modernization of existing rotorcraft types.

“We see a significant potential from Poland, particularly with its young and skilled engineers who can contribute to a new way of bringing innovation to our products and systems,” said Guillaume Faury, the President of Airbus Helicopters. “Our goal is to have Airbus Helicopters Polska directly involved with us in many fields, including organization, processes and design. This underscores our commitment to working with Poland for the long term.”

Airbus Helicopters already has benefited from its 10-year cooperation with Poland, which has involved the Łódź University of Technology, and recently the Technical University of Radom, as well as the Gdańsk University of Technology. As part of this activity, Airbus Helicopters’ development of its record-breaking X3 high-speed hybrid demonstrator aircraft was assisted by the Lodz University of Technology’s work on propellers, aerodynamic optimization and engine integration. Polish engineers also have contributed to the development of the Tiger attack helicopter and the EC725 Caracal multi-role-helicopter.

The newly-inaugurated Airbus Helicopters Polska engineering design office is located in central Łódź at the Forum 76 Business Center. It is the fourth such facility established by Airbus Helicopters in Europe, along with operations in France, Germany and Spain.

Airbus Helicopters is the leading Western rotorcraft manufacturer in Poland with 54 helicopters currently operating in the country. The company provides comprehensive maintenance repair and overhaul (MRO) services to this fleet through Warsaw-based Heli-Invest – the Airbus Helicopters’ local distributor and partner.

In addition, Airbus Helicopters is the only company to have successfully performed an important training program in Poland that enabled the transition from Soviet-era helicopters to modern rotorcraft."
ACEs high - A350XWB pilot training - Royal Aeronautical Society,"Fri, 20 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9zb2NpZXR5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2FjZXMtaGlnaC1hMzUweHdiLXBpbG90LXRyYWluaW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The quality of airline pilots' manual flying skillls are now a key issue for the air transport industry. TIM ROBINSON takes a look at Airbus’s radical new A350 flight crew training philosophy.



Inside the A350 XWB FFS. With the A350 conversion course — students will experience the motion simulator at a very early stage.

It has been widely understood for a time now that flight training for airlines has become increasingly outdated and obsolete. While it still produces competent pilots, there have been concerns that it has not kept pace with either the advances in learning or training in other sectors (See ‘Wake-up call’, AEROSPACE, November 2014). Additionally, there has been a huge change in aircraft technology since the first airline pilot training courses were standardised. In particular, the training dates from a time of multi-crew aircraft (with navigator, engineer and even radio operator), analogue gauges and unreliable engines. Today, two-crew flight decks are the norm, glass cockpits (and fly-by-wire (FBW)) dominate and a pilot may go his (or her) whole working life without experiencing an engine failure — let alone an ‘engine failure on take-off’ — the traditional 'gold standard' of pilot skills trained for in the simulator.



Yet while the training system still produces skilled pilots – recent accidents and incidents have led to questions about the type of pilot being produced. AF447, Colgan Air and Asiana Airlines all highlighted deficiencies in critical areas – leading to concerns that pilots are becoming too reliant on automation and losing vital flying skills. Partly this can be down to industry itself. It might be argued, for example, that the introduction of FBW, FMS and glass cockpits meant that their advantages were over-emphasised to win over older, sceptical captains, and not enough attention was paid to the downsides. Airline standard operating procedures (SOP)s which discouraged manual handling too have had a part to play in this.



However, the industry has been addressing this and progress is being made. MPL is one advance, along with cross-industry initiatives such as the IPTC (International Pilot Training Consortium) of which the RAeS is itself a member.



While the MPL may be the first example of this new training philosophy for introducing ab initio students to the concepts of CRM and multi-crew cockpits, Airbus’s new A350 XWB flight crew training takes this one stage further, updating type rating training.

Thus, as well as aiming to set the industry benchmark for type conversion training, Airbus also saw the introduction of the A350 as an opportunity to adopt new training paradigms, such as evidence-based training (EBT), leverage its massive training experience (2,000+ trainees annually) and evolve the Airbus Pilot Transition Course (APT2) that was introduced in 2004.

Training philosophy

So what goes into this new training philosophy? Airbus says there are three targets — making the training more effective, efficient and ‘fun’. This last aim may seem out-of-place for some but research over past decades has shown how retention of knowledge is improved the more interactive it becomes. In fact, the highest levels of retention (90%) stem from teaching information to someone else. While reading hovers at 10%, and audio-visual learning at 20%, discussion and practice methods give 50% and 75% retention levels respectively. In this instructors are set to move from a one-way briefings or lectures to discussion and ‘facilitating discovery’. Airbus’s new training philosophy thus takes elements from how we learn to operate smartphones/or tablet computers today — not by reading thick manuals, but by interaction and trying it out.



The new course is a major shakeup in both technology and approach. Traditionally, a type conversion would consist of ground school divided into study of manuals, CBT (computer-based training), part task trainers (PTT) with full-flight simulator (FFS) work. Airbus’s course divides into system knowledge and PTTs, then a fixed-base (but high fidelity ) APT+ before the full-motion sim. The course also incorporates as its basis evidence-based training (EBT) and competency-based training (CBT) — new paradigms for airliner pilot training. For CBT, Airbus has identified nine ‘core competencies’ for airline pilots, based on ICAO regulations from 2013. These are knowledge, workload management, situation awareness, communication, manual flight, application of procedures, auto flight, leadership and teamwork and finally problem solving and decision-making. With competency-based training there is no standard pass/fail grading, simply competent/not yet competent.



In short, this latest conversion course, the development of which began in 2010, was to become a radical revamp of Airbus’s flight crew training philosophy. Says Captain Christian Norden, Director A350 Flight Operations and Training Support: “We decided not to make a copy and paste course.” He added: “It would be driven by trainees needs, not by the devices”.

ACE laptop

Airbus ACE laptop-based training tool, features a 'virtual' A350 cockpit and avionics systems to explore in intercative lessons and limited 'free play' mode.

For those pilots transitioning to the A350, the first encounter with the A350 will be in a 3D ‘virtual’ form in a sophisticated simulation of the aircraft on a laptop — or the ACE (Airbus Cockpit Experience). This laptop training device functions as a PTT, allows trainees to develop system knowledge and procedures as well as standard operating procedures (SOPs). This ‘virtual’ A350 allows students to click cockpit switches, navigate FMS menus with the systems responding and interacting like the real thing.

The ground phase of the conversion course sees the ACE laptop integrated with ‘A350 system knowledge modules’ (SKM) which can be seen as a ‘quick user guide’ to the A350s avionics which break the complex systems (eg ECAM) into manageable chunks with the student learning about the system first before a practical lesson shows its operational uses. In this way, the functions of the aircraft’s complex systems are absorbed quicker, as they student gets to put them into practice. Theory is learned in parallel with simulation. As noted above — putting this knowledge into practice straight away is expected to boost retention rates from around 20% using the ‘linear media’ of traditional computer-based training, to approximately 75% with the new method. It is also quicker — with an emphasis on ‘need to understand’. Compared with 36hrs of traditional CBT, the new SKM modules are less than 20 hours.

Facilitating discovery



The ACE part of the course is also divided into step-by-step lessons (which are interactive and even feature a ‘virtual’ pilot flying/pilot non-flying, who will flick switches and controls on their side of the cockpit) and ‘free play’/exploration type learning. Around 70% of the ACE course is lesson-based, with around 30% ‘limited free play’ with the instructor ‘facilitating discovery’.



This approach has benefits in that when students progress to the next level of training in either the ATP+ or FFS, the instructor need not waste time testing 80% competencies the student is fine with, but the 20% that they need help with.



Another indication of the new approach and training philosophy from Airbus is in grading and evaluation. For example, while the student’s every single mouse movements, key presses or interactions with the software could be easily recorded, tracked and measured to produce statistics of progress — it is not, since the training focus has now moved away from of ‘constant tests’. Instead, it has been found that giving students the space and time to make errors or mistakes in training is more beneficial.



During training, students can also take the ACE laptop home to practise in their free time and Airbus are also considering an affordable licensing option to allow pilots to permanently have the ACE training installed on their laptop — so they could in theory use it anytime in their career for refresher or recurrent training.

APT+

The fixed-base APT+ device made by CAE features throttles, sidesticks, rudders and visuals.

Another improvement in the training tools is the Airbus Pilot Transition (APT+) (or as one Airbus insider noted “it's really a FFS minus”). The fixed- based device, built by CAE, uses large touch screens for the aircraft MFDs, centre console, and even overhead panel. However, it also includes real sidesticks, throttles and pedals — as well as (limited) visuals, allowing it to be ‘flown’ in representative training flights.



Indeed, such now is the improved fidelity of the FTD+ fixed-base system that those undergoing A330 conversion can transition from the A330 to the A350 in just eight days (provided they are current on the A330) and they do not even need to step inside the FFS. For those on the 23-day full type conversion course, time on the APT+ training consists of six days.

Full flight simulator

The FFS at Airbus’s training centre in Toulouse.

Finally there is the full-flight simulator (FFS) — certificated to Level D compliance. The device, built, by CAE, features the latest in high-fidelity visuals. The motion system, too, is extremely realistic — especially when the aircraft's FBW protections and go arounds are being demonstrated.



While the A350 has much in common with the A380 cockpit — there are subtle improvements built-in to enhance safety and efficiency. For instance, information from the side EFB (electronic flight bag) displays can brought up on the centre console — so that both pilots can see it — highly useful when, for example, airport charts or electronic manuals are being consulted.



Another new feature for the A350 demonstrated in the FFS motion simulator was a new ‘soft’ go around thrust mode which gives sufficient power for the manoeuvre but is less dramatic. This is intended not only to provide a smoother experience for passengers but also to keep the crews mindset that this is a ‘normal’ operation — rather than an abnormal emergency, which can lead to pilots overcontrolling after a go around.

Back to ‘flying school’

Perhaps one of the biggest shake-ups on Airbus’s A350 XWB course, is that the full-flight simulator is introduced early in the course — on only day eight of the 23-day full conversion course. Says Captain Norden: “It puts the pilot in the ‘office’ as soon as possible.” Unofficially nicknamed ‘flying school’ in the begining by Airbus internal trainers, the early exposure to the full-up motion simulator, is aimed at demystifying FBW and showing how, despite the A350s advanced systems, it still obeys the same power and pitch laws as a Cessna. Indeed, it is conceivable that if the student is making progress in understanding the basics in the sim, they could be just told — ‘make a visual approach at that airport down there’. For those highly proficient students, the instructor can also introduce degraded aircraft conditions. In essence, this early session emphasises that the A350 is an aircraft first, computer second, rather than the other way around.



For those pilots without Airbus FBW experience, nine days out of the 23 day course are spent in the FFS, culminating in a skills test on the final day. The FFS also introduces four ‘scenario-based’ training sessions at the end of the course which give students complex, realistic and operational-style flights in the simulator. Overall, the aim of the course is to maximise the student’s time in the FFS for handling and realistic operational-style training.

Common type rating

However, the training course in not a ‘one size fits all’. Under Airbus’s Common Crew Qualification (CCQ) and Common Type Rating (CTR) rules — the length of the course varies depending on whether the trainee is coming from a non-Airbus background (23 days), is already qualified on the A320 family (11 days) or is current on the A330 (eight days). With 70% of A350 customers already operating the A330, this will be extremely useful for airline customers.



This ease of transition between the A350 and the A330/A320 is set to benefit airlines in the form of recurrent training allowing mixed fleet flying (MFF) with A320s and single fleet flying (SFF) with A330s. Swapping crews between types, it has been found, brings extra job satisfaction, avoids staleness and, crucially for the airline, brings huge flexibility in rostering and operations.

Feedback

The aviation industry is, by nature, extremely conservative — and this sort of shake-up in training (though much-discussed in conferences and seminars) cannot be brought in unilaterally without official approval and certification by regulators. The Operational Evaluation Board process ran from July–September 2014 and involved four evaluators from ESA and the FAA, as well as 16 pilots from the EASA and FAA who tested the courses. The final test was an evaluation of the training course in a real aircraft, with 125 landings and 35hrs flown.



Feedback, says, Airbus has been overwhelmingly positive — with rave reviews from both regulators and customers. Statements like ‘Learning by Discovery: big thumbs up’, ‘It’s brilliant’, ‘Potential of the new learning tools is fantastic’, ‘Also a big thumbs up for the concept of first flying session in the FFS’ indicates that Airbus, is indeed, on the right path. By December 2014 Airbus had trained 60 A350 pilots for its first customers — with Qatar taking delivery of its first XWB in December.

The way forward

Visuals inside the CAE-built A350 XWB FFS are of an extremely high standard — with moving traffic on roads below.

But this new training approach will not be just limited to A350 training. Airbus plans to expand ACE to A330 training in 2015 and then across the A320 training family from 2016 — creating a new benchmark in type conversion training that is sure to be studied closely by the rest of the industry.



Another change from Airbus’ training centre, which first opened some 40 years ago, is that the company and its customers are now global. Says Fabrice Hamel, Vice-President Training Services: “20-30 years ago customers were happy to come to us in Toulouse. However, today, airlines have financial constraints and prefer to do their training nearby.” To that end, Airbus is set to expand its already impressive global training network with two new A350 centres set to open in 2015, one in Singapore (in conjunction with Singapore Airlines) and one in Mexico City. Airbus sees a short-term need for four-to-five A350 XWB full-flight simulators.



However, while ‘making learning fun’ may aid retention, efficiency and produce satisfied customers — it is clear that this ‘evidence-based training’ also requires a new mindset and approach from instructors. Much as the introduction of CRM revolutionised the concept of hierarchy and command on the flightdeck, so ‘facilitating discovery’ and non-judgmental training requires a new breed of training instructors — able to bring out the best in students — rather than slavishly seeing every session through a binary pass/fail prism. With this course, the focus is not simply on spotting students mistakes but finding the underlying reasons behind them, to concentrate on the relevant ‘core competencies’.



However, interestingly, talking to insiders, that culture change may be easier than one might think. Society at large has moved on and, as noted earlier, a revamp of airliner training has been well overdue.

Summary

Training revolution? The new A350XWB conversion course training will be expanded to other Airbus airliners. (Airbus)

In short, this new training model which features ‘learning by discovery’ is set to become the new benchmark for airliner type conversion — updating training from reading (and attempting to remember) thick manuals to the age of ‘learning by exploring’ technology that is now intuitive for the smartphone/iPad generation. However, critically, the early ‘flying school’ session also goes back to basics to remind pilots transitioning to the A350, that, however big and complex the glass cockpit displays, the aircraft still has wings and engines and will obey the laws of physics. It emphasises that FBW protection systems are an aid, not a replacement, for traditional piloting skills.



The functional training using the ACE laptop software also closely links theory and practice, breaking down complex systems into smaller digestible chunks of knowledge. Using a competency-based training approach means that the programme is based on the development of competencies. Says Fabrice Hamel of the A350 XWB course: “It is a fundamental change in the philosophy of training.”



Thus, while incorporating new tools and innovative learning methods, Airbus’s flight crew training also goes back to basics, reinforcing ‘pure’ flying skills and presenting students with realistic, operational scenarios — with the aim of giving 21st century A350 pilots the ace factor.

About Smoke and Vision

The FAA recommends that aircraft meet higher standards for continuous cockpit smoke protection (FAA AC25.109). The Air Line Pilots Association’s (ALPA) in-flight fire project reported more than 1,100 in-flight smoke and fire incidents over only 10 months, causing 360 emergency landings. FAA’s concern about smoke continues - this is still a “serious” problem and the statistics are essentially unchanged (Info 10019 10/6/10). Flight Safety Foundation ranks smoke/fire emergencies as the 3rd highest cause of fatalities. Smoke is also a leading cause of diversions of ETOPS aircraft.

EVAS - winner of the Aerospace Industry Award for Safety, with over 80 FAA and global certifications – has earned acceptance in every segment of aviation. The alarming rate of smoke incidents has been addressed by more than 600 operators, including the US military, FAA, airlines, and corporate flight departments. All have done so using the more than 3000 EVAS systems delivered by VisionSafe.

UPS is the 1st air cargo carrier to commit an entire fleet to EVAS. In 2003 Fed Ex joined industry leader JetBlue Airways as one of the first airlines to address smoke in the cockpit by installing EVAS.

About VisionSafe

VisionSafe Corporation was formed to explore various new ways to provide vision in vision impaired conditions for individuals in common land and air environments as well as marine, submarine, and scuba diving environments. In the process, the company developed and patented the EVAS system for pilots to see to safely control and land when confronted with dense, blinding smoke in the cockpit. The system has been certified by the Federal Aviation Administration since 2001.

""Airbus has invested in development, training, tooling and quality systems to set up advanced manufacturing facilities in India, which is in line with the government's 'Make in India' programme,"" Dynamatic chief executive Udayant Malhoutra was quoted by IANS.

The high-tech engineering firm is also a sole source supplier of airframe assemblies to American rotorcraft maker Bell Helicopter and Textron Systems, following a seven-year global agreement November 2014 for the latter's new chopper models, a four-blade, single engine civil utility helicopter.

""India was one of the fastest aviation growth markets and will be one of the largest over the next two decades. With the new deal, the French aerospace firm was expanding its global footprint into the sub-continent by making Dynamatic one of its new single source tier-one supplier,"" Airbus India managing director Srinivasan Dwarakanath said.

""The agreement is the largest manufacturing contract between Airbus and a private firm in India, elevating Dynamatic to a global tier-one supplier for us,"" he added.

With industrial partnerships spanning engineering, manufacturing, research and technology and services, Airbus has sourced its requirements worth $400 million in 2014.

Airbus' Indian subsidiary employs 350 engineers at its Bengaluru centre and has 35 supply chain partners across the country."

""We are in the selection process, talking to different industries to form a JV (joint venture),"" Rainer Farid, a senior Airbus Helicopters executive told Reuters on the sidelines of the Aero India airshow in Bengaluru on Friday.

Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""Make in India"" initiative, foreign contractors used to selling directly to New Delhi must form partnerships with local companies and transfer more of the work to help grow the nascent defence industry.

The government last year scrapped the planned acquisition of 197 light utility helicopters so that it could launch a new competition reserved for domestic companies that form joint ventures with foreign suppliers.

In addition to Airbus, other firms including US-based Sikorsky Aircraft and Russian Helicopters are also expected to bid for the order.

State-run Hindustan Aeronautics is the only Indian company producing helicopters, meaning that global defence firms are likely to have to partner with a private company building a product for the first time and from scratch.

Airbus executive Farid said that was a concern. ""It is a tough task because you need to establish your vendors here which are not as existent as in other countries,"" he added.

Foreign ownership in joint ventures in defence industry is limited to 49 per cent, but foreign companies say majority ownership would speed up India's drive for its own manufacturing base and ensure quality.

On February 23, rival Cebu Pacific announces it is selling 6 aircraft to the same Las Vegas-based airline

MANILA, Philippines – Philippine Airlines Incorporated (PAL) is selling two Airbus aircraft to Las Vegas-based Allegiant Air, as announced Wednesday, February 25.

Only on Monday, February 23, PAL’s rival, Cebu Air Incorporated (Cebu Pacific), said it is selling 6 aircraft to the same Las Vegas-based, low cost carrier.

In a statement, Nasdaq-listed Allegiant Travel Company announced it has entered into an agreement to purchase two additional Airbus A320 aircraft from PAL, set to be included in the Allegiant operating fleet toward the end of 2015.

Allegiant Air continues to be “successful in finding high quality, used aircraft to support our future growth” and the aircraft from PAL have 177 seats in the same configuration as the airline’s current A320s, said Jude Bricker, senior vice president of planning of Allegiant Travel.

Bricker said Allegiant Air is buying the PAL aircraft in cash, citing its strong balance sheet allowing it to both find aircraft to support future growth and return cash to shareholders through its previously announced recurring dividend and continuation of its existing share repurchase program.

Allegiant Air’s capital expenditures for 2015 amount to approximately $230 million, including the acquisition of two Airbus A319 set to be delivered this year.

Refleeting program

PAL delayed the complete delivery of close to 40 aircraft by 4 years after the Lucio Tan Group successfully took back full ownership of the airline from San Miguel Corporation (SMC) for a total consideration of $1.3 billion. (READ: Clipping PAL’s ‘too many wings’)

The PAL Group, including PAL Express, currently operates 73 aircraft after it sold 20 ageing aircraft, including its Boeing 747 fleet.

Such deferments come at no additional cost to the airline, stating that PAL has agreed “in principle” with Airbus, the manufacturer of the aircraft, PAL president and chief operating officer Jaime Bautista previously said.

The airline executive also reiterated that the LT Group would continue to look for a foreign, strategic partner within a 3-year timeframe.

The strategic partner could take as high as a 40% stake in the airline under Philippine laws to help finance the acquisition of additional aircraft for long-haul destinations, Bautista said. – Rappler.com"
"KAI, KAL squaring off in homegrown fighter project - koreatimes","Fri, 06 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYXRpbWVzLmNvLmtyL3BhZ2VzL2FydGljbGUuYXNwLzE3MzE0MtIBP2h0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYXRpbWVzLmNvLmtyL3BhZ2VzL2FydGljbGUuYW1wLmFzcD9uZXdzSWR4PTE3MzE0Mg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A proposed KF-X aircraft



By Kang Seung-woo

Korean Air's planned participation in the nation's indigenous fighter program has finally set up a two-horse race. The other competitor is Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI).

The 8.7 trillion won ($8 billion) project, codenamed KF-X, is to build F-16 plus class jets with the help of global defense contractors to fill a fighter gap expected over the next decade.

Korean Air recently teamed up with Airbus Defence and Space, while KAI plans to take advantage of technology transfers from Lockheed Martin in the F-X program, which will see Korea buy 40 F-35 stealth fighters from the U.S. firm.

Aviation pundits said that each player is heading to the KF-X with its own fighting chance.

""Of the Korean companies, KAI has more experience producing fighter jets,"" said Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor of Flightglobal, an aviation and aerospace industry website.

""In addition to the T-50 program, it also has experience in other production and re-manufacturing work. In short, with Lockheed's help it has participated in the development of a fighter from start to finish.""

KAI and Lockheed co-developed the T-50 supersonic trainer jet in 2001 and the Korean company, based in Sacheon, South Gyeongsang Province, has also manufactured its aerobatic and combat variants, namely the T-50B, TA-50 and FA-50, as well as the Surion utility helicopter.

James Hardy, Asia-Pacific editor of IHS Jane's Defense Weekly, echoed Waldron.

""KAI would seem to have a major advantage in that it has already produced designs for the KF-X and has a proven record with the T-50 program,"" said Hardy.

""That will be extremely difficult for DAPA to ignore.""

DAPA stands for the Defense Acquisition Program Administration.

In terms of the foreign partners ― Lockheed and Airbus ― the U.S. company seems to be more assertive. Airbus Defence and Space is a descendant of Airbus Military ― a subdivision of the defunct EADS. EADS competed with Lockheed and Boeing in the F-X program.

""Lockheed Martin will push its experience with the F-35, its work on the T-50, and its successful partnership,"" said Hardy.

""It will also play up the transfer of technology that this will play as part of the F-35 sale.""

Waldron also questioned Airbus' technology and knowhow to contribute to an advanced, modern fighter aircraft.

""Airbus Military is mainly focused on transports and tankers. They are very good at what they do,"" he said.

Currently, Airbus is also vying with Boeing and Israel's IAI in Korea's purchase of four aerial refueling tankers.

However, analysts also say that Korean Air can appeal to the nation's arms procurement agency.

""Korean Air may look to EADS to leverage its experience with the Eurofighter Typhoon, which fulfills many of the 4.5 gen fighter requirements outlined by the KFX requirement,"" said Hardy.

The Typhoon is an aircraft that EADS promoted in the F-X program against Boeing's F-15 Silent Eagle and the F-35. Korean Air also built the Air Force's KF-5E/F under license between 1982 and 1986.

DAPA's assessment on bids from KAI and KAL will be comprised of 80 points for the technological capabilities and 20 for price.

However, Waldron expressed concerns over the transfer of technology from Lockheed to KAI.

""Given the sensitivity around designing a new fighter, and the complicated technology involved, it is often difficult to tell, from the outside, the level of technological transfer that really takes place,"" he said.

""Another element that cannot be ignored is that a great deal of the technological knowhow that Lockheed possesses is controlled by the U.S. government. The U.S. government will, no doubt, have a great degree of influence in the U.S. content that goes into a foreign fighter design developed with U.S. assistance.""

In July, the Joint Chiefs of Staff decided to go with a two-engine platform for the project.

Korea and Indonesia have agreed to a joint engineering and development agreement ― the latter paying 20 percent of the program costs and later buying 50 aircraft.

However, Waldron said the signing may adversely affect the transfer of technology.

""Some industry observers have told me that Indonesia's 20 percent involvement in the KF-X program could be of concern to the U.S.,"" he said.

""The U.S. government trusts South Korea, but could have concerns about very sensitive technology making its way to Indonesia.""

Indonesia was under a U.S. arms embargo until 2005.

The KF-X, initiated by the late former President Kim Dae-jung in March 2001, had been delayed due to budget constraints and questions over its feasibility.

The Air Force plans to secure 120 new jets to replace its aging fleet of F-4s and F-5s under the project.

DAPA is scheduled to close the bidding process on Monday to select a preferred bidder in March before a final selection by the first half of the year."

In an interview, Christian Scherer, executive vice-president (head of marketing and sales) and member of executive committee at Airbus Defence and Space GmbH, said it has started discussions with its preferred partner L&T for such a facility.

Airbus Group’s plan comes at a time when India’s armed forces is increasingly relying on indigenously developed radars, designed by a unit of Defence Research and Development Organisation and Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL), to replace old Russian radars.

India is trying to localize radar production through the experience gained by building radars for missile systems such as Akash, ballistic missile defence, the sonars for nuclear submarine, among others.

Also, radars are increasingly software-intensive—a field that India has built capabilities.....

Scherer was visiting India for the 10th biennial edition of International Aerospace and Defence Exhibition—Aero India 2015—at Air Force Station Yelahanka near Bengaluru.

“Given the security scenario of our country, it is very important that India becomes self-sufficient in defence and defence production,"" defence minister Manohar Parrikar said on Wednesday.

Scherer said L&T has the first right of refusal for picking up at least 51% stake in the radar manufacturing project in which Airbus Group will own 49%.

L&T declined to comment.

Asked about the location of radar manufacturing site, Scherer said Airbus Group has received several solicitations from state governments.

“We are yet to finalize the same,"" he said.

Airbus Defence and Space manufactures radar and surveillance products ranging from active electronically scanning array radar systems to optronics for the defence, security and space industry.

Detection solutions ensure the identification and tracking of air, land and naval targets.

The security radars family from Airbus is used for security applications such as border security, surveillance of coastlines, critical perimeters and infrastructures.

These radars can also be used in mobile applications, for example, they can be integrated into surveillance vehicles.

Photos: behind the scenes at the Airbus A380 factory - Executive Traveller,"Tue, 17 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vcGhvdG9zLWJlaGluZC10aGUtc2NlbmVzLWF0LXRoZS1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1mYWN0b3J5LWluLWhhbWJ1cmfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Have you ever wondered how the monstrous Airbus A380 gets its wings before arriving at your boarding gate just like any other jet?

The process actually starts in thirty different countries, with no less than 1,500 companies manufacturing roughly four million individual parts that will later come together to form the world's largest passenger aircraft.

That all happens at the Airbus factories in Toulouse (France) and here in Germany, where Australian Business Traveller toured Hamburg's Finkenwerder Airport (XFW, if you're into airport codes) and the company's A380 Major Component Assembly facility.

Situated in Hangar 260, the first thing you notice is its sheer size.

This is no ordinary plane shed, clocking in at 228 metres long and 120 metres wide – in which you could fit 104 full-sized tennis courts with room to spare!

Here, the front and rear fuselage sections are assembled from parts produced elsewhere...

... and can be moved around the hangar with ease using a ceiling-mounted crane system.

Factory workers, of which there are 645 in this hangar alone, can reach any section of an aircraft-to-be through a network of specially-designed jigs:

Rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, aircraft shells are moved from one area of the hangar to the next as construction progresses – again with jigs to support the task at hand:

Once the A380 starts to take shape, mechanical and electrical systems make their first appearance.

That includes everything from water supply and air conditioning right through to the aircraft doors, windows and floor panels:

Signs are displayed next to each assembly area to indicate the aircraft's Manufacturer Serial Number (MSN), the section currently being produced and the purchase customer.

In this case, we're looking at 'section 18' of what will be the 186th A380 ordered from Airbus, destined for Emirates:

MSN186 will eventually be registered as A6-EOL and will enter service as Emirates' 64th superjumbo.

The A380 components assembled here in Hamburg are shipped to the final assembly line in Toulouse on a specially-built roll-on, roll-off ship.

That's where the giant bird truly gets its wings – and its tail, which is pre-painted before being connected to the fuselage.

After attaching the engines and doing a final test, aircraft are then flown back to Hamburg for a proper paint job.

That's done in the 'Lackierhalle', which translates literally as the ""paint shop"". We're allowed inside for a sneak peek, but as the full process is commercially sensitive and normally done behind closed doors, cameras are left behind.

Superjumbos emerge between 10 and 15 days later, covered in approximately 650kg of paint and looking much as you'd see at any airport terminal.

All that's left is to fit out the A380's double-deck interior – including the passenger seats, cabin walls and overhead lockers – before the aircraft is ready for delivery to the purchasing airline.

Once that happens, it's like any other bird in the sky: ready to take paying passengers on the holiday of a lifetime, on their next business trip or even just across the ditch to Auckland for a weekend away.

This two-minute video captures the entire process from start to finish – produced by Emirates during contruction of the airline's 50th superjumbo:

Would be a shame if Avro replacement proj is delayed: Airbus - DNA India,"Fri, 20 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRuYWluZGlhLmNvbS9pbmRpYS9yZXBvcnQtd291bGQtYmUtYS1zaGFtZS1pZi1hdnJvLXJlcGxhY2VtZW50LXByb2otaXMtZGVsYXllZC1haXJidXMtMjA2MjY2MdIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRuYWluZGlhLmNvbS9pbmRpYS9yZXBvcnQtd291bGQtYmUtYS1zaGFtZS1pZi1hdnJvLXJlcGxhY2VtZW50LXByb2otaXMtZGVsYXllZC1haXJidXMtMjA2MjY2MS9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Would be a shame if Avro replacement proj is delayed: Airbus

With no decision in sight yet over the Airbus-Tata consortium's bid to replace IAF's ageing fleet of 56 Avro aircraft with C-295 transport carriers, the European aviation major today said it would be a ""shame"" if the project is delayed further.

With no decision in sight yet over the Airbus-Tata consortium's bid to replace IAF's ageing fleet of 56 Avro aircraft with C-295 transport carriers, the European aviation major today said it would be a ""shame"" if the project is delayed further.

Terming the bid of C-295 as an ""elegant opportunity"" for the government's push for 'Make in India', Airbus said they cannot be faulted for being the only bidder.

""It is a very elegant opportunity to move forward with Make in India and it would really a shame if we delay it for any reason precisely at a time when that is so high on nation's agenda,"" Kieran Daly, spokesperson of Airbus' Military aircraft, told PTI.

He was replying to a question if the delay works against the concept of 'Make in India'.

Daly said he understands that there is a discussion about moving ahead when Airbus-TATA are effectively the sole bidder.

""We understand the concern about that but we have pointed out that although we are the sole bidder now, we were not the sole candidate at the beginning. There were other aircraft in that class. The fact that other companies did not chose to be in, we cannot be faulted for that,"" he said.

The senior Airbus official said the company had ""enormously incentivised"" to be competitive, because at the time when they submitted the bid, the company did not think they would become the sole bidder.

""So it has been very competitive from day one,"" he said, adding that Airbus wants India as a strategic market and partner for years to come.

In May 2013, the Ministry had issued a global tender -- called a Request For Proposals (RFP) -- to original equipment manufacturers including US firms Boeing and Lockheed Martin, European multinational Airbus Defence and Space, and Antonov of Ukraine among others.

They were required to tie-up with an Indian private company under which 40 aircraft will be produced here while 16 will be bought off-the-shelf.

However, only a single bidder -- Airbus Defence and Space and Tata Advanced Systems Ltd (TASL) consortium -- had bid for the proposal in October last year.

Under the current defence procurement policy, single- vendor situation is not entertained unless cleared by the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC).

A decision to this effect was expected to be taken by the Ministry in November last but was delayed as Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar had sought more information.

The defence sources said a decision could be taken soon.

One of the options, besides selecting the consortium, is to go in for re-tendering in which the Indian companies become the main player rather than the foreign ones.

Another option is putting the project on hold and go ahead with the joint development and production of 'Multi-role Transport Aircraft' with Russia, defence analysts said.

Asked about the possibility of retendering, Daly said, ""We are not going to tell India how to run its procurements.

If that was the solution, then so be it. We are comfortable that C-295 is the ideal for replacing the Avro.

He said the aircraft last year had 85 per cent market share."
"Sit, Stand Or Lean: What's The Future Of Airline Travel? - Gulf Business","Sat, 07 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vZ3VsZmJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9zaXQtc3RhbmQtbGVhbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Passengers in business and first class have arguably enjoyed the biggest overhaul in aircraft seating in recent years. Fully flat bed designs, and now three-room suites in the case of Etihad, are bringing new levels of comfort and space to high paying flyers.

But in economy, with the exception of new entertainment systems, and perhaps better cushions and headrests, the passenger experience has largely remained the same, and could be worsening, according to reports.

This lack of innovation has not gone unnoticed among airlines. Plane manufacturers and designers have all presented their ideas for the future of economy seating in recent years, although many reflect where airline priorities lie when it comes to lower cost flying.

THE SEAT WIDTH DEBATE

If economy passengers have noticed their seats seeming smaller than before on long haul routes it may not just be from one too many snacks before take off.

A report last year by the Wall Street Journal found that big carriers including American Airlines, Air Canada, Air France-KLM and Emirates were bringing the short haul standard seat width to long-haul flying by cramming an extra seat into each row.

For almost 20 years, the standard setup of the Boeing 777 was nine seats per row, but 70 per cent of Boeing’s biggest version of the plane delivered in 2012 included 10 abreast seating, up from just 15 per cent in 2010, the report found.

Meanwhile, 90 per cent of airlines that bought the 787 Dreamliner selected nine-abreast seating in economy over eight-abreast.

Planes from rival Airbus were also not immune, with 10 airlines found to fly Airbus A330 jetliners with nine 16.7-inch width seats in each row, rather than the eight it was designed for.

This trends reverses decades of seat width growth in economy, and could be a sign of where the industry is heading, at least in the short term.

The standard seat width for long haul flying increased to 18 inches in the 1970s and 80s with the 747 jumbo and first Airbus planes, jumping to 18.5 inches in the Boeing 777 and A380 superjumbo.

In comparison cost-conscious airlines today are offering, 17-inch wide seats on their Boeing 777 and 787 Dreamliners and 18-inch wide seats on their A350s.

This difference has led to some sabre rattling between the manufacturers, with Airbus even going as far as commissioning a study at the end of last year from the London Sleep Centre, as part of its call for airlines to set a minimum 18-inch seat width standard for long haul flights.

“With longer flights and higher load factors today, one more inch of seat width makes a real difference. The extra inch makes the difference between sitting comfortably and physical contact between neighbours,” says Suzana Hrnkova, head of aircraft interiors marketing at Airbus.

The research conducted by having six healthy adults complete a series of “night sleeps in flight simulations re-creating [the] long-haul economy passenger experience” with all variables kept constant except seat width, which was changed from 17 to 18 inches.

The wider seats were found to improve sleep quality variables by up to 53 per cent, with Airbus stating it maintained a standard 18-inch minimum seat width in its long-haul economy cabins.

“We are however seeing a trend that especially on full service long haul, new generation jets from the competition have smaller seats in economy,” says Hmkova.

In contrast, rival Boeing is quick to point out that the ball is in airlines’ court in deciding how much comfort to offer passengers.

“We design our interiors to give our airline customers the flexibility to offer their passengers the right combination of comfort and value,” says Marty Bentrott, vice president – sales, Boeing Commercial Aeroplanes for Middle East, Russia and Central Asia.

“Our customers have the flexibility to offer passengers a great experience in a way that makes economic sense for the airline and economic sense for the passenger.”

Debates aside, reserving the right level of comfort while maximising airline revenue is the ideal combination, for airline seating, according to Airbus’ Hmkova.

Bearing this in mind there have been a series of radical designs proposed by the manufacturer in recent announcements and patent filings.“Whilst many patents are filed each year, not all come to fruition.

This is common for innovative companies, although of course we hope these innovations are implemented and do become the norm,” she says.

BICYCLE SEATS

In December 2013 Airbus filed a patent application for a seat design resembling a bicycle seat mixed with an office chair, with a small back rest, two small arm rests, and the ability to fold up and down when not in use like cinema or stadium seats.

The design would position the passenger in a semi upright stance, reducing the required legroom between rows at the expense of some passenger comfort, the manufacturer admitted.

“However, this reduced comfort is tolerable for passengers in as much as the flight lasts one or a few hours,” the airline said.

THE CIRCLE

Another patent filed in April 2014 proposed an arguably even more radical seating scheme, doing away with seat rows altogether in a circular design described by the Financial Times as a “flying doughnut.”

In the application, Airbus says that traditional aeroplanes, where passengers sit in rows in tube like structure, have a design flaw, in that a lot of stress is placed on the front and back when the cabin is pressurised.

This requires reinforced frames, which reduce the number of passengers airlines can fit in.

The manufacturer theorises that the redistributed pressure with a circular cabin in an aeroplane design that resembles a stealth bomber, would allow airlines to fit even more paying passengers on the aircraft. Some reports however theorised that sitting in a different direction to the one the plane was moving could cause motion sickness for some passengers.

ConCept 2050

Airbus has also shared its vision for how aircraft cabin and aircraft designs might radically change in the longer term.

Driven by the philosophy “inspired by nature” the concept cabin is based on bionic principles to deliver aircraft cabins optimised to the needs of individual passengers, according to Airbus.

Technologies envisioned for the concept include fittings and furnishings able to clean and repair themselves thanks to self-healing covers and dirt repellent coatings, while traditional travel classes would no longer apply.

“First, Business and Economy class are replaced by zones that target more individual needs like relaxing, playing games, interacting with other passengers or holding business meetings with people on the ground,” says Hmkova.

A video of the cabin vision shows a young woman walking through a plane with sections of traditional seating rows, leather sofas and armchairs and even sun loungers in a cabin with transparent walls and roof.

Another area shows a glass bottom boat style viewing deck with bench seating, and private rooms that can be customised to include a desk with chair, bed, or lounger with coffee table.

Although it is likely to take more than 35 years for passengers to be able to drive or fly out of the open front of the plane in their cars when they reach the gate, as the video suggests.

“By offering different levels of experience within each zone, airlines would be able to achieve the price differential they need to operate a successful business, give more people access to the benefits of air travel and still look after the environment, adds Hmkova.

Leaning posts or Just stand?

Suggestions from other sources appear more feasible today, although less comfortable for the passenger.

In 2010 Irish budget airline Ryanair proposed vertical seats, resembling leaning posts with seatbelts attached on flights of up to one hour, including its London to Dublin route.

The airline proposed removing five rows of conventional seats and two rear toilets at the back of its conventional 737s and replacing them with 10 rows of standing passengers.

It was reported at the time that some of these posts would be available for free, net of taxes and airport charges, while others could cost up to 10 euros.

However, amid warnings from safety regulators the plans never got off the ground.

Two years later Ryanair was at it again, proposing cabins with a standing room only section and handles instead of seatbelts.

“You don’t need a seat belt on the London Underground,” Michael O’Leary reasoned to UK daily the Telegraph in late 2012.

“You don’t need a seat belt on trains which are traveling at 120 mph.” Although his descriptions of an

aeroplane as “just a bloody bus with wings” and exclamation that “if there ever was a crash on an aircraft, God forbid, a seat belt won’t save you,” may have made aircraft safety regulators wince.

However, despite conjuring headlines every time Ryanair mentions the standing concept, little progress towards making it a reality seems to have been made.

sLeeping pods

A more comfortable concept from London-based firm Factorydesign, which was commissioned by Zodiac seats, is the Air Lair, featuring single seat cocoons stacked on top of each other.

The design features moveable seats than can be positioned to lie flat or upright with each pod boasting mood lighting on the ceiling, a projector to screen films and an iPod dock.

It was claimed the design would give passengers 30 per cent more room than traditional aircraft seats and provide more privacy. Although Factorydesign director Adam White admitted that the pods might present difficulties for disabled passengers.

Only time will tell which of these designs becomes a reality, although if recent trends are anything to go by it could be – the smaller the seat, the better for many airlines."

Iberia's bidding for upgrades... how does it work? - Economy Class & Beyond - Kevin Marshall,"Wed, 11 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vZWNvbm9teWNsYXNzYW5kYmV5b25kLmJvYXJkaW5nYXJlYS5jb20vMjAxNS8wMi8xMS9pYmVyaWFzLWJpZGRpbmctZm9yLXVwZ3JhZGVzLWhvdy1kb2VzLWl0LXdvcmsv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In the near future, I have in my life a segment on Iberia.



Iberia Airbus A320 taxing at Barcelona Airport – Image, Economy Class and Beyond.

Well – it was a good idea at the time. Sadly, I won’t be aboard this little Airbus A320, but aboard an A330 for a transatlantic hop.

However, going through Iberia’s Manage My Booking took, I found something rather interesting – that I could bid for an upgrade:

Whereas British Airways (Iberia’s sister airline) offers Proactive Online UpGrade’s (POUG), Iberia seems to want to have competition of bidding for an upgrade. In this case, bidding for an upgrade between Madrid and Chicago O’Hare International.

So, €450 sounds great for a business class seat doesn’t it? Hold your horses. It’s a bidding game, not a buying game. In the case of my Madrid to Chicago flight, so the prices varies – as does the “intensity” of the bid. Here’s examples from my flight:

For €450, not very “intense” bidding

€525 gives a bit more of an intensity in the bidding war – but not that much…

More money = more chance it seems with four hammers selected and the price jumping to €675.

Near enough full price with a single segment up to €900.

Note that the bids are per segment only. Bidding is per segment too. If you choose to take part in the bidding war, you can change your bid up to five days before you fly.

You find out if your bid was accepted four days before you fly.

And annoyingly, no bonus Avios or tier points as it seems to be related to your base fare according to a FlyerTalk thread.

Iberia has a FAQ here.

For those who want to bid on the cheap for a nicer seat on Iberia as well as gain access to business class facilities on the ground including lounge access, priority luggage and fast track lanes. In the air, it will be the business class product appropriate to the service.

For me €450 isn’t what I’d call bad. Considering a business class upgrade on United on a similar length segment was near enough €675 in the past – there is a lot of room here in the bidding war.

How confident you feel when you place a bid – like any auction – is the important thing. If you go in expecting to get a business class seat and fail to get an upgrade… you might be disappointed…

Airbus highlights A350's ETOPS abilities – Australian Aviation - Australian Aviation,"Thu, 26 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vYXVzdHJhbGlhbmF2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS5hdS8yMDE1LzAyL2FpcmJ1cy1oaWdobGlnaHRzLWEzNTBzLWV0b3BzLWFiaWxpdGllcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus says its A350-900 can fly virtually unrestricted from any two cities in the world with 370-minute extended twin-engine operation approval (ETOPS) – so it’s no longer seeking the 420-minute ETOPS for which it originally applied.

When the European Aviation Safety Agency certified the A350-900 on September 30 2014, it allowed the aircraft to fly up to six hours and 10 minutes away from a potential diversion airport in the event of a single engine failure.

It was the first aircraft to receive ETOPS approval for more than 180 minutes at the time of certification.

Airbus A350 marketing director Mike Bausor says the manufacturer is no longer seeking the 420-minute ETOPS with the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) during the certification phase: “We don’t need 420 minutes. There is nowhere we can’t go with 370 minutes,” Bausor said at the Avalon Airshow on Wednesday.

“When we filed with the FAA originally, we filed for 420 minutes. It turns out that was right at the beginning when we first designed the aircraft and now with 370 minutes we don’t need to go any further.”

In an Australian context, ETOPS restrictions are particularly relevant on routes across the southern oceans, such as Australia to South America and Australia to South Africa. Qantas flies a four-engine Boeing 747-400 to Johannesburg and Santiago from its Sydney hub.

Meanwhile, the Flying Kangaroo’s Oneworld Alliance partner LAN uses a four-engine Airbus A340-300 on its daily Santiago to Sydney service, which makes a technical stop in Auckland on both directions.

Bausor says: “By having 370 minutes you have actually eliminated any ETOPS constraints on routing. You can fly anywhere in the world except for overflying Antarctica,which is no-fly zone.”

LAN is due to switch to a Boeing 787 Dreamliner on the route from late April.

And Qatar Airways took delivery of its first A350 on December 22 2014.

The first commercial flight took place on January 15 2015, when Qatar flew the aircraft from its Doha hub to Frankfurt.

Bausor adds that Qatar is due to take the first seven A350 aircraft to be delivered, with Vietnam Airlines expected to receive its first A350 sometime in the middle of 2015.

Helsinki-based Finnair is the third airline due to take the A350 into commercial service before the end of 2015.

He explains: “The second customer is not the second aeroplane to be delivered. There is a whole batch of aircraft being delivered to Qatar Airways before Vietnam get their first one.

“The thing about Qatar is that it’s a very demanding customer. If we can deliver to Qatar then I think it’s really reflects on how mature the aeroplane is.”

The A350 program has had 780 orders from 40 customers since the program was launched in December 2006.

Bausor says Airbus plans to deliver 15 A350s in 2015 with production rates to rise to 10 a month by 2018.

With the A350-900 already in service, he says attention will turn to the development of the stretched A350-1000. Final assembly on the first A350-1000 is due to begin at the start of 2016, with entry-into-service in mid-2017.

Meanwhile, the 97,000lb thrust Trent XWB engines are expected to be run on Airbus’s A380 flying test bed in October.

While one-third of all A350 orders have been placed by carriers in the Asia-Pacific, an airline in Oceania is not among them. But Bausor expects the A350 to be a regular feature over Australian skies.

He stresses: “The A350 has been built, it is a long-range aeroplane and if there is one destination which is the long-range destination it has got to be Australia. In another three or four years I am sure there will be many A350s coming to Australia.”"
Indian companies becoming single source suppliers to global OEMs | Mint - Mint,"Wed, 18 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9Db21wYW5pZXMvanE5Z05RazJFd0VPOUc0dHZrZ2VaSi9JbmRpYW4tY29tcGFuaWVzLWJlY29taW5nLXNpbmdsZS1zb3VyY2Utc3VwcGxpZXJzLXRvLWdsb2JhbC5odG1s0gGEAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9Db21wYW5pZXMvanE5Z05RazJFd0VPOUc0dHZrZ2VaSi9JbmRpYW4tY29tcGFuaWVzLWJlY29taW5nLXNpbmdsZS1zb3VyY2Utc3VwcGxpZXJzLXRvLWdsb2JhbC5odG1sP2ZhY2V0PWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Mumbai: “If a truck break downs between our Belgaum manufacturing facility and Bengaluru International Airport, there will be an impact on a final product of a plane made in Europe,"" says Walt Sirmans, president at the aerospace unit of Aequs Pvt. Ltd , a Karnataka-based aerospace components manufacturer.

Sirmans is right as Aequs’ aerospace unit has become the sole source for several machining material for Premium Aerotech GmbH, an aerospace manufacturing business, headquartered in Augsburg in Germany. Premium Aerotech is a subsidiary of Airbus Group.

Aequs is one among many Indian companies becoming single sources for global original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, such as Airbus SAS of Toulouse and Boeing Co. of the US.

Tata Advance Systems Ltd (TASL), Dynamatic Technologies Ltd, Jupiter Aviation and Logistics Pvt. Ltd are among many companies that are becoming single source suppliers to OEMs.

The Narendra Modi government, after coming to power, has launched an ambitious programme to make India a manufacturing powerhouse and has advocated boosting exports and substituting imports with products manufactured domestically.

Aequs’ Sirmans said the company secured a multi-year deal worth more than $50 million from Premium Aerotech to supply materials including aluminium machining for Airbus planes such as the popular narrow body A320s, widebodied A330s and A380s, the world’s largest civilian planes.

“We will be single source manufacturers to Premium Aerotech. The deal is for seven years. It will give a revenue visibility of $8 million every year starting 2016. This project will also create 200 more jobs in India,"" said Aequs chairman and chief executive Aravind Melligeri.

Melligeri said there are more Indian companies turning themselves into single source suppliers to big OEMs.

Aequs is also in process of acquiring a French company with a $4 million revenue and a US company that has revenue of $10 million.

“We will be closing both deals by the end of this financial year. These acquisitions will compliment Indian capabilities. The French company is focusing on landing gear components while the US company is into aerostructures,"" Melligeri added.

On Monday, Airbus said it has signed an agreement with Bengaluru-based Dynamatic Technologies to be the single source supplier of flap-track beams for the wide body A330 family aircraft. The agreement is the largest manufacturing contract between Airbus and a private sector company in India and elevates Dynamatic to a global tier-1 supplier.

Dynamatic has manufactured flap-track beam assemblies for Airbus’ single-aisle A320 family on a global single source basis as a Tier-2 supplier, since 2010.

The flaps on the wings, which are instrumental in controlling the speed, direction and balance of the aircraft, move along high-tech guide rails known as flap track beams.

These flap track beams are so-called Class 1 flight critical assemblies that are connected to the wings. Dynamatic will supply four out of five flap track beams used on every A330 aircraft wing.

Tata Group controlled TASL is the global single source for assembly of helicopter fuselage for Sikorsky S-92 helicopters and wire harness installation.

Sikorsky Corp is a US-based helicopter manufacturer. TASL will deliver the 95th cabin to Sikorsky by March, 2015.

TASL is also a global single source designated for assembly of Empennage for military transport aircraft (Lockheed Martin C 130J) and assembly of center wing box structures.

Others are also ramping up their supportive facilities as more Indian companies are turning single source suppliers to OEMs.

On Tuesday, aerospace materials and logistics provider ThyssenKrupp Aerospace, part of ThyssenKrupp AG, will set up a storage facility in Bengaluru, according to Jurgen Funke, chief executive officer of the company.

The facility will have processing capabilities and offer supply chain management to tier I and tier 2 suppliers of OEMs besides offering cut-to-size and machine-ready material that is shipped to the customer just in time.

“The lead time, that is time taken to place the order for materials and receiving the same, is six months for aerospace materials in certain cases. And the cost of keeping such material accounts to 30-40% for a Tier 1 or Tier 2 supplier. This proposed facility will cut the time and cost,"" Gopi Hanumanthappa, managing director at ThyssenKrupp Aerospace India Pvt. Ltd had said on Tuesday.

He said content produced in India in terms of aerospace is growing.

Plane maker Boeing Co. is also tying up with Indian companies to source components from India.

General Electric Co. (GE) of the US is also setting up a multi-modular manufacturing facility in Pune envisaging an investment of $200 million. Key parts of all types of aircraft engines are going to be built from this facility.

Small arms detection for MILDS - Australian Defence Magazine,"Thu, 26 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5kZWZlbmNlLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL3NtYWxsLWFybXMtZGV0ZWN0aW9uLWZvci1taWxkc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Philip Smart | Avalon Airshow

The Airbus MILDS missile approach warning system used on Australia’s Tiger and MRH90 helicopters can now also detect small arms fire, thanks to a joint project between Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) and Airbus Defence and Space.

The MILDS AN/AAR-60 Block II system uses four to five uncooled ultra violet sensors to detect missile exhaust plumes, tracking up to eight targets simultaneously.

Through a software application the Airbus/DSTO team has now added the small arms Hostile Fire Indication (HFI) ability, with the algorithms tested successfully in field trials.

The modification is software only, with no additional equipment needed.

Airbus says the system’s extremely high resolution and rapid processing enable reliable threat identification and virtually eliminate false alarms.

Operating the UV spectrum sidesteps the limitations of other warning technologies such as infra red.

With more than 8,000 sensors sold, Airbus describes MILDS as “the standard missile approach warning system outside the United States.”

It is in service aboard rotary wing and wide-body aircraft, including Tiger, NH90, CH-53, CH-47 and MI-17 helicopters and C-130 transport aircraft.

A specific fighter version – MILDS F – is in service with the Royal Danish Airforce and Royal Norwegian Airforce F-16 fighters."

Published 25th Feb 2015



Emirates may consider introducing the world's largest passenger plane for flights from a Scottish airport if conditions are right''.

Emirates UK vice president Laurie Berryman said there are no firm plans'' to bring in the Airbus A380 at Glasgow Airport but it could be considered as an option for expansion.

Another option could be introducing a third daily flight between Glasgow and Dubai, which currently has a service twice a day.

An Airbus A380 landed at Glasgow Airport last April as Emirates marked its 10th anniversary of flights from Scotland.

It usually carries 525 passengers with seats in economy, business and first class, but can carry more than 850 passengers when flying with only economy seats.

Mr Berryman said: We have no firm plans but if conditions are right we will look to the A380, but it is quite a big step up in capacity.''

He added: The debate will be whether the next stage of expansion will be an A380 or a third flight.

There's always airport facilities to consider as you need at least two or three bridges to service the A380 properly.''

He said they would also have to consider whether they could fill the aircraft in the quieter seasons.

Emirates started flying from Glasgow in 2004 and it is an absolutely vital'' part of the airline's UK strategy, Mr Berryman said.

Dubai is the most popular destination for people flying from Scotland, followed by Australia, Pakistan, Thailand, Malaysia and places in the Indian Ocean.

As well as rising passenger numbers, the airline has seen a huge increase in cargo, which has grown by more than 1,000% since 2004.

Its aircraft carry one million kilos of cargo out of Glasgow in an average month.

Large amounts of Scotch whisky are flown to the Far East while the airline also transports lots of oil drilling equipment.

In the last five years there has been an increase in the amount of fresh seafood such as scallops, razor clams and salmon which is transported as cargo."
SAA seeks to renegotiate Airbus deal – again - Creamer Media's Engineering News,"Mon, 16 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lbmdpbmVlcmluZ25ld3MuY28uemEvYXJ0aWNsZS9zYWEtc2Vla3MtdG8tcmVuZWdvdGlhdGUtYWlyYnVzLWRlYWwtYWdhaW4tMjAxNS0wMi0xNtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"National flag carrier South African Airways (SAA) is in an advanced stage of renegotiating its deal with European airliner manufacturer Airbus to acquire A320 single-aisle (or narrow body) aircraft. The aim is to replace ten of the aircraft still on order with five A330 wide-body airliners. This was revealed on Monday by SAA acting CEO Nico Bezuidenhout. He was addressing the media at a function at SAA head office at O R Tambo International Airport, east of Johannesburg.

SAA originally ordered 15 Airbus A320s during 2002. This order was meant to have been cancelled in 2004, but it turned out that Transnet, then SAA’s shareholder, failed to follow the legal processes required to cancel the deal, leaving the contract in force, with the result that Airbus continued to build the aircraft. Only in 2008 did SAA find out that the contract was still legally valid and in force, when Airbus asked the airline to accept delivery of the first A320.

Furthermore, the airline discovered that the contract required it to pay a premium over the basic (list?) price of the aircraft, which required SAA to take an impairment on its accounts for each brand new airliner. This impairment has varied from R5-million to R10-million on the aircraft that were delivered.

Bezuidenhout pointed out that the airline had to renegotiate the deal. Airbus was willing to do so, if SAA increased the order to 20 A320s. This was agreed. So far, ten of the aircraft have been delivered. “It’s a great aircraft,” he said. “But its not been great financially [for SAA].”

Now, against the background of the current 90 Day Action Plan and the Long Term Turnaround Strategy, and with changes in SAA’s route network and market priorities, the airline has sought to restructure the deal again. “We’ve engaged with Airbus on this,” he stated. “We’ve not concluded the transaction, but it's likely we’ll not take delivery of the last ten [A320s] but get five A330s .... the premium we paid, disappears.”

SAA already operates six A330-200 airliners. “They are the only fuel efficient wide-bodies that we have,” he pointed out (although the drop in the fuel price has significantly improved the operating economics of the airline’s four-engined Airbus A340s, with the result that their replacement is no longer urgent). “The A330 works for our network, especially in Africa.” (SAA is planning to increase its operations to and from the rest of Africa.)

The new aircraft would be leased, either from a specialist leasing company or direct from Airbus itself. They would be a mixture of A330-200s and A330-300s (currently, SAA operates only the -200 version) and deliveries would start in late 2016 and continue through 2017."

UK's first A400M aircraft named “City of Bristol” - GOV.UK,"Mon, 09 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdvdi51ay9nb3Zlcm5tZW50L25ld3MvdWtzLWZpcnN0LWE0MDBtLWFpcmNyYWZ0LW5hbWVkLWNpdHktb2YtYnJpc3RvbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The UK’s first A400M Atlas has been named “City of Bristol” by the Royal Air Force in a rare honour to highlight the important role industry in the city has played in the delivery of the aircraft.

The wings of the next-generation military transporter plane were designed and manufactured at the Airbus factory in Filton, Bristol, with a number of other businesses in the city, including Rolls-Royce, GKN Aerospace, and Atkins, demonstrating a range of high quality aerospace skills which support the A400M programme.

A total of 22 A400M Atlas aircraft have been ordered by the Ministry of Defence’s procurement arm, Defence, Equipment and Support (DE&S), which is also based in the city at Abbey Wood.

A400M Altas 'City of Bristol' facts and figures

The naming of the aircraft is a special privilege for Bristol, since it is unusual for the RAF to name an individual aircraft in this way.

Speaking at a ceremony at the Airbus site to mark the event, Defence Minister Philip Dunne said:

The A400M programme has created or secured work for around 900 people at companies based here in Bristol and is providing skilled jobs in manufacturing, engineering and supply chain roles. Many of these jobs require training to acquire specialist new skills needed to help keep the UK aerospace sector at the forefront of this high technology industry. The MOD is playing its part in contributing to our long-term economic plan and this A400M programme will become an important contributor to the defence supply chain, here in Bristol, for years to come.

To mark the honour, the “City of Bristol” A400M Atlas recently completed a fly-past of the Clifton Suspension Bridge which also served as a reminder of the engineering history of the city.

Chief of Materiel Air, Air Marshal Simon Bollom said:

The naming of the Royal Air Force’s first A400M aircraft as City of Bristol reflects a continuation of historical ties between Bristol and the Royal Air Force. Bristol is at the heart of the UK aerospace community which has progressed through time and industry from the Bristol built engines like Jupiter - the most successful aero engine of the 1920s - through to famous jets such as Concorde. This tradition continues with state of the art work being carried out at Airbus’s Filton site on wings for the A400M, supported by complex work packages from GKN, Rolls-Royce and Atkins and this rare naming honour is recognition for the long and entrenched affiliation between the City of Bristol and British aviation.

Manufactured by Airbus Defence & Space the A400M Atlas will replace the existing fleet of C-130 Hercules and represents major advances on its predecessor, with it capable of flying considerably faster, twice as far and able to carry almost twice as much cargo."

Wind farms could compromise safety at Hawarden Airport by creating ‘false’ aircraft reports and desensitising radar equipment.

Aerospace giant Airbus is concerned that existing and proposed turbines in the area could have a detrimental affect on the airport, which it owns and runs.

To combat that risk the plane maker wants to build a new ‘in-fill’ radar which will help cut out interference from the turbines.

They did not specify which wind farms could potentially affect the airport but guidance from the Civil Aviation Authority said wind farms within 30km of a aerodrome and radar could have an impact on operations.

'Pro-active' move from Airbus

A spokesman said: “The proposed development is part of a pro-active move on behalf of Airbus to ensure that the operational efficiency of the site as a functioning airport is not compromised by the potential adverse effects of proximate existing and future wind farm developments.

“Wind turbines have been shown to have detrimental effects on the performance of conventional primary surveillance radar.

“These effects include the desensitisation of radar in the vicinity of the turbines and the creation of 'false' aircraft returns which air traffic controllers must treat as real in certain circumstances.

“The desensitisation of radar could result in aircraft not being detected by the radar and therefore not presented to air traffic controllers.

“As a consequence, the existing radar system in operation at the Airbus site is proposed to be supplemented with an in-fill radar, which would be tolerant of existing and future wind farm developments.”

The proposed development comprises the erection of a 25 metre high radar mast in order to facilitate the safe operation of Hawarden Airport.

The airport is used by Airbus to transport wings on Beluga aircraft and also to transfer workers to other sites.

There are also chartered private flights from the airstrip but proposals for public scheduled flights were dropped last year."
Aero India 2015: Airbus in Talks with Indian Firms to Manufacture Helicopters Locally - IBTimes India,"Fri, 20 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlidGltZXMuY28uaW4vYWVyby1pbmRpYS0yMDE1LWFpcmJ1cy10YWxraW5nLWluZGlhbi1maXJtcy1tYW51ZmFjdHVyZS1oZWxpY29wdGVycy1sb2NhbGx5LTYyNDA2N9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters said it is in consultations with Indian conglomerates – Tatas, Mahindra and Mahindra and Reliance Industries, to jointly manufacture military helicopters.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""Make in India"" initiative envisages foreign arms makers to form partnership with Indian companies to enable local manufacturing of arms, to reduce imports.

Airbus Helicopters

The subsidiary of the Airbus Group is offering to build its light utility AS550 Fennec and the medium lift EC725 in India, to replace India's ageing Cheetah and Chetak helicopters.

""We are in the selection process, talking to different industries to form a JV (joint venture),"" Rainer Farid, a senior Airbus Helicopters executive told Reuters on Friday at Aero India 2015 in Bengaluru.

In 2014, India decided to scrap the earlier proposal to acquire 197 light utility helicopters in order to allow local companies to join international majors and build the helicopters within India through joint ventures.

Russian helicopter manufacturers and US-based Sikorsky are also expected to bid for the order.

Currently, state-run Hindustan Aeronautics, based in Bangalore is the only Indian producer of helicopters, meaning global defence firms will have to find partners with Indian conglomerates who have ventured into the arena, with the opening of the sector a little more than a decade ago.

However, Farid, who was speaking on the sidelines of the ongoing Aero India 2015, noted that the task of establishing necessary vendor units in India was going to be tough, given that such vendors don't exist as of now.

The Narendra Modi government has increased foreign direct investment in the defence sector up to 49%, in the belief that more international firms would be willing to tie up and start producing locally.

On Wednesday, India's Bharat Forge announced its joint venture with Israel's Rafael Advanced Defence Systems to produce the Spike anti-tank guided missile."

An exhibition of photographs marking 75 years of aerospace in Broughton has embarked on a public tour.

Now the centre of wing production for the entire range of Airbus commercial aircraft, the first factory at Broughton officially opened in September 1939 and has built a range of classic aircraft including the Wellington, Comet and the HS-125 business jet.

The exhibition opened today at Blacon Library in Chester.

Kath Hayes, community relations manager at Airbus said: “This is such an exciting time for the Broughton plant, celebrating this momentous 75th milestone. In addition to the many activities taking place for our employees we felt it was fitting to involve our community in this celebration, many of whom will remember the memories included in our photo exhibition”.

Blacon Cllr Reggie Jones added: “I am delighted and proud to support the 75th Anniversary of the Broughton facility. From its early days at the start of the Second World War producing Wellingtons up to today’s production of wings for a wide range of passenger aircraft, Broughton has always been at the forefront of innovation and passenger safety.

“Airbus’ skilled workforce has grown from strength to strength and has a well-deserved reputation as a world class manufacturer of wings. Airbus is also very conscious of its social responsibilities and this ethos encourages employees to volunteer, fundraise and work with partners to improve the health and wellbeing of its surrounding communities.”

The photo exhibition will be on display at Blacon library, Western Avenue, Blacon, CH1 5QY, from now until February 20. Further dates and venues will be announced in due course."
