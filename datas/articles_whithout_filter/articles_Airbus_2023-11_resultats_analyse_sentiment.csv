Airbus and Voyager sign agreement with ESA on Starlab commercial space station - SpaceNews,"Thu, 09 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXJidXMtYW5kLXZveWFnZXItc2lnbi1hZ3JlZW1lbnQtd2l0aC1lc2Etb24tc3RhcmxhYi1jb21tZXJjaWFsLXNwYWNlLXN0YXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CEDAR PARK, Texas — The European Space Agency has signed an agreement with Airbus and Voyager Space to study potential use of the companies’ Starlab commercial space station as a successor to the International Space Station.

Airbus and Voyager said Nov. 9 they signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with ESA during the European Space Summit in Seville, Spain, earlier in the week. (Dylan Taylor, chairman and chief executive of Voyager Space, is the vice chairman and a shareholder of Multiverse Media Inc., the parent company of SpaceNews.)

The two companies and ESA will initially study how the planned Starlab space station can be used to provide continued access to space for Europe after the retirement of the ISS. That utilization could include ESA astronaut missions to Starlab and use of the station for ESA-supported research.

ESA could also provide cargo and crew transportation for Starlab, the companies added. The agency is starting a commercial cargo initiative it announced at the summit Nov. 6 that seeks to have a vehicle ready for missions by 2028. That cargo vehicle could later evolve into a crewed vehicle.

“ESA appreciates the transatlantic industry initiative for the commercial Starlab space station, and the potential that its strong European footprint holds for significant European industrial and institutional contributions to, and use of, said station,” ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher said in a statement.

Both commercial space station developers and ISS partner nations have been determining how best to enable those partners to use commercial stations after the retirement of the ISS, currently scheduled for 2030. The current approach among ISS partners for bartering services is not expected to extend to commercial stations, requiring new contracts or other partnerships.

“This agreement with the European Space Agency is critical as we continue to foster international collaboration in the space domain and move towards succeeding the International Space Station with Starlab,” Matthew Kuta, president of Voygaer Space, said in the statement. “We look forward to working with Airbus and ESA to extend Europe’s footprint in space and ensure they remain a leader in the new generation of commercial space exploration.”

Voyager previously took a step towards enabling European access when it announced in August a joint venture with Airbus to develop Starlab. Having Airbus involved helps not only with the technical development of Starlab, Kuta said at the time, but also its business development. “We have great relationships with ESA, but clearly Airbus has much better relationships,” he said then.

“Our collaboration on this next-generation space station builds on a long and successful partnership between ESA and Airbus in developing and operating a wide range of crewed and uncrewed spacecraft,” Mike Schoellhorn, chief executive of Airbus Defence and Space, said in a statement.

Besides the joint venture with Airbus, Voyager Space announced in October a partnership with Northrop Grumman, which had been developing its own commercial space station. Northrop will offer a version of its Cygnus cargo spacecraft able to dock autonomously with Starlab, along with other potential contributions.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999672174453735}",neutral,0.9999672174453735,0

Long-haul carrier Emirates signals it will hold off on major Airbus purchase over engine worries - The Associated Press,"Tue, 14 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2R1YmFpLWFpci1zaG93LWJvZWluZy1haXJidXMtcm9sbHMtcm95Y2UtYTkzZWQxNTA2Y2MyZTczZDczZjBiODIyMzBiZTliMjbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Long-haul carrier Emirates signaled Tuesday it will hold off on a major purchase of Airbus A350 aircraft over concerns about their Rolls Royce engines, marking a major blow for the European manufacturer during the Dubai Air Show.

Emirates President Tim Clark’s comments to journalists at the show came the day after his airline announced a $52 billion purchase with Airbus’ rival Boeing Co., while its sister airline FlyDubai bought another $11 billion of aircraft from Boeing.

Meanwhile, Ethiopian Airlines said it was buying 31 aircraft from Boeing, including 20 737 MAX aircraft in a sign of renewed confidence in the single-aisle aircraft by the carrier after it suffered a deadly crash in 2019 with the airplane that led to its worldwide grounding.

Airbus has yet to strike a major deal at the show, which comes as global airlines like Emirates have bounced back from the lockdowns of the coronavirus pandemic with increased global demand for travel.

In his comments to journalists at the Emirates chalet on the runway of Al Maktoum International Airport, Clark raised concerns about the maintenance required for the Rolls Royce engines on the A350.

“If the engine was doing what we want it to do ... then it would re-enter the mix of assessment for our fleet plan,” Clark said.

But in a statement to the Associated Press, Rolls Royce said “The A350-900 XWB-84 is the best engine out there when you look at efficiency, durability and reliability.”

“The Airbus A350 and Rolls-Royce Trent XWB have proven again and again to be a winning combination. More than 56 customers have chosen to order and/or operate the aircraft which has set an industry benchmark for efficiency and reliability,” the statement added.

Airbus did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Emirates is a heavyweight when it comes to East-West travel out of Dubai International Airport, the world’s busiest for international travel.

Clark also said that Emirates needs to buy aircraft now as it moves forward with plans to expand its routes and networks.

“Irrespective of the difficulties of getting these aircraft out of the door, we have to place orders now because the lead time for deliveries are so long,” Clark said.

Clark also said that the tensions in the wider Middle East sparked by the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip wouldn’t affect Emirates’ business, adding they are used to working around the region’s geopolitical problems. He said although the Israeli market was one of the fastest growing markets for Emirates, they had to stop their daily flights to Tel Aviv, Israel, but that the airline was able to absorb the demand fall-off.

Emirates and FlyDubai launched direct flights to Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv after the two countries established diplomatic ties in 2020.

Two major Israeli firms — Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd. and Israel Aerospace Industries — had been slated to participate in the Dubai Air Show. But the IAI stand, bearing the slogan “Where Courage Meets Technology,” was roped off and empty Monday. On Tuesday, a few people gathered there.

Also in the market for aircraft is Riyadh Air, a new Saudi carrier being created as part of trillions of dollars worth of spending planned in the kingdom. In March, the airline announced an order of up to 72 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner jetliners and has further plans to expand.

Clark said he wasn’t worried about the competition, however.

“If Saudi Arabia wants to spend $2 trillion on doing wonderful things over there, they’ve got to have the labor from somewhere. And that labor force has got to be brought in, and their carriers are going to find it difficult in the early stages to meet that demand,” he said. “So do I think it’s a problem with this lot? No, I don’t … because we managed to build Emirates through all of this competition, rising geopolitical socioeconomic difficulty.”

The air show, which sees billions of dollars worth of deals, including by arms manufacturers, comes two weeks before Dubai hosts the United Nations’ COP28 climate talks.

Aviation has particularly drawn the ire of climate change activists, in part due to the amount of jet fuel the industry burns. Emirates in January successfully flew a Boeing 777 on a test flight with one of its two engines entirely powered by so-called sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. Earlier this month, the airline cleared SAF for flights, including one to Sydney, Australia.

However, “decarbonizing civil aviation is incredibly difficult and will be long term,” Clark said.

On Tuesday, Ethiopian announced its deal with Boeing that will see it buy the 737 MAX aircraft, as well as 11 787 Dreamliners. It also agreed to options to potentially buy another 36 aircraft - 21 MAX planes and 15 Dreamliners. Boeing described it as “the largest-ever purchase of Boeing airplanes in African history,” without offering a sales price for the deal.

The March 2019 MAX crash shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa killed all 157 people on board. It was the second involving a Boeing MAX in less than five months and led to a worldwide grounding of all MAX jets for nearly two years.

Asked about the crash, Ethiopian Group CEO Mesfin Tasew said it “has left a big scar in our memory.”

“We have checked and confirmed that the design defect of that aircraft has been fully corrected by Boeing and we have renewed our confidence in that aircraft,” he said.

Other purchases Tuesday included:

— Emirates announced $1.2 billion in deals with French firm Safran, including for seats.

— Emirates announced plans for a $950 million maintenance facility at Al Maktoum International Airport, the city-state’s second airfield.

— EgyptAir announced it would buy 10 Airbus A350-900s. It did not disclose the price of the aircraft.

— Boeing and SCAT Airlines of Kazakhstan announced the airline would purchase seven Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. It also did not disclose terms for the sale.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9864081144332886}",neutral,0.9864081144332886,0
Airbus' patented “Detumbler” to tackle in-orbit debris - Airbus,"Mon, 13 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0xMS1haXJidXMtcGF0ZW50ZWQtZGV0dW1ibGVyLXRvLXRhY2tsZS1pbi1vcmJpdC1kZWJyaXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus’ patented Detumbler device designed to prevent satellites at the end of their lives from tumbling, was launched on Saturday 11 November and will be tested in space on the mission in association with Exotrail and EnduroSat early in 2024.

Developed in 2021 by Airbus, and supported by the French Space Agency CNES under their Tech4SpaceCare initiative, the Detumbler is a magnetic damping device that would be attached to a satellite. The Detumbler includes a central rotor wheel and magnets that interact with the Earth’s magnetic field. When the satellite is flying normally the rotor acts like a compass following the magnetic field, but should the spacecraft begin to tumble the rotor movement induces eddy currents acting like a friction torque thus damping the motion.

CAD view of the reference design. The design involves the stator housing, with its bottom plate and top cover, and the rotor comprising the central axle, the rotor wheel and the magnets.

Dead satellites, especially in low Earth orbit (LEO), often end up tumbling which is natural behaviour due to orbital flight dynamics. Future active debris removal missions will face a greater challenge if spacecraft are tumbling. The Airbus Detumbler - weighing in at around 100g - could therefore be a useful tool for future missions to prevent satellites tumbling after their end of life, making them easier to capture on debris clearing missions.

The in-orbit demonstration of the Detumbler is scheduled for early 2024 on a mission from Exotrail (SpaceVan) which will include the Exo-0 nanosatellite from EnduroSat. Dedicated detumbling tests will take place to verify the ability of the Detumbler to dampen movement.

Aerial refuelling without human intervention - Airbus,"Fri, 24 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTExLWFlcmlhbC1yZWZ1ZWxsaW5nLXdpdGhvdXQtaHVtYW4taW50ZXJ2ZW50aW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aerial refuelling is an increasingly vital capability for military force projection, and Airbus-developed technology to automate the in-flight “topping off” of aircraft will revolutionise this process – with wider applications for both the defence and civil aviation sectors.

Disruptive technology for fully autonomous in-flight refuelling – designated Auto’Mate – is being evolved by the Airbus Defence and Space business unit in collaboration with Airbus UpNext, the company’s wholly-owned innovation subsidiary. Airbus UpNext also is pursuing such cross-division projects as pilot assistance technologies to further enhance flight safety and aircraft operational efficiency, along with new propulsion systems and aircraft design to face sustainability challenges.

Last March, a successful Auto’Mate demonstration using an Airbus testbed tanker aircraft and four unmanned drones marked a major milestone for the autonomous in-flight refuelling capability.

During a second flight test campaign conducted in November 2023, the Auto’Mate demonstrator showcased the potential of Autonomous Assets Air to Air Refuelling (A4R) operations flying with five unmanned drones (Airbus DT-25, two of them being digital twins) - under the control of an A310 MRTT tanker - simulating a refuelling operation, using advanced AI-based relative navigation and cooperative control technologies.



Enhanced safety, reliability and efficiency

By automating in-flight refuelling without the need for human intervention, an aerial tanker can take control of a “receiver” aircraft from several kilometres away and autonomously guide and control it into the proper position to receive fuel, followed by the actual fuel transfer via the tanker’s refuelling probe, completed by a safe separation manoeuvre at the operation’s completion.

The in-flight refuelling procedures utilised today require demanding and precise coordination between an aerial tanker’s crew and the pilot of the “receiver” aircraft. By applying autonomous technologies, the process will benefit from enhanced safety, reliability and efficiency. Other advantages are the ability to conduct more effective operations – including the transfer of fuel in very low visibility conditions, and the reduction of training costs for flight crews.

As importantly, the Auto’Mate technology opens the way for aerial refuelling of non-piloted combat air vehicles such as drones, apart from the technologies reuse in remote carriers and “loyal wingman”operations – which are key unmanned elements of Europe’s Future Combat Air System (FCAS). Furthermore, thanks to Auto’Mate technology, the whole refuelling operation can be carried out seamlessly without the need for human intervention, neither by the Aerial Refuelling Operator (ARO) on the tanker nor by the manned receiver’s pilot or the unmanned drone’s operator. This could eventually lead to autonomous tankers and aerial assets operating without a crew on board in the future.

Three technological “bricks” for automated aerial refuelling

In evolving autonomous in-flight refuelling, Airbus is focusing on three primary key technological foundations:

Navigation : the system can achieve unprecedented levels of position accuracy using different types of cameras, high-precision satellite global positioning, and LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) sensors, combined with AI and sensor fusion algorithms.

Communications: covert, secure and multi-node communication systems have been tested to guide several “receiver” aircraft.

Control: autonomous control systems take the lead in managing critical flight parameters, guaranteeing coordination, and safe and efficient operations with built-in collision avoidance functionalities.

Airbus is well positioned to take this next step for aerial refuelling, building on its experience in the domain – beginning with its A310 MRTT (Multi Role Tanker Transport) which entered service in 2004, and followed by the new-generation A330 MRTT.

Airbus’ leadership in aerial tankers with the A330 MRTT

The A330 MRTT positions Airbus as a leader in the multi-role tanker transport sector, having already pioneered such advancements as the use of fly-by-wire control for the refuelling probe and its development of a high-definition 2D/3D digital system for enhanced viewing by the fuelling operators.

A total of 60 A330 MRTTs have been ordered by Australia, France, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom, with the aircraft fleet logging thousands of flight hours in the support of military deployments and humanitarian operations.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9996428489685059}",positive,0.9996428489685059,1

These technologies, developed by Airbus UpNext, are controlled by a touchscreen tablet and aim to simplify mission preparation and management, reduce helicopter pilot workload, and further increase safety.

The Airbus Helicopters’ FlightLab flew fully automated from lift-off, taxi, takeoff, cruise, approach and then landing during a one hour test flight by following a predefined route. During this flight, the pilot monitored the system which is able to detect unforeseen obstacles and automatically recalculate a safe flight path. Whenever necessary the pilot can easily override the controls through the tablet and resume the mission afterwards. The flight test period ran from the 27th of October through to the 22nd of November at the Airbus Helicopters’ facility in Marignane, France.

“This successful demonstration of a fully autonomous flight from takeoff to landing is a great step towards the reduced pilot workload and simplified HMI that the Airbus Urban Air Mobility team intends to implement on CityAirbus NextGen. It could also have immediate applications for helicopters in low level flights close to obstacles thanks to the information provided by the lidars* on board,” said Michael Augello, CEO of Airbus UpNext.

Airbus Helicopters will continue to mature the different technologies that comprise Vertex: vision based sensors and algorithms for situational awareness and obstacle detection; fly-by-wire for enhanced auto-pilot; and an advanced human-machine-interface - in the form of a touchscreen and head worn display for inflight monitoring and control.

The MoU outlines that the parties intend to commonly foster science and technology development and explore the potential for collaboration in conjunction with post-International Space Station low-Earth orbit (LEO) destinations.

The collaboration will initially focus on, but is not limited to, exploring opportunities for sustained access to space for Europe through the Starlab space station. These could include:

Access to the Starlab space station for ESA and its Member States, for astronaut missions and sustained long-term research activities as well as commercial business development.

Contributions to research projects on upcoming missions, leveraging European technology across various fields, including (but not limited to) advanced robotics and automation/artificial intelligence, and advancing European science priorities, such as health and life sciences.

Establishment of a complete ‘end-to-end’ ecosystem comprising the Starlab space station as a low-Earth orbit destination and a potential ESA-developed European transportation system (cargo and crew), leveraging standardised interfaces in the interest of an open access policy.

This agreement reflects ESA’s ambition to enable a smooth transition from the International Space Station towards the sustained exploitation of human and robotic infrastructures in low-Earth orbit after 2030, including through commercial services.

“ESA appreciates the transatlantic industry initiative for the commercial Starlab space station, and the potential that its strong European footprint holds for significant European industrial and institutional contributions to, and use of, said station,” said Josef Aschbacher, Director General of the European Space Agency. “Our teams are looking forward to working closely with the Starlab teams here in Europe and in the US.”

In the past, Airbus has supplied ESA with iconic spacecraft such as the International Space Station Columbus Module, all five Automated Transfer Vehicles (ATV) and – most recently – the European Service Module (ESM) for Orion, Europe’s contribution to NASA’s Artemis missions back to the Moon.

In August 2023, Voyager and Airbus first announced an agreement to form a transatlantic joint venture to support a continuous human presence in low-Earth orbit and a seamless transition of microgravity science and research opportunities in the post-International Space Station era. Starlab is also expected to have a European affiliated joint venture to directly serve the European Space Agency and its member state space agencies.

Airbus to make Eurofighter fit for electronic combat - Airbus,"Wed, 29 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0xMS1haXJidXMtdG8tbWFrZS1ldXJvZmlnaHRlci1maXQtZm9yLWVsZWN0cm9uaWMtY29tYmF00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Munich, 29 November 2023 – Now it's official: The Eurofighter EK (Electronic Combat) is coming. Following the recent parliamentary approval by the German budget committee, Airbus will equip 15 German Eurofighters for electronic combat - and equip them with a transmitter location and self-protection system from Saab, as well as ""AARGM"" anti-radar missiles from the American company Northrop Grumman. The Eurofighter EK is to be NATO-certified by 2030 and will then replace the Tornado in the SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defence) role.

""Electronic warfare and reconnaissance are an important NATO requirement: current conflicts and the present security situation show how important the two capabilities are,"" says Airbus Defence and Space CEO Michael Schöllhorn. ""In this respect, the German government's decision to include such an important capability as electronic warfare in the Eurofighter capability portfolio is an important measure. EK will add this important capability to the already broad operational spectrum of the Eurofighter while strengthening European sovereignty and autonomy.""

With the parliamentary approval by the Budget Committee, the Eurofighter is now officially set as the successor to the Tornado ECR (Electronic Combat/Reconnaissance). Airbus is now looking forward to the official order to integrate the selected technical solutions into the Eurofighter. The corresponding contract between Eurofighter GmbH, as prime contractor, and NETMA (NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency) is expected to be signed before the end of the year.

With Saab’s transmitter location system and the Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM) from Northrop Grumman, the Eurofighter EK will be able to detect, localise and disable anti-aircraft radars. In addition, the Saab solution has jammers that improve the Eurofighter's self-protection. The Eurofighter EK also has technologies on board that were developed by small and medium-sized enterprises and a start-up. These include an AI solution that makes it possible to analyse radar data on-board and quickly determine precise self-protection measures.

Airbus is currently working with the BAAINBw procurement office, the German Air Force and the Bundeswehr Aviation Office on a detailed schedule for the implementation of the selected EK solutions in 15 Eurofighters.

CityAirbus NextGen leaves no milestone unturned - Airbus,"Sun, 26 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTExLWNpdHlhaXJidXMtbmV4dGdlbi1sZWF2ZXMtbm8tbWlsZXN0b25lLXVudHVybmVk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CityAirbus NextGen’s imminent power-on is the latest in a year of exciting developments. Here's an update on the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) prototype with Balkiz Sarihan, Head of Urban Air Mobility at Airbus.

“Someone asked me what we’re focusing on this year, and I said, ‘we’re going to build, build, build.’ This is what we’ve done,” says Balkiz Sarihan, smiling. At Airbus Helicopters’ Donauwörth facilities, the CityAirbus NextGen was being assembled as she spoke. “Anytime we arrive on site, you want to run and see what else is new.”

Watching it take shape, with subcomponents arriving daily, is what the team has been working on for two years since the prototype’s launch. However, this – and the power-on milestone – are only the most visible signs of a programme advancing on all fronts.

Not just the vehicle

CityAirbus NextGen has taken the best of Airbus helicopter, commercial and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) know-how to produce an optimised all-electric, winged, vertical lift architecture. Yet “because the advanced air mobility (AAM) industry is so new, we focus on the vehicle’s ‘ecosystem’: everything that will enable its introduction into service,” says Sarihan.

Key to this was Airbus’ investment in a dedicated test hangar to mature disruptive technology—especially subcomponents - and conduct the first phases of the flight test campaign. The latter were the subject of Airbus’ extensive capabilities, including pôles of expertise at which technobricks developed simultaneously. The battery pack by Airbus Defence and Space and propellers made in Paris Le Bourget have been tested and delivered. The innovative flight control system, in development with the Vertex project, underwent successful testing in October on the FlightLab.

“The simplicity we want to include as part of this eVTOL design is key,” says Sarihan, who stresses that CityAirbus NextGen will initially roll out as a piloted vehicle even as it is envisaged to be as easy to fly as possible.

The more the merrier

Simplicity is vital, and so are partnerships. Beyond developing the vehicle architecture and technobricks, to test the product’s flight ecosystem Airbus created the Bavaria-based Air Mobility Initiative (AMI), the first working group of its kind, with key partners such as Munich International Airport, the City of Ingolstadt and the talents of Airbus Urban Mobility, as well as research institutes and universities. Teams are tasked with developing VTOL flight paths and an advanced unmanned traffic management system. They also created the U-space prototype, which showcases scenarios such as how to prioritise emergency flights in a crowded airspace of drones, VTOLs and traditional vehicles. The airspace integration of vertiports at airports and in urban areas is also being examined.

Laying the groundwork (literally)

Airbus Urban Mobility is also looking at how ground infrastructure will accommodate VTOLs. Will the vehicle take off and land airside or landside? A design team at Munich Airport is working with Airbus on the first designs of a vertiport, while two collaborative projects are analysing the integration of vertiports in different environments. Nor has Airbus forgotten to include people in the simulation. AMI projects also focus on the passenger experience, imagining their needs while in transit and soliciting preferences from user studies.

To develop the support and services needed when CityAirbus NextGen takes to the skies, Airbus’ experience supporting a fleet of vehicles and operators around the globe is “what it means to be a trusted brand,” says Sarihan. “When our customers rely on that vehicle as part of their business, they will have the entire support system for whatever they need.” Airbus depicts an AAM ecosystem as holistic, from MRO, air traffic management, and service to ferry flights, drawing on the company’s vast analogous knowledge in these areas.

“This is the first time in modern aviation history where we are building so many elements at the exact moment in parallel,” says Sarihan. But, she stresses, Airbus is conscious of its responsibility as a pioneer “to introduce the right product for the right market at the right time and – I cannot stress this enough – with the right technology maturity.”

Partnering for market preparedness

Because no market yet exists for UAM, Airbus insists on the co-creation of CityAirbus NextGen and its first use cases with operators representing a variety of circumstances. “We look at use cases where we believe this new technology will be additive to the communities they serve,” Sarihan says.

Airbus has partnered with several entities to study possible urban air mobility (UAM) markets, including:

Medical services

Norwegian Air Ambulance Foundation in Norway, to study the configuration and equipment a medical service provider would use

The Estonian health department, to look at the entire health system of a country

Rotorcraft operator Hiratagakuen in Japan, to study route optimisation for the most effective approaches, landing spots, and services from a community acceptance perspective.

Scheduled shuttle and eco-tourism

The Helicopter Service (THC) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to enable the safe introduction of an urban air mobility system

ITA Airways in Italy, to identify pilot cases for UAM in Italy

Rotorcraft operator Ecocopter, to gain insight into UAM services in Latin America

AMI: today’s start for tomorrow’s potential

CityAirbus NextGen represents a starting point for understanding how eVTOLS will mesh with their operational environment. Projects carried out by Airbus through its partnership with the Air Mobility Initiative (AMI) have the potential to gather numerous valuable insights into the best way to support customers, users and diverse populations as advanced air mobility comes to their doorstep. The two entities therefore share the joint mission of accelerating the development of an AAM ecosystem so the CityAirbus NextGen can bring added value to communities.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9946763515472412}",neutral,0.9946763515472412,0
Air Niugini orders the A220 - Airbus,"Wed, 01 Nov 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0xMS1haXItbml1Z2luaS1vcmRlcnMtdGhlLWEyMjDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"@Airbus @PXPNG #A220 #Navblue

Toulouse, France - 1 November 2023 - Air Niugini, the national carrier of Papua New Guinea, has signed a firm order with Airbus for six latest generation single aisle A220-100s under its fleet modernisation programme. In addition, the carrier will acquire three A220-300s and another two A220-100s from third party lessors.

The order was announced at a special event in Port Moresby by Gary Seddon, Acting Chief Executive Officer Air Niugini and Anand Stanley, President Airbus Asia-Pacific, in the presence of the Hon. James Marape, Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea and Hon. William Duma, Minister for State Enterprises.

Combining the longest range, lowest fuel consumption and widest cabin in the 100-150 seat category, the A220 will be operated by Air Niugini across its domestic and regional network. The new fleet will deliver more capacity and greater reliability across the domestic network and enable the carrier to fly from capital Port Moresby to new destinations across the Asia-Pacific region.

Gary Seddon, Acting Chief Executive Officer of Air Niugini said: “This is a milestone in the history of our national airline that will support the growth of trade and tourism in Papua New Guinea. The new aircraft will offer the highest levels of comfort for our passengers, while also ensuring a significant reduction in fuel consumption and emissions when compared to the aircraft they will replace.”

Minister Duma said: “This is a momentous occasion for Air Niugini. Coinciding with the airline’s 50th Anniversary, Air Niugini secures six new regional jets that will revolutionise travel for the citizens of Papua New Guinea. I am looking forward to welcoming the ‘People’s Balus’ (the people’s plane) to our skies”.

Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer and Head of International, said: “Air Niugini has seen how much more the A220 brings to their airline than the competing product in this space, so much more efficiency, range, comfort and growth potential. We thank Air Niugini for its confidence in Airbus and are committed to offering our full support to the airline as it transitions to its new fleet.”

Air Niugini also announced that it has selected a flight planning support system from Airbus subsidiary NAVBLUE for its fleet. Called N-Flight Planning (N-FP), the solution will help the airline optimise on fuel, time and cost to meet operational needs, while ensuring overall safety and compliance.

The A220 is the most modern airliner in its size category, carrying between 100 to 150 passengers on flights of up to 3,450 nautical miles (6,390 km). Depending on cabin configuration, the A220-100 serves the 100-135 seat market, while the larger A220-300 is perfectly tailored for the 120-150 seat market.

The aircraft is powered by Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation GTF™ engines. Offering 25% lower fuel burn and CO2 emissions per seat compared to previous generation aircraft, the A220 also has the largest cabin, seats and windows in its class, ensuring superior comfort.

As with all Airbus aircraft, the A220 is already able to operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Airbus aims for all its aircraft to be capable of operating with 100% SAF by 2030.

As at the end of September, Airbus has received over 800 orders from around 30 customers for the A220, of which more than 280 have been delivered. The A220 is already in successful service with 17 airlines worldwide.

eXtra Performance Wing demonstrator takes off - Airbus,"Wed, 08 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTExLWV4dHJhLXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLXdpbmctZGVtb25zdHJhdG9yLXRha2VzLW9mZtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Led by Airbus subsidiary and technology incubator UpNext, the eXtra Performance Wing project aims to improve flight performance and respond to environmental concerns by completely rethinking aircraft wings as we know them today.

Using biomimicry – biologically inspired engineering – the project seeks to develop a wing that can change shape and form during flight to maximise its aerodynamic efficiency. If the concept is successful and integrated into new aircraft, it has the potential to significantly reduce fuel consumption.

The November first flight was an important milestone for the project because the demonstrator is fitted with the exact systems that it will have when the eXtra Performance Wings are installed for flight testing starting in 2025. The data gleaned from this and subsequent flight tests will allow Airbus engineers to measure important baseline performance metrics that will be used to determine the impact of the new wing design, such as reductions in CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption.

While the eXtra Performance Wing technologies could be applicable to any kind of aircraft and propulsion system, the chosen demonstrator is a modified Cessna Citation VII business jet. As the targeted wingspan of the eXtra Performance Wing is more than 50 metres (that’s long: an A320 wingspan is 35.8 metres), the Cessna’s 16 metre wingspan represents an approximately one-third scale model of the final design.

“Things are evidently simpler at a smaller scale,” says Sebastien Blanc, eXtra Performance Wing Technical Director. “But we chose the Cessna specifically because it constituted the best trade off between project complexity and representativeness of the final design.”

The eXtra Performance Wing: a design overview

Launched in September 2021 the eXtra Performance Wing project is part of Airbus' Wing Research portfolio. This project explores some of the many technologies that could one day be integrated into the next-generation of Airbus aircraft, and complements the Wing of Tomorrow programme. Airbus UpNext seeks to fast-track future technologies by developing radical technological breakthroughs in an agile environment.

The overall goal of the eXtra Performance Wing project is to provide multiple wing configurations that dynamically adapt to flight conditions. The design incorporates innovative active control technologies as well as physical changes to the wing structure. Gust sensors on the front of the aircraft will register changes in turbulence, triggering relevant adjustments to the control surfaces of the wing. “This system is designed to be entirely automatic,” says Blanc. “The eXtra Performance Wing technologies, which change the shape of the wing by mimicking a bird's feathers, will adjust automatically to maximise aerodynamic flow.”

There are also the hinged wingtips, which have a dual purpose. On the ground they prevent the aircraft from exceeding the maximum wingspan length that can be accommodated at airport gates (36 metres), and in the air they are flexible, able to change shape to avoid putting too much pressure on the wing. The wingtips also allow for a longer span to be achieved, increasing lift and reducing drag.

To ensure the feasibility of the concept, a 3D-printed wind-tunnel model has already been tested extensively at low speeds at Airbus' wing research facility in Filton, UK. With testing now completed, the design has been finalised and manufacturing of the different wing parts has already begun. The eXtra Performance Wing demonstrator’s production is a classic example of collaboration between Airbus’ four founding nations: the UK is manufacturing the wings, Spain will build the folding wingtips, and the high lift system will be designed in Germany. The modification and assembly of the aircraft will take place in France.

Up next: touch down in Cazaux, France

Once the initial flight testing has harvested enough baseline data, the demonstrator will be flown to Cazaux, France, where it will be based for the remainder of the project. A remote operation system will be integrated into the aircraft, followed by flights to test the communication between the 20 antennas on the aircraft and the control centre on the ground. Then, in 2024, the eXtra Performance Wings will be attached to the Cessna and undergo ground testing before the first flights begin in 2025.

The demonstrator will be remotely piloted during flight testing to enable UpNext's engineers to push the technologies onboard to their limits. As the Cessna is only a demonstrator and will not be put into production, the decision to have a pilot test the plane from a ground centre instead of onboard also alleviates the need to certify the demonstrator for human flight. “We want the flight testing to expose the eXtra Performance Wing to as many realistic flying situations as possible. This will give the different technologies the best possible chance of proving themselves, and of one day being integrated into the wings of tomorrow,” explains Blanc.

The results of the remotely piloted flight testing will determine the success of the different technologies, but already Blanc says the project is paying off: “We are already seeing the fruits of our labour, and we have learned so much along the way. We have a real opportunity here to make a contribution to reducing fuel burn. Just having the potential to change the aerospace industry like this is huge.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9815830588340759}",positive,0.9815830588340759,1
Airbus reports Nine-Month (9m) 2023 results - Airbus,"Wed, 08 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0xMS1haXJidXMtcmVwb3J0cy1uaW5lLW1vbnRoLTltLTIwMjMtcmVzdWx0c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"488 commercial aircraft delivered in 9m 2023

Revenues € 42.6 billion; EBIT Adjusted € 3.6 billion

EBIT (reported) € 2.7 billion; EPS (reported) € 2.96

Free cash flow before M&A and customer financing € 1.0 billion

Charges on certain satellite development programmes

Guidance maintained

Amsterdam, 08 November 2023 – Airbus SE (stock exchange symbol: AIR) reported consolidated financial results for the nine months ended 30 September 2023.

“We continue to make progress on our operational plan in a global environment that has become increasingly complex. The nine-month earnings reflect higher commercial aircraft deliveries, the good performance in helicopters as well as charges linked to the reassessment of certain satellite development programmes,” said Guillaume Faury, Airbus Chief Executive Officer. “Demand for our commercial aircraft is very strong with a continuing recovery in the widebody market. We expect the supply chain to remain challenging as we progress on the production ramp-up. In that context, we maintain our guidance for the full year.”

Gross commercial aircraft orders totalled 1,280 (9m 2022: 856 aircraft) with net orders of 1,241 aircraft after cancellations (9m 2022: 647 aircraft). The order backlog amounted to 7,992 commercial aircraft at the end of September 2023. Airbus Helicopters registered 191 net orders (9m 2022: 246 units) which were well spread across programmes. Airbus Defence and Space’s order intake by value was € 8.5 billion (9m 2022: € 8.0 billion), including the renewal of the in-service support contract for Germany’s A400M fleet.

Consolidated revenues increased 12 percent year-on-year to € 42.6 billion (9m 2022: € 38.1 billion). A total of 488 commercial aircraft were delivered (9m 2022: 437(1)(2) aircraft), comprising 41 A220s, 391 A320 Family, 20 A330s and 36 A350s. Revenues generated by Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities increased 18 percent, mainly reflecting the higher number of deliveries. Airbus Helicopters’ deliveries increased slightly to 197 units (9m 2022: 193 units) with revenues rising 3 percent, reflecting the overall performance across programmes and services. Revenues at Airbus Defence and Space decreased 6 percent, mainly driven by a backloaded A400M delivery profile and updated Estimates at Completion of certain satellite development programmes. A total of 4 A400M military airlifters were delivered (9m 2022: 7 aircraft).

Consolidated EBIT Adjusted – an alternative performance measure and key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses – was € 3,631 million (9m 2022: € 3,481 million).

EBIT Adjusted related to Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities increased to € 3,216 million (9m 2022: € 2,875 million), reflecting the higher deliveries and a more favourable hedge rate, partially offset by investments for preparing the future. 9m 2022 included the non-recurring positive impact from retirement obligations partly offset by the impact resulting from international sanctions against Russia. In H1 2023 provisions were released to reflect further progress made on compliance-related topics.

The ramp-up on the A220 programme is continuing towards a monthly production rate of 14 aircraft in 2026. Production on the A320 Family programme is progressing well towards the previously announced rate of 75 aircraft per month in 2026. The modernisation and digitalisation of the industrial system continues, as illustrated by the inauguration of the A321XLR equipment installation hangar in Hamburg. The A321XLR is progressing towards certification, with entry-into-service expected to take place in Q2 2024.

On widebody aircraft, the Company has decided to increase the production rate for the A350 to 10 aircraft a month in 2026 and continues to target rate 4 for the A330 in 2024.

Airbus Helicopters’ EBIT Adjusted increased to € 417 million (9m 2022: € 380 million), reflecting the overall performance across programmes and services. 9m 2022 also included net positive non-recurring elements.

EBIT Adjusted at Airbus Defence and Space decreased to € -1 million (9m 2022: € 231 million). It included charges of € 0.4 billion related to updated Estimates at Completion of certain satellite development programmes, mostly recorded in the third quarter. 9m 2022 also included net positive non-recurring elements.

On the A400M programme, development activities continue towards achieving the revised capability roadmap. Retrofit activities are progressing in close alignment with the customer. No further net material impact was recognised in the first nine months of 2023. Risks remain on the qualification of technical capabilities and associated costs, on aircraft operational reliability, on cost reductions and on securing overall volume as per the revised baseline.

In order to cope with an evolving defence and security environment, the Company has launched a transformation of its Defence and Space division. This aims to adapt ways of working, focusing on rigorous programme execution and a rebalancing of risks and opportunities to reinforce end-to-end accountability and ownership in the business lines and improve competitiveness.

Consolidated self-financed R&D expenses totalled € 2,167 million (9m 2022: € 1,965 million).

Consolidated EBIT (reported) amounted to € 2,712 million (9m 2022: € 3,552 million), including net Adjustments of € -919 million.

These Adjustments comprised:

€ -806 million related to the dollar pre-delivery payment mismatch and balance sheet revaluation, of which € -155 million were in Q3. This mainly reflects the phasing impact arising from the difference between transaction date and delivery date;

€ -57 million related to the Aerostructures transformation, of which € -23 million were in Q3;

€ -56 million of other costs including compliance, of which € -10 million were in Q3.

The financial result was € 231 million (9m 2022: € -306 million). It mainly reflects a positive impact from the revaluation of certain equity investments and the evolution of the US dollar, partly offset by negative impacts from the revaluation of financial instruments. Consolidated net income(3) was € 2,332 million (9m 2022: € 2,568 million) with consolidated reported earnings per share of € 2.96 (9m 2022: € 3.26).

Consolidated free cash flow before M&A and customer financing was € 1,037 million (9m 2022: € 2,899 million), mainly reflecting the inventory build-up in Q3, consistent with the backloaded delivery profile and production ramp-up.

Consolidated free cash flow of € 718 million (9m 2022: € 2,502 million) included € -261 million of customer financing, mostly related to the planned execution of certain contractual obligations. The gross cash position stood at € 22.4 billion at the end of September 2023 (year-end 2022: € 23.6 billion), with a consolidated net cash position of € 8.3 billion (year-end 2022: € 9.4 billion).

Outlook

The guidance issued in February 2023 is maintained.

As the basis for its 2023 guidance, the Company assumes no additional disruptions to the world economy, air traffic, the supply chain, the Company’s internal operations, and its ability to deliver products and services.

The Company’s 2023 guidance is before M&A.

On that basis, the Company targets to achieve in 2023 around:

720 commercial aircraft deliveries;

EBIT Adjusted of € 6.0 billion;

Free Cash Flow before M&A and Customer Financing of € 3.0 billion.

On 26 October 2023, Airbus received notice from the US State Department that the Consent Agreement it had entered into in January 2020 had been closed, based on fulfilment of its terms. This notice, as well as the earlier discontinuation of the deferred prosecution agreements of Airbus with the UK Serious Fraud Office, France’s Parquet National Financier and the US Department of Justice, concludes a three-year probation period during which Airbus demonstrated to the authorities its commitment to compliance and integrity. This enables Airbus to move forward and continue to grow in a sustainable and responsible manner.

Contrail-chasing Blue Condor makes Airbus' first full hydrogen-powered flight - Airbus,"Thu, 16 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTExLWNvbnRyYWlsLWNoYXNpbmctYmx1ZS1jb25kb3ItbWFrZXMtYWlyYnVzLWZpcnN0LWZ1bGwtaHlkcm9nZW4tcG93ZXJlZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The modified glider at the centre of Airbus UpNext’s hydrogen contrail-studying experiment, Blue Condor, made its first hydrogen-powered flight over Nevada in the United States on 8 November. The flight was the company’s first ever to use hydrogen as the sole fuel source, and it kicked off a test campaign that will conclude in a contrail-measuring mission in early 2024.

Watch Airbus' Blue Condor first flight

Hydrogen offers aviation a path to low-carbon operations, yet its combustion produces contrails just like conventional jet fuel. Hydrogen contrails, however, differ significantly. They don’t contain soot or sulphur oxides, but do hold nitrous oxides and a lot of water vapour: up to 2.5 times more than kerosene contrails. Both are considered climate-impacting emissions, and as such the aviation industry has a duty to address them.

Therefore, as part of the ZEROe project, Airbus is committed to studying the composition of these little-understood hydrogen contrails. Using a modified Arcus-J glider, Airbus UpNext’s Blue Condor project will take a small hydrogen-combustion engine as high as 30,000 feet and compare its emissions to a similar-sized kerosene engine, flying alongside onboard a second aircraft. Both gliders are operated by The Perlan Project and the hydrogen engine was assembled by German company Aero Design Works.

Blue Condor has now entered its flight test phase. The 8 November flight lasted around 30 minutes and its aim was to increase the hydrogen engine’s thrust at 7,000 feet, while stabilising the aircraft at different speeds. Two further flights have taken place since, performing tests including an engine start at 10,000 feet.

The Blue Condor team plans to operate a first contrail-studying operation during Nevada’s cold-weather window early next year. Then, the Arcus-J will be towed to test altitude by a Grob Egrett aircraft instrumented by the German aerospace lab DLR. This ‘chase’ aircraft will then follow behind, using sensors to collect and analyse contrail and atmospheric data. The flight promises to be a big step in furthering understanding of hydrogen’s climate impact, and ultimately in reaching Airbus’ ZEROe target entry into service in 2035.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999940395355225}",neutral,0.9999940395355225,0
German Navy NH90 Sea Tiger performs maiden flight - Airbus,"Thu, 30 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0xMS1nZXJtYW4tbmF2eS1uaDkwLXNlYS10aWdlci1wZXJmb3Jtcy1tYWlkZW4tZmxpZ2h00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Donauwörth – The first NH90 Sea Tiger took off on-schedule for its maiden flight, at Airbus Helicopters' site in Donauwörth, Germany. The German Bundeswehr ordered 31 NH90 Sea Tiger multi-role frigate helicopters for the German Navy’s shipborne operations in 2020.

Airbus Helicopters is now entering a qualification phase that will focus on flight testing the helicopter and new systems to be installed on board the NH90 Sea Tiger. Deliveries are scheduled to begin at the end of 2025.

""We are proud to equip the German Navy with the NH90 Sea Tiger. Operating both the NH90 Sea Lion and the Sea Tiger will allow the Navy to further streamline its operations and maintenance,"" said Stefan Thomé, Managing Director of Airbus Helicopters in Germany. ""The NH90 Sea Lion, which is already in service with the Navy, has recently proven its capabilities during a first major rescue operation in the North Sea.”

The helicopters will replace the German Navy’s ageing Mk88A Sea Lynx fleet which entered into service in 1981. The Bundeswehr already operates 18 NH90 Sea Lion naval transport helicopters which were delivered on schedule between 2019 and 2023.

The Sea Tiger is the latest version of the proven NH90 NFH (Naval Version). It has been specifically designed to match the needs of the German Navy for a state of the art anti-submarine warfare helicopter. Novelties include a new Electro-Optical System and improved Electronic Support Measures (ESM). On top, the Sea Tiger is equipped with a dipping sonar, sonobuoys, and weapons (torpedoes and missiles). The shipborne Sea Tigers’ missions include, in addition to reconnaissance and transport, engaging targets above and below the surface.

135 naval NH90 helicopters have already been delivered to six nations and have completed over 90,000 flight hours in search and rescue, humanitarian, and military operations. There are more than 500 NH90 helicopters in service worldwide that have accumulated over 370,000 flight hours.

NHIndustries is the largest rotorcraft joint venture and it is responsible for the design, manufacturing and support of the NH90 helicopter, one of the leaders in the latest generation of military helicopters. The Company takes the best from the European rotorcraft and defence industry, being owned by Airbus Helicopters (62.5%), Leonardo (32%) and GKN Fokker (5.5%). Each company has a long aerospace pedigree and brings the top of its skills and expertise to the end product.

Airbus Sees Higher Output in 2024 Amid Surging Demand - SupplyChainBrain,"Mon, 13 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1cHBseWNoYWluYnJhaW4uY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzM4NDgwLWFpcmJ1cy1zZWVzLWhpZ2hlci1vdXRwdXQtaW4tMjAyNC1hbWlkLXN1cmdpbmctZGVtYW5k0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus SE said it will significantly increase aircraft output in 2024 as the European planemaker ramps up production across its model range to meet surging demand.

The company didn’t provide a new target for output while saying it’s confident of meeting its goal of 720 deliveries in 2023. The planemaker will increase production of its A350 widebody aircraft, adding to previously announced higher rates on its best-selling A321neo and smaller A220 models.

“By definition, by nature, the 2024 output will be significantly higher than 2023, and we’ll be more specific at the beginning of next year,” chief executive officer Guillaume Faury said on a call with reporters after the planemaker reported quarterly earnings.

Planemakers are trying to strike a balance between customers buying planes in record numbers and suppliers struggling to keep up with the faster pace of production. Both Airbus and rival Boeing Co. have encountered roadblocks with manufacturing faults at some parts companies, making their ambitious output goals more challenging.

Airbus declined as much as 3.1%, or €4, to €126.34, its biggest drop in almost a month. The company fell short of analyst profit estimates largely because of charges at its defense and space unit. Third-quarter adjusted profit before interest and tax reached €1.01 billion ($1.1 billion), while analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated €1.17 billion.

The European company still has 161 deliveries to go in the final two months of 2023 if it wants to meet its target.

Airbus said November 8 that it plans to raise output on the A350 to 10 a month in 2026, after previously saying it would reach 9 by the end of 2025. The aircraft has been a major seller for the company in 2023, particularly the larger A350-1000 variant that can ply the longest routes, with Airbus approaching an unprecedented 100 individual orders for the plane.

While the recovery in long-haul travel took more time after the pandemic than shorter routes, demand for trans-Atlantic flights and trips between Europe and Asia has surged in the last six months. More airlines are also ordering planes that can fly extended routes, in part because closed air spaces over Russia, Ukraine and certain sections of the Middle East have made detour journeys more common.

Division Review

Boeing is also increasing the output of its popular 787 widebody model. The company is moving in on a target of assembling five of the twin-aisle 787 Dreamliner, which competes with the A350, per month by the close of the year. The U.S. company plans to double production of the carbon-composite 787 over the next two to three years to keep pace with booming sales.

In the third quarter, revenue at Airbus rose 12% to €14.9 billion, broadly in line with analyst estimates of €14.96 billion. The planemaker took a charge of about €400 million in the first nine months due to delays and cost overruns on a satellite program.

Airbus’ American Depositary Receipts fell 0.5% to $34.25. The shares closed 0.9% higher in Europe ahead of the earnings report.

The company said it has initiated a review of its Defense and Space unit, with a plan to rebalance risks and improve competitiveness. The unit lost €79 million before interest and taxes in the quarter. Faury said the company doesn’t plan to exit the business and expects a transformation to take as many as five years.

Supply Issues

Airbus has been struggling to ramp up the output of its bestselling A321neo model even as the backlog for the model stretches past the end of this decade. The planemaker said that the supply chain for the industry continues to be constrained as it reiterated its long-term ambition of building 75 A320neo jets a month by 2026.

In October, Boeing cut its target for deliveries of its workhorse 737 model due to expanded inspections and rework following manufacturing glitches by a supplier.

Alongside existing part shortages, Airbus is contending with potentially flawed components on Pratt & Whitney engines powering its A320neo aircraft. 2024 will likely see hundreds of aircraft on the ground at any given time for inspection, further curtailing already strained capacity.

Airbus is working with Pratt to balance deliveries of engines for new aircraft along with ensuring an adequate supply of spare engines for the existing fleet, Faury said.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7044360041618347}",positive,0.7044360041618347,1

Airbus U.S. Space and Defense on Nov. 9 unveiled the creation of its uncrewed aircraft systems office, which will be led by Brian Zarchin, a retired U.S. Army aviator. The new group builds upon Airbus’ previous success with its Zephyr drone, a solar-powered aircraft that stayed aloft for 64 days above 60,000 feet during testing over Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona.

“With ongoing great power competition, it’s critical that we do our part to help deter threats and, in crisis or conflict, present our adversaries with multiple dilemmas,” Zarchin said in a statement. “Our new business line is laser-focused on helping the DoD solve its toughest UAS challenges, from surface to stratosphere.”

The Department of Defense is increasingly interested in unmanned aerial systems and their battlefield applications, including intelligence gathering, targeting assistance and ordnance delivery.

RELATED

The department in August rolled out its Replicator initiative, calling for thousands of attritable systems in the field in the next 18 to 24 months to counter perceived Chinese capabilities. Additional details have been scant. U.S. Army leadership has suggested the service could contribute one-way attack drones and ground-based robotics.

“The future battlespace is here, and our team is ensuring the warfighter is equipped with technology that allows them to make informed decisions to counter the threat,” Rob Geckle, chairman and CEO of Airbus U.S. Space and Defense, said in a statement. “And while the Zephyr stratospheric platform is our foundational UAS program, we envision multiple UAS solutions supporting a range of customer missions and operational needs.”

Airbus is the 12th largest defense contractor in the world when ranked by defense-related revenue, according to Defense News’s Top 100 list. The company, which lists its headquarters in the Netherlands and its main office in France, earned a little more than $12 billion in defense-related revenue in 2022.

Active listening: Airbus unveils evolved training offer - Airbus,"Thu, 30 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTExLWFjdGl2ZS1saXN0ZW5pbmctYWlyYnVzLXVudmVpbHMtZXZvbHZlZC10cmFpbmluZy1vZmZlctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters listened to customers and put their needs under the lens, and revamped its training to offer type rating course preparation through to refresh and recurrent training to maintain, update and enhance proficiency.

Inflexible course lengths, locations, languages...training is a challenge even in the best circumstances. Airbus’ role is to remove the extra hurdles and create a learning environment that fosters safety and competence in helicopter operations.

By gathering customer feedback regarding their needs, Airbus has improved and expanded on its training and flight ops portfolio. With this new offering, unveiled at European Rotors 2023, the OEM has addressed a growing range of customer needs with solutions that reflect greater choice, tailoring and innovation. “We’re prioritising continuous improvement of the trainee experience,” says Melchior Kaag, Head of Training & Flight Ops at Airbus Helicopters. “With this restructuring we adapted our offer according to strategic axes we heard from customer input to propose a greater range of courses, innovative digital tools and means, and a larger network to offer customers a training package fully adapted to them.”

As one of the pillars in Airbus’ HCare service offer in its HCare Store, the evolution in training reflects the overhaul of HCare one year ago to offer customers tailorable combinations of service plan—in the case of training, it includes a commitment to quality and to the OEM’s high standards.

Is there a trainer in the house?

The new training approach now aims at an uninterrupted corps of knowledge, available to pilots and technicians in a more adaptable way. The aim is to accompany students not only in getting their initial type ratings but in preparing them for it beforehand. Similarly, new courses help trainees go beyond the basics, as they acquire a solid proficiency and mastery of skills and know-how.

“Our goal with this training re-look is to accompany customers in an end-to-end acquisition of knowledge,” says Melchior Kaag. “From preparing them to achieve their type rating, to ensuring they keep up their proficiency with refresher training, the aim is to make training make sense to students.”

To do this, Airbus reviewed the goals and means behind its offer. The subsequent restructuring and deployment of new classes according to helicopter type and training philosophy resulted in a clearer offer; now, for instance, an H125 operator need only refer to H125 training to find pertinent courses. Technician, pilot or avionics objectives are now more apparent – ‘validation of a type qualification’, for instance, or ‘acquiring mission expertise’ – and lay out at each step the goals Airbus has set and how trainees’ knowledge will evolve throughout the programme. Just as clear are the tools (virtual maintenance trainer, full flight simulator) available to achieve them. Short, “cheat sheet” type-specific ID cards set out briefly the curriculum, ground school and hand’s-on means offered throughout Airbus’ global training network.

Current means confident

Because keeping current is at the heart of safe, efficient operations, Airbus also amped up its offer on refresh and recurrent training. The OEM is expanding its offerings in blended learning sessions and web-based recurrent training for a growing number of helicopter types. The advantage of web-based training means students of the H125, H135 and H145 (and, progressively, other aircraft in the range) can study anywhere, even in their home office. At the same time, Airbus is putting resources into developing innovative tools like virtual maintenance trainers and virtual reality (VR) simulators – which it co-developed, with the added benefit that these tools feature OEM-direct data for better real-world training.

The offer also goes further in supporting trainees’ deeper acquisition of skills, especially through means and tools. Expanded solutions include more full-scale mock-ups, digital trainers, video training and smaller-scale VR and fully-immersive simulators. With the development of new digital tools that take advantage of real helicopter data, Airbus gives trainees the benefit of life-like scenarios in a controlled environment. Customers thus ensure safe, top-quality training while retaining the use of their existing fleet for operations.

Clear and present: solutions nearer to home

Another key evolution arising from customer feedback and borne out by the OEM’s experience is that bringing training closer to client operations adds up to better skills and safety. Now, operators can schedule more frequent refresh/recurrent training without the expense of traveling too far to a training centre or any loss of revenue due to crew absences. Such close-to-home alternatives to training include additional full-flight simulators making their appearance in Europe and the Americas; a growing number of local operators-cum-qualified training centres; and pilot and technician training capabilities springing up in Latin America and Asia for the newer aircraft in the range.

Airbus also takes into account the needs of the fleet in each particular region and is progressively implementing physical training means and courses that are adapted to the area. This also extends to coming machines like the H160 as the aircraft is introduced worldwide.

In expanding the offer to take advantage of innovations in technology, Airbus ensures students get the most modern teaching methods, up-to-date information and high-fidelity graphics to improve their learning outcome. A series of digital tools like Component Locators and the P-Check application (so pilots can train for this inspection) elevate students’ knowledge of the helicopter, while a revamped online learning management system joins other flexible and cost-effective solutions—always with the gain of bringing OEM-level excellence to operators’ door-steps.

Dubai Air Show: Boeing Soars Above Airbus with Massive Orders - Business Traveler USA,"Thu, 16 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3N0cmF2ZWxlcnVzYS5jb20vbmV3cy9kdWJhaS1haXItc2hvdy1maW5hbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing emerged victorious over its French rival Airbus at the 2023 Dubai Air Show. The four-day show showcased a robust demand for wide-body jets, marking a significant comeback for Boeing after years of grappling with major safety scandals.

Boeing’s triumph in Dubai was evident from the outset, with the American planemaker securing a staggering 295 aircraft orders by the fourth day.

In contrast, Airbus lagged with 86 orders, facing public concerns over the cost and performance of the Rolls-Royce engines that power its Airbus A350 wide-body aircraft.

Emirates: Star of the Show

The show started with a bang on day one, as Emirates, Dubai’s flag carrier, placed a monumental order for 95 Boeing 777X jets, totaling an astronomical $52 billion at list prices.

This was followed by a substantial $11 billion order from Emirates subsidiary FlyDubai for 30 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, marking the carrier’s first-ever order for this model.

The Emirates order comprised 55 777-9s and 35 777-8s, totaling 205 units of the 777X wide-body jets. The Dubai-based giant also increased its order of 787 Dreamliners from 30 to 35.

The airline demonstrated continued trust in Boeing with a monumental order, despite the 777X program facing delays and deliveries not starting until 2025.

The endorsement from Emirates highlights increasing international travel demand with emphasis on wide-body jets, suggesting a positive outlook for long-haul air travel and the Middle East’s role in driving demand for these aircraft models.

Other Significant Boeing Orders

Following Emirates, Turkish-German airline SunExpress made the second-largest Boeing order, securing 56 narrow-body 737-8s and 34 737-10s.

Ethiopian Airlines followed suit with orders for 41 737-8s and 26 787-9 Dreamliners.

FlyDubai, SCAT Airlines, Royal Jordanian, and Royal Air Maroc also contributed to Boeing’s success with orders for 30 787-9s, seven 737-8s, and four and two 787-9s, respectively.

Airbus Orders

In contrast, Airbus faced an uphill sales battle at the Dubai Air Show. While the manufacturer secured 86 aircraft orders, it grappled with ongoing deal talks and criticism of the Rolls-Royce engines that come with its A350 variants.

On day two of the show, Air Baltic, the Latvian flag carrier, placed an order for 30 Airbus A220-300 narrow-body planes, along with an option to purchase an additional 20.

Ethiopian Airlines, one of Africa’s leading airlines, also ordered 11 Airbus A350-900 jets, while EgyptAir purchased 10 of the same model.

Emirates followed with an order for 15 Airbus A350-900 planes. The airline claims that the value of this order is around $6 billion. However, the president of Emirates, Sir Tim Clark, voiced his concerns regarding the cost and maintenance of the Rolls-Royce engines which are used in the Airbus A350 planes.

This criticism resulted in a smaller-than-expected order. Rolls-Royce defended its A350-900’s XWB-84 engine, asserting its efficiency, durability, and reliability.

Airbus, which had traditionally dominated at previous Dubai shows, now trailed behind Boeing.

Turkish Airlines Deal Talks

However, in anticipation of the Dubai Air Show, many expected Airbus to make a big sale to Turkish Airlines, with a whopping 355 planes expected to be sold.

However, instead of a signed agreement, both parties announced that they had reached an “agreement in principle for a significant commercial aircraft order,” meaning that discussions are ongoing.

Had this order been fulfilled, it would have placed Airbus in a much more competitive position against its forever rival in Dubai.

Boeing’s Resurgence: What Next?

Boeing’s positive performance at the Dubai Air Show marked a remarkable turnaround. The company’s orders nearly tripled compared to the 2021 show and approached its total from the Paris Air Show 2023.

This success was significant for Boeing, considering its challenging history, particularly following the two catastrophic crashes of its 737 MAX jets in 2019.

The Middle East’s most significant aviation event showcased Boeing’s triumphs and hinted at future market trends. Saudi Arabia’s newest airline, Riyadh Air, expressed interest in making a narrow-body purchase, although nothing materialized during the show.

Additionally, low-cost Saudi carrier Flyadeal is considering ordering approximately 150 more narrow-body jets. These potential purchases underscore the continued growth and dynamism of the aviation industry in the region.

The 2023 Dubai Airshow proved pivotal for Boeing, marking its resurgence and dominance over Airbus. The overwhelming demand for wide-body jets, as evidenced by the massive orders, reflects the optimism in Dubai for long-haul air travel and solidifies the region’s importance in shaping the future of the aviation industry.

As Boeing celebrates its triumph, Airbus faces challenges and ongoing discussions, emphasizing the competitive nature of the aerospace market.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999912977218628}",positive,0.9999912977218628,1
Airbus: Moving forward together - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 16 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1tb3ZpbmctZm9yd2FyZC10b2dldGhlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This sponsored article was created by Insight magazine, the sponsored content division of MHM Publishing, on behalf of Airbus.

Airbus strives to be a reliable partner to its 3,000 customers in 152 countries, supporting the flight activity of over 12,000 helicopters in service, often performing critical missions.

In a world where that activity is picking up in complex and uncertain times, being able to reach everywhere in record time with tailor-made capabilities is an essential criteria. Innovation and transformation are at the heart of Airbus Helicopters’ strategy to anticipate these changes.

Our customers’ operational environments are ever-evolving, and we make it our mission to provide those who serve, protect, save lives and safely carry passengers in demanding environments with best-in-class solutions that answer their superior requirements.

The versatile H160, our EMS workhorses, the H135 and H145, and our latest flying laboratory, the DisruptiveLab, are but a few examples of how we turn these challenges into opportunities to equip our customers with the highest levels of performance and reliability in operation, whilst supporting them in reducing their environmental footprint.

The H160 receives FAA certification

Set to perform a wide array of operations, Airbus Helicopters’ next-generation rotorcraft, the H160, has been selected by operators in all mission segments.

The rotorcraft’s capabilities are already supporting customers in Japan, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and Europe, and the fleet has accumulated more than 2,200 flight hours for operations as varied as electronic news gathering, public service, private and business aviation or law enforcement.

Overall, Airbus Helicopters has received orders for more than 100 H160s from customers around the world, including more than a dozen from U.S. customers.

Marking a new milestone in the journey of the H160, the helicopter was certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) earlier this year, enabling Airbus Helicopters to start deliveries to U.S. customers who had already selected the rotorcraft.

Customers can expect a seamless entry of the H160 into the North American market, with many years of work already dedicated to ensuring a smooth transition. This includes the addition of North America’s first H160 Level D full flight simulator, which is expected to be available for use in Grand Prairie, Texas, as early as the second half of 2025.

Essential partners for essential missions

Incremental innovation is our motto. We make sure our whole range provides customers with the necessary efficiency to perform their essential missions.

Our H135 and H145 are testament to this commitment, with their custom features designed to enhance operational capabilities. For instance, the Bavarian police’s fully-equipped H145s will feature a state-of-the-art computer system with tactical police mission software, easily operated by a foldable flat screen mission command station for an operator in the cabin and a stowable monitor for the copilot.

The crew will be aided by a modern lighting concept and leading-edge camera solutions, offering better situational awareness of the helicopter’s surroundings and events on the ground. Additional features, such as illuminated blade tips, improve the safety on board during essential police operations.

True workhorses for multiple mission segments, including for emergency medical services, law enforcement and energy, as well as military applications, the H135 and H145 are proven helicopter types that have respectively clocked in nearly 6.5 and 7 million flight hours, demonstrating that they’re trusted partners for operators.

The 1,500th H135 was delivered to German EMS specialist ADAC Luftrettung in August 2023, whilst the five-bladed version of the H145 continues to be a successful addition to our customers’ fleets.

Pioneering disruption

To prepare the fleet of tomorrow, Airbus Helicopters is working on the technologies that will equip customers with the means to increase their rotorcraft’s performance whilst contributing to lower carbon operations.

A key driver to reach this goal, our DisruptiveLab is a flying laboratory that is designed to test new aerodynamic features and flight technologies to help reduce CO2 emissions by up to 50 percent. The demonstrator held its maiden flight in January 2023 and is set to undergo a series of ground and flight tests to measure the consolidated impact of the new features it is testing.

Another key stream in our innovation roadmap is autonomy, and specifically the Vertex system that has been introduced onboard the FlightLab demonstrator.

Vertex is an Airbus UpNext and Airbus Helicopters project destined to test autonomous flight features to simplify mission management and help reduce pilot workload through innovative devices such as LiDAR sensors, fly-by-wire technology and Eagle, our real-time onboard image processing system. The results of the tests will be integrated into the design of CityAirbus NextGen’s simplified flight controls.

Ready when you are

Once ready for operations, we also make sure to provide our customers with the highest quality services to support them and their fleet. 2023 is shaping out to be a successful year for our support and services offering, with an increasing number of HCare customers, demonstrating the value-add of tailor-made service packages for operators.

The 360-degree full-motion virtual reality simulator designed with Loft Dynamics is already a favorite amongst H125 operators and we are currently co-developing a version for the H145. The H125 training device is expected to receive FAA certification in the coming months, making it perfectly suited for US customers who are looking for a compact training solution and realistic flight behavior.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.999405026435852}",positive,0.999405026435852,1

"Pontifications: Airbus ponders A330neo MRTT, Boeing ponders KC-46A re-engine - Leeham News and Analysis","Tue, 28 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMy8xMS8yOC9wb250aWZpY2F0aW9ucy1haXJidXMtcG9uZGVycy1hMzMwbmVvLW1ydHQtYm9laW5nLXBvbmRlcnMta2MtNDZhLXJlLWVuZ2luZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Scott Hamilton

Nov. 28, 2023, © Leeham News: In a reversal of intent, the airplane that Airbus may submit to the US Air Force for the next round of aerial tanker procurement may be based on the A330neo instead of the current production A330-200ceo MRTT.

The Air Force, however, may forego competition between Airbus and Boeing and place a sole-source follow-on order with Boeing for the KC-46A tanker, based on the 767-200ER. Boeing already has a contract for 179 KC-46As, and the USAF appears to be leaning toward a sole-source award. Political pressure from Airbus partisans and others who favor competition may prevail.

Related articles

Airbus wants to discontinue production of the A330-200ceo-based MRTT. The neo-based version would be based on the A330-800. Sales of the -800 are poor—fewer than 20 have been ordered. An -800 based MRTT will breathe life into the nearly still-born model.

Boeing considers re-engining the 767-300ERF and the KC-46A.

KC-46A, 767-200, A330 MRTT exempt from 2027 ICAO standards.

Advantages for a neo MRTT

Airbus’ A330 program was launched in the early 1990s. While a full decade newer than the technology in the competing 767, the KC-46A—while based on the still-dominate technology of the 767-300ER—incorporates a glass cockpit, elements from the 767-400, and other modern-day technology.

The A330-200 MRTT uses old-technology GE CF6 engines. Boeing’s KC-46A uses old technology Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines. The A330-800 has a modern wing and Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines. This engine is based on the Trent 1000 developed for the Boeing 787. The 7000 uses bleed air while the 1000 is an electrical-system engine.

Before Lockheed Martin Co. (LMCO) withdrew from its partnership to offer the MRTT to the USAF, Lockheed was the lead with the USAF. LMCO told LNA that the prospect of offering a neo-based MRTT was unlikely, as it would add years to the development time. LMCO subsequently announced that GE would once again provide the CF6 for submission to the USAF. It’s unclear whether LMCO will have a role as a contractor to Airbus in any submission.

An MRTT based on the neo will offer substantially better fuel economy than the ceo-based MRTT. During the competition between Airbus and Boeing resulting in the 2011 award to Boeing, the latter asserted the 767-200ER-based tanker had 26% lower operating and maintenance costs than the larger A330-based tanker. The Boeing tanker did indeed have an operating cost advantage, though not as wide as Boeing claimed.

Boeing considers re-engining the 767F and KC-46A

Boeing could re-engine the 767-300ER freighter and the KC-46A. There is no technical reason why the GEnx engine developed in competition with the Trent 1000 for the 787 couldn’t be installed on the airplanes. The larger-diameter GEnx vs the PW 4000 presents a “fit” issue under the wing, as was the case for the CFM LEAP engine for the Boeing 737 MAX vs the CFM56 installation on the preceding 737NG.

Unlike re-engining the 737, however, doing so on the 767 is easier (though not “easy”). The taller landing gear for the 767-400 and wing box could be installed on the 767-300ER and KC-46A, LNA is told. A GEnx-powered KC-46A would lower the fuel consumption and remain competitive with a Trent-powered A330neo MRTT. But the USAF would lose commonality with the PW4000. And, we’re told, the GEnx ideally should fit through the main-deck cargo door on the KC-46A to carry spare engines to the field, instead of requiring a Boeing C-17 to transport the engine.

LNA is told that the USAF has been asked about the prospect of a KC-46A re-engine, but so far remains cool to the idea.

Re-engining 767 not a new idea

Re-engining the 767 is not a new idea. Boeing studied the prospect multiple times previously and each time rejected it. But now, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 2017 adopted emissions standards that take effect in 2027. Aircraft in production from 2028 must meet the standards, which must be adopted by individual governments to be effective. Production must cease on airplanes that don’t meet the standards. The 767-300ER doesn’t meet them. Turbofans and certain turbojets and Boeing 747-400s, 757s, 767-200s and 777s, McDonnell-Douglas MD-11s, and Canadair Regional Jets are exempt from the proposed regulations.

The 1944 Convention on International Civil Aviation, including the technical standards in its annexes, does not apply to military operations. This means the KC-46A and A330-200 MRTT are unaffected by the new standards despite being based on civilian airliners.

The US is going through the process of adopting the standards. The 767-200ER is excluded from compliance, while the 767-300ER is not. With cargo carriers FedEx and UPS heavily reliant on the 767-300ERF, Boeing has three choices: apply for an exemption (which it has); cease production; or re-engine the airplane. FedEx and UPS currently have 767-300ERF orders with deliveries scheduled into 2025. FedEx has options for delivery into 2026.

FedEx likes the airplane and wants to see it continue production past 2027. Boeing has considered building 767 whitetails before production must cease and delivering them later to FedEx and UPS, assuming pre-agreements and orders or options. Boeing now has plenty of experience in building new airplanes and delivering them years later: consider the MAX, the 777X, and the 787.

A FedEx official is doubtful Congress will grant an exemption for the 767-300ERF to be built beyond 2027, given the current political environment.

Keeping costs low for KC-46A

Extending production of the freighter would help keep costs low for the tanker, FedEx Chairman Fred Smith told me in September 2022. The current orders for tankers extend into 2027. Letters of Intent to order show delivery dates of 2032. A follow-on order would go beyond that date.

These three additional H145s bring the total number of Airbus helicopters in service with the Lithuanian government to eleven, further strengthening Airbus Helicopters’ position in this mission segment. The helicopters will be operated for a wide range of missions including search and rescue, disaster relief and medevac, border patrol, firefighting, transport of donor organs, and operational deployment of the Lithuanian Special Forces.

“We are allocating significant resources to provide our State Border Guard Service with state-of-the-art equipment such as the multi-mission H145 helicopters,” said Agné Bilotaité, the Lithuanian Minister of Interior. “Funded in part by the national budget and also thanks to European funding, the H145s will further strengthen the intelligence and response capabilities of our border guards and contribute to Lithuania’s security,” she added.

“We are honoured that the Lithuanian State Border Guard Service is placing its trust in Airbus Helicopters once again with the selection of the H145 as its next generation multi-role helicopter,” said Olivier Michalon, Executive Vice President Global Business for Airbus Helicopters. “Our partnership started in 2002 when the Lithuanian State Border Guard received their first EC120. Twenty-one years later, it is a privilege to support such a distinguished organisation and to contribute to essential security missions in order to protect and serve the population of Lithuania and to make Europe safer,"" he added.

There are more than 200 helicopters of the H145 helicopter family deployed to public services and law enforcement missions all around the world.

The new version of Airbus’ best-selling H145 adds a new, innovative five-bladed rotor to the multi-mission H145, increasing the useful load of the helicopter by 150 kg. The simplicity of the new bearingless main rotor design will also ease maintenance operations, further improving the benchmark serviceability and reliability of the H145, while improving ride comfort for both passengers and crew.

In total, there are more than 1,650 H145 family helicopters in service, logging a total of more than 7.5 million flight hours. Powered by two Safran Arriel 2E engines, the H145 is equipped with full authority digital engine control (FADEC) and the Helionix digital avionics suite. It includes a high performance 4-axis autopilot, increasing safety and reducing pilot workload. Its particularly low acoustic footprint makes the H145 the quietest helicopter in its class, while its CO2 emissions are the lowest amongst its competitors.

This contract includes a total of nine systems, each consisting of three unmanned aerial vehicles and one ground control station. Furthermore, two simulators will be supplied to train the Spanish Armed Forces.

“This new technological milestone in the tactical UAS segment together with the Spanish Ministry of Defence, will reinforce national sovereignty. SIRTAP will be fully developed in Spain, integrating national capabilities. However, thanks to its versatility and the use of ITAR-free components, we also expect it to play a key role on the international market,” said Jean-Brice Dumont, Head of Military Air Systems at Airbus Defence and Space.

SIRTAP, with a payload of more than 150kgs, has been designed for advanced surveillance, intelligence and reconnaissance missions, both over land and at sea. A range of more than 2,000km and an endurance of more than 20 hours will provide high flexibility and reactivity, allowing for day and night operations in the most demanding environments. The system will be certified to fly in segregated airspace.

In the future, this tactical UAS will be able to operate jointly with other platforms to be integrated into a system of systems. The development of SIRTAP will bring the national industry key experience and competences in the field of Remote Carriers for FCAS.

First flight of the SIRTAP prototype is expected to take place in 2025.

"H145M: One helicopter, many missions - Airbus","Mon, 13 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTExLWgxNDVtLW9uZS1oZWxpY29wdGVyLW1hbnktbWlzc2lvbnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In an increasingly uncertain world, militaries are looking for proven battlefield solutions to make a decisive impact. As a former captain in German army aviation with 12 years of experience, including tours of service in Afghanistan and a degree in mechanical engineering, H145M programme manager Constance Pinsdorf tells Rotor why this helicopter makes a difference in theatres of combat worldwide.

What are the advantages of the H145M?

Constance Pinsdorf: From search and rescue to light attack, armed escort to VIP and troop transport to training, the sheer variety of operations that the H145M performs is its key strength. One helicopter can fulfill many missions and can even be converted to implement a new role in just one hour. Connectivity is also a key strength, as is the digitalisation of the battlefield and the interoperability with ground forces—therefore the H145M is ready to handle datalinks like VMF (a kind of “whatsapp” for soldiers) or Link 16 and can display this information in a digital battlefield system directly inside the cockpit.

Of course the range of weaponry that the H145M can integrate increases the scope of missions that it can perform. HForce [modular weaponry] is very flexible in terms of integrating whichever weapons a customer might want, allowing operators to choose different options. The H145M offers both unguided and laser guided rockets, as well as 20mm cannon and 12.7mm gun. The main difference, compared to some of its competitors, is the Spike ER2, which has a firing range of up to 16 km, if controlled via radio frequency, or 10km, if controlled via fibre optic—depending on a customer’s operations. This allows the helicopter to eliminate targets from a distance without encountering enemy fire.

The H145M has performed lots of exercises for Manned Unmanned Teaming. Are there aspects of this helicopter that make it particularly suitable for this kind of interoperability?

Constance Pinsdorf: It is important for us to be unprejudiced and flexible in the platforms used for communication with drones. We are open to working with several kinds of platforms and we have already handled two drones in parallel. For these capabilities it’s essential to have an algorithm that can handle a drone by itself and supports the operator, so the crew won’t have to contend with additional workload; doing the mission and in parallel handling the drone. Therefore we are happy to have a strong partner who is working with us developing these algorithms. The next step should be the ALE capability (Air Launched Effects)—starting a drone, or drones, directly from the helicopter, not from the ground. We know for sure that we can handle one drone and even two different types of drone in parallel but if we have five, six, …eight drones—strong algorithms that are really mature become even more important.

The H145M is based on a civil helicopter - is it battlefield proven?

Constance Pinsdorf: Absolutely. It’s no secret that the H145M went to Afghanistan and Niger. It is militarily proven. We are in close contact with military regiments to understand how the helicopters were used and what can be improved (as a next step). The H145M is much more than a civil helicopter—we simply used civil advantages and merged them with military needs like installing a self-protection system [Electronic warfare system (EWS)] which includes laser-, radar- and missile-warners on board; LAPKs [light armament protection kits against 7.62mm] for the pilot, copilot and cabin; helmet mounted side displays; self-sealing supply tanks; encrypted communication and further capabilities. The H145M is much more than a civil helicopter with attached weapons.

The fact that everything is qualified and battlefield proven is a big advantage for the H145M. We are convinced that we made the right steps to find new serialised versions for future capabilities, which can be offered and delivered in upcoming contracts.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9276539087295532}",neutral,0.9276539087295532,0

Airbus will create a range of facilities at its 14 acre site available to new and existing space players to encourage growth in the wider space ecosystem. The new Space Catalyst will be part of Airbus’ Community for Space Prosperity (CUSP) programme which aims to grow the activity of the UK space supply chain, research and outreach activities.

Ben Bridge, Chairman of Airbus Defence and Space UK said: “We have always been committed to encouraging new entrants into the UK’s vibrant space economy, and this award will enable us to take it to the next level. By building dedicated facilities at our Stevenage headquarters, new and existing space players will be able to take advantage of the laboratories, test facilities and existing infrastructure and tap into the expertise of the 1,200 skilled workforce based on site, further strengthening the UK’s sovereign space capability.”

Dr Paul Bate, Chief Executive of the UK Space Agency, said: “This is an exciting opportunity for Airbus to create a range of new space facilities in Stevenage to support the wider sector, as part of its Community for Space Prosperity (CUSP) programme. Infrastructure like this will help ensure the UK stays at the forefront of international space missions and fosters advanced capabilities, generating more opportunities for business, suppliers and researchers, and inspiring the future workforce.

“The Space Clusters Infrastructure Fund highlights the government’s commitment to space and will help deliver the goal set out in the National Space Strategy to build one of the most innovative and attractive space economies in the world, developing new skills and creating jobs.”

UKSA launched its Space Clusters and Infrastructure Fund (SCIF) competition in May 2023. In total, UKSA is awarding more than £47m to fund new initiatives and broaden the UK’s industrial space based economy. The latest figures from UKSA show the UK space industry is worth more than £17.5 billion a year to the economy.

Airbus has launched the Community for Space Prosperity (CUSP) as an initiative which brings together all the various activities and opportunities that Airbus has for the Space industry in the UK under one approach. CUSP has been designed as an open and inclusive community, with opportunities for suppliers, researchers and those joining the Space industry. Airbus wants to ensure that it continues to grow the Space industry in the UK.

Airbus’ plans include creating a series of laboratories for a range of disciplines including robotics, flat satellites, digital twins, cyber etc, which will be available for use by companies in the sector. This would enable innovative hardware to be rapidly matured and de-risked with all facilities connected to enable demonstration of a full mission.

The facilities will also include a high-tech lab space for collaborative work, or stand-alone industrial use on Virtual and Augmented Reality, enabling new missions to be played and scenario planning. It is expected to attract companies in areas as diverse as space robotics, remote sensing, planetary sciences, climate change, electric aviation, and mixed autonomy traffic operations among others.

The space catalyst will also have the opportunity to link with the Stevenage Bio Science Catalyst to advance space base bioscience research and commercialisation.

This new order will take the airline’s total firm orderbook to 80 aircraft.

Already operating a 44 strong fleet of A220-300s, airBaltic is currently the largest A220-300 operator in the world.



The airline’s history with the Airbus A220-300 dates back to 2016 where it was the launch customer, and in 2020, it refreshed its fleet to solely operate this aircraft type.



“This day marks a significant milestone in the history of airBaltic – our plans for the first time ever to operate a fleet of 100 aircraft by 2030. For almost seven years already, the Airbus A220-300 has been the backbone of our operations and has played an integral role in the international success story of airBaltic”, said Martin Gauss, President and CEO of airBaltic. “Being the global launch customer of the Airbus A220-300, we continue to be a proud ambassador of it. We are grateful to our partners at Airbus for the incredible support, trust, and collaboration over these years.”



“Thank you to airBaltic for being such an ambassador for the A220 with this repeat order. The A220 has been the instrument for airBaltic in its success and growth thus far and we are particularly proud to be extending this partnership well into the future with this latest order”, said Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer and Head of International. “The A220 offers a unique capability in terms of range, performance, and not to forget, passenger appeal. It is a gamechanger for our customers in this important market segment, which we are serving with less fuel-burn, lower emissions and noise, making the A220 a global citizen of choice.”

The A220-300 is the most modern airliner in its size category, carrying between 120 to 150 passengers on flights of up to 3,450 nautical miles (6,390 km). The aircraft offers 25% lower fuel burn and CO2 emissions per seat compared to previous generation aircraft. It also has the largest cabin, seats and windows in its class, ensuring superior comfort.



As with all Airbus aircraft, the A220 is already able to operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Airbus aims for all its aircraft to be capable of operating with 100% SAF by 2030.

As at the end of October, Airbus won close to 820 orders from around 30 customers for the A220, of which more than 295 have been delivered, including 50 deliveries so far in 2023. The A220 is already in successful service with 17 airlines worldwide on 1,350+ routes.

The NH90 in Spain: The family keeps growing - Airbus,"Wed, 15 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTExLXRoZS1uaDkwLWluLXNwYWluLXRoZS1mYW1pbHkta2VlcHMtZ3Jvd2luZ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With more than 10,000 flight hours under its belt, the NH90 has provided the Spanish Army and Air Force with new capabilities, fleet rationalisation and safety improvements. The deliveries of the second batch beginning in 2024 will also equip the Navy with the most modern amphibious helicopter ever operated in Spain.

Spain’s close relationship with the NH90 began in 2006, when the Spanish Ministry of Defence purchased its first batch of NH90s. A total of 15 helicopters were ordered for the Spanish Army and six for the Spanish Air Force, all of which have now been delivered. With the aim of continuing to renew its tactical helicopters, in 2018 Spain gave the green light for a second batch of 23 NH90s. On this occasion, it also included the development and production of seven naval MSPT (Maritime Spanish Tactical Transport Helicopter) variants to equip the Spanish Navy with multi-purpose tactical transport helicopters capable of operating in low visibility or adverse weather conditions and at night. It is also fitted to perform combat search and rescue (CSAR), medical evacuation and logistic transport missions if required. The first MSPT will begin the customisation phase in Spain in accordance with the requirements of the Ministry of Defence (DGAM) in the coming weeks.

The Sarrios of the Spanish Army

The incorporation in 2014 of the NH90 by the Spanish Army, which dubbed it the Sarrio, enabled a significant gain in effectiveness for tactical transport, aerial assault and special operations in demanding conditions. General Pablo Muñoz Bermudo, General of the FAMET, had the following to say regarding the incorporation of the NH90: “The introduction of the NH90 as a high-performance tactical helicopter has allowed a quantum leap in both our capabilities and the safety of army personnel. It has proven itself to be highly reliable in flight in hostile environments, as we recently saw during their deployment in Mali. The FAMET is looking to progressively integrate this helicopter with the army’s other weapons systems in order to provide an effective response on all the missions we carry out.” New mission systems have also been progressively incorporated to optimise its features (ballistics protection, roller loading system, 12.7mm machine guns, electronic warfare (EW) system, rappel and fast rope systems and a cargo hook).

Six wolves in Madrid

The six NH90s based with the 48th Wing of the Spanish Air Force in Madrid carry out missions such as personnel recovery, combat rescue and special operations. They may also be called upon to carry out medical evacuations and SAR missions. “The step up from the Super Puma to the NH90 has been significant in terms of speed (from 120 to 150 knots), load capacity (500 kg more), flight time (up to 5 hours compared to the 3.5 hours of the Super Puma) and of course range (430 NM instead of the 220 NM previously without optional equipment),” explains Major Cristina Pampliega, Commander of the 803rd Squadron. At the end of September, the ‘wolves’ of the Spanish Air Force as they are known reached 3,000 flight hours. According to Major Pampliega, “We’ve reached our operational capacity in the three main roles: Personnel Recovery, Special Aerial Operations and SAR/MEDEVAC Missions.” The unit also forms part of the NATO Response Force (NRF) for Special Operations. Based on a rotational system, NATO allies commit their units to the NRF for a period of 12 months, during which they may be rapidly deployed to wherever they may be required.

Spanish NH90s are being prepared to take part in the European Union Training Mission in Mali in the near future.



The first NH90 for the Spanish Navy in 2024

The first NH90 to be delivered to the Spanish Navy, the MSPT, will be the best amphibious helicopter the navy has ever had and will significantly enhance its strategic capabilities. The MSPT is an evolution of the GSPA (Ground Spain Army) Standard 3 version operated by the Spanish Army. It has new reinforced landing gear, a maximum take-off weight of up to 11 tonnes, integration of an automatic identification system (AIS) for vessel/helicopter tracking and an automatic blade and tail folding system to minimise flight deck time and enhance safety for on-board technicians. What’s more, with the deliveries of the H135 to the navy beginning now in autumn, this twin-engine light helicopter will be of major assistance for training given that the Helionix avionics system integrated in the H135 is very similar to that of the NH90.

The NH90 HSPN: Made in Spain

Airbus Helicopters has proposed a national solution to the Spanish Ministry of Defence for the development of the new anti-submarine helicopter for the navy, the NH90 HSPN, which will continue the efforts being made to harmonise the fleets of the three branches of the armed forces. In keeping with the guidelines of the Defence Industrial Strategy 2023 aimed at strengthening and consolidating the national defence industry, the development studies for the HSPN propose a sovereign solution, with Airbus Helicopters acting as coordinator of other Spanish defence companies such as Indra, Tecnobit and Navantia. As well as ensuring national industrial involvement and support, the HSPN will be a modern, fully tested and certified product that is already used by a number of Spain’s international allies such as Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. It may be deployed by the Spanish Navy in multiple scenarios.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995794892311096}",neutral,0.9995794892311096,0

The maiden flight occurred at Airbus Helicopters’ production facility in Donauwörth, Germany. The aircraft will now enter a qualification phase that includes flight testing with newly installed systems before deliveries begin by the end of 2025.

The aircraft is the newest variant of the Airbus NH90 naval helicopter, which is already in use in six countries for search and rescue and military operations. The Sea Tiger variant designed for the German military is equipped with anti-submarine warfare technology including a dipping sonar, sonobuoys, and weapons, such as torpedoes and missiles for engaging targets above and below the surface.

In 2020, Germany’s military, known as Bundeswehr, ordered 31 NH90 Sea Tigers for the German Navy to replace its aging fleet of Mk88A Sea Lynx. The military already operates 18 NH90 Sea Lion naval transport helicopter variants, Airbus said.

“Operating both the NH90 Sea Lion and the Sea Tiger will allow the Navy to further streamline its operations and maintenance,” said Stefan Thomé, managing director of Airbus Helicopters in Germany. “The NH90 Sea Lion, which is already in service with the Navy, has recently proven its capabilities during a first major rescue operation in the North Sea.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999756813049316}",neutral,0.9999756813049316,0

Emirates puts off Airbus purchase - Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette,"Wed, 15 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzL25vdi8xNS9lbWlyYXRlcy1wdXRzLW9mZi1haXJidXMtcHVyY2hhc2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Long-haul carrier Emirates signaled Tuesday that it will hold off on a major order for Airbus A350 aircraft over concerns about their Rolls-Royce engines, marking a blow for the European manufacturer as it hopes to close the sale during the Dubai Air Show this week.

Emirates President Tim Clark's comments to journalists at the show came the day after his airline announced a plan to order $52 billion worth of jetliners from Boeing Co., while its sister airline, FlyDubai, is on the order sheet for another $11 billion of aircraft from Boeing.

Meanwhile, Ethiopian Airlines said it has ordered 31 aircraft from Boeing, including 20 737 MAX aircraft in a sign of renewed confidence in the single-aisle aircraft by the carrier after it suffered a deadly crash in 2019 with the airplane that led to its worldwide grounding.

Airbus has yet to reach a major deal at the show, which comes as global airlines like Emirates have bounced back from the lockdowns of the coronavirus pandemic with increased global demand for travel.

In his comments to journalists on the runway of Al Maktoum International Airport, Clark raised concerns about the maintenance required for the Rolls-Royce engines on the A350.

""If the engine was doing what we want it to do ... then it would re-enter the mix of assessment for our fleet plan,"" Clark said.

Airbus and Rolls-Royce did not immediately respond to a request for comment by The Associated Press.

Emirates is a heavyweight when it comes to East-West travel out of Dubai International Airport, the world's busiest for international travel.

Clark also said Emirates needs to buy aircraft now as it moves forward with plans to expand its routes and networks.

""Irrespective of the difficulties of getting these aircraft out of the door, we have to place orders now because the lead time for deliveries are so long,"" Clark said.

Clark also said the tensions in the wider Middle East sparked by the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip wouldn't affect Emirates' business, adding that the airline is used to working around the region's geopolitical problems. He said although the Israeli market was one of the fastest-growing markets for Emirates, they had to stop their daily flights to Tel Aviv, but that the airline was able to absorb the demand fall-off.

Emirates and FlyDubai started direct flights to Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv after the two countries established diplomatic ties in 2020.

Two major Israeli firms -- Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd. and Israel Aerospace Industries had been slated to participate in the Dubai Air Show. But the IAI stand, bearing the slogan ""Where Courage Meets Technology,"" was roped off and empty Monday. On Tuesday, a few people gathered there.

Also in the market for aircraft is Riyadh Air, a new Saudi carrier being created as part of trillions of dollars worth of spending planned in the kingdom. In March, the airline announced an order of up to 72 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner jetliners and has further plans to expand.

Clark said he wasn't worried about the competition.

""If Saudi Arabia wants to spend $2 trillion on doing wonderful things over there, they've got to have the labor from somewhere. And that labor force has got to be brought in, and their carriers are going to find it difficult in the early stages to meet that demand,"" he said. ""So do I think it's a problem with this lot? No, I don't ... because we managed to build Emirates through all of this competition, rising geopolitical socioeconomic difficulty.""

The air show, which sees billions of dollars worth of orders, as arms manufacturers exhibit at the show, comes two weeks before Dubai hosts the United Nations' COP28 climate talks.

Aviation has particularly drawn the ire of climate change activists, in part because of the amount of jet fuel the industry burns. Emirates in January successfully flew a Boeing 777 on a test flight with one of its two engines entirely powered by so-called sustainable aviation fuel. Earlier this month, the airline cleared SAF for flights, including one to Sydney.

However, ""decarbonizing civil aviation is incredibly difficult and will be long-term,"" Clark said.

On Tuesday, Ethiopian announced its deal with Boeing to purchase 737 MAX aircraft, as well as 11 787 Dreamliners. It also agreed to options to potentially buy another 36 aircraft -- 21 MAX planes and 15 Dreamliners. Boeing described it as ""the largest-ever purchase of Boeing airplanes in African history,"" without offering a sales price for the deal.

The March 2019 MAX crash shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa killed all 157 people on board. It was the second involving a Boeing MAX in less than five months and led to a worldwide grounding of all MAX jets for nearly two years.

Asked about the crash, Ethiopian Group Chief Executive Officer Mesfin Tasew said it ""has left a big scar in our memory.""

""We have checked and confirmed that the design defect of that aircraft has been fully corrected by Boeing and we have renewed our confidence in that aircraft,"" he said.

Other purchases Tuesday included:

Emirates announced $1.2 billion in deals with French firm Safran, including for seats.

Emirates announced plans for a $950 million maintenance facility at Al Maktoum International Airport, the city-state's second airfield.

EgyptAir announced that it would buy 10 Airbus A350-900s. It did not disclose the price of the aircraft.

Boeing and SCAT Airlines of Kazakhstan announced that the airline ordered seven Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. It also did not disclose terms for the sale.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.7457661032676697}",negative,0.7457661032676697,-1
"Airbus To Raise A350 Production, Confirms 2023 Delivery Targets - Aviation Week","Wed, 08 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcmNyYWZ0LXByb3B1bHNpb24vYWlyYnVzLXJhaXNlLWEzNTAtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1jb25maXJtcy0yMDIzLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LXRhcmdldHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FRANKFURT—Backed by several recent major orders for the type, Airbus has decided to increase the production rate of the A350 family further.

The manufacturer confirmed Nov. 8 that monthly output of its most important widebody will increase to 10 aircraft per month in 2026. Airbus also specified the target to bring the A220 up to 14 aircraft per month—a rate now also to be achieved within the next three years.

Airbus delivered 36 A350s in the first 10 months of 2023, an average rate of under four aircraft per month. The program, like the rest of the commercial business, has steep growth ahead of it already: A350 production is expected to more than double between now and the end of 2025 to nine aircraft per month. Rate 10 has already been reached once before in 2015 as part of the manufacturer’s initial ramp-up plan.

Airbus has seen strong sales of the A350 of late. The biggest deals in 2023 include 34 A350-1000s for Air India, 10 for Lufthansa, and 18 for EVA Air. Also, a once-canceled commitment by Qatar Airways for 23 aircraft has been reinstated after the airline and Airbus resolved their dispute over surface degradation in an out-of-court settlement.

Airbus’ decision comes as Boeing is also in the process of boosting 787 output. Its U.S. rival also aims at a rate of 10 aircraft per month in 2025 or 2026. Boeing Commercial Aircraft CEO Stan Deal indicated at the Paris Air Show in June that the company may go even higher if demand justifies the move. Boeing’s highest 787 production was 14 aircraft per month. The manufacturer is also promising its customers that it will begin deliveries of the 777-9 in 2025.

Meanwhile, Airbus appears to have gained confidence in its ability to give more precise guidance on boosting A220 production, too. The OEM had previously guided the market for a rate of 14 per month by the middle of the decade. It now says that level is to be reached in 2026. Airbus is also working toward a rate of 75 A320 family aircraft per month that same year.

Once the growth plan has been achieved, Airbus plans to produce a total of 89 narrowbodies per month, plus 14 widebodies, for a total of over 100 aircraft per month.

The only program for which further production increases are not planned at this time is the A330neo. It is slowly moving up to four aircraft per month in 2024. Airbus delivered 20 A330neos in the first 10 months of 2023.

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said he expects “the supply chain to remain challenging as we progress on the production ramp-up.” The speed of ramp-up is “paced by a few critical suppliers, not only engines.” Despite the issues, Faury is “satisfied with the ramp-up” for the time being. “Q3 was okay, October was good,” Faury said. Airbus delivered 71 aircraft in October.

The company also stuck to its guidance of handing over around 720 aircraft in 2023. Faury pointed to the fact that the company delivered 166 units in the final two months of 2022 and has 161 more to go this year to get to its target. He predicted that the output will be “significantly higher” in 2024, though Airbus will only specify its production plans at the beginning of next year.

The A321XLR will enter service in the second quarter of 2024 after having concluded its route proving campaign.

According to Faury, Airbus is taking “as few engines as possible” to be able to secure the ramp-up, but also allow support of the in-service fleet. He acknowledged that A320neo family customers are going through “a lot of pain” because of the Pratt & Whitney inspection program that will force a large number of aircraft on the ground in the coming months.

Talks with Pratt about 2024 deliveries are ongoing, though the issues the engine manufacturer is dealing with “do not change what we told you for 2023.”

Faury said Airbus was “supporting Spirit [AeroSystems]”—a supplier that has asked for better contract terms for its work shares in the A220 and A350 programs as it orchestrates a financial turnaround. “But we also expect from Spirit to well support Airbus,” Faury added. “After all, we are their customer.”

In the first nine months of the year, Airbus handed over 488 aircraft—51 more than in the first three quarters of 2022. Among them were 41 A220s, 391 A320 family aircraft, 20 A330s, and 36 A350s.

Revenues in Airbus’ commercial aircraft business increased 18% to €31.5 billion ($33.7 billion) based on the higher deliveries. Adjusted earnings before interest and tax (Adjusted EBIT) rose by 11.9% to €3.2 billion, a 10.2% margin.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9996291399002075}",positive,0.9996291399002075,1

The yet-to-be-firmed-up deal is for up to 355 aircraft, 240 of which will be on firm order, according to Turkish Airlines. The flag-carrier said in a filing to the Istanbul stock exchange that “discussions with Airbus … are ongoing.” The aircraft are to be delivered between 2026 and 2036.

“Necessary announcements will be shared with the public following to the Board of Directors' approval,” Turkish stated. Airbus also said that it is “ratifying this agreement and will communicate in the coming days.”

Turkish is understood to be ordering a mix of A321neos and A350s, with the vast majority of the commitment being for the narrowbody. The deal is part of Turkish’s latest strategic plan that foresees the carrier growing its fleet to 800 aircraft by 2033. To achieve this and compensate for retirements on the way, Turkish is looking at ordering a total of 600 aircraft from both Airbus and Boeing. The Boeing part of the fleet investment—understood to be for the 737 MAX, 787 and possibly the 777X—is still under negotiation and is understood to be not quite as far advanced as the Airbus component of the order.

The Turkish agreement is one of two mega-orders Airbus has been expecting for the Dubai Airshow. The other one, a follow-up order by Emirates for more A350, is still hanging in the balance.

Industry sources say Emirates and engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce have yet to come to an understanding over maintenance guarantees for the A350s' Trent XWB engines. Emirates is expecting to take delivery of the first of 50 A350-900s from a previous order in August 2024.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999817609786987}",neutral,0.9999817609786987,0

The agreement, announced on Thursday (Nov. 9), is part of Airbus’ strategy to support Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) growing its footprint in commercial aircraft MRO in India.

The airframe manufacturer says that the building of a new maintenance facility will enable it to support HAL's efforts to service growing MRO demand in India’s expanding commercial fleet focusing particularly on the A320 family aircraft. As part of the agreement, Airbus will provide A320 tooling along with consultancy services to help establish the MRO hangar.

Construction work will commence on the facility in the near future and is expected to be completed by November 2024 after the necessary certifications are obtained from India's regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).

The facility will cater to A320 MRO needs leading to significant decrease in lead time, improving over turnaround time, and MRO cost reduction for Indian operators resulting increased fleet availability as per demand.

Speaking on developing a strong and robust MRO ecosystem in India, Airbus’s president and managing director, Remi Maillard, further stressed the importance of development of a strong MRO infrastructure in India.

This agreement follows a recent order placed by Indian low-cost airline IndiGo for 500 A320 aircraft, taking the total number of Airbus aircraft on order by IndiGo to 1,330 aircraft. Such a large volume of aircraft entering the country's has spurred MRO providers into exploring maintenance opportunities to support the fleet growth. In addition to IndiGo, the likes of Air India and Vistara are other notable A320 customers.

“An indigenous MRO infrastructure will not only help airlines streamline their aircraft operations, but also support the government’s aim of making India a global aviation hub,” adds Maillard. He also believes that state-owned HAL, with its expertise in the aerospace industry, is well positioned to trigger the growth of the commercial MRO sector.

HAL chief executive Saket Chaturvedi, adds that the company aims to provide airlines with ""an effective MRO solution"".

Apart from the tool packages and consultancy needs, Airbus will also offer HAL an access to its AirbusWorld digital platform offering support, technical data and training solutions. Airbus says this will help HAL scale up the operational efficiency of their upcoming MRO facility.

HAL already has a DGCA-approved three-hangar MRO facility in Nashik, Maharashtra with civil MRO capabilities. HAL is also seeking an EASA approval for the facility with the support of Airbus.

HAL has played a prominent role in the Airbus supply chain for several decades, having produced approximately half of the forward passenger doors for the A320 program since the 1990s.

The Indian Government is also encouraging other OEMs to actively participate in its Make-in-India initiative. This includes increasing their sourcing of spares from local repair and spare parts shops and set up MROs and eventually a final assembly line in the country.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999748468399048}",positive,0.9999748468399048,1

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — American aerospace giant Boeing eclipsed its French rival Airbus after four days of deals at the 2023 Dubai Air Show, underlining strong demand for wide-body jets in particular and making a strong comeback after several years of underperformance following major safety scandals. Boeing chalked up 295 aircraft orders in comparison to Airbus' 86 orders by Day 4 of the Middle East's largest aviation event, according to company updates and tallies from industry experts. The French manufacturer grappled with publicly aired concerns over the cost and performance of the Rolls-Royce engines on its planes. Boeing kicked off the first day of the show with a massive order for 90 of its 777 wide-body jets from Dubai's flagship carrier Emirates Airline at list prices of $52 billion, followed by an $11 billion order from Emirates subsidiary and low-cost carrier FlyDubai for 30 of its first-ever-ordered 787 Boeing Dreamliners. The robust appetite for wide-body jets highlighted both Dubai's optimistic outlook for long-haul air travel as well as the importance of the Middle East market to the aircraft model's demand. The purchases showed Dubai flexing its muscles as a leading East-West transit hub, looking keen to defend and increase its market share amid rising competition or expansion from carriers in Turkey, India and Saudi Arabia.

The Emirates order was made up of 55 additional Boeing 777-9s and 35 of its 777-8s, bringing the airline's total orders for the 777X wide-body jets to 205 units. Emirates also updated its order of Boeing 787 Dreamliners from 30 to 35. The significant proportion of wide-body jets at the Dubai show ""reflects the surge in international travel in 2023; and it favors BA (Boeing), which is stronger than Airbus in widebodies and has snared ~50% of the Dubai dollar order value,"" analysts at TD Cowen wrote in a note Wednesday. Turkish-German airline SunExpress made the second-largest Boeing order after Emirates, comprised of 56 of its narrow-body 737-8s and 34 737-10s. Ethiopian Airlines followed with up to 41 737-8s and 26 787-9s, then FlyDubai with 30 787-9s, Kazakhstan's SCAT Airlines with seven 737-8s, and Royal Jordanian and Royal Air Maroc with orders of four and two 787-9s, respectively.

Airbus faces ongoing deal talks, engine criticism

Airbus, which had firmly dominated at the last few Dubai shows, trailed behind with 86 aircraft orders, the largest from AirBaltic which bought 30 narrow-body A220-300s with an option for a further 20. Ethiopian Airlines ordered 11 of Airbus' wide-body A350-900s, while EgyptAir purchased 10 of the same jet.

Emirates on Thursday ordered 15 of the French plane maker's A350-900 jets, a purchase the airline said is worth $6 billion — a much smaller order than previously anticipated, after the carrier's president, Tim Clark, openly criticized the cost and maintenance required for the Rolls-Royce engines on the Airbus A350. ""If the engine was doing what we want it to do ... then it would reenter the mix of assessment for our fleet plan,"" Clark told journalists at the air show. He said that Emirates would have ordered 35-50 of the jets otherwise.

In a statement replying to the comments, Rolls-Royce said that the A350-900's XWB-84 engine ""is the best engine out there when you look at efficiency, durability and reliability."" Industry watchers also anticipated a blockbuster sale for Airbus of 355 planes to Turkish Airlines. But instead of a signing, the two said they reached an ""agreement in principle for a significant commercial aircraft order,"" with the Turkish flag carrier saying in an Istanbul stock exchange filing that its ""discussions with Airbus"" are ""ongoing.""

Boeing orders 'exceeded investor expectations'

Boeing's orders are already nearly three times as high as its total orders from the Dubai Air Show in 2021, and approaching the 356 orders in clinched at the 2023 Paris Air Show in June. Airbus' order figure of 86 aircraft is meanwhile significantly behind its 2023 Paris Air Show haul of 846 orders and 2021 Dubai Air Show total of 408. Before this week, the iconic American manufacturer hadn't enjoyed a winning performance at a Dubai Air Show since 2017. In 2019, Boeing's sales were badly hit after two catastrophic crashes of its popular 737 Max jet in less than five months. Roughly 400 737 Max jets around the world were grounded for nearly two years.

""We believe the Dubai order flows have exceeded investor expectations thus far for Boeing,"" analysts at RBC Capital Markets wrote in a note after the second day of the air show. The analysts still saw potential future orders for Airbus. ""Despite Airbus not yet solidifying its deal with Turkish Airlines, we believe the order activity could be increasing across other airlines,"" RBC wrote on Tuesday.

""Saudi Arabia's newest airline, Riyadh Air, said it could be looking to make a narrowbody purchase, along with [low-cost Saudi carrier] Flyadeal, who could be planning to order about ~150 more"" narrow-body jets, it said. The Middle East's largest aviation event, the Dubai Air Show takes place every two years and this year hosted some 1,400 commercial and military exhibitors from 95 countries, according to its website.

Emirates buys 15 Airbus jets in reprieve from engine row - Fox Business,"Thu, 16 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2VtaXJhdGVzLWJ1eXMtMTUtYWlyYnVzLWpldHMtaW4tcmVwcmlldmUtZnJvbS1lbmdpbmUtcm930gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL21hcmtldHMvZW1pcmF0ZXMtYnV5cy0xNS1haXJidXMtamV0cy1pbi1yZXByaWV2ZS1mcm9tLWVuZ2luZS1yb3cuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus won a consolation order for 15 A350-900 jets from Emirates on Thursday after a public row between the Mideast giant and engine maker Rolls-Royce prevented a bigger deal for European jets at a Dubai Airshow dominated by Boeing.

Emirates Chairman and CEO Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said the long-haul jets would ""add to our fleet mix, and we are pleased to announce additional orders for this aircraft type.""

EMIRATES ORDERS 95 BOEING 777 WIDEBODY JETS IN DEAL WORTH $52B

However, industry sources described the deal as a face-saving compromise after the influential carrier criticized the amount of maintenance needed to keep the engines for the larger A350-1000 flying in hot and sandy conditions of the Gulf.

Sheik Ahmed said Emirates would ""work closely with Airbus and Rolls-Royce to ensure our aircraft deliver the best possible operating efficiency and flying experience for our customers.""

The deal, which Emirates said was worth $6 billion, followed intense negotiations focusing on the needs of the Gulf as it fends off new competition from Turkey, India and elsewhere to its East-West transit model, while shedding light on broader industry tensions over rising engine costs.

ROLLS-ROYCE CUTTING UP TO 2,500 JOBS TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY

Emirates is by far the biggest user of the Airbus A380 after investing heavily in the world's largest airliner, and is now planning the fleet needed to keep its Dubai super-hub at the center of the aviation map beyond the 2030s as the A380 retires.

The airline opened this week's air show with a $52 billion order for 90 Boeing 777X airplanes, saying the U.S. planemaker appeared to be getting a grip on regulatory and other problems surrounding its entry to service after five years of delays.

BOEING SLASHING 737 DELIVERIES ON QUALITY ISSUE

But Emirates Airline President Tim Clark refused to place a large order for Airbus' broadly similar A350-1000 and blasted Rolls-Royce over the disruption and cost of dealing with frequent maintenance needed to keep the plane's engines running.

Emirates would have ordered 35-50 of the planes, he said.

BOEING LOOKING INTO HACKING GANG'S RANSOMWARE THREAT

Rolls-Royce acknowledged its engine for the A350-1000 would need more servicing than Emirates would like, but denied Clark's suggestion that the XWB-97 engine was ""defective.""

Chief Customer Officer Ewen McDonald said deal for the A350-900, which uses a different variant of engine, was a sign of the airline's trust in Rolls-Royce and held out hope for a future order for the A350-1000.

""We will continue our discussions with Emirates on the A350-1000 engine improvements and look forward to them choosing this aircraft in the future,"" he said.

Emirates has already ordered 50 A350-900s which are scheduled to arrive from August next year.

Delegates said earlier a top-up order would be seen as a consolation prize for Airbus and Rolls-Royce after Boeing and its main engine supplier GE. GE. won the majority of deals, but would leave questions over Airbus's ability to compete with Boeing's 777X in the lucrative Gulf market.

""It is...just to keep the relationship going and so they can talk again,"" a senior aviation industry source said.

Investors are expected to quiz Rolls-Royce about the durability and pricing of its engines at a Nov. 28 investor day.

Rolls-Royce said earlier in week it was looking at applying technology from its Ultrafan research project to the XWB-97.

BOEING DOMINATES ORDERS

In a week dominated by soaring demand for wide-body planes, Boeing won new orders for 196 aircraft while Airbus agreed deals for 55 jets.

Airbus said it had reached an ""agreement in principle"" for a significant order from Turkish Airlines, but industry sources said the deal had not yet been signed.

Emirates also agreed to buy five additional 787 Dreamliners, while sister airline flyDubai went for 30 with its first wide-body order.

Although political power is consolidated in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi, Monday's high-profile announcement overseen by Dubai's crown prince was symbolic of the value the UAE places on its bilateral relationship with the United States after a recent period of strain, said sources familiar with the matter.

Future Combat Air System (FCAS) - Enter the Internet of Military Things - Airbus,"Mon, 20 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTExLWZ1dHVyZS1jb21iYXQtYWlyLXN5c3RlbS1mY2FzLWVudGVyLXRoZS1pbnRlcm5ldC1vZi1taWxpdGFyeS10aGluZ3PSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The FCAS Air Combat Cloud will bring real-time intelligence to the forefront by harnessing the networked capabilities of different aircraft and platforms. Innovations in AI, big data processing and cyber will help make defence a truly collaborative mission.

Europe’s Future Combat Air System (FCAS) will see next-generation manned jets flying alongside unmanned remotely piloted carriers of varying sizes. These assets will be part of a fully networked ‘system of systems’ based on open architectures that will allow the integration of other existing platforms such as the A400M or the A330 MRTT tanker. At the heart of this complex system will be the Air Combat Cloud, which will enable these platforms to work together.

FCAS Next-Generation Weapon System (NGWS) with Eurofighter and Remote Carriers

But what exactly is an Air Combat Cloud? As FCAS Combat Cloud Product Solution Lead at Airbus, Ignacio Rosell is often asked this question.

“How does the Android ecosystem work? We have an operating system that allows applications from different parties to be integrated, and all of this is supported by a communications infrastructure such as 5G, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. If we apply this analogy to FCAS, we are developing an important part of the ‘Internet of Military Things’. Our mobile phones could be a fighter aircraft, an unmanned aerial system (UAS), a warship, a satellite, or even a soldier on the ground, each integrating different applications or, in other words, different capabilities. Our air combat cloud has the same components, the communications infrastructure, the operating system and the applications that allow them to operate in a collaborative way,” adds Rosell.

A Europe at the forefront of technology



Launched by France, Germany and Spain, and with Airbus, Dassault Aviation and Indra as national industrial coordinators, FCAS is one of the most important European defence programme of the coming decades. In a context of growing global instability, the aim of the project is nothing less than to design an air defence system that will protect Europe while enhancing its strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty.

Speeding up the cycle with learning technologies



Airbus is leading the Combat Cloud pillar, with Thales and Indra as its main partners. This is one of seven areas of the next-generation FCAS technology (*see infographic below the page), headed at Airbus by Marc Paskowski.

It will provide common situational awareness by instantaneously capturing, sharing, fusing and processing massive amounts of data from all connected manned and unmanned platforms in a trusted manner, and transforming this data into actionable information by leveraging the ever-evolving learning technologies. “The concept based on the air cloud is that all elements must con­stantly interoperate with each other to form a cohesive system that is informed as one and combat as one,"" says Paskowski.

Development work for FCAS Phase 1B is now underway at the Airbus site in Friedrichshafen. This will be followed by Phase 2, culminating in a flight demonstration of the advanced Combat Cloud by around 2028.

“Our ‘operating system’ will need to be an open one to accommodate both off-the-shelf and bespoke applications such as manned-unmanned teaming, from Airbus or from any other industrial partner. It will be an evolutionary one, with new applications such as new aerial platforms being integrated along the way,” says Rosell. “Our business model around the Combat Cloud won’t be unique. An area such as satellite connectivity could be offered as a service, while an ‘app’ part of an aircraft’s mission system could be sold as a product,” he adds.

New Generation Fighter and Remote Carriers demonstrators connected to the Combat Cloud are planned for first flight in 2028/2029

The development of intermediate solutions as part of this ‘internet of military things’ should enable customers to use various levels of cloud capabilities and remote carriers well before FCAS becomes operational in the 2040s. For example, Airbus has already carried out the world’s first successful launch and operation of a Remote Carrier flight test demonstrator from a flying A400M.

For those who secure today and tomorrow: responsible AI for FCAS



Based on this incremental approach, the air combat cloud will be the digital game-changer for the way military operations are conducted.

The ability to integrate, operate and communicate from a networked system will shape the air force of the future.





German Air Force Lieutenant General Ingo Gerhartz

Indeed, future scenarios will require a far higher degree of automation for information management and integration of military services and branches throughout the whole mission cycle. For FCAS, innovations in ‘deep techs’ such as big data processing, artificial intelligence and cyber will provide the advanced intelligence of the cloud, enabling, for example, the distribution of Command and Control (C2) roles, including to the pilot in their fighter, and providing the key players in a mission with all relevant information in real time. “This will give decision makers in the air force an unprecedented level of awareness,” highlights Paskowski.



But with a great power comes great responsibility. With the increasing reliance on artificial intelligence in everything we do as ‘digital citizens’, and the use of platforms such as ChatGPT and its impact in the workplace, the integration of AI at the heart of the FCAS Air Combat Cloud presents new challenges. Questions such as ‘how much will the system support the decision-making process?’ or ’What are the ethical criteria that can be applied to the use of this technology?’

To control or to be controlled: that is the question



In order to anchor ethical questions and legal principles in the FCAS project, Airbus and the Fraunhofer Institute teamed up in 2019 to launch a joint expert commision on the responsible use of technologies (link). It brings together stakeholders from the German Air Force with universities, research institutes and a broad cross-section of foundations, social science and engineering science design experts.



Building on this guidance, within the FCAS Air Combat Cloud, AI will provide analysis of complex situations during multi-domain operations and recommend the smartest action in the right sequence. The human will then validate the recommendations. If the operational tempo is high, the human will instead simply decide whether or not to veto the recommendations, and the subsequent processes will again be automated by the AI. “Our European air defence system will be under the full control of a responsible human operator at all times and in all circumstances,” concludes Marc Paskowski.

Both technologically and militarily, the development of FCAS has the potential to set new standards and revolutionise the use of air power.

The use of AI at Airbus

Airbus began integrating AI into its products and solutions in the 1990s, with applications for reading and interpreting satellite imagery. The OneAtlas imagery services harnesses the power of Airbus’ constellation of optical and radar satellites with trusted AI and cloud technology to provide key insights for example for combating deforestation, optimising agricultural yields and urban planning.



Meanwhile, in the aeronautical sector, Airbus’ Skywise big data platform collects data from 24,000 aircraft parameters, enabling airlines subscribing to the service to carry out predictive maintenance and improve the overall operational efficiency of their fleets.

Technological pillars of FCAS programme

The FCAS programme comprises a total of seven main development areas.

Airbus Performs Autonomous Vertex Flight Tests - Aviation Week,"Mon, 27 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvZW1lcmdpbmctdGVjaG5vbG9naWVzL2FpcmJ1cy1wZXJmb3Jtcy1hdXRvbm9tb3VzLXZlcnRleC1mbGlnaHQtdGVzdHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters has completed initial flight tests of an autonomous rotorcraft flight control system that can be controlled entirely through a tablet computer.

The OEM’s three-year Vertex project—supported by Airbus’ UpNext innovation arm and jointly funded by France’s Civil Aviation Authority—has demonstrated fully autonomous flight, including takeoff, cruise, approach and landing.

The efforts are initially focused around improving safety in light helicopter operations, as well as paving the way toward autonomous operation of electric advanced air mobility systems.

“The goal of the demonstrator was to show how we can simplify the mission from the preparation to control, reducing the workload and increasing safety and the autonomy of the helicopter,” Alexandre Gierczynski, program lead for the Vertex project, tells Aerospace Daily.

Flight testing has been performed with Airbus Helicopters FlightLab H130 technology demonstrator aircraft. The same aircraft has recently been used to demonstrate control of the helicopter using a single stick—replacing the cyclic, collective and pedal inputs/controls.

To enable Vertex, the aircraft is equipped with a four-axis autopilot, a gimbaled electro-optical camera and Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) sensor, connected to a high-power onboard computer.

The primary interface for the pilot is a tablet computer and a small flight information display fitted in front of the pilot. As part of Vertex’s development, engineers designed an entirely new human-machine interface, with basic flight information including altitude, track and speed overlaid on synthetic terrain provided through a database.

On the tablet, a series of contextual buttons changes depending on the mission profile. The use of the Lidar provides information on potential obstacles, such as electric wires, and supports a collision-avoidance capability. The gimbal camera allows the pilot to identify potential landing zones and can cue the control system to perform an approach into that landing zone, advancing the company’s internally developed Eye for Augmented Guidance for Landing Extension (EAGLE) system.

Whenever necessary, the pilot can easily override the controls through the tablet and resume the mission afterward.

The system also leans on the four-axis autopilot to provide a level of flight envelope protection, while the engines are also managed by the autopilot.

Combined with highly accurate navigation systems, the autopilot also enables operation in confined areas, such as automated hover taxiing at airports.

During the flights between Marseille-Provence International Airport and the nearby Aix-en-Provence airfield using pre-defined routes, the system would keep the helicopter hover taxiing at the airports constantly within a corridor just 2 m (6 ft.) wide, Gierczynski says.

Other systems developed include what Gierczynski calls a “smart radio,” which changes radio frequency communication to the most likely required frequencies depending on the location of the aircraft.

“Radio management in a very dense area can represent up to 8% of the pilot workload,” Gierczynski says. Instead, the smart radio “pre-selects frequencies … and automatically switches to those you have to use in that region.”

Engineers also added a function that would enable an emergency landing, with the system proposing areas to make a safe landing—which is then validated by the pilot.

First flights with the Vertex system began in July, although the system was initially flown uncoupled to the autopilot. The first coupled flights took place in September, and test pilots have since completed around 15 hr. of coupled flights, with the most recent taking place Nov. 22.

“We believe we had a mature product after seven hours of flight,” Gierczynski says. The system has now been taken to a technology readiness level of around four, he says—ready for further exploitation where the OEM sees fit.

Vertex was the first Airbus Helicopters program supported by the UpNext organization, which aims to accelerate technology development by funding demonstrators.

“This successful demonstration of a fully autonomous flight from takeoff to landing is a great step toward the reduced pilot workload and simplified human-machine interface that the Airbus Urban Air Mobility team intends to implement on CityAirbus NextGen,” says Michael Augello, CEO of Airbus UpNext.

Airbus Helicopters says it will now continue to mature different technologies to support and further enhance Vertex, including vision-based sensors and algorithms for situational awareness and obstacle detection; a fly-by-wire for enhanced autopilot; and a head-worn display for in-flight monitoring and control.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9111138582229614}",neutral,0.9111138582229614,0
Safety Innovation #9: A system to prevent depressurisation accidents - Airbus,"Wed, 15 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTExLXNhZmV0eS1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLTktYS1zeXN0ZW0tdG8tcHJldmVudC1kZXByZXNzdXJpc2F0aW9uLWFjY2lkZW50c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus developed an automatic system which, in the event of cabin pressurisation system failure, takes over from the crew and brings the aircraft back to an altitude where it is possible to breathe normally.

On 14 August 2005, a passenger aircraft suffered a failure in its pressurisation system a few minutes after taking off from Larnaca Airport in Cyprus. This went undetected by the crew. As the aircraft continued to climb to an altitude of 33,000 ft (10,200 m), oxygen became increasingly scarce. The ensuing hypoxia (a reduction in the amount of oxygen delivered by the blood to the tissues) caused the occupants to lose consciousness. The plane, on its way to Prague and carrying 121 people, flew under autopilot until it ran out of fuel and eventually crashed near Marathon, north of Athens in Greece. Unfortunately, similar cases occurred on other passenger aircraft and business jets.

Aircraft typically cruise at altitudes of ~30,000-45,000 ft (~9,000-13,000 m) above sea level where the level of oxygen is not sufficient for humans to breathe. This is why aircraft are pressurised: to provide sufficient oxygen for the people on board. Usually, the air pressure is kept equivalent to an altitude of ~6,000-8,000 ft (~1,800-2,400 m) above sea level.

In the case of a loss of pressurisation in cruise, passengers and crew members must immediately use oxygen masks to prevent hypoxia. Depending on the altitude, the so-called time of useful consciousness is 15 seconds or less. The flight crew must then initiate an emergency descent procedure comprising immediate pilot actions as well as communication to air traffic control and passengers in the cabin. This will enable the aircraft to descend to a lower altitude where the oxygen level is sufficient to breathe without an oxygen mask.

Airbus developed the Automatic Emergency Descent (AED) function to enable the flight crew to initiate the emergency descent by pressing a button and extending the speed brakes. The aircraft will then automatically perform the manoeuvre while avoiding potential high terrain like mountain ranges. This dramatically reduces the workload for the crew in this critical situation.

As an additional safety net, in the event of cabin depressurisation where no crew reaction is detected, the AED will automatically activate after a countdown and initiate the emergency descent.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9982202649116516}",neutral,0.9982202649116516,0
Safety innovation #10: The jettisonable frame - Airbus,"Thu, 30 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTExLXNhZmV0eS1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLTEwLXRoZS1qZXR0aXNvbmFibGUtZnJhbWXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After several ditchings and capsizings, notably in the North Sea, Airbus Helicopters decided to make cabin evacuation even more effective to further improve survivability in the event of an accident on maritime missions.

The H160 introduces a new standard for emergency exits: an improved means of dumping its windows. The jettisonable frame allows faster evacuation than standard windows: Tests prior to the certification of this system showed that in the event of the aircraft ditching or capsizing, any occupant could safely eject the window in six seconds, four seconds less than with conventional windows.

The system has also been designed to be simple and highly intuitive to use. “Occupants don't have to think twice about triggering the evacuation. This aspect can be essential in an emergency situation where the brain's usual mode of operation may be disrupted” explains Louis Duroch, human factors expert at mission equipment department.

This device was the subject of a major test campaign in 2017. To reproduce conditions as close as possible to the real thing, a simulator was customised to resemble an H160 cabin, and was used to carry out underwater evacuations of a capsized cabin, with the cabin occupants strapped to their seats in the water, upside down.

Improving survivability is one of the main thrusts of Airbus Helicopters' aviation safety policy, which aims to avoid any deaths or serious injuries in survivable accidents by 2028.

The 12,000 Airbus helicopters in service worldwide may have to fly over a maritime area during their missions. It is estimated that between five and seven percent of this fleet is strictly assigned to maritime overflight missions.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6587105989456177}",positive,0.6587105989456177,1

Driving this momentum are rebounding air traffic as well as a demand for more digitally-enabled and connected aircraft.

The GSF sees more than 17,000 aircraft being replaced between now and 2042, as a result of continuous fleet modernisation and investment in latest generation aircraft. This will create growing market opportunities to reuse, repair and recycle.

“Airbus is well positioned to answer today’s and future services needs in order to support the industry doing more with less, increasing efficiency while reducing fuel consumption, emissions and noise,” says Cristina Aguilar Grieder, Senior Vice President Customer Services at Airbus.

Airbus expects the market for ‘Maintenance’ to grow from US$ 108 billion to US$ 210 billion. The market to ‘Enhance’ aircraft is expected to grow from US$ 11 billion annually to US$ 28 billion US$ and the market for ‘Train and Operate’ from US$ 11 billion to US$ 17 billion in 2042.

As a result, Airbus foresees a need for an additional 2.2 million highly skilled people over the next 20 years, consisting of 680,000 new technicians, 590,000 new pilots and 920,000 new cabin crew.

Global aviation services will see its biggest growth in South Asia, China and the Middle East. The regions with the highest market volume remain North America, Europe, China and Asia-Pacific.

Success! Hoist mission for floating wind turbines meets all goals - Airbus,"Tue, 21 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTExLXN1Y2Nlc3MtaG9pc3QtbWlzc2lvbi1mb3ItZmxvYXRpbmctd2luZC10dXJiaW5lcy1tZWV0cy1hbGwtZ29hbHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a world-premier trial, Airbus Helicopters and partners teamed up to show that helicopters are an important asset to support floating wind farms.

Foam streaked breaking waves and hoist lines whistled in the wind. Yet the helicopters were stable as the team attempted to land technicians atop a floating wind turbine in the Hywind Tampen wind farm off the coast of Bergen, Norway.

On 12 October, an H135 and an H145, from KN Helicopters and HTM Helicopters respectively, hoisted cargo and two crew members onto the nacelles of - yes, floating wind turbines - and what's more, in the rough autumn conditions (30 knots of wind and sea state 6) they'd set out to test. The day before, they lifted cargo onto the nacelle in almost 50 knots of wind and sea state 6.

It had taken a year to get here. In late 2022, Equinor agreed to hold the trials in Hywind Tampen, a floating wind farm already producing electricity to nearby platforms. Excitement built as the Airbus-led team foresaw data from real-world conditions: weather, air traffic, harsh sea states and the operational turbines’ behaviour.

Stringent precautions

The logistics involved a special permit (Air Operator Certificates) from the Norwegian aviation authority, safety audits, risk assessments and standard operation procedures (SOP), in addition to extensive briefings for all crew members. Having highly experienced flight crews was a must. HTM and KN Helicopters, of Germany and Denmark respectively, both leading providers of helicopter hoist services for the offshore wind industry loaned their pilots for the test flights.

“We’ve been hoisting to bottom-fixed offshore turbines for many years,” says Alain Vigneau, Head of Offshore Wind Market at Airbus Helicopters, regarding Airbus helicopter missions to offshore wind farms. “Now we want to demonstrate a helicopter’s capability in connection to floating turbines.”

And here on this blustery day, they would do just that. Even in the North Sea’s five and a half metre-high waves, conditions were challenging but feasible.

“The limit of what’s possible”

With wind farms moving further from land, the rush is on to install these 250-metre-high floating structures on supports moored to the seabed. Hywind Tampen is a unique set-up using 11 wind turbines 110 NM from shore to generate electricity to power its oil and gas platforms. But how to get a technician to the wind turbines, far from land, when waves and currents make it difficult for marine craft? “The conditions were at the upper limit of what is possible but we proved we could position the technicians on the turbine in a safe and efficient way,” says Bernd Brucherseifer, Managing Director and Pilot at HTM.

With 12 GoPro cameras on the helicopters, an H135 from KN Helicopters hoisted a cargo load onto a nacelle atop turbine N o 2. Next, an H145 from HTM hoisted two passengers onto the nacelle of turbine N o 2. ""Today we showed we could hoist from floating turbines even in high sea states,” says Martin Knudson, Chief Pilot at KN Helicopters.

‘Safely’ is certainly the operative word when assessing how to send technicians to turbines. A helicopter can transfer personnel in higher seas than marine vessels and in less time. “The helicopter is the only reasonable means to deploy personnel in this sea state,” says Christopher Brons-Illing, Senior Engineer Operations at Equinor, one of the trial’s organisers and part of the hoist team. “I’d definitely do it again.” It all adds up to less downtime for the turbines and more active use of technicians’ time – and quite possibly – a sprightlier technician at the end of the trip.

Footage from the cameras, plus motion data from the turbines, are now being analysed and will be shared with the industry to mature standard operating procedures for hoisting to floating turbines. A collective effort that augurs well for this emerging technology for renewable energy production.

Airbus U.S. Space and Defense Adds New Line of Business in Drones - FLYING,"Tue, 14 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZseWluZ21hZy5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXUtcy1zcGFjZS1hbmQtZGVmZW5zZS1hZGRzLW5ldy1saW5lLW9mLWJ1c2luZXNzLWluLWRyb25lcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has plenty of experience developing groundbreaking uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs)—the long-range, high-flying, record-setting Zephyr is perhaps the best example.

Now, Airbus U.S. Space and Defense is building on the success of Zephyr by launching a new, purpose-built business line dedicated to military UAVs, the company announced Thursday. The business doesn’t yet have a name. But its goal will be to effectively optimize, scale, and deploy uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS) for the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD).

Led by retired U.S. Army aviator Brian Zarchin, vice president of UAS for Airbus U.S. Space and Defense, the new unit will bring together experienced industry drone operators, as well as a few who flew UAVs for the military. Leadership will also comprise former defense engineers, maintainers, and stratospheric aviation experts.

“Airbus U.S. Space and Defense is uniquely positioned and passionately driven to provide trusted and affordable stratospheric deep sensing and network extension capability to our Warfighters,” said Zarchin. “With ongoing great power competition, it’s critical that we do our part to help deter threats and, in crisis or conflict, present our adversaries with multiple dilemmas. Our new business line is laser-focused on helping the DOD solve its toughest UAS challenges, from surface to stratosphere.”

Zarchin and his team members will bring expertise in Army tactical UAS, payload integration engineering, and fixed-wing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) operations within the Army’s Military Intelligence Corps. “High altitude experts” formerly with Google and the U.S. Air Force will also be on the roster.

Increasingly, the DOD is working with drone manufacturers, such as Skydio, Red Cat, and Teledyne FLIR, to bolster its capabilities.

According to its website, the department flies more than 11,000 different UAVs—ranging from hulking behemoths to insect-sized drones—primarily to support training, surveillance, and the testing of tactics and equipment. The DOD sends the occasional UAV shipment to Ukraine to combat Russian forces, and it’s aiding the Israel Defense Forces’ hostage recovery efforts in Gaza with unarmed MQ-9 Reaper surveillance drones.

Recently, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks revealed the U.S. Replicator Initiative: Its goal is to “outmatch” the drone production of enemies (such as China and Russia) by producing UAVs that are “small, smart, cheap, and many.” Over the next two years, the U.S. will churn out several thousand systems. And Hicks noted that private sector UAS firms, which now include Airbus U.S. Space and Defense, will have a major role to play in the effort.

It’s unclear exactly what kind of UAVs Airbus’ latest vertical will develop. But the phrasing in last week’s announcement may provide some clues.

“Today’s threat landscape is dominated not only by manned aircraft and expensive defense systems but also by swarms of unmanned systems of varying shapes, sizes, autonomy and operational capabilities,” the announcement read. “The DOD has consequently shifted to new and additional ways to outpace the threat, including scaling uncrewed systems and platforms that can track, detect, and counter today’s threats, while posturing for further advances in this technology.”

The new UAS business builds on the success of Zephyr, a solar-powered, fixed-wing UAS that flies in the stratosphere. Zephyr has spent more than 100 days in that layer of the atmosphere, shattering several uncrewed altitude and endurance records in the process.

Many of those came during a 2022 flight spanning more than 30,000 nm—long enough to lap the Earth and then some. That trip lasted 64 days and allowed Zephyr to rack up 1,500 consecutive hours flying above 60,000 feet, doubling its own record for the longest UAV flight.

In fact, the aircraft came just a few hours shy of setting the record for the longest flight of any kind. Incredibly, that honor is held by a pair of pilots who flew a Cessna 172 Skyhawk for 64 days and 22 hours straight—all the way back in 1959.

“The future battlespace is here, and our team is ensuring the warfighter is equipped with technology that allows them to make informed decisions to counter the threat,” said Rob Geckle, chairman and CEO of Airbus U.S. Space and Defense. “And while the Zephyr stratospheric platform is our foundational UAS program, we envision multiple UAS solutions supporting a range of customer missions and operational needs.”

Beyond Zephyr, Airbus U.S. Space and Defense also produces the Eurodrone for European ISR missions, the Aliaca for deployment from Naval ships, and the uncrewed, multimission VSR700 helicopter. It also offers UAS services such as the DeckFinder local positioning system and manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T), a software that connects UAVs and allows them to serve as force multipliers for crewed aircraft.

Airbus exploring development of future tanker based on A330neo - Breaking Defense,"Tue, 21 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vYnJlYWtpbmdkZWZlbnNlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzExL2FpcmJ1cy1leHBsb3JpbmctZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtb2YtZnV0dXJlLXRhbmtlci1iYXNlZC1vbi1hMzMwbmVvL9IBaWh0dHBzOi8vYnJlYWtpbmdkZWZlbnNlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzExL2FpcmJ1cy1leHBsb3JpbmctZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtb2YtZnV0dXJlLXRhbmtlci1iYXNlZC1vbi1hMzMwbmVvLz9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BELFAST — Airbus has taken the first steps in the potential development of a new Multi Role Tanker Transport Aircraft (MRTT) based on the A330neo commercial airliner, with hopes the future aircraft could be market ready by the end of the decade.

“We are thinking about the [A330]neo, it’s a very natural evolution of our [tanker] solution,” Maria Angeles Marti, Head of Tanker and Derivatives at Airbus Defence and Space, told reporters today. “We are going to go from the A330-200 to the evolved A330neo.”

The first steps include derisking studies for the potential new MRTT, as reported earlier by Flight Global and Aviation Week.

According to Angeles Marti’s remarks, provided by the company to Breaking Defense, she said that the new A330neo Trent 700 engines will provide greater fuel efficiency for operators and include different wings to the A330-200. She described the wings as a “little bit more flexible” than the older A330.

The new neo wing design delivers lower induced drag and higher lift “at all speeds and flight phases,” which in turn generates aerodynamic efficiency, lower fuel burn and increased range, according to Airbus company literature. The wingspan of the aircraft is an extraordinary 64 meters, just as wide as the fuselage is long.

Airbus has started derisking activities to consider the practicalities of converting the A330neo into a tanker, in which the manufacturer has a “high level of confidence,” according to Angeles Marti.

“The risk that we will take putting the pods, the technology on the A330neo is very low. We will probably have to imagine this scenario for the end of this decade,” she said.

Under wing pods are an essential part of the current A330 tanker as they enable hose and drogue refueling at an expedited fuel offload rate, meaning receivers are not overly burdened with long refueling intervals. Airbus says the pods are capable of refueling NATO aircraft or probe equipped receivers like the Eurofighter Typhoon, Tornado or F/A-18 Hornet. An Airbus-made Aerial Refueling Boom System is used when refueling receptacle equipped fighter jets like the American-made F-35 and F-16.

As of August 2023, a total of 76 A330MRTT aircraft had been ordered by Australia, France, NATO, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, the UK, Spain and Canada, according to Airbus figures.

The decision to explore development of a A330neo tanker comes less than a month after Lockheed Martin abruptly ended a partnership with Airbus on their A330MRTT-based LMXT proposal, a joint effort originally aimed at securing the US Air Force’s(USAF) KC-Y tanker program.

Lockheed quit the project by declaring that it would not be responding to a USAF KC-135 fleet recapitalization Request for Information (RFI), in a bid to instead concentrate on other programs like the Next-Generation Air-Refueling System (NGAS) effort. Airbus has since vowed to go it alone and previously told Breaking Defense it still intends on responding to the RFI.

The USAF had initially pushed KC-Y as a “bridge tanker” acquisition for around 175 aircraft and as an interim solution before pursuing the next generation tanker KC-Z effort, now NGAS.

Andrew Hunter, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics said in March that the service is edging toward buying an additional 75 Boeing KC-46A Pegasus tankers, making for uncertainty around a competition being staged that might include LMXT.

As for how Airbus’s next-generation A330neo-based tanker will fit into things, there are years to sort that out.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999823570251465}",neutral,0.9999823570251465,0

Collaborating for success: How Airbus partners to grow the UK space sector - Airbus,"Thu, 16 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTExLWNvbGxhYm9yYXRpbmctZm9yLXN1Y2Nlc3MtaG93LWFpcmJ1cy1wYXJ0bmVycy10by1ncm93LXRoZS11ay1zcGFjZS1zZWN0b3LSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"There is hardly a more gripping moment than launching a spacecraft – everything has to go perfectly and there is no room for error. However, getting there can be just as demanding. The success of any Airbus space mission hinges on close collaboration with UK partners, from working with world leading academia on research and development, to drawing on the expertise of specialist suppliers.

Whether it is bringing people closer together through communications, providing new perspectives on our planet or enabling us to explore new frontiers in the solar system – space technology is a powerful force for innovation, collaboration, and discovery.

As the largest space company in the UK, Airbus Defence and Space develops and manufactures space technology mainly at its key sites in Stevenage and Portsmouth. The company works closely with academic institutions and companies on research and development. Not to mention various UK suppliers.

Partnering on cutting-edge research

Academic institutions play an important role in driving and validating innovations – especially in the space sector. This also makes them essential partners for us at Airbus: in the UK, Airbus is funding various PhDs and research projects across the countries.

At Wrexham University in North Wales, for example, cutting-edge research and development of precision optics and optical systems led to the creation of a commercial arm, Glyndwr Innovations. One of its areas of expertise is hyperspectral imaging.

A hyperspectral imager is a device that takes 300 images of a scene simultaneously across many narrow spectral bands (colours). It provides comprehensive image data, allowing you to spot even the tiniest colour variations and distinguish the composition of the scene in much greater detail. It has a wide range of applications, including the detection of skin cancer in humans, blight in crops, and even the presence of mineral deposits in landscapes.

As a university, we can be a facilitator. Projects like this are what make the direction of our research both tangible and commercially viable.

Professor Caroline Gray OBE, Director of the OpTIC Technology Centre Wrexham University

Paired with satellite imagery, hyperspectral imaging can also play a major role in environmental monitoring, as Professor Caroline Gray OBE, Director of the OpTIC Technology Centre at Wrexham University is well aware. “Tracing pollutants in air, water and soil, or detecting disease and insect infestations in forests are just a few examples of how we can benefit from hyperspectral imaging from space,"" she says.

To further explore this potential, Glyndwr Innovations joined forces with Airbus. So far, the partnership has produced a lab based technology demonstrator that proves the system works as expected. ""The next step will be to produce a flight-ready system,"" Gray says.

For Professor Gray, this collaboration is a prime example of how the relationship between academia and industry should work: ""As a university, we can be a facilitator. Projects like this are what make the direction of our research both tangible and commercially viable. This in turn helps us build our reputation and fund our work, while at the same time contributing to the growth of the skills and knowledge needed by the UK industry.”

Developing new products and technologies

Developing new products for the space industry can come with a steep learning curve, making collaboration a must. That is why Airbus is working with businesses across the UK to co-develop new space technologies.

A company that has recently increased its involvement with the space sector is Reliance Precision. Based in Huddersfield, UK, the company has over 100 years' experience in manufacturing high quality gears and precision actuation components.

As a specialist manufacturer, the company works with customers in a variety of industries, but space was more or less new territory for them. ""Back in the 90s, we made a large Solar Array Drive Mechanism gear that was later used in the Rosetta probe to chase down Comet 67P,” says Andrew Butt, Head of Business Development & Commercial.

In the space sector there is a real sense of cooperation and consistent support that I haven't experienced in any other industry.

Andrew Butt, Head of Business Development & Commercial Reliance Precision

In 2017, a new challenge arose for Reliance Precision when Airbus approached the team to develop a new stepper motor gearbox (SMG) for Airbus Stevenage’s solar array drive mechanisms. In brief, this motor is responsible for pointing the solar arrays of large geostationary satellites towards the sun. This resulted in the development of the NeoSMG for the Eurostar Neo based satellites, which was first launched into space in October 2022 as part of the Eutelsat HOTBIRD 13F.

""Our thought right from the start was: 'This project is literally written in the stars for us,'"" Andrew Butt says. But at the same time, the project meant a big change in the way Reliance Precision worked. “We had to deeply engage with the unique requirements of the space sector and adapt our product assurance and quality standards to its needs.”

Together with Airbus, Reliance Precision developed the NeoSMG, a stepper motor gearbox for Airbus Stevenage’s solar array drive mechanisms. (Image source: Reliance Precision)

In the end, Reliance Precision went through a huge learning curve – an experience Andrew Butt would not want to miss: ""Compared to other industries, I was surprised at how collaborative the relationships are. There is a real sense of cooperation and consistent support that I haven't experienced in any other industry.”

Looking towards the future, Reliance's space journey has only just begun: the company has secured a second space contract with Airbus to produce a further 26 NeoSMGs.

Leveraging the UK supply chain

Building spacecraft is a big team effort. For all its space missions, Airbus Defence and Space relies on expertise and high-tech components from all over the UK – provided by more than 2,000 approved suppliers, more than 50 per cent of which are SMEs.

To make the most efficient use of fuel and to keep launch costs down, the parts of a spacecraft have to be as light as possible, while still being able to withstand the enormous forces they are subjected to.

Headquartered in Wrexham, North Wales, Tritech Group – an expert in investment casting – has a solution for this. Dubbed “Enhanced Properties Investment Casting” (EPIC), the company has developed a process that combines advanced engineering and casting techniques to produce lightweight, high-strength components for satellites and other applications.

""The parts we produce have superior mechanical properties at the weight of aluminum, making them ideal for orbital applications,"" explains Kimberly Northover, Business Development & Marketing Manager at Tritech. The company has contributed components to various space missions already. “We work in partnership with our customers, offering design and manufacturing advice and collaborating to find joint solutions.”

Working across the civil, defence and space sectors, we are in a perfect position to identify best practices and promote knowledge sharing.

Kimberly Northover, Business Development & Marketing Manager Tritech Group

Tritech has long been a loyal supporter of Airbus. It all started 40 years ago in the Commercial Aircraft business. Since then, the relationship has expanded to also cover the defence and space sectors. ""This diversification allows us to showcase that we are a trusted partner across a wide variety of sectors,” Northover says. ""There is also a lot of synergy. Working across the civil, defence and space sectors, we are in a perfect position to identify best practices and promote knowledge sharing – which ultimately benefits Airbus.""

Going forward, Tritech is looking to further develop its manufacturing techniques and drive innovation. “Airbus is shaping the future of aerospace and we are excited to be part of it.”

More on Airbus in the UK

With more than 25 sites stretching from Aberdeen to Portsmouth, Airbus makes an extensive contribution to the UK – not just in the space sector, but also with regard to civil aerospace, military aircraft and helicopters. All of this, while relying on diverse skills, advanced technologies and facilities that only the UK can provide.

Virtual cockpit: Lufthansa Group and Airbus present digital training technology at the Digital Summit hosted by the ... - newsroom.lufthansagroup.com,"Mon, 20 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitQFodHRwczovL25ld3Nyb29tLmx1ZnRoYW5zYWdyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi92aXJ0dWFsLWNvY2twaXQtbHVmdGhhbnNhLWdyb3VwLWFuZC1haXJidXMtcHJlc2VudC1kaWdpdGFsLXRyYWluaW5nLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktYXQtdGhlLWRpZ2l0YWwtc3VtbWl0LWhvc3RlZC1ieS10aGUtZmVkZXJhbC1nb3Zlcm5tZW50LWluLWplbmEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Virtual-reality headset instead of simulator: At the Federal Government’s Digital Summit in Jena on November 20th and 21st, Lufthansa Group and Airbus will present a new digital training option for pilots. With the help of VR glasses and a laptop, the so-called “Virtual Procedure Trainer"" offers an authentic view of an aircraft cockpit in 3D. By this means, standard operating procedures, which are practiced in a simulator so far, can be trained effectively and more sustainably. The lifelike realization, furthermore, helps to prepare for later phases in the training program. The training content can be repeated as often as the individual needs of the pilots require.

Several politicians will seize the opportunity to find out more about VR cockpit training at the joint exhibition stand of Lufthansa Group and Airbus. It is expected that, among others, Dr. Volker Wissing, Federal Minister for Digital and Transport, Stefan Schnorr, State Secretary at the Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport, Dr. Franziska Brantner, Parliamentary State Secretary at the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, and Daniela Kluckert, Parliamentary State Secretary to the Federal Minister for Digital and Transport, will visit the stand.

Matthias Spohr, CEO Lufthansa Aviation Training:” The Federal Government’s Digital Summit is the perfect opportunity to present these new training options for pilots. As a launching partner of the virtual cockpit and together with Airbus, we bring digital progress to life. In this way, Lufthansa Aviation Training is setting new standards for training concepts in terms of quality and innovation.”

Fabrice Hamel, VP of Airbus Flight Operations & Training: “We look back with satisfaction on our cooperation with Lufthansa Aviation Training and are very happy with the positive feedback we are getting. The Virtual Procedure Trainer conveys complex training content in a vivid way and can be put to use without any restrictions in terms of time and place. In this way, it provides optimal support to pilots in preparing and expanding on their training content, thus making it an indispensable tool for increasing competence and safety in air traffic.”

With the VR glasses it is currently possible to simulate the cockpit of the A320 family, one of the most popular passenger planes for the short and medium ranges. In future, the software will be able to render further types of aircraft, such as the A330 and A350 long-haul aircraft. Depending on the further development of the hardware, it is expected that the system can be used flexibly at different locations. The software can be used with VR equipment and by way of supplementation also via an iPad app.

The first two VR set-ups have been successfully installed in Frankfurt and Vienna. As part of a test phase examining user acceptance and software and hardware potential, the extent is being investigated to which the VR solution can be integrated into the Lufthansa Group training environment in the best way possible. LAT, the Lufthansa Group airlines, and Airbus collaborate closely in the further development of the software. The goal is an integration in the type rating course for all pilots of the supported aircraft types.

Airbus HBCplus client list grows including for Emirates A380 retrofit - Runway Girl Network,"Thu, 16 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjMvMTEvYWlyYnVzLWhiY3BsdXMtZW1pcmF0ZXMtYTM4MHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus’ groundbreaking new supplier-furnished catalogue option for inflight connectivity — known as Airspace Link HBCplus — has been making waves since the programme was first announced in 2022. Now Airbus reports from the Dubai Airshow that shipset commitments for HBCplus installations have grown to 125 aircraft across three aircraft families: the A330neo, A350 and A380. Notably, the A380 installs will be delivered as a retrofit package to Emirates, as the carrier plans to keep its double-decker aircraft flying well into the future.

All 125 aircraft commitments for HBCplus made to date will use Viasat London (formerly Inmarsat) as their managed service provider, with the firm’s Global Xpress (GX) Ka-band satellite service in line to support high-speed Internet on board each aircraft type.

That means that Safran Passenger Innovations, which is sitting pretty as terminal provider and integrator to Airbus on both the Ka-band and Ku-band sides of the linefit HBCplus programme (and indeed for retrofits), will provide its ThinKom Solutions Ka2517 VICTS-based terminal for the 125 commitments secured by Airbus. Other prominent suppliers standing to benefit from Airbus’ HBCplus Ka-band IFC wins include Astronics, which is delivering the outside aircraft equipment including radome and adapter plate, and aero modem manufacturer ST Engineering iDirect.

Launch customer Emirates is by far the largest client of HBCplus, having selected the solution to be linefitted to 50 new Airbus A350s, as first announced at this year’s Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg. Together with its new order for Airbus’ retrofit package on 60 A380s, the carrier has committed 110 aircraft to HBCplus.

It’s not immediately clear when the HBCplus Ka-band IFC retrofits on Emirates’ A380s will begin. Referencing Airbus’ delivery of the engineering mod solution and kits to Emirates’ designated upgrades/MRO facility, an Airbus spokesperson says: “that generally depends on the timing required by the customer.” RGN has sought comment from Emirates.

The Dubai-based airline has in the past turned to Lufthansa Technik when retrofitting some of its A380s with Panasonic Avionics’ IFC system. But Emirates also boasts its own extensive MRO facilities so its engineering team may opt to handle the IFC retrofits in-house. (The carrier has certainly shown itself adept at nose to tail refurbishments. Last year, it earmarked 67 of its near 90 in-service A380s for a broader refurbishment programme, including a refresh in every cabin and the installation of new Premium Economy class cabins. So far, 16 aircraft have been upgraded and are now in full commercial service.)

Once the A380 IFC retrofits are completed, Emirates passengers aboard these 60 super jumbos should be able to expect a vastly improved experience when trying to browse the Internet. At present, many of Emirates’ A380s carry a low-bandwidth L-band satellite-based offering which is also supported by Viasat London after Viasat’s acquisition of Inmarsat. That L-band satellite service has not received a great reception from passengers, but is also apparently now seeing some service interruptions as a service migration plan is pursued by the satellite operator. “Due to a satellite issue outside of our control, our customer Wi-Fi and mobile service may not be available on some of our A380 flights. We’re sorry for this inconvenience and hope to be back online again soon,” Emirates confides in a message to passengers.

Other customers for HBCplus are Ethiopian Airlines, which selected the solution to be linefitted to four new A350s during the 2023 Aircraft Interiors Expo. In the ‘new customer’ category, Airbus announced at the Dubai Airshow that Air Algerie is also taking the Ka-band variant of HBCplus, covering five A330neo linefits whilst Air India will have six A350 linefitted with the solution.

HBCplus enables participating airlines to switch bandwidth suppliers without changing the linefit (or approved retrofit package for) inflight connectivity hardware on their aircraft. With Airbus providing the broadband connectivity kit — and related services — as linefit supplier furnished equipment, the airframer effectively considers the certified terminal and radome to be part of the aircraft.

That means that, in the future, if any of the HBCplus airline customers revealed to date want to try a different service provider, they can avail of a multi-orbit option from SES — which, in addition to Viasat London, is an MSP on the Ka-band side of the programme — without changing the Ka-band terminal hardware. For now, these airlines have chosen an MSP with a ‘here and now’ service in the form of Viasat London GX, operating over a nextgen antenna system.

“We are honoured that Airbus’ HBCplus launch customer Emirates has reaffirmed its confidence by selecting the technology for its flagship A380 fleet. Together with our partners Viasat and Safran Passenger Innovations, we are also thrilled that more airlines, now also including Air Algerie and Air India, have chosen to equip HBCplus across their Airbus fleets to keep their travellers connected with lightning-fast internet,” says André Schneider, Airbus VP Cabin & Cargo Programme.

“Seeing our valued customers committing to our reliable satellite connectivity model, while combining a flexible choice of network providers and seamless hardware integration, is a real testimony to our Airspace Link philosophy.”

These HBCplus deals also speak to a shifting landscape where satellite operators have a much more direct pipeline to the airlines. Emirates, for instance, has long used SITA as its service provider across different aircraft types and across different IFC hardware, but SITA will exit the cabin connectivity business on 31 January 2025, as exclusively reported by RGN.

Airbus To Develop Second-Generation MRTT Based On A330neo - Aviation Week,"Tue, 21 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9kZWZlbnNlLXNwYWNlL211bHRpLW1pc3Npb24tYWlyY3JhZnQvYWlyYnVzLWRldmVsb3Atc2Vjb25kLWdlbmVyYXRpb24tbXJ0dC1iYXNlZC1hMzMwbmVv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HUELVA, Spain—Airbus has begun de-risking work to develop a second-generation Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) version based on its A330neo.

The efforts underway are geared to paving the way for the OEM to transition from the existing A330-200ceo model to the reengined, re-winged A330neo, potentially by the turn of the decade.

Much of the focus of the de-risking studies, says Maria Angeles Marti, Airbus Defense and Space’s head of tanker and derivatives, is around whether the Neo’s new wing can accommodate hose and drogue pods for refueling probe-equipped combat aircraft.

“The wings [of the Neo] are a little more flexible and the engines are different, but this is one of the activities we are running today, and we have a high level of confidence,” Marti says.

When the A330 was first developed in the 1980s and into the ’90s, it shared the same wing as the four-engine A340. Airbus was able to hang the hose-drogue unit from the pylon where an A340 outer engine would have been fitted. But that option does not exist on the re-winged A330neos.

“With the A330neo, the aircraft will be capable of doing the same task as it does today, but we will be able to bring in all the innovation the [Neo-model] aircraft brings to the commercial market as well because it is more fuel-efficient,” Marti told journalists here on Nov. 21. “It [the Neo] is a natural evolution of our solution.”

She was speaking as Airbus UpNext innovation personnel performed the latest trial in its Auto’Mate program to develop a fully automated refueling capability that could be used for uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS), such as those that may support combat aircraft.

A transition to Neo from Ceo is needed as Airbus plans to halt production of the A330-200ceo, which is now only built to support the MRTT program. The last passenger model A330-200 was delivered to Spanish operator Level in 2019.

Potential MRTT operators still have the option to convert aircraft purchased second hand from the commercial market. But Marti suggests the stock for conversions is dwindling if air forces want aircraft that can be operated for 30 years.

Marti would not confirm which A330neo variant would be developed into the MRTT, but Airbus has never developed an MRTT based on the longer-fuselage A330-300. That model correspondingly has been developed into the A330-900, which suggests the MRTT Neo will be based on the -800neo platform.

Airbus plans to begin marketing the MRTT Neo to potential customers in the near future, Marti says. Airbus already has several sales campaigns as well as for potential top-up orders from existing customers. Some 77 MRTTs have been ordered by customers, with 59 delivered.

Canada is the latest country to procure the MRTT, buying nine A330-200s, eight of which will be converted to the MRTT standard. The ninth will be used as a VIP aircraft.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999879598617554}",neutral,0.9999879598617554,0
Airbus Predicts Doubling Of Services Segment Through To 2042 - Aviation Week,"Wed, 29 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9tcm8vc2VydmljZXMtc3VwcG9ydC9haXJidXMtcHJlZGljdHMtZG91Ymxpbmctc2VydmljZXMtc2VnbWVudC10aHJvdWdoLTIwNDLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A rise in global air traffic along with an increased number of connected aircraft in the fleet will lead to the services market more than doubling over the next 20 years, Airbus predicts.

In its latest global services forecast released on Nov. 29, the Toulouse-headquartered aircraft manufacturer projects the overall services market will have a value of $255 billion from this year through to 2042. More than 44,000 connected commercial aircraft are expected to be in operation by then, with 95% of these being new-generation aircraft types.

Maintenance will account for the largest portion of services over the 20-year period, with a value of $210 billion. For 2023, Airbus estimates the market to be worth $130 billion, which represents a 46% year-on-year growth thanks to continuation of the post-pandemic recovery.

Aircraft enhancement services, which include modifications work, will account for $28 billion, while training—worth $11 billion in 2023—will generate $17 billion by 2042.

China is anticipated to grow at the fastest rate and by 2042 will be the world’s largest services region with a value of $54 billion, followed by Europe ($48 billion), North America ($45 billion), and Asia-Pacific ($43 billion).

After China, the largest growth percentages over the 20-year period are expected by the South Asia and Middle East regions.

Airbus also predicts approximately 17,170 aircraft are expected to be replaced in the global fleet from 2023-42, a scenario it says gives an opportunity to reuse, repair, and recycle aircraft.

As part of these fleet changes, the OEM calculates a $17 billion passenger-to-freighter segment value, with the market for used serviceable materials for exchange measured at $45 billion over 20 years.

Airbus, the European aerospace giant, saw its helicopter deliveries plummet 33% year-on-year (YoY) in the third quarter, from 78 units to 52 units. This decline resulted in a 17%YoY drop in revenue for the company’s helicopter segment, from €1.7bn to €1.5bn.

Subsequently, helicopter segment earnings-before-income tax (EBIT) fell 13% YoY to €143m from €165m.

The company attributed lower deliveries to a number of factors including supply chain disruptions, the ongoing war in Ukraine, and the economic slowdown in China.

Airbus’ helicopter net order intake also took a hit, falling 22% YoY from 246 units to 191 units. This contraction shrunk the order book by 5% YoY to 751 units.

The decline in new orders was partly due to the cancellation of several orders from Russian customers, as well as the ongoing uncertainty in the global helicopter market.

Despite the setbacks in the helicopter segment, Airbus managed to eke out a positive quarter overall. The company’s commercial aircraft deliveries were up, and its satellite business performed well.

On a cumulative basis, during the nine months, Airbus delivered 197 helicopters, four more that it did in 2022. The helicopter segment’s revenue during the nine months stood at €4.6bn, slightly higher than €4.5bn in the preceding year.

“We continue to make progress on our operational plan in a global environment that has become increasingly complex,” said Guillaume Faury, CEO, Airbus. “The nine-month earnings reflect higher commercial aircraft deliveries, the good performance in helicopters as well as charges linked to the reassessment of certain satellite development programmes.”

Overall, Airbus’ third-quarter results were a mixed bag. The company’s helicopter segment struggled, but its commercial aircraft and satellite businesses performed well. Airbus remains confident in its ability to weather the current challenges and emerge stronger.

Defense Business Unit Reorganization Planned | Airbus - American Machinist,"Mon, 13 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtZXJpY2FubWFjaGluaXN0LmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUvMjEyNzcyODYvZGVmZW5zZS1idXNpbmVzcy11bml0LXJlb3JnYW5pemF0aW9uLXBsYW5uZWQtYWlyYnVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus will be reorganizing its Airbus Defence and Space subsidiary “in order to cope with an evolving defence and security environment,” the group stated in its recent Q3 2023 statement. The revamp seeks to adopt new “ways of working,” and to “reinforce end-to-end accountability and ownership in the business lines and improve competitiveness.” Reportedly, the reorganization will involve Airbus cutting about 750 employees from approximately 34,000 now attached to the Defence and Space subsidiary.

The organizational changes were outlined in the manufacturer’s recent Q3 report, though Airbus has not confirmed the number of reductions, nor the schedule for carrying out the reorganization. Published reports add that the layoffs will not necessarily take place, as Airbus will accomplish the reduction through employee attrition and delays in hiring replacements.

""The transformation might entail some organizational refinements; however the bigger focus is on governance, process, and ways of working,"" an Airbus representative told Reuters.

The unit posted a €300-million third-quarter loss ($321 million) that it assigned to charges related to its various communication satellite and defense technology programs.

It’s also been reported that Airbus Defence will be consolidating the administration of its separate stakes in two fighter jet programs, the current Eurofighter consortium with BAE Systems and Leonardo, and the Future Combat Air System under development by Airbus with Dassault Aviation and Indra Sistemas.
