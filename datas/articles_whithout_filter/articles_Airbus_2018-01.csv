Airbus to open first US West Coast training center - Airbus,"Thu, 04 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wMS1haXJidXMtdG8tb3Blbi1maXJzdC11cy13ZXN0LWNvYXN0LXRyYWluaW5nLWNlbnRlctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus acquires flight training center in Aurora, Colorado

Move expands Airbus flight training availability for North American operators

Airbus has more than tripled its number of training locations worldwide in only three years

In a move to further expand its global training capacity, Airbus has acquired the Strategic Simulation Solutions flight training center in Aurora, Colorado, a Denver suburb. Currently, the training center primarily supports Frontier Airlines and has significant room for growth. Airbus plans to at least double capacity at the facility in the next few years.

“This is another major step forward in our ambition to grow services around the world,” said Laurent Martinez, Head of Services by Airbus. “Our Global Services Forecast predicts a need for 122,000 new pilots in the Americas by 2035, representing 23% of the world’s demand. We want our Airbus flight training facilities to be easily accessible to our customers regardless of their location, hence this latest move.”

Prior to this acquisition, Airbus provided training to the North American region primarily from its Miami, Florida-based training center. The addition of the new Aurora training center will help meet long-term growth in expanding markets throughout the Americas. Over the past two years Airbus has expanded its training capacity for customers in the Americas with the addition of training centers in Mexico City, Mexico and in Campinas, Brazil.

At a worldwide level, Airbus expanded its training network more than threefold in only three years; growing from five locations in 2015 to 17 locations today.

“We will hold steady in our ambition to provide the most state-of-the-art, top-quality training to our customers, and to continue expanding our global training capacity at its current pace,” Martinez said.

Currently, the Aurora training center has two A320 Family, FAA Level D full flight simulators – the highest-level flight simulators – for training of Frontier Airlines pilots on the airline’s all-Airbus fleet. Additional simulators will be added at the Aurora facility in 2018 to address anticipated increased demand for training. Additionally, Airbus’ innovative ACT Suite – a fully comprehensive, high-fidelity course for maintenance training can also be set up within a week’s notice and will be offered in line with demand.

Airbus’ modular, competency-based training services deliver a comprehensive mix of theoretical courses, hands-on practice and environment immersion using the latest technologies – including virtual, augmented and mixed reality."

Airbus WorldDEM4Ortho in ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World - Esri,"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3JpLmNvbS9hcmNnaXMtYmxvZy9wcm9kdWN0cy9hcmNnaXMtbGl2aW5nLWF0bGFzL2ltYWdlcnkvYWlyYnVzLXdvcmxkZGVtNG9ydGhvLWluLWFyY2dpcy1saXZpbmctYXRsYXMtb2YtdGhlLXdvcmxkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World provides foundation elevation layers to support your work in 2D and 3D. Over the last couple of years, Esri has been developing World Elevation Services primarily from best authoritative data from open sources and contributions to the Esri Community Maps for Elevation program.

We are glad to announce that we are adding global elevation data from Airbus Defence and Space to further enhance Esri Elevation Layers (Terrain and TopoBathy) and Tools (Profile, Viewshed and Summarize Elevation). WorldDEM4Ortho, which is based on the global WorldDEM dataset, has a resolution of 0.8 arc second (approx. 24 meters) with a vertical accuracy of ~ 4 m (LE90%)* on a global scale. Covering the entire earth’s land surface (excluding the countries of Azerbaijan, DR Congo and Ukraine), this is the most consistent and accurate satellite-based elevation model on a global scale. This dataset brings many improvements over areas with SRTM 30 m coverage and areas above latitudes of 60 degree north and south.

This dataset is now available in world elevation layers and tools to all ArcGIS Online subscribers. Let’s see few examples showing enhancements over SRTM 30 m.

Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania – a dormant stratovolcano and the highest mountain in Africa at an elevation of 5,895 m (19,341 ft) above sea level (SRTM 30 m vs WorldDEM4Ortho 24 m)

A portion near Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Tanzania depicted with newly released WorldDEM4Ortho 24 m (bottom) showing improvements over SRTM 30 m (top)

Cotopaxi, Ecuador– an active stratovolcano in Andes mountains and the second highest summit in Ecuador at an elevation of 5,897 m (19,347 ft) above sea level (SRTM 30 m vs WorldDEM4Ortho 24 m)

Ojos del Salado—the highest active volcano in the world at 6,893 m (22,615 ft) on the Argentina–Chile border (SRTM 30 m vs WorldDEM4Ortho 24 m)

Nevado Sajam, Bolivia —an extinct stratovolcano and the highest peak in Bolivia at 6,542 m (21,463 ft) above sea level (SRTM 30 m vs WorldDEM4Ortho 24 m)

Mount Fuji, Japan – an active stratovolcano and the highest mountain in Japan at an elevation of 3,776.24 m (12,389 ft) above sea level (SRTM 30 m vs WorldDEM4Ortho 24 m)

The world elevation image services (Terrain and TopoBathy) are a collection of multi-resolution and multi-source elevation data that can be used for visualization (such as multi-directional hillshade, tinted hillshade) and analysis. When using for visualization, the service will automatically display the data from best source at a given location, thus providing a seamless user experience. With this update, Airbus WorldDEM4Ortho will take priority over SRTM when rendering visualizations.

While doing analysis in ArcGIS desktop clients (Pro or ArcMap), you need to choose a dataset from the service depending upon your analysis requirements. These services being dynamic image services provides the ability to make a request in user defined coordinate system, cell size and extent which make these suitable to use for analysis. Each dataset in these services has a unique identifier and a query can be defined based on ProductName or Dataset_ID. For example, a definition query of “ProductName” = ‘Airbus_WorldDEM4Ortho_24m’ will filter data pertaining to the Airbus WorldDEM4Ortho grid only. To make a request in user defined parameters, use the Make Image Server Layer geoprocessing tool. This tool generates a temporary layer that can be used as an input in other geoprocessing tools to perform analysis.

Airbus WorldDEM4Ortho is also rolled out in Elevation Analysis Tools (Profile, Viewshed and Summarize Elevation) and can be invoked in these tools by selecting 24 m option from the drop-down menu of DEM Resolution parameter.

These updates will also be rolled out to other world elevation derivative products – Elevation 3D (Terrain3D and TopoBathy3D), World Hillshade and World Topo Base over the next month or so. Stay tuned!

For more information about the various data sources available in World Elevation services, check out Elevation coverage map. Esri will keep improving World Elevation Services, Tools and derivative products by including high resolution data from open source and Esri Community Maps program.

Emirates has agreed to a firm order for 20 Airbus A380 airliners along with an option for 16 additional superjumbos.

At list prices, Thursday's deal is worth as much as about $16 billion, though it is customary in the aviation industry for important customers such as Emirates to receive major discounts.

Earlier this week, Airbus indicated that it would consider shuttering the A380 program without an additional order from Emirates.

""This new order underscores Airbus' commitment to produce the A380 at least for another 10 years,"" Airbus' sales chief, John Leahy, said in a statement. ""I'm personally convinced more orders will follow Emirates’ example and that this great aircraft will be built well into the 2030s.""

Emirates is, by far, the Airbus A380's largest customer. The airline operates 101 of the aircraft. No other airline has more than 18.

""We’ve made no secret of the fact that the A380 has been a success for Emirates,"" the airline's chairman and CEO, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, said in a statement. ""Our customers love it, and we've been able to deploy it on different missions across our network, giving us flexibility in terms of range and passenger mix.""

Thursday's deal brings Emirates' total commitment to the A380 program up to 178 aircraft and a total value of $60 billion.

The newly ordered planes will be used both to expand the A380 fleet and to replace aircraft that were delivered in 2008.

Aircraft from this latest tranche of planes are expected to be delivered after 2020.

In recent years, Airbus a struggled to find new buyers for the world's largest airliner. Prior to Thursday, the A380 program had been without a major airline order for the aircraft since Emirates' previous order in 2013."

2017 was another record year for commercial aircraft deliveries. The order backlog is equivalent to almost 10 years of production.

Boeing delivered more aircraft than Airbus for the sixth straight year in 2017, and looks set to repeat this in 2018.

Boeing also beat Airbus on orders received in 2017, but Airbus has a bigger backlog, thanks to the A320neo family.

The commercial aerospace sector is in good health, but is going through structural change in 2018

2017 was another record year for commercial aircraft deliveries

According to the CAPA Fleet Database, the total number of commercial aircraft delivered in 2017 reached another record high.

The database recorded 1,740 deliveries in 2017, which was 1.5% more than the 1,714 aircraft delivered in 2016. This was the seventh consecutive year of rising delivery numbers.

The last fall in annual deliveries was in 2010, when they fell by 3.2%, to 1,269. From 2010 to 2017 annual deliveries grew overall by 37%, and at a compound average annual rate of 4.6% pa (although growth has not exceeded 2% in any of the past three years).

Global commercial aircraft annual deliveries, by region: 2008 to 2017

The order backlog is equivalent to almost 10 years of production

The CAPA Fleet Database records 31,600 commercial aircraft in service at the end of 2017, an increase of 4.1% versus 2016.

The number of outstanding firm orders at the end of 2017 was 17,018. The order backlog was nearly 54% of the number of aircraft in service at the end of 2017 (versus 51% at the end of 2016).

Expressed as the number of years of production, the order backlog increased from 9.0 years at the end of 2016 to 9.8 years at the end of 2017 - a record high for the jet era.

Boeing delivered more than Airbus for the sixth straight year in 2017…

The past year was the first time that both Boeing and Airbus delivered more than 700 aircraft in the same year, but the US manufacturer outsold its European rival for the sixth successive year.

Boeing's 763 deliveries in 2017 beat Airbus' 718 by 6%, although the gap is closing relative to 9% in 2016 and 20% in 2015 (according to data from the manufacturers).

Airbus last delivered more than Boeing in 2011, which had been its ninth year in a row of beating its rival.

For Boeing, its 2017 total was a return to growth, after its 2016 figure of 748 had dipped versus 762 in 2015. For both manufacturers, 2017 was a record year for deliveries.

Airbus and Boeing annual aircraft deliveries: 1996 to 2017

…and looks set to repeat this in 2018

Current data in the CAPA Fleet Database indicate that both Airbus and Boeing will enjoy double-digit growth in delivery numbers in 2018, but Boeing will again come out on top.

The database shows 857 deliveries for Boeing and 848 for Airbus this year, giving the US airframer a lead of only 1%.

Typically, the annual delivery numbers projected at the start of the year turn out to be higher than the actual tally of deliveries reported at the end of that year, due to minor production delays (particularly on newer aircraft programmes), rescheduling, and the occasional market exit by airlines.

Nevertheless, 2018 looks set to provide Boeing with a seventh successive winning year for deliveries.

Boeing also beat Airbus on orders received in 2017…

Boeing also comfortably beat Airbus on the number of orders received in 2017, with 912 versus 776. These figures are both significantly lower than at the peak in 2014, when they each achieved more than 1,500 orders.

Nevertheless, both Boeing and Airbus had a record order backlog at the end of 2017.

Airbus and Boeing: net orders received in 2017

…but Airbus is dominating narrowbody orders

According to the CAPA Fleet Database, Airbus had almost 7,500 outstanding firm orders, giving it a 13% lead over Boeing's order book total of just on the other side of 6,600.

Expressed as the number of years of production, Airbus' order backlog was 10.4 years and Boeing's was 8.7 years at the end of 2017.

Airbus' superior backlog is built on its narrowbody aircraft, for which it has more than 6,300 orders. This is 21% more than Boeing's 5,200 narrowbody orders, but as noted, Airbus trails Boeing by 17% in widebody orders (1,150 versus close to 1,400).

In the battle between new-generation narrowbodies, Airbus A320neo family has 5,900 orders, compared with 4,700 for Boeing 737MAX variants.

Boeing has more aircraft in service than Airbus

Due to its longer history, Boeing still has a larger number of aircraft in service, with more than 11,500 at the end of 2017 (not counting 608 McDonnell Douglas aircraft), compared with Airbus aircraft in service, of the order of more than 9,300 units.

Airbus trails Boeing more significantly in widebodies in service than it does in narrowbodies - Airbus has almost 2,100 widebodies in operation, 37% fewer than Boeing's 3,300, versus its 7,200 narrowbodies in service, a deficit of 12% compared with 8,200 for Boeing.

The commercial aerospace sector in good health, but going through structural change in 2018

After seven consecutive years of rising deliveries, the commercial aerospace sector is enjoying the good times, buoyed by strong airline profitability. Perhaps emboldened by this, the sector could effect significant change in 2018.

Airbus has already taken control of Bombardier's CSeries programme, and this is likely to take priority over the A319neo (while the A321neo goes from strength to strength). A tie-up between Boeing and Embraer could lead to further changes in the structure of this end of the market.

In the widebody segment, the A380, which is Airbus' most high profile aircraft programme, faces an uncertain future, Boeing has the upper hand. Airbus is likely to wait for Boeing to launch its new mid-market aircraft before deciding what to do next in the widebody area.

The bull run of delivery growth has endured, but growth in annual deliveries has been slow in each of the past three years. Although airline margins are at record high levels, there are signs that they may not rise further.

At the moment there is no reason to foresee a major downturn in the near term, but maintaining the existing good health of both airlines and manufacturers will be a positive outcome for 2018."
Biomimicry: engineering in nature's style - Airbus,"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE4LTAxLWJpb21pbWljcnktZW5naW5lZXJpbmctaW4tbmF0dXJlcy1zdHlsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus engineers study the natural world for modern aircraft design solutions

The growing science of biomimicry focuses on what humanity can learn from the world, and Airbus engineers are learning quite a lot about efficient solutions for aircraft design that nature has spent millions of years refining.

The traditional method of helping an aircraft cut through the air is to make every surface as smooth as possible, and the study of sharks suggests that there is even more to be done. Sharks are famed for their speed through the water, but rather than being smooth, sharkskin is covered in small, tooth-like riblets.

For the past two years, certain Airbus jetliners in airline service have been fitted with small ‘riblet’ patches – textured surfaces applied to the fuselages and wings that mimic the effect of sharkskin. These test surfaces have helped to demonstrate that the sharkskin concept is highly suitable for long-range aircraft, since its drag-reducing surface is particularly effective during high-speed cruise flight.

The albatross is also of interest to Airbus engineers: these seafaring birds can cover hundreds of kilometres with hardly a flap of their wings. Airbus engineer Tom Wilson noted that in addition to expertly utilising air currents, the aspect ratio of an albatross’ wings – the measurement of a wing’s span divided by its chord, or width – is significantly greater than the wings of Airbus aircraft today. Seeing the ways in which nature has solved the engineering problems that an aircraft manufacturer faces “gives us the feeling we are asking the right questions,” said Wilson.

Partnerships to further the research

Various departments across Airbus are applying the principles of biomimicry to their work and partnering with others to help advance the science. A publicly-funded research project led by Airbus with Lufthansa Technik and Bremer Werk für Montagesysteme continues to explore the use of sharkskin-like material on aircraft. The research team recently developed a technique that allows fully automated, large-area application of a thin riblet structure to wings, and Airbus is considering the introduction of a sharkskin-like coating to the wings and horizontal tails of A350 XWB jetliners beginning in 2020.

The company’s flight physics team recently ran an event with universities to consider a range of biomimicry applications. This includes a range of technologies ranging from sensors and actuation to modelling of aerodynamics.

Airbus is looking to launch incubation projects to see how bio-inspired insights might be further explored. “We want to see how we can learn from the things around us to potentially resolve the issues we face,” said Lee-Ann Ramcherita, Airbus’ technowatch and innovation manager in flight physics. “Understanding how insects, birds or bats detect and respond to fluctuations in the surrounding air flow may potentially help us identify opportunities to apply on our aircraft.”"

The Dubai-based airline Emirates threw a lifeline on Thursday to the A380, the world’s largest passenger aircraft, putting in a $16 billion order for up to 36 of the planes to be delivered starting from 2020. The agreement, which includes a firm commitment to buy 20 aircraft and an option for 16 more, comes just days after Airbus said it would end production of the A380 if it did not receive more orders.

When Airbus started delivering the A380 a decade ago, it pitched the plane as the future of aviation, offering a solution to airport congestion and to increased demand for international travel. The number of planes that can land at an airport on a given day is limited, the European company argued, so the A380, with the capacity to carry more than 500 passengers, would allow airlines to transport more passengers.

But the bet on the four-engine plane turned out to be a financial disaster for Airbus as the industry increasingly used smaller airports, a shift that favored its main competitor, Boeing, and other manufacturers of midsize aircraft.

Airbus did not book any orders for the A380 last year; in fact, orders for two planes were canceled. The poor performance for the aircraft overshadowed an otherwise decent year for the company. On Monday, John Leahy, Airbus’s chief operating officer, said that if the company was unable to agree on a deal with Emirates, the superjumbo’s days might be numbered."

Total deliveries reached 718 – four percent higher than the previous record

1,109 total net orders from 44 customers; book-to-bill ratio at 1.5

Airbus’ Commercial Aircraft deliveries in 2017 were up for the 15th year in a row, reaching a new company record of 718 aircraft delivered to 85 customers. Deliveries were more than four percent higher than the previous record of 688 set in 2016. The 2017 total comprises: 558 single aisle A320 Family (of which 181 were A320neo – an increase of 166 percent over 2016); 67 A330s; 78 A350 XWBs (up by nearly 60 percent from 2016) and 15 A380s. Furthermore, to cap this resounding annual production achievement, Airbus achieved 1,109 net orders from 44 customers. At the end of 2017 Airbus’ overall backlog stood at 7,265 aircraft valued at US$1.059 trillion at list prices.

Fabrice Brégier, Airbus Chief Operating Officer and President Commercial Aircraft commented: “A new Airbus delivery record coupled with our fifth best order intake wraps up a remarkable year for us. This outstanding achievement is testimony to the dedication of all our teams, and makes the company fitter, stronger and ready for the opportunities ahead.”

With this year’s performance Airbus has steadily built on deliveries year on year – with 15 consecutive years of production increase. From its four A320 Family plants in Hamburg, Tianjin, Mobile, and Toulouse, Airbus is on track to achieve rate 60 per month on single-aisle by mid-2019. Meanwhile, the A350 XWB is equally on track for rate 10 by the end of 2018. Airbus’ healthy order intake in 2017 resulted in a ‘book-to-bill’ ratio of 1.5.

There were many industrial milestones achieved by Airbus Commercial Aircraft in 2017, which included: delivery of the 100th A350 XWB; the delivery of the 50th A320 Family aircraft from our FAL in Mobile; delivery of Emirates’ 100th A380; first flight of the A330neo; certification of the A350-1000; first A321neos delivered with CFM and P&W engines; inauguration of the new A330 Completion and Delivery Centre in Tianjin, China, with two first deliveries; and structural completion of the first Beluga XL. On internationalisation, our partnership with China is expanding while our Americas footprint is equally extended. Moreover, in the provision of services worldwide Airbus is significantly enhancing its local presence to be closer to its customers.

Airbus rolls out first A321neo ACF - Airbus,"Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wMS1haXJidXMtcm9sbHMtb3V0LWZpcnN0LWEzMjFuZW8tYWNm0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New evolution with longer range and higher capacity

Airbus has completed assembly of the first A321neo ACF (Airbus Cabin Flex) at its facilities in Hamburg, Germany. The aircraft, powered by CFM LEAP-1A engines, will undergo ground tests prior to its scheduled first flight in the coming weeks. First delivery of an A321neo ACF to a customer is scheduled for mid-2018.

The A321neo ACF is the latest addition to the successful A320 Family. By applying modifications to the fuselage, the ACF enables more flexible cabin configurations for up to 240 passengers. Compared to the previous A321 variant, the most visible modifications are a new rear section and a modified passenger door configuration, where the door located forward of the wing is removed and new overwing emergency exits in the centre section are introduced. The A321neo ACF is an option today and will become standard for all A321neos around 2020.

The A321neo ACF is the base for a longer range variant known as the A321LR. The A321LR has an increased MTOW (Maximum Take Off Weight) of 97 tonnes and a third underfloor fuel tank allowing airlines to increase its range to 4,000 nautical miles for intercontinental flights. The first delivery of an A321LR is targeted for the fourth quarter of 2018.

The A321 is the largest member of the A320 Family, seating up to 240 passengers, depending on cabin configuration. Incorporating the latest engines, aerodynamic advances and cabin innovations, the A321neo offers a reduction in fuel consumption of at least 15 percent per seat from day one and 20 percent by 2020."
Airbus Values - Airbus,"Tue, 09 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE4LTAxLWFpcmJ1cy12YWx1ZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus Values Journey

Nearly 55,000 employees participated in selecting the company’s six core values; values that are part of its DNA and that reflect what the company means to each employee.

It is Airbus’ belief that its values are best chosen by those who embody them. The company therefore invited its employees to brainstorm a list of principles that would complement the foundations Integrity and We are One, which had been proposed by the executive management team. In an online poll, employees were able to choose from a list of 12 values, or make their own suggestions.

The suggestions which received the most votes, Teamwork, Customer focus, Reliability, Respect and Creativity, were developed further in stage two. This involved more than 120 focus groups, across 17 countries, during which 1290 employees discussed the meaning and behaviours linked to each of the selected values. Later in July 2017, during a collaborative event that brought together over 150 employees representing all areas of the company and all of the Values focus groups, it was suggested to merge, “We Are One”, with the value of “teamwork” to reflect the importance the company places on collaboration and working together.

With its six core values defined, the company has embarked on the journey to live them in everything it does, every day. To support this next phase of the journey, a variety of tools and training sessions have been developed. ""Our ambition is to create a company-wide common and shared understanding around the values, translate them into professional behaviours and embed them in the way we work and relate to our colleagues, customers, suppliers, partners, and stakeholders,” says Thierry Baril, Airbus’ Chief Human Resources Officer.

The six Airbus values

• We feel, act and behave as one large family – We are One – and create an engaging and inclusive workplace that favours wellbeing, fun and trust to drive team work.

• We partner with our customers to deliver valuable and sustainable solutions together.

• Our reliability drives our competences and mindset to deliver on time, on cost and on quality.

• We treat each other and all stakeholders as we wish to be treated, with respect, embracing diversity.

• We are curious, courageous, passionate, open-minded and recognise creativity at all levels.

• We act with integrity and take appropriate consequences to eradicate unethical and non-compliant behaviours."
Airbus to get '10 years of visibility' from Emirates deal: CEO - Phys.org,"Sun, 21 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE4LTAxLWFpcmJ1cy15ZWFycy12aXNpYmlsaXR5LWVtaXJhdGVzLWNlby5odG1s0gFGaHR0cHM6Ly9waHlzLm9yZy9uZXdzLzIwMTgtMDEtYWlyYnVzLXllYXJzLXZpc2liaWxpdHktZW1pcmF0ZXMtY2VvLmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Emirates announced the deal on Thursday to buy 36 Airbus A380s - just days after the group said it would have to halt production without new orders.

A $16 billion deal with Emirates airline for A380 superjumbos will give Airbus ""at least 10 years of visibility"", the European manufacturer's CEO Tom Enders said in an interview published Sunday.

Emirates announced the deal on Thursday to buy 36 Airbus A380s - just days after the group said it would have to halt production without new orders.

The deal is ""excellent news"" and ""a sign of confidence on the part of a company that has built its strategy on growth around the plane"", Enders told France's Journal du Dimanche newspaper.

It ""gives us at least 10 years of visibility.""

Emirates said it had placed firm orders for 20 of the double-decker aircraft with options for a further 16. Deliveries are scheduled to start in 2020.

The airline is already the world's biggest customer for the A380 with 101 in its fleet and 41 more firm orders previously placed.

Airbus hopes that by continuing the programme for the next 10 years or even beyond, potential customers of the A380 will decide to order the aircraft, especially in China.

The group's decision in 2007 to pursue the A380, capable of packing in 853 seats, was diametrically opposed to rival Boeing's bet on the Dreamliner, marketed as a more efficient plane that could be used for both medium and long-distance flights.

But the economics of the four-engine A380 have proved daunting, with airlines having to operate every flight at full capacity in order to make a profit.

Airbus sales director John Leahy had said on Monday that the company would have to halt the A380 programme unless Emirates placed another order.

Enders, 59, told the Airbus board of directors last month that he would not seek reappointment as CEO when his current term ends in April.

NATO buyers to meet with Airbus over billions in A400M fines - Defense News,"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXIvMjAxOC8wMS8yOS9uYXRvLWJ1eWVycy10by1tZWV0LXdpdGgtYWlyYnVzLW92ZXItYmlsbGlvbnMtaW4tYTQwMG0tZmluZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Airbus will meet with several NATO members on Feb. 5 in London to discuss reductions to fines imposed on the company due to delivery delays and failing to meet contract capability requirements for its A400M Atlas military transport aircraft program, Reuters reports.

If Airbus is unable to convince buyer countries to put a cap on financial penalties, the company fears the $21 billion program will be seriously at risk.

Delivering aircraft that fail to meet contracted capability requirements behind schedule have lead buyers like Germany, the program’s largest customer, to withhold full payment. Technical problems in manufacturing, specifically with cracking in the engine’s gearbox, have put the project years behind schedule. As a result, Germany’s share of costs have risen from an expected $10 billion to nearly $12 billion.

Commenting on the program’s financial issues last February, Airbus CEO Tom Enders said the company committed an “original sin” by signing a contract that was “too short on budget and timeline.” Enders said the company made another “incredible blunder” in assuming liability for the engines.

Airbus paid $2.6 billion to cover financial penalties and slow deliveries in 2016, adding to the nearly $6.2 billion the company has paid in penalties since accepting the A400M contract in 2010.

Officials from Belgium, France, Germany Luxemborg, Spain, Turkey and the United Kingdom, as well as Europe’s procurement agency OCCAR, will meet with Airbus in attempt to hash out an agreement capping financial penalties. Airbus received a $4.3 billion bailout from the seven countries in 2010.

Technology breakthrough: Naval Group and Airbus Helicopters responsible for building the first demonstrator of a ... - Airbus,"Thu, 11 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wMS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWJyZWFrdGhyb3VnaC1uYXZhbC1ncm91cC1hbmQtYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris, The DGA (Direction générale de l’armement) has just awarded a contract for technology development in the field of rotary-wing drones to the Naval Group and Airbus Helicopters consortium. The contract covers de-risking studies ahead of construction of a future tactical helicopter drone demonstrator aboard warships. The demonstration project will lead to trials of the drone launch system, mission system and airborne vehicle, conducted from a French Navy vessel.



The purpose of the contract awarded by the DGA is to identify, deploy and test the technologies necessary for the integration of a tactical drone-system capacity within a heavily armed vessel. It forms part of the preparation of the SDAM (Navy Airborne Drone System), whose entry into service is foreseen for the middle of the next decade on new Intermediate-Size Frigates (FTIs) and other French Navy ships.

The study will help select the principal technologies for the SDAM and the identification of the technical risks necessary for initiating and realising the programme. The level of technological maturity sought is that of a demonstrator of the complete system in a representative environment.

Naval Group, European leader for naval defence, and Airbus Helicopters, the world’s leading producer of helicopters, will thus join their complementary competencies and know-how in the naval and aeronautic fields to prepare the French Navy’s future rotary-wing drone system.

The naval integration of aerial drones requires extensive experience of the technical and operational hurdles and the Navy’s missions in order to define robust and evolutive system architectures that help meet every need.

Naval Group and Airbus Helicopters shall be jointly responsible for the industrial project management and shall coordinate wider input from French industry/sector. To this end, Naval Group and Airbus Helicopters shall act as the programme design authority and shall have Hélicoptères Guimbal, Safran, Thales and ONERA as their principal subcontractors.

Twelve years of experience in the naval integration of aerial drones



For Naval Group, drones exchange with the vessel’s combat system and their missions operated keeping in mind information from sensors and the tactical situation of reference from the combat management system. Representing a veritable tactical advantage, the drone forms an integral part of the warship, allowing increased operational potential for naval forces.

Hervé Guillou, President and CEO of Naval Group, indicates: “We are proud to have been selected by the DGA together with our long-standing partner Airbus Helicopters to allow the French Navy to integrate aerial drone systems into its units and strengthen its operational capabilities. This study also allows us to structure a world-leading industrial sector in this field. Naval Group thus confirms its capacity for innovation and technical mastery of naval systems and its role of whole warship architecture in the aero-naval domain.”

Naval Group has already started working on naval integration of aerial drone in 2005. Between this date and today, the DGA has given the group several studies contracts that led to develop this technology (R&D contract IND, R&D contract D2AD, Serval).

VSR700, versatile and robust solution

Based on an innovative, versatile, robust and economical helicopter platform, the VSR700 drone system is being developed by Airbus Helicopters to offer its military clients the best possible combination of multi-role performance, reliability and operating costs. This 700-kg drone, derived from a light civilian helicopter, the Cabri G2, benefits from the technical know-how of Airbus Helicopters in certified autonomous flight systems and naval helicopters. A campaign of autonomous flights was started in June 2017 using an unmanned Cabri G2 prototype to validate the integration of the flight control systems and the vehicle’s new engine system, opening the way for the first flight of the VSR700 in 2018.

“I would like to thank the DGA and the French Navy for the trust they have placed in the VSR700 drone which, thanks to the combined experience of Airbus Helicopters and Naval Group, is expected to play a crucial role in the aero-maritime operation theatres of tomorrow” declared Guillaume Faury, CEO of Airbus Helicopters.

The VSR700 can exceed 10 flight hours of operational autonomy with a payload capacity of up to 150 kg, offering performance levels that have, until now, been the reserve of aircraft of a significantly higher category and size. The system will benefit from all the know-how of Airbus Helicopters in terms of automated flight control (the guarantee of a unique automatic deck-landing capacity in rough seas), autonomous navigation system, secure data link, the integration of sensors such as radar and optronic systems, the management of complex mission systems and the certification of military aircraft. This expertise, which builds on a heritage going back more than 70 years, allows Airbus Helicopters to design a drone system that precisely meets the needs of the French Navy. The aerial vehicle has low maintenance requirements and strong synergies with the ships existing logistical footprint, thus limiting support and operations costs, while its compact size is compatible with the simultaneous use of an on-board helicopter across different surface ships.

Review: Turkish Airlines (Airbus A330-300) Business Class - The Points Guy,"Wed, 17 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS8yMDE4LzAxL3R1cmtpc2gtYTMzMC0zMDAtYnVzaW5lc3MtcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After a great flight on Turkish's 777-300ER from Dubai (DXB), a spectacular two-night stay in Istanbul and an extended visit to Turkish's top-notch business-class lounge at IST, it was time to complete my itinerary with a trip on the other wide-body jet Turkish operates on flights to and from the US, the Airbus A330-300.

Booking

I booked this flight alongside my 777 leg from Dubai to Istanbul (IST) for a total of $2,800, which, while more than I'd normally like to spend, was one of the least-expensive business-class options following the popular Dubai Air Show.

Unfortunately award space never opened up, even though I searched for business awards daily. However, I did earn 6,270 redeemable MileagePlus miles for this leg of the trip — and you can see the complete haul detailed here.

Airport and Lounge

Even though my flight wasn't scheduled to depart until 8:15am, I arrived at IST a bit before 5:00am so I'd have plenty of time to explore the gigantic business-class lounge. Check-in was painless, and I was through security and immigration and on my way to the lounge in about 10 minutes.

The lounge is so sprawling and amenity-packed that I decided to break it out in a separate review, which you can see here.

In short, I enjoyed my visit, but the space became uncomfortably crowded by the time I headed to the gate around 7:00am.

Cabin and Seat

Compared to Turkish's 777, the business-class cabin is far smaller on the A330-300, with just 28 lie-flat seats, 21 fewer than on the 777-300ER.

Seats are arranged in a 2-2-2 configuration, which I prefer to the 2-3-2 you'll find on the 777. Since the A330 cabin is narrower, however, the seats measure 21 inches on this plane, compared to 22 inches on the larger Boeing jet. I didn't notice much of a difference, though.

I selected seat 5B, located on the aisle in the last row of business class.

You may unsubscribe at any time.

As you can see, these A330 seats are even more dated than those I had on the 777 flight — and those were already a step below the industry-standard 1-2-1 arrangement.

There were two lavatories assigned to the business cabin — one up front, near the cockpit, and another near the second door, on the port side of the plane.

Both lavs were especially basic and compact. If you're planning to change, you might want to do so before and after the flight — I really struggled to change into my pajama pants on the plane.

Right away I noticed that these seats offered less privacy than those on the 777, as they're lacking a center divider. That turned out to be a non-issue, since I loved my seatmate, and friends or family members sitting together shouldn't mind. If you're next to an unfriendly stranger the lack of privacy is from from ideal, though.

Otherwise, the seats themselves were nearly identical to those on the 777.

I also appreciated having a small storage nook between the TVs, which isn't available on the 777. I found the storage otherwise inadequate, though.

My seat had the same controls I had on the 777, which meant it was equally challenging to get it into the ideal position — moving to full-flat mode was a cinch, though.

The seat was comfortable in lie-flat mode, though again the lack of privacy might make it challenging to get comfy.

As I mentioned, having a great seatmate made all the difference here.

We chatted off and on throughout the flight using Google Translate, powered by the (generally sluggish) Wi-Fi.

Amenities

The amenity kit was a bit more comprehensive on this leg, and included a dental kit, disposable socks, a shoehorn, brush, eye mask, earplugs and lotion.

The bedding was also a nice treat — a flight attendant came by offering mattress pads shortly after takeoff, and he patiently installed them at each seat. The pillow and blanket were solid as well.

I also liked these noise-canceling headphones better than those on the shorter flight from Dubai, so I ended up using them throughout the flight.

The Wi-Fi was too slow to get much work done, unfortunately, but at $14.99 for the entire flight, it was entirely affordable.

In-Flight Entertainment

The entertainment selection was very good on this leg as well, with the same selection of films and TV shows. The 777 offers a larger display, but I got used to the smaller screen quickly enough.There was a decent mix of new releases, older flicks and Turkish films. I really liked that the IFE system included IMDB ratings, too, since I'd otherwise have had to look those up using the Wi-Fi.

Again, content can be selected using the touchscreen or the (in this case not-quite-up-to-date) wired remote.

There was also an option to view a live camera feed, but I couldn't get it to work at any point during the flight.

Food and Beverage

Of course, the entertainment didn't stop at the IFE screen...

Turkish offers some of the best business-class catering in the world, thanks to its partnership with Do & Co. I was even impressed with the menu, which the onboard chef delivered to everyone herself.Since this was a morning flight, a flight attendant came by with a mix of breakfast-appropriate beverages before we left the gate.

I had the limonata again, since I liked that so much on the flight from Dubai. Then, about an hour after takeoff the first breakfast course was served. The menu included an order form with checkboxes, but a flight attendant took our order verbally.

First up was a selection of appetizers, including a mix of turkey and cheese, a fruit salad, small vegetable salad, honeycomb, butter and a tomato spread with walnuts.

We were offered warm bread moments later as well.

I was a bit surprised to find dirty silverware when I opened up my napkin, though. It wasn't a big deal since I had a second knife, but I would have expected a bit more attention to detail at Turkish's main catering facility.

There was a hot entree as well — I went with the Gozleme pastry, which was fantastic.

Then, after the first meal a flight attendant set up a snack bar at the front of the cabin, just ahead of seats 1D and E. This was actually a high-traffic area throughout the flight, so I'd avoid picking a seat in row 1 if you can help it. My seat in row 5 was also a bit too noisy, with a lot of activity in the galley just behind.

The crew turned the lights on about three hours before landing, and a few minutes later I was offered my choice of beverage with a bowl of nuts.

Then, 30 minutes after that a flight attendant came through to set up the tables for the pre-arrival meal, which actually turned out to be more substantial than the breakfast.

Turkish sets up a small LED light on each tray on longer flights, which, while entirely unnecessary, seemed to be a nice touch.

Five minutes later I was offered my choice of appetizer — since I was the last to be served and there were plenty left on the cart, I asked for both.

The presentation was excellent here — aside from the silverware issue at breakfast.

I was offered a main course just 15 minutes later, and went with the swordfish, which was surprisingly moist and well-prepared.

About 90 minutes after the second meal service began, it was time for dessert. I asked for the chocolate mousse and panna cotta, which were both very good.

Finally, I ended the meal with a delicious Turkish coffee.

Overall Impression

Aside from the excellent service and my phenomenal seatmate, the amazing Do & Co catering was, without a doubt, the highlight of this flight. There was plenty of food, and it was some of the best I've had in business class.

Overall, I was underwhelmed by Turkish's cabin and seat in general. I wasn't expecting much, given the 2-2-2 configuration, but this product was among the least private I've experienced in biz — and on such an otherwise excellent airline, the lack of privacy was a real letdown. That said, while I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to fly Turkish's A330 again, I did have a better experience with the 777 hard product, and I'm sure I'll be back on Turkish sooner than later."

The softening of the global helicopter market was reflected in new orders, slipping to 335 units from 353 a year ago.

The total order book stood at 692 helicopters at the end of 2017.

The company is flight-testing the H160, a civil helicopter being studied for military missions for the French forces.

“Last year saw major progress being made on new products including the H160 — the first of the ‘H Generation’ — with three prototypes now in flight testing ahead of certification in 2019,” the company said in a statement.

A firing campaign with a number of weapons was conducted on the H145M, the company said. The helicopter will be fitted with “improved and modular military capabilities by the end of 2018.”

That light helicopter is an armed version of the UH-72A Lakota, of which 400 were delivered to the U.S. Army.

Last year saw a first phase completed in seeking to become “stronger and leaner in a challenging market environment,” the company said. This year will see a second step with an “increased digitalization of our products, services and operations — for the benefit of our customers and the safety of our fleet.”

France last year picked the H160 for detailed military study, with a program due to launch next year to equip the Air Force, Army and Fleet Air Arm. An order of 160 to 190 units is expected.

Airbus Helicopters CEO Guillaume Faury is due to leave the rotorcraft division to take up the post of head of the Airbus commercial jetliner business based in Toulouse, southwestern France."

Emirates is already the world's biggest customer for the A380 with 101 in its fleet and 41 more firm orders previously placed.

""This order will provide stability to the A380 production line,"" the airline's chairman and CEO Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al-Maktoum said.

""We've made no secret of the fact that the A380 has been a success for Emirates,"" he said in a statement.

""Our customers love it, and we've been able to deploy it on different missions across our network, giving us flexibility in terms of range and passenger mix.""

The Dubai-based airline said that with the new order it will have commitments for a total of 178 A380s worth $60 billion.

The deal was expected to be signed during the Dubai Airshow in November but was delayed without any explanation amid reports of tough negotiations.

Instead, Emirates inked a deal to buy 40 Boeing Dreamliners for more than $15 billion.

Airbus's decision in 2007 to pursue the A380, capable of packing in 853 seats, was diametrically opposed to Boeing's bet on the Dreamliner, marketed as a more efficient plane that could be used for both medium and long-distance flights.

But the economics of the four-engine A380 have proved daunting, with airlines having to operate every flight at full capacity in order to make a profit.

'It buys Airbus time'

Airbus warned on Monday that it might have to end production of the A380, having booked no new orders for the plane in two years.

The Emirates order should see the A-380 programme through the next decade or more

It said it regarded Emirates as the only airline with the capacity to place an order of the size required to keep production going.

""Quite honestly, if we can't work out a deal with Emirates there is no choice but to shut down the programme,"" Airbus sales director John Leahy said Monday.

The company said it needed to build at least six of the aircraft per year for the programme to remain viable.

On Thursday, Leahy seemed relieved that Airbus' strategy of staring down Emirates appeared to have paid off, saying the programme was now good to go on for at least another decade.

""This new order underscores Airbus' commitment to produce the A380 at least for another ten years. I'm personally convinced more orders will follow Emirates' example and that this great aircraft will be built well into the 2030s,"" Leahy said.

Airbus is hoping China will lead a revival in orders once demand for long-haul planes picks up, arguing that the plane is ideally suited for mass-market travel and for heavily congested airports.

Emirates operates a fleet of 269 wide-bodied aircraft and flies to 157 destinations.

Airbus said it has delivered 222 A380s to 13 airlines so far.

Stock market investors welcomed the news of the order, pushing Airbus shares more than two percent higher on the Paris bourse in mid-session business.

Calling the deal ""a relief for Airbus"", independent commercial aviation expert John Strickland said it probably saved the A-380 programme.

""Without it, production would likely have been terminated,"" Strickland said.

""It is not a guarantee of financial success for the programme but buys Airbus time to go out and secure additional orders from other airlines,"" he said.

The future of the Airbus A380 superjumbo could rest on just one country - CNBC,"Mon, 08 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTgvMDEvMDgvY2hpbmEtaG9sZHMta2V5LXRvLWZ1dHVyZS1vZi1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1zdXBlcmp1bWJvLmh0bWzSAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAxOC8wMS8wOC9jaGluYS1ob2xkcy1rZXktdG8tZnV0dXJlLW9mLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLXN1cGVyanVtYm8uaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An employee works on an Airbus A380 plane inside the Air France KLM maintenance hangar at the Charles de Gaulle International Airport in Roissy, near Paris, France, May 31, 2016.

Hugely popular with passengers but less so with airlines, after just 10 years in the sky, the A380 superjumbo is struggling to find buyers.

The France-based manufacturer is reportedly offering China an industrial partnership with the company if Beijing places orders for its largest passenger jet. Airbus Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier is in China to hold talks after traveling to the country as part of French President Emmanuel Macron's trade mission.

Rami Myerson, an analyst at Investec, said Monday that there had been speculation for some time that Beijing will invest in the struggling superjumbo.

""There is a view that aircraft and airspace are becoming more and more congested and given the strong growth in China that could be an attractive plane for the country,"" he said.

Airbus currently has fewer than 100 Airbus A380s on its production line and it is expected that some of these orders will be canceled.

It had hoped to announce a fresh deal for at least 30 more A380s with top customer Emirates at the Dubai Airshow in November, but that never happened and negotiations appear to have stalled.

Emirates has expressed concern that, with few other customers, Airbus may not be able to fulfill its delivery promise."

The 2017 total comprises: 558 single aisle A320 Family (of which 181 were A320neo – an increase of 166 percent over 2016); 67 A330s; 78 A350 XWBs (up by nearly 60 percent from 2016) and 15 A380s.

In addition, a string of orders in the final few weeks of the year pushed its total orders to 1,109 from 44 customers.

By comparison, rival Boeing recorded 763 deliveries in 2017 and 912 net orders.

Significant wins for Airbus included private equity fund Indigo Partners finalising an order for 430 additional A320neo Family aircraft for ultra-low-cost airlines Frontier Airlines (United States), JetSMART (Chile), Volaris (Mexico) and Wizz Air (Hungary).

The purchase agreement followed a Memorandum of Understanding among the parties announced at the Dubai Air Show in November. The 430-aircraft order is made up of 274 A320neos and 156 A321neos worth $49.5bn at list prices.

“A new Airbus delivery record coupled with our fifth best order intake wraps up a remarkable year for us,” said Fabrice Brégier, Airbus chief operating officer.

“This outstanding achievement is testimony to the dedication of all our teams, and makes the company fitter, stronger and ready for the opportunities ahead.”

From its four A320 Family plants in Hamburg, Tianjin, Mobile, and Toulouse, Airbus said it remains on track to achieve rate 60 per month on single-aisle by mid-2019.

At the end of 2017, Airbus’ overall backlog stood at 7,265 aircraft valued at $1.059trn at list prices."
"Airbus overtakes Boeing, says could halt A380 programme (Update) - Phys.org","Mon, 15 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE4LTAxLWFpcmJ1cy1mbGllcy1ib2VpbmctYWlyY3JhZnQuaHRtbNIBPmh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE4LTAxLWFpcmJ1cy1mbGllcy1ib2VpbmctYWlyY3JhZnQuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus said that without new orders from Dubai-based airline, Emirates, it will be forced to halt its A380 programme

European aerospace giant Airbus overtook arch-rival Boeing in terms of aircraft orders last year, but warned that it could cease making its A380 jet if it does not receive any more orders for the supersize plane.

Airbus said it booked a total 1,109 aircraft orders and a record 718 deliveries in 2017.

By comparison, US rival Boeing booked 912 orders and 763 deliveries.

Chief operating officer Fabrice Bregier said that overall deliveries could rise to 800 this year, given the increased pace of production of its A320neo aircraft.

The medium-haul A320neo and A321neo jets feature new generation engines that use 15 percent less fuel compared to their peers.

""We are going to double the number of A320neos"" delivered this year, Bregier told a news conference. ""If we do that, we will be close to 800 deliveries in 2018.""

He acknowledged that deliveries of the A320neo had been slowed last year by problems with the engines made by US firm Pratt & Withney and by CFM, the joint venture of General Electric and Safran.

Nevertheless, the problems were gradually being resolved and around 30 aircraft were waiting for their engines, down from 60 at the beginning of the year, he said.

Turning to the A380, sales director, John Leahy, warned that Airbus would have no choice but to halt the programme if Dubai's Emirates airline—the main customer for the superjumbo launched in 2007—did not place another order.

""We are still talking to Emirates, but honestly, they are probably the only one to have the ability right now on the market place to take a minimum of six per year on a period of eight to 10 years,"" Leahy said.

""Quite honestly, if we can't work out a deal with Emirates there is no choice but to shut down the programme,"" Leahy said.

""But I'm hopeful that we work out a deal with Emirates,"" he added.

There have been a total of 317 orders for the A380, the world's largest passenger airliner, since its launch.

Airbus had been hoping to secure another major order from Emirates, which took delivery of its 100th A380 in 2017, at the Dubai Air Show in November.

But the airline finally picked 40 Boeing 787-10 jets instead.

Lower trajectory

COO Bregier said the ""trajectory will be to go lower"" in production of the A380.

""We will deliver 12 aircraft as planned in 2018,"" and the number could fall to six per year in subsequent years, Bregier said.

""The challenge will be to maintain at least this level in the years to come"" before customers start placing replacement orders for the A380s they currently have in service, and ""potential new markets"" start opening up, he said.

Turning to Airbus' overall performance last year, the planemaker insisted that commercial aircraft deliveries in 2017 ""were up for the 15th year in a row, reaching a new company record.""

At the end of 2017, Airbus' overall backlog stood at 7,265 aircraft valued at $1.059 trillion (867 billion euros) at list prices, the company said.

""A new Airbus delivery record coupled with our fourth best order intake wraps up a remarkable year for us,"" Bregier insisted.

Airbus readies to ramp up sim training at newly acquired Aurora center - Runway Girl Network,"Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTgvMDEvYWlyYnVzLXJlYWRpZXMtdG8tcmFtcC11cC1zaW0tdHJhaW5pbmctYXQtbmV3bHktYWNxdWlyZWQtYXVyb3JhLWNlbnRlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Having acquired Denver area flight training center Strategic Simulation Solutions, Airbus is gearing up to add A320 simulator capacity in the next 24 months to address an anticipated boost in demand.

But the airframer tells Runway Girl Network it is also eyeing the addition of other aircraft simulator types “as demand drives requirements”.

Airbus forecasts a need for 122,000 new pilots in the Americas by 2035, representing 23% of the world’s demand. “We want our Airbus flight training facilities to be easily accessible to our customers regardless of their location, hence this latest move,” explains Laurent Martinez, head of services by Airbus,.

At present, Aurora, Colorado-based Strategic Simulation Solutions supports A320 operator Frontier Airlines’ pilot training with two A320 family, FAA Level D full flight simulators.

The facility has ample room for growth, not only to accommodate the additional sims, but also to bring Airbus’ comprehensive, high fidelity maintenance training on board. The so-called Airbus ACT Suite can be set up within a week’s notice, if Airbus sees the need.

A long term on-site solution (five years renewable), the ACT Suite has been built around Airbus Competence Training (ACT), a learning-by-doing approach based on a combination of theoretical and practical training, supported by state-of-the-art virtual tools. Active learning in a virtual aircraft environment is introduced at an early stage of the training.

Various courses can be delivered through the ACT concept including type-rating and difference courses, recurrent training, specialized courses and practical training on device. “Over recent years, it has proved its efficiency by certifying thousands of maintenance personnel and engineers from all over the world,” says the Airbus spokesman, adding, “Thanks to this concept, real time practice on aircraft is reduced by half.”

Prior to Airbus’ acquisition of privately-held Strategic Simulation Solutions, the airframer has provided training to the North American region primarily from its Miami, Florida-based center, which offers a range of full-flight simulators and computer-based training programs. Each year, the Miami center hosts some 1,500 air crew members from Airbus customer airlines.

The addition of the Aurora facility – which Airbus is calling its first US west coast training center – will help meet long-term growth in expanding markets throughout the Americas. This market is also served with training centers in Mexico City, Mexico and in Campinas, Brazil. At worldwide level, Airbus has more than tripled its training locations in only three years, to a total of 17 locations.

Airbus doesn’t have a preferred simulator provider. “As for simulator manufacturer, Airbus does not prefer one provider over another but rather chooses the equipment based on specific technical requirements,” says the spokesman.

Asked if Airbus intends to implement any diversity programs at the Aurora facility, which would help to attract women and minorities, he says, “As the acquisition itself has just been finalized, this aspect has not yet been fully evaluated. However, Airbus has a commitment to diversity among its workforce and its supplier network, and has already launched a series of diversity programs globally.”

Emirates Throws Airbus A380 a Lifeline With $16 Billion Deal - Voice of America - VOA News,"Thu, 18 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvZW1pcmF0ZS1haXJidXMtMzgwLzQyMTMyMjAuaHRtbNIBO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9lbWlyYXRlLWFpcmJ1cy0zODAvNDIxMzIyMC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Middle East's largest airline, Emirates, announced Thursday it struck a deal with Airbus to purchase 20 A380 aircraft with the option to buy 16 more in a deal worth $16 billion, throwing a lifeline to the European-made double-decker jumbo jets.



The Dubai-based Emirates already has 101 A380s in its fleet and 41 more on order, making it the largest operator of the jumbo jet.



""This new order underscores Airbus' commitment to produce the A380 at least for another ten years,"" said Airbus chief salesman John Leahy.



""This order will provide stability to the A380 production line,"" Emirates Chairman and Chief Executive Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said in a statement after the deal was signed in Dubai on Thursday morning.



Emirates, which is owned by the Dubai government in the United Arab Emirates, said the additional A380s will be delivered to the airliner from 2020 onwards and that some of the new A380s will be used as fleet replacements.



Airbus chief salesman John Leahy had warned only three days earlier that if the company couldn't work out a deal with Emirates, it would have to shut down the superjumbo's production line. Airbus has spent years and billions developing the double-decker jumbo jet, even as skeptics questioned whether it could generate enough demand to justify its cost and the bigger runways it requires.



An Airbus A380 has a list price of $445.6 million, but airlines and manufacturers often negotiate lower prices.



Airbus delivered just 15 of the planes last year, and aims to deliver 12 more this year.



Leahy told reporters Monday that Emirates is the only airline with the ability to commit to a minimum of six planes a year for a minimum of eight to 10 years, or what is needed to make the Airbus program viable.



""It's positive news for both sides,"" airline analyst John Strickland of JLS Consulting said. ""The A380 is critical to Emirates' hub-and-growth strategy and equally the airline is key to Airbus' continuation of the program. It will be a great relief to Airbus to have secured this order, but they have to work aggressively to secure orders from other airlines too now.""



Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum said the deal reflects Emirates' commitment to advancing ``Dubai's vision to grow further as a world-class destination and aviation hub.'' Dubai's main airport, where Emirates is based, is among the busiest in the world with more than 80 million travelers passing through in 2016.



Airbus tweeted news of the deal, saying it was ""glad to announce"" Emirates' commitment to the A380.



Shares in Airbus rose on the news of the deal, gaining 2.2 percent on the day, to 91.67 euros in Paris.



At Dubai's biennial Air Show in November, Airbus suffered an embarrassment when it was scheduled to announce it had a struck a deal with Emirates for its A380, only to see Boeing sit on the podium with the airline and sign a $15.1 billion deal.



Emirates' fleet relies solely on the Airbus 380 and the Boeing 777 for its flights."

· Solid commercial performance of heavy and super-medium helicopters

· First wave of company-wide transformation completed

Marignane, Airbus Helicopters delivered 409 rotorcraft and logged gross orders for 350 helicopters (net: 335) in 2017, with a strong commercial performance on the heavy and super-medium segments. The company booked 54 orders for helicopters of the Super Puma family and 19 orders for the super-medium H175, confirming those types as best-sellers on their respective market segments. Bookings also included 168 orders for light-single engine helicopters and 105 orders for the H135/H145 light-twins. At the end of 2017, the overall backlog stood at 692 helicopters.

“We are now closing the first chapter of the company-wide transformation launched in 2014, which has allowed us to become stronger and leaner in a challenging market environment. Our 2017 results are a testimony to the great work done by our teams to transform our industrial operations, improve our products & services, while delivering an ambitious innovation roadmap to prepare the future of vertical flight”, said Guillaume Faury, Airbus Helicopters Chief Executive Officer. “As we launch a second wave of company transformation this year, our main focus will be to speed up these efforts through increased digitalisation of our products, services and operations – for the benefit of our customers and the safety of our fleet”.

Last year saw major progress being made on new products, including the H160 – first of the “H Generation” – with three prototypes now in flight-testing ahead of certification in 2019. A full-scale firing campaign of the HForce weapon system was also carried out successfully on the H145M, which will benefit from improved and modular military capabilities by the end of 2018. The year was also marked by the launch of ACH (Airbus Corporate Helicopters) through which the company is able to offer high quality design and specifications across its range of helicopters to private and business customers.

In 2017, Airbus Helicopters completed the implementation of its revamped industrial model with the inauguration of its blade production facility in Paris-Le Bourget, which will be fully part of the new site specialisation strategy integrating the Marignane, Donauwörth and Albacete plants. On the international stage, the company delivered the 400th UH-72 Lakota to the US Army and broke ground on its first helicopter final assembly line in China, with initial deliveries expected in 2019.

"NMA market sector is small, Airbus’ Leahy says - Leeham News and Analysis","Wed, 03 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxOC8wMS8wMy9ubWEtbWFya2V0LXNlY3Rvci1zbWFsbC1haXJidXMtbGVhaHktc2F5cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This is a continuing series of articles derived from LNC’s “retirement” interview with John Leahy, COO-Customers of Airbus. Leahy retires this month.

Jan. 3, 2018, © Leeham Co.: This is the year many expect Boeing to decide whether to launch the New Midmarket Aircraft, also known as NMA or unofficially, the

797, to serve the Middle of the Market.

The MOM sector is broadly defined as above the Boeing 737/Airbus A321 and below the Boeing 787/Airbus A330-200/800.

Others, including LNC define the market more broadly.

NMA market demand in dispute

Regardless, the size of the market is in dispute. Boeing publicly says the market is between 2,000 and 4,000 aircraft over 20 years. At its investors day last September at its 787 Charleston assembly plant, officials told aerospace analysts the market was closer to 4,000.

Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce and Leeham Co. estimate the market at between 2,000 to 2,500. Airbus remained coy about its market forecast, until John Leahy, COO-Customers, spoke with LNC for his “retirement interview” last month.

Airbus sees the demand at about 2,000 airplanes, Leahy said—not enough to justify a new airplane.

‘We have it covered’

Leahy argues, as he has for several years, that Airbus already has the MOM sector covered with the A330-800 and the A321neo.

LNC posted a report on the Airbus strategy for the A330-800 before our interview with Leahy.

The A330-800 “takes the world by storm,” he says, speaking of its potential but not its orders–of which there are virtually none. “It is a MOM. That’s the size of airplane you want. If you want a big single-aisle, it’s the A321LR, or it could even be an A321-Plus at some point in the not too distant future, in 2022, 23, 24, right about the time they’re talking about bringing out a MOM.

“If you bring out an an-new, clean-sheet airplane, you’re taking a market there that is probably 2,000 airplanes. It’s not 4,000, and you’re spending $15bn to develop the airplane. You’ve got to amortize that and every airline is telling you $55m to $75m is all we’re going to pay for this light twin. You’ve got the engine guys telling you the engines are going to be very expensive. The numbers just don’t work.”

Leahy predicts Boeing will reengine the 767. Boeing has studied this option, but LNC doesn’t believe there is enough demand to reengine an airplane with limited market potential for a design that is already 40 years old.

Leading technology for the NSA?

Market intelligence has long suggested the NMA will be the lead technology for the 737 replacement, the NSA or New Small Airplane. Boeing openly boasts it takes technology from one airplane program and “harvests” it to subsequent ones. The wing from the 787 is now in its fourth generation with the 777X, for example.

The NSA would follow by two years the NMA, according to market intelligence. But Leahy is skeptical.

“If I were on their board, I wouldn’t fall for that trick, which is ‘we’re not doing the new single aisle now but we’ll do it later, so let’s lose money now on this middle of the market airplane, but we’ll have the technology for later.’

“I don’t think any reasonable board would go for that,” Leahy said. “I could see how some people in Seattle would dream that. If you were launching a new single aisle at the same time, maybe you could talk about the synergies and say, ‘we’ll really pretend the market is 5,000 or 6,000 and we’ll amortize very little on each unit to keep the price low, because if we’re going to end up using this technology later, that means writing off this money now.’ I don’t think the board will do that.”

(The interview was conducted before word leaked, on Dec. 21, that Boeing and Embraer are in talks about a combination, the nature of which was not revealed. A combination could change the dynamics of the single-aisle replacement strategy.)

Bernstein Research thinks Boeing will abandon the NMA, keeping the basic twin-aisle, ovoid concept but down-sizing the range from 4,500nm-5,000nm to no more than 4,000nm to become the 737 replacement.

Replacement for single aisle

Leahy sees the replacements for the 737 and A320 families around 2030 or a couple of years later.

“It’s really the engine technology,” he said. “You’ve got a neo and MAX that are 15%-20% better than the 321ceo. You’re going to have to be 15% to 20% better than [the neo]. That requires real breakthroughs of engine technology. That may be unducted fans, etc. You can’t spend $15bn for an all-new, single-aisle airplane and take today’s technology engines and hang it underneath it. You’ll be 5% better than you are today.”

Leahy said that’s what Airbus looked at with the neo. A clean sheet of paper and an unlimited budget only gave Airbus 5% better on the airframe; the rest came from the engine.

“Boeing is looking at the same number.”

The next new engine is likely to be an unducted fan or a shrouded fan that gives 15% better economics than today’s engines, which when coupled with 5% improvements in the airframe, give the 20% needed to be a “game-changing” airplane, he said.

Airbus A380 cabin enablers fail to lure new operators for the type - Runway Girl Network,"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTgvMDEvYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtY2FiaW4tZW5hYmxlcnMtZmFpbC10by1sdXJlLW5ldy1vcGVyYXRvcnMtZm9yLXRoZS10eXBlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus’ revelation this morning that it is relying on forging a new deal with A380 operator Emirates to keep the flagship program alive signals that the European airframer’s cabin densification project has not yet proven enticing enough for brand new operators to order the type.

To be sure, some current A380 operators are eyeing the “cabin enabler” options on offer from Airbus. For instance, Air France last year revealed it is studying an 11-abreast configuration for the main deck when it retrofits its A380s in the 2020 timeframe, and noted, “We are not the only one. Many of us [A380 operators] are looking at it.”

But the cabin enablers haven’t revitalized new sales of the A380.

Leahy on #A380: ""Quite honestly if we can't get a deal with @emirates we will have to shut down the programme"" — Max Kingsley-Jones (@MaxK_J) January 15, 2018

In addition to the 11-abreast option for a 3-5-3 configuration in the lower deck, Airbus is offering a new rear stair option which can be combined with a new galley module or offered in standalone form. A new forward stair would remove the signature sweeping staircase of the A380. All of these cabin enablers would aid in the densification of the aircraft, driving better economics out of the super jumbos.

When these options were formally offered last year, Dr. Kiran Rao, EVP of strategy and marketing at Airbus, made clear that they were aimed at current A380 operators, saying it’s a “smart” way to improve the economics while “innovating” in passenger comfort.

But he also noted that:

Only the A380 has the economies of scale and development potential to efficiently solve the problem of increasing congestion at large airports while providing the best comfort for passengers. The aircraft can also serve fast growing markets and airlines regional airports, so we are adapting the aircraft to meet evolving market needs.

A total 15 A380s were delivered by Airbus in 2017, which is in line with Airbus’ revised delivery guidance last year; 12 A380s are expected to be delivered this year, and that number will drop again in 2019. Emirates still has 41 A380s on order with Airbus. But if no new deal transpires – to tide over Airbus with a production rate of roughly six per year until congested airports of the future create a greater need for the super jumbo – the company could stop the program altogether, multiple media outlets are reporting this morning.

Bregier: “On #A380 we have a commercial challenge”. 15 delivered in 17, 12 in 18 and then heading down to 6 — Max Kingsley-Jones (@MaxK_J) January 15, 2018

Though the A380 has been seen as being on life support for some time, Airbus’ comments will nonetheless be a disappointment for major suppliers to the A380 program, including Germany’s Diehl Aerosystems, which last year expressed hope that airlines would embrace the new options being made available by Airbus to enhance efficiency of the double-decker aircraft.

Diehl supplies the A380’s doors and slide management system, slat flat control computer, and cabin lighting, and its joint venture with Thales developed core avionics for the type. While production cuts affect the firm, Diehl stressed it remains flexible, and can ramp up again to support higher volumes for Airbus should the need ever arise in the future.

The niggling bit about the A380’s seemingly dire prospects is that passengers quite simply love the aircraft. It is “absolutely the best long-haul ride ever,” declared one commenter on Twitter this morning. But despite the positive #PaxEx reviews, airlines aren’t buying.

That’s not to say Airbus didn’t have good news to report this morning. In 2017, Airbus achieved record performance by delivering 718 total aircraft “married with its fifth largest order intake of 1,109 jets”, said the firm. Alas, it saw no new orders for the A380 in 2017 or indeed in 2016.

Citing “a lack of maturity in the supply chain” to deliver on some “disruptive technologies” envisioned for a Super Puma replacement, Airbus Helicopters CEO Guillaume Faury says the company will not proceed until solutions are found. He also mentioned “uncertain market demand” for heavy helicopters in passenger transport.

Yet, 2017 was a very good year for the Super Puma family, with 54 military and parapublic orders. But the structure of the market has evolved more deeply than anticipated, in Airbus Helicopters’ view.

In offshore oil-and-gas, the downturn is the new normal. And the sustainability of the military and parapublic market is unsure, Faury believes. Therefore, the necessary conditions are not thought to be fulfilled for a program launch.

Airbus chief salesman John Leahy said Monday that the company would shut production of the aircraft if Emirates, the largest operator of the A380, won't commit to ordering more planes beyond the 41 aircraft it still has on order. To make the program viable, Leahy said Airbus would need to produce six A380s a year for a minimum of eight to 10 years and that Emirates is the only airline that could help it reach that goal.

Over the last decade, Emirates has kept the A380 program aloft almost singlehandedly. It uses its 101 A380s to fly passengers to Dubai and then to some other destination offering up the plane's posh amenities like premium class suites and onboard showers. With room for around 544 seats, the A380 is popular with passengers, but for most airlines it's more airplane than they need (the price for each A380 starts at $437 million).

Conceived in the 1990s when the economy was soaring and long-distance air travel largely shuttled passengers between megahub cities like London and Singapore, the A380 flew into a different world when the first aircraft finally entered service in 2007 after a series of production delays.

The 2008 financial crisis coupled with changing airline business models -- smaller aircraft like the Boeing 787 and Airbus's own A350 can fly fewer passengers between smaller cities and for less money -- caused demand for the A380 to be less than anticipated.

Airbus had initially projected 1,200 deliveries over two decades, but as of December it has delivered only 222 aircraft to 13 airlines with 95 orders still left to fill.

First published Jan. 17 at 8:50 a.m. PT

Updated Jan. 18 at 4:08 a.m. PT: Emirates confirmed today that it would order 36 additional A380s for a total cost of $16 billion. deliveries of the new aircraft will start in 2020.

Airbus gets order for 20 of its A380s - Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette,"Fri, 19 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDE4L2phbi8xOS9haXJidXMtZ2V0cy1vcmRlci1mb3ItMjAtb2YtaXRzLWEzODBzLTIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus pulled its flagship A380 superjumbo back from the brink with a follow-up order from Emirates airline, giving the giant jet a new lease on life days after the plane-maker floated the possibility of killing it off during slack demand.

The Dubai-based carrier, already the biggest A380 customer, signed an outline agreement for 20 of the double-deckers with an option to buy 16 more, worth a potential $16 billion at list prices, it said Thursday, handing Airbus the first orders for the model in more than two years.

The purchase will extend A380 production until 2029 if Emirates takes all of the planes, according to Airbus, which as recently as Monday had acknowledged that the program could be terminated without a new sale soon. The carrier had scuttled a deal for the same number of aircraft toward the end of last year over doubts about the manufacturer's dedication to improving the plane.

""This new order underscores Airbus' commitment to produce the A380 at least for another 10 years,"" John Leahy, the Toulouse, France-based company's outgoing sales chief, said in a statement. ""I'm personally convinced more orders will follow Emirates' example.""

The new aircraft will be delivered from 2020, with engine options still under evaluation. Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC is supplying turbines as part of Emirates' previous order for 50 A380s, while the Engine Alliance of General Electric and Pratt & Whitney powered the previous 90.

If Emirates signs off on the full deal, it will have committed to 178 A380s, or more than half of all orders for the plane worldwide. The carrier currently has 101 superjumbos in its fleet, and many older aircraft will have been phased out before the new batch arrives.

Airbus' failure to land the order in November at the Dubai Air Show left the manufacturer red-faced, with Emirates pulling out just minutes before an announcement was due as dignitaries were gathering for the event. Salvaging the deal will be especially important to Leahy, allowing him to deliver a final coup before standing down as sales chief next week.

The plane-maker and airline have developed an almost symbiotic relationship around the A380. Emirates has given the superjumbo a public profile it would otherwise have struggled to attain, while the 550-seat jet has enabled the carrier to divert a significant proportion of global traffic through what's a natural global crossroads but which was for so long an aviation backwater.

For Airbus, the deal will avoid an early shutdown of its most prominent program, the oldest examples from which are barely 10 years old. The company is also keen to keep the A380 going in anticipation of the global travel market favoring bigger planes in years to come as the number of people flying climbs and runways become more and more crowded.

Emirates Chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, who signed the deal with Leahy in Dubai, said his company now will work with Airbus ""to further enhance the aircraft and onboard product.""

The option component of the order may give Emirates leverage to press for enhancements possibly up to a version of the plane with different engines, Jefferies International analyst Sandy Morris said in a note. The Persian Gulf carrier previously dangled the possibility of as many as 200 orders if Airbus agreed to develop the new engine option or Neo, only for the manufacturer and Rolls-Royce to push back against the proposal.

A spokesman for London-based Rolls-Royce said it welcomes the opportunity to ""be selected again by Emirates,"" while declining to comment further.

As of the end of last year, Airbus had 95 unfilled A380 orders, though only 48 of those, the vast bulk from Emirates, can be regarded as credible, according to Morris. Orders from carriers including Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. have sat on the books undelivered for years.

Airbus tests laminar flow wing - Aerospace Testing International,"Wed, 17 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9zcGFjZXRlc3RpbmdpbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLmNvbS92aWRlb3MvYWlyYnVzLXRlc3RzLWxhbWluYXItZmxvdy13aW5nLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Blade runner

A new flight test project led by Airbus spearheads an EU effort to see if laminar-flow wings can be produced on an industrial scale

Airbus is busy performing the first element of a 150-hour flight test program with an A340-300 modified with natural laminar-flow (NLF) outer-wing sections that could lead to a significant reduction in drag and consequent fuel consumption. After a September 26 first flight, the manufacturer planned to fly the A340BLADE (Breakthrough Laminar Aircraft Demonstrator in Europe) test aircraft two or three times a week in October and slightly less often in November.

Ahead of the 3 hour 38 minute first flight, from Tarbes in southern France (where the aircraft had been modified) to the Airbus Flight and Integration Test Centre in Toulouse, a 10-strong team of pilots and test and flight test engineers spent several months training in a simulator to familiarize themselves with planned flight test instrumentation (FTI). A much larger working party of 70 performed the 16-month FTI cabin installation in Tarbes, while Airbus teams from Bremen, Germany, and Broughton, UK, worked to fit the A340BLADE demonstrator’s outer wings. Another German team installed an infrared camera pod on the fin.

The A340BLADE is “the first test aircraft to combine a transonic laminar-wing profile with a true internal primary structure”, says Airbus. Laminar – or streamline – flow relates to the boundary layer of air that follows the shape of the aerofoil until disrupted by surface contaminants and other factors that generate turbulence, reducing lift and increasing drag.

During the first test flight, engineers were able to observe areas of laminar flow on both new wings during what was mainly a shakedown flight for aircraft and instrumentation. The flight saw the A340BLADE achieve a speed of Mach 0.78 and cruise and maximum altitudes of 32,000ft. “We achieved our objective to fly at the design Mach number, at a reasonable altitude, and check everything was fine,” reports flight test engineer Philippe Seve. “We checked that the FTI was working as expected, to identify further fine-tuning for the next flights.”

By mid-October, the machine – which is the company’s original A340-300 prototype (MSN001) – had made two more flights to confirm the low- and high-speed flight envelope, including stalls and flutter.

Initial flying scheduled for completion this year includes assessing aircraft-handling qualities, extending the flight envelope, and taking first measurements of laminar-wing performance, according to Airbus Research and Technology senior vice president Axel Flaig. A second round of flights in 2018 is planned to “extensively test and characterize laminarity robustness in representative operational conditions”.

The campaign is primarily intended “to validate the area of laminarity that can be achieved for a large variety of cruise-flight conditions with respect to altitude, Mach number and wing loading”, according to the Clean Sky joint undertaking, an EU research program that aims to reduce aircraft CO2, gas and noise emissions.

Fateful eight

Clean Sky’s swept-wing future aircraft (SWFA) integrated technology demonstrator program, of which BLADE is a part, addresses integration of related new technologies for large aircraft. The JU says that demonstrating an NLF ‘smart’ wing with associated advanced FTI equipment represents the first of eight technology streams in the SFWA flight-demonstration work package.

“For a typical short- to medium-range aircraft, the calculated drag benefit is up to 8% at typical Mach 0.75 cruise flight, which translates to around 4.5% fuel-burn reduction for a typical mission,” says Clean Sky.

Airbus hopes to confirm a 50% lowering in wing-friction drag, which will translate into “up to 5% block-fuel and CO2 emission reduction” if the technology is applied to short-range aircraft flying up to 800 nautical miles.

The new NLF wing sections are close in size and configuration to a possible future wing for a short-range, single-aisle airliner, says Airbus. Initial thoughts had envisaged a complete wing for testing on a smaller aircraft, but BLADE project leader Daniel Kierbel explains that using a smaller proportion of a larger wing reduces the potential for loss of control while exploring the limit of laminar flow.

Rapid recent development of numerical flow-simulation tools has enabled the aerospace industry to design, build, demonstrate and validate an optimized NLF wing, according to Airbus, which has defined (and validated through ground testing) “aerodynamic flight-control laws related to the specific shape of the natural laminar wing”.

The BLADE project intends to test the robustness and sustainability of natural laminarity in operational service so that – by specifying production-tolerance requirements – manufacturers can properly specify and design laminar components (including wings) for future commercial aircraft.

The program’s primary aim is to accelerate future industrialization (or mass production) of laminar wings, for which previous technology has been insufficiently mature for commercial aviation application and has not been fully validated in flight. “The past 50 years have seen more than 70% improvement in relative fuel-burn per seat and 90% in noise emissions, but a practical application of laminar flow has not been achieved,” says Flaig.

Pointing out that natural (or passive) laminarity can be achieved through aerofoil shape while hybrid (active or passive) laminar flow can be generated with, say, boundary layer suction, Kierbel outlines the many factors that influence the presence of NLF on an industrial wing.

First come external considerations outside the wing. These include leading-edge and wing contamination (such as de-icing fluids, dents, dust, erosion, grease, insects and scratches); atmospheric disturbances; and acoustic disturbances and vibrations.

Secondary (or internal) factors can comprise such considerations as system integration, deformation of fastener heads and joints, gap-filler material, and local and global wing deformation.

Split decision

The A340BLADE combines a transonic laminar wing profile with a true internal primary structure



A340-300 MSN001 is being used because it is available and has a natural wing split that permitted replacement of the outer sections. The biggest external change following modification is the introduction of the two representative transonic laminar outer-wing sections.

Clean Sky says that experiments to better understand and control the laminar-to-turbulent flow transition, which is influenced by (for example) isolated surface gaps, steps and holes, prepared the groundwork for full-scale wing design and flight testing – “the first time such realistic test data has been available for future aircraft design”.

The 8m-span (26ft) NLF sections were designed and manufactured with partners Saab of Sweden and GKN UK for two different solutions, each complying with stringent accuracy, stability and tolerance requirements to maintain laminarity in all flight regimes.

Kierbel says that NLF wing architectures involve two options – one with a one-piece carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) wingskin and leading edge (supported by integrated wing-rib feet and spar cap) on Saab’s port outer wing, and the other with a mechanically fastened CFRP wingskin and metallic leading edge, interrupted by a joint at the forward spar, on GKN’s starboard outer wing.

Airbus had to design a wingbox to interface the existing wing with the NLF sections, which are very evident because they feature a 20° sweepback (about 10° less than that of the original unit). Inside the aircraft, a specialist FTI station has been installed.

Kierbel says that replacement of the outer wings and modification of the A340 tailfin to accommodate a camera pod (to confirm wing behavior) involved “a combination of experience and a technology bridge”. Overall, the Tarbes engineering work involved “21 European partners, 500 contributors and 6,500 parts”.

Major steps in developing the A340BLADE demonstrator included the manufacture of several special components, according to Clean Sky: large aero-fairings to separate the new outboard NLF wing sections from the original turbulent inboard wing; wingtip pods to ensure a defined flow pattern at the outboard end of each NLF section and to contain flight test equipment (with optical access close to the laminar wing), with a diffusion zone passing wing loads and torque from the NLF section to the datum wing structure; and a digital mock-up of the NLF wing outboard of the datum wing’s number-one (port outer) engine.

Wind-tunnel tests (see Tunnel vision, p25) were conducted to check low-speed performance and to test a Krueger leading-edge anti-contamination device used to influence airflow over about 20% of the new NLF section span. Flight testing is “intended to demonstrate the device’s potential to shield the upper wing surface from contamination”, according to Kierbel.

He points out that laminar flow is “much better at lower speed, but requires transonic airflow”. As well as containing infrared cameras, the tailfin pod provides mounting for an altitude/airspeed-calibration trailing cone and two cone-flow cameras.

FTI was a challenging and innovative aspect of the BLADE project, according to Airbus. In addition to standard inflight measurements of acceleration, pressure and temperature, the program partners needed to measure: laminar-flow transition location on the wing (using surface-mounted heat-sensitive film and infrared cameras); NLF wing-surface quality and deformation (reflectometry); NLF wing-shape in flight (with loads and inertial sensing); and NLF wing deformation (via an internal mechanical sensor).

To this end (and using such testing on an aircraft for the first time), Airbus says there are “hundreds of points to measure the waviness of the wing surface” to help ascertain its influence on airflow laminarity. “Airbus will simulate every type of surface imperfection in a controlled manner, so that the tolerances for building a laminar wing will be fully known.”

The manufacturer says the project also represents the first use of pod-mounted infrared cameras to measure wing temperature and of an acoustic generator to measure the influence of acoustics on laminarity. The wingtip reflectometry system that gauges overall inflight deformation in real time is also said to be innovative. As viewed through transparent apertures, the latter record reflections on the upper wingskin of a diagonal-striped pattern on the wingpod where the NLF outer wing is attached, concludes Kierbel.

Tunnel vision

A critical step in the flight-clearance process for the BLADE demonstrator aircraft – Airbus A340-300 MSN001 – was wind-tunnel measurements in the German-Dutch Wind-Tunnels large low-speed facility (DNW-LLF) in Marknesse, the Netherlands, in early 2014. Low-speed aerodynamic tests were carried out on a 1:10.6-scale model in the tunnel’s closed 8 x 6m (26 x 20ft) test section to represent the flying demonstrator under atmospheric conditions.

Having gathered data for the standard A340, a main objective was to check the effect of an installed natural laminar-flow (NLF) outer-wing panel. Other goals included: studying ground effect, downwash and handling qualities (effect on longitudinal and lateral control and stability from the use of ailerons, flaps, spoilers and rudder); examining wing airflow and stall behavior to obtain information on boundary-layer transition (using infrared thermography); and using optical techniques to measure deformation to establish local attitude changes due to wing torsion.

Anticipating the technology now being employed on the real aircraft, the testing used infrared thermography to locate the boundary-layer transition point on the NLF panel. The exercise also yielded valuable knowledge on the use of techniques such as stereo-pattern recognition for deformation measurements in such wind-tunnel applications.

Blade runner

Airbus leads the BLADE program and with Saab co-leads the SFWA-ITD, which is funded by the EU Horizon 2020 program. SFWA-ITD addresses integration of passive and active flow, and load-control technologies for large aircraft and business jets, aiming to demonstrate that innovative capabilities, concepts and technologies can contribute to a step-change in reduced fuel consumption and noise.

Ultimately the SWFA project will use on-ground or inflight demonstration vehicles aimed at reducing aircraft drag by 10% by lowering wing drag using laminarity, cutting aircraft fuel burn by 20% by integrating advanced engines, and reducing aircraft noise by up to 10dB by engine noise shielding configurations.

Airbus led the structural and fuel, hydraulic and electrical system modifications, which involved 21 design, manufacturing, research and testing partners. It emphasizes that the A340-300 BLADE exercise – “the largest flight test demonstrator ever launched in Europe” – has “no link to any possible future aircraft program”, although “maturity of this technology could possibly be considered for a future aircraft program.”

Flight lab log

The A340-300 BLADE demonstrator campaign, which originated in 2008, is part of a broader program using several aircraft to test new technologies in Airbus Research & Technology’s Flight Lab department. A dedicated hangar was erected at Tarbes in southern France to house the A340-300 (and other Flight Lab projects) during its conversion.

Started in 2008, the following steps have been successfully accomplished by the BLADE team.

Flexing its muscles: the A400M Atlas is proven in service as Germany's 15th aircraft is delivered - Airbus,"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE4LTAxLWZsZXhpbmctaXRzLW11c2NsZXMtdGhlLWE0MDBtLWF0bGFzLWlzLXByb3Zlbi1pbi1zZXJ2aWNlLWFzLWdlcm1hbnlzLTE1dGjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Versatility, range and payload lift demonstrated in varied missions

With 58 A400M multi-role military transporters delivered to date by Airbus – including last friday’s handover of the German Air Force’s 16th from 53 on order – the workhorse aircraft is receiving high marks for its payload carrying capability, operational versatility, flight range and the ability to operate from short airfields.

The A400M is living up to the ‘Atlas’ nickname, having performed heavy-lift duties during missions ranging from supporting troops in counter-terrorism deployments to the delivery of humanitarian goods and airlifting relief supplies into disaster areas.

It has become favourite for pilots based on the airlifter’s crisp and precise handling thanks to Airbus’ proven fly-by-wire system, the excellent situational awareness with advanced head-up display, and powerful brakes for tight landing situations.

A large cargo hold, and “kneeling” capability for loading/unloading

Loadmasters – who are tasked with the safe loading, transportation and unloading of cargo – are united in their appreciation of the A400M’s large cargo hold with integral winch, the automatic load-locking system, and the aircraft’s “kneeling” ability that eases loading/unloading and reduces the rear ramp angle.

The French Air Force, which became the initial A400M Atlas operator in 2013, has received 13 of its 50 airlifters on order – regularly dispatching the aircraft with troops and equipment for two major French counter-terrorism deployments: Operation Chammal in the Middle East and Operation Barkhane in Africa. ""With the A400M’s four powerful turboprop engines, we can carry enormous loads at incredible speed, enabling us to rapidly respond to crisis situations all over the world,” explained Captain Ronan, a pilot in the 1/61 Touraine squadron, a unit belonging to the French Air Force’s 61st Transport Wing. French Air Force A400M also assisted in rescue efforts in the islands affected by Hurricane Irma.

A400M French Air Force at Hurricane Irma

For the UK Royal Air Force, its first A400M operational tasking was to deliver much needed food, water and essential aid to UK Dependencies and other Caribbean islands in Operation Ruman after the region’s devastating hurricanes in 2017. Operation Ruman successfully utilised two aircraft for the Caribbean humanitarian flights in delivering tonnes of aid – providing significantly more payload per mission than smaller C-130 transporters that the A400M is replacing.

“Remarkable” A400M performance in Caribbean relief flights

“The A400M was remarkable in what it could do,” said Wing Commander Burdett of the RAF’s No. 24 Squadron. “It could take three times as much as a C-130 into a tight, small strip without taking any military risk in its performance. Whereas the C-130 was taking in five tonnes, the A400 would be taking in 15.”

Having received 18 A400Ms from the total 22 on order, other RAF operations performed by the Atlas are regular transport flights to the Mediterranean island of Cyprus in support of Operation Shader (the UK’s military intervention in Iraq and Syria), and the detachment of an aircraft to the Middle East in the backing of UK forces around the Arabian Gulf.

Additionally, Royal Air Force missions to Ascension Island in the South Atlantic Ocean have benefitted from the Atlas’ landing gear with 12 main wheels that distribute the A400M’s overall weight while on the ground. This makes the aircraft ‘light on its feet’ – invaluable for hauling heavy payloads while not causing runway damage, after concerns were raised about the island airfield’s landing surface condition."
Airbus accuses Leonardo of playing dirty - Defense News,"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9sYW5kLzIwMTgvMDEvMzAvYWlyYnVzLWFjY3VzZXMtbGVvbmFyZG8tb2YtcGxheWluZy1kaXJ0eS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — It’s Groundhog Day in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, where Leonardo has filed another lawsuit against the U.S. Army as the service moves to buy more Lakota helicopters from Airbus for its training fleet.

If this sounds familiar, it is. AgustaWestland, a Leonardo subsidiary, filed a lawsuit two years ago in the same court over a standard sources sought notice the Army issued seeking those capable of building a lot of 16 LUH-72A Lakota helicopters for the same fleet. The court ruled in favor of AgustaWestland but the U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the lower court’s decision last week.

And while the upper court decided in favor of the Army’s appeal Jan. 24, and the court system gave Leonardo ample time to withdraw its lawsuit filed Jan. 22, the company decided to keep its lawsuit active on Jan. 26, Chris Emerson, president of Airbus Helicopters, told a group of reporters in a call Jan. 30.

And Airbus isn’t taking Leonardo’s manuevers sitting down this time.

Emerson opened the call to reporters stating that he’s “never done a press call like this before,” but said, “we have never in our history faced a situation like this before.”

“The DoD acquisition system, with its own set of challenges is under attack by a company that seems to think it has nothing to lose and if they succeed, it will constitute a credible threat to every major player in the U.S. defense industry,” he said.

The background

The dispute rose out of an Army decision, stemming from major budget cuts under sequestration, to restructure its aviation assets. In 2013 the service came up with the Aviation Restructure Initiative (ARI) that retired the OH-58 Kiowa Warrior helicopter and the Army’s TH-67 single-engine basic rotary wing training helicopter. As part of the ARI, the Army decided to take dual-engine Lakotas already in the inventory and repurpose them as the new designated trainer.

That meant the pool of possible services looking to buy new training helicopters had shrunk for competitors like AgustaWestland and Bell Helicopter.

AgustaWestland sued the Army in September 2014, filing a premature complaint over a standard sources-sought notice the Army issued seeking those capable of building Lakota helicopters in preparation to buy more of the aircraft for the training fleet.

The court paused the case until the Army filed a justification and approval document that explained why the service must sole-source the helicopter buy to Airbus.

AgustaWestland then filed a supplemental complaint over the 16 Lakotas that the Army was unable to purchase under its original contract with the Army. The service would have had to procure them under a follow-on contract. The company argued the decision to sole-source those helicopters was unjustified and restricted competition.

The judge in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled the Army had to conduct a competition, reissue a justification and approval document addressing deficiencies identified by the court, or not proceed with procurement.

After waiting a painful two years, the Army decided Jan. 4 to proceed with buying 35 Lakota helicopters using fiscal year 2017 funding, issuing a sources sought notice to industry. While the appeals court had yet to make a ruling, the lawsuit only addressed the previous lot of 16 Lakota helicopters that would have been purchased using FY16 funding, so it could be interpreted that the injunction did not apply to other procurement years.

[Even after being sued, Army moves to buy more Lakota helos]



Dangerous precedent

Emerson said he believed AgustaWestland’s new lawsuit uses the same legal arguments and reasoning as the previous case, now for the new buy using FY17 funding. “The appellate ruling makes it clear that they can have no possible chance of winning it, so why pursue the lawsuit? I’m sorry to say this, but there is only one possible explanation.”

“If they had won the lawsuit, they would have just prevented the Army from meeting its readiness needs, but it would not have forced the Army to have procured Leonardo products,” Emerson said.

“It can’t be to help their chances with other DoD program that they are attempting to pursue like the Navy trainer helicopter or the Air Force’s trainer aircraft. In fact, this can only possibly hurt them in those pursuits, showing the Navy and Air Force what they can expect from Leonardo, when it comes out, to how they treat a customer,” he said.

Step one in figuring out the rationale for the new lawsuit is dissecting the harm done by the first. The previous lawsuit prevented the Army from meeting its readiness goals within the basic rotary-wing training school at Fort Rucker, Alabama. The Army used a mix of Lakotas it could transfer from elsewhere in the service but could not complete the training fleet without buying additional Lakotas in a follow-on contract from Airbus.

The U.S. Army made a decision to retire its TH-67 training helicopters and instead use LUH-72A Lakota helicopters already in the service's inventory. But it's struggled to buy them due to a lawsuit filed over two years ago by Leonardo over procurement of the helicopters for the training fleet (Photo by Sgt. Michael Adams/U.S. Army National Guard)

And the lawsuit caused uncertainty for the future of Airbus’ production line in Columbus, Mississippi, leaving employees wondering if they would have a job in 2018 as the final Lakota on order rolls off the production line on Feb. 28.

“The only reason we can see for this lawsuit is to do what they nearly succeeded in doing with the last lawsuit, tie up Army acquisition in the court system for years, preventing the next Lakota contract long enough to strangle our U.S. production line and put our American workers out of a job,” Emerson said. “Why? If they can succeed in forcing us to issue the last pink slip on the Lakota line, they have just eliminated another competitor for the next half decade.”

Emerson continued: “If they can successfully exploit the legal system to tie up contracts and military requirements, they can do it to anyone. They can do it to Boeing, Lockheed, Bell, Raytheon, Northrop, General Dynamics and the list goes on and on. Every one of those companies is awarded follow-on, sole-source contracts,” just like the one Leonardo is going after now.

Leonardo declined to comment on the current or past lawsuits or on statements made by Airbus Helicopter’s president.



The fear, Emerson conveyed, lies within the implication Leonardo’s actions in court could have on procurement for any major weapon system.

Additionally, if Leonardo is successful in court, it could trigger a new trend to completely circumvent the short 90-day Government Accountability Office protest process and tie up disputes for much longer, according to Emerson.

Emerson questioned: “Can the Air Force afford to wait two or three years before it moves forward with the contract on T-X, can the Navy afford two years in court if it doesn’t choose a Leonardo product for its Navy trainer? And if Leonardo succeeds, why can’t someone else?”

Leonardo’s current modus operandi is “not the way to be a responsible member of the U.S. defense industrial base,” Emerson added. “We do business with good products at a fair price, not with legal arm twisting. You say you want competition, then compete according to the same rules that the rest of us play by here in the U.S.”

Direct impact

Now Airbus is facing the same fears it faced in December: what will happen to its production line if the Army isn’t able to finalize a contract to produce the 16 Lakotas it’s now allowed to build by February’s end?

And now that another lawsuit is pending in court, the Army can’t proceed to buy the 35 Lakotas it has planned to purchase when it issued a sources sought notice earlier this month.

Emerson said he does not know when the Army will be able go get under contract for the Lakotas it can build and it’s possible the court, with its full docket, won’t be able to decide whether to take up the case until around mid-April.

Airbus opted, with a certain level of risk, to keep its supply base hot last year, pre-ordering components and assembling those in anticipation of being able to proceed with more Lakota builds in 2018.

“We just need to run it through the final assembly line so the sooner we can get confirmation that we can start producing the follow-on contract the sooner it takes away the uncertainty from our employment base,” Emerson said.

Airbus delivers record 718 aircraft amid strong sales - Leeham News and Analysis,"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxOC8wMS8xNS9haXJidXMtZGVsaXZlcnMtcmVjb3JkLTcxOC1haXJjcmFmdC1hbWlkLXN0cm9uZy1zYWxlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Bjorn Fehrm

January 15, 2018, ©. Leeham Co: Airbus announced record 2017 airliner deliveries of 718 aircraft today. It was the 15th consecutive year of increased production, this time with 30 aircraft over 2016. Fabrice Bregier, the Chief Operating Officer of Airbus, predicted Airbus would pass Boeing in deliveries by 2020.

The company also booked its third best year in orders, with 1,109 aircraft giving a Book-to-Bill of 1.5. The backlog is at a record 7,256 aircraft (Figure 1).

Airbus’s better than expected year

The market had Airbus just passing 700 delivered aircraft for 2017, with over 1,000 sales. The delivery of 718 aircraft was, therefore, an overachievement compared with expectations, as was net orders of 1,109 aircraft.

The driver for both numbers is the A320 series, with 588 total deliveries whereof 181 A320neo compared with a plan of 200. The shortfall could be compensated with deliveries of 377 A320ceo. Net orders for the type was a record 1054.

Historically, Airbus was leading the delivery race while Boeing ramped the 787 programs, Figure 2.

Once the 787 got running, Boeing’s combined single-aisle and widebody deliveries have left Airbus behind for the last five years. Bregier predicted this will change by 2020 when Airbus has ramped the A350 to 10 deliveries per month.

Orders have outpaced Boeing for nine of the last 10 years, Figure 3. Once again the A320 program makes the difference, with Airbus winning 53% of all orders during the period.

John Leahy, Airbus COO Customers, said Airbus’ single-aisle A320 has outsold Boeing’s 737 with 54% of total orders during this period, Figure 4.

Leahy rejected the notion Boeing has outsold Airbus on the widebody side. He said widebody sales go up and down over the years. Taken over the last 10 years, the widebody orders have been even, with Airbus outselling Boeing seven of the 10 years, Figure 5.

A320

Deliveries of 558 A320 have been possible, despite a shortage of engines for the A320neo. About 30 of the 60 parked A320neo “gliders” from 2016 could be equipped with engines and delivered. A321ceo and neo deliveries were 35% of the total A320 deliveries during 2017.

For 2018 Bregier predicted A320neos would be two-thirds of over 600 A320 deliveries. He gave the precaution, there must be no continued shortage of engines for this to happen.

A330

Last year was a transition year for A330, with the ceo version delivering 67 aircraft. The neo version starting flight test in October, about six months later than planned. Certification and first delivery to TAP Portugal of the A330-900 is planned for summer 2018.

A350

Airbus delivered 78 A350-900 which was about halfway to an expected 100 deliveries for 2018 (from 49 for 2016). Production rate shall have reached 10/month by end 2018. The A350-1000 was certified in December, but as expected the foreseen 2017 delivery of the first aircraft to Qatar Airways was pushed into 2018.

A380

Leahy and Bregier delivered a strong message to Emirates in the press conference. If there would be no new Emirates orders keeping the production rate over a minimum of six per year until 2030, Airbus would stop the program. From 2030 Airbus expect an expanding passenger market would need the A380.

Deliveries for 2017 was 15, with 12 planned for 2018 and eight for 2019.

“From 2020 it would be possible to keep the program running with an acceptable industrial result at a minimum rate of six aircraft per year,” said Bregier. “The orders for these aircraft would have to come from Emirates, as other airline orders would be marginal,” Breigier warned about giving cooperation talks with China around A380 too much weight.

"Naval Group, Airbus collaborate on helicopter drone project - Defense News","Thu, 11 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS8yMDE4LzAxLzExL25hdmFsLWdyb3VwLWFpcmJ1cy1jb2xsYWJvcmF0ZS1vbi1oZWxpY29wdGVyLWRyb25lLXByb2plY3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS ― Naval Group and Airbus Helicopters are to launch a technology study for a helicopter drone for the French Navy’s heavily armed ships.

“The Direction Générale de l’Armement (DGA) signed Dec. 29, 2017, a contract with Naval Group and Airbus Helicopters for a study which prepares for the future capability of tactical drones with a vertical take-off from French Navy ships (the Navy Airborne Drone System),” the DGA procurement office said Jan. 11 in a statement.

A DGA spokesman declined to provide the contract’s value.

The target is to have a demonstrator with mature technology by mid-2021, DGA said. The demonstrator program includes flights from a frigate.

Naval Group and Airbus Helicopters will work with Hélicoptères Guimbal, a small to medium-sized company that builds the two-seat Cabri G2 light helicopter, the DGA said.

Thales as well as Safran Electronics & Defense will also work on the project, drawing on technology and capabilities on fixed-wing drones acquired through research requested by the procurement office since 2005, the DGA said. Other small and medium companies, mostly French, will be involved.

“The contract covers de-risking studies ahead of construction of a future tactical helicopter drone demonstrator aboard warships,” Naval Group and Airbus Helicopters said in a joint statement. The project aims to conduct trials of the airborne vehicle, launch and mission systems, working on a French Navy vessel. Onera, the aerospace research office, is one of the main subcontractors.

Naval Group and Airbus Helicopters will act as the program design authority, the two companies said.



The naval UAV is expected to enter service around 2025 on the FTI intermediate frigate and other French Navy warships.

Airbus Helicopters has developed its VSR700 naval drone based on the Cabri G2, while Naval Group has worked on integrating that unmanned helicopter onto warship systems."

Launched a decade ago, the A380 program has cost billions, but only 220 have been built.

Having received no new orders for the world's largest passenger airline for the past two years, Airbus admitted on Monday it might have to end production of the A380 double-decker jet.

""If we can't work out a deal with Emirates, there is no choice but to shut down the program,"" the European aerospace group's chief salesman John Leahy told reporters in Paris.

Airbus had been banking on additional orders of the superjumbo from the Dubai-based airline last November to complement its 100-strong A380 fleet, but instead Emirates sealed a deal to buy 40 Boeing Dreamliners.

Talks ongoing

The plane maker is still talking to Emirates about buying more than 30 more of the A380 in order to secure future production.

Leahy said Emirates is ""the only one who has the ability"" to commit to a minimum of six planes a year for a minimum of eight to 10 years, which Airbus needs to make the program viable.

Airbus's decision in 2007 to pursue the 853-seat A380 was diametrically opposed to Boeing's bet on the Dreamliner, marketed as a more efficient plane that could be used for both medium and long-distance flights.

Despite Airbus's insistence that larger planes costing 535 million euros ($437 million) were the best way to tackle higher oil prices and environmental concerns, the A380's order book has always been lacking.

Just 15 of the planes were delivered last year, with 12 more set for dispatch in 2018. The last order, for three jets, was made in January 2016 by Japan's ANA, and that was the first after nearly three years.

Despite marking its 10th year in the skies last year, orders for the A380 have fallen dramatically as airlines struggled to make profits Image: Airbus

Airlines have complained that they have to fly every flight at full capacity in order to make a profit.

Humiliating for Europe

Abandoning the superjumbo would be a disappointing defeat for the Toulouse, France-based firm, which spent many years and many billions developing the behemoth, while forcing airports to build longer runways to allow it to land.

Airbus said the A380 program could continue with just six planes built each year, and hoped that China could in future lead a revival in orders once demand for long-haul planes picks up.

Monday's announcement dwarfed news that Airbus had sold 1,109 planes last year, compared with its rival Boeing's 912 jets.

But Boeing delivered 763 planes compared with 718 for Airbus in the same period.

Looking ahead, Airbus Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier said deliveries for 2018 could rise to 800, given the increased pace of production for the A320neo — Airbus's response to the Dreamliner.

Madrid, 23 January 2018 – Airbus Defence and Space has delivered to the Spanish Air Force the first two Eurofighter Typhoons to be produced in the latest configuration with enhanced air-to-surface capabilities.

The aircraft were manufactured at the Getafe Final Assembly Line in the P1Eb FW (Phase 1 Enhanced Further Work) configuration which marks a key step in the overall Eurofighter evolution plan.

This same configuration is being retrofitted to in-service aircraft by other Eurofighter nations. It provides increased integration of a variety of air-to-surface weapons and enhanced targeting among other improvements.

Spanish procurement agency DGAM took delivery of the aircraft on 22 December and they were subsequently ferried to Albacete air force base to enter service. The remaining six of the 73 aircraft currently contracted by Spain will be delivered to the same P1Eb FW standard during 2018 and 2019.

Airbus Operating Officer, Military Aircraft, Alberto Gutierrez said: “The smooth introduction of these enhanced features is a vital element of Eurofighter’s evolution. It is a big tribute to the Airbus and Spanish customer teams that they achieved this on-time through effective collaboration and clearly demonstrates the rich manufacturing capability here at Getafe.”

DGAM Head of Aeronautical Systems Gen Léon Antonio Machés said: “The entry into service of these aircraft is the outcome of strong collaborative activity between our personnel and those of Airbus. It is an excellent illustration of the technical expertise that will support many more years of Eurofighter industrial activity in Spain.”

Airbus goes on the offense as Lakota helicopter battle continues - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWdvZXMtb2ZmZW5zZS1sYWtvdGEtaGVsaWNvcHRlci1iYXR0bGUtY29udGludWVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Last week, it appeared that a three-year legal saga had come to an end when a federal appeals court cleared the U.S. Army to purchase 16 Airbus UH-72A Lakota helicopters — an acquisition that had been authorized for fiscal year 2016, but delayed by legal challenges from Leonardo Helicopters.

The legal saga has not come to an end.

In a conference call on Tuesday, Airbus Helicopters, Inc. president Chris Emerson informed reporters that despite the Jan. 23 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, Leonardo has chosen to pursue yet another lawsuit in the Court of Federal Claims, contesting Army plans to acquire Lakotas using fiscal year 2017 funding.

Leonardo’s actions could imperil the future of the Lakota production line in Columbus, Mississippi, which Emerson said is currently scheduled to deliver its last aircraft on Feb. 28.

And in his conference call with reporters, Emerson sought to cast Leonardo as a contractor that refused to play by established rules, threatening to upset not only Airbus, but the entire U.S. defense procurement system in the process.

“The implications of the present situation reach well beyond Airbus to affect all of our peers and competitors who hold current, and future, U.S. defense contracts,” Emerson said.

“The DoD [Department of Defense] acquisition system, with its own set of challenges, is under attack by a company that seems to think it has nothing to lose. And if they succeed it will constitute a credible threat to every major player in the U.S. defense industry.”

The dispute between Leonardo on one side, and the Army and Airbus on the other, traces its roots to the 2013 Army Aviation Restructure Initiative (ARI), which among other things called for replacing the Army’s aging Bell TH-67 primary training helicopters with UH-72A Lakotas.

The Army initially envisioned using existing aircraft for this purpose, but ultimately determined that it would need to acquire another 110 Lakota helicopters. When Leonardo challenged a sources sought notice that the declared the Army’s intention to purchase 155 Lakotas on an “other than full and competitive basis,” the Army instead exercised options on its existing Lakota contracts, leaving it just 16 helicopters short of its requirement.

In December 2015, the Army issued a Justification & Approval (J&A) to sole source these 16 Lakotas from Airbus. Leonardo didn’t back down, and in August 2016, a Court of Federal Claims judge sided with Leonardo, finding that the Army’s declaration of the Lakota as its “institutional training helicopter” was essentially a procurement decision that violated the Competition in Contracting Act.

This is the ruling that was overturned last week by the Federal Circuit, which found that the trial court judge had exceeded her jurisdictional authority in questioning an Army policy decision. The Federal Circuit also found the Army’s J&A to be “coherent and reasonable,” and vacated the trial court’s preliminary injunction against the 16-aircraft acquisition.

“In short, the case was without merit,” Emerson said in his Tuesday conference call. He blasted Leonardo for pursuing its case through the courts, rather than through the established system for protesting defense contract awards with the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

“There is a system that we have all followed for decades, until now,” he said. “That system exists primarily for the benefit of the warfighter, and the taxpayer, but also for the benefit of our industry and the thousands it employs. It’s called the GAO protest process.”

Addressing Leonardo’s latest lawsuit, Emerson said, “The only reason we can see for this lawsuit is to do what they nearly succeeded in doing with the last lawsuit: tie up Army acquisition in the court system for years, preventing the next Lakota contract long enough to strangle our U.S. production line and put our American workers out of a job.

“Why? If they can succeed in forcing us to issue the last pink slip on the Lakota line, they have just eliminated another competitor for the next half decade.”

Emerson cast Leonardo’s actions as ominous not only for Airbus and the Army, but also for other defense contractors and military branches.

“If they can successfully exploit the legal system to tie up contracts and military requirements, they can do it to anyone. They can do it to Boeing, Lockheed, Bell, Raytheon, Northrop, General Dynamics, and the list goes on and on,” he said.

“And to the rest of the Defense Department, please take note: this is an Army problem today, but it may very well be an Air Force problem next, and then a Navy problem afterwards,” Emerson added, mentioning upcoming procurements for which Leonardo is expected to compete.

Concluding prepared remarks, Emerson said, “Our message to Leonardo is simply this: this is not the way to be a responsible member of the U.S. defense industrial base. This is not the way to treat any customer, let alone the military that defends us, or the American taxpayers who fund them. . . .

“We do business with good products at a fair price, not with legal arm twisting. You say you want competition, then compete according to the same rules that the rest of us play by here in the U.S.”

On the same day as Emerson’s conference call, Leonardo Helicopters’ Italian parent company rolled out its 2018-2022 industrial plan, part of which aims to restore double-digit profitability to the company’s helicopter business by 2020.

A Leonardo spokesperson told Vertical that, due to the company’s focus on the rollout of the industrial plan, it did not have comment on Emerson’s remarks. Leonardo previously declined to comment on the Federal Circuit’s Jan. 23 ruling, and on the Army’s Jan. 4 sources sought notice that is the subject of its latest lawsuit."
Airbus fires laser-guided rockets from H145M helicopter - Defense News,"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS90ZWNod2F0Y2gvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS9haXJidXMtZmlyZXMtbGFzZXItZ3VpZGVkLXJvY2tldHMtZnJvbS1oMTQ1bS1oZWxpY29wdGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Airbus Helicopters has announced a successful test-firing campaign of 70mm laser-guided rockets from its H145M helicopter.

The rocket tests, which were conducted in early December but announced Jan. 31, are part of the company’s development of its HForce weapons packages meant for military services looking to arm rotorcraft.

The tests were conducted at the Alvaden test range in Sweden, with the Thales FZ275 LGR, which stands for laser-guided rocket, and an MX-15D electro-optical system from L3 Wescam, according to Airbus.

The rockets are intended to deliver a precision strike, which seeks to limit civilians casualties, particularly in asymmetric combat.

The tests followed ballistic firing tests in Hungary in October, another key step in the development of the HForce weapon system for the H145M military helicopter.

Qualification of the ballistic HForce weapons package is expected at end of this year, with laser-guided rockets due to be certified by the end of 2019, the company said. The ballistic weapons include a 20mm cannon and a 12.7mm machine gun."

Faury to leave Airbus Helicopters in 'stable' market environment - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 23 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvZmF1cnktbGVhdmUtYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLXN0YWJsZS1tYXJrZXQtZW52aXJvbm1lbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters CEO Guillaume Faury, who is to become Airbus Commercial Aircraft’s president next month, is leaving the company as rotorcraft sales are anticipated to remain stable this year.

“Around 400 deliveries would be a good objective for 2018,” he said yesterday during a conference call. Last year, Airbus Helicopters delivered 409 helicopters, almost the same number as in 2016 (418). Of 2017’s deliveries, 260 units were for the civil and parapublic sectors. For rotary-wing aircraft with six seats or more, Airbus claims to have a 50 percent market share of civil and parapublic deliveries.

Gross orders stood at 350 (net orders were slightly lower, at 335), meaning Faury’s January 2017 prediction for the year ahead proved accurate both for orders and deliveries.

“I am very satisfied with the order mix, with a strong performance of heavies and super mediums,” Faury said. The Super Puma family, despite a nonexistent oil-and-gas market for heavy helicopters, had “one of its biggest years ever” thanks to military and parapublic sales. The 54 orders included 45 H225s and 10 H215s.

The super-medium H175 “remains our joker in the changing oil-and-gas environment,” Faury said, and garnered 19 orders.

In medium helicopters, “this year will be the year of the first commercial contract for the H160,” Faury said. The program, which Airbus hopes will restore its “40 percent market share” on the segment, has so far lacked clear, solid numbers illustrating customer interest.

At the end of 2017, the company’s overall backlog stood at 692 helicopters. While the level of orders and deliveries is low, Faury described the environment last year as “stable.” He said the level of deliveries was “a testimony of our resilience.”

In the emerging “air mobility” segment, 2018 will be the year of the first flight of the CityAirbus demonstrator. The electric four-seater, which features four pairs of propellers for vertical flight, is being developed at Airbus Helicopters’ site in Donauwörth, Germany.

The Racer, a compound helicopter demonstrator being built as a follow-on to the X3, is on schedule for a first flight in 2020, according to Faury.

He said he would urge his successor to “keep going on air mobility.” The new CEO, whose name is expected to be announced in the coming days, should also “explore new markets,” said Faury. He added that he or she should address key technology enablers — “autonomous flight, new architectures and electrification.”

In Faury’s view, the next CEO should also proceed with digitalization, already well under way on production lines and in services. Described as a “key pillar for the next five years,”, digitalization is expected to bring new services to customers and the company itself. It will improve fleet availability, Faury said. “The H125 and H130 light singles have a digital future and you will hear more details at Heli-Expo,” he added."

Prospective Airbus and Boeing customers should expect to pay a bit more for their new aircraft. The world's two major aircraft manufacturers both announced this month that they've increased list prices for 2018.

In a press release, Airbus announced that its list prices have increased across its product line by 2%. On the other hand, Boeing quietly increased its list prices by 4.1% for its commercial airplanes — 2.1% more than its counterpart. Unlike Airbus, Boeing didn't publicly announce the increase in a press release.

Here's a look at the price comparisons for comparable products from both Airbus and Boeing:

Product (Boeing vs. Airbus) 2018 Airbus Price 2018 Boeing Price 737-700 vs. A319 $92.3 million $85.8 million 737-800 vs. A320 $101 million $102.2 million 737-900ER vs. A321 $118.3 million $108.4 million 737 MAX 7 vs. A319neo $101.5 million $96 million 737 MAX 8 vs. A320neo $110.6 million $117.1 million 737 MAX 9 vs. A321neo $129.5 million $124.1 million 767-300ER vs. A330-200 $238.5 million $209.8 million 787-8 vs. A350-800 $280.6 million $239 million 787-9 vs. A350-900 $317.4 million $281.6 million 787-10 vs. A350-1000 $366.5 million $325.8 million 747-8 vs. A380-800 $445.6 million $402.9 million

Note that while the list price for each of the aircraft types is listed above, customers often receive discounts for placing orders in bulk. In addition, there are several other aircraft not listed in the above chart — check the individual list pricing for both Boeing and Airbus on their respective sites. There are some chin scratchers, too — for example, Boeing raised the price on its 767-300ER, but it hasn't produced one of the aircraft in several years.

Historically, changes to list prices aren't uncommon. However, Boeing's 2018 increase is more dramatic compared to years past. In both 2015 and 2016, Boeing kept its list prices unchanged, but in 2017, it raised its list prices 2% across the board."

PARIS – Airbus said Monday it will stop making the costly A380 superjumbo jet if the European multinational corporation doesn't land a long-term deal with the Emirates airline for a steady supply of the planes.

Abandoning the A380 would be a disappointing defeat for Airbus, which spent many years and many billions developing the double-decker behemoth, even as skeptics questioned the whether the jet would generate enough demand to justify its cost and the bigger runways it requires.

""If we can't work out a deal with Emirates, there is no choice but to shut down the program,"" Airbus chief salesman John Leahy told news reporters in Paris.

Leahy said the Dubai-based, government-owned airline is “the only one who has the ability” to commit to a minimum of six planes a year for a minimum of eight to 10 years, the production timetable Airbus needs to make the program viable.

Emirates declined to issue an immediate comment.

Airbus discussion of the potential cancellation came as the Airbus said net orders for all of the company's aircraft rose 52% to 1,109 in 2017. The total topped the 912 commercial plane orders reported by U.S. aerospace giant Boeing and made Airbus the winner in the rivals' annual order contest for a fifth consecutive year.

The A380 drew worldwide attention when launched a decade ago but has always struggled to win enough customers. Airbus delivered just 15 of the planes last year, and aims to deliver 12 more this year and could scale down production to six per year after that, CEO Fabrice Bregier said.

Emirates now relies solely on the Airbus 380 and the Boeing 777 for its flights, making it the largest operator of both. It has over 160 Boeing 777s in its fleet today and took possession of its 100th A380 in November.

Reports circulated before the Dubai Air Show in November that a major A380 sale would be coming.

Instead, Airbus employees found themselves attending a news conference at which Emirates announced the purchase of 40 Boeing 787-10 Dreamliners in a $15.1 billion deal. The air show ended without an A380 deal, throwing the line's future into question.

Airbus, based in Toulouse, France, reported Monday that it delivered 718 planes in 2017, fewer than Boeing’s 763 but still a record for Airbus.

Bregier said Airbus will speed up production in the coming year, notably of its long-delayed widebody A350, and hopes to out-deliver Boeing by 2020.

Bregier, who’s being replaced next month by Guillaume Faury as Airbus overhauls its top management, acknowledged “challenges” lie ahead but called them “manageable.”

Airbus is facing multiple corruption investigations, notably in Britain, France, and Austria."

Emirates airline announced Thursday that it has reached a deal to buy 20 Airbus A380s with an option for 16 more.

The deal is a breakthrough for Airbus, whose double-decked A380 faced an uncertain future amid weak sales. It was just last week that Airbus sales chief John Leahy acknowledged the jetmaker could end production of the A380 if it did not soon win new orders.

Now, with Thursday's Emirates deal, the A380’s future appears secure for a bit longer.

“This new order underscores Airbus’ commitment to produce the A380 at least for another ten years,” Airbus’ Leahy said in a statement accompanying Thursday’s announcement.

Even Emirates – which already has 101 A380s in its fleet and 41 more on order – seemed to be aware of the significance of its order, worth about $16 billion at list prices.

“This order will provide stability to the A380 production line,” Emirates CEO Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum added in the statement, saying the carrier would “continue to work closely with Airbus to further enhance the aircraft and onboard product.”

Analysts described the order as positive for both Airbus and Emirates.

""It's positive news for both sides,"" airline analyst John Strickland of JLS Consulting said to The Associated Press. ""The A380 is critical to Emirates' hub-and-growth strategy and equally the airline is key to Airbus' continuation of the program. It will be a great relief to Airbus to have secured this order, but they have to work aggressively to secure orders from other airlines too now.""



Emirates is by far the largest customer for Airbus’ A380. The airline also is the world’s top customer for Boeing’s 777 widebody. Combined, the A380 and 777 are the backbone of Emirates' fleet, allowing the fast-growing carrier to offer a robust long-haul schedule from its hub in Dubai.

But it’s perhaps the A380 that is most singularly identified with Emirates. The airline has outfitted its “superjumbo” jets with swanky premium cabins that include showers for first-class passengers. Emirates’ first-class seats – which include a sliding door that can wall them off into private “suites” – helped ignite a war among the world’s top carriers for the most luxurious airline seats.

Emirates' A380s seat 489 to 615 passengers, depending on the seating configuration.

Emirates has accounted for nearly half of Airbus' orders for the A380. And as Airbus worked though its production backlog of the plane, it had become unclear whether the European jetmaker would win new orders needed to keep the line going.

At one point, even Emirates appeared to be reluctant to order more, reportedly pushing Airbus for updates to the aircraft that would make it more efficient to operate. Those concerns have been put to rest, at least for now.

“I’m personally convinced more orders will follow Emirates’ example and that this great aircraft will be built well into the 2030s,” said Airbus’ Leahy.

Airbus' A380 has a list price of $445.6 million, but airlines and manufacturers typically negotiate lower prices on such deals.

Airbus, the European aerospace group that makes the A380 superjumbo, said Monday that it would have to end production of the plane if its only major customer, Emirates, did not order more.

The admission by John Leahy, the company's chief operating officer, was the latest indication that Airbus miscalculated more than two decades ago when it bet that clogged runways would create demand for larger planes that could deliver more people with fewer landing slots. Instead, airlines bypassed the major hubs and ordered midsize planes that could fly directly between regional airports.

""The A380 was better suited to 1995, before air routes fragmented,"" said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Teal Group Corp., a consulting firm in Fairfax, Va.

Airbus said Monday that it has not given up on the plane, but acknowledged that it is endangered.

""If we can't work out a deal with Emirates, I think there is no choice but to shut down the program,"" Leahy said during a webcast with journalists.

""But,"" he added, ""I'm hopeful that we'll work out a deal.""

Emirates, based in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, did not respond to a request for comment.

While it would be premature to write the A380's obituary, there is little doubt that the double-decker plane — once touted as the future of aviation — has been an enormous disappointment and a financial disaster for Airbus, the most formidable competitor to Boeing in the passenger airplane market.

When Airbus started delivering the A380 a decade ago, after spending $25 billion to develop it, the company, based near Toulouse, France, saw the plane as the solution to airport congestion and to increased demand for air travel. Only so many planes can land at an airport in any given day, so Airbus reasoned that planes carrying more people would allow airports to absorb more passengers.

The A380 can carry more than 500 passengers while also offering amenities like showers, first-class suites and a bar.

But the airline industry responded by increasing traffic to smaller airports, a change that favored Boeing and its 787 Dreamliner, a midsize, wide-bodied plane that can carry a maximum of 330 passengers. The Dreamliner has two engines, making it much less expensive to maintain than the four-engine A380.

Aboulafia of Teal Group noted that it is now possible to fly directly to Spain from Washington, D.C., without passing through a large hub like London or Frankfurt, Germany.

""As smaller, more efficient planes flood the market,"" he said in an email, ""new city pairs are being created almost every day, killing the case for larger aircraft.""

Airbus did not book any orders for the A380 last year, the company said Monday. In fact, orders for two planes were canceled.

The superjumbo's poor performance overshadowed an otherwise decent year for Airbus, which said Monday that it delivered 718 aircraft in 2017, a 4 percent increase from the previous year. The company said it had a backlog of orders worth $1.1 billion.

Airbus could further benefit from a general upswing in commercial air travel, and it may profit from a trade dispute between its archrival Boeing and Bombardier of Canada.

The U.S. Commerce Department imposed punitive tariffs on Bombardier last year after Boeing accused it of receiving unfair subsidies from the Canadian government. Bombardier is challenging the tariffs, but has also struck a deal to build its new CSeries midrange planes at an Airbus factory in Alabama. That could allow Bombardier to avoid the penalties.

Airbus's bestseller by far in 2017 was the A320 line, versions of which can carry up to 240 passengers, or about half as many as the A380.

Leahy, the Airbus chief operating officer, said Monday that the A380's best days were ahead. Passenger traffic is doubling every 15 years, he said, meaning that the original rationale for the model still holds.

Airbus, as a result, is still betting that airlines flying between large, highly congested hubs in London or New Delhi will have no choice but to buy larger planes if they want to continue to grow.

""If people want to fly, they need to fly in bigger aircraft,"" Leahy said. ""This is an airplane whose time will come.""

But he acknowledged that, until that day arrives, Airbus needs a minimum of six to eight orders a year to keep production alive at the A380's final assembly plant near Toulouse. For the moment, he said, the only likely customer for those planes is Emirates.

""They are probably the only one who has the ability right now,"" Leahy said."

NANTES, France (Reuters) - Emirates announced a deal for up to 36 Airbus (AIR.PA) A380 aircraft on Thursday worth as much as $16 billion at list prices, saving the world's biggest passenger jet from death row and securing its future for at least another decade.

The European planemaker said Emirates [EMIRA.UL] had placed a provisional order for 20 of the double-decker superjumbos, with an option for 16 more. Deliveries are due to start in 2020.

The agreement hands a lifeline to the slow-selling aircraft, in service for just 10 years, and rescues one of Europe's most visible industrial symbols overseas.

""The A380 is good to go,"" Emirates President Tim Clark told Reuters.

Airbus shares rose more than 3 percent after the announcement to touch a record high of 92.56 euros.

The deal ends months of tough-fought negotiations. Talks between Airbus and Emirates about a fresh A380 order broke down at the last minute at the Dubai Airshow in November, when the Gulf carrier placed an order for 40 smaller Boeing (BA.N) 787s.

Earlier this week, Airbus confirmed a Reuters report that the A380's survival lay with Emirates, saying it would have ""no choice"" but to close production if the Emirates deal fell through despite interest in smaller orders from others.

Emirates and Airbus both said the deal would bring stability to the A380 production line.

The deal marks a final flourish for veteran Airbus sales chief John Leahy, one week before he retires after more than 20 years as the driving force of European aircraft exports.

""Emirates is committing to the program for the long term and plans to take six airplanes a year for 9-10 years,"" the 67-year-old New Yorker told Reuters from onboard an A380 on his way back to France from Dubai.

Calling time on the A380 would not have caused major financial damage to Airbus, but would have been ""emotionally expensive,"" a company source said.

SUPERJUMBO VS TWIN-ENGINES

Leahy said he was now convinced the A380 would be built well into the 2030s.

Story continues

Sales of the A380 have fallen short of expectation and rival Boeing says the future lies with smaller, twin-engine models like its 777 and Dreamliner that offer more flexibility and are at least as efficient.

But Airbus believes its 544-seat superjumbo still has a role as air traffic rises and airports become ever more congested.

The Emirates deal also means a potential revival for one of the world’s largest aircraft engines, co-produced by General Electric (GE.N) and Pratt & Whitney (UTX.N). Their Engine Alliance venture powers most Emirates A380s, but it has lost out to competitor Rolls-Royce (RR.L) on the latest deliveries.

Emirates has, however, appeared unhappy with the performance of the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines. It has invited the two engine makers to compete for the new A380 order, two industry sources said.

Rolls-Royce had no immediate comment. Emirates said it had yet to make a decision on engine supplier.

Emirates' commitment to take six A380s a year for a decade fills a gap in planned production as Airbus touts business from other airlines.

""That provides a base allowing the program to continue so that Airbus can sell two or three planes here, four there,"" Leahy said.

Analysts say Airbus is unlikely to break even on the A380 at such production levels, but that the losses will not make a big impact on the company's accounts, which are dominated by sales of smaller jets worth tens of billions of dollars a year.

Emirates is by far the largest operator of the A380 with 101 in service today and a backlog of 41 superjumbos on order before Thursday's announcement. The last order by another airline for the A380 was in 2015 when Japan's ANA booked three.

Airbus’ new A321LR completed its maiden flight today, marking a major milestone in the expansion of the company’s best-selling A320 airliner product line.

This A321LR variant – its LR designation signifies ‘long range’– is able to cover 7,400 kilometres nonstop, allowing airlines to tap into new long-haul markets, such as transatlantic routes not accessible with current single-aisle aircraft. Its ‘long legs’ are signified by the depiction of a New York-to-Paris route on the fuselage, represented by illustrations of Paris’ Eiffel Tower and the Statue of Liberty in New York.

The A321LR’s interior is based on the A321neo ACF, or Airbus Cabin Flex configuration, itself an evolution of the twin-engine A321neo that has captured more than an 80 percent share in its middle-of-the-market category.

Passenger cabin updates and an additional centre fuel tank

Incorporated in ACF’s interior are a new centre section and modified passenger door/emergency exit arrangement, allowing for 206 passengers in a comfortable two-class layout or up to 240 passengers in single class layout – all with the widest single-aisle fuselage cross-section in the skies. Passengers have the possibility of stowing up to three bags each, and the availability of the Airspace by Airbus cabin further enhances an unrivalled travel experience for passengers.

The A321LR version that performed its maiden flight today features an increased maximum take-off weight and an additional centre fuel tank, extending the aircraft’s range to 7,400 km.

Today’s maiden flight was performed from Airbus’ industrial facility in Hamburg, Germany, with the aircraft powered by CFM International LEAP-1A engines. Nearly 100 hours of flight tests are planned as Airbus seeks A321LR type certification from the European and American airworthiness certifying authorities. Deliveries to airline customers are expected beginning in the fourth quarter of this year."
Singapore reveals delivery date for first Airbus tanker - Defense News,"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXIvMjAxOC8wMS8yMi9zaW5nYXBvcmUtcmV2ZWFscy1kZWxpdmVyeS1kYXRlLWZvci1maXJzdC1haXJidXMtdGFua2VyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MELBOURNE, Australia — Singapore will take delivery of its first Airbus Defence and Space A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport later this year, as the country’s Air Force celebrates its 50th anniversary.

According to a news release issued by Singapore’s Defence Ministry detailing events and activities that the Republic of Singapore Air Force will hold to mark the anniversary, the A330 MRTT will make its first public appearance at a parade on Sept. 1, the date the service was formed in 1968 as the Singapore Air Defence Command.

Am Air Force spokesperson told Defense News that the exact date of the aircraft’s arrival is still being finalized and more details will be announced closer to the event.

The latest photos of the aircraft — taken at Toulouse, France, in November 2017 during the testing and evaluation phase following the conversion to the tanker configuration — show it still in its tan primer and not yet painted in the Air Force’s colors.

Singapore announced its order of six A330 MRTTs in March 2014 to recapitalize its fleet of midair refueling tankers. The Air Force currently operates a fleet of four Boeing KC-135R Stratotankers, acquired and refurbished in 2000 from stored ex-U.S. Air Force airframes.

The Republic of Singapore Air Force also has about five of its 10 Lockheed Martin C-130B/H Hercules airlifters plumbed for the tanker role, although they are no longer used in this role, as the Air Force currently does not operate aircraft equipped for refueling by probe.

The first Air Force A330 MRTT will be delivered in what is known as the MRTT Enhanced configuration, featuring a package of aerodynamic improvements, structural modifications and avionics updates over the previous baseline military variant. France and South Korea will also be receiving their A330 MRTTs in this standard.

RELATED

The A330 MRTTs will be used to support Singapore’s Air Force and possibly its Army training exercises overseas, the latter acting as a transport with a capacity of almost 300 passengers, or almost 75,000 pounds of cargo, in addition to the 245,000 pounds of fuel it can carry and offload.

Due to Singapore’s small size, limited training areas and tropical climate, the southeast Asian country’s armed forces regularly train overseas, with the Air Force’s Singapore-based Boeing F-15SG Eagle fighters and Lockheed Martin F-16C/D Fighting Falcon jets regularly deploying to Australia, Thailand and India for training.

My Thoughts: Boeing Leader Predicted Delta Airbus A321 Order – Could It Doom ”New 757?” - Airline Reporter,"Sat, 06 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxOC8wMS90aG91Z2h0cy1ib2VpbmctbGVhZGVyLXByZWRpY3RlZC1kZWx0YS1haXJidXMtYTMyMS1vcmRlci1kb29tLW5ldy03NTcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The recent announcement by Delta Air Lines that it will be ordering 100 new Airbus A321neo jets could put a nail, or perhaps rivet, into the coffin of a 757 replacement.

I knew this Delta announcement was coming years ago when I was working for Boeing and had an insightful chat with a very high-ranking Boeing executive. The chat was not in a public forum, so I will not say who it was, but trust me – this person knew what he was talking about. He told me that he felt Delta may never buy from Boeing again. He went on to talk about how Delta’s former CEO, Richard Anderson, and its current leadership, was pretty much married to the French conglomerate.

Prior to Delta, Anderson made a couple of big Airbus purchases while heading Northwest Airlines. Delta’s entire A319, A320 and A330 fleet comes from Northwest. So what’s this have to do with the flirtation of a new 757? Delta is far and above the biggest 757 user with 128 757s, a total that was boosted after the 2008 merger with Northwest Airlines. United’s the next-largest passenger carrier at 77 and American is third with 52. The aircraft is still popular in the US, but not as much overseas.

There is obviously a demand and it’s not a secret. For several years, Boeing’s sales honchos liked to fuel talk of a new and improved 757. These folks talked about ’œstudying the issue’ about as much as Cleveland Browns fans talk about winning a single game. Meanwhile, Airbus is doing its best Tom Brady impression by racking up championship rings – thousands of A321 orders and deliveries. Now, Delta has just spiked the football with this big A321 order.

It’s widely known in the airplane sales industry Airbus can literally give planes away, with the carrot that the purchasing airline then remain an Airbus customer for future orders. Boeing’s strategy is to provide a quality product and charge more for it, contending their in-service performance is better than Airbus, so a more expensive plane that isn’t in the maintenance shop is ultimately better for airlines.

This A321 order goes beyond just Delta. The airline also owns 49 percent of both Virgin Atlantic and Aeromexico. It has a ten-percent equity and a board seat with Air France-KLM, 9.5 percent of Brazil-based GOL, and 3.5 percent of China Eastern. By the time this is done, Delta may try to buy part of me ’“ but I’m not selling out unless they bring back those yummy honey-roasted peanuts! Delta’s checkbook is now a worldwide power and its influence over joint venture partners could spell even more orders for Airbus and the A321.

Personally, I love this plane. Ask any pilot (I often do) and they’ll say the 757 is a dream to fly, which performs better than both the 737 and A321. Sure, they’re biased, but 757 pilots I talk with say it’s the best plane Boeing has ever made. Aside from the legendary 747, the 757 is the most visually unique airplane Boeing has ever made in my view. It’s long and lean with an impressive wingspan. It’s a plane I chose to pay a little higher airfare for, just to take on my long-ago honeymoon. I’ve also flown it on a trans-Atlantic route to Berlin from Newark, and many times domestically.

Could there still be some form of new middle market Boeing airplane? Never say never. The big question for cost-cutting Boeing would be where to build it. Internally, Boeing considers Washington a ’œhigh cost’ state, having cut around 20,000 jobs in the past five years. Expanding Boeing’s South Carolina or St. Louis operations won’t be quick turns.

Delta’s order shows the A321 has gobbled up the 757’s old market and Boeing might be too late. The 787-8 provides a market just beyond the 757 and the Boeing 737 MAX 9 and MAX 10 come up short with distance and capacity. So Boeing will need firm evidence of a market that’s still out there for any new plane.

So 757 fans, enjoy it while you can. At least one consolation for “Made in the USA” supporters – newer A321s are being built in Mobile, AL ’“ ironically not far from Delta’s Atlanta headquarters.

Airbus will maintain its commercial aircraft market leadership - Airbus,"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE4LTAxLWFpcmJ1cy13aWxsLW1haW50YWluLWl0cy1jb21tZXJjaWFsLWFpcmNyYWZ0LW1hcmtldC1sZWFkZXJzaGlw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus benefits from the strengths of employees and a global industrial system

Airbus will continue its commercial aircraft leadership in 2018 and beyond – building on the company’s record 718 jetliner deliveries in 2017 and 1,109 net orders logged during the past year.



This was the key message from today’s 2017 year-in-review webcast, during which achievements of the past 12 months were outlined by Fabrice Brégier, Chief Operating Officer of Airbus, and President - Commercial Aircraft; who was joined by John Leahy, Airbus Commercial Aircraft’s Chief Operating Officer - Customers.



“Airbus will continue to build on the strength of its people,” Brégier stated during the live webcast from company headquarters in Toulouse, France. He said the excellence of Airbus employees covers the full spectrum of activities – from management, sales and program teams to the personnel in production and flight test. This is backed by the company’s global industrial footprint – which has expanded beyond Europe with final assembly lines in China and the United States.

Production ramp-up and industry record backlog

Brégier explained that Airbus’ production ramp-up meets the company’s substantial backlog of jetliners to be delivered, which reached an industry record of 7,265 aircraft at the end of 2017. He noted the production output for its best-selling A320 single-aisle jetliner family remains on track to reach 60 aircraft monthly by mid-2019, accompanied by the increase in widebody A350 XWB production to 10 per month by year-end 2018.

Output of the widebody A330 will remain stable at six aircraft per month, based on orders for the current A330ceo version and this year’s start-up of deliveries with the new A330neo variant; while 12 A380s are to be delivered in 2018 as planned.

From the commercial point of view, John Leahy underscored Airbus’ strong market position based on its sales performance over the longer term.



He explained that in terms of net order intake, Airbus has been the world’s largest commercial aircraft manufacturer in nine of the past 10 years – winning 53 percent of all orders. In the single-aisle jetliner market, Airbus outsold its direct competitor in seven out of the last 10 years, capturing 54 percent of net sales; and has outsold the competitor in the widebody passenger aircraft market during seven of the past 10 years, securing 50 percent of net sales.

Airbus has unveiled photographs of the first structurally complete airframe for its new BelugaXL aircraft.

The super transporter is one of the largest aircraft in existence and is used to airlift completed sections of planes from different manufacturing sites in Europe to Airbus's final assembly lines in France, Germany and Spain.

The BelugaXL is six metres longer, one metre wider and holds a payload capacity six tonnes greater than the BelugaST transporter version it is replacing. Airbus said it will be able to transport both wings of an A350 XWB jetliner at once. The present BelugaST transporter can only carry one single wing per flight.

In a press release Tuesday Airbus said the BelugaXL is a highly modified version of the Airbus A330-200 jetliner. Bertrand George, head of the BelugaXL programme said there had been many changes and ""transforming an existing product into a super transporter is not a simple task.""

The initial BelugaXL is expected to be flying by mid-2018 after a sequence of jet engine tests and a paint job. With the first plane rolled out of the way, a second conversion will now begin at the hangar in Toulouse."

Should You Book Turkish's Boeing 777-300ER or Airbus A330? - The Points Guy,"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS8yMDE4LzAxL3R1cmtpc2gtNzc3LXZzLWEzMzAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If you're flying the airline with the most international destinations in the world, Turkish Airlines, you will likely have a choice of either the Boeing 777-300ER or the Airbus A330-300. The two jets form the backbone of Turkish's relatively large long-haul fleet, and both are found on flights to the US.

I tried them both after the Dubai Air Show in November 2017, when I booked a business-class flight home to New York JFK on Turkish, which gave me an opportunity to review the 777-300ER, from Dubai to Istanbul (IST), and the A330-300 from IST to JFK. While I loved the service and especially the outstanding catering on both flights, the seats are almost entirely lacking in privacy — especially the older version, which I found on the much longer A330 leg to JFK. The 2-3-2 arrangement on the 777 is inexcusable, too:

Where They Fly

If you're looking to travel nonstop to or from one of Turkish's US gateways, you probably won't have a choice when it comes to which plane to fly — New York-JFK is the only exception, with one daily flight operated by the A330 and the second with the 777-300ER.

Destination Airbus A330-300 Boeing 777-300ER Atlanta X Boston X Chicago X Houston X Los Angeles X Miami X New York-JFK X X San Francisco X Washington, DC X

Notable Differences

Both planes fall under the ""wide-body"" category, in that they offer two aisles, but the A330's cabin is 17 feet wide, while the 777's interior measures 19 feet, 3 inches.

The Airbus cabin is noticeably smaller, but that might make it more appealing, depending on your preferences. Turkish offers 28 business-class seats in a single cabin on the A330, and a whopping 49 spread between two cabins on the 777.

As with most Airbus planes, the A330's windows are considerably smaller than those on the Boeing 777 — and smaller windows are obviously a minus, except for slightly limiting ambient light in the cabin, perhaps.

From a practical perspective, the 777 is a bit of a time-saver, since it typically cruises at 562 miles per hour, compared to 541mph for the A330. On the JFK flight, that translates to a 10-15-minute shorter block time with the 777, though traffic patterns, winds aloft, turbulence and plenty of other factors could end up eliminating that in-flight advantage.

As far as amenities go, with my particular flights, I much preferred the 777 overall. My 777's cabin was the latest available in Turkish's fleet, which meant a small slide-out privacy divider between seats, a larger, high-definition in-flight entertainment system with a touchscreen controller, a large storage ottoman and an overall fresher feel.

The A330, meanwhile, had Turkish's older seats — they still lie completely flat, and I did find mine to be comfortable both upright and in bed mode, but there's virtually no privacy, and storage is limited as well.

You may unsubscribe at any time.

Of course, one A330 advantage is the 2-2-2 arrangement — which, while not at all competitive when 1-2-1 has become the norm even on the wider 777, sure beats the 2-3-2 seating on Turkish's larger plane. If you end up in one of the paired seats (A and B or J and K), you'll have a similar experience on either model, though.

Both planes offer Wi-Fi, which is free for business-class passengers. I found middling performance on both the A330...

...and the 777-300ER.

Bottom Line

Since Turkish Airlines offers both versions of its seats on both planes, it's challenging to offer up a definitive suggestion here. Based on my own flights, I far preferred the seat on the 777-300ER, but you could end up with the older seat on a 777 and the new version on the A330, in which case you'll probably be best off with the Airbus plane. (I haven't come across any option for confirming which configuration you'll get far in advance, but if you have any suggestions there please share them in the comments below.)

Ultimately, I'd fly Turkish Airlines again, though there's no question that the airline's business-class product is in dire need of an overhaul. Considering my alternatives from the UAE — including A380s operated by Emirates and Etihad — I'm not sure why anyone would opt for a far less private Turkish flight, unless you're able to find a far cheaper fare, or earning miles toward Star Alliance elite status is more important than efficiency and comfort.

The same can be said for flights between Western Europe and the US, too — you'd be backtracking to connect in Istanbul, and unless you can work in a stopover, or the price is right, I think Turkish Airlines is a bit of a hard sell.

H145M successfully launched 70mm Laser Guided Rockets during its firing campaign in Sweden - Airbus,"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wMS1oMTQ1bS1zdWNjZXNzZnVsbHktbGF1bmNoZWQtNzBtbS1sYXNlci1ndWlkZWQtcm9ja2V0cy1kdXJpbmctaXRz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Donauwörth, The successful capability enhancement for the H145M continues. In the first weeks of December 2017, Airbus Helicopters demonstrated the ability to fire laser guided rockets (FZ275 LGR from Thales) with its new H145M platform at the Älvdalen test range of the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration Flight test Centre. In a rough and challenging environment the system performed flawlessly.

The electro-optical system (MX-15D) from L3 Wescam with embedded laser designation enabled a deviation of less than a meter for all rockets fired at a distance of up to 4.5 km. This 70mm laser guided air-ground rocket enhances the H145M’s engagement capabilities. It fulfils the precision strike needs of the armed forces worldwide by reducing the risk of collateral damage, particularly during asymmetric combat operations.

“The laser guided rockets from Thales performed incredibly well especially taking into consideration the weather conditions we experienced during the trials which were far from ideal with a lot of moisture in the air” said Raymond Laporte, test pilot at Airbus Helicopters.

Following the success of the ballistic firing tests, held in Hungary in October 2017, the achievement of this new milestone with laser guided rockets is in continuity of Airbus Helicopters’ HForce development strategy to boost the H145M mission capability.

Final qualification of the ballistic HForce system on the H145M is scheduled for end of this year, while the laser-guided rockets is planned for end 2019.

Frankfurt-based BigCityBeats is hosting a nightclub in an airplane next month. Named World Club Dome Zero Gravity, the event will treat top-tier DJ’s and a small cadre of lucky partiers to a zero gravity rave, Agence France-Presse reports.

“We have already turned many extraordinary locations into a club, but [this] opens up a whole new dimension,” BigCityBeats director Bernd Breiter said in a press release. The company is known for its wacky event locations, including cruise ships and high-speed trains. The club for the evening, a modified Airbus A310, is normally used by European Space Agency astronauts to train for the weightlessness of space.

The event, which BigCityBeats is advertising as the “smallest club in the world” as well as the highest, is set to take off from Frankfurt on Feb. 7 with 55 passengers, including 20 intrepid clubbers. But the adventure will be fleeting — the flight will last 90 minutes, with only 25 minutes in zero gravity-like conditions. Performers will include some of the biggest names in electronic dance music, including Dutch DJ’s Armin van Buuren, and W&W, as well as legendary Los Angeles-based producer Steve Aoki.

“I think it will look really funny,” van Buuren told AFP. “You can make really unique dance moves, like twists in the air, that you wouldn’t normally be able to do on a dance floor.”

The party coincides with the 10th anniversary of the launch of the ESA’s Columbus Laboratory Module to the International Space Station, according to BigCityBeats, and in recognition of the date, two astronauts will also be attending the frontier-breaking bash.

“The feeling of weightlessness is something unique,” said Spanish astronaut Pedro Duque, who will be joined by France’s Jean-Francois Clervoy aboard the in-flight club. “A parabolic flight is the only way you can feel [like you are] in space without having to climb [into] a rocket.”

Flight 1 from Heathrow to Kuala Lumpur is Malaysia Airlines’ flagship service. On Tuesday evening, the plane with this flight number that touched down at the capital’s airport was a very new arrival.

In place of the mighty double-decked, four-engined Airbus A380, the aircraft that taxied to the terminal at the end of a 6,600-mile journey was a single-deck twin-jet that had been delivered fresh from the factory in Toulouse only three weeks ago.

The Airbus A350 may be smaller, but according to Malaysia Airlines’ publicity, it offers passengers “a more spacious interior” on the long-haul from London.

Recommended Why credit card charges hurt the travel industry

Yet the Airbus A380 was made for long-haul routes from London. With a capacity around 500, it can extract the most value from precious slots at Heathrow, the world’s most congested hub.

So why has the Malaysian Airlines carrier downsized? The carrier believes that combination of improved efficiency and passenger appeal will prove more profitable than the superjumbo on its key intercontinental link, and make it better able to compete with British Airways’ nightly Dreamliner service using the Boeing 787.

The airline’s sales team may be quietly relieved, too. In a ferociously competitive market, they have 42 per cent fewer seats to sell on each departure.

For the A380 sales team at the Toulouse HQ of Airbus, last year was not a good year. Airbus had predicted a market for an average of 70 “very large aircraft” sales annually to 2036. At present the only aircraft in this category are the A380 and the Boeing 747-8. But Boeing has predicted a much smaller market, with an average of just 26 sales a year.

Last month the planemaker Airbus delivered a record 127 aircraft. The vast majority were from its highly successful A320 family. Of the 22 wide-bodied planes, a dozen were A330s and nine fresh young A350s. Just one superjumbo was delivered.

According to the maker, the A380 is a “marvel of science and engineering”, and “no other travelling experience comes close”. But the firm’s own spreadsheet reveals net sales last year were minus two: no new orders, and a couple of cancellations.

Only Emirates has demonstrated a strong commitment to the A380: the jet is at the heart of its business model to become people-carrier for the world. The Dubai-based airline has ordered 142, of which around two-thirds have arrived. But at November’s Dubai Airshow, an expected new order for the A380 failed to materialise. Instead, Emirates opted for 40 Boeing 787 Dreamliners.

Shortly before Malaysia Airlines’ new kid in town took off from Heathrow, the bosses at Airbus sounded a warning.

“If we can’t work out a deal with Emirates,” said the planemaker’s top salesman, John Leahy, “I think there is no choice but to shut down the programme.”

Such a move would be deeply humiliating for the European consortium, and an admission that Airbus wasted tens of billions of euros backing the wrong horse. So what went awry with the A380, and is there any prospect that it could come good? These are the key issues.

One careful owner

In the high stakes game of ordering new aircraft, the key unknowable is: a decade from now, what will they be worth?

The launch customer for the A380 was Singapore Airlines. Last summer returned its first superjumbo to the lessor. A 10-year-old, well-maintained jet should have a natural secondhand market. But the aircraft that triumphantly flew from Singapore to Sydney on 25 October 2007 is currently in storage at Lourdes. If a buyer cannot be found, the plane may be broken up for parts.

Until the market establishes a meaningful value for secondhand A380s, airlines and lessors will be disinclined to commit to the superjumbo. And the longer the 9V-SKA (the registration of the launch plane) sits on the ground in south-west France, the more it looks like a dead plane walking.

Too many seats

At a time when aviation is expanding globally at 7 per cent a year, the idea that a plane could have too many seats may seem absurd. Surely it would be far more efficient to replace the motley mix of 757s, 767s, 777s, 787s, A330s and A340s on the London-New York run with A380s, halving the number of flights and freeing up slots? Well, leaving aside the reality that no US airline has expressed interest in the A380, the market on the world’s premier intercontinental air route demands frequency. American Airlines, British Airways, Delta, United and Virgin Atlantic know that the premium passengers who bankroll the link are more interested in the next departure being only an hour away than in the aesthetic appeal of a double-deck jet.

BA, the only one of those carriers with the A380, deploys it mostly on transatlantic routes – but to relatively low-frequency destinations, such as Los Angeles, Miami, San Francisco and Vancouver. (It also flies the superjumbo to Singapore, Hong Kong and Johannesburg.)

You could envisage BA up-gauging some Boeing 747 and 777 routes, such as Dallas and Toronto. The move would cut the cost per seat. But that adds a lot of extra seats to be sold on a wet Wednesday in late January. And all at a time when BA’s Heathrow hub-and-spoke model is already being attacked by budget airlines offering point-to-point options – a model not foreseen a quarter-century ago, when Airbus began looking at a Very Large Commercial Transport.

Too many engines

In 1993, an aircraft of the scale of the A380 could only be conceived with four large engines. In an era when oil was comfortingly below $20 a barrel, fitting two engines on each wing was in vogue – and appreciated by passengers. The four-engined Airbus A340 was about to enter service; when Virgin Atlantic became the launch customer for the A340-600, the stretched version, Richard Branson’s airline promoted it with the slogan “4 engines 4 long haul” – BA’s big rival was the twin-engined Boeing 777.

Today, Sir Richard and just about every other aviation entrepreneur is quite happy with two engines. The fuel burn per seat on the A350 is lower than the A380, while capital and maintenance costs are commensurately reduced.

Pilot films A380 take-off from Heathrow

No prestige premium

Projections for the A380 anticipated inflight shopping malls and gyms, but from the economy passenger’s point of view the reality has been seats, seats and more seats. An unscientific Twitter poll I am conducting suggests about one in three passengers could be more attracted to an airline offering an A380. But the same proportion believe “New planes are better”, and they could switch in the opposite direction. It is telling that Emirates chose to roll out its ultra-luxurious first-class product on a Boeing 777, not an Airbus A380.

Grounds for optimism?

Unless you a first-class passenger on Emirates from Gatwick, you may have noticed the quiet revelation that one of the airline’s three daily departures to Dubai is shortly to change. Same A380, different configuration: no first-class cabin (complete with shower), many more seats in economy, with room for more than 600 (one-third more than on BA). Tickets from the Sussex airport are sold at a discount to those from Heathrow, and this move will help keep fares down. Perhaps the airlines which have installed increasingly elaborate facilities have been looking in the wrong direction; could the answer lie in cramming in many more passengers?

Recommended US ranks UK as dangerous as the Congo in new travel advisory

The A380 is certified for 873 seats, but so far no airline has gone for anything like than number. Passengers are seated a maximum of 10 across, though on the main deck it could easily be 11. While that may horrify travellers who see Ryanair-style standards on long-haul flights, it could transform the economics of flying between very large population centres: Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai…

Airbus chief executive Fabrice Bregier believes there is huge potential in China for the A380: “We need to convince the airlines that they can increase their market share, that they can increase tremendously their image buying the A380 and operating them from big Chinese hubs.

“The biggest market deserves the biggest aircraft.”

It could happen. The rising star at Airbus right now is the A321. When it first appeared in 1993, the “stretch” of the successful A320 earned little attention and few orders. A quarter-century on, with new engines, the A321 has become the aircraft of choice for airlines wanting to open up long-range point-to-point routes, and is very popular with passengers.

The A380 could take a stretch, increasing capacity beyond 900 and cutting seat costs still further. But first an airline needs to take a chance on secondhand superjumbo jets. Malaysia Airlines has some spare now.

Designed to inspire the American public and international workforce, two new graphic identifiers were created to symbolize both the Deep Space Exploration Systems, and their maiden voyage together.

Launching from a modernized Kennedy spaceport in the fall of 2019 will be the first integrated flight of the Deep Space Exploration Systems – NASA’s Orion spacecraft, Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, and Exploration Ground Systems at NASA Kennedy. The first of a series of proving ground missions, Exploration Mission-1 will provide a foundation to enable Earth independence.

Deep Space Exploration Systems enterpirse Identifier

The overall layout was designed to be an abstract visual story, using simple shapes and colors to translate NASA’s exciting new future in space. The circle shape reflects continuous missions into deep space and symbolizes a gateway to future human exploration. Two blue swatches represent both America’s East and West coasts’ – a symbol of the locations of Kennedy Space Center where missions will launch, and the Pacific Ocean where recovery operations of the Orion spacecraft will occur upon its return from deep space.

The Orion spacecraft is represented by the silver swatch, while the shades of orange embody the fire and launch of NASA’s new Space Launch System rocket, and the power it uniquely provides to transport humans to the moon and beyond.

Mars and the Moon are located in the top right section of the emblem above the arc of the blue Earth. The darker grey area of the Moon depicts Orion’s journey beyond the far side of Earth’s Moon, while the black center depicts the lunar proving ground and long-duration stays in deep space. When interpreted as a whole, the color swatch sequence represents a traditional 3,2,1 rocket launch countdown as a tribute to the heritage of past space exploration missions.

Exploration Mission-1 Identifier

The Exploration Mission-1 artwork showcases the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket carrying the Orion spacecraft and lifting off from Launch Pad 39B at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The triangular shape represents the three main programs that comprise NASA’s Deep Space Exploration Systems: Orion, SLS, and Exploration Ground Systems, and is a classic shape for NASA mission patches emblems dating back to the shuttle era.

Several elements within the design carry symbolic meaning for this historic flight. The silver highlight surrounding this patch gives nod to the silver Orion spacecraft, including the European Service Module that will be voyaging 40,000 miles past our Earth’s /Moon. The red and blue mission trajectories encompassing the white full Moon proudly emphasizes the hard work, tradition, and dedication of this American led-mission while also embracing NASA’s international partnership with the European Space Agency as both agencies forge a new future in space.

The Exploration Mission-1 emblem was designed in collaboration by the creative team working for the Deep Space Exploration Systems programs located NASA Headquarters in Washington;, Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Johnson Space Center in Houston, Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama;, and Kennedy. Because the maiden mission of SLS and Orion is uncrewed, the program teams had the rare opportunity to conceive of the mission identifier. Exploration Mission-2, which will fly with crew, will have insignia designed by NASA’s Astronaut Office with the help of the crew that will fly aboard the most capable deep space system to take flight."

Airbus A321LR long-range jet completes maiden flight - Fox Business,"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzIxbHItbG9uZy1yYW5nZS1qZXQtY29tcGxldGVzLW1haWRlbi1mbGlnaHTSAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9haXJidXMtYTMyMWxyLWxvbmctcmFuZ2UtamV0LWNvbXBsZXRlcy1tYWlkZW4tZmxpZ2h0LmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HAMBURG (Reuters) - The A321LR, a long-range version of Airbus's largest and newest single-aisle jet, made its maiden flight on Wednesday as the European planemaker looks to retain part of the market where it has been outselling rival Boeing (NYSE:BA).

The reconfigured version of the 185-230-seat A321neo is capable of carrying up to 240 people. It took off from Airbus' Hamburg factory in northern Germany shortly after 11 a.m. (1000 GMT) and landed just before 2 p.m. (1300 GMT), witnesses said.

Airbus says the jet is the world's longest-range single-aisle aircraft, capable of flying up to 4,000 nautical miles when configured with 206 seats including lie-flat beds.

That makes it a contender to replace long-serving Boeing 757s that are nearing retirement. But Boeing is studying proposals to leapfrog the plane with a compact new twin-aisle jet, designed to serve a broader market from 200 to 270 seats.

A decision on whether to launch the so-called middle-of-the-market passenger jet is expected this year.

Airbus has been outselling Boeing in the market for large single-aisle jets by a margin of four to one and says the new A321LR - with an improved takeoff weight of 97 tonnes - will meet demand to replace elderly 757s and some 767s.

Boeing says the opportunity stretches beyond the 757 replacement market all the way up to planes with 270 seats and would be better served by a completely new airplane. It has, meanwhile, introduced a larger version of its 737 MAX, and last year outsold Airbus three to one in long-haul wide-body jets.

Boeing officials concede the A321LR flies further but say it relies on three, space-absorbing auxiliary fuel tanks, instead of one for the 737 MAX 10 in its longest-range version.

In an effort to pre-empt the possible launch of a new Boeing jet, Airbus is working on further enhancements to the A321 even as it stages the first test of the A321LR, industry sources say.

A person familiar with the Airbus plans told Reuters last week that it was studying a further increase in the A321neo's take-off weight to 100 tonnes with the help of tweaks to the existing wing and stronger landing gear, requiring more engine thrust.

A second option would include a lighter and larger new wing: something that saves on engine thrust but costs more to develop.

Both options would involve stretching the aircraft slightly to accommodate one or two extra rows of seats, the person said.

Airbus has declined to comment on the plans.

Airbus showcased A350-1000 test aircraft in the Middle East and Asia Pacific - STAT Times,"Sat, 27 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXR0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9haXJidXMtc2hvd2Nhc2VkLWEzNTAxMDAwLXRlc3QtYWlyY3JhZnQtaW4tdGhlLW1pZGRsZS1lYXN0LWFuZC1hc2lhLXBhY2lmaWMtYXZpYXRpb24v0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3RhdHRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9haXJidXMtc2hvd2Nhc2VkLWEzNTAxMDAwLXRlc3QtYWlyY3JhZnQtaW4tdGhlLW1pZGRsZS1lYXN0LWFuZC1hc2lhLXBhY2lmaWMtYXZpYXRpb24v?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"January 27, 2018: The newest test aircraft of Airbus' leading widebody family, A350-1000, which recently embarked on its first-leg of a three-week special demonstration tour to 12 destination across the Middle East and Asia-Pacific made its first stop at Qatar.

The Airbus A350-1000 test aircraft was hailed by Akbar Al Baker, group CEO of Qatar Airways. The arrival of the Airbus A350-1000 test aircraft comes barely a month before Qatar Airways is expected to become the global launch customer of the first A350-1000.

The Airbus A350-1000 test aircraft is slated to travel over 30,000 nautical miles with stops in Doha, Muscat, Hong Kong, Seoul, Taipei, Hanoi, Singapore, Bangkok, Sydney, Auckland, Tokyo and Manila.

The aircraft performed an impressive fly-by over to the iconic Doha corniche, which marked the start of its international tour.

According to Qatar Airways, it has placed orders for 37 of the world's most advanced passenger aircraft. Next month it's expected to take delivery of its first aircraft of the Airbus assembly line in Toulouse. The aircraft has been tailor-made with superior-quality cabins to meet the exact specifications of Qatar Airway for its valued passengers.

Said Al Baker: ""We are delighted to welcome the Airbus A350-1000 test aircraft to Doha as part of its special demonstation tour. Its first stop in Doha has special significance for the people of Qatar, as Qatar Airways is the global launch customer for this incredible technologically-advanced aircraft. With this addition to our existing modern fleet, we will continue to set the standard in air travel in the future.""

""The delivery of the world's first commercial A350-1000 next month is highly-anticipated by Qatar Airways passengers and employees. Our expert delivery staff have been working in partnership with Airbus to ensure a prompt entry into service so we can deliver outstanding levels of comfort, thanks to the A350-1000's spacious cabins and advanced technology. We look forward to welcoming the A350-1000 into our growing fleet of over 200 aircraft,"" said Al Baker.

Fabrice Brgier, COO of Airbus said: ""We are delighted that one of our A350-1000 test aircraft visited Doha as its first stop on a global demonstration tour to salute Qatar Airways, which is the global launch customer for the aircraft. At Airbus we look forward to delivering the world's first A350-1000 to Qatar Airways in couple of weeks.""

The test A350-1000 aircraft undertaking the 30,000 nautical mile tour, is one of three owned by Airbus, and is equipped with fully functional business class and economy Class cabins.

The tour follows a highly successful test flight campaign, which demonstrates the aircraft's exceptional design and performance capabilities. The mid-sized long-haul aircraft is assembled by Airbus at its facility in Toulouse, France.

The A350-1000 is 23 feet, which is longer than its sister aircraft, Airbus A350-900, for which Qatar Airways was also the global launch customer. The A350-1000 offers a substantial increase in capacity with extra seating onboard, powerful Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engine, modified wing trailing edge and a new six-wheel main landing gear.

It also offers enhanced level of passenger comfort, thanks to its advanced light-weight carbon composite design and high-quality interior finish.

Meanwhile, in the belly cargo hold, A350-1000 offers greater cargo capacity compared to the A350-900. While the A350-900 has space for 36 cargo containers%u201420 in the front and 16 behind; in the A350-1000, there's space for an extra four cargo containers up front, and another four in the rear, making them a total of 44 containers."
See the Brand-New Airbus A321LR Make Its First Flight - The Points Guy,"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS8yMDE4LzAxL3NlZS10aGUtYnJhbmQtbmV3LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIxbHItbWFrZS1pdHMtZmlyc3QtZmxpZ2h0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The newest Airbus jet took to the skies for the first time on Wednesday, and TPG was by the side of the runway as it took off and returned after a successful flight. The brand new, single-aisle jet is the A321LR, for ""long range,"" and it's the largest and heaviest member of the A320 family. Seating up to 240 people, the LR can fly more than 4,000 miles nonstop, enabling to connect the US East Coast and Europe comfortably.

It's also racking up sales in a segment, 200plus-seater sinlge-aisle jets that can cross oceans, where Boeing did not quite have a directly competing product until recently.

The A321neoLR, as it's also called from ""new engine option,"" is also the launch aircraft for the ""Airbus Cabin Flex"" concept. It's essentially a fuselage modification allowing more space for seats inside a cabin of the same length as before. The most visible modifications are a new rear section, and a new door layout. The classic mark of an A321 are the two doors in front of the wing, whereas all other Airbus single-aisle jets have one. But not on the ACF birds, which have only one but instead feature two small over-wing emergency exits, which the other A321s do not have.

The LR also has a reinforced, newer landing gear to support the increased maximum take-off weight, which has risen to 97 metric tons. The original A321s from the 1990s were 15 percent lighter — the LR can carry more fuel, and has more powerful engines.

The importance of the A321LR is in the fight between Airbus and Boeing for airplanes able to combine the efficiencies of a short-haul jet with the long-haul capability required to connect trans-Atlantic cities where you don't need the big jets. Boeing got to the fight late by stretching even further the 737, creating the 737 MAX 10, which isn't selling as well as the Airbus model. Boeing is also working on an aircraft it calls the MoM or ""middle of market"" that would compete in very much the same segment, but there is no date for its launch yet.

How does the A321LR fly further? Efficiency modifications make the aircraft physically lighter than previous A321 models, enabling it to carry more weight in fuel, in the form of an additional tank that increases range to 4,600 miles.

However, you may remember that a couple of weeks ago, a regular A321neo, without the extra fuel tank, operated by WOW Air stunned everyone by flying over eight hours from Reykjavik (KEF) to Los Angeles (LAX) — well in excess of the expected range of a normal A321neo. That had people thinking that if a normal A321 could go that far, the LR would be able to go much further than those 4,600 miles.

Wednesday in Hamburg, I sat down with the Head of the A320 Family Program Marketing, Amaya Rodriguez - Gonzalez, who told me WOW Air was able to achieve this by blocking some seats onboard, making the aircraft lighter. Just how many seats, we don't know.

With this in mind, I asked Klaus Rowe, Head of A320 Family Program, just how far the A321LR can really fly.

""We know that the maximum range the aircraft could fly is just short of 5,000 nautical miles, but possibly further,"" he said. (5,000 nautical miles equals 5,750 statute miles. That means you could get from Los Angeles all the way to Paris.) But, he added, ""this would only be a possibility if there was a reduced seat count onboard, and we already have airlines asking us to show them how far an 'all business class A321LR' could fly. In fact, we have definite interest from an airline customer for a cabin with only 100 Business Class seats, which could end up flying much, much further"" than the officially advertised range.

In terms of passenger capacity, the current maximum is 240 seats, based on seats with 18-inch seat width. ""We are working to increase it to 244, for our high density customers,"" Rowe said.

Confirmed airline customers of the A321LR include Air Transat, Aer Lingus, Azores Airlines, TAP Portugal and Norwegian Air — which all plan on using the A321LR for transatlantic services, between Europe and both North and South America. Furthermore, airlines including Air Mauritius, Swiss, Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines, and Royal Brunei are considering A321LR orders.

Airbus marketing is clearly aiming this one squarely at trans-Atlantic routes, as you can see below.

For the first flight, the aircraft departed a very wet Airbus' Hamburg Finkenwerder (XFW) airport.

The new jet then took part in various tests including low and high speed tests — a typical Airbus test flight. Anti-ice systems, engine pressurization and cabin checks all took place during the two-hour flight.

After around two hours in the air, the A321LR aircraft made its first landing back at Airbus' German home.

Despite heavy rain, the new jet was greeted by a water cannon salute.

Upon arrival, the flight test crew disembarked the aircraft to cheers and applause.

I caught up with a member of the test flight crew, who said the only ""difficulty"" was the turbulence on approach, making it a particularly bumpy test flight, but other than that everything had performed as expected.

Rodriguez - Gonzalez also told me that the ""mask"" around the cockpit, which first appeared on the A350, then the A330neo, and now the A321LR, has become ""signature Airbus"" meaning that from this month, it's an option given to all airline customers taking A320 family aircraft. So be prepared to see more ""masked Airbus"" around the world.

In another post tomorrow, I'll take you on a tour of the A321LR test aircraft, fresh from its first flight.

An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that JetBlue has ordered the A321LR. In fact, JetBlue has ordered the A321neo, but not the LR version. The story has been corrected."
"Emirates Want More Airbus A380s, but Can't Close Deal - Business Insider","Wed, 17 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZW1pcmF0ZXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtb3JkZXJzLWNhbnQtY2xvc2UtZGVhbC0yMDE4LTHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus may shut down the A380 superjumbo program without an additional order from Emirates.

However, Airbus failed to secure an Emirates order in November because the airplane maker couldn't commit to the A380.

Airbus needs at least one major order to keep its A380 production slots filled for the next decade.



Rumors of the A380's demise have been swirling since Airbus failed to secure a highly-anticipated order for the plane from Emirates at the Dubai Air Show in November.

The Emirates order was supposed to end the A380 pr0gram's prolonged sales drought in which Airbus has not been able to land a major airline order for the superjumbo since Emirates' last order in 2013.

Emirates isn't just the A380's largest customer, at this point, Emirates is the A380's only customer of consequence. It's the only airline with enough demand for the A380 to keep the plane's production lines moving for the next decade or so at a rate of six planes a year.

It's something Airbus knows all too well.

Airbus sales' outgoing sales chief, John Leahy indicated that without additional orders from the Emirates, the possibility of the company shuttering its most high-profile program is very real.

However, the big hangup that prevented Airbus from closing the deal in November wasn't Emirates' lack of interest in the plane. Instead, it was Airbus' unwillingness to commit to the A380 program in the long run.

Related stories

Emirates has openly stated that the airline would like to order more A380s.

""So they may be making some internal decisions as to what they may or may not do, I'm not a party to those, but the view is that at Emirates, we'd like to see some more in the fleet,"" Emirates Airline president Sir Tim Clark told Business Insider.

""I don't know if they've given up (on the A380),"" Clark added. ""It's a work in progress and we're trying to get them across the line.""

Of the 317 orders Airbus has for the plane, 142 have come from the Emirates. Over the years, Emirates has also supplied Airbus with the engineering, design, and maintenance input that helped streamline the A380 program.

Even without additional orders, Airbus has 95 outstanding orders for the A380, 42 of which belong to Emirates.

""We have 101 (A380s in the fleet) at the moment and we have 41 on order,"" the Emirates boss said. ""So they've still got to produce these airplanes. It's all very well to say they are going to end the program but 41 aircraft is quite a lot of that type.""

""We certainly believe there's a future for it,"" Clark said. ""It's very useful for us, it's our flagship, it has great internal product, it has a huge following, and we've just introduced new enclosed suites on our Boeing 777s and we'll do the same on the A380.""

At this point, Emirates wants to buy more A380s and Airbus wants Emirates to buy more of the planes. And yet Emirates doesn't have the planes it wants and Airbus doesn't have the orders it needs."

DOHA (Reuters) - Airbus (AIR.PA) will deliver the first ever A350-1000 jet to an airline to Qatar Airways between Feb. 15 and Feb. 20, the carrier's chief executive said on Saturday.

Delivery of Europe's largest twin-engined passenger jet to launch customer Qatar Airways had been delayed from late last year to some time next month due to issues with installing business class seats.

""We are progressing very well to receive our aircraft somewhere between the 15th and 20th [of February],"" Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker told reporters in Doha.

Qatar Airways has ordered 37 A350-1000s.

The major Middle East airline is known to be a demanding customer when reviewing aircraft for quality defects before delivery. Qatar Airways has in the past refused to take delivery of aircraft over what it said were quality issues, and has also canceled some deliveries.

Airbus looks ""forward to delivering the world's first A350-1000 to Qatar Airways in the coming weeks,"" Airbus' Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier said in a press release issued by the airline.

The ""complex seat configuration"" of Qatar Airways' Qsuite, business class which features seats that face each other, and lie-flat double beds, had delayed the delivery of the A350-1000, until February, Baker said on Monday without detailing a specific date.

The A350-1000 will be the first Airbus jet to feature the Qsuite, which was unveiled last year and has been installed on Qatar Airways' Boeing (BA.N) 777 jets, Baker said.

The A350-1000 is the largest version of the A350 series, and was launched to compete against Boeing's 777s in the up to 400-seat market.

Baker, speaking to reporters on board one of Airbus' A350-1000 test aircraft, said the airline expected to receive four of the twin-engined jets this year.

""This is contractually and I am confident that Airbus will deliver them to us,"" he said.

Qatar Airways plans to initially fly its first A350-1000 on long haul routes before adding it to ultra long-haul routes in a few months time, in case of any potential technical issues with the new jet.

Baker said the airline hoped to take delivery of its first Boeing 777x by the first half of 2020.

The airline has ordered 60 the new 777x jets, according to data on Boeing's website.

DUBAI, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- Dubai's government-controlled Emirates Airline, the international carrier of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), said on Thursday it had purchased 36 additional Airbus A380s.

Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum, chairman and chief executive of the Emirates Airline, signed the memorandum of understanding (MoU) earlier Thursday with John Leahy, chief operating officer customers of Airbus Commercial Aircraft, at the airlines' headquarters in Dubai.

The aircraft will be delivered to Emirates from 2020 onwards. Together with the airline's 101-strong A380 fleet and its current order backlog for 41 aircraft, the 16-billion-U.S.-dollar new deal brings the Emirates' A380 fleet to 178 aircraft.

""Some of the new A380s we have just ordered will be used as fleet replacement,"" said the Emirates' chairman.

Last November, Airbus almost sealed a deal on additional A380 purchase with Emirates, before the UAE's carrier changed its plan and bought 40 Boeing 787 Dreamliners instead.

Emirates' move raised speculations among aviation experts about a possible end of the production of the European ""double-decker"" plane.

""The deal reflects Emirates' confidence in shaping the future and its commitment to advancing Dubai's vision to grow further as a world-class destination and aviation hub,"" said Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE."

European aircraft maker Airbus on Monday released sales results for its 2017 fiscal year. The company delivered a record 718 new commercial jets and booked 1,109 net new orders for the year. The book-to-bill ratio reached 1.5, well above Boeing Co.’s (NYSE: BA) book-to-bill of 1.2.

The 2017 total includes 558 single-aisle A320 Family (181 A320neos), 67 A330s, 78 A350 XWBs and 15 A380s. The 1,109 net orders came from 44 customers, and the company ended the year with an overall backlog of 7,265 aircraft valued at US$1.06 trillion at list prices. (Boeing’s backlog is valued at the actual contract price and has about half the value of Airbus’s. Beginning this year new international accounting rules will require Airbus to value its backlog in the same way Boeing now does.)

Airbus has lost a top executive and loses two more in the next 15 months. First to go was sales chief John Leahy who retired. Next to go will be commercial aircraft chief operating officer and president of Commercial Aircraft Fabrice Brégier, who leaves next month. CEO Tom Enders indicated in December that he will not seek an extension to his contract when it expires in April 2019. Guillaume Faury will replace Brégier, and Leahy’s replacement is Eric Schulz.

The company pulled off its biggest-ever order at the Dubai Air Show in November. Private equity firm Indigo Partners, on behalf of four of its airlines, placed an order for 430 A320s. The order was finalized in December. Without it, the company’s book-to-bill would have been less than one.

In addition to its orders and deliveries, the company also posted its 2018 price list. The new pricing includes a 2% increase across the entire product line. Discounts of 30% to more than 50% of the list price are common for both Airbus and Boeing. Here’s the price list by model:

A318: $77.4 million

A319: $92.3 million

A320: $101 million

A321: $118.3 million

A319neo: $101.5 million

A320neo: $110.6 million

A330-900(neo): $296.4 million

A350-800: $280.6 million

A350-900: $317.4 million

A350-1000: $366.5 million

A380: $445.6 million

One final note: Airbus made it abundantly clear that it will cease production of the A380 unless the single customer pushing for a new version of the plane (the UAE’s Emirates) places orders that maintain a production rate over a minimum of six per year until 2030. Airbus plans to build 12 of the superjumbo double-deckers this year and eight next year. According to Leeham News, Brégier said:

From 2020 it would be possible to keep the program running with an acceptable industrial result at a minimum rate of six aircraft per year. The orders for these aircraft would have to come from Emirates, as other airline orders would be marginal.

Boeing delivered its own record of 763 new commercial jets last year.

The days may be numbered for the world’s largest passenger aircraft.

Airbus, the European aerospace group that makes the A380 superjumbo, said Monday that it would have to end production of the plane if its only major customer, Emirates, did not order more.

The admission by John Leahy, the company’s chief operating officer, was the latest indication that Airbus miscalculated more than two decades ago when it bet that clogged runways would create demand for larger planes that could deliver more people with fewer landing slots. Instead, airlines bypassed the major hubs and ordered midsize planes that could fly directly between regional airports.

“The A380 was better suited to 1995, before air routes fragmented,” said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Teal Group Corp., a consulting firm in Fairfax, Virginia.

Airbus said Monday that it has not given up on the plane, but acknowledged that it is endangered.

“If we can’t work out a deal with Emirates, I think there is no choice but to shut down the program,” Leahy said during a webcast with journalists.

“But,” he added, “I’m hopeful that we’ll work out a deal.”

Emirates, based in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, did not respond to a request for comment.

While it would be premature to write the A380’s obituary, there is little doubt that the double-decker plane — once touted as the future of aviation — has been an enormous disappointment and a financial disaster for Airbus, the most formidable competitor to Boeing in the passenger airplane market.

When Airbus started delivering the A380 a decade ago, after spending $25 billion to develop it, the company, based near Toulouse, France, saw the plane as the solution to airport congestion and to increased demand for air travel. Only so many planes can land at an airport in any given day, so Airbus reasoned that planes carrying more people would allow airports to absorb more passengers.

The A380 can carry more than 500 passengers while also offering amenities like showers, first-class suites and a bar.

But the airline industry responded by increasing traffic to smaller airports, a change that favored Boeing and its 787 Dreamliner, a midsize, wide-bodied plane that can carry a maximum of 330 passengers. The Dreamliner has two engines, making it much less expensive to maintain than the four-engine A380.

Aboulafia of Teal Group noted that it is now possible to fly directly to Spain from Washington, D.C., without passing through a large hub like London or Frankfurt, Germany.

“As smaller, more efficient planes flood the market,” he said in an email, “new city pairs are being created almost every day, killing the case for larger aircraft.”

Airbus did not book any orders for the A380 last year, the company said Monday. In fact, orders for two planes were canceled.

The superjumbo’s poor performance overshadowed an otherwise decent year for Airbus, which said Monday that it delivered 718 aircraft in 2017, a 4 percent increase from the previous year. The company said it had a backlog of orders worth $1.1 trillion.

Airbus could further benefit from a general upswing in commercial air travel, and it may profit from a trade dispute between its archrival Boeing and Bombardier of Canada.

The U.S. Commerce Department imposed punitive tariffs on Bombardier last year after Boeing accused it of receiving unfair subsidies from the Canadian government. Bombardier is challenging the tariffs, but has also struck a deal to build its new CSeries midrange planes at an Airbus factory in Alabama. That could allow Bombardier to avoid the penalties.

Airbus’s best-seller by far in 2017 was the A320 line, versions of which can carry up to 240 passengers, or about half as many as the A380.

Leahy, the Airbus chief operating officer, said Monday that the A380’s best days were ahead. Passenger traffic is doubling every 15 years, he said, meaning that the original rationale for the model still holds.

Airbus, as a result, is still betting that airlines flying between large, highly congested hubs in London or New Delhi will have no choice but to buy larger planes if they want to continue to grow.

“If people want to fly, they need to fly in bigger aircraft,” Leahy said. “This is an airplane whose time will come.”

But he acknowledged that, until that day arrives, Airbus needs a minimum of six to eight orders a year to keep production alive at the A380’s final assembly plant near Toulouse. For the moment, he said, the only likely customer for those planes is Emirates.

“They are probably the only one who has the ability right now,” Leahy said."

Brazil orders additional Airbus C295 search and rescue aircraft - Airbus,"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wMS1icmF6aWwtb3JkZXJzLWFkZGl0aW9uYWwtYWlyYnVzLWMyOTUtc2VhcmNoLWFuZC1yZXNjdWUtYWlyY3JhZnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Brazil has ordered an additional Airbus C295 search and rescue (SAR) aircraft that will eventually take to 15 the number of C295s in service with the Brazilian Air Force (FAB).

This latest order constitutes the firming of an option included in an earlier contract in 2014. It was signed at the end of last year and will therefore be included in the 2017 orderbook. The three SAR aircraft will serve alongside 12 transport-configured C295s already delivered.

The first of the three SAR aircraft was delivered last year and performed a successful five week tour through four continents before arriving in Brazil. The aircraft demonstrated its maritime patrol and search and rescue capabilities in a wide range of environments and recorded 100% availability during the tour.

The second FAB C295 SAR will be delivered in 2019 and the third in 2020.

More than 200 C295s have now been ordered by 26 countries. In the Latin American region, more than 100 Airbus military transport aircraft of all kinds are now in operation."
