Former Airbus Americas Executive Outlines Top Five Future Challenges - ERAU News,"Fri, 27 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5lcmF1LmVkdS9oZWFkbGluZXMvZm9ybWVyLWFpcmJ1cy1hbWVyaWNhcy1leGVjdXRpdmUtb3V0bGluZXMtdG9wLWZpdmUtZnV0dXJlLWNoYWxsZW5nZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For Embry-Riddle students hoping to score plum aviation and aerospace positions, former Airbus Americas CEO and President Barry Eccleston shared a “shopping list of exciting things to work on” during his first-ever visit to the Daytona Beach Campus on Sept. 24.

Topping Eccleston’s list of future engineering challenges were urban air mobility, pilotless flight, more environmentally friendly aircraft, factories of the future, and space exploration, from the moon to Mars.

“I love it when people tell me it can’t be done,” he said in a candid talk about his career, including highlights such as flying over the English Channel in F-4 Phantom aircraft and spearheading the sale of more than 200 Airbus planes to American Airlines. “If someone tells you it can’t be done, that’s your challenge.”

In the 1950s and ‘60s, “the old mantra was faster, further, higher,” he told an auditorium packed with students at a Presidential Speaker Series event, organized by the Office of the Provost. “Today, it is cheaper, quicker and more reliable.”

An aeronautical engineer and pilot who recently earned his instrument rating at age 71, Eccleston led Airbus Americas for 12 years before retiring in 2018. He also served as vice president and general manager for Honeywell’s Propulsion Systems Enterprise and as Honeywell’s vice president of commercial aerospace across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. In addition, he held positions with Fairchild Dornier Corporation, Rolls-Royce and International Aero Engines.

Seeking Inspiration

Eccleston graduated from Loughborough University in England in 1969, the year the first Boeing 747 took off. The Concord supersonic airliner also debuted in 1969, and that same year, Apollo 11 landed on the moon. “There was no lack of inspirational people and programs,” he recalled of that time. After graduating, Eccleston joined the Graduate Apprenticeship scheme at Rolls-Royce.

Today, the top U.S. aircraft manufacturers, Airbus and Boeing, are not currently developing new models, Eccleston noted. “But don’t forget,” he added, “the majority of the money today is coming from the commercial business. We will still need to build better and cheaper airplanes.” In an industry that has seen eight straight years of growth, pilots, aviation maintenance professionals, engineers and innovators are in high demand, he said.

Inspiring new technological challenges are on the horizon, Eccleston said, citing the critical need to reduce the environmental impacts of flight: “This doesn’t mean making airplanes that are 10 percent more efficient, but rather, new forms of energy. It means hybrid airplanes, electric airplanes, maybe hydrogen airplanes.”

Pilotless aircraft currently face tough opposition, but as public attitudes change, new unmanned technologies will find broader use in stages, perhaps first for cargo deliveries, Eccleston said, and “in places like Dubai and Singapore, it will happen more quickly.”

Confidence, Humility, Trust, Integrity

Eccleston’s talk, moderated by Jim Myers, an Embry-Riddle sophomore pursuing a degree in Aviation Business Administration, included effective leadership strategies as well as frank discussion about bouncing back from career low points. He urged today’s students to be confident yet also humble, and to put personal integrity above all else.

“Assume the people you meet are good people,” he said. “Listen to your customers. Trust your people. Establish great teams. You may be the greatest mind in the room, but remember that collectively, you’re even smarter.” As a business leader, he added, once a decision is made, stick to it and “ensure that everyone is rowing in the same direction.”

Noting that being honest about personal failures can help others, Eccleston described two “down times” in his career — first, when he moved to Canada to run a factory without fully learning the ropes first, and later, when the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 caused customers to cancel or postpone airplane orders, effectively putting his firm out of business. At the factory, Eccleston said, he didn’t address bottom-line issues quickly enough, put his trust in the wrong people, and didn’t recognize the need for tough cost-cutting measures. After Sept. 11, Eccleston was out of work for six months before he joined Honeywell.

Eccleston said that Embry-Riddle students have an advantage in the job market. “If you’re in the aviation industry, Embry-Riddle is the go-to place,” he said. “Those of you who are here are already on the right track.”

The Presidential Speaker Series on Embry-Riddle’s Daytona Beach Campus welcomes industry leaders, prominent alumni and trailblazers in aviation, aerospace and related fields. Each 90-minute dialogue is free and open to students, faculty, staff and the community.

On Oct. 30 at 6:30 p.m., Mauro Atalla, vice president for engineering and technology at Collins Aerospace will share his insights in the Henderson Welcome Center, Duva Ballroom.

Airbus hit by series of cyber attacks on suppliers - FRANCE 24 English,"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi8yMDE5MDkyNi1haXJidXMtaGl0LWJ5LXNlcmllcy1vZi1jeWJlci1hdHRhY2tzLW9uLXN1cHBsaWVyc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris (AFP) –

European aerospace giant Airbus has been hit by a series of attacks by hackers who targeted its suppliers in their search for commercial secrets, security sources told AFP, adding they suspected a China link.

There have been four major attacks on Airbus in the last 12 months, according to two security sources involved in investigating the hacking.

The group has long been considered a tempting target because of the cutting-edge technologies that have made it one of the world's biggest commercial plane manufacturers, as well as a strategic military supplier.

In January, it admitted to a security incident that ""resulted in unauthorised access to data"", but people with knowledge of the attacks outlined a concerted and far bigger operation over the last year.

Hackers targeted British engine-maker Rolls-Royce and the French technology consultancy and supplier Expleo, as well as two other French contractors working for Airbus that AFP was unable to identify.

Airbus and Rolls-Royce did not immediately reply to AFP's request for comment. Expleo said it would neither ""confirm nor deny"" that it had been targeted.

Romain Bottan of the aerospace security specialist BoostAerospace said the attacks showed that hackers were seeking out weak links in the chain to compromise Airbus's systems.

""Very large companies are very well protected, it's hard to pirate them, so smaller companies are a better target,"" he said.

- VPN entry point -

The attack against Expleo was discovered at the end of last year but the group's system had been compromised long before, one of the sources told AFP on condition of anonymity.

""It was very sophisticated and targeted the VPN which connected the company to Airbus,"" the source said.

A VPN, or virtual private network, is an encrypted network that enables employees to access company systems remotely.

Airbus suppliers sometimes operate in a VPN linking them with colleagues at the plane-maker.

The other attacks used the same methods, with the first of them detected at a British subsidiary of Expleo, formerly known as Assystem, as well as Rolls-Royce, which provides engines for Airbus planes.

According to several of the sources, the hackers appeared to be interested in technical documents linked to the certification process for different parts of Airbus aircraft.

They also said that several stolen documents were related to the engines of the Airbus military transport plane A400M, which has some of the most powerful propeller engines in the world.

One of the sources said the hackers were also interested in the propulsion systems for the Airbus A350 passenger jet, as well as its avionics systems controlling the plane.

- Who to blame? -

None of the sources who spoke to AFP could formally identify the perpetrators of the attacks, pointing to the extreme difficulty in obtaining evidence and identification in any cyber attack.

Many state-backed and independent hackers are known to use tools to disguise their tracks, or they may leave clues intended to confuse investigators or lead them to blame someone else.

But the sources said they suspected Chinese hackers were responsible, given their past track record of stealing sensitive commercial information and the existence of a motive.

China has launched manufacturing of its first mid-range airliner, the C919 but the group behind it -- state-owned planemaker Comac -- is struggling to gain certification.

Engines and avionics are ""areas in which Chinese research and development is weak,"" one of the sources said.

In its quest to break the stranglehold of Airbus and its US rival Boeing on the global aircraft market, Beijing also has ambitions to build a long-haul jet called the C929, which will be developed in partnership with Russia.

Several sources said they believed a group of hackers linked to the Chinese Communist Party, known as APT10, could be behind the attacks.

The United States considers APT10 to be state-backed hackers linked to the Chinese intelligence services and military.

But another source pointed to another group of Chinese hackers known as JSSD, which are believed to operate under the regional security ministry in the coastal state of Jiangsu.

""The JSSD is focused on the aerospace industry,"" one source said, explaining that they employ people ""familiar with the language, the software and aerospace codes.""

In October 2018, the US Justice department named several JSSD officers as being responsible for a hacking operation targeting an engine being developed by US-based General Electric and French aerospace group Safran.

""At the time of the intrusions, a Chinese state-owned aerospace company was working to develop a comparable engine for use in commercial aircraft manufactured in China and elsewhere,"" a US statement said.

France and Airbus have been left in a delicate position by the discovery of the hacking attacks, sources told AFP, with the country and company needing to take into account their commercial ties with China.

- Achilles' heel -

The attacks show up the vulnerability of Airbus to intrusions via its global supplier network, and the value of its technology to foreign countries.

""The aerospace sector is the one that suffers most from cyberattacks, mostly through spying or people seeking to make money from this industry,"" said Bottan of BoostAerospace.

There is also a major industrial risk for Airbus, with hackers potentially able to knock out production for strategic suppliers which would have a knock-on effect on production.

""If someone wanted to slow down production, they can quickly identify the critical supplier, the single sources, which are unique in their role,"" one expert said.

Belgian aerospace design and manufacturing firm ASCO had a major IT meltdown earlier this year caused by malware, and it took a month to restore its systems, one source said.

That incident hit Airbus production.

The real reason Airbus is retiring its A380 superjumbo jet - WIRED,"Wed, 04 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9haXJidXMtYTM4MC1yZXRpcmVtZW50L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Apart from Emirates, a number of other airlines, including Lufthansa and Air France – airlines of Germany and France, the main manufacturers of the Airbus A380 – have also decided to stop buying the planes. Lange says that if an airline can fill an A380, the plane will generate $150m (£124m) of revenue per year. But the challenge is filling all those seats. The two 49.9 metre decks of an A380 can, at their maximum capacity, contain 868 people.

Lufthansa sold six A380s back to Airbus earlier this year, saying that they were unprofitable. Qantas cancelled its last A380 order in February, just like Emirates, keeping only 12 jumbo jets. Qatar Airlines, which has ten A380s in its fleet, has announced it will switch to Boeing 777Xs from 2024. So what went wrong?

The A380’s capacity was supposed to be its biggest advantage. “Most of the world’s major airlines told us they needed a larger aircraft to cope with traffic growth and congestion,” says Lange. Bigger planes meant fewer terminal gates would be needed to accommodate more people.

Plus, more seats meant more passengers, which meant lower fares. Everybody prefers flying direct, but passengers’ biggest factor of choice is the ticket price. So even though the superjumbo jets – with their whopping 80-metre wingspans – could only travel between big city hub airports, passengers were willing to deal with a stopover to pay a little less.

And once a plane ages, the cabin should be upgraded. The more seats there are to upgrade, the more costly it gets. That was one of the reasons Air France, the first European airline to fly the jet, decided to ditch A380 on August 5. The estimated cost of upgrading economy and business classes, at over $45 million (£37m), was just too much compared to investing into newer aircraft instead. That was just one of the reasons the French airline decided to retire all of its ten A380s by 2022 and instead replace them with 60 smaller Airbus A220-300s, with 149 passenger capacity.

Then there is the external design. A380 sports four engines, and one of the consequences of its launch was more investment in aircraft engines, significantly pushing the limits of how powerful an engine can be. Technology quickly evolved and now a new generation of super-efficient, twin-engine planes, such as Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner and Airbus’s own A350, offer an even lower price point. That’s where airlines are investing their money, says Andrew Smith, director of Deloitte’s global transport practice.

“Given that fuel is the biggest operating cost for an airline, anything airlines can do to lock in lower fuel and maintenance costs is likely to be highly attractive,” he says. “In many cases, airlines have opted to base their fleet renewal plans around these twin-engine variants, in some cases even bring forward the planned retirement dates of quad-engined aircraft as a consequence.” So while the four-engine A380 still provided an unmatched passenger experience, that wasn’t enough to keep orders flying in.

While a little embarrassing and very expensive, the early shuttering of the A380 project hasn’t left Airbus in disarray. Despite the closure, and accompanying double-digit-billion-dollar loss, Airbus more than doubled its profits in the first half of this year, compared to the same period in 2018. And the technology developed for the A380 hasn’t been lost, having already been put to use in smaller Airbus planes. “We put so much innovation into that aircraft,” says Lange. “There are far more than 380 patents on the A380.”

Airbus claims $2B in savings if Australia sticks with Tiger helo amid replacement bids - Defense News,"Mon, 09 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbnNlbmV3cy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvMjAxOS8wOS8wOS9haXJidXMtY2xhaW1zLTJiLWluLXNhdmluZ3MtaWYtYXVzdHJhbGlhLXN0aWNrcy13aXRoLXRpZ2VyLWhlbG8tYW1pZC1yZXBsYWNlbWVudC1iaWRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MELBOURNE, Australia — Australian taxpayers will save AU$3 billion (U.S. $2 billion) out to 2040 by incrementally upgrading the Australian Army’s 22 Tiger helicopters, rather than replacing the fleet, according to an Airbus official.

Australia is seeking to replace its Airbus-made Tiger armed reconnaissance helicopters with up to 29 proven, mature, off-the-shelf armed helos under Project Land 4503 following a request for information on July 10. The country’s requirement is for up to 24 helicopters to equip two operational squadrons, with five further airframes for training. The RFI specifies an initial operational capability (IOC) in the 2026 time frame and a final operational capability (FOC) to follow around 2028.

Airbus Australia Pacific Managing Director Andrew Mathewson said Aug. 30 that the company’s offering will leverage technology from the European Tiger Mark III program. He added that upgrading the Tiger from the mid-2020s will save compared to acquiring a new type, which itself would need future upgrades if it is to serve until 2040, by which time he said the Australian government hopes to leverage the U.S. military’s Future Vertical Lift program, or FVL.

“Defense has been very plain that they’re focusing on FVL. To replace Tiger in the time frame outlined, acquire a new capability in the early 2030s and have it replaced in the early 2040s I think would be a waste of money,” he said.

The upgrade would take place at Airbus Australia Pacific’s Brisbane facility, which previously assembled 18 of the 22 Tigers.

Boeing on Aug. 30 also publicly announced its proposal for the helo competition. The company would combine the U.S. Defense Department’s Foreign Military Sales and Direct Commercial Sales programs and the Australian Industry Capability process to provide the AH-64E Apache to Australia.

On Sept. 5, Darren Edwards, the managing director of Boeing Defence Australia, said the proposal includes 29 AH-64E Version 6 Apache helicopters, which is the latest production standard delivered to the U.S. Army. The helo features the upgraded Northrop Grumman APG-78 Longbow fire Ccontrol radar with enhanced maritime and air-to-air modes.

“There are elements of the Apache acquisition that must be sold as FMS, [but] there are also elements which can be a DCS,” he said. “There are cost benefits to FMS [and] there are regulatory [U.S.] State Department requirements where we don’t have [a] choice. But where we can move things into a DCS, it will give us the opportunity to bolster local industry content here in Australia.”

Bell also submitted a response to the RFI. Global military business manager for the Asia-Pacific region, Javier Ball, confirmed to Defense News on Sept. 5 that the company proposed 29 AH-1Z Viper helicopters. “The RFI stated up to 29 helicopters, and that’s what our response was,” Ball said. “We can easily make the IOC and FOC deadlines.”

Bell signed a partnering agreement at the 2016 Singapore Airshow with BAE Systems Australia, whereby the latter company will provide in-country support for a future AH-1Z bid.

“We’re looking at the maintenance, training and sustainment being done in Australia, and we’ve teamed with BAE Australia to perform the AIC,” Ball said. “In the future, there’s potential for a regional maintenance center in Australia. I think there’s potential for partners in the region to bring their aircraft down here.”

Airbus irked by Spain's choice of fighter jet partner - Tech Xplore,"Sat, 21 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHhwbG9yZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDE5LTA5LWFpcmJ1cy1pcmtlZC1zcGFpbi1jaG9pY2UtZmlnaHRlci5odG1s0gFJaHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoeHBsb3JlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMTktMDktYWlyYnVzLWlya2VkLXNwYWluLWNob2ljZS1maWdodGVyLmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The combat fighter is to go into service in 2040

Airbus has sharply criticised Madrid for choosing defence systems specialist Indra to coordinate Spain's participation in a Franco-German project to develop a new-generation fighter jet, in which the aviation giant is deeply involved.

The decision, which was taken by the defence ministry in late August, saw Indra chosen to coordinate Spain's work on a stealth fighter whose development is being led by Airbus and France's Dassault Aviation.

Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury told online business journal El Confidencial the group ""didn't see the decision coming"" as it was expected to be selected. He said that Indra was a sensors and equipment producer but had no capabilities in airplanes, drones nor satellites.

""You don't want someone who makes wheels or computers designing your car. You want a carmaker,"" he told El Confidencial on a visit to Spain to convince the government to rethink its decision.

Indra is a Spanish technology and defence group which had sales of 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) in 2018. Airbus group sales in the same year totalled 63,7 billion.

The ambitious Future Combat Air System (FCAS) project will combine a new generation fighter plane with drones, satellites and other aircraft to help reduce the EU's long reliance on US planes and equipment.

It aims to have the new plane operational by 2040, when it will replace the current generation of Rafale and Eurofighter jets.

Speaking to El Confidencial at the start of his visit, Faury said it was ""difficult to imagine"" anyone coming in for the design phase who didn't have the same expertise as Airbus ""in planes, drones or satellites, but only in systems and sensors"".

But in a separate interview with El Confidencial on the same day, Defence Minister Angel Olivares showed no willingness to reverse the decision.

""This is not a circumstantial decision, which can be changed overnight. We have decided on Indra, and we will continue to insist that they work together with Airbus and the rest of the industry.""

He also expressed the government's frustration at its weakening influence within the Airbus Group, in which it holds a four percent stake, compared with the 12 percent held by France and by Germany.

""The relative importance of Spain within Airbus is shrinking,"" he said.

""In the latest restructuring, Airbus Spain's management no longer has an active role on the executive committee of the Group, for the first time.""

Since 2015, Spain's representative on the board of directors has been chosen by Airbus itself, against the wishes of the Spanish government.

A series of cyberattacks on Airbus in the past few months were conducted via the computer systems of the aerospace group's suppliers and contractors, and security sources suspect a link to China, AFP news agency reported on Thursday.

Airbus, the world's second-largest aerospace group, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.

The company said in January this year that a cyberattack on its systems had resulted in a data breach. Last year U.S. prosecutors said Chinese intelligence officers and hackers stole information about a jet engine being developed by firms who supply Airbus as well as its U.S. rival Boeing .

According to the AFP report, which cited multiple unnamed security sources, cyberattacks in the past months on Airbus were mounted via French technology consultancy Expleo, engine maker Rolls Royce , and two French Airbus subcontractors which were not identified.

Over the past 12 months, Airbus has been targeted by four major cyber-attacks, AFP cited one of the sources as saying. Some of the attacks date back further, the report said.

The report cited the sources as saying that the hackers appeared to have been seeking information about engines for the A400M military transport aircraft and A350 airliner.

Airbus A320neo engines and the faults with them | Mint - Mint,"Mon, 02 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9jb21wYW5pZXMvbmV3cy9haXJidXMtYTMyMG5lby1lbmdpbmVzLWFuZC10aGUtZmF1bHRzLXdpdGgtdGhlbS0xNTY3NDQ2OTU3NzYwLmh0bWzSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWEzMjBuZW8tZW5naW5lcy1hbmQtdGhlLWZhdWx0cy13aXRoLXRoZW0vYW1wLTE1Njc0NDY5NTc3NjAuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Passengers of IndiGo and GoAir—the two airlines operating Airbus A320neo planes powered by Pratt and Whitney (P&W) engines—have faced delays, cancellations, and, importantly, a threat to their safety as glitches related to this engine surfaced. Mint takes a look at the issue.

What’s the P&W engine powering A320neos?

The P&W 1100G-JM engine that powers A320neo planes is a “fan driven-geared turbine engine"" manufactured by US-based P&W. The engine has been “type certified"" by the Federal Aviation Administration of the US and, subsequently, by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency. It is more fuel efficient, generates more thrust, and produces less noise and is environment friendly. At present, there are 127 P&W engine-powered A320neo aircraft in India and 436 operating globally. In India, IndiGo operates 92 P&W powered A320neo planes, while GoAir has 35 such aircraft in its fleet.

What are the technical problems?

Airlines operating this aircraft have faced several problems with the engine. The major ones involve combustion chamber distress, low pressure turbine (LPT) and gear box failures, engine vibration, among others. While some issues, such as combustion chamber distress, have been addressed, P&W is working on suitable mitigation measures to resolve the remaining problems. To resolve problems related to LPT failure, redesigned and more durable LPT stage 3 blades are being incorporated, while a redesigned piston seal in the high pressure compressor will be used to address transient vibration.

What happens when a fault is detected?

The engines are removed and sent for maintenance or modification. Those with gear box issues are immediately sent for a software update. This has been done on all such engines in India.

What is the aviation regulator doing?

Measures taken by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to detect problems early include removal of engines to prevent glitches, and more frequent combustion chamber inspections and engine replacements. DGCA has asked airlines to log all cases of detection of odour or smoke in the cabin during operations, monitor and inspect engines in case of vibration. It is also restricting the operation of A320neo aircraft with P&W engines on the Port Blair sector as the plane has to fly over water bodies.

How are the remaining issues being tackled?

All A320/321neo aircraft inducted after August must be installed with a modified main gear box (MGB) and new modified third stage LPT blades. At present, no engine from maintenance, repair and overhaul units is accepted unless installed with modified MGBs and new LPT blades. This excludes those which are at final stages in shop or in transit. There is also a restriction on acceptance of lease engines without modified LPT and MGB. The engine failure related to MGB is expected to be contained after software updates.

On the platform, UP42 offers startups and application developers access to algorithms related to agriculture, object detection and change detection as well as tools to prepare satellite imagery for data analysis.

“With the launch of our new platform, we are looking to open up access not only to satellite imagery and data, but also to a range of analysis tools to help understand it,” UP42 CEO Eli Tamanaha said in a statement. “By using UP42, customers will be able to easily discover actionable insights to make data-driven decisions and geospatial products.”

A flood of satellite imagery is entering the commercial marketplace thanks to dozens of startups and established companies launching Earth imagery satellites. From forestry to construction, transportation and energy, companies are looking for ways to solve business and environmental problems with the help of geospatial data products and services.

UP42 draws on various data sources including high-resolution satellite and drone imagery and internet-of-things data. The company, established in Berlin earlier this year, has been testing its platform with partners since May.

In one of the projects conducted during Beta testing, Berlin startup LiveEO mapped German railway tracks and measured the height of nearby trees to assess the risk of trees falling onto the tracks.

In addition to relying on UP42’s existing algorithms, applications developers and data scientists will be able to upload their own processing algorithms to the platform.

UP42 offers agriculture customers tools to view farmland, identifying fields that require more water or fertilizer. The platform also includes tools designed to detect vehicles, including cars and ships, as well as structures like wind turbines and storage tanks.

An important job for geospatial data analysts is change detection. The UP42 platform includes tools to identify changes in comparable images.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999944806098938}",neutral,0.999944806098938,0
Airbus forecasts that number of planes in sky will double in 20 years - The Guardian,"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE5L3NlcC8xOC9haXJidXMtZm9yZWNhc3RzLTQ4MDAwLWFpcmNyYWZ0LXRvLWJlLWluLW9wZXJhdGlvbi1ieS0yMDM40gFraHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMTkvc2VwLzE4L2FpcmJ1cy1mb3JlY2FzdHMtNDgwMDAtYWlyY3JhZnQtdG8tYmUtaW4tb3BlcmF0aW9uLWJ5LTIwMzg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The number of commercial aircraft in operation will more than double in the next 20 years to 48,000 planes worldwide, Airbus has forecast.

The European aerospace company said that despite mounting concerns about the effects of aviation and the climate crisis, it believes air travel will continue to grow rapidly.

Urbanisation and development will mean the emerging global middle class of air passengers could rise 50% by 2038 to almost 6 billion people.

Most of the expected 4.3% annual growth in air traffic will occur in the Asia-Pacific region, where demand for new planes is set to surpass that of Europe and North America combined.

Airbus executives said aviation growth had proved resilient in the face of economic and geopolitical shocks, such as war and oil price rises, and they expected it to continue.

Last year, the growth in flying exceeded predictions, with the number of flights per year up by 280m. Christian Scherer, the chief commercial officer of Airbus, said: “It is as if every single inhabitant of the US took another trip.”

The manufacturer expects about 60% of the global fleet of 22,680 passenger jets and freight aircraft to be replaced with new planes in the next two decades, which it said would “contribute to progressive decarbonisation of the air transport industry”.

Asked if “flight-shaming” could affect Airbus’s forecasts, Scherer said: “It’s not a concern. We’d rather see it fundamentally as an opportunity. Airbus sees itself as a champion of bringing global emissions down and lowering fuel burn.”

While newer models of plane are far lighter and consume much less fuel, aviation’s overall carbon emissions have grown due to the huge rise in passenger numbers. Airbus said that on average, fuel consumption by distance per passenger is 47% of what it was in 1990. However, the number of annual passenger flights worldwide has quadrupled to 4 billion during that period.

The average aircraft has more seats and spends 2.3 more hours per day flying than 20 years ago - a trend that suggests even more air journeys could come from the 39,000 planes Airbus forecasts to be delivered by 2038.

Bob Lange, the senior vice-president for business analysis at Airbus, said its forecast had not been tempered for potential flying restrictions, whether through government action or public pressure. He said: “Greta Thunberg says, listen to the scientists and be equitable. The growth we see is from routes that are developing.”

Chinese domestic flights are due to triple and overtake US domestic flights as the biggest source of air traffic within the next two decades, according to the Airbus forecast. Indian people are expected to take five times as many flights as they do now by 2038.

Lange said: “As we become more globalised there are more reasons to travel. The growth is largely coming from people who haven’t accessed air travel in the past. If the US decide to halve their travel, it’s not going to make a dent in people travelling for the first time.

“In the notion of what we’re going to do to protect our planet there has to be a notion of equity.” He argued that it would be wrong to say other people shouldn’t aspire to travel as we do today.

Scherer said the goal of halving aviation’s emissions by 2050 was “not talk”, but targets Airbus uses as anchors. As yet, no technology appears to exist that is compatible with continued growth in flying.

Airbus is exploring sustainable fuels and alternative propulsion. It hopes to fly a test plane, the E-Fan X, in 2021, which could mean short-range hybrid-electric flights are feasible by the mid-2030s, Lange said. “We need to do more, it’s not enough but we can’t do it purely on our own.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8456259965896606}",neutral,0.8456259965896606,0
Emirates President Slams Airbus and Boeing for Lack of Reliability - Skift Travel News,"Wed, 04 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTkvMDkvMDQvZW1pcmF0ZXMtcHJlc2lkZW50LXNsYW1zLWFpcmJ1cy1hbmQtYm9laW5nLWZvci1sYWNrLW9mLXJlbGlhYmlsaXR5L9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTkvMDkvMDQvZW1pcmF0ZXMtcHJlc2lkZW50LXNsYW1zLWFpcmJ1cy1hbmQtYm9laW5nLWZvci1sYWNrLW9mLXJlbGlhYmlsaXR5L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Emirates President Tim Clark clearly had an agenda on Wednesday speaking with the media. He said he is tired of reliability challenges with new airplanes, and he wants suppliers to get their act together — quickly. Somebody had to say it.

Emirates President Tim Clark on Wednesday sharply criticized Boeing and Airbus along with engine suppliers Rolls-Royce and General Electric for failing to make reliable products, saying the companies may lose business as the global economy slows and airlines become more selective about which planes they will accept.

“I am a little bit irritated that, over the years, we as an airline, and I think as the industry, have been subjected to the requirements of the propulsion manufacturers, and to an extent the airframe manufacturers, where we are expected to deal with quality control issues and design issues, and operate these aircraft and engines, and take whatever consequences there are when they don’t work,” Clark said during a briefing in London, where he was attending the Aviation Festival. “We are not in a business to deal with aircraft that don’t function properly.”

Clark’s comments come as Emirates, its fleet long dominated by mammoth Airbus A380s, prepares for a future in which it flies more dual-engined jets and fewer four-engine superjumbos. Over the past six years, Emirates has placed orders for, or expressed serious interest in, the newest jets produced by Boeing and Airbus, such as the Airbus A350, Airbus 330neo, Boeing 777X and Boeing 787.

On Wednesday, however, Clark warned the manufacturers he won’t take any of the jets until Airbus and Boeing can deliver the reliability Emirates expects.

Safety is not an issue, Clark said, but Emirates cannot afford to keep pulling its most expensive assets from service because the airframe or engine needs repair. He said Emirates aims to achieve at least 99.5 percent reliability from its fleet, and expects to do little maintenance on an airplane for the first five years of its life.

“I’m not saying we don’t like the A330,” he said. “I’m not saying we won’t like the 787-9 and -10. I’m not saying we don’t like the A350. These are hugely potent aircraft that eventually will get all their operations sorted out. They are outstanding designs. Unfortunately they’re not being put together as well as they should be.”

GE and Rolls-Royce Complaints

In a wide-ranging discussion in a hotel conference room, Clark said Emirates will honor its purchase commitments, but said contracts protect the airline from accepting delivery of aircraft that do not hit specifications, for range, fuel burn and other metrics, that had been promised.

And he hinted Boeing is not close to providing what it has promised for the Boeing 777X. Emirates has ordered 150 of the next-generation jets, but Clark said he is concerned about General Electric’s engine design.

“The fact is, the Boeing 777X is delayed as a result of engine issues, and we are unsure as to when this is going to be resolved” Clark said. “I have been in this business longer than I like to remember, and I have seen airline and engine developments which are beset with problems. The airlines are now being required to deal with those, and work together with manufacturers to get them resolved. I say no. I say, ‘you give us airframes and engines that work from day one.’ If you can’t do it, don’t produce them.”

Clark said he has similar concerns with a top GE rival, Rolls-Royce, which makes engines for the A380, as well as other jets.

“There is no stability in the Rolls-Royce program at the moment as we see it,” Clark said.

After learning Clark’s comment, a Boeing spokesman said, “The safety and performance of our aircraft is our top priority. We are working closely with GE and Rolls-Royce as they resolve some challenges with their engines.”

An Airbus spokesman was not available for comment.

Reliability Troubles

Clark is far from the only airline executive to express dismay at the current state of airplane and engine manufacturing, though Clark’s comments may have been the sharpest. Before he retired in July, Norwegian Air CEO Bjorn Kjos also regularly publicly criticized Rolls-Royce, blaming it in part for the airline’s financial woes.

Worldwide, airlines have been forced to ground airplanes for extra inspections or to change engines sooner than expected because of problems with Rolls-Royce engines on Boeing 787s. British Airways and Norwegian have been forced to charter jets from other operators in order to fly the schedule they promised to consumers.

Clark said he wonders why airlines keep going to Airbus and Boeing headquarters to pick up airplanes that are not as reliable as promised. Clark noted the manufacturers won’t let Emirates take the airplane “if there is one cent missing from the final payment” yet airlines are often willing to accept a machine they know has problems.

He said Emirates will do not do so any longer.

“Is that not unreasonable?” he asked. “We have 615 people on 15 or 20 of these [A380] aircraft that we own flying around, and if an engine doesn’t work or a part fails, they are stranded at Heathrow or Frankfurt or Auckland. The consequential damage to us is huge because I have to get rid of 615 passengers. I have to disperse them on other carriers, which I have to pay. I have to pay the punitive damages that the Europeans or New Zealand is imposing on us under their consumer protection legislation.”

Clark said the engine manufacturers often tell airlines to take jets with safe but flawed engines, promising the airline they will improve them later. Clark said a car buyer would never accept a car that wasn’t perfect on Day 1, and questioned why airlines are willing to do it.

“[It’s like] if you bought a Rolls Royce or a BMW and Audi or a Mercedes and the dealer told you, ‘I have to work with you because I need to pull out a load of data — we’ll do it all for you — but I have to change your engine after three months and I need to plug in and get all the stuff uploaded as you’re driving to make sure the engine is doing what we think it’s going to do, but I have to have my 250,000 pounds now and then I’ll work with you to ensure that the engine works eventually according to what you wanted,'” Clark said. “That’s probably the best analogy.”

Choosier Going Forward

For decades, Emirates was on a growth binge, seeking to quickly add long-haul routes. In doing so, Clark said, the airline may not have been as careful as it could have been in evaluating quality.

“In the pursuit of getting the job done in the past, given the growth trajectory that Emirates imposed upon itself, given the tools that we needed … we had to accept levels of technical excellence well below where they were,” he said.

Clark said he expects global travel demand soon will slow, and as it does, he said he expects more airlines will adopt his attitude toward new aircraft.

“When they don’t give me airplanes and engines that work, it’s over,” he said. “Now you produce what you say you produce. When we are ready, we’ll take it.”

Airbus to develop technology for ultra-high-resolution satellites for UK MOD - Airbus,"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wOS1haXJidXMtdG8tZGV2ZWxvcC10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWZvci11bHRyYS1oaWdoLXJlc29sdXRpb24tc2F0ZWxsaXRlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"@AirbusSpace @dstlmod

London, 11 September 2019 – Airbus has won a design study from the UK’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) to develop the technologies for a cluster of ultra-high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites for the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD). The satellites will also have the ability to collect radio frequency (RF) signals.

Called “Oberon” the project will see Airbus develop the technologies that could lead to an in-orbit demonstration in 2022 and potentially an operational capability as early as 2025. The innovative techniques and technologies developed within the project will allow the ground to be seen in outstanding detail regardless of darkness, or of cloudy weather conditions.

Colin Paynter, Managing Director of Airbus Defence and Space UK said: “Project Oberon builds on Airbus’ expertise in space radar technology developed over 40 years. I look forward to seeing this study leading to a new world-class surveillance capability for the UK MOD, helping to protect our armed forces across the world.”

Gary Aitkenhead, Chief Executive of Dstl, said: “This addition to our capability is a valuable part of the future of Defence Space. Partnership between Dstl and Airbus on this project secures UK jobs as well as continuing to exploit advances in the UK space sector.”

Oberon follows the success of the SAR satellite, NovaSAR, designed and developed by Airbus and SSTL, which was launched in September 2018. Since NovaSAR was conceived, Dstl and Airbus have made significant leaps in technology, allowing the Oberon system to achieve high performance from a small and compact satellite system.

When U.S. team American Magic competes for sailing’s oldest trophy – the America’s Cup – in 2021, it will benefit from Airbus expertise across a broad range of related disciplines.

Representing the historic New York Yacht Club, American Magic enlisted Airbus to optimise the performance of its racing yacht design process – particularly looking to leverage the global company’s demonstrated excellence in engineering and simulation.

The ongoing Airbus-American Magic innovation partnership brings together two partners known for out-of-the-box thinking and concepts, now united to win the next edition of the nearly 170-year-old America’s Cup challenge. Further underscoring their compatibility, both teams also prioritise innovation and efficiency while maintaining the highest-possible safety levels.

A launch toward America’s Cup

Last weekend, American Magic launched their first full-scale, 75-ft. boat – named Defiant – in its preparations for the 2021 America’s Cup competition, largely relying performance results from a smaller 38-ft. prototype nicknamed “The Mule,” created with Airbus’ engineering support in several design areas.

“Congratulations to the team for this incredible hard work, which has given birth to this truly impressive boat!” said Jean-Brice Dumont, Executive Vice-President Engineering. “Airbus’ collaboration with American Magic is a true illustration of what passionate and innovative people can achieve together.”

Time is always a key factor in everything we do.

Airbus ground test engineer Laurent Chatillon

Defiant was constructed at a dedicated U.S. facility in Bristol, Rhode Island, with embedded Airbus engineers such as Toulouse, France-based Laurent Chatillon providing key assistance. “I’ve been involved with all of the boat’s systems, helping to design, size and test components to optimise their performance,” he explained. ""Time is always a key factor in everything we do.""

This race against time explains the importance of innovations such as virtual reality (VR). ""We provided the team with a VR set-up so they could enhance the design and installation of the electrical and hydraulic systems,"" explained Yves Le Biannic, who is overseeing Airbus' engineering efforts with American Magic. ""When Defiant arrived, we saved a significant amount of time because they already knew how to install the systems.""

Chatillon added that the run-up to Defiant’s launch was similar to that of an aircraft’s first flight, for which Airbus has a long history of successes. ""There was a lot of preparation and then pressure to execute and deliver on time,"" he continued. ""A teammate here said: 'You learn to be comfortable in uncomfortable situations. You do your best; you do what needs to be done and then you move on.'""

Heading for warmer waters

American Magic, including the embedded Airbus engineers, will continue to train in Rhode Island’s waters during the fall of 2019 before relocating to Pensacola, Florida for the winter. This is where preparations will begin for the first America’s Cup World Series Races, to be held next April in Cagliari, Sardinia, with Defiant later being succeeded by a further-refined AC75#2 version. The following America’s Cup race will commence in Auckland, New Zealand from February to March 2021.



Airbus’ involvement with the multi-stage competition is an outstanding opportunity to unleash the company’s pioneering spirit in an entirely new context. The partnership also reflects Airbus’ significant – and growing – presence in North America.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9981290698051453}",positive,0.9981290698051453,1

For Airbus Helicopters, investing in research is a means of promoting technological progress and helping build the future of vertical flight. Vehicular automation is one of the key issues for approaching future markets such as urban mobility, as well as for signi­ficantly increasing flight safety.

The RSAS, simple and e­ffective protection against obstacles

The RSAS (Rotor Strike Alerting System) alerts crew about collision risks to the main and rear rotors by indicating in which direction the nearest obstacle is. The alert is transmitted by an audible signal and a screen display, in the same way as equipment installed in cars. The RSAS uses two Lidar sensors (laser scanning) positioned on either side of the fuselage and covering 220° of the rear sector and sides of the helicopter. A third sensor will be optional for the front sector. The RSAS uses off-the-shelf detectors known for their robustness and lack of false alarms. The option to integrate RSAS will be proposed for the light aircraft range, from the H125 to the H145, which are those most used for near-the-ground aerial work. An STC is expected before the end of the year.

Eagle, at the service of urban mobility

Eagle is destined for further refinement in order to develop various technological components that will eventually enable the development of Airbus autonomous urban mobility systems. The first step, expected by 2021, is certification of the on-board computer that processes the images. Driven by new algorithms, the applications for which development has just been launched will also enable low-altitude navigation based on vision through cameras, automatic obstacle recognition, 3D reconstruction of landing zones, mobile obstacle tracking, etc.

Safety improvements

Operating near the ground, in hilly terrain, close to obstacles, and landing on oil rigs in all kinds of weather are just some of the complex missions in which the helicopter reigns supreme. In these cases, automation, sometimes inspired by cars, can contribute to safety improvements or even to the development of greater aircraft autonomy in sensitive flight phases.

Eagle eyes

While the RSAS is characterised by the rapid integration of off-the-shelf equipment, the Eagle system has another ambition entirely. This is an optronics system used to assist the crew in off shore operations by capturing the image of the heliport where the helicopter will land, from a distance of up to 2,000 m. The difficulties relate essentially to the shallow approach angle, which makes it diffi cult to capture a visual of the platform. The optronics must be able to see a long way while providing a very detailed image in which algorithms (developed with the assistance of imaging specialists from Airbus Defence & Space in Toulouse, France) will detect the platform and stabilise the image before displaying it on a screen. Eagle can also supply a higher mode of autopilot, leading to an automated approach, but always under the control of the crew. The first Eagle product will be available by 2021 and will be offered on a wide range of aircraft. It will make use of several fixed cameras offering different fields of vision. At the request of the crew, Eagle could also be used for automatic tracking of an opportunity zone other than the heliport, always with the same capacity to extract the area of interest from the image and ensure its automatic tracking.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9931638836860657}",neutral,0.9931638836860657,0
Largest harbours in the world rely on Airbus for Vessel Traffic Services - Airbus,"Wed, 04 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wOS1sYXJnZXN0LWhhcmJvdXJzLWluLXRoZS13b3JsZC1yZWx5LW9uLWFpcmJ1cy1mb3ItdmVzc2VsLXRyYWZmaWPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"@AirbusDefence #AirbusSecuritySolutions #maritime

Sydney, 04 September 2019 – Airbus has completed the upgrade of the Port of Sydney VTS (Vessel Traffic Services), through its maritime product family STYRIS®. Airbus’ maritime security and safety solution ensures the complete traffic monitoring of Sydney Habour and Port Botany, both managed by the Port Authority of New South Wales (Port Authority).

The recently completed upgrade of Sydney’s VTS to STYRIS® comes after the agreement signed in 2010, when Airbus was initially awarded the contract to supply the Sydney VTS system. In 2019, with this upgrade Airbus offers the Port Authority the latest VTS Product Generation of Airbus, providing an efficient way to manage the increasing vessel traffic while meeting updated local VTS regulations. Airbus has also extended the radar coverage of the Sydney VTS with the integration of a new radar site, located in Circular Quay, following the relocation of the former 115 metre high AMP Building radar to a new home in Darling Harbour.

With an offshore overview for pre-planning all vessel entries, the Airbus VTS system provides the Port Authority with real-time maritime information, helps organise port traffic, provide navigation assistance to vessels entering Sydney waters and ensures smooth operational conditions.

The Port of Sydney is arranged in two distinct areas: Port Jackson (commonly named Sydney Harbour), home to the famous and distinct Sydney Opera House and heritage-listed Sydney Harbour Bridge and Port Botany. While Port Botany plays a significant part in the trade handled through the Ports, Sydney Harbour also receives a large number of daily vessel movements, from small leisure boats to the largest passenger cruise ships, through the Passenger Terminals. In addition, there are large volumes of Sydney ferry services that form part of the city public transportation network with its hub is located in Circular Quay.

The Sydney waters with their high density of traffic represent a complex environment to manage for the Port Authority, whose focus is not only to drive the operational efficiency of Sydney Ports but also to ensure every movement is conducted safely for all who use the busy waterways.

Each year, the Port of Sydney becomes ever busier, with over 1,200 vessel visits in 2018 including 350 cruise ships, some of which can carry up to 5,000 passengers plus crew, and 1.6 million passengers passing through Port Authority terminals.

The VTS system is a major component of Sydney waters operational safety management and especially in the monitoring of key events such as the popular Sydney New Year’s Eve Midnight Fireworks, the Australia Day Regatta and the annual 630 nautical mile (1,170 km) Rolex Sydney Hobart Yacht Race.

Philip Holliday, Chief Operating Officer and Habour Master Sydney at Port Authority of New South Wales (Port Authority), said: “Managing this port is a particular challenge, especially taking into account the high density of maritime traffic, which is very diverse in nature. Airbus brings state of the art maritime vessel traffic services to support responses to the many and varied scenarios that may arise: From the standard monitoring of the maritime traffic to specific requirements for enhanced reponse capability during unexpected situations.”

“The longstanding and successful partnership in Australia between Airbus and the Port Authority continues with a new chapter: the upgrade of the Sydney VTS. Since 2010, Airbus has monitored the traffic of Australia’s main harbours. I’m proud that we can support the harbour authorities in their day to day challenges to make the Australian ports safer and protect people's ways of life,” said Evert Dudok, Head of Communications, Intelligence and Security at Airbus.

Airbus commences in-flight trials of connected cabin technologies - Airbus,"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wOS1haXJidXMtY29tbWVuY2VzLWluLWZsaWdodC10cmlhbHMtb2YtY29ubmVjdGVkLWNhYmluLXRlY2hub2xvZ2llc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airspace Connected Experience: Pioneering Internet of Things in the aircraft cabin

Pioneering Internet of Things in the aircraft cabin Paving the way for a new personalised passenger experience and an open ecosystem approach for airlines

Airbus has commenced in-flight trials of IoT* connected cabin technologies on board an A350-900 Flight Lab aircraft – to be shortly revealed to customers. In doing so, Airbus becomes the first aircraft manufacturer to undertake such flight-testing of actual connected cabin innovations. The platform, known as the Airspace Connected Experience, was unveiled at APEX Expo last year. It will usher in a new personalised experience for passengers and provide opportunities for improving airlines’ ancillary revenues and operational efficiencies.

The Flight Lab is one of the original A350-900 certification flight-test aircraft – MSN002 – and is fitted with an Airspace cabin which now serves as the ideal platform to evaluate the new connected cabin technologies in flight. To this end, and in conjunction with Airbus’ best-in-class cabin partners, an initial set of working elements have been installed. These include prototypes of the connected iSeat (Recaro), the Connected Galley (gategroup), a remote wireless cabin management control system, a large OLED display and importantly, the first step of Airbus’ new “IoT backbone” which includes an open software platform. These innovations are all now being tested in flight – together with others to be revealed in due course to customers.

The connected cabin ecosystem will enable significant value-adding services for passengers, airlines and crews. Possible examples include:

Passengers will receive a more personalised travel experience specifically targeted to the individual needs and preferences, based on the available data. In particular this covers pre- and remote ordering of preferred meals, booking of private bin space, setting of individual seat positions as well as a tailor-made inflight IFE offer.

Airlines will be able to generate additional ancillary revenues through personalised retail and advertisement as well as new services, all enabled by the IoT approach. Furthermore, airlines will be able to improve their operational efficiency applying predictive maintenance, avoiding waste and making crew services more efficient. Other opportunities can easily be created and applied via apps.

Furthermore, airlines will be able to improve their operational efficiency applying predictive maintenance, avoiding waste and making crew services more efficient. Other opportunities can easily be created and applied via apps. Crews will find a better working environment and more efficient tools, digitally enabled by real-time data from the IoT platform throughout the cabin. A mobile smart device will allow crews to monitor and operate all components.

Customer-centric approach

The in-flight tests are part of our customer-centric approach, which began with workshops to create and prioritise innovative concepts, followed by an extensive phase of on-ground testing and customer evaluation of the connected elements. The subsequent testing of these innovations in an Airbus Flight Lab environment is key to bringing an integrated Connected Experience to fruition – being able to validate and refine them in a real airborne cabin. In particular, the tests allow the various elements to be operated and monitored during a normal flight cycle, especially with regard to the end-to-end data flow robustness within the systems and between them. The next steps will continue testing of the current setup, then close the feedback loop with airlines using Airbus’ Customer Experience Teams (CET) forum, by around year-end.

Airbus and Boeing Report August 2019 Commercial Aircraft Orders and Deliveries - Defense & Security Monitor,"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL2RzbS5mb3JlY2FzdGludGVybmF0aW9uYWwuY29tLzIwMTkvMDkvMTcvYWlyYnVzLWFuZC1ib2VpbmctcmVwb3J0LWF1Z3VzdC0yMDE5LWNvbW1lcmNpYWwtYWlyY3JhZnQtb3JkZXJzLWFuZC1kZWxpdmVyaWVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Both Companies Report Weak Orders & Deliveries – 737 MAX Technical Review to Release Observations, Findings, and Recommendations Soon.

by J. Kasper Oestergaard, European Correspondent, Forecast International.

Boeing and Airbus delivered 18 and 42 commercial jets in August 2019, compared to 64 and 54 deliveries, respectively, in the same month last year. Airbus gave no explanation as to why its deliveries dropped substantially in August. With just 276 deliveries this year to date, Boeing is 205 shipments behind last year’s total for the first eight months of the year. Airbus delivered a total of 500 jets from January to August, compared to 434 during the same period last year. Boeing’s deliveries have taken a severe hit since the March 10 crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, a 737 MAX, and the subsequent deliveries halt and grounding of the fleet. Boeing decided on March 14 to suspend all deliveries of 737 MAX jets. The crashes were with a high degree of certainty caused by the aircraft’s Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which suddenly activated in response to erroneous angle of attack information. In 2018, Boeing delivered 806 jets (763 in 2017), with Airbus handing over 800 (718 in 2017).

In August, Boeing delivered a single 737 NG. Boeing is still producing 737 MAX jets at a reduced rate of 42 aircraft per month and thereby building up an inventory of aircraft ready to be shipped. During 2018, Boeing raised its 737 production rate to 52 and was planning a further increase to 57 per month from June of this year. Producing the 737 MAX at a reduced rate will allow the company to prioritize additional resources to focus on returning the 737 MAX to flight.

In April, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) established a Boeing 737 MAX Joint Authorities Technical Review (JATR) comprising a team of experts from the FAA, NASA, and international aviation authorities. Since then, Boeing has worked with the FAA, and the JATR and has tested updates to its 737 MAX software during hundreds of flights. On August 5, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg announced that the company has conducted almost 500 737 MAX test flights with updated software. According to the Associated Press, Boeing is currently working on new software for the 737 MAX that will use a second flight control computer to make the system more reliable. On August 30, the FAA announced that the JATR is taking additional time to finish documenting its work. The panel is expected to submit its observations, findings, and recommendations in the coming weeks.

In early September, Muilenburg announced that the 737 MAX could be brought back into service gradually by government regulators and that the aircraft is still on track to be cleared to fly again in 2019. Exactly when the 737 MAX will return to service remains unclear, however. Boeing’s best estimate is that the jet could be approved “early in the fourth quarter.” The largest operator of the grounded jet, Southwest Airlines, has canceled all 737 MAX flights through early January. In total, Boeing has delivered 387 737 MAX jets to date. A total of 256 737 MAX jets were delivered in 2018, up from 74 in 2017. In August, Boeing also delivered three 767s, three 777s and 11 787s. Boeing recently raised the monthly Dreamliner production rate to 14 aircraft. Boeing has handed over 101 787s year-to-date. The company delivered 145 787s in 2018, up from 136 in 2017. In connection with Boeing’s second quarter 2019 earnings report, Muilenburg announced that Boeing plans to increase 777F production due to 777X delays, but did not disclose by how much.

In August, Airbus delivered three A220s, 28 A320s (9 CEO / 19 NEO), six A330s, and five A350s. Later this year, Airbus expects to increase the A320 production rate to 60 aircraft per month. Furthermore, the company is targeting a raise to 63 jets per month from 2021. A total of 386 A320neo family aircraft were delivered in 2018, up from 181 and 68 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Airbus has shipped off 65 A350s year-to-date, having delivered 93 A350s in 2018, up from 78 in 2017, and recently increased the monthly production rate to 10. Airbus is considering a further increase to 13 A350s per month, but a date has yet to be announced. With the ramp-up of A350 XWB deliveries combined with a higher A320 production rate, Airbus has nearly eliminated Boeing’s deliveries lead in recent years. Following the tragic 737 MAX events, Airbus is now almost certain to deliver more aircraft in 2019 than Boeing.

Turning to the orders race, Boeing had a very quiet month in August, logging just six gross orders, all for 777 and 787 widebody jets (three cancellations => net of three). Boeing’s August bookings included three 777Fs for China Airlines, two 787-9s for a business jet / VIP customer, and one 777-200LR for Turkmenistan Airlines. Year-to-date, Boeing has accumulated 145 gross orders (230 cancellations => -85 net new orders). For full-year 2018, Boeing booked 893 net new orders (1,008 gross orders).

Airbus also had a quiet month and booked just 16 gross orders, but reported no cancellations. In August, an undisclosed customer ordered 15 A321XLRneos and a private customer ordered a single ACJ320neo. For 2019 to date, Airbus reports 262 gross orders (167 cancellations => net of 95). Of these cancellations, 31 were due to Emirates’ decision earlier this year to reduce its A380 order book. This subsequently forced Airbus to announce that it will cease A380 production in 2021. In 2018, Airbus landed a total of 747 net new orders (831 gross orders), thereby losing the 2018 orders race as Boeing had accumulated 893 net new orders. Airbus had retained an orders lead over its rival every year since 2012.

On August 31, 2019, Airbus’ backlog was 7,172 jets, of which 6,238, or 87 percent, are A220 and A320ceo/neo family narrowbodies. The company’s all-time backlog record high of 7,577 jets was set in December 2018. By the end of August 2019, Boeing’s backlog (total unfilled orders after ASC 606 adjustments) was 5,730 aircraft, of which 4,595, or 80 percent, are 737 NG/MAX narrowbody jets. Boeing’s all-time backlog high of 5,964 aircraft was set in August 2018. The number of Airbus aircraft to be built and delivered represents 9.0 years of shipments at the 2018 production level. In comparison, Boeing’s backlog would “only” last 7.1 years. This year to date, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio, calculated as orders divided by deliveries, is negative. Airbus’ book-to-bill ratio is 0.19. In 2018, Boeing boasted a book-to-bill ratio of 1.11, with Airbus at 0.93. In 2017, Boeing booked 912 net new orders for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.20. That same year, Airbus booked 1,109 net new orders, for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.54.

2019 Forecast

Forecast International’s Platinum Forecast System® is a breakthrough in forecasting technology. Among many other features, Platinum provides 15-year production forecasts. The author has used the Platinum Forecast System to retrieve the latest delivery forecasts and, for 2019, Forecast International’s analysts expect Boeing and Airbus to deliver 724 and 875 large commercial jets, respectively. The 2019 forecast for Boeing was 904 prior to the second 737 MAX crash and the subsequent grounding of the fleet and temporary cut in the production rate. These are the latest “live” forecast figures (adjusted frequently by FI analysts as new information comes in). These figures exclude militarized variants of commercial platforms such as Boeing’s P-8 Poseidon, KC-46 and KC-767 tankers, and C-40; and Airbus’ A330 MRTT tanker.

Prior to the second 737 MAX crash, Boeing announced, in connection with the release of its 2018 earnings report in late January, that it was targeting between 895 and 905 commercial jet deliveries in 2019, a 12-13 percent increase from 2018. Boeing has yet to announce a revised figure and is likely awaiting the 737 MAX’s return to service before providing updated guidance. On February 14, Airbus announced that it is aiming for 880 to 890 commercial aircraft deliveries in 2019, equal to a 10-11 percent increase from 2018.

Note: Boeing 777-300ER orders include one 777-200LR. The 777-300ER backlog includes two 777-200LRs.

This is the first time a twin-engine helicopter has landed at this altitude, confirming the performance and the extensive flight envelope of the new H145.

The conditions for this mission were extreme, due to the atmospheric conditions in the area and the winter season. The aircraft took off from Mendoza, Argentina, flew 30 minutes to the foot of the Aconcagua where it began its ascension. After 15 minutes of climbing, the helicopter landed at 1.45 pm on the summit, at a temperature of -22ºC. The crew onboard the helicopter consisted of Alexander Neuhaus, experimental test pilot and Antoine van Gent, experimental flight test engineer.

“We had to stay focused on the mission due to severe winds with gusts up to 30 knots and the low air density. The handling qualities of the new H145 are excellent and combined with Helionix and its 4 axis-autopilot, we reached the summit safely,” said Alexander Neuhaus, experimental test pilot at Airbus Helicopters. “The aircraft performed outstandingly. We flew over the summit of the Aconcagua and still had power reserves that would have allowed us take two people on-board.”

The flight test was supported by the Fuerza Aerea Argentina, who provided aerial support with their Lama helicopters; Patrulla de Rescate de Alta Montaña de Policia de Mendoza, who assisted with a contingency plan; Parque Provincial Aconcagua, facilitating operations and logistics, and Helicopters AR, a local operator with over 15 years of experience flying in the Aconcagua area with their Airbus H125 helicopter.

This is not the first mountain Airbus Helicopters has mastered. On 14 May 2005, the flight test pilot Didier Delsalle landed a single-engine H125 on Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world.

Prior to the successful high altitude test campaign in South America, the new H145 performed several test campaigns including in Spain at medium altitudes and Finland for cold weather. In total, more than 400 flight hours have already been clocked on the two five-bladed H145 prototypes to ensure EASA certification by early 2020, followed by FAA certification and first deliveries later that year.

The new version of its best-selling H145 light twin-engine helicopter was unveiled at Heli-Expo 2019 in Atlanta in March. This latest upgrade adds a new, innovative five-bladed rotor to the multi-mission H145, increasing the useful load of the helicopter by 150 kg. The simplicity of the new bearingless main rotor design will also ease maintenance operations, further improving the benchmark serviceability and reliability of the H145, while improving ride comfort for both passengers and crew.

Airbus and Telespazio join forces to sell military telecommunications services on Syracuse IV satellites - Airbus,"Mon, 09 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wOS1haXJidXMtYW5kLXRlbGVzcGF6aW8tam9pbi1mb3JjZXMtdG8tc2VsbC1taWxpdGFyedIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris, 9 September 2019 – Airbus and Telespazio (Leonardo/Thales) have set up a partnership to market military telecommunications services using the future Syracuse IV satellites.

This partnership will lead to the creation of France’s leading private operator of military satellite telecommunications. It demonstrates the desire for cooperation by European industrial prime contractors Airbus, Thales and Leonardo, as well as the French State, in marketing Syracuse IV satellite capacity for the benefit of armed and security forces in Europe and around the world.

The French Defence Procurement Agency (DGA), Airbus, Thales Alenia Space and Telespazio have put together an innovative financing initiative, enabling any excess satellite capacity to be sold to third-party customers, thereby bringing down the total cost of ownership of the Syracuse IV system. These sales contracts, scheduled for a 10-year period, will enable allied countries or organisations to be offered simple, flexible and reactive access to a strategic resource, thus strengthening France’s international cooperation arrangements in the field of defence and security.

With this partnership, Airbus and Telespazio will be able to sell Syracuse IV satellite capacity and various high-added-value services such as anchor capacity (connection of satellite communications to the ground networks of third-party customers), end-to-end services with capacity and throughput guarantees, engineering and maintenance services.

These services will be accessible over a broad area ranging from French Guiana to the Straits of Malacca and will be deployed for maritime, terrestrial and air uses. Allied forces will thus have access to communication capacity in X-band, military Ka-band and X/Ka dual-band mode, offering unique flexibility while benefiting from the highest levels of protection and hardening provided for in the NATO standards. Their units deployed in the field will be able to exchange video, voice and data via all-IP (Internet Protocol) communications at rates of up to several hundred Mbit/s.

“Airbus is capitalising on the unique experience of satellite services for the armed forces to enhance its range with a system equipped with the most advanced space and terrestrial telecommunication technologies,” said Eric Souleres, Head of Communications, Intelligence & Security Engineering at Airbus Defence and Space.

“Building on its expertise in the field, Telespazio is proud to consolidate its role as a trusted operator of French military telecommunications satellites and contribute to an innovative operation which will round out its world-class range of government capacity services,” said Jean-Marc Gardin, CEO of Telespazio France and Deputy CEO of the Telespazio Group.

Syracuse IV is a telecommunication system consisting of two military satellites, Syracuse 4A and 4B, plus ground stations to ensure communications in the operational areas and with mainland France. These two 3.5-tonne class, electric-propulsion geostationary satellites are being built by an industrial group consisting of Thales Alenia Space and Airbus, with launch planned for 2022. They will be supplemented in around 2030 by a third satellite in order to meet growing needs, in particular the specific needs of air vehicles (aircraft, UAVs). These new-generation satellites will be the first to offer a completely flexible reconfiguration of the X‑ and Ka-band military payload as well as the means of protection and hardening against cyber, jamming, intercept and EMP-type threats.

"Airbus touts Airspace, Internet of Things at APEX convention - Leeham News and Analysis","Fri, 13 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxOS8wOS8xMy9haXJidXMtdG91dHMtYWlyc3BhY2UtaW50ZXJuZXQtb2YtdGhpbmdzLWF0LWFwZXgtY29udmVudGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sept. 13, 2019, © Leeham News, Los Angeles: Airbus is expanding its Airspace interior look to the A321LR and A321XLR, providing a common theme with its widebody A330neo and A350 family members.

The OEM is also launching the fully cabin-connected Internet of Things (IoT), a system connecting just about everything in a cabin, for passenger experience and airline use.

The moves were revealed at the 2019 APEX convention last week in Los Angeles.

Airspace

Airspace is the modern cabin look and passenger experience created for the A350 and A330neo. With the A321neo’s ability to now perform flights up to eight or nine hours, the experience is migrating to the single-aisle airplane.

Mood lighting and larger bins are intended to enhance the passenger experience on the new long-haul A321 flights.

Internet of Things

The IoT connection, which is now in flight testing on the Airbus A350 MSN002 house aircraft, connects lighting, overhead bins, windows, cabin air, seats, galleys, in-flight entertainment and even the lavs into a single system.

IoT will allow passengers to tell which lav is occupied, something not of particular use on a single-aisle A321 where lav occupied signs are easily seen from the cabin.

But on twin-aisle airplanes, a camera will be able to discern how long a line is waiting for a lav that may not be visible from one side of the cabin.

Or, as an Airbus spokesperson joked to a recalcitrant journalist who questioned the value of this, “If you mess the lav, we’ll know it was you.”

From an airline’s perspective, the IoT will allow ground crews to know if there is a fix needed to some component or feature in advance of the next stop.

Flight attendants will be able to easily check if seat belts are fastened and if tray tables and seat backs are up.

Perhaps more ominously for passengers, Airbus touts another fee-inducing feature for airline ancillary revenue and a money-grab from passengers: reserving overhead bin space. Airbus touts the ability of passengers to book overhead bin space in advance.

Embraer delivers new jet that Boeing may soon sell against Airbus - Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9lbWJyYWVyLWRlbGl2ZXJzLWpldC1ib2VpbmctbWF5LTE4MjYwMTY3NS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Marcelo Rochabrun

SAO JOSE DOS CAMPOS, Brazil (Reuters) - Embraer <EMBR3.SA> hopes to see more orders for its newest passenger plane by the end of the year, an executive said on Thursday, as Boeing <BA.N> readies to take over the Brazilian planemaker's commercial jets division in what could mark the next phase of its rivalry with Airbus <AIR.PA>.

Manufacture of the E195-E2, as Embraer's plane is known, will soon be controlled by Boeing, which needs regulatory approval to close on the deal to buy 80% of Embraer's commercial jets division for $4.2 billion.

Embraer on Thursday delivered its first E195-E2 plane, which will seat about 140, to Brazil's No. 3 airline Azul <AZUL.N> at its headquarters in Sao Paulo state. Embraer executives said the delivery should spur more orders, helping to fend off fresh competition from Airbus.

""I expect we will close more transactions, I'm hopeful ... before the end of the year,"" John Slattery, head of Embraer's commercial plane division, told Reuters. ""I'm not seeing a big wave of people that need to delay, or wish to delay because of the Boeing transaction.""

The new plane comes as the landscape for jets with under 150 seats is changing drastically. Airbus bought control of the Bombardier <BBDb.TO> division competing directly with Embraer in 2018, followed by Boeing's deal to take over Embraer's commercial plane division.

The result would expand the global duopoly for jumbo jets into a smaller category, as Boeing and Airbus work to lure orders across a broader lineup of commercial aircraft.

Azul was founded by U.S. airline executive David Neeleman, who also founded JetBlue Airways <JBLU.O>, which was a launch customer and key customer for Embraer's last generation of jets.

""We can have 18 more seats with this plane, with a travel cost that is 15% less,"" Neeleman said of the improvements in the new generation. ""If you have something that is 15% cheaper, you just want that thing, you don't want anything else.""

Story continues

STIFF COMPETITION

Embraer is banking on the fuel efficiency of this new generation, to the point it has marketed its E195-E2 to customers as the ""profit hunter,"" painting the jet with livery resembling a shark in the plane's nose.

But for now, Embraer has struggled to compete directly with Airbus. Carriers and plane lessors had placed 551 orders for the Airbus A220 family as of June, but Embraer had racked up only 168 for its new family of E2 jets, down from 200 in 2014.

Part of Embraer's struggles stem from its smaller E175-E2 plane, which has been a hard sell to U.S. regional airlines due to labor contract restrictions. Embraer dropped 100 of those planes from its order book after resistance from pilots made it unclear if buyer Skywest <SKYW.O> would be able to fly them.

""We didn't design an aircraft just for the U.S. market,"" Slattery said, adding that he hopes his company will secure an order from a customer somewhere else in the world this year. Currently they have none, although Slattery said Skywest remains committed, if pilots allow it.

JetBlue also dealt a blow to Embraer last year when it decided to replace its old Embraer fleet with Airbus A220s, a decade after Neeleman left the company.

JetBlue cited the advantages of A220's longer range, as well as a broader package with Airbus including larger planes — the kind of arrangement that Boeing could offer with Embraer's jets in its portfolio.

New Airbus planes will track when you go to the bathroom - New York Post,"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDE5LzA5LzE2L25ldy1haXJidXMtcGxhbmVzLXdpbGwtdHJhY2std2hlbi15b3UtZ28tdG8tdGhlLWJhdGhyb29tL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The connected home is a pretty mainstream phenomenon at this point, as more and more consumers bring products like smart speakers and displays, connected video doorbells, smart appliances and the like into their lives, making ubiquitous connectivity and digitization an even more commonplace part of everyday existence. And now, thanks to aerospace giants like Airbus, it seems the friendly skies are the next target for the spread of the so-called Internet of Things.

Through the end of this year, Airbus will be hosting test flights of its A350-900 aircraft that have been specially kitted with sensors that will monitor passengers extremely closely — even in the bathroom — all in the name of delivering better and more personalized service.

It’s like a giant digital monitoring hub, and according to a company press release, Airbus’ “Connected Experience” will give crew members a plethora of data and metrics they didn’t have before. Tracking passenger bathroom habits, for example, certainly has a dystopian hint about it, but Airbus is doing that to give the crew more insight into things like when the soap dispenser is low and whether the bathroom is about to run out of toilet paper.

Sensors on the plane will track everything from meal trolleys to passenger seats, overhead bins and other elements of the plane cabin. All that data would then be uploaded to Airbus’ Skywise system (which, yes, is just one syllable away from Skynet) for what Airbus says is “subsequent trend analysis.” To get a sense of the granular level of detail that will apparently be available to Airbus, there will also be sensors in seat armrests, tray tables and on the seatback. Sensors in the overhead bins, according to the aircraft manufacturer, could eventually be used to better indicate free space (facilitating a faster load-in) as well as better space management — perhaps even allowing passengers to book a specific bin space in the future.

Said Ingo Wuggetzer, Airbus’ vice president of cabin marketing, at a trade show in Los Angeles in recent days, by way of touting the scope of what Airbus is attempting to do here: “It’s not a concept. It’s not a dream. It’s reality.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999687910079956}",neutral,0.999687910079956,0
Trump Cleared to Put More Tariffs on Europe in Airbus Case (Published 2019) - The New York Times,"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTkvMDkvMTYvYnVzaW5lc3MvZWNvbm9teS93dG8tYWlyYnVzLXRhcmlmZnMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — The World Trade Organization will grant the United States permission to impose tariffs on the European Union as part of a prolonged scuffle over subsidies given to European plane maker Airbus, European officials said Monday, a move that is likely to exacerbate trade tensions across the Atlantic.

The ruling, to be published in the week of Sept. 30, is the global trade body’s final decision in a 15-year old dispute over the government assistance that Europe provides to its major plane manufacturer. It will clear the way for the United States to impose tariffs on European goods, worsening tensions that have become strained under President Trump’s confrontational approach.

The W.T.O. still must authorize a specific dollar amount that the United States can recoup through tariffs. But the United States Trade Representative has already prepared two lists of up to $25 billion worth of products that it can tax, including airplanes, fish, wine, leather purses, carpets and clocks.

The trade body opened the door for the Trump administration to impose billions of dollars in retaliatory sanctions last May, when it ruled that Europe had illegally subsidized Airbus to the detriment of its American competitor Boeing.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9969459176063538}",neutral,0.9969459176063538,0
"Airbus teases new business, premium seats for longhaul narrowbodies - Runway Girl Network","Wed, 11 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTkvMDkvYWlyYnVzLXRlYXNlcy1uZXctYnVzaW5lc3MtcHJlbWl1bS1zZWF0cy1mb3ItbG9uZ2hhdWwtbmFycm93Ym9kaWVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With the sales success of the ten-hour-capable A321XLR since its announcement at the Paris Air Show this June, and in the context of production problems with its Cabin Flex door redistribution A321neo models, Airbus is redoubling its efforts to ensure that the passenger experience on board matches that of the widebody competition.

With class-leading economy class seats like the Recaro CL3710 already offered in narrowbodies, key questions for airframers are around expanding the narrowbody flat bed business class option list beyond the current choice of “Vantage or Diamond”. Those Thompson Aero Seating and Collins Aerospace products are, by and large, the common choice of many airlines on the A320 family airframes, from JetBlue to Qatar to Aer Lingus to La Compagnie to TAP and beyond.

For the A321neo’s extended range versions, “Suppliers are really working on new products that will be available in time for those deliveries,” Airbus vice president of cabin marketing Ingo Wuggetzer tells Runway Girl Network. “Clearly we push for innovative products for single-aisle, but always take care that you can use them as well on widebodies. We see some things coming up on the market.”

Of course, some airlines choosing between the Vantage or Diamond binary have moved beyond those products for their longhaul aircraft, whether that’s TAP or Qatar.

There will be, Wuggetzer suggests, “a range that you have today on widebody, that will be more high-end full comfortable seats, and there will be more efficient ones. That depends where you position your airline and yourself.”

Part of the complexity is around the growing customization of business class, which is by and large Buyer Furnished Equipment (BFE), selected and customized by the airline purchasing the aircraft. Airlines, it seems, still want a unique product and so are more willing to take on the effort of designing, customizing and certifying it.

There remains, however, “a commodity area which you also offer as supplier furnished equipment — or something in between — because it’s ‘same-same but different’,” Wuggetzer says. “It’s more about the integration, the functionality, the weight and things like that because the product itself is kind of a standard. That’s why the new innovative parts could be driven by airlines, in the premium area.”

But Airbus has, Wuggetzer says, “an interest to find partners that develop products that really make use of our advantages that we have in single-aisle, because we have more space in the wider cross-section.”

In essence this is the showroom question: Airbus needs to have enough options to give airlines ideas about how they might be able to either create a bespoke product, highly customize a seat, or change just enough of the color, materials and finish to make it match their brand, depending on the nature of the airline and the depths of its pockets.

But there is change coming, Wuggetzer says. “I think this will get more speed. They’re working on several concepts. I saw something coming up that’s in the pipeline. As soon as the airlines’ demand is growing, it will happen, especially if you can use the same seats for widebodies. I am quite positive, to be honest. What I see on the horizon coming up [will] offer enough variety and choice.”

Further back, too, there is an interesting tension between two trends. On the one hand, the pendulum is swinging strongly towards premium economy, with recent new and refurbished aircraft LOPAs featuring a growing number and proportion of these seats, which remain the most profitable on most aircraft by area.

Widebody-style recliners, he says, “could be one of the solutions to the three or four classes. You can’t predict it, but it’s one possibility, I would say, yes. It’s translating the same as we saw on widebody, coming to the single aisle.”

In the wider context, “there’s a hardware differentiation, a pitch differentiation but there also might be a service differentiation. There are a couple of grey zones between classes to make it not such a hard line. You see it also in Europe: you can upgrade services but not hardware or the other way around. What airlines try to do is to offer a variety and a bigger, broader choice level mixing different things.”

The longhaul passenger experience question for airlines, airframers and suppliers, Wuggetzer asks, is clear: “What does it mean translated into a single-aisle?”

The European planemaker Airbus upped its estimate for the number of new aircraft needed over the next 20 years, while at the same time lowering its prediction for the number of planes that will serve the skies.

In its annual global market outlook released Wednesday, Airbus predicted that the world will need 47,680 jets by 2038 — a slight reduction on last year's estimate out to 2037. At present, there are around 23,000 jets globally.

The firm said while fewer planes will be required, more will need to be sold as airlines update fleets with more fuel-efficient models. Airbus breaks down the 2038 total to 39,210 new planes and 8,470 remaining from today. Seems to be 9 left over

The outlook also forecast that around two-thirds of new plane deliveries will be needed to satisfy a doubling of passenger traffic over the next 15 years. The remainder (36%) will be sold to replace current jets.

Airbus sees single-aisle jet demand rising 4% to 29,720 planes, but cut its medium-sized plane forecast to 5,370.

Within its large plane segment, Airbus predicts 4,120 new planes sold but no longer includes a separate forecast for Boeing's ageing 747 or the recently halted Airbus A380.

The Airbus projection offered no dollar value for the new business. On Tuesday, rival Boeing released its commercial outlook projecting $6.8 trillion worth of airplane sales by 2038 with a further $9.1 trillion in services.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9946867227554321}",neutral,0.9946867227554321,0

This is because the European and American supply chains are so interwoven.

""At Airbus, 40 percent of commercial aircraft procurement is purchased from the U.S. supply chain,"" Faury told POLITICO. ""I think it would really not be consistent to apply tariffs on planes that are manufactured in the U.S., to serve the U.S. industry relying, to a very large extent, on the U.S. supply chain. It will be damaging for the supply chain, it will be damaging for the OEMs [original equipment manufacturers], and it will be very damaging for the airlines and for the economies of Europe and the U.S.""

The EU expects the WTO to issue its decision on subsidies to Boeing early next year and has readied a list of U.S. goods to hit with tariffs.

Many American airlines have Airbus aircraft on order, Faury stressed. Those planes contain U.S. parts and are assembled at a plant in Mobile, Alabama.

""We are assembling our A320s as well in Mobile so this will impact as well the workforce in the U.S., which would be absolutely not consistent with what President Trump is trying to push: having companies localizing activities in the U.S.""

The interview with Faury took place on Friday in Berlin, a day before POLITICO reported the WTO had submitted its report allowing the U.S. to impose tariffs on European products.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9933896064758301}",negative,0.9933896064758301,-1

Friedrichshafen, 03 September 2019 – Airbus has completed the ocean satellite ‘Copernicus Sentinel-6A’, and is now sending it on its first journey. Its destination: Ottobrunn near Munich in Germany, where over the next six months the satellite will undergo an extensive series of tests at Industrieanlagen Betriebsgesellschaft mbH (IABG) to prove its readiness for space.

‘Copernicus Sentinel-6’ will carry out high-precision measurements of ocean surface topography. The satellite will measure its distance to the ocean surface with an accuracy of a few centimetres and, over a mission lasting up to seven years, use this data to map it, repeating the cycle every 10 days. It will document changes in sea-surface height, record and analyse variations in sea levels and observe ocean currents. Exact observations of changes in sea-surface height provide insights into global sea levels, the speed and direction of ocean currents, and ocean heat storage. These measurements are vital for modelling the oceans and predicting rises in sea levels.

The findings will enable governments and institutions to establish effective protection for coastal regions. The data will be invaluable not only for disaster relief organisations, but also for authorities involved in urban planning, securing buildings or commissioning dykes.

Global sea levels are currently rising by an average of 3.3 millimetres a year as a result of global warming; this could potentially have dramatic consequences for countries with densely populated coastal areas.

Two Sentinel-6 satellites for the European Copernicus Programme for environment and security are currently being developed under Airbus’s industrial leadership. While it is one of the European Union’s family of Copernicus satellite missions, Sentinel-6 is also being realised thanks to an international cooperation between ESA, NASA, NOAA and Eumetsat.

Each satellite weighs approximately 1.5 tonnes. From November 2020, Sentinel-6A will be the first of the two Sentinel-6 satellites to continue collecting satellite-based measurements of the oceans’ surfaces, a task that began in 1992. Sentinel-6B is then expected to follow in 2025.

New Airbus battery lab to push battery technology in Shenzhen - Airbus,"Fri, 20 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE5LTA5LW5ldy1haXJidXMtYmF0dGVyeS1sYWItdG8tcHVzaC1iYXR0ZXJ5LXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktaW4tc2hlbnpoZW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"From mobile phones to electric cars, batteries have transformed our lives. Yet much of their potential remains untapped. In China, the recently opened Airbus China Innovation Centre battery lab is looking to unleash this potential to power a new generation of electric-powered aerial vehicles.

For anyone who has ever used a mobile phone or laptop computer, there is no doubt batteries have transformed our lives. And thanks to major technology advancements in recent years, today’s batteries are smaller and more powerful than ever before, which continues to broaden their use.

Lithium-ion batteries—the most cutting-edge and widely used battery technology in the world—have become 5-10% more efficient each year since their introduction in the 1970s. This has helped to spur the mass adoption of portable electronic devices, and is turning the dream of affordable electric vehicles (EVs) into reality. According to recent estimates, EVs are expected to account for almost a third of global car sales by 2025. As a result, the global demand for lithium-ion batteries has exploded, growing more than 700% since 2010.

Better batteries will help to enable tomorrow’s aerial vehicles. New urban air vehicles, as seen in the case of Vahana and CityAirbus, will require batteries that are not only extremely light and powerful, but also reliable and cost efficient.

- Mustang Guo, ACIC Project Manager

Today, Asia is the global epicentre of battery development and production, with Japan and Korea as the worldwide leaders. However, a new player is rapidly catching up to the traditional heavyweights: China. In fact, China’s ascension to battery development superpower has been vertiginous: the country is expected to produce 70% of the world’s EV batteries by 2021.

This is why Airbus has selected the Airbus China Innovation Centre (ACIC) in Shenzhen as the location for a new battery lab. Opened in August 2019, the lab will not only tap into the rich ecosystem of Shenzhen—China’s tech hub—but also into the ecosystem across China and Asia to test batteries for a range of applications, from electric propulsion to electrical systems.

Supercharged: pushing battery technology to the limit

Despite the impressive progress made in recent decades, the untapped potential of batteries still remains significant. This includes the development of new materials and chemical combinations. The ACIC battery lab is focused on tapping into these possibilities, in addition to running safety and durability tests, and finding solutions to long-standing battery challenges.

One challenge is thermal runaway. Thermal runaway is an unstoppable chain reaction in a battery that causes rapid overheating and can lead to fire. It is rare, but can happen to computers or phones. In 2016, millions of electronic devices had to be recalled after a battery fault caused units to overheat and explode. Although lithium ion is considered the most effective technology currently available for rechargeable batteries, the battery recalls are a reminder that it is not without safety concerns, which limits its use in aviation.

To develop new battery solutions that can be applied to commercial aviation, the ACIC team will collaborate with local partners in Shenzhen. The team will also work closely with the Airbus Battery CoC, the TEIE team in Toulouse that develops new battery solutions for aerospace applications.

“Having a battery lab in China is the perfect complement to our electrical lab in Toulouse,” says Valéry Gineste, Head of TEIE. “The ACIC lab will focus on testing the latest cells and battery technologies to emerge from China, which will reduce time to market.”

Better batteries to power tomorrow’s aerial vehicles

If the aviation industry is to drive progress on the electrification of flight, improving the safety and performance of batteries is crucial. Specifically, the success of urban air mobility and hybrid-electric future aircraft hinges on the development of high-performance and safe battery technology. This is a core focus for the ACIC battery lab, which will work to develop batteries for electric propulsion, a prerequisite to power this new class of aerial vehicles.

“Better batteries will help to enable tomorrow’s aerial vehicles,” Mustang Guo, ACIC Project Manager, explains. “New urban air vehicles, as seen in the case of Vahana and CityAirbus, will require batteries that are not only extremely light and powerful, but also reliable and cost efficient.”

The ACIC battery lab will also look at how to safely replace nickel cadmium with superior lithium-ion batteries to power aircraft systems, without the need for restrictive heavy casing.

Further exploration areas will soon follow as the lab quickly ramps up the scope of its work to explore the wealth of untapped potential that batteries have to offer.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9947726130485535}",positive,0.9947726130485535,1

Gleissl knows better than anyone that sometimes the difference between life and death comes down to a matter of minutes.

Operations you don’t forget

The H145 circles just above the treetops of the Wolfsschlucht, a gorge at Lake Tegernsee. It’s the middle of the night and, down in the gorge, a woman who has been missing for some time is crouched, shivering from the cold. Above her, in the helicopter cabin, Rupert Gleissl is checking the harness and equipment. He hooks up the winch, opens the door and makes his way down. Just before he touches down, he switches on his headlamp. He secures the missing woman, and they are pulled upwards – rescuing her from the gravest danger.

“The woman would hardly have survived another night,” says Gleissl later. “These are operations you don’t forget.” Gleissl, 41, is an engineer at Airbus' helicopter site in Donauwörth, Germany, and a volunteer operations manager and mountain rescuer for the mountain rescue service in Rottach-Egern in Bavaria, Germany. The helicopters he uses during his operations are built by Airbus.

Teamwork between cockpit crew, winch operator and rescuer on the winch

“Our mountain rescue team is called out to the Tegernsee Valley around 250 times a year, and close to 50 of these operations involve helicopters,” says Gleissl. It is Friday afternoon. After working from home, Gleissl is on duty as operations manager at the rescue station. Gleissl and his colleagues discuss their missions, how they fly seriously injured tobogganists to hospital and rescue canyoning adventurers from raging waters. “Winching seven people one after the other from a narrow, water-filled gorge is a challenge,” admits Gleissl. To ensure everything runs smoothly, it is essential that the cockpit crew, winch operator and the rescuer on the winch work well with each other.

The mountain rescue service doesn’t operate its own helicopters. It works with air rescue crews from Germany’s ADAC automobile association, the German air rescue organisation DRF Luftrettung, the Bavarian state police, the German federal police and air rescue services close to the border in Austria. When an emergency call comes in, Gleissl decides whether a helicopter needs to be requested, depending on the situation. “The type of helicopter used depends on whether we need a winch or an emergency doctor on board,” explains Gleissl.

- Rupert Gleissl, an engineer at Airbus in Donauwörth, Germany, and a volunteer operations manager

Alert at the Helicopter base of Christoph 1 in Munich

If the rescue coordination centre dispatches the Munich-based ‘Christoph 1’ medical helicopter, for example, the pagers of the fourstrong crew sound, and paramedic Stefan Schatz notes the operational details. ‘Christoph 1’, an H145, is one of five ADAC winch-equipped rescue helicopters that fly to emergencies in Bavaria several times a day. The destination is noted, helmets are put on, the helicopter is started and the crew run to take their places. “Two minutes after the alert, we’re in the air,” explains pilot and station manager Roland Benning. Benning is particularly impressed with the Airbus Helionix avionics system: “It’s easy to use and simplifies our work in the cockpit. While the helicopter’s on autopilot, I can monitor the surroundings.” As the rescue helicopters have to land anywhere, it is often necessary to avoid paragliders, camera drones or onlookers on the ground, for example. “Many people will approach the helicopter without being aware of the risks,” says Benning.

The Helionix avionics system is easy to use and simplifies our work in the cockpit. While the helicopter’s on autopilot, I can monitor the surroundings.

- Pilot and station manager Roland Benning

Strong wind in the mountains

Rescue missions in the mountains depend in particular on engine performance. “Constantly changing winds and turbulence close to steep mountain faces create problems for us, especially on hot summer days with a foehn wind [a warm down-slope wind on a mountain leeside],” explains Benning. “The H145 copes with these conditions much better than older models.” The mountain rescuers also value the reliable helicopter. “When you’re hanging on the winch, it’s good to know there’s an H145 above you that’s able to withstand the wind,” says Gleissl.

Engineer with a user perspective

Gleissl shares his knowledge of helicopter construction and mountain rescue at Airbus in Donauwörth, when he gets together with the developers and discusses details, such as the easiest way to get through the door with a 15kg air rescue sack and rucksack on your back. “I know things from the user’s perspective and know what a helicopter can do and how it reacts in certain situations,” he explains. “This enables us to enhance the helicopters even further.”

The new Airbus H145 lands on top of the Andes - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL3RoZS1uZXctYWlyYnVzLWgxNDUtbGFuZHMtb24tdG9wLW9mLXRoZS1hbmRlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters has reached new heights: the latest version of the H145 has set its skids down on the Aconcagua, the highest mountain in the Southern Hemisphere, culminating at 6,962 meters (22,840 feet). This is the first time a twin-engine helicopter has landed at this altitude, confirming the performance and the extensive flight envelope of the new H145.

The conditions for this mission were extreme, due to the atmospheric conditions in the area and the winter season. The aircraft took off from Mendoza, Argentina, flew 30 minutes to the foot of the Aconcagua where it began its ascension. After 15 minutes of climbing, the helicopter landed at 1:45 p.m. on the summit, at a temperature of -22 C. The crew onboard the helicopter consisted of Alexander Neuhaus, experimental test pilot and Antoine van Gent, experimental flight test engineer.

“We had to stay focused on the mission due to severe winds with gusts up to 30 knots and the low air density. The handling qualities of the new H145 are excellent and combined with Helionix and its four-axis autopilot, we reached the summit safely,” said Neuhaus. “The aircraft performed outstandingly. We flew over the summit of the Aconcagua and still had power reserves that would have allowed us take two people on-board.”

The flight test was supported by the Fuerza Aerea Argentina, who provided aerial support with their Lama helicopters; Patrulla de Rescate de Alta Montaña de Policia de Mendoza, who assisted with a contingency plan; Parque Provincial Aconcagua, facilitating operations and logistics, and Helicopters AR, a local operator with over 15 years of experience flying in the Aconcagua area with their Airbus H125 helicopter.

This is not the first mountain Airbus Helicopters has mastered. On May 14, 2005, the flight test pilot Didier Delsalle landed a single-engine H125 on Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world.

Prior to the successful high altitude test campaign in South America, the new H145 performed several test campaigns including in Spain at medium altitudes and Finland for cold weather. In total, more than 400 flight hours have already been clocked on the two five-bladed H145 prototypes to ensure European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification by early 2020, followed by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification and first deliveries later that year.

The new version of its best-selling H145 light twin-engine helicopter was unveiled at Heli-Expo 2019 in Atlanta in March. This latest upgrade adds a new, innovative five-bladed rotor to the multi-mission H145, increasing the useful load of the helicopter by 150 kg. The simplicity of the new bearingless main rotor design will also ease maintenance operations, further improving the benchmark serviceability and reliability of the H145, while improving ride comfort for both passengers and crew.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9181523323059082}",neutral,0.9181523323059082,0
Eyes in the sky against maritime pollution - Airbus,"Fri, 20 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE5LTA5LWV5ZXMtaW4tdGhlLXNreS1hZ2FpbnN0LW1hcml0aW1lLXBvbGx1dGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Our marine habitats are under serious threat from pollution. To help monitor, restrict and reduce this damage, organisations around the world are increasingly turning to satellite imagery.

Oceans cover just over 70% of the Earth’s surface. They are the origin and engine of life on our planet, home to some of its most beautiful and intriguing places. But they are under threat.

An estimated 41% of our oceans are adversely impacted by human activity on land. A significant portion of the waste we create ends up flowing into the ocean, including eight million tonnes of plastic each year – the same as 57,000 blue whales. Plastic debris is thought to kill more than one million seabirds and 100,000 marine mammals each year. Whether by accident or design, humans are also responsible for adding other garbage, oil and toxic waste to the ocean.

Satellite Image of Oil Rig Explosion in the Gulf of Mexico

The ocean is the least monitored area on the planet. With increased pollution and damage to marine habitats, there is a growing need to better monitor this vast area of the Earth’s surface. The role of Earth observation is becoming increasingly valuable, offering effective global insight and providing detailed very high-resolution satellite imagery to support current monitoring efforts from traditional flying platforms and patrol vessels.

- Florian Thirion, Maritime Marketing Manager, Communication, Intelligence & Security at Airbus

The need to actively reduce the causes and consequences of marine pollution has never been greater – a message spread by events like World Cleanup Day on 21 September (see below for more details). But to manage the problem, we need to know exactly what we’re dealing with.

Earth observation satellites, which normally operate between 200 and 1,000 kilometres above the Earth, are proving increasingly valuable. They can detect changes in sea state, ocean colour, temperature and reflectance caused by objects in the water. This information helps governments, researchers and environmental organisations detect and monitor areas of pollution and work out how to combat them.

How satellites detect ocean pollution

Earth observation satellites are able to capture images of huge areas multiple times a day, ranging from a few hundred square kilometres to more than 50,000. The quality of image data across an area remains consistent.

That data falls into two categories – optical and radar. Optical satellites produce imagery similar to a classic photograph – as the human eye sees the world. As such, they can only produce images under the right light and weather conditions. Radar satellite imagery, however, can produce images day or night in almost any weather.

So, what can they see? Airbus’ TerraSAR-X radar satellite can capture images with resolutions of up to 40 metres, making it ideal for detecting objects across large areas and highlighting changes in surface patterns – an oil spill, for example. The company’s Pléiades constellation of optical satellites have a resolution of 50 centimetres – one pixel for every half a metre – but cover a smaller area. That makes them good at identifying specific boats or objects previously detected by a radar satellite.

The images are used by a variety of organisations, from the European Space Agency (ESA) to coastguard authorities and the United Nations. In the last couple of years, Airbus satellites have helped to detect and monitor oil spills, shipwrecks and toxic gulf weed in the Caribbean.

TerraSAR-X

Pléiades NEO

The company also provides imagery to Waste Free Oceans, which collects and transforms ocean waste into new, innovative products like emergency shelters, educational material and furniture. And it is partnering with The Ocean Cleanup, a Dutch-based company looking to deploy floating garbage collectors many of hundreds of metres long.

New technology for easier detection

Detecting plastic isn’t easy. Ocean waste patches are mostly made up of tiny pieces too small for satellites to detect. ESA is funding research that uses the Airbus-built Sentinel-2 satellites in an attempt to solve the issue. Because plastic has a different light signature to vegetation, scientists are developing an index to analyse each pixel of a satellite image. By refining the approach and using machine learning, it hopes to build up a clearer picture of marine plastic pollution.

Airbus is also working on new solutions to the problem. In 2020, it will launch the first satellites in its Pléiades Neo constellation, capable of delivering images with a resolution of 30 centimetres. Zephyr, the company’s high-altitude pseudo-satellite, will soon be able to provide additional local image support from its position in the stratosphere, 20 kilometres above the Earth.

Zephyr

Another valuable method of detection is on the water itself. A new smartphone app under development will enable ocean users to report areas of pollution. Satellite imagery will attempt to verify the sightings, before alerting the appropriate authorities.

World clean up day

One of the largest civic movements of our time, World Cleanup Day unites more than 150 countries across the globe. On 21 September 2019, an estimated 18 million volunteers and partners will spend 36 hours cleaning up litter and waste from our beaches, rivers, forests, and streets.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9979426264762878}",neutral,0.9979426264762878,0

ACH145 and ACH135 also star at Monaco Yacht Show

Monaco - Airbus Corporate Helicopters (ACH) will this week begin demonstrating the world’s most advanced medium helicopter – the ACH160 – to prospective customers at the Monaco Yacht Show, the world’s foremost super yacht event.

The aircraft will form the centrepiece of a triumvirate of Airbus helicopters also including the market-leading ACH145 and the lighter ACH135 – all fitted to purpose for yacht operations.

The ACH160 promises to be a striking sight over Monaco’s bay on 26th September with a landing and take-off from the 139m Lürssen Flying Fox. It sets a new benchmark in corporate transportation with a blend of innovative technology, speed, comfort and style. Its interior concept is the result of a collaboration between ACH Creative Style Studio and Harrison Eidsgaard, one of the most sought after names in the superyacht design industry.

The first two ACH160 are already on the final assembly line at Airbus’ Marignane plant. EASA Certification of the H160 in transport configuration is due by the end of the year and the first ACH160 will be delivered next year.

Also on display will be an ACH135, equipped with Airbus’ ACH Line in-house interior, embarked on M/Y Bintador, a Tankoa-built 50m yacht at location C09.

The range is rounded off by an ACH145 based on the terrace of the Yacht Club de Monaco. This helicopter is finished in the Mercedes Benz Style Special Edition.

Visitors can also see the latest release of the ACH Yacht Interface App, a tool dedicated to supporting yacht designers and shipbuilders in integrating ACH aircraft into new yacht projects. This tool provides key preliminary information for incorporating ACH helicopters on-board and serves to prevent costly retrofits.

Head of Airbus Corporate Helicopters, Frederic Lemos, said: “We are thrilled to be at Monaco once more and we look forward to demonstrating the suitability of our helicopter range to the needs of yacht designers, builders and owners.”

According to reports, at least one Airbus A220 was damaged when the fire suppression system suddenly activated, covering the aircraft with fire retardant foam.

Airbus’ spokeswoman has confirmed the incident to AeroTime:

“On Friday, Sept. 13, during off-production time, the fire suppression system activated in one of the support hangars at the Airbus manufacturing facility in Mobile, Alabama USA”. As of now, the manufacturer cannot say whether the hangar burned because “there was no indication of a fire”, according to the Airbus representative.

Fortunately, Airbus did confirm that nobody was hurt when the fire suppression system activated. However, while the hangar is closed and “on-site assessment teams work to determine the cause of the activation”, Airbus also confirms that there were two aircraft placed in the hangar and are “are being evaluated” by the manufacturer.

The manufacturing site began producing the A220 on August 5, 2019, while the first Alabama-built A320 left the Mobile site on April 25, 2016 and Airbus delivered it to JetBlue (JBLU) . Airbus is yet to deliver its first A220 to a customer, but the Alabama branch has stated that first deliveries are scheduled to begin in Q3 2020, with Delta Air Lines being the launch customer of the Mobile-built Airbus A220-300.

Airbus is in “direct contact with the customers to keep them informed” about the potential situation, but has not disclosed whether the two aircraft were damaged substantially or, at all.

Called the RM 62-01 Tourbillon Vibrating Alarm ACJ¹, the new watch’s innovative features include a discreet alarm that alerts the wearer through vibrations that only they can feel.

The watch is a true creation of the best of both ACJ and Richard Mille. It encapsulates the pioneering, proven and industry-leading expertise from two companies, known for delivering the highest standards and most exclusive customer experiences in their industries. An evolution of an earlier watch², it continues a partnership begun in 2016.

The announcement was made alongside a 1/20th scale model of the ACJ320neo featuring a Melody cabin in unique Richard Mille livery, highlighting the link between the companies.

“Our partnership is built on a shared passion for new technology and innovation that pushes the boundaries. We always aim to offer unique experiences to our clients, which are sometimes the same,” says ACJ President Benoit Defforge.

“Airbus corporate jets are instruments of beauty, precision and utility, just like our watches, and we both strive to create products that go beyond delivering practicality to provide elegance, exclusivity and eternal value,“ adds Richard Mille Founder and CEO Richard Mille.

As with the previous watch collaboration, sketches of the new design were initially created by ACJ Head of Creative Design, Sylvain Mariat, with the watch being turned into reality by a team at Richard Mille, including Salvador Arbona, Technical Director for Movements.

The face of the new watch comprises titanium/Carbon TPT® that has been machined to represent the shape of an aircraft window, revealing different layers that echo the grain of the exotic wood typically found in corporate jet cabins. The crown-winder features engine fan-blades, while the sides of the watch are reminiscent of intricate, sculpted, metal aircraft-structure, as are miniature torque-set screws.

Skeletonisation – a hallmark of Richard Mille watches – reveals the sophistication of the movement inside – visible through the transparent front and back.

In bringing together the worlds of aviation and horology, the watch embodies the superlative engineering and shared values of both, and is available through Richard Mille in a limited edition of just 30 pieces.

Prosecutors in the southern German city of Munich are investigating 17 named suspects. They are accused of revealing or encouraging people to reveal sensitive trade and company secrets.

""Some of our employees had documents that they shouldn't have had,"" an Airbus source said on Wednesday.

The confidential documents relate to two planned military procurement projects.

The Airbus employees under suspicion apparently knew the requirements of the German army, the potential customer, and thus had an advantage over other competitors during the bidding process.

Politicians were quick to call for an investigation.

Problematic behaviour

""In normal life, a company would be shut out from the tender process for the projects in question,"" following such revelations, Greens party defence spokesman Tobias Lindner told daily Die Welt.

It is ""problematic that employees at a defence firm should know in advance the army's requirements for its future projects,"" fellow defence committee member Alexander Mueller of the Free Democratic Party told the French news agency AFP.

Defence spokesman Lars Ebinger said it was impossible to predict the impact on procurement while the case was being investigated.

Airbus said in a statement on Thursday, that the company ""fully supports the relevant authorities with their investigation.""

The news came a day after the European planemaker upped its estimate of the number of new aircraft needed over the next 20 years.

#ACH145 #AirbusCorporateHelicopters @AirbusHeli @rev_ocean

Monaco Yacht Show – Airbus Helicopters is to provide the on-board helicopter for the REV Ocean research and expedition vessel – the world’s largest superyacht.

The research expedition vessel, which is 600ft (183m) long, is the flagship of Norwegian businessman and philanthropist Kjell Inge Røkke’s not-for-profit oceanic research foundation, REV Ocean.

It will carry one of the first examples of the new Airbus ACH145, with five-blade rotor and increased maximum take-off weight.

The yacht, designed by Espen Oeino, has arrived in Norway from the VARD Tulcea shipyard in Romania and will accept the helicopter on board when the aircraft is delivered in 2021.

The helicopter, which can operate from either of two helidecks on the yacht, plays a key role in passenger transport and re-supply as well as its primary scientific mission.

Launched in 2019 and due for certification early in 2020, the new Airbus ACH145 has a bearingless five-blade rotor replacing the existing hingeless four-blade rotor, and provides 150kg additional useful load-carrying capability.

REV Ocean was established as a result of Mr Røkke signing the Giving Pledge campaign in 2017, vowing to give away more than 50% of his fortune to philanthropic causes. Any profit generated is reinvested into the work programme for a healthier ocean.

As well as the ACH145, the vessel is equipped with scientific trawls, sonar systems, laboratories, auditorium and classrooms, moonpool, unmanned aerial vehicle, a remotely operated submarine with 6000 meters depth capacity, and advanced communication equipment. It has a crew of up to 35 and can carry 60 scientists.

Head of Airbus Corporate Helicopters, Frederic Lemos, said: “It is a true privilege to have our helicopter selected by REV Ocean for this prestigious project. We very much look forward to playing our role in advancing the important work being carried out by Kjell Inge Røkke and his team.”

REV Ocean CEO, Nina Jensen, said: “We are delighted to be getting the ACH145 helicopter from Airbus. This will allow us to support our science operations and transport our passengers with the highest levels of safety, efficiency and environmental standards.”

Airbus demonstrates ACH160 on yacht for first time - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1cy1kZW1vbnN0cmF0ZXMtYWNoMTYwLW9uLXlhY2h0LWZvci1maXJzdC10aW1lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Corporate Helicopters (ACH) will this week begin demonstrating the advanced medium helicopter, the ACH160, to prospective customers at the Monaco Yacht Show, the world’s foremost super yacht event.

The aircraft will form the centerpiece of a triumvirate of Airbus helicopters also including the market-leading ACH145 and the lighter ACH135 – all fitted to purpose for yacht operations.

The ACH160 promises to be a striking sight over Monaco’s bay on Sept. 26 with a landing and take-off from the 139m Lürssen Flying Fox. It sets a new benchmark in corporate transportation with a blend of innovative technology, speed, comfort and style. Its interior concept is the result of a collaboration between ACH Creative Style Studio and Harrison Eidsgaard, one of the most sought after names in the superyacht design industry.

The first two ACH160 are already on the final assembly line at Airbus’s Marignane plant. European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification of the H160 in transport configuration is due by the end of the year and the first ACH160 will be delivered next year.

Also on display will be an ACH135, equipped with Airbus’s ACH Line in-house interior, embarked on M/Y Bintador, a Tankoa-built 50m yacht at location C09.

The range is rounded off by an ACH145 based on the terrace of the Yacht Club de Monaco. This helicopter is finished in the Mercedes Benz Style Special Edition.

Visitors can also see the latest release of the ACH Yacht Interface App, a tool dedicated to supporting yacht designers and shipbuilders in integrating ACH aircraft into new yacht projects. This tool provides key preliminary information for incorporating ACH helicopters on-board and serves to prevent costly retrofits.

Head of Airbus Corporate Helicopters, Frederic Lemos, said: “We are thrilled to be at Monaco once more and we look forward to demonstrating the suitability of our helicopter range to the needs of yacht designers, builders and owners.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999414682388306}",neutral,0.9999414682388306,0

Airbus A340-600 chopped up into coffee tables - CNN,"Thu, 19 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWEzNDAtNjAwLWNvZmZlZS10YWJsZXMvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

The afterlife of a decommissioned airplane can take many forms nowadays.

Some are dismantled and used as parts, others simply end up in aircraft graveyards, while a select few are reinvented as modern restaurants or hotels.

However, Lufthansa has gone for a rather different approach with a retired Airbus A340-600.

The German airline is giving the aircraft, identified by the registration code D-AIHO – a fresh start as a brand new product collection.

Created as part of a collaboration between Lufthansa, traveler loyalty program Miles & More GmbH and Lufthansa Technik, the Lufthansa Upcycling Collection is made from parts of the plane, which was withdrawn after 10 years of service.

Repurposing parts

The plane’s slats and side panels have been transformed into coffee tables, while a separate table has been made from two of its windows and a sheet of safety glass.

Four of its other windows were converted into two trendy wall bars, and a further 20 have been made into wall clocks.

Many are one-off items and this is clearly reflected in the prices.

The tables range from $1,550 to $3,300, while the wall bars cost between $1,327 and $1,660.

A keyring made from the plane’s aluminum cladding will set you back $27.

“The special thing about the Lufthansa Upcycling Collection is that something of the aircraft’s spirit can be preserved,” says Sebastian Riedle, spokesperson and managing director of Miles & More GmbH.

Second life

“There are so many possibilities to give discarded materials a second life in a different way.”

Airbus’s four-engine A340-600 ultra long-haul aircraft, the world’s second longest passenger airplane, were first introduced nearly 20 years ago, but manufacturingon the A340 series ceased in 2011 to make way for the more fuel efficient A350. Lufthansa was one of the A340’s biggest operators.

The airline’s design team have also made good use of the aircraft’s exterior, creating briefcases and backpacks from business class blankets and headrest covers branded with its now defunct logo, which were “much too valuable to throw away.”

Even the plane’s safety cards have been recycled and used to reinforce the bottom of upcycled wash bags.

It took nearly 10 weeks to dismantle the 75-meter long airplane into pieces small enough to create the Lufthansa Upcycling Collection.

Approximately 92% of the original aircraft, which was the world’s longest passenger aircraft at the time of its launch, was recycled for the project.

Repurposing aircraft parts as quality goods is getting increasingly popular as the airline industry moves towards becoming more eco-friendly.

Airbus released a line of furniture and home accessories made from upcycled aircraft parts via online shop A Piece of Sky earlier this year.

In 2018, luxury watch company Bremont, which makes timepieces for pilots, marked the 50th anniversary of Concorde by launching a limited edition timepiece, the Bremont Supersonic, which incorporated parts of the decommissioned aircraft.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999868869781494}",neutral,0.9999868869781494,0

A survey of more than 6,000 people has revealed that a growing number of travelers in Europe and America have already reduced the number of flights they took over the last 12 months because of heightened environmental awareness.

Around one in four flyers in France, Germany and the U.S revealed to UBS that they had reduced flights. A smaller number of Brits (16%) admitted that climate change had forced them to forego at least one trip.

Chief author of the report's findings and UBS's Head of European Industrials Equity Research, Celine Fornaro, added in the note Monday that around 27% of respondents were now ""thinking about it,"" when asked if climate worries could affect travel plans.

That figure marked a rise from a similar survey taken by UBS in May which came out at 20%.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9994599223136902}",negative,0.9994599223136902,-1

The Cairo-based airline intends to fly the aircraft on routes to and from its main Egyptian Hub in Cairo in the coming days.

Representatives from the airline, alongside executives from Airbus Canada Limited Partnership, celebrated the aircraft handover at the A220 Mirabel final assembly line.

“We are proud to welcome our very first A220 aircraft and to be the first airline in the Middle East and North African region to take delivery and launch commercial operations of the A220 – the most innovative and technologically advanced aircraft in the world,” said Capt. Ahmed Adel, Chairman and CEO, EGYPTAIR HOLDING Company. “Airbus' A220 airliners are integral to the execution of EGYPTAIR business development strategy Horizon 2025 and fleet optimization plan.”

“We are delighted to welcome EGYPTAIR to the growing family of A220 operators and look forward to seeing their passengers enjoy the experience of travelling on board the A220‘s bright, spacious and modern cabin,” said Philippe Balducchi, CEO, Airbus Canada Limited Partnership and Airbus Head of Country Canada.

EGYPTAIR’s brand-new A220-300 is configured in a two-class cabin with 140-seats including 15 premium economy and 125 economy class seats, offering every passenger a greater level of comfort and space.

The A220 is the only aircraft purpose-built for the 100-150 seat market; it delivers unbeatable fuel efficiency and widebody passenger comfort in a single-aisle aircraft. The A220 brings together state-of-the-art aerodynamics, advanced materials and Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation PW1500G geared turbofan engines to offer at least 20% lower fuel burn per seat compared to previous-generation aircraft. The A220 offers the performance of larger single-aisle aircraft.

EGYPTAIR currently operates a fleet of 15 Airbus aircraft and still has 15 A320neo aircraft as well as 11 A220 aircraft to be delivered in the coming years.

With an order book of over 500 aircraft at the end of August 2019, the A220 has all the credentials to win the lion’s share of the 100- to 150-seat aircraft market estimated to represent at least 7,000 aircraft over the next 20 years.

This is the second safety bulletin issued by the helicopter manufacturer in a month.

On August 31, 2019, an AS350 B3E, registered LN-OFU and operated by Helitrans, crashed near a music festival in Alta, in the far north of Norway. The company was offering sight-seeing tours for the festival-goers. The six people on board were killed. The aircraft involved had less than 73 flying hours.

While the investigation is still in progress, “preliminary findings linked to the connection between the engine and the main gearbox has lead AH to issue an Emergency Alert Service Bulletin (EASB) calling for immediate visual inspection of this area for recently delivered AS350, AS550 and EC130 helicopters,” announced the Accident Investigation Board Norway (AIBN) in a press release, adding that it ”has, at this stage, not concluded whether, or not, failure of the connection between the engine and the main gearbox is a causal factor”. According to Airbus, the EASB bulletins are intended to ensure the airworthiness of the aircraft. Two experts from the French Civil Aviation Safety Investigation Authority (BEA) are assisting the AIBN.

Last month, on August 8, 2019, the German Federal Armed Forces grounded their fleet of EC665 Tiger attack helicopters following a safety warning issued by Airbus Helicopters. The manufacturer warned that a titanium bolt of the Main Rotor Control may show unusual weakness and break during flights. Such failure could potentially lead to a crash. Thus, the Bundeswehr decided to ground the fleet and inspect each aircraft.

The same problem was also identified on the German NH90 and EC135 helicopters, but as the material is not used in critical areas, they were allowed to continue operating for now.

A month before, the Australian defense ministry launched a request for information (RFI) to replace its 22 EC665 Tigers, criticizing the aircraft for its low availability and high maintenance cost. In a jab to the Airbus aircraft, the RFI asked for the 29 replacement attack helicopters to be “proven and mature, off-the-shelf”.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9956875443458557}",neutral,0.9956875443458557,0

Saturday 18 May 2019 is a date that Verónica Blanco will never forget. The 29-year-old was windsurfing in Pichidangui Bay, off the Chilean coast, when her equipment malfunctioned, leaving her marooned in the water without any hope of getting back to dry land and at the mercy of strong winds and the currents and chilly waters of the South Pacific.

Nor will she ever forget the sound of the AS332 F1 piloted by Lieutenant Commander Carlos Schaidt, or the rescue swimmer, Staff Sergeant Manuel Pizarro, who freed her from her equipment and took her safely aboard, by which time her body temperature had dropped to below 35⁰C.

A HIGHLY COMPLEX MISSION

Verónica’s family had reported her missing at around 5pm, at which point the Coquimbo Maritime Authority deployed search and rescue teams on land and sea. Unfortunately, due to the heavy swell, current, strong winds and poor visibility, these resources were insufficient, with the decision then being made to activate the air response. Two helicopters were assigned to the mission: a Dauphin from the Naval Helicopter Squadron, and a Super Puma usually operated by the Attack Squadron. “Given the complexity of the mission, we tried to get the helicopters in the air as soon as possible,” Schaidt explains.

The Dauphin was deployed in advance and was the first to reach the last known coordinates, conducting an initial search in the form of an expanding square (see sidebar). In the meantime, preparations were made for the AS332 and its crew to replace the Dauphin when it came in to refuel.

“The Cougar Super Puma carried out a search with a more comprehensive range of equipment, which made things easier for us, thanks to the infrared night-vision camera and the optronic sensor,” Schaidt says.

SIGHTED AT LAST

The Super Puma traced a creeping line search pattern and, after flying over the area for a little more than an hour, the infrared camera operator spotted a shape floating in the sea.

Taking up the story, Schaidt says: “When we spotted the person, the pressure on the team was huge because we knew that there was someone in danger and that every second counted. We then marked a point close to the position with a lighted distress signal and began the approach manoeuvre. We used the 4-axis autopilot to keep the aircraft stable so that we could lower the rescue swimmer and recover the victim.

“In addition to the training and experience of the crew, we wouldn’t have been able to complete the rescue if the helicopter hadn’t had the equipment we needed to maintain a secure and stable position while hovering, with no points of reference, at night and out at sea. Nor would we have been able to spot her without the help of the optronic sensor.”

The lieutenant commander and the rest of the crew received recognition for their efforts a few days later, at a ceremony held on Chile’s Navy Day, where they met with Verónica’s family.

For us and for me personally, it humanises the technical aspects of a rescue mission and it makes you aware just how beautiful and important this job that we have to do is.

Airbus versus Boeing – A pilot’s perspective - Skies Magazine,"Thu, 19 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZXNtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLXZlcnN1cy1ib2VpbmctYS1waWxvdHMtcGVyc3BlY3RpdmUv0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly9za2llc21hZy5jb20vbmV3cy9haXJidXMtdmVyc3VzLWJvZWluZy1hLXBpbG90cy1wZXJzcGVjdGl2ZS8_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Steve Zago | September 19, 2019 Steve Zago |

Estimated reading time 11 minutes, 30 seconds.

Editor’s note: The following blog post originally appeared on ScudRunners.com and reflects the opinions of the author. Visit the Skies Facebook page to share your thoughts on the Boeing versus Airbus debate!

As the autopilot disconnect horn chirped in the flightdeck, I had to remind myself not to move the sidestick too much in response to the turbulence that was tossing my Airbus A330 around the sky like a cork in a rough sea.

I left the auto thrust on and let the ground speed mini function work its magic while I fought the urge to move the controls back and forth in response to every wing drop, trusting the fly-by-wire system to do its job while I used minor inputs to keep the widebody aircraft on glidepath through 1,000 feet.

The winds weren’t anywhere near the max crosswind of 45 knots, but there were reports of wind sheer on final and the gusty 30-knot crosswind was going to be the strongest I’d encountered in my second month operating the A330.

Just over a year earlier, I had begrudgingly made the transition from my beloved Boeing 737NG to the Airbus A320 aircraft (and eventually to the A330). I had many reasons to be enamoured with the Boeing workhorse: it was my first airline command; I had been an instructor on the aircraft for four years and I knew it inside and out. I enjoyed the schedule and most importantly, it was a joy to fly.

The main difference I discovered very quickly was the flight control system – not just the sidestick but the entire fly-by-wire system and the rationale behind it. In the 737, if I was flying a heavy crosswind like the one mentioned above, I’d be working the yoke back and forth like a champ to keep the wings level. There’s no fly-by-wire computer telling the flight control system to keep the wings in the last attitude commanded by my inputs, as there is on the Airbus.

The Airbus versus Boeing debate is age-old. I’ve heard many a comment about the inferiority of the European design; heck, I’ve even agreed with some of the critiques. Now, as an experienced Airbus training pilot, I still agree with a few. I miss my direct control of the aircraft, the ability to know exactly what the autopilot (or new co-pilot) was doing by just having a few fingers on the yoke. A relaxed hand on the thrust lever allowed me to loosely follow along with the autopilot control inputs while I kept my head outside in busy airspace or on final approach.

It took me about five sim sessions to stop being skeptical of the Airbus, and to start appreciating the positive aspects of the European OEM’s approach to building an airplane. For starters, the flightdeck is a significantly more comfortable workspace, and less cramped. While the sidestick took some getting used to, its location allows for an amazing tray table (no longer eating my meals on my lap like an animal has its perks!) and the ability to move your legs around. It also allows for you to use the quick reference handbook (QRH) much more efficiently, since you can just leave it open to a particular page and not have to stash it on the dash or worry about it falling off your lap while flicking switches. (More on checklist usage below.)

The main difference between the two, as touched on earlier, is the flight control “law” system utilized in the “bus.” In a typical aircraft, if you want to turn left 25 degrees, you turn the control column to the left and apply a slight back pressure to maintain altitude and hold some measure of input to maintain the turn. Not so on the Airbus. Instead, you move the sidestick to the left, with no need to apply backstick until above 30 degrees. Upon reaching 25 degrees angle of bank, you can release the stick and the flight control system will maintain the “requested” angle of bank and pitch attitude.

It is not uncommon for Airbus pilots (especially new ones like me last year) to forget the aircraft is not on autopilot when you can set a heading and attitude and take your hand off the stick and watch the aircraft hold both perfectly. Any deviation (i.e. a wing drop due to turbulence) and the system will counter it automatically to maintain the selected path. Hence my reminder on short final on a windy day not to “fight” the turbulence with opposite control inputs as I would have done on the Boeing, but to let the system do its job.

There are multiple levels of complexity to the flight control system on the bus that would take many more pages to describe (and many more years of flying on my part to fully understand) but a few examples are flare mode, alternate law, soft cruise mode, direct law, alpha protection, etc. Suffice it to say a control system like this is reliant on a complicated network of computers (five flight control computers on the A330 and seven on the A320). Heck, losing both radio altimeters is actually an event in the Airbus, as it will eventually force you into direct law on final (which can at times feel like balancing on the head of a needle control-wise). Meanwhile, the only thing affected on the Boeing in normal operations would be the auto callout system.

One other main difference between Boeing and the Airbus is the way critical information is presented to the pilot. The annunciation system on the 737 would not look out of place on an older-era 727 or even 707. When a system failure not directly in line of sight of the pilot (i.e. on the overhead panel) is triggered, a master caution annunciation illuminated on the glare shield directs the pilot’s attention to a small illuminated annunciation telling them where to look on the overhead panel. As an added bonus, only systems directly above the pilot or co-pilot are displayed on their respective annunciator, so as a captain if there is an issue with the pressurization system it will be highlighted on the first officer’s annunciator. You then look up to see which specific system is malfunctioning by the presence of an amber light on the overhead panel; for example, a GEN 1 fault. This may sound straightforward in theory (and I believed it so for the five years I operated the 737) but time is wasted determining the fault and it can be open to mis-identification as well.

A typical illuminated fault procedure looks something like this:

*Master caution illuminates on the glareshield*

Pilot 1 – “Master caution, what’s the problem?”

Pilot 2 – Reads the annunciator panel – notes ELEC illuminated “master caution electrical.”

Pilot 2 – Looks overhead “GEN 2 FAULT” – “Master caution reset”

Pilot 1 – “GEN 2 fault non-normal checklist.”

Now, let’s juxtapose this with a fault on the A330 or A321 (the systems are identical). The ECAM, or Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor system, presents the pilot with a single screen denoting the fault, rectification and relevant systems affected and CAT 2/3 approach status. All in one.

Lose that same generator and you’ll get a chime directing you to the ECAM; there, “GEN 1” fault will be displayed along with the checklist and items will disappear from the screen as they are accomplished. If you can reset the system via ECAM, then the relevant systems affected are also displayed under a “status page.” This greatly streamlines identifying and correcting system malfunctions.

Newer Boeing designs have their own version of the ECAM system, which I cannot comment on as I have only flown the 737.

There are a myriad of differences between the two types that a single article could not cover, and I’d say both have their strength and weaknesses. One thing I really appreciated was the ease of transitioning to the A330 from the A321; the flightdecks are so similar that unless you are specifically trained on one or the other, you wouldn’t be able to tell the difference if you were blindfolded and dropped into either one.

There are some systems differences, mainly with hydraulics and electrical, but otherwise the procedures, memory items, ECAM operation, and flight control law are all nearly identical. And, while hand-flying the Airbus can feel a lot more like asking a computer to do it for you, the ease of operation allows one to manage the aircraft better, with better situational awareness.

I realize that my experience may be different from yours and my opinions here can be subjective; however, I have enjoyed operating both types.

In the end, whenever I get asked the age-old question, “Which do you prefer?”, my typical answer is, “I miss flying the Boeing, but I prefer operating the Airbus.”

Steve Zago currently flies the Airbus A330 for Air Transat and is based in Toronto.

Chuck Yeager is still ready for a fight and he’s taken on the second biggest aerospace company in the world. Yeager is suing Airbus for allegedly using his name and photo to promote a new helicopter design without paying him. The trademark infringement suit filed last week describes him as “one of the most, if not the most, famous pilots of all time.” It says Airbus’s 2017 web posting about its Racer high-speed helicopter, referencing his 1947 breaking of the sound barrier, essentially exploits the personal brand that has grown from that famous flight.

According to Reuters, the offending passage was a quote from Guillaume Faury, the current Airbus CEO and the CEO at Airbus Helicopters at the time. “Seventy years ago, Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier,” the posting quoted Faury as saying and that Airbus was now “trying to break the cost barrier. It cannot be ‘speed at any cost.’” Yeager is alleging the posting mislead readers into believing he endorsed the new helicopter. There is some history of friction between Yeager and Airbus. He had previously demanded $1 million for permission to use his name in Airbus press releases after the company released a video of him touring a factory. There was some discussion of the idea but it didn’t result in an agreement.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9989537000656128}",neutral,0.9989537000656128,0
Emirates President Slams Airbus and Boeing for Lack of Reliability - Yahoo! Voices,"Wed, 04 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2VtaXJhdGVzLXByZXNpZGVudC1zbGFtcy1haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLTE1MDAxNTgxNS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Emirates President Slams Airbus and Boeing for Lack of Reliability

Emirates President Tim Clark on Wednesday sharply criticized Boeing and Airbus along with engine suppliers Rolls-Royce and General Electric for failing to make reliable products, saying the companies may lose business as the global economy slows and airlines become more selective about which planes they will accept.

“I am a little bit irritated that, over the years, we as an airline, and I think as the industry, have been subjected to the requirements of the propulsion manufacturers, and to an extent the airframe manufacturers, where we are expected to deal with quality control issues and design issues, and operate these aircraft and engines, and take whatever consequences there are when they don’t work,” Clark said during a briefing in London, where he was attending the Aviation Festival. “We are not in a business to deal with aircraft that don’t function properly.”

Clark’s comments come as Emirates, its fleet long dominated by mammoth Airbus A380s, prepares for a future in which it flies more dual-engined jets and fewer four-engine superjumbos. Over the past six years, Emirates has placed orders for, or expressed serious interest in, the newest jets produced by Boeing and Airbus, such as the Airbus A350, Airbus 330neo, Boeing 777X and Boeing 787.

On Wednesday, however, Clark warned the manufacturers he won’t take any of the jets until Airbus and Boeing can deliver the reliability Emirates expects.

Safety is not an issue, Clark said, but Emirates cannot afford to keep pulling its most expensive assets from service because the airframe or engine needs repair. He said Emirates aims to achieve at least 99.5 percent reliability from its fleet, and expects to do little maintenance on an airplane for the first five years of its life.

“I’m not saying we don’t like the A330,” he said. “I’m not saying we won’t like the 787-9 and -10. I’m not saying we don’t like the A350. These are hugely potent aircraft that eventually will get all their operations sorted out. They are outstanding designs. Unfortunately they’re not being put together as well as they should be.”

Representatives for Boeing and Airbus were not immediately available for comment.

GE and Rolls-Royce Complaints

In a wide-ranging discussion in a hotel conference room, Clark said Emirates will honor its purchase commitments, but said contracts protect the airline from accepting delivery of aircraft that do not hit specifications, for range, fuel burn and other metrics, that had been promised.

And he hinted Boeing is not close to providing what it has promised for the Boeing 777X. Emirates has ordered 150 of the next-generation jets, but Clark said he is concerned about General Electric’s engine design.

“The fact is, the Boeing 777X is delayed as a result of engine issues, and we are unsure as to when this is going to be resolved” Clark said. “I have been in this business longer than I like to remember, and I have seen airline and engine developments which are beset with problems. The airlines are now being required to deal with those, and work together with manufactures to get them resolved. I say no. I say, ‘you give us airframes and engines that work from day one.’ If you can’t do it, don’t produce them.”

Clark said he has similar concerns with a top GE rival, Rolls-Royce, which makes engines for the A380, as well as other jets.

“There is no stability in the Rolls-Royce program at the moment as we see it,” Clark said.

Reliability Troubles

Clark is far from the only airline executive to express dismay at the current state of airplane and engine manufacturing, though Clark’s comments may have been the sharpest. Before he retired in July, Norwegian Air CEO Bjorn Kjos also regularly publicly criticized Rolls-Royce, blaming it in part for the airline’s financial woes.

Worldwide, airlines have been forced to ground airplanes for extra inspections or to change engines sooner than expected because of problems with Rolls-Royce engines on Boeing 787s. British Airways and Norwegian have been forced to charter jets from other operators in order to fly the schedule they promised to consumers.

Clark said he wonders why airlines keep going to Airbus and Boeing headquarters to pick up airplanes that are not as reliable as promised. Clark noted the manufacturers won’t let Emirates take the airplane “if there is one cent missing from the final payment” yet airlines are often willing to accept a machine they know has problems.

He said Emirates will do not do so any longer.

“Is that not unreasonable?” he asked. “We have 615 people on 15 or 20 of these [A380] aircraft that we own flying around, and if an engine doesn’t work or a part fails, they are stranded at Heathrow or Frankfurt or Auckland. The consequential damage to us is huge because I have to get rid of 615 passengers. I have to disperse them on other carriers, which I have to pay. I have to pay the punitive damages that the Europeans or New Zealand is imposing on us under their consumer protection legislation.”

Clark said the engine manufacturers often tell airlines to take jets with safe but flawed engines, promising the airline they will improve them later. Clark said a car buyer would never accept a car that wasn’t perfect on Day 1, and questioned why airlines are willing to do it.

“[It’s like] if you bought a Rolls Royce or a BMW and Audi or a Mercedes and the dealer told you, ‘I have to work with you because I need to pull out a load of data — we’ll do it all for you — but I have to change your engine after three months and I need to plug in and get all the stuff uploaded as you’re driving to make sure the engine is doing what we think it’s going to do, but I have to have my 250,000 pounds now and then I’ll work with you to ensure that the engine works eventually according to what you wanted,'” Clark said. “That’s probably the best analogy.”

Choosier Going Forward

For decades, Emirates was on a growth binge, seeking to quickly add long-haul routes. In doing so, Clark said, the airline may not have been as careful as it could have been in evaluating quality.

“In the pursuit of getting the job done in the past, given the growth trajectory that Emirates imposed upon itself, given the tools that we needed … we had to accept levels of technical excellence well below where they were,” he said.

Clark said he expects global travel demand soon will slow, and as it does, he said he expects more airlines will adopt his attitude toward new aircraft.

“When they don’t give me airplanes and engines that work, it’s over,” he said. “Now you produce what you say you produce. When we are ready, we’ll take it.”

"Airbus trade feud spurs new Trump risk for Boeing, airlines - American Journal of Transportation","Wed, 25 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFqb3QuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLXRyYWRlLWZldWQtc3B1cnMtbmV3LXRydW1wLXJpc2stZm9yLWJvZWluZy1haXJsaW5lc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By: Justin Bachman | Sep 25 2019 at 08:38 PM | Air Cargo | International Trade

U.S. tariffs on European airplanes and luxury goods are emerging as a new threat not just for Airbus SE but for U.S. airlines. The risk is rising for Boeing Co. as well if the European Union seeks to retaliate.

The World Trade Organization will authorize the U.S. to impose tariffs on nearly $8 billion of European goods due to illegal state aid provided to Airbus, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday. The U.S. duties, which could hit as soon as October, will target planes and aircraft parts as well as luxury products such as wine and leather goods, according to the U.S. Trade Representative’s office.

The WTO decision marks an escalation in a long-running dispute that the U.S. and EU have waged over aircraft-manufacturing subsidies, and will further test trans-Atlantic relations that are already under stress from President Donald Trump’s “America First” strategy. The deterioration endangers the cross-border ties that Boeing, Airbus and global airlines rely on.

“I’m a little concerned because this certainly fits the Trump administration’s aggressive approach to trade,” said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst with Teal Group. “Not crossing borders isn’t an option in this industry. Exports aren’t gravy in this business—they’re absolutely the lifeline.”

Wine, Handbags

The WTO award is lower than the Trump administration’s request to impose tariffs on as much as $11.2 billion worth of European exports stemming from the nearly 15-year-old dispute.

The U.S. hasn’t finalized which goods it will hit, but the preliminary list also includes whiskey, motorcycles, leather handbags, cheese and wine. The duties may also hit products made by Europe’s producers of luxury brands—like LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, Christian Dior SE and Hermes International.

In the airline industry, U.S. carriers are pushing back.

“It is unprecedented for the government to impose tariffs on aircraft,” said Airlines for America, a trade group. “It’s widely believed that new tariffs on aircraft would negatively impact the U.S. commercial aviation industry as well as the overall economy.”

An Airbus factory in Mobile, Alabama, depends on imported parts to build the company’s top-selling A320 family jets, which are also made in Europe and China. The European planemaker plans to expand the U.S. site to build the smaller A220 as orders increase from U.S. carriers including JetBlue Airways Corp. and Delta Air Lines Inc.

‘Serious Harm’

“Imposing tariffs on aircraft that U.S. companies have already committed to would inflict serious harm on U.S. airlines, the millions of Americans they employ and the U.S. traveling public,” Delta spokeswoman Lisa Hanna said in a statement.

In a statement, Airbus said it doesn’t comment on “rumors on a report that is not public.” But the company said: “A tariffs battle is a no-win situation for the entire global aviation industry. Airbus continues to favor a negotiated solution to resolve this complex trade dispute.”

Boeing declined to comment.

In a separate WTO case, the EU claimed that Boeing benefited from illegal subsidies, including from the state of Washington. That case is likely to conclude in the next six to nine months, according to Bank of America Corp.

Before that, the U.S. may seek to “apply maximum pressure” while “targeting a settlement before the EU could legally apply tariffs to Boeing,” Bank of America analyst Benjamin Heelan said in a report this week.

Boeing, meanwhile, has a complicated agenda in Europe. The European Commission is conducting an antitrust review of the company’s proposed commercial-jet venture with Brazil’s Embraer SA. European regulators are also conducting an independent safety assessment of Boeing’s 737 Max, which has been grounded more than six months.

“The certification process has become increasingly political,” Bernstein analyst Douglas Harned said in a report earlier this month on the WTO sanctions. “This type of action would likely make it worse.”","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.6206499338150024}",negative,0.6206499338150024,-1

Estimated reading time 3 minutes, 20 seconds.

On Sept. 25, the Saskatoon STARS base received an Airbus H145 helicopter as part of a fleet renewal project — the third delivered under this initiative. With an aging fleet of BK117s reaching the end of its service life, it was determined that a new aircraft type be purchased to ensure STARS ability to continue serving the Prairies.

“The Airbus H145 was determined to be the best aircraft to meet our needs and move our organization forward, into the future,” remarked Andrea Robertson, president and CEO of STARS.

An independent review of the long-term sustainability of STARS indicated a move from a fleet of two aircraft to one type. This means that the AgustaWestland AW139 is also being replaced by the H145. This fleet renewal will help ensure that STARS continues to operate safely and control costs of overall operations.

Airbus Helicopters Canada president and COO Dwayne Charette, was also in attendance for the H145 welcome ceremony. During his speech, Charette hailed STARS’ decision to buy the H145, and put its faith in the new aircraft.

“By choosing the H145, you have chosen one of the most reliable and flexible aircraft of its type; easily adaptable for any mission,” he said.

Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe outlined the importance of STARS, and its ability to carry out its mission in Saskatchewan. “STARS has proven itself time and time again, providing rapid response to our families during medical emergencies, right across this province.”

Moe was fortunate to fly in on the H145 as a passenger, and before its arrival at the Saskatoon base, the new aircraft landed on the new helipad at the new Jim Pattison Children’s Hospital. Further tying into being based in Saskatchewan, the last three letters of the civil identity, LLS, stands for “land of living skies,” the province’s motto.

The fleet renewal will bring in a total of nine H145s, serving STARS bases in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Total cost for the renewal is being covered through private donations, corporate sponsorship and funding from the provincial governments of each province.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999690055847168}",neutral,0.9999690055847168,0
