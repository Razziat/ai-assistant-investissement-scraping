The cold heart that powers our ZEROe aircraft - Airbus,"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTExLXRoZS1jb2xkLWhlYXJ0LXRoYXQtcG93ZXJzLW91ci16ZXJvZS1haXJjcmFmdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hydrogen is key to our mission to bring zero-emissions aircraft to market by 2035, but it needs to be stored at an exceptionally chilly -253°C. To use this technology means developing innovative cryogenic hydrogen storage tanks. Luckily, we have teams around our network with just the right set of skills to build them…

The Countdown to ZEROe: Episode 1: Tanks show more show less How does an aircraft fly using hydrogen? Whether hydrogen is burned directly or converted into electricity in fuel cells, it first needs to be safely stored at -253°! Find out how our teams in Toulouse, Nantes and Bremen are collaborating to design and manufacture innovative cryogenic storage that will enable hydrogen-powered flight.

We’re constantly looking to harness innovative technologies to help us achieve our goal of bringing zero-emissions aircraft to market by 2035. A fairly fundamental aspect of this is how we will power such an aircraft. As such, we’re putting a lot of effort into harnessing what we believe to be a very compelling option: hydrogen.

In its simplest terms, there are two main technologies that enable an aircraft to fly directly with hydrogen. You can power an engine with hydrogen combustion through modified gas turbine engines, and you can use hydrogen fuel cells to create electrical power. And you can deploy a hybrid approach that uses a mixture of both technologies.

But regardless of these options there is a constant at work: hydrogen has to be kept very cold. It needs to be stored at -253°C, and kept at that temperature consistently throughout the whole flight, even when the tanks are depleted.

Storage tanks for a hydrogen-powered aircraft are therefore an absolutely essential component, but they are completely different to those you might find on a traditional aircraft. We immediately recognised that getting these tanks right would be vital to the success of our ZEROe aircraft, so about 15 months ago we established Zero Emission Development Centres (ZEDCs) in Nantes, France, and Bremen, Germany, with the task of designing and manufacturing the hydrogen tanks, and set to work.



It’s a real testament to the teamwork across our sites to see this first tank being manufactured so quickly. We want to optimise the tank for greater efficiency and to further reduce its environmental footprint: after all, a zero-emission aircraft needs to be as close to zero emission as possible throughout its whole life cycle.

Chris Redfern, Head of Manufacturing, ZEROe Aircraft and Head of Propulsion Industrial Architect

Leveraging the expertise of our colleagues at the ZEDCs

We turned to our colleagues in Nantes and Bremen because they already had the skills that we needed to tackle this challenge. Bremen is close to Ariane Group and Airbus Defence and Space, with their experience working with hydrogen, and Nantes has considerable expertise with metallic structures. The tank is manufactured in Nantes, and the coldbox, which takes care of the gasification of the liquid hydrogen, is produced in Bremen.

This tank isn’t just innovative technically – it represents a departure from traditional processes. Embracing a dynamic and agile working methodology, the teams adopted a co-development approach where in order to progress quickly they accepted the need to innovate, test, fail fast, and adapt. In short, the teams get straight into manufacturing a prototype, which they test and learn from before developing an improved prototype, rather than spending a lot of time working on theoretical plans.

This speed is highlighted by the progress made at the site in Nantes, where the team took an empty warehouse and built the first cryogenic hydrogen tank ever produced at Airbus in a little over a year.



From design to testing, and beyond

The journey to bringing this new technology to market goes something like this:

Engineers design the cryogenic hydrogen tanks on software in Toulouse. These designs are passed onto the teams in Nantes and Bremen, who review them and explore the process for manufacture. Once the design is agreed, the first tank – which is tested with nitrogen, not hydrogen – is developed. This is where we are now.

The next step is to look at the prototype with a critical eye and ask what we can do better. The insights and testing data is collated and all of this information goes into the design for a second prototype, to be filled with hydrogen. We already have plenty of feedback and we’re looking in particular at maximising space, improving performance, and simplifying the manufacturing process. Work on the second tank is already underway and will take around another year to build and test.

The final objective is to have a tank ready to install in the A380 demonstrator by 2026-2028.

Chris Redfern, Head of Manufacturing, ZEROe Aircraft and Head of Propulsion Industrial Architect, commented: “It’s a real testament to the teamwork across our sites to see this first tank being manufactured so quickly. The agile methodology has delivered a great prototype and will help drive improvements in future iterations. We want to optimise the tank for greater efficiency and to further reduce its environmental footprint: after all, a zero-emission aircraft needs to be as close to zero emission as possible throughout its whole life cycle.”

We’ve shown how we are on our way to safely storing liquid hydrogen inside an aircraft. But what happens next? How do you harness it to power the aircraft? Our next episode will focus on fuel cells and how to convert hydrogen into electricity. Stay tuned!"

This partnership will help Airbus mature technologies associated with future hybrid-electric aircraft and will be detailed at the Airbus Summit taking place 30 November - 1 December.

As part of this partnership, Airbus’ and Renault Group’s engineering teams will join forces to mature technologies related to energy storage, which remains one of the main roadblocks for the development of long-range electric vehicles. The cooperation agreement will notably cover technology bricks related to energy management optimisation and battery weight improvement, and will look for the best pathways to move from current cell chemistries (advanced lithium-ion) to all solid-state designs which could double the energy density of batteries in the 2030 timeframe.

The joint work will also study the full lifecycle of future batteries, from production to recyclability, in order to prepare the industrialisation of these future battery designs while assessing their carbon footprint across their entire lifecycle.

“For the first time, two European leaders from different industries are sharing engineering knowledge to shape the future of hybrid-electric aircraft. Aviation is an extremely demanding field in terms of both safety and energy consumption, and so is the car industry. At Renault Group, our 10 years of experience in the electric vehicle value chain gives us some of the strongest feedback from the field and expertise in the performance of battery management systems. Driven by the same ambition to innovate and reduce the carbon footprint, our engineering teams are exchanging with those of Airbus to converge transversal technologies that will enable both hybrid aircraft to be operated and the vehicles of tomorrow to be developed,” said Gilles Le Borgne, EVP, Engineering, Renault Group.

“This cross-industry partnership with Renault Group will help us mature the next generation of batteries as part of Airbus’ electrification roadmap,” said Sabine Klauke, Airbus Chief Technical Officer. “Reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 is a unique challenge that requires cooperation across sectors, starting today. Bringing together Renault Group’s experience in electric vehicles with our own track record in electric flight demonstrators will allow us to accelerate the development of the disruptive technologies required for future hybrid aircraft architectures in the 2030s and beyond. It will also foster the emergence of common technical and regulatory standards in support of the clean mobility solutions needed to achieve our climate targets.”

Technological trends are moving in the same direction. Airbus and Renault Group’s cooperation on electrification will play an important role in bringing change to the transport landscape, successfully contributing to the ambition of net-zero emissions by 2050, of both the automotive and the aviation sector.

Airbus prepares for its first megawatt-class hydrogen fuel-cell engine flight-test demonstrator… - Airbus,"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTExLWFpcmJ1cy1wcmVwYXJlcy1mb3ItaXRzLWZpcnN0LW1lZ2F3YXR0LWNsYXNzLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWZ1ZWwtY2VsbC1lbmdpbmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hydrogen-powered fuel-cell engine architecture with cryogenic storage could feature in an all-new zero-emission aircraft which will enter service by 2035. Airbus is already well on track to design, build and demonstrate such a megawatt-class propulsion system, in under four years from now…

<br />

Two years ago, Airbus unveiled several possible aircraft concepts – known collectively as “ZEROe” – which are helping to define the world’s first zero-emission commercial airliner which could enter service by 2035. While these concepts explore various size categories, aerodynamic layouts and propulsion system architectures, they all have one thing in common: they are hydrogen-fuelled. Three of them have engines which use hydrogen combustion to drive their gas turbines – similar to the way that turbofans and turboprops burn kerosene today, but without the latter’s CO2 and particulate emissions.

Meanwhile, a fourth ZEROe concept aircraft, representing a high-wing 100-seat regional airliner, features six eight-bladed propellers attached to engine pods – a configuration recently patented by Airbus. While outwardly resembling turboprop powerplants, these pods actually contain hydrogen fuel cells which produce electricity as the result of an electro-chemical reaction to power electric motors. It is in this context that Airbus has been conducting feasibility studies and laboratory tests to realise a fully working megawatt-class fuel-cell engine and demonstrator which could be tested in flight by the middle of this decade – around 2026.

First announced publicly on 30th November this year at the Airbus Summit, the demonstrator will use Airbus’ multi-modal flight test platform – the iconic A380 MSN001. The aircraft will be modified externally to carry the fuel-cell engine pod, while inside the aircraft’s rear fuselage Airbus will install a unique cryogenic tank to contain the liquefied hydrogen.

How it works

For this proof-of-concept demonstrator, liquid hydrogen from the cryogenic tank is converted into a gaseous state. It is then distributed to the fuel cell via supply lines running from the tank and through an external ‘stub’ aerodynamic and load-bearing support structure to the engine pylon interface.

From there the gaseous hydrogen enters the fuel cell inside the pod, where dioxygen (O2) molecules are also supplied by a controlled flow of air – taken from the surrounding atmosphere. The resulting reaction inside the fuel cell produces direct electrical current (DC) which is subsequently converted into alternating current (AC) by the means of inverters. Electric motors near the front of the pod then convert the electrical power into mechanical power by communicating torque to a reduction gearbox. At the end of the propulsion chain the propeller provides the thrust. The thermal energy generated by the fuel cell needs to be conveyed by a liquid cooling system to heat exchangers where it is dissipated into the ambient air. Water is also produced as a byproduct of the electrochemical reaction which is expelled from an outlet at the back of the pod.

Modifying the A380

The A380 was the obvious choice as ‘host’ for the hydrogen fuel-cell engine demonstrator. “It has plenty of space internally – so there are no constraints in terms of accommodating everything we need, as well as the ability to test multiple configurations,” says Mathias Andriamisaina, Head of ZEROe Demonstrators and Tests at Airbus.

“In terms of aerodynamics, the A380 is a very stable aircraft. So the pod attached to the rear fuselage via the stub doesn’t pose much of an issue. Furthermore, the airflows from the pod and its propeller do not affect the airflow over A380’s tail surfaces,” he adds.

“With the A380 we also have an aircraft that’s already fully instrumented. The flight-test-instrumentation (FTI) is a big part of the project and can be a big driver in terms of cost and planning. So MSN001 was the perfect fit for us.”

The overall concept which the teams settled on was to make the minimum amount of structural modification inside the A380. “We are just reinforcing two frames of the fuselage and then fitting this stub externally. Then we are fitting a specially adapted pylon to attach the structure of the pod onto this stub. Overall it will be able to support high sustained static and dynamic loads,” he notes.

While most of the equipment is installed outside the aircraft, inside the aircraft there is what the team refers to as the “tent” – a 10m long, 4m wide housing with a parabolic cross-section, which will be crafted out of carbon fibre by an Airbus Atlantic team at the Technocentre de Nantes. Inside this structure can be housed up to four cryogenic tanks containing the liquid hydrogen. During flight tests, the actual air inside the tent will be at the same pressure as outside the aircraft. In other words, the equipment installed inside this tent will only ‘see’ the atmospheric unpressurised environment. This includes the hydrogen supply lines from the tank, which is routed directly from the tent to the stub (also made in Nantes) and then to the externally mounted pod (to be assembled at Airbus’ factory in St Eloi in Toulouse).

“Using this approach avoids the risk of any hydrogen entering into the A380’s main pressurised interior because all the hydrogen routings from the tank will also be located inside our protective tent environment. There are also emergency venting lines, so we can expel the hydrogen out of this emergency line if needed,” explains Mathias.

Other Airbus ‘firsts’

“Everything concerning the distribution centre and the motor controller unit are being produced internally – this is an ‘Airbus’ activity,” enthuses Mathias. “In addition, the propelling system and the gearbox associated and the pitch control is developed by our own Airbus Helicopters and Defence and Space colleagues. It’s the first time that Airbus is creating such an engine ourselves – it's a big challenge.”

Other firsts for Airbus’ include the adoption of a high-voltage distributed electrical architecture for up to 1,000 Volts DC and also the creation of a bespoke engine control system – this will translate the thrust commanded by the crew into the actual shaft power.

Next steps

Extensive ground testing activities are already well underway. Examples include the electrical benches, thermal management systems and several fuel-cell integration benches. From 2024 there will be additional integrated test benches such as: a fuel cell system integration bench featuring a 200kW fuel-cell stack and a climatic chamber; a functional integration bench (FIB) for the engine control system to validate real interfaces and actuators; and a Propeller Integration Bench (PIB). The latter will explore propeller pitch actuation gearbox integration, gearbox endurance, and partial blade-release tests.

In parallel, the newly developed power centres and power converters for the fuel cell flight demonstrator will be connected to the A380 “iron bird” test rig so as to integrate them with the legacy A380 ATA Chapter 24 hardware (electrical power).

Later that year there will also be an “iron pod”. This test rig will bring together for the first time various key ingredients: 800kW of fuel cell power to two electric motors; the motor control units; the gearbox; the new high-voltage electrical distribution and conversion system; a ‘flight’ air supply and the liquid cooling system.

By 2026, and all being well following the various integration bench tests, the teams will be able to test the entire system in the integrated test bench (ITB). This will comprise the flight-standard fuel cell pod, complete with all its various systems and of course the propeller. The ITB, which will be built in 2024, will be connected to the same flight test instrumentation as for the A380 MSN001 and there will also be a co-located control room for flight crew training.

“Between now and the flight tests in 2026 we have a lot of challenges ahead, not only in design for sure, but also in the testing!” declares Mathias."

Airbus A330MRTT completes first 100% SAF test flight on both engines - Airbus,"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0xMS1haXJidXMtYTMzMG1ydHQtY29tcGxldGVzLWZpcnN0LTEwMC1zYWYtdGVzdC1mbGlnaHQtb24tYm90aC1lbmdpbmVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Brize Norton, 18 November 2022 – The Royal Air Force, Airbus and other industry partners have carried out the world’s first 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) flight using an in-service military aircraft. It is also the first 100% SAF flight of any aircraft type carried out in UK airspace.

An RAF Voyager – the military variant of the Airbus A330 commercial jetliner - took to the skies above RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, England, on Wednesday powered completely by 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel on both engines, paving the way for a range of possibilities for the future of flying military aircraft.

The flight was a joint endeavour between the RAF, aircraft manufacturer Airbus, the UK Ministry of Defence’s Defence Equipment and Support agency, British aircraft leasing company AirTanker and engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, with the fuel supplied by Air bp.

Michael Schoellhorn, CEO of Airbus Defence and Space, said: “True to our purpose of 'pioneering aerospace', we have gladly supported the Royal Air Force on this landmark sustainable-fuel test flight. I commend our UK customer for this achievement which helps pave the way for a sustainable reduction of carbon emissions of our military aircraft fleets. Airbus engineers have made a significant contribution to this RAF mission by providing on-the-ground expertise in recent weeks and securing the necessary MoD military flight permits.”

Sustainable Aviation Fuel – which is made from waste-based sustainable feedstocks, in this case used cooking oil – reduces lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to the conventional fuel it replaces, lessens the RAF’s reliance on global supply chains and improves operational resilience by reducing the necessity for fuel resupplying.

As different approaches will suit different platforms and environments, a range of alternative fueloptions are being looked at to ensure the UK is at the forefront of this developing technology.

The 90-minute return flight from RAF Brize Norton, flown by a combined Airbus, RAF and Rolls-Royce flight-test crew, replicated an air-to-air refuelling sortie and was witnessed by senior RAF and industry representatives. The RAF said it demonstrated the potential for its future operational capability, ensuring the ability to contribute to UK defence wherever and whenever it was required.

Experimental test pilot and Captain of the flight, Jesus Ruiz, said: “From the crew perspective, the SAF operation was ‘transparent’, meaning that no differences were observed operationally. The Test Plan was exhaustive and robust and has allowed us to compare SAF with JET1 culminating in a flight without a single drop of fossil fuel. Teamwork was a key contributor, harmonsing experience from Airbus, Rolls-Royce and the RAF. We feel very proud to be a small part of this huge step for sustainable aviation.”

Both parties share a vision that SAF is a key solution to helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions of air travel. This collaboration aims to accelerate the aviation sector’s transition to SAF.

Neste and Airbus recognize that one of the biggest challenges in accelerating SAF use is the ramp-up of SAF production. This collaboration is laying the foundation for both Airbus and Neste to drive SAF development across the global aviation industry. It will allow the partners to explore business opportunities together and jointly promote the production and use of sustainable aviation fuel. The focus will be on the technical development of SAF, fuel approval and testing of current and future production technologies, and investigating how ""100% SAF"" use can be enabled.

“SAF is one of aerospace’s most promising decarbonisation solutions that can be used in both in-service aircraft fleets and those of tomorrow. We are honoured to be partnering with Neste to drive forward the development and uptake of SAF, to stimulate the creation of a commercially viable market for renewable aviation fuels,” says Julie Kitcher, EVP Communications and Corporate Affairs, Airbus.“All Airbus aircraft are already certified for flying with up to 50% SAF and this partnership will be instrumental to reaching certification for up to 100% SAF before the end of the decade.”

“Neste is at the forefront of accelerating the aviation sector’s journey to a more sustainable future. That journey requires cooperation across the industry’s value chain. This collaboration with Airbus connects a pioneer in the aerospace industry with a leader in renewable fuels. The combined knowledge and expertise of the companies will help advance the use and availability of SAF as a means of transitioning aviation towards more sustainable energy sources and reducing the climate impact of aviation,” said Thorsten Lange, Executive Vice President, Renewable Aviation at Neste.

This is the second collaboration between Airbus and the energy provider Neste after the ‘Emission and Climate Impact of Alternative Fuels’ (ECLIF3) exploration on SAF with German research centre DLR. With this MoU, Airbus and Neste will be further working on the technical aspects of the challenge to reach the 100% SAF certification.

The whole ecosystem is playing an essential role to ensure the increased uptake of SAF. Besides working on the technical aspects, Neste and Airbus will therefore investigate concrete SAF projects and business opportunities across the world with airlines and other stakeholders."

Artemis I successfully launched: Orion is heading to the Moon with Airbus' European Service Module! - Airbus,"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTExLWFydGVtaXMtaS1zdWNjZXNzZnVsbHktbGF1bmNoZWQtb3Jpb24taXMtaGVhZGluZy10by10aGUtbW9vbi13aXRoLWFpcmJ1c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Orion spacecraft has just begun its journey to the Moon on NASA’s Artemis I mission. What will happen during the flight, and what role does the European Service Module (ESM) play in this lunar odyssey?

The Artemis I mission will test the full Orion spacecraft in space for the first time. This mission is uncrewed and all systems will be pushed to their limits - vital for ensuring that crew members in future missions aboard the Orion capsule are safe.

The ESM was built by Airbus under contract to the European Space Agency (ESA). It serves as the Orion spacecraft’s main propulsion system, while also providing orbital manoeuvring and positioning control. Another important function of the ESM is providing the spacecraft’s crew with critical elements of life support – including water and oxygen – and it regulates thermal conditions aboard Orion.

Even before launch, the ESM took on various tasks, such as cooling of the spacecraft systems on the launch pad.

The mission: Minute by minute

Just 54 seconds after launch, the rocket – known by its formal designation as the Space Launch System (SLS) – reached supersonic speed. Eight minutes into the flight, Orion was separated from the rocket’s main stage, and the spacecraft reached zero-gravity while still attached to the cryogenic upper stage of the SLS.

At 18 minutes into the flight, it was time to switch on Orion’s power supply. The ESM’s distinctive four-wing solar array was deployed and the team awaited with baited breath to see the sensors go green, indicating all was OK.

After that, Orion travelled to a much higher orbit, going from a perigee of approximately 26 km to some 160 km. Around 90 minutes after launch, with the final upper stage engine ignition, the module was propelled towards lunar orbit. At this point, the solar panels were folded backwards by 35 degrees to reduce the loads generated by the ignition of the engine before separation of the rocket's upper stage.

Seven hours after launch, the solar panels will be placed in their final position to provide power to the Orion spacecraft. The panels generate 11 kilowatts (kW) of power, of which 1.3 kW is supplied to the ESM. 11kW is roughly equivalent to the consumption of 11 standard household vacuum cleaners. The ESM therefore requires about the same amount of energy as just one vacuum cleaner.

In addition to providing power, the ESM also regulates the temperature of the entire Orion spacecraft throughout the flight. Just like us on Earth, when exposed to shade, the spacecraft becomes particularly cold while when facing the sun, it gets extremely warm. Therefore, heating elements warm the shady side, while radiators give off heat to cool the sunny side.

A four-week flight

During the 25-day flight (25 days, 11 hours, 36 minutes), all systems will be tested extensively. Countless sensors and cameras will monitor changes and system functions throughout the mission.

Space is known to be an extremely hostile environment, which is why there is special focus on everything the future Orion crew will need to stay alive. Astronauts will fly around the Moon on the very next mission, Artemis II. For this to be approved, all life-support systems must be functioning properly and validated on the Artemis I flight. The Orion capsule on Artemis I is uncrewed, but mannequin ‘passengers’ record data on conditions for the future crew members.

The outbound trip to the Moon will take several days. Orion will fly about 62 miles (100 km) above the surface of the Moon, and then use the Moon’s gravitational force to propel Orion about 70,000 km beyond the Moon in lunar orbit. The spacecraft will stay in that orbit for approximately six days to collect data and allow mission controllers - including Airbus engineers who designed and built the ESM - to assess the performance of the spacecraft.

Before its return to Earth, Orion will perform another close flyby above the Moon’s surface to harness the Moon’s gravity to accelerate back towards Earth. The Orion astronaut capsule will then separate from the ESM to enter our planet’s atmosphere, travelling at 11 km per second. This will produce spacecraft temperatures of approximately 2,760 degrees Celsius. After this 25-day-long mission and a total distance travelled of more than 2 million km, the capsule will splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Baja California. The ESM will not return to Earth with Orion, but will burn up in a controlled manner in the Earth's atmosphere – having completed its vital role in preparing the way for the future exploration of space.

The DisruptiveLab will evaluate a new aerodynamic architecture intended to reduce fuel consumption, as well as pursuing the implementation of hybridisation with a fully parallel hybrid propulsion system that enables the battery to be recharged in-flight. The new demonstrator will take to the skies before the end of 2022 in order to begin flight testing and maturing these new technologies.

“The DisruptiveLab goes another step further in Airbus Helicopters' ambitious strategy to reduce the environmental impact of its helicopters and to lead the way towards a sustainable aerospace industry,"" said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters. “The innovative architecture and the fully parallel hybrid propulsion system could only really be tested on a brand new demonstrator in order to verify the combined impact in CO2 reduction which could be as much as 50 percent, ” he added.

The new architecture of the DisruptiveLab features an aerodynamic aluminium and composite fuselage, specifically designed to reduce drag and thus reduce fuel consumption. The blades are integrated into the rotor in a way that allows for a more compact rotor head which reduces drag and therefore improves energy efficiency while lowering the perceived noise level. Its lighter rear fuselage incorporates a streamlined Fenestron tail rotor that also contributes to improved performance.

The DisruptiveLab demonstrator is part of the French Council for Civil Aviation Research Conseil (CORAC)’s roadmap and has been partly financed by the French Civil Aviation Authority (DGAC) in the frame of the French Stimulus plan, which is part of the European Plan, Next Generation EU, and the France 2030 plan.

Airbus Helicopters’ strategy relies on demonstrators to test and mature new technology in an agile manner. The Company started work on its first demonstrator, the FlightLab, in 2020. The FlightLab uses an existing H130 platform and is mainly dedicated to researching and developing technologies related to enhanced autonomy and safety technobricks. On the other hand, the DisruptiveLab will focus on improving aircraft performance and reducing environmental footprint.

The last flight of a warrior: Airbus A400M MSN4 retires in Bremen - Airbus,"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTExLXRoZS1sYXN0LWZsaWdodC1vZi1hLXdhcnJpb3ItYWlyYnVzLWE0MDBtLW1zbjQtcmV0aXJlcy1pbi1icmVtZW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A400M MSN4´s life cycle comes to an end. With more than 2,000 flight hours, 1,000 flights and many missions and campaigns completed, the Airbus prototype known as `Grizzly 4´ among the team, returns to Bremen after nearly twelve years of pushing boundaries to develop A400M capabilities to its maximum.

With the pilots Michel Gagneux and Luis Daniel Sabariegos in the cockpit, the MSN4 performed its last flight to Bremen - number 1,000 and last one in its career - where it will be displayed from now on for a well-deserved retirement after nearly twelve years in service, and after its extraordinary contribution to the development of the A400M.

Since its first flight on 20 December 2010, the team behind the MSN4 has taken on every challenge along the way, and now faces its retirement with pride on how this aircraft helped reimagine the future of military operations, turning the A400M into the mature, reliable and modern aircraft it is today.

The Airbus A400M MSN4´s life cycle comes to an end. With more than 2,000 flight hours, 1,000 flights and many missions and campaigns completed, the Airbus prototype known as `Grizzly 4´ among the team, returns to Bremen after nearly twelve years of pushing boundaries to develop A400M capabilities to its maximum. <br />

`Grizzly 4´: The rise of a warrior

Airbus A400M MSN4 has been used for all kinds of test flight campaigns through the years to develop key capabilities such as Aerial Delivery, Low Level Flight or Air-to-Air Refuelling, among others. With around 200 flights and 500 flight hours inside the cockpit of the MSN4, Ignacio Lombo, Chief Test Pilot at Airbus Defence and Space, has been witness and contributor to the development of the A400M. “I will keep Grizzly 4 in my memory as a strong and robust beast. We have taken it to the limit in speed, Mach, altitude, load factor (g’s) and almost tore off its skin!”, he shared. “This aircraft has exceeded all expectations in all kinds of operations with superior performance”.

MSN4 has also been key in the development and certification of the Air-to-Air Refuelling (AAR) capability as it is crucial for A400M operators today to fly further and safer on their military operations, as well as being able to perfect combos with other military platforms.

César González was the Flight Test Engineer in charge of the development and certification flight test of AAR capability, both as tanker and as receiver: “MSN4 was our Aerial Refuelling workhorse, as it was the one where we tested receiver capabilities with tankers like A330 Voyager and C160 Transall. As a tanker, we used MSN4 to develop and certify pods refuelling with F18 receivers, Hose Drum Unit refuelling with F18s and A400M receivers, the Cargo Hold Tanks (CHT) and more recently, the Helicopter Aerial Refuelling capabilities with H225M Caracal”, he shared. “I feel particularly proud of the mission that first refuelled an A400M receiver (Grizzly 6) from an A400M tanker (Grizzly 4)”.

show more show less The Airbus A400M MSN4´s life cycle comes to an end. With more than 2,000 flight hours, 1,000 flights and many missions and campaigns completed, the Airbus prototype known as `Grizzly 4´ among the team, returns to Bremen after nearly twelve years of pushing boundaries to develop A400M capabilities to its maximum.

It is precisely the Air-to-Air refuelling capability that came to Lombo´s mind when asked about its most challenging experience with the MSN4 as a pilot. “If I had to choose, I would say Air-to-Air Refuelling as receiver was the most challenging one. There was a lot of work behind the development of this capability. Through different steps, we reached the Flight Control Laws to perform the receiver role in an easy way with respect to other platforms. As a pilot, it has been fantastic to fly on different Flight Control Laws and, step by step, we managed to reach the perfect manoeuvrability of the aircraft”.

The MSN4 has been the determinant for the development and certification for cargo and parachute drops - these being key capabilities for A400M operators today - as it was designed in such a way that the cargo hold was free of instrumentation and, therefore, fully usable for aerial delivery or additional fuel tanks (CHT). “I fondly recall the early days of aerial delivery tests where we went from the very start of single loads by gravity and extraction, towing of (large) parachutes at low level and high altitude, to dropping 25 tonnes of loads in a single sequential stick of extracted platforms, as well as air displays at some of the UK airshows”, recalled Simon Nicastro, A400M Flight & Integration Test Programme Manager at Airbus.

The A400M today excels in the parachuting role, as it is able to carry more paratroopers over a greater distance, a capability that reinforces the strategic value the A400M already offers to air force operators and society.

All in all, MSN4 has exceeded expectations. “Many challenging campaigns, many successful flights, many impressive achievements and few surprises”, Gonzalez added. However, Lombo pointed out that it was not always a walk in the park: “We also faced some difficulties during this journey, but working as a team, we overcame all of these until we reached the certification and qualification of all the capabilities that our customers needed. We are really proud to see the A400M utilised by our customers in real operations all over the world”, Lombo said.

More than 100 A400M aircraft are deployed today in 8 different countries and, as part of Airbus' compromise to a more sustainable military aviation, the MSN4 was also the first aircraft among the Military Air Systems unit to perform a first demo flight with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) last summer, guiding its successors into a cleaner future and helping to pave the way towards the decarbonisation of military aviation.

Bremen: Back to the beginning

The MSN4 is now back home in Bremen, where every A400M is born, with the `scars´ of all the battles it helped win during its remarkable career. “I will always keep this last flight in my memory. As the Captain, I speak on behalf of the team behind our dear friend Grizzly 4, and we want to thank this aircraft for the great times we have spent together”, Gagneux said. González shared the emotion: “I can't help feeling that Grizzly 4 is my prototype, my baby. I feel a bit sad, but also proud of the work we achieved together with the team. Godspeed, mate! Time for you to rest after an exciting journey!”.

The team that now welcomes the MSN4 in Bremen is excited about the months ahead. “We are happy to have the MSN4 back home after all these years and all that it helped accomplish for the A400M development. It is in good hands here, where we will get it ready for its next chapter”, said Marc Steckling, Head of Site in Bremen at Airbus Defence and Space.

Dennis Neumann, Head of A400M Industrial Programme in Bremen, and currently leading the project for the future of the MSN4, gave some hints on the future plans of the aircraft. “This project hits the heart of all of us here at the Bremen site”, he said. “Before being placed at its final location next to the Bremen Airport, where everyone landing in Bremen will see it, it will get a new coat of paint and be configured to host team meetings and workshops as well as be part of the official guided site tour”.

Bye-Bye Biomass: forest monitoring satellite departs for final testing before launch - Airbus,"Wed, 02 Nov 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0xMS1ieWUtYnllLWJpb21hc3MtZm9yZXN0LW1vbml0b3Jpbmctc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWRlcGFydHMtZm9yLWZpbmFs0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Stevenage, 02 November 2022 – Biomass, the European Space Agency’s (ESA) forest measuring satellite has left the Airbus Defence and Space site in Stevenage and is on its way to Toulouse for final testing ahead of launch.

The comprehensive environmental test programme for the spacecraft will include thermal vacuum tests, mechanical vibration, acoustic and electromagnetic compatibility testing to replicate the conditions during launch and the harsh environment in orbit.

Faced with production and manufacturing challenges caused by the pandemic, the team at Stevenage has successfully completed the mechanical and electrical integration and testing of the spacecraft’s propulsion system, harness and all avionics equipment. The team has also attached and completed deployment testing of the large deployable reflector and integrated the radar instrument within the satellite, finalising the mechanical completion of the spacecraft.

Richard Franklin, Managing Director of Airbus Defence and Space UK said: “Biomass will be able to measure the world’s forests on a global scale – a true world first. It will give scientists vital information about just how much carbon is locked up and also being absorbed by the “lungs” of the planet enabling better decisions to be made on tackling climate change. This latest milestone builds on the successes of the previous ESA missions Sentinel-5P and Aeolus, confirming Airbus as a leader in Earth observation and environmental monitoring satellite manufacturing.”

Dr Paul Bate, CEO of the UK Space Agency said:“It’s exciting to see ESA’s forest mission, Biomass, built with backing from the UK Space Agency, setting off to prepare for its mission. It’s the first satellite capable of studying the world’s forests in three dimensions, providing valuable data on how they store carbon. With this information, organisations and authorities around the world will be able to measure key changes in our forests, predict what the impact will be, and take early action to prepare for, or even correct, that, as well as work towards critical net zero targets. This is a ground-breaking programme made possible by UK expertise in Earth observation science and we are proud to be a part of it.”

ESA’s flagship Earth Explorer mission will measure forest biomass to assess terrestrial carbon stocks and fluxes at an altitude of 600km above the Earth. The spacecraft will carry the first space-borne P-band synthetic aperture radar, delivering exceptionally accurate maps of tropical, temperate and boreal forest biomass that are not obtainable by ground measurement techniques.

Twenty engineers from the UK based team will lead the test campaign in Toulouse, supported by colleagues on site and from Airbus in Friedrichshafen.

Alongside testing, the UK team will prepare for the in-orbit commissioning and operational phases, with a separate team managing the delivery of the ground calibration transponder, located in New Norcia, Australia.

Biomass is set to launch from Kourou, French Guiana on a Vega rocket in 2024, and is scheduled to operate for five years.

Clean Aviation SWITCH Project to Advance Hybrid-Electric and Water Enhanced Turbofan Technologies - Airbus,"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0xMS1jbGVhbi1hdmlhdGlvbi1zd2l0Y2gtcHJvamVjdC10by1hZHZhbmNlLWh5YnJpZC1lbGVjdHJpYy1hbmQtd2F0ZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 29 November 2022– A group of aerospace technology companies have announced the formation of a collaborative consortium to develop hybrid-electric and water-enhanced turbofan technology for future aircraft propulsion systems, supported by the European Union Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking (Clean Aviation). MTU Aero Engines AG (MTU), Pratt & Whitney, Collins Aerospace (Collins), GKN Aerospace, Airbus and others aim to demonstrate the potential of these technologies to improve fuel efficiency and reduce aircraft CO 2 emissions by up to 25% compared to today's state-of-the-art propulsion systems for short- and medium-range aircraft. The consortium is coordinated by MTU.

The Sustainable Water-Injecting Turbofan Comprising Hybrid-Electrics (SWITCH) project is focused on developing a novel propulsion concept built from two revolutionary and synergetic technologies: Water Enhanced Turbofan (WET) and hybrid-electric propulsion. By combining these technologies with Pratt & Whitney’s GTFTM engine architecture, the SWITCH concept aims to significantly enhance efficiency and substantially reduce emissions across the full operating envelope of an aircraft. Technologies developed as part of SWITCH will be fully compatible with cleaner alternative fuels – such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) — and will be evaluated for future use with hydrogen.

“This highly impactful SWITCH consortium provides a unique opportunity to demonstrate the benefits of both WET and hybrid-electric propulsion technologies, not only independently, but as parts of a system,” said Dr. Stefan Weber, senior vice president, Engineering and Technology, at MTU. “WET offers considerable potential to boost efficiency and reduce all emissions significantly for future aircraft propulsion systems, whether they are powered by conventional kerosene, SAF, or even hydrogen. Since the concept is gas turbine based, the WET concept fully leverages MTU’s expertise.”

The hybrid-electric GTF powertrain will enable even greater efficiency across all phases of flight by leveraging highly efficient megawatt class electric motor generators, power electronics, and batteries to optimize the performance of the fuel-burning gas turbine. The WET concept recovers water vapor from the engine exhaust and re-injects it into the combustion chamber to significantly improve fuel efficiency, reduce NOx emissions, and lessen contrail forming emissions. These revolutionary technologies are designed to work together to deliver a step change reduction in emissions and energy use across the full operating system, while maintaining world class reliability and operability.

“This project will enable us to advance several key technologies on our roadmap to further extend the efficiency of the GTF engine architecture,” said Geoff Hunt, senior vice president, Engineering and Technology, at Pratt & Whitney. “Given the challenge of reducing the environmental impact of aviation, cross-industry collaboration and public-private partnerships like Clean Aviation will play a vital role in delivering the technology breakthroughs needed to make net zero emissions aviation a reality.”

Airbus will provide key expertise relating to the future integration of SWITCH technologies at the aircraft-level and will support the evaluation of performance benefits including aircraft design and integration of battery and energy management systems. “New propulsion technologies will play an important role in achieving aviation's net-zero goals, along with new aircraft designs and sustainable energy sources,” said Sabine Klauke, chief technology officer at Airbus. “We welcome this opportunity to collaborate and progress research into the next generation of advanced powertrain concepts.”

Collins will provide megawatt-class electric motor generators and power electronics, high-voltage DC distribution and protection, thermal management components and nacelle architectures for the project. “Hybrid-electric propulsion technology is a key enabler for increased efficiency across multiple different aircraft applications, from advanced air mobility to commercial airliners,” said Mauro Atalla, senior vice president, Engineering & Technology for Collins Aerospace. “Working with Clean Aviation and the SWITCH consortium, we will accelerate the development of these critical technologies from our state-of-the-art facilities in France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and the UK.”

GKN Aerospace will develop various engine structures with all-new functionalities, such as integrated electric machines and heat exchangers. “We are delighted to be collaborating in the SWITCH project and help address many exciting opportunities and challenges around thermal and electrical power management within a highly advanced propulsion system,” said Henrik Runnemalm, vice president, Global Technology Center, Sweden, at GKN Aerospace. “We will leverage our unique hot test rig in Trollhättan, Sweden, as well as our high voltage electrical wiring developed by our GKN Fokker business in the Netherlands.”

Current funding for Phase 1 of SWITCH extends to 2025 and will include testing of a hybrid-electric GTF engine, WET technology and sub-system laboratory testing, and design activity around an integrated hybrid-electric and WET cycle propulsion system. Subject to successful testing of these key technologies and component designs, further phases of ground testing and flight tests are expected to follow.

Clean Aviation is a public-private partnership co-funded by the European Union between the European Commission, the aerospace industry, and research institutes, dedicated to advancing transformational aircraft technologies which will help enable net zero emissions for aviation by 2050. The project will be supported by UK Research and Innovation, and will leverage collaboration between multiple aerospace companies, universities and research organizations across 11 countries in Europe and the United States.

"End-of-life Reusing, recycling, rethinking | FAST Online | News - Airbus Aircraft","Mon, 07 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vYWlyY3JhZnQuYWlyYnVzLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzcm9vbS9uZXdzLzIwMjItMTEtZW5kLW9mLWxpZmUtcmV1c2luZy1yZWN5Y2xpbmctcmV0aGlua2luZ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Have you ever wondered how much recycled material is used in the building of Airbus aircraft and how much of the aircraft can be recycled?

Reusing and recycling have been part of this industry for years. However, with today’s spotlight firmly focussed on sustainability, aviation must deliver noticeable results, show engagement and sometimes even completely rethink materials and ways of working.

What options should operators consider today for an aircraft at the end of its flying life, and what is around the corner for becoming even more sustainable?

Why managing end-of-life makes sense

Operators have several options when considering the next steps for an aircraft.

One of these is to extend the flight hours or cycles limit of the aircraft thanks to “extended service goal” upgrades.

https://aircraft.airbus.com/en/services/enhance/systems-and-airframe-upgrades/operations-extension

Alternatively, reusing parts from an aircraft or recycling materials both offer financial benefits. There is still significant value in an aircraft’s components and its metallic materials, even at the end of its life. So it makes financial sense for operators.

Aircraft can also be repurposed for training, or even showcased in a museum.

It is the owner’s corporate social responsibility to properly manage the end-of-life of their aircraft.

Ensuring used parts are safe and certified

An aircraft owner might already be sourcing Used Serviceable Material (USM). This can be an efficient alternative to new parts, in particular during times of tension in the supply chain.

But the aircraft owner can also source USM from their decommissioned aircraft and use them after repair and recertification. They can sell these parts to a broker or a material expert like Satair.

Nicolai Hertz, Head of Used Serviceable Material at Satair*, talks about USM from the customer’s perspective.

Q1: As a customer, what should I be looking out for when considering used serviceable material?



When buying USM it is essential to ensure that you are getting the right release certifications. These may be EASA, FAA, DUAL RELEASE, or any certification required, based on the origin of the previous customer. In addition, you need to obtain the proper shop reports from approved repair shops, proper traceability, and in many cases a Non-Incident Statement (NIS). All of this should of course be coming from a trustworthy, reliable and reputed provider to ensure that documentation is authentic and safety requirements are met.

Q2: What do customers expect when buying used serviceable material?

As with any purchase, customers expect a smooth buying experience with competent service from the provider. This means getting quality USM with full traceability and all the required certifications.

Sourcing new parts in 2022 has become a real challenge due to raw material and transport shortages, plus rising energy prices. This means that longer lead times for repairs and new material continue to affect customers, who then choose to look for alternative options to secure their material needs. As a result, the demand for USM is increasing, particularly within the single-aisle market as buyers seek to satisfy their demand for low-cost, USM options and increasingly see it as a viable option to support deferred engine maintenance post-covid.

*Satair: An Airbus subsidiary, providing material management and service needs for the civil aerospace industry. https://www.satair.com/

What is recyclable?

Once the owner has decided to phase out an aircraft, a specialised company needs to decommission it. This involves aircraft owners, brokers, MROs, dismantlers and recyclers.

The first steps will be to remove the valuable components selected by the owner which can be repaired, overhauled and recertified in order to fly again as Used Serviceable Material (USM).

By “recycling” in this article, we refer to what can actually be recuperated back to raw material and transformed for other uses. Recycling an aircraft requires expertise not only about the aircraft, but about the rules and regulations in force as well as safety considerations for handlers and the environment.

Alexandre Brun, CEO Tarmac Aerosave* gives an insight into how it works and what can be recycled.

Q1: How does aircraft recycling work?

We have a recycling process that meets strict environmental regulations. First, the aircraft or engine equipment is removed by qualified personnel in accordance with the manufacturer's guide provided by the owner. Removed parts are then reconditioned and re-certified so they can be returned to the after-sales market.

Once all the requested equipment has been removed, we disassemble the aircraft, and remove all its components (electrical, hydraulic systems, etc.) to be able to start cutting up the fuselage without any risk. The windows, for example, are of interest to the interior design industry, while the plastic elements are used to create clothing or fleece blankets.

This way, 92% of an aircraft's total weight and more than 99% of its engine parts (CFM) is recycled by Tarmac Aerosave. In the case of A320 aircraft, 92% of the total weight of the aircraft is recovered. The A320’s airframe is composed mainly of aluminum and alu-Li alloys (72%) steel (9%) and titanium (6%). All these metals are recycled at the end of the aircraft’s life. They will be valorised by specialised channels and once melted will be used to form new parts for non-aeronautical applications.

Composites and other materials can be used for energy recovery or disposed of in compliance with local regulations.

Material Breakdown of an A320

Q2: What are some of the challenges of recycling?

Airframe disposal requires processes to be respected, careful handling, and precise documentation.

There must be, for example:



- a process which is fully compliant with strict European legislation,

- traceability of removed parts,

- ISO 14001 and EN 9110 certification,

- dedicated, waterproof recycling areas with a water collection and treatment system,

- a wire-saw cutting process avoiding hot points and mixing of materials,

- a secure handling process of cut parts, protecting handling workers,

- optimized sorting of all materials.

The challenges of recycling are now to remove barriers to enable the use of recycled materials in the production of new certified flying parts, to prepare the eco-system and to anticipate the recycling of tomorrow's waste, such as carbon composites.

*Tarmac Aerosave is an EASA and FAA Part-145 services company, dedicated to storage, maintenance and eco-recycling of aircraft and engines (CFM56 & Leap).

Airbus' role in the value chain

As an aircraft manufacturer and part of the value chain, Airbus promotes responsible capabilities and practices associated with the recycling of its aircraft, with particular focus on 3 areas:

Prevention. This covers avoiding degradation of end-of-life performance, encouraging incremental improvement and implementing eco-design principles.

Re-use. This means looking at improving repairability.



Recycling. This involves: improving traceability of substances and materials all along the product life cycle, contributing to the development of new recyclability channels and technologies, supporting the use of recycled aeronautical materials into new aircraft manufacturing developing upcycling and downcycling value chains with partners.



Continuing to drive recycling

Back in 2007, the Tarmac Aerosave company was created for sustainable dismantling of commercial aircraft. It was a result of the Airbus-coordinated PAMELA project (Process for Advanced Management of End-of-Life Aircraft).



More: https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/life/publicWebsite/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=2859

Airbus and Tarmac Aerosave are now looking at how to further increase the value of material at end-of-life with sorting into specific material classes. They are also working with the ecosystem to bring some materials back into the aerospace supply chain, as primary or secondary structures, while other materials will continue to feed the wider industrial market.

Composites

Meanwhile, materials have been evolving for the latest generation of aircraft with, for example, the introduction of composites. Indeed, the A350 is over 50% composite. Composites have contributed to improving aircraft performance thanks to their light weight. The next step is to look at recycling it.

In order to anticipate future end-of-life management of composite aircraft, Airbus initiated early 2022 a new European project, focusing on dismantling and recycling of large composite structures. HELACS (Holistic processes for the cost-effective and sustainable management of End of Life of Aircraft Composite Structures) comes under the Clean Sky project.

Second-life services in China

During their life aircraft undergo maintenance, upgrades, checks and maybe short or long-term pauses in operations. This is all before the final stage where end-of-life options need to be considered. Professional, quality aircraft care during any of these periods is essential, whether to ensure safe return to operations or to maximise end-of-life financial returns.

Regional lessors and operators of commercial aircraft in China and surrounding regions will be able to address their requests to a new set-up in China. The future Airbus Lifecycle Services (ALS) Centre will provide a wide range of second life services for commercial aircraft. The resulting Used Serviceable Material (used parts) will be sold and distributed by Airbus material management subsidiary Satair with priority given to lessors, airlines and worldwide MRO’s Brokers (USM).

Managing end-of-life makes sense, financially and environmentally, for both operators and manufacturers. However, ensuring it is managed safely and according to stringent industrial requirements can be more difficult. Operators requiring comprehensive services to meet their needs can turn to companies such as Tarmac Aerosave and Satair and, in the future, ALS in China.

Could hydrogen fuel-cell systems be the solution for emission-free aviation? - Airbus,"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTExLWNvdWxkLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWZ1ZWwtY2VsbC1zeXN0ZW1zLWJlLXRoZS1zb2x1dGlvbi1mb3ItZW1pc3Npb24tZnJlZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The holy grail of aircraft propulsion is to provide power without any emissions. One of the most promising candidates is the hydrogen fuel-cell. Here we explain how Airbus and its partners are helping to drive the technology forward to be ready for flight demonstrations.

ZEROe Fuel Cell engine Reveal

Fuel-cells – originally invented by Sir William Grove in 1838 – generate electricity very efficiently through an electrochemical reaction, rather than via combustion. They also differ from batteries since they require a continuous source of fuel and oxygen (usually from air), whereas in a battery the chemical energy comes from substances which are already present inside the battery. Fuel cells can therefore produce electricity continuously for as long as fuel and oxygen are supplied.

The most promising technology for mobile applications is called Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM). In this type of fuel-cell, hydrogen is used as the “fuel” to directly generate electricity. With this type of fuel cell the only by-products are heat and water.

Having this technology on board of an aircraft is particularly attractive since it does not generate CO2, NOx, and potentially forms no contrails, or very limited ones. In order to use this advantage to its full extent we need an electric-powered aircraft, and therefore sufficient fuel cell capacity on board to generate enough power at an acceptable weight level.

‘ Stacking’ fuel-cells for extra power

Because one single fuel cell is only a few millimetres thick and roughly the size of a letter envelope, it does not release much energy. Therefore, in order to realise sufficient power levels for use in an aircraft, hundreds of these fuel cells need to be electrically connected in series to form a “stack”. Subsequently, several such stacks are combined into multiple fuel cell “channels”. With this modular approach, the megawatt levels of power – which are needed for an electric aircraft – are achievable.

Partnering with automotive fuel-cell expert, Elring Klinger

While fuels cells themselves are already used in some automobiles, they do not fulfil the stringent requirements necessary for aeronautical use. Nevertheless, it made sense for Airbus to look towards the automotive industry for a prospective partner and provider, with whom to take fuels cells to the next level – to produce specially tailored fuel cell stacks and industrialise them for the aviation industry. The best partner it found was Elring Klinger, one of the leading providers of fuel cells in the automotive industry. In 2020, these two companies created a joint venture named “Aerostack”. Notably, Aerostack has also joined forces with other stakeholders, as well as those who are working on fuel-stack development as part of a German government supported project called H2Sky.

Understanding and tailoring fuels cells for aerospace use

Two years after Aerostack was formed, the collaborative work is well underway. The first prototype fuel cell stacks are already being evaluated by Airbus in Hamburg, where the teams are designing fuel cell systems, assembling and testing them.

“We are doing everything from scratch at quite an impressive speed,” enthuses Hauke Peer Lüdders, Head of Fuel-Cell propulsion systems for ZEROe Aircraft at Airbus. “We need to understand how fuel cell systems work and react. For that first step we are intentionally designing large ones to accommodate many sensors inside and allow us to analyse each equipment in the system, with good accessibility in order to tailor, test and fully understand the system behaviour,” he explains.

Design and testing the auxiliary system – an iterative process

Once the teams have tailored the entire fuel cell systems, it’s time to test them. First they need to make sure it is properly connected to the auxiliary system, the test bed, comprising hydrogen, nitrogen (for the tests only), coolant and air supplies – as well as a drainage outlet (for the derived water by-product). After the doors of the test bench are closed, the power is switched on and the process gets underway. Subsequently the teams can monitor – via special screens – the ongoing reaction, the production of by-products and of course the electrical power generated.

“We once experienced issues with the water management, so the drainage design is key,” notes Hauke. “It’s an iterative process, and it doesn’t always go the way we expected, so it brings useful learning opportunities which enable us to improve the process so that it becomes even more stable and robust.”

Hauke points out that what the teams are doing is also iterative in terms of the technology standards which Airbus and its partners are developing. “Even as these tests are progressing, the teams are also designing and developing the next-generation of fuel-cell stacks and systems. These will be more compact and more powerful, and which will lead to a version which can fly in Airbus’ planned ZEROe fuel-cell demonstrator.”

“In the end, it’s incredible what we have learnt in such a short timeframe! I couldn’t dream of a more exciting project to work on and I’m sure a lot in the team would say the same,” concludes Hauke."

The software solution immerses trainees within a virtual cockpit and coaches them on Airbus Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Lufthansa Group will be the launch customer for the new solution presented at EATS (European Airline Training Symposium) 2022 in Berlin.

With Virtual Reality, the VPT allows trainees to drill procedures repeatedly within a fully interactive cockpit. Trainees can act intuitively on each switch and lever, following the correct sequence whilst building their ‘muscle memory’ and procedural knowledge.

“As part of a unique partnership, training expertise will be mutually shared to provide an innovative, integrated pilot training approach”, says Gilad Scherpf, Head of Aviation Training Development Lufthansa Group. Airbus and Lufthansa Aviation Training will deliver state-of-the-art A320 procedure training for Lufthansa Group airlines across VR, PC, and iPad devices. “The resulting training enhancements will enable further use cases as well as regulatory acceptance. This will be based on the jointly gathered data while aiming at a trainee-centric, flexible solution to support key competencies”.

“Using our Virtual Procedure Trainer, pilots have demonstrably learnt procedures more effectively and efficiently, offering the potential to shorten their Type Rating course” says Fabrice Hamel, VP of Airbus Flight Operations & Training. “The new tool also offers much more flexibility because trainees can choose to train alone with an AI, or together online”.



VPT can be purchased stand-alone or with the MATe Suite (Airbus training solution for aircraft systems). It is available on PC-tethered Virtual Reality devices or flat-screen devices such as laptops and iPads.

As a global aerospace giant pioneering the future, Airbus is set to play a key role in the upcoming era of renewed exploration to the Moon and beyond, bringing together skills and technologies for this new space ecosystem.

Why do humans need to live and work on the Moon and how will this happen?

The motivation for exploring the Moon and travelling deeper into our solar system is similar to what inspired the early pioneers here on Earth: adventure, prestige, geopolitics, economic value and discovering new resources. Adding to the motivation today are more modern opportunities for innovation and the development of technologies.

show more show less We are at the dawn of a new era in space exploration on the Moon, one in which Airbus and Europe are partnering with NASA and the US. If we can establish a presence on the Moon, as the Artemis programme envisions, that achievement will not only broaden human understanding but unlock a wide range of innovation opportunities back home on Earth.



Alongside government spending on infrastructure and building blocks for cis-lunar space (which is defined as the area extending from Earth to just beyond the Moon's orbit), commercial enterprises are already investing to build viable businesses.

Our ambition at Airbus is to ultimately contribute to the full human experience in space, from low-Earth orbit to the Moon and beyond. It requires answers to the basic needs that humans and robots require as modern explorers: be it water to drink, food to eat, communications to keep in touch with Mother Earth, tools for ground-breaking science and discoveries, or a comfortable place to live, work and play for sustained periods in space.

Envisioning the future lunar architecture

Airbus teams are starting to work on such enabling building-blocks today, while also thinking creatively about how to maintain a significant role in future exploration – including defining and producing key elements of the lunar architecture.

This capability is underscored by the European Service Modules being built by Airbus for the next Orion spacecraft as Europe’s contribution through the European Space Agency, to NASA’s Artemis missions. The ESM provides the spacecraft’s crew with critical elements of life support, including water and oxygen and it regulates temperature aboard Orion. As importantly, the ESM serves as the Orion spacecraft’s main propulsion system, while also providing orbital manoeuvring and positioning control.

Looking beyond the ESM, we’re pursuing the Moonlight programme to build a business that is focused on providing lunar navigation and communications for both institutional and commercial users. This is led by our wholly-owned small satellite specialist, Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd., in partnership with the European Space Agency.



Under study: a lunar logistic lander and inter-orbital transporter

Airbus is developing a concept for a large multi-role logistic lander together with our partners at ESA. Designated Argonaut (also known as EL3 for European Large Logistics Lander), it will be capable of transporting up to 1.7 tonnes of cargo to any location on the lunar surface.

Separately, Airbus is working with the European Space Agency to look into the development of inter-orbital transportation vehicles and is a founding member of the Euro2Moon non-profit European platform to explore future uses of natural lunar resources and is working with space agencies around the world on various Moon missions.

Airbus doesn’t intend to go it alone. We bring together players from across the space ecosystem, working with the best people and technologies – including agencies and companies small and large – to add value to what’s next in Space: the global cis-lunar architecture of the future.

The investment will contribute to funding part of Carbon Engineering’s advanced direct air capture R&D technologies at the company’s Innovation Centre in Squamish, B.C., Canada.

“Carbon Engineering’s Direct Air Capture technology provides a scalable, affordable solution to decarbonize aviation,” said Daniel Friedmann, CEO, Carbon Engineering. “We are thankful to Airbus for taking action and continuing to lead the way by helping accelerate solutions for the industry and for the climate.”

“We are proud to be investing in Carbon Engineering, reaffirming our commitment to the use of direct air carbon capture as a two-fold solution for the decarbonisation of the aviation industry,” said Karine Guenan, VP ZEROe Ecosystem, Airbus.

DACC is a high-potential technology that involves capturing CO2 emissions directly from the air using high powered fans. Once removed from the air, the CO2 can be used to produce power-to-liquid Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) that is drop-in compatible with today’s aircraft.

As the aviation industry cannot capture all CO2 emissions released into the atmosphere at source, captured atmospheric CO2 can also be safely and permanently stored in geologic reservoirs. This latter carbon removal solution would allow the sector to extract the equivalent amount of emissions from its operations directly from the air, thereby counterbalancing residual emissions.

The investment in Carbon Engineering is a key part of Airbus’ global climate strategy, which encourages the development and deployment of direct air capture technology, among a number of technological pathways in support of the aviation industry’s decarbonisation ambitions. The transaction is also a key element of Airbus’ strategy to grow its contribution to the Canadian economy. Airbus supports the recently-launched Clean Technology Key Industrial Capability in Canada, under the Industrial and Technological Benefits Policy.

Airbus and Boeing Report October 2022 Commercial Aircraft Orders and Deliveries - Defense & Security Monitor,"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL2RzbS5mb3JlY2FzdGludGVybmF0aW9uYWwuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMTcvYWlyYnVzLWFuZC1ib2VpbmctcmVwb3J0LW9jdG9iZXItMjAyMi1jb21tZXJjaWFsLWFpcmNyYWZ0LW9yZGVycy1hbmQtZGVsaXZlcmllcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Both Companies Report Strong October Orders

by J. Kasper Oestergaard, European Correspondent, Forecast International.

Boeing and Airbus delivered 35 and 62 commercial jets in October 2022, compared to 27 and 36 deliveries, respectively, in the same month last year. Year to date, Boeing and Airbus have delivered 363 and 497 aircraft, compared to 268 and 460, respectively, in the first 10 months of 2021. So far this year, Boeing and Airbus are 95 and 37 deliveries ahead of last year’s totals, respectively.

Following a more-than-challenging 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2021 was a year of recovery for the two largest commercial plane makers. With the end of the year approaching, 2022 is set to be another year of recovery for the commercial aircraft manufacturing industry, despite supply chain challenges, macro-economic weakness, and the conflict in Ukraine. Boeing and Airbus still have a long way to go before deliveries are back to pre-pandemic levels, though.

For the full year 2021, Boeing delivered 340 aircraft, compared to 157 in 2020 and 380 in 2019. Boeing’s last “normal” year was 2018 – before COVID-19 and the 737 MAX grounding – when it delivered 806 jets, a level that will likely not be recaptured before 2025. The past three years have been extremely challenging for Boeing but, despite Dreamliner quality issues and 777X delays, the outlook is mostly bright. Dreamliner deliveries have resumed and the 737 MAX is approved to fly in nearly every country. The aircraft, however, has not yet returned to commercial service with Chinese airlines despite the fact that the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) ungrounded the 737 MAX in December of last year. On October 30, China Southern Airlines canceled two 737 MAX flights that would have marked the aircraft’s return to commercial service with Chinese airlines. On October 10, a Boeing 737 MAX flight by MIAT Mongolian Airlines landed in Guangzhou – the first commercial flight by the model to China since the aircraft’s grounding in March 2019. Earlier this year it was announced that Boeing will begin to remarket some 737 MAX jets earmarked for Chinese customers. Ongoing political tensions between the United States and China are impeding deliveries, and Boeing is facing perhaps its most difficult situation since entering the Chinese market half a century ago. Chinese airlines are no longer ordering its jets, and hundreds of new aircraft cannot be delivered to Chinese customers. On top of that, Boeing is stuck with a completions and delivery center in Zhoushan that it has no need for until the political situation improves. The Zhoushan plant was scaled to accommodate 100 aircraft annually.

In 2021, Airbus delivered 611 aircraft and won the deliveries crown for the third year in a row. Deliveries were up from 566 in 2020 but remain well below the company’s all-time record high of 863 shipments in 2019. Airbus is expected to retain the deliveries lead for the foreseeable future due to the company’s comfortable backlog lead over its American rival. Prior to 2019, Boeing had out-delivered Airbus every year since 2012.

As indicated above, in October 2022, Boeing delivered 35 jets, including 23 737s (22 MAX / 1 NG), one 747, four 767s, one 777, and six 787s. Since June of this year, the 737 program has been producing aircraft at an official monthly rate of 31 per month, up from 27. The rate of 27 per month was maintained between November 2021 and May 2022 and, prior to that, the monthly rate was just 19. Despite the recent 737 rate increase, ongoing supply chain issues are likely to persist for the time being. Boeing had been considering a boost in 737 production to 38 jets per month in the first half of 2023, followed by another increase to 47 jets per month by the end of 2023, but these plans have now been postponed. In connection with the release of Boeing’s second quarter 2022 earnings, President and CEO David Calhoun commented, “But I do believe we’re at a state now where at 31, we are comfortable the industry can get there and maybe has already gotten there, and then we are going to watch as they qualify more capacity going forward before we pull those rates up.” At present, Boeing’s main supply chain headache is its engine supply.

On August 10, deliveries of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner were resumed following a suspension of shipments that lasted nearly 16 months. Boeing suspended Dreamliner deliveries in May 2021 for the second time in less than a year. The current 787 production rate is two aircraft per month, and Boeing expects to continue at this rate for now but will likely return to five per month over time. In March of this year, it was reported that the company was testing the ability of suppliers to meet output scenarios as high as seven per month by the end of 2023.

The 777 program was expected to get a new addition in late 2023 with the first delivery of the 777X, but in April Boeing announced this will now not happen before 2025. This reflects an updated assessment of the time required to meet certification requirements. According to Boeing, the 777-9 production rate ramp-up is being adjusted to minimize inventory and the number of planes requiring “change incorporation,” including a temporary pause through 2023. However, Boeing is taking advantage of the adjustment to the 777-9 production schedule by adding 777 freighter capacity starting in late 2023. In January of this year, Boeing launched a new 777X-based freighter, thereby expanding its 777X and cargo portfolio. Qatar Airways will be the 777-8F launch customer.

In October 2022, Airbus delivered 62 jets, including five A220s, 47 A320s (all NEO), three A330s, and seven A350s. During 2021, Airbus steadily increased A320 production from 40 per month to 43 in Q3 2021 before finishing the year at a rate of 45 per month. Production will continue to be increased until reaching a monthly rate of 65 by early 2024 (recently pushed back from mid-2023 due to supply chain challenges). Also, Airbus is working with its supply chain to increase the A320 production rate to 75 aircraft per month in 2025. The newest A320 NEO family addition, the A321XLR, successfully accomplished its first flight on June 15, 2022. Entry into service, initially planned for the end of 2023, is now expected to take place in early 2024.

The A220, meanwhile, is being produced at a rate of six aircraft per month, up from five at the beginning of the year – with a monthly production rate of 14 envisioned by the middle of the decade. The A350 production rate currently averages five per month and was expected to be increased to six by early 2023. However, the rate increase will likely be delayed until the end of 2023 due to sanctions on Russia and a legal fight between Airbus and Qatar Airways over A350 paint/surface issues. Airbus is currently producing two A330s per month, a rate that is expected to be increased to nearly three aircraft by the end of 2022.

In 2021, Airbus launched the A350 freighter, or A350F, which is a major and much-needed boost to the company’s competitiveness in the cargo segment. Boeing has long dominated the cargo space with its 737-800BCF, 767-300BCF, 767-300F, 777F, 777-8F and 747-8F offerings. Until now, Airbus has only offered the A330-200F, which has not performed well in competition against Boeing’s popular 767-300F. With the launch of the A350F, it appears Airbus is getting serious about capturing more of the cargo aircraft market. The A350F, which carries up to 120 tons (109 metric tons) of cargo, received its first order in November of last year and will predominantly compete with the 777F and later the 777X freighter. In comparison, the 777F has a cargo capacity of up to 112 tons (102 metric tons). To date, the A350F has accumulated 31 net new orders.

Turning to the October orders review, Boeing had a strong month and booked orders from seven customers for a total of 122 jets. The company reported no cancellations in October. The largest order, for 42 737-10s and 10 737-9s, was placed by Alaska Airlines, followed by the order placed by International Airlines Group (IAG) – one of the world’s largest airline groups – which booked a total of 50 737-8-200s and 737-10s. Also in October, an undisclosed customer placed an order for 10 787-9 Dreamliners. Finally, Emirates booked five 777 freighters. Other customers ordered a total of four 737 MAXs and one 767-300F. Year to date, Boeing has accumulated 550 net new orders (664 gross orders). In 2021, Boeing booked 909 gross orders and received 430 cancellations, for a total of 479 net new orders (before ASC 606 changes). Please note that for comparison reasons, we do not include Boeing’s so-called ASC 606 accounting adjustments in the numbers reported in this article and regard net new orders as gross orders minus cancellations.

In October, Airbus booked 177 orders from five different customers and reported 14 cancellations (11 A320neos and three A321neos). IAG ordered 31 A320neos and 28 A321neos, followed by Xiamen Airlines, which booked 25 A320neos and 15 A321neos. Also in October, Jet2 plc ordered 35 A320neos, while an undisclosed customer booked 28 A321neos. Finally, Air Canada ordered 15 A220-300s. Year to date, Airbus has accumulated 810 net new orders (1,033 gross orders), surpassing both 2021 gross orders and net new orders. In 2021, Airbus booked a total of 771 gross orders and received 264 cancellations, for a total of 507 net new orders – enough to win the orders crown for the third year in a row. It should be noted, however, that if Boeing’s 2021 ASC 606 adjustments were included, Boeing would have come out ahead with 535 net new orders.

At the end of October 2022, Airbus reported a backlog of 7,397 jets, of which 6,772, or 92 percent, were A220 and A320ceo/neo family narrowbodies. This is 328 aircraft below the company’s all-time backlog record of 7,725 aircraft set in January 2020. By the end of October, Boeing’s backlog (total unfilled orders before ASC 606 adjustment) was 5,323 aircraft, of which 4,277, or 80 percent, were 737 NG/MAX narrowbody jets. Boeing’s all-time backlog high of 5,964 aircraft was set in August 2018. The number of Airbus aircraft to be built and delivered represents 8.6 years of shipments at the 2019 production level (the pre-pandemic level), or 12.1 years based on the 2021 total. In comparison, Boeing’s backlog would “only” last 6.6 years at the 2018 level (the most recent “normal” year for Boeing), or 15.7 years based on 2021 deliveries. In 2022 to date, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio, calculated as net new orders divided by deliveries, is 1.52. Airbus’ book-to-bill ratio is 1.63. In 2021, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio was 1.41, while Airbus reported a book-to-bill of 0.81.

2022 Forecast

Forecast International’s Platinum Forecast System is a breakthrough in forecasting technology that provides 15-year production forecasts. The author has used the Platinum Forecast System to retrieve the latest delivery forecast data from the Civil Aircraft Forecast product. For 2022, Forecast International’s analysts currently expect Boeing and Airbus to deliver 407 and 668 commercial jets, respectively. Compared to the 2021 level, this is a 19.7 percent increase for Boeing and a 9.3 percent increase for Airbus. Please note these figures exclude militarized variants of commercial platforms such as Boeing’s P-8 Poseidon and KC-46 Pegasus and Airbus’ A330 MRTT tanker.

Boeing released third quarter 2022 results on October 26 and now expects to deliver 375 737 MAX jets, down from its previous guidance in the low 400s. Airbus released Q3 2022 earnings on October 28 and maintained its target of 700 commercial aircraft deliveries this year. This means that Airbus expects to deliver as many as 203 aircraft in total in November and December, which is quite ambitious. However, from 2017-19, Airbus managed to do just that – delivering 201 aircraft in November-December 2017 and 216 in the last two months of both 2018 and 2019.

Nov. 14, 2022, © Leeham News: Boeing’s decision to suspend the launch of any new airplane until the middle of the next decade means innovation of any kind from any company is largely dead for the next decade.

Airbus won’t launch a new airplane either, now that Boeing has stood down, says its former chief strategic officer, Kiran Rao. Rao is now an advisor to airlines and lessors. He had been with Airbus for 25 years in sales and product strategy.

While Boeing’s decision to suspend new airplane development casts a dark cloud over its strategic future, Airbus now is going to rest on its own status quo, Rao said.

Airbus and ArianeGroup sign Ariane 6 transition batch contract in Spain - Airbus,"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0xMS1haXJidXMtYW5kLWFyaWFuZWdyb3VwLXNpZ24tYXJpYW5lLTYtdHJhbnNpdGlvbi1iYXRjaC1jb250cmFjdC1pbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus and ArianeGroup have signed a contract for the next transition batch of Ariane 6 large carbon fibre structures. The contract includes the manufacturing and supply of innovative, large, lightweight structures for the next fourteen Ariane 6 launchers, to be manufactured until 2025. The contract will support ArianeGroup's ramp up to full production rate by then.

Airbus builds up to four carbon fibre structures for each Ariane launcher at its Getafe site, near Madrid. The new state-of-the-art 4.0 industrial facility includes a dedicated manufacturing and assembly line for the Ariane 6 launcher structures. The latest technology innovations have resulted in a reduced mass while delivering a stronger structure in a single piece at a lower cost. The Interface Structure (upper and lower) is the largest space carbon fibre structure ever produced in Europe. The other structures include the Launch Vehicle Adapter, for the upper stage; and the Equipped Solid Rocket upper part of each rocket booster.

“Signing this contract is a significant step forward, not only for Airbus and its launcher activities in Spain, but for the overall Ariane 6 programme,” said Luis Guerra, head of Space Systems in Airbus in Spain. “It demonstrates that Spanish participation is key to the future of Ariane 6 and what is next in space for Europe.”

“Following the signature of the exploitation contracts with Sabca, Europropulsion, Avio and MTAerospace, this contract with Airbus is a new and key step towards a strong Ariane 6 European team” said Stephane Nogatchewsky, Head of Procurement of ArianeGroup. “While the inaugural flight of Ariane 6 is getting closer and the industrial ramp up is intensifying, this collaboration is a positive and critical milestone for the future of Ariane 6 operations. Also, unifying European actors is paramount to ensure further Ariane 6 industrial robustness, competitiveness and preserve European autonomous access to space.”

The Ariane 6 programme is the only European asset that allows independent access to space for strategic missions, and the flexibility to launch both heavy and light payloads to a wide range of orbits for applications such as Earth observation, telecommunication, meteorology, science and navigation.

"Airbus Prepares For Much Higher A220 Rates, New Versions - Aviation Week","Mon, 14 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9zcGVjaWFsLXRvcGljcy9jcm9zc292ZXItbmFycm93Ym9keS1qZXRzL2FpcmJ1cy1wcmVwYXJlcy1tdWNoLWhpZ2hlci1hMjIwLXJhdGVzLW5ldy12ZXJzaW9uc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In the narrowbody market, the unbalanced competitive landscape between the Airbus A320neo and the Boeing 737 MAX families is currently very much in the foreground. As the Airbus A220 program is grabbing less attention, the multinational OEM is now laying the groundwork for the A220 to be able to step up and make Boeing’s position even more defensive.

Often ridiculed as a “nice little aircraft” by former Airbus Chief Commercial Officer John Leahy, the former Bombardier C Series program had been seen internally as a serious competitive threat to the A320 family and was the main reason behind Airbus’ decision to launch the reengined A320neo in 2010. When it became clear that Bombardier could no longer afford to maintain the program, Airbus acquired the former C Series in 2018, in what was seen as a clever strategic play by then-CEO Tom Enders. Airbus killed several birds with one stone: Taking control prevented a possible sale to China or Boeing, and the new aircraft type would open up new possibilities of attacking the 737 MAX from the lower end of the market.

Airbus puts in place the basis for increased A220 production

Long-range and stretched versions are on the horizon

A220 could move up to compete in the A320neo and Boeing 737-8 market segment

But first, the program needed to be fixed.

Because of the high-risk competitive position of the C Series and the relatively low expected volumes, Bombardier had to agree to highly disadvantageous contracts with its major suppliers. Not only was the pricing much worse than that of any Boeing or Airbus program but Bombardier also outsourced much more aerostructure work in comparison with Airbus. After the takeover, Airbus set a target of reducing supplier costs by about 20%, and the company is still working toward that goal.

At the same time, production is set to more than double over the next three years. The three final assembly lines (FAL) in Mirabel, Canada, and Mobile, Alabama, are currently at a nominal production rate of six aircraft per month. Airbus plans to increase that rate by 2025 to a combined 14 aircraft, 10 of which are to be built on the two parallel lines in Mirabel. Also in 2025, the aircraft program is expected to reach an operating profit for the first time. Once that milestone is in sight, Airbus will look at the next potential steps—longer ranges and a stretched version that would essentially match the size of a 737-8 or A320neo.

Before Airbus takes those next steps, however, it is putting new structures in place—both in its relationship with suppliers and industrially.

“We are where we should be today,” says Airbus Canada CEO Benoit Schultz, referring to the renegotiated supplier deals. “Competitiveness of the supply chain is key, particularly at high rates.” He also indicates that Airbus is not going to stop at the initial 20% reduction target: “Tomorrow there is a need for more [reductions].”

Due to its Bombardier legacy, most of the A220’s aerostructure components are outsourced. For example, Spirit Aerosystems is building the wings and mid-fuselage; Stelia Aerospace (now Airbus Atlantic) is in charge of the cockpit and aft fuselage; Avic’s Shenyang Aircraft Corp. is building the forward, mid and aft fuselage sections as well as the doors and tailcone; and Aernnova Aerospace has a contract for the center wing box and tailcone. Some components are dual-source; others are not.

Although derisking is an important target, Schultz does not see “a need for radical change.” That also holds true for the large share that is placed into Avic Shenyang, which is delivering components “on time and on quality,” he says.

The same cannot be said for all component providers, and it shows in A220 deliveries. Airbus handed over a total of 39 A220s—six of which were A220-100s—in the first 10 months of the year, averaging less than four aircraft per month. More specifically, no aircraft were delivered in August, four were delivered in September and five in October.

“The line is at rate 6, but deliveries are not linear,” Schultz says. As a result, Airbus Canada continues to experience “some level of perturbation that has to do with the supply chain. We have adapted our plan tactically in line with suppliers.”

Schultz adds that there is not just one root cause or a systemic reason for the supply chain woes. The A220 program is “exposed to outstanding work”—meaning work that has not been completed where it should be—and Schultz expects that problem to persist “well into 2023.”

Like Airbus as a whole, the OEM’s Canadian subsidiary has started to increase the level of strategic buffer it has on hand to handle irregularities. The company is also implementing value stream management (VSM) more deeply as a steering principle in production to optimize the process. The unit has named Ivan Martinez as A220 head of VSM, reporting to Schultz and Chief Operating Officer Alberto Gutierrez.

Internally, Airbus Canada has also implemented major changes in the final assembly flow. It introduced a so-called pre-FAL in a hangar formerly used for the Bombardier CRJ program. The main idea of the rearrangement is to move system installation upstream in the process. The pre-FAL is a U-shape tacted line currently operating at rate 6. The equipped fuselage sections are then either moved to the local FAL in Mirabel or trucked to Mobile.

“This adds a layer of protection for the FAL,” says Daniel Wenniger, head of the A220 program office. “It started in January, and we can already see the benefits. We have a lot of stability.” If the process is disrupted, allowing some traveled work into the actual FAL is then less of an issue because the normal process is already more straightforward. In the pre-FAL, four stations are used for preparatory work and seven for the actual equipping.

The same work had previously been performed at temporary stations inside the FAL building, where there were constraints on space and customization was done very much downstream. The arrangement worked for the low production rates of two or three aircraft per month—the rate at which the program had operated initially and during the novel coronavirus pandemic—but that level of production would not suffice for the planned growth. “It allows a perfect industrial flow,” Wenniger says.

“The pre-FAL is a very important step for our rate capabilities,” Schultz says. “The more you can move upstream, the better for the process. We are taking advantage of the Airbus experience.”

The expanded industrial capabilities form the basis for Airbus to spool up deliveries as planned. The manufacturer has so far collected 788 firm orders for the A220, 692 of which are for the A220-300. By the end of October, 232 aircraft had been delivered. The production backlog is heavily tilted in favor of the A220-300; only 40 orders remain for the smaller and less economical -100.

Airbus has made clear several times that a further stretch of the aircraft is “a question of when, not if,” as Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer once put it. The exact timing has to do with several factors. For one, the company aims to gear up production first and make the program profitable before tasking the organization with another development program that will require more investment. The other elements taken into account are the competitive play against Boeing and, unfortunately for Airbus, the A320neo.

The A220-300 is currently certified for up to 150 seats, but Airbus is working on raising capacity to 160 passengers. A stretched version would safely move the aircraft into the A320neo and 737-8 territory of about 180 seats, presumably with much better economics. While Airbus might be tempted to launch the version early to target the most successful version of the 737 MAX family, it must also take into account the likely effect on sales of the highly profitable A320neo. The A320neo program is becoming “a very A321neo-centered family,” Schultz says. In fact, Airbus has 2,387 outstanding orders for the A320neo but 3,734 for the A321neo.

An A220-500, launched around 2025 and put into service 3-4 years later, would likely be an acceptable risk to the A320neo backlog, particularly since Boeing has made clear it will not launch a new narrowbody until after 2030. “The aircraft has a lot of potential,” Schultz says, but he has not specified a timeline, except to say that “now is not the time [for a launch decision].”

The other likely development is a long-range version of the A220-300. Breeze Airways founder David Neeleman has been pitching the idea to Airbus for years, since the extended range would allow his airline to fly transatlantic routes with the A220. Airbus increased the range of the aircraft once, in 2019, by 450 nm, and the A220-300 can now fly up to 3,400 nm. Neeleman, however, wants it to be capable of flying 4,000 nm—the same range as the A321LR but less than the A321XLR (4,700 nm).

Airbus could take advantage of work already performed for the corporate jet version of the A220, launched in 2020 and equipped with auxiliary fuel tanks. Such an aircraft would take the idea of long-haul narrowbody flight one step further and allow airlines to open up even thinner routes—but Airbus needs to consider whether adding that capability to the A220 would cannibalize the lower end of the A321XLR market."

Construction of the hydrogen station at Toulouse-Blagnac airport was completed earlier this year and the production, storage and distribution systems are currently undergoing final testing. The station which is slated to enter-into service in early 2023 will have a capacity to produce around 400 kg of hydrogen per day, providing the possibility to power some 50 ground transportation vehicles.

Airbus is working with HyPort to put in place a deployment plan for the expansion of these hydrogen fuelled ground operations, adapting production and distribution means, as well as infrastructure capacity, to cope with the expected increase in hydrogen demand in the coming years. The partnership will also enable a blueprint to be prepared outlining requirements and providing guidance on safety of operations, regulatory compliance, social acceptance as well as the financial investment necessary for the widespread use of hydrogen at airports.

“Our involvement with HyPort demonstrates the tangible progress Airbus is making on its journey to secure the future energy ecosystems of tomorrow,” said Karine Guenan, VP ZEROe Ecosystem, Airbus. “Using hydrogen to decarbonise all airport-associated ground transport in the 2020 to 2030 timeframe will pave the way for hydrogen availability for zero-emission aircraft by 2035.”

In 2020, Airbus launched “Hydrogen Hub at Airports'' to help airports identify infrastructure requirements for future hydrogen aircraft, as well as low-carbon airport operations, across the entire value chain. Over the past two years, Airbus has signed partnerships with a variety of airport authorities, airlines and energy providers in Europe, Asia-Pacific and North America.

The partnership was announced during the Airbus Press Conference at the 14th China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition. With these agreements, Airbus and Airbus’ Chinese operators further support the green aviation strategy in China.

The SAF for the above mentioned commercial flights is produced locally from used cooking oil by SINOPEC Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Company, a state-owned manufacturer in China. The Chinese SAF made by the only certified Chinese facility is also used for delivery flights from Airbus Tianjin.

Since October 2022, Airbus Delivery Centre in Tianjin has offered customers the option of a five percent SAF fuel blend for all single-aisle A320neo Family and A350 wide-body aircraft delivery flights..

SAF is a sustainably-produced aviation fuel made from feedstocks ranging from used fat, oil and grease to municipal and forestry waste. Compared to fossil jet fuel, SAF has been demonstrated to result in an up to 80% reduction in CO 2 emissions across the entire SAF lifecycle. Therefore, it is considered as a key enabler to contribute to the decarbonization of aviation.

The 14th Five-Year Plan for the Green Development of Civil Aviation issued by CAAC states that it is necessary to implement a low-carbon development strategy, promote breakthroughs in the commercial application of SAF, and strive to achieve a SAF consumption of over 20,000 tonnes by 2025.

Xiamen Airlines has become the newest Airbus customer in China by placing a firm order for 40 A320neo family aircraft this September. Zhejiang Loong Airlines operates an Airbus passenger aircraft fleet made up of 64 A320 family aircraft. Colorful Guizhou Airlines has a fleet of 8 A320neo family aircraft.

When today’s kids come of age, our skies will look a lot different. For one thing, they may be filled with a multitude of planes that soar to new heights without any emissions. And the new fuels and technologies that could power them – from fuels made of algae and waste to hydrogen – are already in the works.

SAF is just one of the aerospace industry’s decarbonisation solutions that can be used in both in-service fleets today and the flying fleets of tomorrow.

So what is Sustainable Aviation Fuel? Why is it a better solution than fossil fuel? And how can these complex concepts be explained so that kids can understand them?

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel? show more show less Today’s jet fuel impacts the environment. A proven alternative fuel - named Sustainable Aviation Fuel - can reduce lifecycle CO2 emissions compared to conventional fuel. SAF is one of the aerospace industry’s best decarbonisation solutions which can help for the betterment of our planet. So what is sustainable aviation fuel?



The Airbus Foundation’s Discovery Space programme has set its sights on addressing those very questions with “Flying to a sustainable future”, the latest chapter of the “Future of the Skies” content series aimed at kids aged 8 to 12 years old. It includes the following:

Four animations that explain key topics using characters kids have already met from previous editions

2 activities - to be done alone or accompanied by an adult.

“Our aim is to provoke kids’ imaginations with content that gets them thinking about today’s critical challenges.” says Rachel Schroeder, Managing Director of the Airbus Foundation. “This new chapter highlights how advances in science can be explained with simple examples from everyday life. We think children will be motivated to pursue learning about science, the environment and climate change through such content.”

“Flying to a sustainable future”: Benefit starts today

SAF is another star of this content series. And for good reason: It gives an impressive reduction of up to 80% in carbon emissions over the lifecycle of the fuel compared to the traditional jet fuel it replaces, depending on the sustainable feedstock used, production method and the supply chain at the airport. It is a complement to Hydrogen.

Kids can also find interesting points to give free run to their imagination.

Each of the four episodes explains a key topic and inspires kids to think critically about them. These topics include the following:

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) : kids learn about the impact of today’s jet fuel on the environment. They also discover why alternative options, like SAF, are needed for the betterment of our planet. Then kids are challenged to think about things that could be used to produce SAF?

An existing solution : In the second episode, the kids learn how SAF can be used in current and future aircrafts. They are then encouraged to think about what could be changed about aircraft to make them friendlier for our planet?

Better Fuel : In this third episode, kids learn that, when an aircraft flies on fossil fuel, CO2 is released into the air. When it uses SAF, CO2 gets into the air too! So… Why is SAF better? Kids are then asked: Can you find something in your house that uses CO2 to grow?

Making SAF : This final episode outlines a way to produce SAF. Kids are then motivated to think about recycling and reuse.

Custom content for educators and parents

Since 2018, the Airbus Foundation Discovery Space programme is helping educators and parents to engage with their children and students on STEM topics.

For educators, the ""Future of the skies"" series can help give new impetus to their science classes dedicated to explaining SAF as an alternative to conventional fuels, especially in these times of energy crisis. Likewise, it can also contribute to their students' better understanding of STEM importance in daily life.

For parents, the series can provide an after-school educational activity or a fun family leisure time. It can also help foster family discussion about how science and technology can lead to rewarding and meaningful careers in the future, as children begin to think about how they can put their talents and imaginations to work in the service of protecting our planet.

All of the content included in the series is produced in four languages: English, French, German and Spanish. These animations will be progressively shared on the Airbus Foundation Discovery Space’s social media channels, from YouTube to Twitter, and on a web platform.

This new chapter highlights how advances in science can be explained with simple examples from everyday life.

DALLAS — Reports have surfaced about the possibility of the Ukrainian aircraft manufacturer, Antonov, working towards developing a second An-225.

An article from the German aerospace magazine Flug Revue states that the airframe is at the Antonov plant in Sviatoshyn, near Kyiv. The airframe is reported to be 60-70% complete, but at an undisclosed location, according to other reports.

In addition, in a recent CNN report, the Ukrainian state-owned company confirmed that it was working on the project to bring back the An-225. But can it do it alone?

“The process of rebuilding ‘Mriya’ is considered an international project,” with the participation of aviation enterprises from “different countries” around the world, the company said via email to CNN.

“The possibility of attracting funding from various sources is being considered, and proposals from many organizations that are ready to join the project are being reviewed.”

Possible Help From Airbus and Boeing?

As reported on mdr.de (Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk), Chief Pilot Dmytro Antonov explains, “We are still in contact with manufacturers such as Boeing, Airbus, and Embraer to ask them to help us rebuild Mriya. Also, we’re still examining the wreckage of the destroyed machine to see if we can reuse some of the components, but we won’t know how expensive it will be until after the war.”

“We have to talk to politicians and business people after the war. A project like this can only be implemented internationally. But even prominent aviation enthusiasts can support us, like Leonardo DiCaprio, Richard Branson, or even Elon Musk.”

With Hostomel Airport (GML) destroyed in February and Kyiv unstable, Antonov Airlines (ADB) has been operating its fleet of five AN-124s from Leipzig Halle (LEJ) to global destinations. As for maintenance, it runs its very own unit at LEJ.

With an ever-strong spirit, pride, and passion towards its glorious bird, back in February, Antonov posted on its Facebook page that “the dream will never die.”

Perhaps we’ll see another AN-225 in this lifetime.

Airbus advances design of Airspace Link smart platform - Runway Girl Network,"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvYWlyYnVzLWFpcnNwYWNlLWxpbmstZGlnaXRhbC1zbWFydC1wbGF0Zm9ybS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Anyone who has connected their oven to the Internet to cook this year’s Thanksgiving turkey to perfection or used a smart HVAC system to achieve an ideal thermal comfort level for their guests, understands how the Internet of Things (IoT) can make our lives easier on the ground. But according to Airbus, these consumer expectations are making their way to aircraft cabins. That’s why its teams are busy designing an ecosystem that will support a variety of IoT-enabled services in-flight.

At the heart of Airbus’ so-called Airspace Link ecosystem is the Intelligent Core Management Platform or iCMP, a fiber optics-based solution that will ultimately provide the infrastructure for a digital smart platform onboard. By pulling and aggregating relevant data from sensor-equipped cabin elements and combining those with different data sources such as crew resource management (CRM) or ground operations, the iCMP is expected to drive operational efficiencies and optimize ancillary revenues for airlines whilst improving the passenger experience (PaxEx) through personalization.

During this summer’s Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg and more recently at the APEX/IFSA Exhibition in Long Beach, California, Airbus executives demonstrated real-life applications of its Airspace Link IoT Services, including how smart galleys and smart trolleys monitor which meals and beverages have been purchased — and which have not — to ensure airlines can better provision for the next flight and facilitate a faster turnaround at the gate. This in turn cuts down on crew members’ manual processes and slashes the weight onboard, ergo creating a more sustainable flight that burns less fuel and reduces wastage.

At present, there is a lack of visibility into what is being stored and consumed, and who has ordered what. Airspace Link IoT Services can fix that problem, suggested management. The system can even offer data on a very granular level. Airbus vice president cabin marketing Ingo Wuggetzer described a scenario whereby a passenger chooses their meal from an airline menu a day or even five hours before the flight. Armed with this information, the caterer can obviously provision exactly what the passenger wants and in the desired sequence. Meanwhile, the smart trolley onboard recognizes what the passenger has consumed on their tray, and what has been left behind, further informing catering and logistics.

For years, Airbus has discussed how adding sensors to aircraft seats, lavatories, overhead bins, galleys and other aircraft interiors can create self-aware cabins. It has even tested some of these applications in-flight as part of its specially fitted A350 known as the Airspace Explorer Flight-Lab. But 2022 has been about putting the building blocks in place to make the dream a reality. The iCMP is now slated to debut on the A320 in 2026, becoming that ‘one flexible platform that connects everything onboard’.

In advance of its debut, Airbus is already adopting an open platform approach for nearer-term aircraft deliveries. Under the Airspace Link umbrella, the airframer and its airline customers as well as their development partners can create a wide variety of apps for this ecosystem. Given the clear benefits of connecting galleys and trolleys, it is perhaps unsurprising that the first application available from Airspace Link is a ‘Wireless IFE App’ — delivered to the airline by one of three software partners: Bluebox, Inflight Dublin and Display Interactive — which rides on Airbus’ own head-end server hardware (supplied by Kid-Systeme as part of an optional Open Software Platform known as Airbus OSP). The server is available for linefit and retrofit installations.

Not only does the Wireless IFE App deliver entertainment and other content to passengers’ own devices, it facilitates e-commerce onboard, including the ordering of food, beverages and other retail from the inflight menu.

Each software partner in the program — Bluebox, Inflight Dublin and Display Interactive — will offer a slightly differentiated offering, but “by and large, we’re pushing forward on things like expanding the retail capabilities”, Bluebox CEO Kevin Clark told Runway Girl Network in Long Beach.

Wetlease charter specialist Titan Airways has already taken delivery of its first Airbus A321LR with Airbus OSP and Bluebox software. But Jetstar is the first single-aisle airline customer, working with partner Bluebox. TUNISAIR, a customer of Inflight Dublin, is eyeing a soft launch of Airbus OSP, revealed Airbus. And a Condor A330 aircraft will soon debut with Airbus OSP.

“This is really where for us the platform principle started,” said Airbus upgrades marketing director Yannic Duifhuizen. By having one technology backbone really integrated seamlessly into the aircraft, “the airline operates the service provider that they choose” and can also swap their provider, he said.

“That is really our differentiator,” he continued. “Many other of the friends you see around us, you know they of course deliver the service with their embedded hardware. We are breaking that, the bundling aspect of it.” A retrofit option for non-Airbus fleets, called GeniusLINK, is also now on offer.

Live inflight connectivity also has a role to play in this digital smart platform, with Airbus announcing at the APEX/IFSA EXPO that it it is building out its Airspace Link HBCplus, supplier-furnished high bandwidth connectivity program to include satellite operator SES as a Ka-band managed service provider, in addition to Inmarsat with its Global Xpress service. In a similar vein to how Airbus OSP enables participating airlines to swap software partners without changing the linefit wireless IFE hardware onboard, HBCplus enables participating airlines to switch bandwidth suppliers without changing the linefit IFC hardware on their aircraft.

But while it makes sense to use IFC to support real-time credit card transactions and transmit other ops data in-flight, Airbus executives reiterated at EXPO that most of the IoT Services data gleaned from Airspace Link can be offloaded at the gate.

At the end of the day, said Wuggetzer, the broader Airspace Link program is about providing “flexibility and choice to our customers”. While Airbus is still building up this ecosystem, it is “ramping up partners in all fields” including for its IoT Services, App Store and inflight connectivity suppliers, he revealed.

Speaking at a briefing about the European manufacturer’s emissions-cutting plans on Wednesday, Guillaume Faury said he had concerns about the pace of investment in facilities to produce “green” hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Aviation is proving to be one of the hardest industries to decarbonise because battery technology is not yet advanced enough to power aeroplanes beyond relatively short journeys.

Green hydrogen, produced from water using zero-carbon electricity, offers one possible solution, while SAF, made with plant sources or using carbon from the air, can be used in existing gas turbine engines without adding to the total carbon in the atmosphere.

Airbus has said it aims to fly zero-emissions hydrogen aircraft in commercial service by 2035 but Faury said a lack of green production of the gas “could be a reason for delaying the launch of the programme”.

He said: “Availability or lack of availability of clean hydrogen at the right quantity in the right place at the right price in the second half of the decade is a big concern for me. The infrastructure for producing and distributing green hydrogen is still in the early stages of development. But the clock is ticking for it to be in place to fuel commercial aviation by the 2030s, and probably many other sectors much earlier.”

Several companies are trying to develop hydrogen technology. The British engineering company Rolls-Royce and the airline easyJet on Monday announced they had started the world’s first ground tests of an aircraft engine run on hydrogen combustion. Airbus is working with the US multinational GE and the French engine manufacturer Safran to mount a hydrogen combustion engine on an A380 superjumbo. Airbus’s biggest rival, Boeing, has made some tentative steps towards testing hydrogen technologies, although it is more focused on SAF.

Airbus on Wednesday said it was working on an aircraft engine powered by a hydrogen fuel cell, which produces electricity with water as the only emission, to start flight tests in about 2026. The propeller engine could potentially power a 100-passenger aircraft with a range of 1,000 nautical miles, the company said, although it would be unlikely to ever be used for long-haul flights because of the amount of hydrogen storage that would be required.

The manufacturer also said it would work with the French carmaker Renault on battery technology including solid-state batteries. These could store twice the energy in the same weight as the lithium ion batteries used in cars.

The industry’s preferred method for decarbonising long-haul flights is SAF. New Airbus planes are certified to fly using as much as 50% of SAF already but Faury said the company was not pushing to certify them for 100% SAF flights as quickly as possible because it did not foresee enough supply by 2030. Airbus announced it had signed a preliminary agreement with Neste, an oil refining company, to work together to advance SAF production.

“By 2030, SAF will need to be produced at many times the level of today,” Faury said. “Ambition is not yet matched by action. There needs to be more investment in new refineries and production facilities, and more ambitious mandates and objectives for sustainable aviation fuel.

“I believe it is difficult to overstate the scale of the energy challenge.”"
Azul Linhas Aéreas adds three additional A330neo to fleet - Airbus,"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0xMS1henVsLWxpbmhhcy1hZXJlYXMtYWRkcy10aHJlZS1hZGRpdGlvbmFsLWEzMzBuZW8tdG8tZmxlZXTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"São Paulo, 16 November 2022 – Azul has signed a firm order for three A330-900 which will allow it to further expand its international network and complement its existing A330 operations, bringing the airline’s total fleet of A330neo aircraft to eight.

“We are delighted to have secured three more next-gen Airbus widebody aircraft for the upcoming years. This reaffirms our position as the airline with the most modern fleet in the region, with 70 percent of our capacity coming from fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly aircraft,” said John Rodgerson, Chief Executive Officer of Azul.

“We applaud Azul’s decision that shows their forward looking strategy and proves the economics and performance of the A330neo are most compelling. The A330neo is the perfect tool to support Azul in expanding its fleet with the right-sized, modern widebody, leveraging the latest technology and efficiency and contributing to reducing CO2,” said Christian Scherer, Chief Commercial Officer and Head of Airbus International.

The A330neo is a member of Airbus’ leading Widebody Family that provides lower operating costs and reduced environmental footprint by combining enhanced technologies from the A350 with highly efficient Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines. Featured with the Airspace cabin, the A330neo offers an unmatched passenger experience and operational efficiency thanks to a redesigned welcome area, enhanced mood lighting, larger and modern overhead compartments and new window and lavatory designs.

Azul Linhas Aereas launched operations in 2008 and has since grown to service more than 150 destinations within Brazil, and flies non-stop to the United States, Europe and South America. Azul received the Americas’ first A330neo in 2019 and operates 12 A330 Family aircraft. In the coming weeks, Azul will start operating four A350-900 to further expand its route offering and benefit from the Airbus commonality concept.

In Latin America and the Caribbean, Airbus has sold over 1,150 aircraft and has a backlog of over 500, with more than 700 in operation throughout the region, representing almost 60 percent market share of the in-service fleet. Since 1994, Airbus has secured approximately 70 percent of net orders in the region.

Among the most notable are its development of a zero-emission hydrogen fuel cell engine, and a collaboration with fuel producer Neste aimed at speeding the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF.

The company revealed these and other plans during its annual Airbus Summit taking place today and tomorrow in Toulouse, France.

Airbus said it will begin ground and flight testing its fuel cell engine on the A380 demonstrator aircraft known as ZEROe “towards the middle of the decade.” The company said the aircraft is being modified so it can carry liquid hydrogen fuel tanks.

“Fuel cells are a potential solution to help us achieve our zero-emission ambition and we are focused on developing and testing this technology to understand if it is feasible and viable for a 2035 entry-into-service of a zero-emission aircraft,” said Glenn Llewellyn, vice president of zero-emission aircraft for Airbus.

Airbus said that with continued development, fuel cell engines could potentially power a 100-passenger aircraft with a range of 1,000 nm. Its current testing will offer options for the design of a future ZEROe aircraft, which Airbus said it plans to launch “in the 2027-2028 timeframe.”

Airbus also said it entered an agreement with Neste aimed at advancing the production and adoption of SAF across the aviation market. The companies said they “share a vision that SAF is a key solution to helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions of air travel. This collaboration aims to accelerate the aviation sector’s transition to SAF.”

Neste and Airbus said the new agreement will allow them to work together to more easily drive production and use of SAF while pursuing business opportunities and new fuel technology. Airbus and Neste said one of their main goals is “investigating how ‘100 percent SAF’ use can be enabled.”

Airbus said all of its aircraft are currently certified to fly with a blend of up to 50 percent SAF. It expects the partnership with Neste to be “instrumental to reaching certification for up to 100 percent SAF before the end of the decade.”

Other activities at the Summit included unveiling Airbus’ DisruptiveLab, a new airborne lab within a helicopter that tests technology for cutting the CO2 emissions of helicopters. The company said the lab will “evaluate a new aerodynamic architecture intended to reduce fuel consumption, as well as pursuing the implementation of hybridization with a fully parallel hybrid propulsion system that enables the battery to be recharged in-flight.”

Airbus said the helicopter demonstrator will begin flying by the end of this year."

DALLAS — The Airbus A220 aircraft has become a favorite in the 100-to-150-seat category for airlines and passengers alike. We’ll dive into the type’s momentum, starting off with its latest order.

Just last month, Air Canada (AC) bolstered its previous Airbus A220 order with an additional 15 aircraft that will swell the ranks of AC’s A220 to a total of 60 aircraft by the end of 2026.

The original order, placed in 2016 with the manufacturer, Bombardier, included 45 firm orders with the option for 30 more aircraft. As of November 2022, 31 aircraft currently operate in the AC fleet.

These new 15 aircraft will be assembled in Montreal, Quebec, making the aircraft truly Canadian.

This expanded order for the A220, built up the road from our Montreal headquarters, is an important development in the modernization of our fleet and a clear indication that we are emerging from the pandemic solidly positioned for the future… Michael Rousseau, President and CEO, Air Canada

What Makes Air Canada’s A220 Great?

At 137 seats, the A220 serves as a testament to the airline’s commitment to passenger comfort and experience. The type is split into two cabins. In the forward cabin, AC offers 12 North American business-class seats. These seats offer supreme comfort and prestige with a comfortable 37-inch pitch. The remaining 125 seats comprise the typical economy class in a 2×3 configuration.

A 19-inch seat width reinforces that the A220 was built with comfort in mind. All seats offer both USB-A and USB-C ports, enabling any passenger to charge their device regardless of what type of USB their charging cable has.

Canada as a country has always been concerned with its global environmental footprint. The A220 helps aid Canada’s and Airbus’s mission to be a “green” manufacturer by reducing fuel consumption as well as CO2 emissions.

Compared to its predecessors, the A220 presents a 25% reduction in CO2 emissions as well as fuel consumption per seat.

A different type of pollution that is not mentioned often enough, noise is also lowered by operating the A220. In airports with strict noise abatement policies or airports with standard noise emission reduction policies, the A220 may be able to benefit the public as well as the airline.

This alone helps towards making a sustainable, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective aviation industry for Canada.

A Checkered Past

With the success of AC’s A220, the aircraft did have defeats in the mid to late 2010s. In 2017, Airbus acquired a majority stake in the Bombardier C-Series project in a landmark deal between Airbus, Bombardier, and the Government of Quebec.

The acquisition helped tremendously in making Airbus a global leader in medium-sized aircraft. The almost untapped demand for a 100-150-seat single-aisle aircraft would skyrocket for the foreseeable future.

Keep in mind, this is in a pre-COVID aviation industry where air travel was on a steady rise. The partnership would quash any financial woes plaguing the C-Series project, as well as scale up the aircraft’s production.

Canada as a whole would also benefit from this newly formed partnership by keeping production Canadian. Airbus currently employs over 4000 Canadians and creates 23000 indirect jobs in the Canadian aerospace sector.

The A220 Around the World

Not only has the A220 seen success in Canada, but also worldwide. As of September 2022, there were 227 A220 family aircraft in commercial service around the globe. The A220 aircraft has seen particular popularity in Europe and North America, where over 90% currently operate.

The five largest A220 operators are Delta Air Lines (DL) with 57, airBaltic (BT) with 36, AC with 31, SWISS (LX) with 30, and JetBlue (B6) with 12.

Outside of North America and Europe, airlines such as Air Tanzania (TC), Air Senegal (HC), and Air Manas (ZM) operate the A220 in their respective regions. EgyptAir (MS) of Cairo also operates 12 A220-300 aircraft.

The Airbus A220 remains in very high demand, with just over 120 orders in 2022 alone. As of November 2022, over 780 total A220 orders have been placed from airlines around the world.

Until the foreseeable future, AC remains the only Canadian operator of the A220.

DALLAS – Airbus and Air Canada have announced that they will invest in Canadian climate solutions company Carbon Engineering (CE) based in Squamish, British Columbia.

As part of its commitment to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, Air Canada (AC) will invest C$6.75 million (US$5.07 million). Airbus has yet to disclose the exact amount of its investment.

Carbon Capture Technology

The deal will support the company’s Direct Air Capture and Storage technology (DACCS). This uses large fans to pull in air from which carbon dioxide (CO2) is extracted using a series of chemicals. The remaining air is then released into the atmosphere while the CO2 is stored or used to create sustainable aviation fuels. CE is now developing facilities to capture 1 million tonnes of carbon annually.

Speaking of the investment, AC CEO Michael Rousseau said, “We remain focused on seeking innovative, long-term, sustainable [greenhouse gas] emissions reduction solutions for aviation, and carbon capture is one we have outlined in our strategy to achieving net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.”

“Last year, we became the first Canadian airline to sign [a memorandum of understanding] with CE to explore carbon capture scalability and other initiatives for our industry.”

Multi-million Dollar Investment

The investment forms part of AC’s C$50 million (US$37.2 million) to support new technology to reduce carbon emissions.

In September, AC announced that it had signed a purchase agreement for 30 ES-30 electric-hybrid regional aircraft from Heart Aerospace of Sweden. The deal would also see the carrier acquire a US$5 million equity stake in the manufacturer.

Airbus, meanwhile, has been studying DACCS technology for some time. In March, it agreed on a deal with US firm 1PointFive to purchase 400,000 tons of carbon removal credits using CE’s facilities. 1PointFive said it expects to open its first facility in Texas in 2024, with up to 70 Direct Air Capture plants opening worldwide by 2035.

The breakthrough expands and deepens the collaboration with China’s aviation industry, and demonstrates Airbus’ commitment to enhance its long-term strategic partnership with China.

The FAL in Tianjin officially started the adaptation work to become A321 capable in August 2022. It is the first major upgrade of the assembly line since operations commenced in 2008. FAL Tianjin’s first A321 aircraft is scheduled for delivery in early 2023.

“Since we announced our plans to expand the capability of FAL Tianjin to A321 production last November, I am proud that the Airbus Tianjin team has successfully completed the relevant adaptation work on schedule by working closely with European experts and our suppliers to overcome the impact of COVID-19” said George Xu, Airbus Executive Vice President and Airbus China CEO. “The commissioning of the first A321 aircraft underlines Airbus' commitment to China, marking a new milestone in the industrial cooperation with our Chinese partners.”

Airbus has four A320 Family assembly facilities around the world: Toulouse, France; Hamburg, Germany; Tianjin, China; and Mobile, United States. By the end of 2022, all commercial aircraft assembly sites will be A321-capable, as part of the industrial strategy to de-risk the ramp up and to meet the rising share of A321 production.

Inaugurated in 2008, FAL Tianjin was the first Airbus commercial aircraft assembly line outside Europe. In the same year, the first aircraft sections arrived on site. Since its first A320 delivery in 2009, FAL Tianjin has delivered more than 600 aircraft over its 14 years in operation. It has become a role model of successful Sino-European cooperation.

The A321neo is the longest-fuselage member of Airbus’ best-selling, single-aisle A320 Family, comfortably seating as many as 244 passengers in a higher-density arrangement, with a longest range reaching 4,700nm/8,700km. Featuring the widest single-aisle cabin in the sky, the A320neo Family offers a 20 % reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 as well as a 50% noise reduction compared to previous generation aircraft, thanks to incorporating the very latest technologies including new generation engines and Sharklets. By the end of September 2022, the A320neo Family has received over 8,500 firm orders from more than 130 customers worldwide.

Release Date November 3, 2022 Boeing officially passes the long-haul narrowbody torch to Airbus Purchase a PDF of this analysis

Boeing’s decision to push a clean sheet airplane to 2035 has a profound implication for one airplane in particular. Now alone in the market for at least the next decade, the A321neo is changing the business of long-haul narrowbody travel. However, with 862 aircraft in service as of November 3, 2022, according to ch-aviation, the A321neo family has yet to find its ultimate in range from the upcoming XLR.

Yet, the business of flying narrowbodies long distances is not new, forged by Boeing’s 757, which re-established the precedent for the single-aisle fleet that new-generation aircraft with ranges between 2,500 to 3,500 nautical miles have yet to surpass. Indeed, even the uniquely positioned north Atlantic corridor, analysis shows the recent renaissance of long-haul single-aisle flying has not yet reached 757-led historic highs.

Related: Boeing puts a quarter century between its all-new airplanes

As endurance continues to expand with the latest generation of narrowbodies, this TAC Analysis looks at the trend of flying the narrow farther. While the A321LR and the addition of its belly-consuming auxiliary fuel tanks works to dominate the long-haul narrowbody, we consider the context of the trails blazed before it.

The narrowbody has yet to achieve its historical potential for longer distances and the trend has been reignited. With the A321XLR and its redesigned fuel system waiting in the wings for its up to 4,700 nautical mile debut in the second quarter of 2024, the industry looks toward a regrowth of the long-haul narrowbody, destined to eclipse the heights of 2012 and the 757 which will remain unreplaced by Boeing."

Airbus' Target Systems & Services has now produced its 2,000th drone in Friedrichshafen.

The unmanned aerial system with the serial number 2,000, a Do-DT45, will be used in a military exercise at the training ground of Airbus partner Andøya Space Defence in Norway. There, it will be launched by an Airbus team via ramp, accelerate to up to 440 knots (814 km/h) and climb to 25,000 feet (7,620 metres) depending on the requirements.

In the air, the Do-DT45 can then simulate a range of threats such as: fighter jets, drones or cruise missiles, which customers can engage in with live fire. The operation does not pose any risk: Andøya Space Defence's training site is a restricted area; the remains of the target drone are disposed of properly.

""The current volatile world situation shows that a functioning air defence is more important than ever,"" said Frank Härtel, Head of Target Systems & Services at Airbus Defence and Space in Friedrichshafen. ""In this respect, we make our contribution to a safer world out of deepest conviction: With our aerial target drones and services, Air Defenders can prepare themselves in case of threats and save lives.""

Airbus Defence and Space Target Systems & Services - The Portfolio

In addition to the Do-DT45, the Target Systems & Services solution portfolio also includes the Do-DT55 (simulates anti-radar missiles), HT05 (simulates combat helicopters) and Do-DT25 (simulates fighter jets, drones and cruise missiles). Customers are armed forces from all over the world who use the flight target display as a full service. The Target Systems & Services team brings material and personnel to the site, sets up launchers and ground control stations and gets the drones ready for take-off. The flights are planned and carried out according to the customer's requests.

Do-DT drones are not only used as target drones. Equipped with sensors and data links, they can also be used to test the interaction of unmanned and manned aircraft for the Future Combat Air System (FCAS)or technologies for autonomous air-to-air refuelling.

Airbus Hydrogen-powered Zero-emissions Engine – Airways - Airways Magazine,"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLXplcm8tZS1lbmdpbmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Hydrogen-powered Zero-emissions Engine

DALLAS — Airbus has disclosed that it is working on a fuel cell engine that runs on hydrogen. The propulsion system would outfit Airbus’ ZEROe planes, which are slated to go into service in 2035.

Airbus is in the process of installing liquid hydrogen tanks and distribution systems on its A380 MSN1 flight test aircraft. The manufacturer hopes to begin ground and flight testing of the fuel cell engine architecture on its ZEROe demonstrator by the middle of the decade.

Instead of using combustion to produce electricity, fuel cells—first developed by Sir William Grove in 1838—generate electricity using an electrochemical reaction.

Fuel cells differ from batteries in that they need an ongoing supply of fuel and oxygen whereas batteries get their chemical energy from materials that are already within the battery. Therefore, fuel cells can continuously generate electricity for as long as fuel and oxygen are available.

The only by-products from fuel cells that use hydrogen to directly generate electricity are heat and water.

The Power of Hydrogen

Because hydrogen can be produced from renewable energy sources without emitting any carbon dioxide, and because water is one of its main byproducts, it has been identified by Airbus as one of the most promising alternatives for powering a zero-emission aircraft.

Hydrogen can be used as an aircraft propulsion fuel in two different ways. First via hydrogen combustion in a gas turbine, and second, by using fuel cells to convert hydrogen into electricity in order to power a propeller engine. A hydrogen gas turbine can also be coupled with fuel cells instead of batteries in a hybrid-electric architecture.

Airbus also says that hydrogen fuel cells increase their power output when stacked together, allowing for scalability. In addition, an engine powered by hydrogen fuel cells produces zero NOx emissions or contrails thereby offering additional decarbonization benefits.

Airbus has been researching the potential of fuel cell propulsion systems in the aviation industry for some time. As a joint venture with ElringKlinger, a company with more than 20 years of experience as a supplier of fuel cell systems and components, Airbus established Aerostack in October 2020.

In December 2020, Airbus unveiled its pod concept, which featured six detachable fuel cell propeller propulsion systems.

Comments from Airbus

“Fuel cells are a potential solution to help us achieve our zero-emission ambition and we are focused on developing and testing this technology to understand if it is feasible and viable for a 2035 entry-into-service of a zero-emission aircraft,” said Glenn Llewellyn, VP Zero-Emission Aircraft, Airbus.

The holy grail of aircraft propulsion is to provide power without any emissions. One of the most promising candidates is the hydrogen fuel cell. Airbus

Mr. Llewellyn added, “At scale, and if the technology targets were achieved, fuel cell engines may be able to power a one-hundred-passenger aircraft with a range of approximately 1,000 nautical miles.”

“By continuing to invest in this technology we are giving ourselves additional options that will inform our decisions on the architecture of our future ZEROe aircraft, the development of which we intend to launch in the 2027-2028 timeframe,” said the Airbus VP.

Inmarsat well positioned as airlines show interest in Airbus HBCplus - Runway Girl Network,"Mon, 07 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvaW5tYXJzYXQtaW50ZXJlc3QtaW4tYWlyYnVzLWhiY3BsdXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With airlines already expressing interest in Airbus’ new HBCplus supplier-furnished inflight connectivity program, Inmarsat is confident that its Global Xpress network — which will be augmented with two payloads in Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) for Arctic coverage in 2023 — and its GX-powered IFC service will prove to be a highly compelling option for those carriers that opt to tick the box for HBCplus when buying new A320, A330 and A350 twinjets.

As part of the linefit HBCplus program, Airbus thus far is offering a choice of two managed service providers (MSPs) in the Ka-band frequency: Inmarsat with GX, and SES with its forthcoming hybrid network including O3b mPOWER MEO satellites. But Inmarsat, a longtime partner to the European airframer for both cockpit/safety and cabin connectivity, reckons it has a meaningful head start and leg up.

Noting that Inmarsat was the first MSP to be selected for the HBCplus program, Inmarsat Aviation president Niels Steenstrup told RGN at the APEX/IFSA Exhibition in Long Beach that: “At Inmarsat, we will tend to run towards things instead of away from them, which is [why it] made sense to collaborate with Airbus to help Airbus, Safran and so on to provide this solution to the market and make it that easy for airlines to make this selection.

“So, we knew that there was going to be others that they would partner with over time to help give airlines choice. That’s fine, but we were there first and there’s a reason we were there first because we have our global network and so on. We do feel confident because we’re the only ones with a global, uniform network [broadband].”

Additionally, Inmarsat is already quite familiar with Airbus’ chosen terminal for the HBCplus program, i.e., Safran Passenger Innovations’ terminal with ThinKom Solutions’ VICTS antenna as core, and indeed more specifically with VICTS. That’s because SPI’s terminal was recently installed on a cluster of Qatar Airways Boeing 787s, as part of the carrier’s decision to bring Inmarsat GX to 80 more aircraft in its fleet and Qatar’s selection of the SPI terminal, which is going through the offerability process at Boeing. And, separately, Inmarsat last year positioned Stellar Blu’s (formerly GDC Technics’) new IFC terminal with ThinKom VICTS as its nextgen global solution for GX transmissions in aviation. SAUDIA will use the Stellar Blu terminal to offer GX IFC to passengers on 35 Airbus narrowbody deliveries, starting in early 2023.

“[I]n terms of a reliable antenna that is in the market now and available, the ThinKom-based terminals that really combine the mechanical and the phased array [are] really a very, very strong reliable solution,” said Steenstrup.

Does Inmarsat expect that LEO satellites will need to be part of its IFC service overtime? “Yes,” said Steenstrup, “that’s why we have Orchestra” – the multi-orbit network, announced last year, that will bring together Inmarsat’s existing near global GEO satellites with terrestrial 4G/5G and what is envisaged as being a small constellation of LEO satellites.

At the same time, Inmarsat does not feel immediately threatened by the march of the LEOs and MEOs gaining some traction in aero. The combination of capabilities provided by Orchestra “will be stronger than something that is just GEO or just LEO,” he said.

To that end, the London-headquartered firm last year activated an initial LEO payload to conduct some testing. “We’re doing some work in some of the other business units in Inmarsat, with mesh networks and maritime and so on at this time,” said Steenstrup. “And so, Orchestra is an evolving solution where we start combining the different parts of the networks.”

It’s about providing the right capacity where you need it, when you need it. So, the terrestrial solution is not going to work when the plane gets off out of the airport, right? But it can be great at the airport. A LEO solution could be good in some places, but it’s not going to work in highly congested areas, a place with lots of planes. GEO, especially with our new GX 7, 8 and 9 satellites coming onboard; we can do dynamic beamforming, put capacity where we need it. So, you know, Orchestra will be combining the various technologies to give us — even more so than we have today — the capacity where we need it, when we need it.

As reported, Airbus told RGN at the APEX/IFSA EXPO that traditional aero ISPs will exist between the airline that chooses HBCplus and their chosen MSP, if the airline desires that sort of arrangement. “So that’s really between the airline and the MSP to define together,” said Airbus upgrades marketing director Yannic Duifhuizen.

He revealed that Airbus is fielding interest in HBCplus from airlines all over the world, including with low-cost carriers which “are now exploring and really are knocking on our door whereas, maybe some years ago, that wouldn’t have been happening as much as it does now.”

But will LCCs use a classic aero ISP in the middle or simply go completely direct? That remains to be seen, but Inmarsat stands ready with its OneFi solution — a new connected platform for airlines that brings multiple inflight services together within a single portal interface.

Outside of HBCplus, Inmarsat has already secured two airline customers for OneFi — SAUDIA, as announced when Inmarsat revealed that the carrier will launch the new Stellar Blu terminal for GX, and another as-yet-undisclosed operator. Inmarsat is also now offering new bundles for OneFi. Airlines can select the core OneFi Connect module, which offers airline-branded connectivity and ISP functionality, plus any of six additional bundles, covering customer feedback; loyalty; wireless entertainment; media including moving maps and PDF magazines; advertising, and buy-on-board shopping.

In short, with OneFi, Inmarsat can offer the type of value-add that traditional aero ISPs often perform.

“It just makes it very easy for an airline to again take that [OneFi] platform to use in the way they want to and only take the bundles they need,” explained Steenstrup.

Croatia Airlines plans to lease an additional nine A220s, taking its total commitment for the type to 15.

The A220s will replace previous generation aircraft in the company's fleet, reducing operating costs as well as improving environmental efficiency and competitiveness while offering passengers unrivaled comfort throughout its fleet.

“Today’s signing of a contract for the purchase of state-of-the-art Airbus aircraft is a very special moment for all of us at Croatia Airlines. It marks the beginning of a new period of aviation, a new period in the life of Croatia Airlines, a new period for our passengers, and a new period for Croatia’s tourism and economy as a whole,” said Jasmin Bajić, CEO and President of the Management Board of Croatia Airlines.

“We are thrilled to add Croatia Airlines as a new A220 customer. The A220 is ideally suited to Croatia's aviation needs, providing operational flexibility and efficiency allowing its airline to pursue its ambition for both regional and international connectivity without compromising on any aspect, be it passenger comfort or trip and seat cost economics,” said Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer and Head of International.

The A220 is a clean sheet design and the only aircraft purpose-built for the 100 to 150-seat market segment bringing together state-of-the-art aerodynamics, advanced materials and Pratt & Whitney’s latest generation GTF™ engines. The A220 delivers a 50% reduced noise footprint, up to 25% lower fuel burn per seat and CO 2 emissions - compared to previous generation aircraft, as well as around 50% lower NOx emissions than industry standards.

Airbus and Croatia Airlines have had a long-standing partnership starting 25 years ago, when the airline first became an Airbus operator. Today, the Croatian carrier operates an Airbus fleet of seven single-aisle aircraft from the A320 Family (five A319s and two A320s).

With currently more than 230 A220s delivered to 16 airlines operating on four continents, the A220 is the optimal aircraft for regional as well as long-distance routes and will enable Croatia Airlines to further contribute to the development of tourism in the region, while providing flexibility to right-size their operations.

To date, more than 70 million passengers have enjoyed the A220. The fleet is currently flying on over 800 routes and 325 destinations worldwide. As of the end of October 2022, around 30 customers have ordered 780+ A220 aircraft - confirming its breakthrough on the small single-aisle market."

Prosecutors said Wednesday’s decision focuses on bribery in relation with the sale of commercial aircraft, helicopters and satellites to Libya and Kazakhstan, mostly between 2006 and 2011. It follows the same formula used during the first investigation that led to the 2020 deal, they added.

At the time, French prosecutors had said the agreement was unprecedented because of its scale and the fact that it had been arranged with three countries.

Airbus said in a statement that the new agreement covers “past matters relating to the use of intermediaries in sales campaigns prior to 2012.”

The company has taken “significant steps since 2016 to reform itself by implementing a benchmark compliance system underpinned by an unwavering commitment to integrity and continuous improvement,” it said.

The 2020 agreement was reached after federal prosecutors in the U.S. alleged that Airbus ran a years-long corruption campaign across the world, using bribes and falsely reporting information for more than five years to gain valuable licenses to export U.S. military technology.

British and French authorities were investigating allegations of fraud and bribery related to Airbus’ use of outside consultants to sell planes. U.S. authorities were also investigating Airbus’ compliance with American arms trafficking regulations."

The Executive A319 ACJ can fly billionaires and their teams (19 guests in all) in the lap of luxury.

Though admittedly splendid, Emirates A380 and Boeing 777 aircraft aren’t functional for those who prefer to – or have to – fly private.

Adnan Kazim, Emirates’ divisional senior vice-president for planning, aeropolitical and industry affairs, commented, “We have seen an increasing demand in the private travel segment, especially in the Middle East and Europe as well as in markets such as India, Russia and China, we are looking to tap into this niche market with the high quality of service and attention to detail.”

The private jet has the range to fly within eight hours’ distance of any airport and can reach all continents, with one stop to the Americas.

Let’s explore what marvels the Emirates Executive jet contains …

Plush private suites

Emirates Executive A319’s suites provide just the right amount of breathing room and privacy.

The interior of the Emirates Executive A319 aircraft can be completely customised to suit your travel requirements. The on-board suites impress first with scale (the private suites are more extensive than those in Emirates Premium First Class cabins) and then with privacy.

The Emirates Executive A319 provides a comfortable in-flight experience, to say the least.

The doors slide shut to enclose passengers in a cosy cocoon, including flatbed seats, a visitor’s chair and ambient lighting.

Passengers won’t be bored on board the Emirates Executive A319 with the available in-flight entertainment.

Entertainment and respite are taken care of thanks to a well-stocked minibar and a personal 32-inch screen for in-flight entertainment. Passengers can look forward to personal service and relaxing on a large bed of feather pillows.

A rejuvenating on-board spa shower

Treat yourself to a luxurious shower with Sodashi spa products aboard the Emirates Executive A319.

Travelling via the Emirates Executive A319 also involves mid-flight rejuvenation in the luxurious spa shower and separate powder room. Make the most of your leisurely time 12,000 metres in the air by unwinding in a spa decked out in classic walnut and marble. Allow your fast-paced life to slow down as you indulge in a range of Sodashi products. Then dry off using the finest linens.

Dining amid the stars

Master chefs prepare light snacks, a gourmet buffet, afternoon tea and cocktails aboard the Emirates Executive A319.

In a similar vein as Kylie Jenner’s US$73 million Kylie Air , Emirates master chefs offer a delicious in-flight dining experience with sumptuous meals, light snacks, a gourmet buffet when travelling with a large party, afternoon tea with hors d’oeuvres, and the most tantalising cocktails and canapés.

Emirates Executive A319’s lounge area is huge enough to transform into a private restaurant.

Much like the living area in a five-star hotel suite, a dedicated lounge is where conversations, discussions or meals take place at your discretion. The expansive space can be occupied as a private restaurant, board room, or hang-out space where you can unwind with friends.

Uninterrupted business

Conduct your business as usual aboard the Emirates Executive A319.

If you’re flying for business, not pleasure, the Emirates Airbus A319 ACJ has got you covered too, allowing you to conduct business globally with convenience, luxury and top-notch service.

To conduct business en route, a conference table can be arranged with the latest technology at your disposal. That way, you can have your team on board and conduct business as usual – albeit 12,000 metres in the sky. Or you can jet with your team to evening cocktails in Europe after taking breakfast in Dubai. As you do.

The Emirates Executive A319 provides connectivity throughout the entire flight with high-speed internet.

If the lounge area isn’t enough space for you to entertain guests, the private office doubles up as a lounge as well, where you can socialise over drinks and canapés. And when it comes to overnight business trips, 15 guests can sleep in suites while five more can snooze on converted beds in the lounge.

Passengers also benefit from high-speed internet and mobile phone connectivity throughout the flight, of course.

While the pricing for the Emirates Executive Jet differs on many factors such as the route, number of passengers and so forth, you can expect to shell out around US$15,000 to US$20,000 per hour.

Airbus and Boeing drive IFC interoperability via Seamless Air Alliance - Runway Girl Network,"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvYWlyYnVzLWJvZWluZy1zZWFtbGVzcy1haXItYWxsaWFuY2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Co-chairing the Seamless Air Alliance’s inflight connectivity interoperability working group, Airbus and new member Boeing are “both driving to the same goal” of making linefit IFC components more standard and interchangeable to ensure that airlines have the flexibility to swap or upgrade service if they see fit, member executives told Runway Girl Network at the APEX/IFSA Exhibition in Long Beach.

“[T]he interoperability group, now driven by Airbus and Boeing, gives gravity to the situation so to speak. Now, it’s not us pushing the idea of interoperability like we were four years ago. Now it’s Airbus and Boeing working together. I mean, when they were presenting yesterday, you could hear a pin drop. That’s how much focus and attention they got from a standing room only group of our members wanting to know what’s next in the program and participating,” Seamless CEO Jack Mandala told RGN in reference to the alliance’s meeting in Long Beach.

Mandala added that the interoperability group is “one of our biggest working groups right now as far as participation”. The scope of this work item includes inflight connectivity, Aircraft Interface Device (AID) capability, and operational/administrative data including Electronic Flight Bag, aircraft health monitoring and more.

But on the cabin connectivity front, specifically, the interoperability working group’s efforts just happen to sync nicely with the direction that Airbus is already headed with its supplier-furnished HBCplus program. Airlines that tick the box for HBCplus when buying Airbus commercial aircraft will be able to change their managed service provider (MSP) whilst leaving the lion’s share of IFC hardware in place.

I’m certainly not alone in seeing the correlation between Seamless’ work and the HBCplus announcements from Seamless founding member Airbus. Satcom guru Peter Lemme, who is known in industry for his Arinc 791/792 standards work for broadband antenna radome install packages, and now serves as Seamless Air Alliance chief consultant, noted on Twitter that the alliance is:

developing guidance for breaking apart backhaul as a functional component, with means to reuse the antenna and easily change the modem. Also, how to change MSP easily. [Seamless] architecture promotes functional interchangeability of both backhaul and also portal.

Specific to the alliance’s work, Arnaud Mestrallet, who serves as end-to-end connectivity architect for Airbus’ commercial platforms, said Boeing shares the same objective as Airbus – that is “to make the life of our airlines easier at the moment of the first installation of their inflight connectivity system, but also to upgrade it. So that’s why we are looking for more interoperability in order to make the bricks interchangeable between them and not for the airline to be trapped with a system getting old. So, they have the possibility to upgrade it and to give the best performance of connectivity to their passenger.”

Bryan Wiltse, who handles cabin systems and feature strategy at Boeing, said in a published statement about the interoperability working group: “The program covers requirements for physical architecture and logical interfaces and ultimately delivers a more flexible system to the airline.”

(On an aside, as part of HBCplus, Airbus has adopted “one antenna to rule them all”, at least in the Ka-band frequency, i.e., the Safran Passenger Innovations terminal with ThinKom VICTS as core. But whilst Boeing hasn’t publicly announced the same SFE approach (yet?), SPI’s terminal is also going through the offerability process at Boeing, and both Airbus and Boeing customers are able to select this product today for future aircraft. A cluster of Qatar Airways Boeing 787s have already been fitted with the kit.)

Meanwhile, the interoperability working group is taking a longer-term view of making electronically steerable antenna (ESA) components interchangeable, with Mestrallet describing it as a ten-year project “in order for the system to be clearly completely agnostic of any constellation and of any system supplier”.

Seamless also reports that all its member airlines — numbering roughly a dozen operators — are now using its new Seamless Release 4 (SR4) toolkit, which features an IFC “design feature checklist”, in their requests for proposals (RFPs). A video highlighting Alaska Airlines’ use of the toolkit was on display at the alliance’s APEX/IFSA EXPO stand.

“So, you know all of the airlines that are part of us are using it in their RFPs and it’s an easy way for a smaller airline that doesn’t have a big staff to put together an RFP and get competitive bids back and have an apples-to-apples comparison, with common definitions and so it’s being used,” said Mandala. Even service providers that aren’t part of Seamless “have purchased the toolkit in order to be able to respond to these new RFPs that are coming out with the airlines”, he noted.

A critique that Seamless received is that its toolkit is too big, he said. “It’s 550-some odd measures you know, and it’s a little deeper than some of the airlines want to go. So, they came back and said ‘we need to put together a Seamless certification program that puts together sort of a core group of measures, a smaller group of measures, maybe 50 or 100 that we ask service providers to agree to provide to us so that we can hold them accountable and get a deeper dive into the data behind what’s impacting their systems.’ So that should be your Seamless-Certified programs, right.”

To advance its work in IFC performance measurement, a new research laboratory has been set up. Developed in conjunction with Seamless members GlobalReach Technology, Riverbed Technology, and Thales Group, the lab will be available to all alliance members who wish to measure service quality. It will also be used to develop and validate a hardened set of satisfaction indexes which Seamless said is “paramount to predicting IFC service quality”.

Seamless is not the only entity addressing this need. NetForecast, which measures Wi-Fi experience, is currently being trialed by several airlines. It wraps both quality of experience (QoE) and quality of service (QoS) measurements into a single score.

Effectively, Seamless and indeed NetForecast are helping airlines ensure that their service providers meet their SLAs.

“But the good news is the service providers are participating in the process and they’ve agreed to share that data, you know, anonymously, but so that we get the right scale and we understand which are the most important, and we agree on the common way of doing it,” said Mandala of aero ISPs’ participation in the Seamless lab tests.

Will Viasat join the Seamless Air Alliance?

“There’s no movement right now. We’re constantly talking to them. I do believe they’ll join. Maybe even soon,” said Mandala. “We are talking. I think it’s just a matter of time.”

For its part, Viasat vice president commercial mobility Don Buchman told RGN in answer to the question: “We’ll see … We’re not alliance allergic. We belong to the Wireless Broadband Alliance, the Streaming Video [Technology] Alliance.”

He said Viasat “haven’t seen the angle yet” but thinks “seamless connectivity is good. Wireless Broadband Alliance does that, terrestrially. So Hot Spot 2.O and all the things being launched with them. They’re basically bringing together all of those.”

Have you heard about versatility ? - Airbus,"Thu, 03 Nov 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTExLWhhdmUteW91LWhlYXJkLWFib3V0LXZlcnNhdGlsaXR50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Did you know that the Airbus widebody family is the only aircraft family which can fly efficiently on any sector, from short-haul to ultra-long-haul routes, while fulfilling various missions including military operations, cargo activities, and commercial flights for passengers? And all this is possible simply because of versatility. Let’s talk about it.

What versatility means.



In aviation, versatility usually refers to the aircraft capacity to meet different utilisations. And it starts at the very beginning of the design phase when the choices in terms of definition allow space for future developments.

Airbus started widebody versatility in the 1990s. By developing an aircraft platform for many different operational needs and flying distances, Airbus progressively extended the widebody operating capacity and its wide range of use to meet customers’ needs for network flexibility as well as seating and cargo capacity. “The definition of a platform is a long-term process, with the objective of building a family of aircraft with development potential for a lifecycle period of around 50 years,” say Vincent Lebas and Karine Lavergne, Airbus widebody aircraft design architects. “The challenge for Airbus teams is then to anticipate the future of the aircraft at an early stage of its conception. This is where versatility gets into action.”

To turn the idea into reality, the widebody family has been continuously improved along the years with incremental developments from simple weight variants to freighter, neo or Ultra Long Range variants. As a result, the aircraft family today serves many distances and many operations that vary from passenger, freight and VIP flights to military transport and aerial refueling. The widebody family now comprises two A330neo (A330-800 - A330-900), three A350 (A350-900 - A350-1000 and the new freighter A350F), the corporate jets ACJ330neo and ACJ350, the Multi Role Tanker Transport variant A330 MRTT alongside the A330 passenger-to-freighter (P2F) and the BelugaXL.

A key consideration for operators



For an airline, versatility is a key part of the aircraft’s value. This includes its capacity to be deployed on short, medium and long-haul routes and to allow various seating configurations. And unsurprisingly, this is the strength of the widebody family. But how does that work exactly ?

Versatility on routes and in the cabin



To be able to fly on long-haul and domestic routes, widebody aircraft need to be adapted accordingly. “For long-haul needs, we increase the take-off weight and engine thrust, while for short-haul routes, we reduce the weight and engine thrust. This is an interesting option for operators who have seasonal variations because there are no physical modifications to be made to the aircraft,” explains Vincent Lebas. “For example the A330neo can be optimised on the take-off weight according to the distance operated. It is capable of a take-off weight ranging from 200 up to 251 tons, by updating the aircraft's operational documentation such as the limitations chapter in the flight operations manual. We can also adapt for example the tyre pressure, thus offering the operator a product capable of flying many distances.”

Similarly, the A350-900 is certified for a take-off weight ranging from 210 up to 283 tons, enabling the aircraft to operate from domestic routes to ultra-long-range routes, a preferred choice for airlines who select the A350-900 Ultra Long Range. Compared to the standard aircraft, the Ultra Long Range version includes a modified fuel system, increasing the fuel carrying capacity from 24,000 litres to 165,000 litres. “This extends the range of the aircraft without the need for additional fuel tanks. This performance is possible thanks to the technical and intrinsic qualities of the A350 and the engineering capabilities of Airbus,” explains Karine Lavergne.

In addition to versatility on routes, operators also consider cabin versatility as an important factor. And here as well, both the A330neo and A350 offer several configurations for all business models, from a high density one-class configuration - usually preferred by low cost airlines on domestic routes - to a four-class configuration (First, Business, Premium Economy, Economy). These different configurations share a common point: they offer a high level of flexibility to operators without compromising passenger comfort.

The future of air travel will be versatile



One lesson learnt from the Covid-19 pandemic - when the number of flights dropped significantly - is that versatile aircraft are instrumental in airlines’ strategy to navigate crises, limit financial loss and continue to operate their fleet during uncertain times. To answer airlines’ needs for business continuity during the crisis and increase air cargo capacity, Airbus developed in a very short time a modification for A330 and A350 Family aircraft which enable airlines to install freight pallets directly onto the cabin floor seat tracks, after removal of the economy-class seats.“We have seen many operators flying both A330s and A350s in full cargo configuration, thanks to the high-cargo capacity of these aircraft”. Since the Covid-19 stimulated the freighter market, there has been a continuing demand for widebody reconfigurations into freighters and this trend is here to stay in a post-crisis world. Airlines want to operate more flexible aircraft, at lower operational cost, and the widebody family perfectly fits these needs.

“Beyond the crisis, experience over the years has taught us that the more an aircraft can be adapted in the long term, the more potential it has to meet market needs,” say Airbus specialists. Versatility has therefore become a key consideration for Airbus, and listening to customers a major lever for its implementation. ""Taking versatility into account was a turning point in Airbus’ history, and it changed our culture. When designing an aircraft, we have to keep in mind that the aircraft will live a long time and anticipate tomorrow's uses. So we have to maintain a continuous dialogue with operators to better understand their needs and meet their requirements, based on the adaptation of our product.”



Airbus’ latest edition of its Global Market Forecast highlights a future traffic growth of 3.6% over the next 20 years and an aircraft demand for 39,490 new passenger and freighter aircraft. This includes a demand for 7,870 widebodies while the demand for freighters is expected to reach 2,440 aircraft."
"Space-based solar power could really work, experiment shows - Space.com","Thu, 17 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS9haXJidXMtc3BhY2Utc29sYXItcG93ZXItdGVzdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus thinks it could have first space-based solar power demonstrators ready in the 2030s.

European aerospace giant Airbus demonstrated how solar power could be beamed from space in a new experiment.

So far, the wireless transmission system has only bridged the distance of a little over 100 feet (30 meters), but engineers are confident they can increase its range to reach all the way to space within the next decade.

The demonstration, which took place at Airbus' X-Works Innovation Factory in Germany in September, saw electrical power transmitted from a photovoltaic panel in the form of microwaves to a receiver some 118 feet (36 m) away. The beamed energy lit up a model city and powered a hydrogen generator and a fridge containing alcohol-free beer that the audience later enjoyed.

Even though it might seem as a long way to go from 118 feet to Earth 's orbit, Airbus engineers believe that ""the first operating Power Beaming prototypes could be in use"" by the early 2030s.

""Now that we have successfully tested the key bricks of a future space-based solar power system on a small scale for the first time, we are now ready to take power beaming to the next level,"" Yoann Thueux, the Airbus research project leader, said in a statement .

Airbus will likely first attempt to beam solar power from an aerial platform before aiming for space. Ultimately, solar power harvested in space and beamed to aircraft could revolutionize aviation, the company thinks. Flying aircraft could also serve as mobile nodes transmitting the power wherever else it might be needed on Earth.

""This could in fact be a game changer for aircraft, with the potential to extend the range, reduce the weight, but also to relay power to other places, managing energy like data,"" Jean-Dominique Coste, a senior manager at Airbus' Blue Sky department, which develops innovative technologies, said in the statement.

Space-based solar power could also help wean the world off fossil fuels and contribute to a zero carbon future in line with calls of the international climate science community. Scientists believe that in order to prevent the planet from warming on average by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), the global economy would have to be fully decarbonized by 2050. However, this goal is still not within reach, according to a recent United Nations report on climate change .

""Power beaming technologies would enable the creation of new energy networks in the sky and could help solve the energy problem,"" Coste said. ""They would enable countries to fully control and distribute their energy where needed, independently.""

Solar power energy generation is much more efficient in space than on Earth's surface, where clouds and the day-night cycle prevent achieving maximum illumination. In fact, solar radiation is 50% more intense in space, where no air stands in the way of the rays. However, the technology is not without its drawbacks.

""If satellites were to collect the sunlight, they would need to measure about 2 kilometers [1.2 miles] across to achieve the same power level as a nuclear power plant,"" Thueux said.

And nothing of that size has ever flown in space. The largest space-borne structure ever assembled in orbit is the International Space Station , which is about the size of a football field.

Coste said that the microwave beams that carry harvested solar energy ""can be designed to prevent harm"" to technology as well as living creatures. He sees further advantages of the system in its ability to distribute power all over the world without the need for any further ground-based infrastructure.

""There is no need for complex and costly ground infrastructure, power plants, pipelines or cables, for example, to distribute the electricity on Earth,"" Coste said. ""That, too, is done by power beaming.""

The system would not be more expensive than conventional ground-based power generation infrastructure, such as nuclear power plants or large-scale solar or wind farms, according to Airbus.

Considered the realm of science fiction until recently, space-based solar power has been gaining more prominence lately with the world's leading space agencies launching development projects and feasibility studies that could lead to the first space-based energy harvesters flying in the next decade.

The space agencies admit that advances in several areas, including robotics and in-orbit manufacturing , would be needed to make space-based solar power visions a reality."

Here we speak to Airbus engineer Paolo Artusio about how the ESM-1, the European Service Module which will propel the Orion spacecraft to the Moon, took shape.

For Artusio, the moment a programme transitions to its assembly, integration and test (AIT) phase is: “When engineers’ dreams leave their hands and begin to become reality.”

Artusio is the ESM’s AIT leader, and he will oversee this important evolution with four of the European Service Modules (ESMs) that Airbus is supplying for the NASA Orion spacecraft which will return humans to the Moon.

The Airbus-built ESMs are to provide propulsion, power, water, oxygen and nitrogen for crews aboard the NASA Orion spacecraft in flights to the Moon, and potentially beyond. It marks the first time this space agency has entrusted a non-U.S. company to build a mission-critical element for an American human spaceflight mission. Airbus developed and produces the ESMs under contract to the European Space Agency.

Details count in the ESM’s assembly, integration and test

The ESM is a highly-complex spacecraft, with the Airbus teams responsible for the assembly, integration and test of more than 20,000 parts and components that are used in each service module. This includes the full range of space hardware, from electrical equipment to engines, solar panels, fuel tanks and life support supplies, as well as approximately 12 kilometres of cables.

Orion ESM FM1 Delivery

Built as a cylindrical structure, the ESM has five major elements: the upper and lower platforms, the longeron, the square panel and shear panel. Its AIT process involves the Airbus teams bringing these components together and fitting all the vital elements needed for crew life support (providing power and such other commodities as water, oxygen and nitrogen), along with propulsion for in-space manoeuvering.

“The ESM is really compressed – both in terms of how tight everything is fitted into the cylinder and how the AIT programme is tightly scheduled from the timing point of view,” Artusio says.

A sustained programme pace for Orion ESMs

The first module, ESM-1 (christened “Bremen,” in honour of the Airbus facility where it was designed and built), was delivered to NASA in November 2018. Airbus provided the second ESM to NASA in October 2021.

ESM-3 is advancing through the integration phase in Airbus’ Bremen clean room facility, including such initial subassemblies as the thermal control system and the propulsion system harnesses.

The fourth ESM’s primary structure was delivered in recent months by Airbus’ subcontractor, Thales Alenia Space, and is being readied for its own cycle of assembly, integration and test activity.

A career in assembly, integration and test

Artusio has been involved with assembly, integration and test activities through much of his 34-year professional career in the space industry, which started with a work/study opportunity as a student in Torino, Italy.

“The Roman philosopher Seneca is quoted as saying: ‘Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity,’"" Artusio explained. “I’ve had many great career opportunities that I attribute to my dedication at work, bringing me to this dream job with a prime contractor for a programme that literally opens a new era of space exploration.”

“I’ve had many great career opportunities…bringing me to this prime contractor for a programme that literally opens a new era of space exploration.”

Paolo Artusio, Airbus space division’s AIT leader

Artusio’s expertise has perfectly positioned him for the AIT challenges that come with the European Service Module’s complexity – and the fact that human lives depend on its operation. He was previously involved in such projects as the Airbus-built Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) cargo resupply spacecraft that serviced the International Space Station and on which much of the ESM design is based, along with the Columbus laboratory which is permanently attached to the Earth-orbiting facility.

Artusio is proud to have this key role in a project that underscores Europe’s prime contractor contribution to the U.S.-led Artemis programme, which comes 50 years after the first crewed Moon landing in 1969.

The Copernicus LSTM Expansion mission moves a step closer to helping climate change adaptation - Airbus,"Mon, 07 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTExLXRoZS1jb3Blcm5pY3VzLWxzdG0tZXhwYW5zaW9uLW1pc3Npb24tbW92ZXMtYS1zdGVwLWNsb3Nlci10by1oZWxwaW5n0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"@AirbusSpace @ESA_EO @CopernicusEU @CDTIoficial #NextSpace #SpaceMatters #CopernicusSentinel

Madrid, 7 November 2022 - The Land Surface Temperature Monitoring (LSTM) programme led by Airbus has successfully passed the Preliminary Design Review (PDR). The approval of this milestone with ESA confirms that the satellite design is compliant with all mission requirements ensuring that mission objectives and user needs will be met.

LSTM is part of the Copernicus programme established to fulfil the need amongEuropean policy-makers to access accurate and timely information services to better manage the environment, understand and mitigate the effects of climate change and ensure civil security. LSTM addresses three key climate elements of concern: farming and food security, irrigation and water scarcity, and urban heat islands and energy efficiency.

“By measuring global temperature exchanges, LSTM will help shed light on how to adapt to climate change, particularly in support of agriculture management services. It is the first Copernicus mission awarded to a Spanish company and the third ESA mission to be primed by Airbus, after CHEOPS and Ingenio,” said Luis Guerra, responsible for Airbus Space Systems in Spain. “The programme development is on schedule thanks to a huge team effort and we are on track for launch of the first of the two satellites in 2028.”

The main objective of LSTM is to enable global monitoring of the evapotranspiration (ET) rate at field scale by capturing the variability of Land Surface Temperature (LST), allowing more robust estimates of field water productivity. This is a key parameter which can be usedto improve water resource management in agriculture to secure food production. Water productivity and irrigation efficiency are difficult to measure in situ at scale, this is why Earth observation satellites are needed to quantify these processes. Water stress in plants can be determined with thermal infrared (TIR) observations, days and even weeks before it becomes noticeable in visible and near infrared observations. This information can help farmers to use natural resources more effectively in a more sustainable manner.

As a complementary objective, thermal observations offer a wide range of additional services by monitoring drought and land degradation, urban heat islands and excess heat generation in city areas (power stages, warnings to older and physically weaker individuals, smart urban developments), cryosphere health (permafrost, glacier lakes), coastlines, coral reefs and inland water management and natural hazards (fires, volcanoes).

LSTM is one of the six Copernicus Expansion Sentinel missions being developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Commission. The contract, worth €390 million, was signed in November 2020. In its role of mission prime, Airbus Defence and Space in Spain is responsible for the satellite design, integration and test, up to the point of in-orbit commissioning and transfer to operations. Airbus leads an industrial consortium of 87 subcontractors on the programme across 19 European countries.

The mission includes two identical satellites, each one with a mass of 1,300 kg and a power generation capacity of 1,600 Wh. Both satellites will fly in a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellation at 651 km with local observation time at 13:00 over Europe, which corresponds to the highest stress time for crops. The minimum lifetime of each satellite is seven years but the satellite’s components are designed to last for 12 years, potentially operating up to and beyond 2040.

The Toulouse site of Airbus in France is responsible for the instrument design, integration and testing up to delivery to the satellite prime. The state-of-the-art thermal infrared instrument is being developed in Toulouse and will be the first spaceborne instrument to implement the thermal infrared-5 band at 12 microns enabling provision of 20 times greater spatial and temporal resolution (400 pixels of 50x50m fit into the 1000x1000m pixels of previous missions) and a revisit time of just two days at the equator.

The satellites will be compatible with the European launchers Vega-C (nominal) and Ariane 6 (backup) with the first launch planned for 2028 and the second for 2030.

Overall, Airbus is responsible for the spacecraft or payload on three out of six new generation Copernicus Environment and Earth observation missions: LSTM, CRISTAL and Rose-L, and is providing critical equipment to all six.

The Copernicus Sentinels are a fleet of dedicated EU-owned satellites, designed to deliver the wealth of data and imagery that are central to the European Union's Copernicus environmental programme. The European Space Agency is in charge of the space component, responsible for developing the family of Copernicus Sentinel satellites on behalf of the European Union and ensuring the flow of data for the Copernicus services, while the operations of the Copernicus Sentinels have been entrusted to ESA and EUMETSAT, the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites. Six new missions were selected in 2020 to join the fleet of Copernicus Sentinels and expand the current capabilities.

Airbus is building a hydrogen fuel-cell engine for aircraft - Engadget,"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZ2FkZ2V0LmNvbS9haXJidXMtcmV2ZWFscy1oeWRyb2dlbi1wb3dlcmVkLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWZ1ZWwtY2VsbC1lbmdpbmUtMTQyMjU2MjI1Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As part of its goal to have zero-emission aircraft enter service by 2035, Airbus has announced the development of a hydrogen fuel-cell engine designed for airplanes. Unlike Rolls-Royce's recently announced jet engine that burns hydrogen directly, it would use an electric motor just like fuel-cell cars, while emitting only H20. It could eventually be employed in commercial aircraft that could carry up to 100 passengers around 1,000 nautical miles (1,150 miles), the company said.

Airbus plans to test the engine by the middle of the decade on its A380 MSN1 aircraft, ""currently being modified to carry liquid hydrogen tanks,"" it said. However, the technology appears to be designed for smaller, regional type aircraft that use more efficient propeller, rather than jet engines.

""Fuel cells are a potential solution to help us achieve our zero-emission ambition and we are focused on developing and testing this technology to understand if it is feasible and viable for a 2035 entry-into-service of a zero-emission aircraft,"" said Airbus VP for zero-emission aircraft, Glenn Llewellyn.

The company didn't provide any more details, but fuel-cells are a well-known technology for cars. They're far less efficient than battery electric vehicles (BEVs) if you count fuel production and conversion to electricity. However, they have more range, are faster to refuel and lighter — with the latter, of course, being essential for aircraft.

As mentioned, Rolls-Royce just announced the successful test of a jet engine powered by burning hydrogen directly, another possible technology for future air transport. The company converted a Rolls-Royce AE 2100-A, a regional aircraft engine used in turboprop commuter planes, to work with the novel fuel source. However, the tech could theoretically be scaled up for larger planes.

There are still some major hurdles to overcome before hydrogen could ever be used to power airplanes. It takes four times as much hydrogen as regular fuel by weight for the same range, and the fuel must be kept under pressure. And of course, hydrogen is highly explosive, so aircraft systems for storage and distribution would need to be extremely reliable and durable — again adding weight. Still, it might be the only option available for aircraft in the near future, as battery technology is still much too heavy unless used for very short flights."
Airbus unveils hydrogen engines to be tested on the A380 - AeroTime,"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMzI4MDEtYWlyYnVzLXplcm8tZS1oeWRyb2dlbi1lbmdpbmVzLWEzODDSAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZXJvdGltZS5hZXJvL2FydGljbGVzLzMyODAxLWFpcmJ1cy16ZXJvLWUtaHlkcm9nZW4tZW5naW5lcy1hMzgwL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On day one of the Airbus Summit 2022 on November 30, 2022, the manufacturer unveiled its hydrogen-powered zero-emission engine. The fuel cell power plant will be considered as one of the potential options for the emissions-free aircraft that is scheduled to enter service in 2035.

The turboprop-like engine will convert hydrogen into electricity to power itself.

“Fuel cells are a potential solution to help us achieve our zero-emission ambition and we are focused on developing and testing this technology to understand if it is feasible and viable for a 2035 entry-into-service of a zero-emission aircraft,” said Glenn Llewellyn, the Vice President of Zero-Emission Aircraft at Airbus. According to Llewellyn, such technology-based engines “may be able to power a one hundred passenger aircraft with a range of approximately 1,000 nautical miles”.

“By continuing to invest in this technology we are giving ourselves additional options that will inform our decisions on the architecture of our future ZEROe aircraft, the development of which we intend to launch in the 2027-2028 timeframe,” he added.

ZEROe demonstrator

The propeller engine was not the only propulsion system to be revealed by Airbus, as the ZEROe demonstrator was also rolled out.

According to the planemaker, the fuel cell engine will begin ground and flight tests in the middle of the decade. It will power the ZEROe demonstrator, which is a to be converted Airbus A380, Manufacturer’s Serial Number (MSN) 1. The double-decker will have a fifth engine installed on the upper left side of the aircraft just behind the wing. Airbus is currently modifying the jet to carry liquid hydrogen tanks and fuel distribution systems.

The ZEROe demonstrator will also be equipped with a hydrogen combustion engine, akin to a regular jet engine seen on today’s aircraft. Much like the propeller power plant, the combustion engine will be mounted along the rear fuselage and coupled with a hydrogen distribution system. The difference is that liquid hydrogen will be transformed into a gaseous state and introduced into the engine via combustion, powering the aircraft throughout flight.

The combustion engine will be a modified General Electric (GE) Passport, a derivative of the CFM LEAP turbofan. CFM, a joint version of GE and Safran Aircraft Engines, will modify the Passport for it to be able to run on hydrogen.

“The A380 MSN1 is an excellent flight laboratory platform for new hydrogen technologies. It’s a safe and reliable platform that is highly versatile to test a wide range of zero-emission technologies,” said Mathias Andriamisaina, Airbus’ ZEROe Demonstrator Leader.

According to Andriamisaina, the platform of the double-decker is safe, reliable, and highly versatile. Due to its sheer size, the aircraft “can comfortably accommodate the large flight test instrumentation that will be needed to analyze the performance of the hydrogen in the hydrogen-propulsion system,” he added.

The hydrogen tanks, combustion engine, and distribution system will be tested on the ground individually and then collectively, the manufacter said. If all goes well, the hydrogen-powered Airbus A380 will take to the skies for a flight test, which is expected to take place in the next five years.

On November 28, 2022, Rolls-Royce announced that the company and easyJet had completed the first-ever hydrogen-powered regional jet engine test, using the Rolls-Royce AE2100-A engine."
Airbus pays 15.9 mn euros to close French corruption probe - Tech Xplore,"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHhwbG9yZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLTExLWFpcmJ1cy1wYXlzLW1uLWV1cm9zLWZyZW5jaC5odG1s0gFDaHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoeHBsb3JlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjItMTEtYWlyYnVzLXBheXMtbW4tZXVyb3MtZnJlbmNoLmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The company in January 2020 reached a plea bargain to pay a total of 3.6 billion euros.

A French judge on Wednesday allowed European aerospace firm Airbus to pay 15.9 million euros ($16.4 million) to avoid a corruption probe into aircraft deals in Libya and Kazakhstan between 2006 and 2011.

Prosecutors from France's national financial crime unit (PNF), which reached the deal with Airbus earlier this month, said the fine was ""fair and appropriate"".

They had earlier highlighted the ""repeated character of corrupt activities"" by the plane giant, but said the firm had cooperated on the ""dated"" allegations.

Making the payment—the same amount paid to go-betweens during the suspect aircraft deals—allows Airbus to avoid acknowledging criminal activity, meaning it can continue to bid for public contracts.

The company in January 2020 reached a plea bargain to pay a total of 3.6 billion euros ($3.7 billion at current rates) in fines to Britain, France and the United States to settle corruption claims over several contracts involving middlemen.

But the company said earlier this month that the Libya and Kazakhstan probe had not been covered by that agreement ""because of procedural issues"".

The payments dated back to a ""bygone era"" at Airbus, PNF chief Jean-Francois Bohnert said.

In one case, investigators looking into suspected illegal financing by Libya of Nicolas Sarkozy's 2007 campaign for the French presidency noted a 2006 sale of 12 Airbus planes to the regime of Moamer Kadhafi.

Three weeks after the deal was closed, a transfer of two million euros was made to a known middleman, Alexandre Djouhri, by a former Airbus executive who was charged last March.

Sarkozy, who has faced a string of legal inquiries since leaving office in 2012, has denied any illegal campaign financing from Libya.

The other corruption inquiry involves suspected kickbacks for several contracts between France and Kazakhstan in 2009 and 2010, while Sarkozy was president.

The deals included the purchase of two satellites from Airbus' former Astrium unit, where investigators discovered traces of an 8.8-million-euro payment to a Singapore account held by a Hong Kong-based offshore vehicle, Caspian Corp.

Caspian is linked to a Tunisian middleman, Lyes Ben Chedli, who was charged in July 2021 along with a former Airbus executive, Olivier Brun.

Keeping Europe's offshore wind parks running - Airbus,"Wed, 09 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTExLWtlZXBpbmctZXVyb3Blcy1vZmZzaG9yZS13aW5kLXBhcmtzLXJ1bm5pbmfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"During last year’s European Rotors, Airbus announced the delivery of a five-bladed H145 to the German Operator HTM Helicopters – a year on, we sat down with the operator to check how the helicopter has proven itself in this industry.

Helicopters are an important tool for the offshore wind industry – whenever maintenance of a wind park is necessary, whether it is planned or unplanned, helicopters are able to bring technicians and material in under one hour to wherever they are needed. The deployment of offshore wind energy is at the core of delivering the European Green Deal. The installed offshore wind capacity in the EU was 14.6 GW in 2021 and the ambition of the European Union is to increase it by at least 25 times by 2030, using the vast potential of the five EU sea basins*. To keep the offshore wind parks running, helicopters are an important asset to transport technicians and material quickly to the place where they are needed – to keep Europe’s offshore wind parks running.

H145

Sea State 6? No problem!

“If maintenance is required, time is money – every hour a wind farm is not operational, the wind park operator loses money”, says Remco Siemerink, Pilot and Manager Offshore at HTM Helicopters. “We can bring and hoist the technicians and the material needed to maintain the wind farm in less than an hour. Even in conditions up to Sea State 6, which is considered a very rough sea with waves of up to six metres – a wave height at which the helicopter is the only available means of transportation that is still able to do the job.” A typical crew for such a mission consists of two, one pilot and one technical crew member, who takes care of the technicians (of which there are usually up to three) and is also responsible for hoisting them to and from the wind turbine. “One mission usually takes around one hour – we fly 20 – 30 minutes to the wind turbine, hoist the three technicians and their equipment, which only takes us around one minute per hoist cycle, and fly back. The same the other way around in the afternoon.” To perform those missions safely, the helicopter is equipped with many features that support the pilot. “Helionix is great and intuitive – you always get the information you need and there are many options to customise the screens for the mission ahead. The 4-axis autopilot helps us to stabilise the helicopter, which is especially important when we are hoisting our passengers.”

H145

2000 missions and counting

HTM Helicopters, that has been flying a four-bladed H145 since 2014, took delivery of the latest version of the helicopter family with its innovative bearingless main rotor system a year ago: “The five-bladed H145, which we operate from our base in Norddeich to fly to Borkum Riffgrund 1+ 2 and GodeWind 1+2 has proven to be the ideal helicopter for our missions. The increased useful load compared to the previous version gives us an additional margin, while the smoother ride is great for both crew and our technicians on board”, adds Siemerink. In the last year, the five-bladed H145 has successfully completed more than 2000 missions, clocking more than 400 flight hours. “The performance of the H145 is great. In both summer and winter, the H145 is very powerful - we have no problems at all.” The unobstructed cabin is also a plus for the H145, which allows the crew to hoist both technicians and equipment one after another towards the windfarm. “With other helicopters you often cannot do that, as you have a separated passenger and cargo compartment.”

In the offshore wind business since 2008

“We operate a fleet of three H135s and two H145s for the offshore wind part of our business in Germany and France. Our main bases are Helgoland, Emden and Norddeich in the north of Germany and we recently added a new one in France at La Baule airport, which is close to Nantes”, says Siemerink. Last year alone, the H135 and H145 fleet clocked more than 1300 flight hours. “The current energy crisis has shown that renewable energies are the future and with wind parks becoming bigger and being located farther away from the coast, we expect the helicopter to play a vital role in supporting and maintaining them.”

Some older jets will be phased out as the new ones arrive.

Overall, compared to 2022, the development of the fleet will represent a 73% capacity increase in Available Seat Kilometres (ASK) on the ITA Airways network. This growth is mainly driven by capacity on long-haul routes, which will grow by 107%, the Alitalia successor said in a statement issued on November 11.

New intercontinental destinations are expected to open in 2023, it added, with direct flights from Rome Fiumicino to San Francisco and Washington Dulles in the United States starting from the summer season, and to Rio de Janeiro International from November, besides other long-haul connections launched in 2022.

According to the ch-aviation fleets module, it has seventeen A330-900Ns on order in total, to add to its existing widebody fleet of six comparatively new A350-900s (with a further four A350s on order) and eight older A330-200s (aged 12.6 years on average).

With the introduction of the A321-200NX(LR) next year - it has nine on order - ITA also plans to open several new destinations in the Middle East, including Jeddah International, Riyadh, and Kuwait.

ITA Airways currently operates a fleet of 68 aircraft, and besides the widebodies these include four A220-300s (and another twelve on order), eighteen A319-100s (with one more to be delivered), and thirty-two A320-200s. The A319s are aged 16.3 years on average, the A320s 15.2 years. All of the aircraft in the fleet are leased except for one A319 and two A320s. By the end of 2023, ITA will have 96 aircraft, half of which will be new.

The still-state-owned flag carrier has yet to turn a profit, but it said it remained committed to achieving two fundamental objectives - satisfying “all customers’ needs” and a “growing increase in profitability.” It added: “The expansion of the fleet represents a further step forward in ITA Airways’ growth strategy which will lead the company to be the greenest airline in Europe in 2026 with 80% of the fleet made up of new generation aircraft.”"

Airbus Spools Up For Dual A380 Demonstrators - Aviation Week,"Mon, 07 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvYWlyYnVzLXNwb29scy1kdWFsLWEzODAtZGVtb25zdHJhdG9yc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has provided more details about the accelerating design work underway on two A380 technology demonstrators targeting advanced propulsion evaluations for next-generation single-aisle aircraft planned for the 2030s.

The multinational OEM is collaborating with CFM International—the joint venture between GE Aerospace and Safran Aircraft Engines—on two major flight-test programs that will run almost concurrently. One A380 will be used to evaluate a GE Passport engine modified for direct combustion of hydrogen fuel while the second will flight-test the open-fan propulsion system being developed under CFM’s Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) program.

Hydrogen tested as separate system

Loads and noise part of open-fan tests

Although neither aircraft is due to enter flight testing until after the middle of this decade, work on the two sophisticated demonstrators is underway, says Frank Haselbach, head of propulsion engineering at Airbus. “The teams are spooling up,” he adds. “We’re having good cooperation with CFM on both programs, so we’re quite happy about that.”

The RISE and hydrogen flight-test campaigns form part of Airbus’ technology push toward a “ZEROe” carbon-neutral airliner for entry into service by 2035. The modified A380s will be used to conduct tests in the second half of this decade at the company’s flight-test facility in Toulouse. Before the A380 test flights, CFM will perform engine ground tests, along with flight-test validation on GE’s Boeing 747-400 flying testbed at GE Aerospace’s Flight Test Operations center in Victorville, California.

Haselbach says the hydrogen test effort is aimed at understanding “how we actually make sure that we have a safe or safer operation than today with such a sustainable aircraft—and that includes things like liquid hydrogen, because with gaseous hydrogen you wouldn’t get the range.” Speaking to Aviation Week on the sidelines of an International Society for Air Breathing Engines meeting in Ottawa, he adds that areas of focus will include tests of higher-density liquid hydrogen, storage tank and fuel system distribution technology, ground and flight operations, fueling infrastructure and combustor design.

“But to really make this meaningful, we decided to put it toward a flight test,” he adds, “which also helps to drive the teams together and gets us thinking about how we get this integrated into the aircraft [and] how we make it safe for flight, even in an experimental environment. So that was the key decision here.”

Haselbach stresses that the A380 hydrogen testbed—modified to carry the Passport engine on a pylon projecting from the aft fuselage of the A380 while the interior will be equipped with liquid hydrogen tanks—is still “a technology demonstration” and by no means a product. “It will give us the answers we need, and working toward a flight demonstration helps to actually do it with the right focus,” he says.

“We could have done it on a smaller platform than an A380, but it will be good to actually have more space,” Haselbach adds. “Also the layout of the fuselage structure enables us to have a reasonably short distance between the tank and the engine, so all of that actually helped a little bit. In addition, you can almost set up the entire hydrogen test system as a separate section or area on the aircraft. We’re not going to be interacting with any of the other systems, so rather than modify the fuel and propulsion system on an existing aircraft, it made a lot more sense to develop this as a pure flying testbed.”

The RISE demonstrator on the A380 is aimed at testing the potential fuel-burn savings from CFM’s open-fan configuration and will be the first single rotating and stator-stage tractor configuration of its type to be flight-tested at full scale. “We’ve seen the fairly promising concept of the open fan before in the 1980s and 2000s, so this is really the third time,” Haselbach says. “Clearly, it is a promising offering because you have a single fan rotating rather than two counter-rotating. That makes noise management easier, and the mechanics are simpler.”

Building on previous open-rotor and propfan concepts and demonstrators, the RISE takes the approach to new levels, he adds. “Now you have the adjustability of the fan and the stator, and that gives you effectively a high-performance sort of low-pressure system at a good sort of cruising Mach number,” Haselbach says. “The second stage takes the swirl out, so that’s the key benefit. Otherwise, a normal turboprop would actually fall off [in performance] at around Mach 0.6 or thereabouts.”

The open-fan demonstrator will be fitted with a large support pylon on the No. 2 inboard left engine test position. The inboard wing structure and adjacent areas of the fuselage will also be reinforced to accommodate the CFM engine, which is currently expected to feature a rotor diameter of about 13 ft.

“We will be looking at the aerodynamic integration of that concept because it’s quite a big fan,” Haselbach says. “So, specifically, this means studying how it will interact with the lift-drag ratio of the wing and the structural interaction in terms of the moments [when] an open fan generates extra forces.” Other areas will include acoustic evaluations in terms of community and cabin noise as well as monitoring interactive noise generated between the fan and the stator.

“From what we have seen so far of this in simulation, the first set of work is quite promising,” Haselbach says. “Not everything is solved, but it’s actually good enough to say: ‘Okay, let’s have a closer look.’ And that’s exactly what we have decided to do together.”"

Samer Halawi, chief executive of Airbus HAPS said the companies plan to offer 4G/5G low latency mobile services “at unprecedented economics.”

“Our innovative, record-breaking, green-energy-powered, platform is attracting interest from multiple mobile network operators and satellite and other service providers globally,” Halawi said.

Airbus launched the HAPS business in July of this year to commercialize service from the Zephyr platform. Airbus sees potential for HAPS to bridge the digital divide, and claims that one Zephyr has the coverage equivalent to that of 250 cell towers and can enable direct-to-device connectivity.

Space Compass is a new joint venture between Sky Perfect JSAT and Japanese telco NTT working to establish an integrated space computing network, including an optical data relay service.

This collaboration follows after Airbus began a study earlier this year with NTT, DOCOMO, and SKY Perfect JSAT to examine the feasibility of HAPS-based connectivity services in a future space-based wireless connectivity ecosystem."
Airbus Offers South Korea A ‘Win-Win’ Strategy To Export Its FA-50 Fighting Eagles To Western Europe - EurAsian Times,"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1vZmZlcnMtc291dGgta29yZWEtYS13aW4td2luLXN0cmF0ZWd5LXRvLWV4cG9ydC_SAVVodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJhc2lhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9haXJidXMtb2ZmZXJzLXNvdXRoLWtvcmVhLWEtd2luLXdpbi1zdHJhdGVneS10by1leHBvcnQv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Defense and Space, headquartered in Germany, has offered Seoul a “win-win strategy” to boost the sales of South Korea’s FA-50 Fighting Eagles and other fighters to Western European countries.

The proposal was made by Michael Schoellhorn, CEO of Airbus Defense and Space, during a meeting with South Korean Industry Minister Lee Chang-yang in Seoul. Both sides are also exploring ways to strengthen collaboration in aviation, space, and other mobility industries.

The Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy of South Korea stated on November 16 that Airbus proposed a “win-win strategy” that would involve exporting South Korean aircraft to Western European nations.

However, neither Airbus nor South Korea specified to which nation they would particularly want to export FA-50 in western Europe.

Schoellhorn stated that Airbus would raise the volume of components it imports from South Korea from the current 700 billion won (US$529.3 million) per year to over 1 trillion won.

He raised the prospect of expanding space collaboration with South Korea. He pledged to share information about its collaborative project cases with the European Space Agency regarding South Korea’s intention to establish a space agency.

The South Korean minister welcomed selling South Korean military aircraft in Western Europe. Lee also commended the Airbus CEO for the proposal to increase imports of South Korean aviation parts and requested that the firm order new items.

Seoul has exported FA-50 to several nations. The FA-50 Fighting Eagle is developed in collaboration between Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) and Lockheed Martin. It is a multirole fighter derivative of the ‘T-50’ line of aircraft, which includes supersonic trainers, light combat aircraft, and multirole fighters.

The aerospace sector of South Korea has grown considerably in recent years. The country recently signed a deal with Poland for the sale of 48 FA-50 FA-50 light attack aircraft, and it also successfully conducted the flight tests of the homegrown KF-21 stealth fighter jet.

Airbus To Build A R&D Facility In South Korea?

The South Korean Minister asked that Airbus establish a research and development facility in South Korea to improve collaboration in next-generation aviation industries.

Lee highlighted South Korea’s cutting-edge infrastructure and technology regarding semiconductors, displays, batteries, and software. China, India, Singapore, and Malaysia are home to Airbus’ international research and development facilities in Asia.

The ministry said that the head of Airbus clarified that his company would provide details about South Korea’s request to establish an R&D center. Lee urged to have more South Korean companies in Airbus’ aviation projects.

He suggested that more South Korean companies participate in Airbus’ aviation projects from the beginning and be considered major partners rather than just vendors.

The ministry also suggested Airbus put up specific proposals for areas where both parties could collaborate, like 3D printing and resin transfer molding. Lee promised to take deregulatory actions, tax, and other incentives to create “the world’s best investment circumstances.”

Seoul’s Growing Footprint In Europe

The East Asian nation has already established itself as a prominent weapon supplier to other countries, including Australia and India. In the past half-decade, South Korean defense companies have sold small guns and mobile howitzers to several European nations, including Turkey and Poland.

In July, Poland struck a record-breaking $5.8 billion deal with two South Korean firms. The agreement comprised 980 K2 Black Panther tanks, 672 K9 self-propelled howitzers, and 48 FA-50 fighter jets. It is believed that if all of the possibilities are activated in the coming years, the deals may be worth up to $15 billion.

In October, Poland decided to purchase 288 Chunmoo multiple rocket launchers from the South Korean company Hanwha Defense. South Korea’s defense sector has long developed weaponry and ammunition that are interoperable with American equipment. The two nations are anticipated to fight alongside each other in any battle with North Korea or China.

As a result, it is an appealing alternative for NATO members looking to rearm quickly and affordably. President Yoon Suk-yeol stated in August that his objective is to position South Korea among the top four global weapons producers, competing with the United States, Russia, and France for international deals.

According to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the country is currently the world’s eighth-largest defense exporter, with exports increasing by 177% between 2016 and 2021.

It is said that the country will receive more orders from European countries. Late in September, the top military official from Estonia visited Seoul for the DX Korea 2022 trade show and to meet with his South Korean counterpart. South Korean company Hanwha Defense has already received an order from Estonia for 18 K9 self-propelled howitzers.

That being said, a partnership between South Korea and Airbus would be a huge step forward for the nation’s domestic military-industrial complex and might expand the country’s involvement in European defense initiatives."

China Aviation Supplies Holding Company (CAS) signed a General Terms Agreement (GTA) with France-based Airbus to buy 140 aircraft on Friday, the same day as the visit to China by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.The 140 Airbus aircraft will include 132 A320 series aircraft and eight A350 aircraft, with a total value of about $17 billion, according to an announcement posted on the official website of CAS.The company said the move is partly down to the recovery in China's air transport market, and the likelihood of steady and rapid growth in the future.Airbus aircraft will be purchased in batches in order to adapt to the development of the aviation market and meet the needs of enterprises' transportation capacity, the company added.The framework agreement was signed on the same day as the arrival in China of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for his official visit. Scholz is leading a high-level business delegation to China as part of his visit.He is the first European leader to visit China since the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and the visit is set to further enhance the mutual understanding and trust between the two sides and deepen practical cooperation in various fields.China is an important trading partner for Germany and for Europe as a whole. Germany firmly supports trade liberalization and economic globalization, and opposes decoupling. Germany stands ready for closer trade and economic cooperation with China, and supports more mutual investment between Chinese and German businesses, Scholz said.The framework agreement also came after three state-owned airlines - China Southern, Air China and China Eastern - announced in July a deal with Airbus to buy 292 aircraft valued at around $37 billion in total, a deal that shows economic and trade ties remain tight and are mutually beneficial between China and Europe, experts said. The aircraft are expected to be delivered between 2023 and 2027.China and Europe are partners not rivals, with close economic connectivity and strong complementarity, and bilateral cooperation is far greater than competition, Wang Wenbin, spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry, said in October.Last year, China-EU trade exceeded $800 billion for the first time while bilateral trade this year has been resilient, despite the pandemic, inflation and geopolitical conflicts.The Chinese aviation market has seen a gradual recovery this year. The Civil Aviation Administration of China said the recovery of major transportation indicators for the industry in the third quarter was higher than in the second quarter.Three major Chinese air carriers are expected to fly more than 140 overseas routes with the winter/spring season having started on October 30. Although flight activity is still far behind pre-pandemic levels, experts said that it shows the regulator's efforts to gradually restore confidence in civil aviation.CAS specializes in the procurement of aircraft and the provision of aviation supplies. The scope of the main business involves aircraft batch purchases, aviation leasing and airport service support.Global Times"

The two H145s are in addition to the current fleet of 15 H145s and three H135s already ordered in 2020. All 20 helicopters will be delivered to the customer by the end of 2024; 11 of them have already been delivered to the customer. They have already begun replacing older BK117 and EC145 helicopters.

“Our mission is to continuously improve medical care for people in need. To achieve this, DRF Luftrettung operates the most modern helicopters available, now being the largest H145 operator in Europe. With the new Airbus contract we further enhance our ongoing fleet modernization thus setting the course for the future,” says Achim Vogel, head of Central Purchasing and Logistics at DRF Luftrettung.

The tailored HDataPower pack is a set of digital services designed to improve flight availability and operational safety. “By leveraging the data generated from helicopter systems, Connected Services provide in-depth analysis of flight, maintenance and logistics operations and set the stage for improvement actions and time savings. Prime examples are Flight Analyser, which supports operational safety, and connectivity devices such as wACS, our wireless airborne communication system,” says Christoph Zammert, Executive Vice President of Customer Support & Services at Airbus Helicopters. “We’re honored to help boost DRF Luftrettung operations, allowing them to carry out their important daily missions.”
