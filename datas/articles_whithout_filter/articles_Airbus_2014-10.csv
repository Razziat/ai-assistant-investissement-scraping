Airbus Defence and Space submitted a formal application for civil certification of its unmanned aerial vehicle, Atlante, to the European Aviation Safety Agency, the body responsible for certifying all aircraft in Europe.







The Atlante is a single-engine, propeller-powered UAV weighing over 1,200 pounds and has a wingspan of over 25 feet. It can take on a variety of commercial roles, including surveillance of oil pipelines, power lines, railways, natural disasters, forest fires or sporting events.







Airbus and EASA will now work together to develop a certification process to set the standards for UAV certification in Europe.







“UAVs represent a rapidly growing activity in commercial aviation that will have a very significant economic impact in the near future,” says Miguel Ángel Morell, head of engineering for military aircraft at Airbus. “The launch of the Atlante application will help EASA to secure a world-leading position in the establishment of the appropriate regulatory framework under which such systems will be designed, produced and maintained.”

The world's two largest commercial aircraft manufacturers are at odds over equipping airliners with black boxes that eject in the event of a crash, making them easier to find.

Airbus is nearly ready to equip airliners with data and cockpit voice recorders that eject so that they can float to the ocean's surface instead of becoming trapped in wreckage, Pascal Andrei, the French aircraft maker's chief product security officer, told a forum of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday.

Boeing, Airbus' chief rival, has no plans to include such recorders in its planes, Mark Smith, an accident investigator for the aircraft maker, told the safety board. Such recorders are prone to ejecting accidentally and creating a safety risk, he warned.

Black boxes are equipped with an emergency locator transmitter that would be easier to detect if they are floating on the water's surface.

Questions about whether airliners should be equipped with deployable black boxes arose after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared in March. The Boeing 777 with 239 people on board still has not been found. The purpose of the safety board's forum was to explore new technologies that would better enable planes like Flight 370 to be tracked and found.

""We can say today that we are quite confident on this solution,"" Andrei said Tuesday. Airbus is working with its suppliers, he said.

""Something would come very soon after some more studies and assessments,"" he said.

A slide presentation provided by Andrei indicated Airbus plans to include the deployable recorders in its A350 and A380 airliners, which are designed for long-haul flights over ocean.

Based on previous searches for planes, Smith estimated there will be only one accident every 10 years involving a commercial airliner that crashes into the ocean and cannot be found for more than a year. On the other hand, five or six accidental ejections are likely each year, he said.

""Unintended (ejections) from a commercial airplane would not be an acceptable risk and would be a risk that we would have to manage,"" Smith said. ""We need to beware of the introducing unintended consequences into the large commercial fleet that is flying.""

Airbus launches new VIP widebody cabin-concept - Airbus,"Mon, 20 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNC0xMC1haXJidXMtbGF1bmNoZXMtbmV3LXZpcC13aWRlYm9keS1jYWJpbi1jb25jZXB00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

Introduces a new way to greater capacity, comfort and capability

Airbus’ VIP Summit cabin<br /> Launched with the ACJ330, the Summit concept features a VIP section – including a bedroom with ensuite bathroom, office, conference and dining room, as well as a working area – in the front of the cabin, with airline-style first-class and economy seating toward the rear

Airbus has launched a new VIP cabin concept, initially for the A330-200, offering a faster and more affordable way to the greater capacity, capability and comfort of a widebody for both private and government customers. Called Summit, the concept features a VIP section at the front of the cabin, and airline-style seating at the rear.“What most customers want in a widebody is the ability to carry more people and to fly them nonstop to the world, “ points out Airbus Chief Operating Officer, Customers, John Leahy. “The Airbus ACJ330 Summit delivers the greater capacity, comfort, and capability of a widebody, and will do so faster and more affordably than competitors, by using a modern and proven solution.”The Airbus ACJ330 Summit features a bedroom with ensuite bathroom at the front, followed by an office, a conference and dining room and a working area, and then airline-style first-class and economy seating at the rear.The airline-style seating would be installed in production, which is faster and more cost-effective, and the concept can be evolved to meet customer needs.Airbus’ A330 is one of the world’s most successful airliners, and is currently being produced at a rate of ten a month, the highest of any widebody. The A330 and A340 were launched as a joint programme, have won more than 1,700 orders to date, and more of them have been delivered (1497 to end-September) than any other widebody series.Airbus A330s and A340s have been chosen by more than 160 customers and operators around the world, which means that wherever an ACJ330 Summit customer flies there is likely to be another user nearby.The A330 achieves a robust reliability of better than 99 per cent, and is in-service as freighter and mult-role tanker transport (MRTT) versions - as well as with airlines and private customers.Airbus corporate jet operators are also backed by a worldwide support network that serves more than 500 customers and operators, as well as services tailored to their needs.Airbus has sold over 170 corporate jets to date, and these aircraft are flying on every continent, highlighting their versatility."
Made in Canada: Airbus Helicopters Canada turns 30 - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 27 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL21hZGVpbmNhbmFkYWFpcmJ1c2hlbGljb3B0ZXJzY2FuYWRhdHVybnMzMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters Canada (AHCA) is not a standard original equipment manufacturer (OEM) subsidiary. Now celebrating its 30th anniversary, the Fort Erie, Ont.-based company has claimed an impressive 50 percent of all helicopter deliveries in the country since it was established as MBB Helicopter Canada Limited in 1984.

But aircraft sales and completions are just one of five key operational capabilities at AHCA’s 135,000-square-foot facility. It also has a highly experienced engineering department that designs a range of components and modifications; a growing manufacturing component — in which the production of composites is a specialization; offers extensive customer support; and provides maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services.

AHCA is one of 21 Airbus Helicopters customer centers, which are strategically located across all five continents.

“What makes Airbus Helicopters Canada unique is the fact that we have one of the broadest ranges of activities of any Airbus Helicopters entity,” said Romain Trapp, president of AHCA, during Vertical’s recent visit to the company’s facility. “Airbus Helicopters Canada has five capabilities — completions, design, manufacturing, support, and maintenance — which makes this company very exciting.”



Romain Trapp, president of Airbus Helicopters Canada, chats with Vertical during our recent visit to Fort Erie. Trapp has been at the head of the company since July 2013.

It certainly appears to be an exciting time for the company, with Trapp’s appointment in July 2013 part of an era of change; AHCA is now an Airbus Helicopters center of excellence for the production of composites, and in February this year won an open contract to begin manufacturing composite engine cowlings for the Airbus Helicopters EC225 and EC725, creating an estimated 40 new jobs.

Today, AHCA supports over 180 operators in Canada who collectively fly more than 670 helicopters. And, despite the Canadian rotary-wing market currently going through a dip — seemingly part of a historical cycle between growth and contraction — Trapp said AHCA had every reason to look ahead with enthusiasm, especially with the EC225 cowling contract in hand.

“The contract win was key, because it was recognition of what we have been doing over the last 20 years — investing in composites — has been successful,” he said. “Winning this contract has also helped us smooth the slowdown of the helicopter activity in sales and repairs in Canada. The market is very cyclical and very seasonal, so having a manufacturing activity that’s serving the worldwide market helps spread our activity out over the year.”

Canadian Market a Utility Market

Trapp joined AHCA from American Eurocopter (now Airbus Helicopters, Inc.) where he served as executive vice president and chief financial officer. He said the sheer size of the Canadian market (the second largest civilian helicopter fleet in the world) and the remoteness of the majority of the operations were a couple of aspects that initially surprised him.

“Many of the missions actually are conducted pretty far north in Canada, meaning you are in the middle of nowhere,” he said. “What has made our products so competitive is the fact that we are very reliable. And when you fly in the middle of nowhere, the first thing that you need is the reliability of the aircraft.”



The company receives “green” aircraft from the Airbus Helicopters production lines in France and Germany, reassembles them, and performs the final completion work before delivering them to customers.

Comparing the Canadian and U.S. markets, he said they were both customer-focused and customer-driven, but differed in the sectors in which the aircraft were operated.

“The Canadian market is mainly a utility market — 90 percent of the helicopters are flying for utility missions,” he said. “In the U.S., it’s more spread around emergency medical services [EMS], offshore oil-and-gas, law enforcement and corporate. . . . But this creates specific challenges for Canada, because when you have a downturn on the utility market, there is no other market for the operators to offset this downturn.”

With that said, Trapp said the average age of the Canadian helicopter fleet — 29 years old — would provide opportunities through fleet replacement in the coming years, while a growing demand for light twin-engine aircraft, particularly in Western Canada, also offered significant growth potential for the company.

While the country’s deep ties with utility operations tie it to the growth and decline of sectors such as natural resources, they also mean that Canada is seen as a reference point for the worldwide utility market.

“When we develop an option that we want to be successful in the utility market, if it’s not successful in Canada, it’s not going to be successful worldwide,” said Trapp. “We’ve developed a number of utility kits, because we know the needs of our customers, and our parent company fully trusts us [to do so]. They usually tell us, ‘You are in charge.’ ”

Designing Solutions

AHCA holds over 400 supplemental type certificates (STCs) for various aircraft modifications, most of which are to enhance utility operations. The modifications are designed by the company’s relatively small, but widely experienced, engineering team, which also applies its expertise to a range of other tasks.

“We cover the whole spectrum — we deal with our own STC approvals, we design OEM parts, we customize customers’ aircraft to their specific needs, and support our production and composite manufacturing,” said engineering manager Peter Sharpe. “The variety of challenges that we have here is like nowhere else I’ve worked before.”



Airbus Helicopters Canada has invested heavily over the last five years in new composite technologies such as this autoclave — an oven for curing composites.

Many of the most popular STCs the department creates are for the AS350 AStar, and these include a wire strike protection kit, a vertical reference window, squirrel cheeks and high-visibility doors. Most of these have developed from customer feedback — whether in the form of general suggestions for improvements or more specific item requests.

“The big driver right now is what is being referred to as vertical reference operation, which is anything that will allow the pilot to see the ground, see the load, and see the cockpit,” said Regis Pierquet, director of programs and engineering. “So we need to come up with a solution that gives the pilot the most comfort, the most reactivity, and the most visibility.”

According to Pierquet, the extent of AHCA’s success in creating modifications for the AStar is seen in the fact that some of them have been integrated into the basic platform of EC130 T2 — such as the cargo doors, the enlarged reference window, and the battery location.

He said the department’s size gave it more flexibility to create modifications than a larger organization has. “For us it’s very easy to make prototypes, to make parts with the input from the floor, and reverse engineer them,” he said. “We’re not frozen in a very big structure.”

Pat Garofalo, supervisor of completions design customization, agreed. “In some bigger companies, you do a design, and you never get to see the end product,” he said. “Here we get to follow it through, and I’m on the floor almost every day checking up on my design — making sure it’s working, and that everybody’s happy with it.”

Composite Excellence

In addition to designing and manufacturing a wide variety of modifications, AHCA also manufactures components — chiefly composites – that are sent to Airbus Helicopters final production lines in Marignane, France; Donauwörth, Germany; and Columbus, Miss.

Considered a center of excellence for composite manufacture within Airbus Helicopters, it currently creates a wide range of components including engine cowlings and fairings for the EC130 and AS350 B3; stabilizers, end plates, hub caps and boarding steps for the EC135; and engine cowlings and boarding steps for the EC145/UH-72 Lakota.



Phoenix Heli-Flight’s new EC135 T2e gets its distinctive Northern Lights paint scheme applied in Airbus Helicopter Canada’s paint shop.

While the company has 28 years’ experience of creating composite parts, the past five years have seen it heavily invest in new technology, such as a Virtek laser for ply positioning, new ovens for curing and a computerized cutting table, that have made it a leading edge manufacturer.

“We’re really taking advantage of the technology that’s available to make us more competitive in the field,” said Dwyane Charette, director of global supply chain. “We’ve been able to mesh the technology with our past expertize to offer a quality product at a competitive price.”

The award of the contract to produce the EC225/725 engine cowlings, in which it beat 13 bids from external subcontractors, was a demonstration of just how competitive AHCA has now become in the global market.

The 40 jobs created by the contract’s award will add to the 235 employees at the facility, one third of which are working on the manufacture of composites. The current production rate of the Super Puma will see the facility creating over 100 parts a year (each cowling is produced in three parts). The new capability required a restructuring of part of AHCA’s facility, but with all the parts in place, production of the first part began in September, and is on schedule to be delivered in mid-December. The line is set to reach full production by the second quarter of 2015.

“It’s a major milestone and it really establishes for us the baseline that says, ‘Yes, we do this; yes, we do it well; and yes, we’re going to grow it,’ ” said Charette. “The group has certainly shown confidence in what we do, and that goes a long way in basically reinforcing that we can make parts for other divisions or externally — it doesn’t even need to be within the group. We’re open for business.”

However, Charette admitted that finding the right skilled labor to enable this growth is probably the biggest challenge — and not just because the company is looking to hire from within the local area.

“Nobody really goes to school for composite manufacturing,” he said. “It’s part of the AME [aircraft maintenance engineer] program, but [the program] doesn’t get into the manufacturing, it’s more the maintenance end. So a lot of what we had here was on-the-job training.”

Because of this, the company has initiated a training program for composite fabrication in alignment with the Canadian Consul of Aviation & Aerospace. When it gains recognition from Transport Canada, Charette said that it would become the first official composite fabricator program in the country.

But it’s not the first training partnership AHCA has in place. Together with the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) in Richmond, B.C., it offers airframe and engine courses, and similar programs through Ecole Nationale d’Aeronautique in St. Hubert, Que. Earlier this year, it donated an AS350 training aid to BCIT.

“It’s a little point of difference for us — we’re investing in our people, investing in the technology, and investing in the facility to bring all the pieces of the puzzle together,” said Charette.

Maintaining the Right Environment

According to director of quality assurance Mike Merritt, quality and safety are together one of the main pillars of the global Airbus Helicopters organization. “We have to make sure that the quality is in the products we’re delivering to the operators so that they have safe operations when they’re operating in remote areas, and then ensure that we have a work culture here of quality and safety across the board,” he said.

The standard of AHCA’s quality management system is reflected in its certification as a registered AS9100 facility, and it also received ISO 14001 certification in early 2013 in recognition of the environmental management system it has in place to reduce company waste and increase efficiencies.

“We’re now in the process of implementing a safety management system [SMS],” said Merritt. “We haven’t been mandated yet by Transport Canada because we’re not an operator, but we’re going ahead and doing it anyway. Most people on the flight line are aware of the philosophy of SMS, but now we’ll actually be able to use it and show the benefits of having that system in place.”



The company now produces cowlings for the majority of Airbus Helicopters’ civil helicopter line.

In tandem with that, AHCA is undertaking a lean manufacturing upgrade of its facilities, a process that Trapp said is about 70 percent complete. “The goal is to improve safety, the quality of our work, and the efficiency of our production processes,” he said. “It has really paid off, because I have been able to see significant improvements in these three areas already.”

In terms of maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) capabilities, AHCA can perform light maintenance to 12-year inspections, including the repair of blades and dynamic components, and conversion between models. Last year the company began offering the repair of the Starflex main rotor head, becoming the only entity outside of Airbus Helicopters in Marignane to offer that service.

Benoit Marcoux, director of repair and overhaul, said one of the biggest challenges for his department is to have a quick turnaround time for dynamic components and blades. “When a customer is down to have a gearbox overhaul, they need a quick solution — they don’t want to wait four or five weeks,” he said. “If you take three weeks it’s too much. So what we did is put together a rental pool to alleviate the problem — to minimize the downtime for the customer. We’ve adapted through the years to our customers’ needs.”

Marcoux said part of this adaption was in maximizing synergies with sister company Airbus Helicopters, Inc. — both in terms of sharing capabilities when needed, but also in working on a more regional basis, providing a convenient OEM maintenance solution to U.S. customers based near the border with Ontario.

On the West Coast, Trapp said AHCA is working to reinforce the link with Vector Aerospace, an MRO provider based in Richmond, B.C., that was acquired by Airbus Helicopters in 2011.

“The goal there is to better support our customer by using Vector’s capabilities,” he said. “They have very strong capabilities in MRO on the airframe side, in dynamic components and the engine — which is one of the key strengths of Vector.”

Trapp said that AHCA’s overall level of support is improving — through increasing the level of stocks, better forecasting and streamlining the supply chain — but admitted the company still had some progress to make. “It’s not at the level yet where we need to be. We are working very hard to improve the level of support — it is definitely one of the top priorities at our company.”



Depending on what the final completion requires, it can add between 25 to 50 percent to the value of the helicopter.

In For the Long Run

Today, when a customer takes delivery of an aircraft at Airbus Helicopter Canada’s facility in Fort Erie, all employees are invited to take part in a special ceremony to mark the occasion. Photographs are taken, speeches given, and the workers hear from the customer about the operations the aircraft will be used to perform. It’s one of the changes initiated by Trapp since his arrival at the company, and provides an opportunity for staff to interact with their product’s end user.

“I wanted to strengthen the understanding of every employee working for Airbus Helicopters Canada that whatever their job in the organization, they work for the customer and they are paid by our customers,” said Trapp. “They need to realize in the end that whatever they do — it could be in manufacturing, engineering or finance — all of them play a key role supporting our operators.”

The move has been well received by the company’s employees, many of whom have been with the manufacturer for most of their working lives. Among them is Bill Beam, who works as a supervisor – aircraft completion planner. He has been at AHCA since 1986 when it was MBB — and said the company had just 22 aircraft in the country at time. “It’s just gotten busier and busier and more work has come in as head office is realizing what we can do in Canada here — what we can produce.”

Explaining the appeal of working at AHCA, Tammy Brost, a quality assurance auditor who has been with the company for 26 years, said: “I think it’s the people — we all get along, we all work as a team for our product, and we all care about our product. I’m proud to work here. I’ve been proud ever since the day I started. I love it — I mean we put an aircraft together that’s up in the air flying. How wonderful is that?”

Part 2 of 3

Introduction

In Part 2 of our three-part 757 Replacement analysis, we take a close look at Airbus’ new 97 tonnes take off weight A321neo, revealed by Leeham News and Comment October 21. We call the 97t airplane the A321neoLR (Long Range); Airbus has yet to name the aircraft, which it began showing to airlines last week.

We analyze the A321neoLR’s capabilities and limitations when compared to the aircraft it intends to replace, the Boeing 757-200W. We have chosen to do so using a real airline configuration as opposed to an OEM’s typical seating layout. By comparing the 757-200W and the A321neoLR over the route structure that United Airlines is using the 757 today, we can better see the characteristics of the A321neoLR and what operational consequences the differences between the types would mean for the airlines. Before we start, a short recap of Part 1 about the 757 and its replacement candidates. Here is what we found:

the seating capacity of the A321 is within 10 seats of the 757-200 in a standard configuration; the 737 MAX9 is trailing with about 20 fewer seats.

the myth about the strong engines of the 757 is just that, a myth.

the good field performance of the 757 is coming from its wing more than any advantage on the engine side

the A321neo and 737 MAX9 were hindered in their capability to replace the 757 for long and thin international routes by characteristics that can be changed. For the A321neo, this may be accomplished with rather modest changes to Max Take Off Weight (MTOW) and tankage. For the 737 MAX9, more elaborate changes to the wing and engines are required, both hard to do.

Summary, Part 2

We will now look in detail on the changes Airbus is doing on the A321neoLR, what each change brings and any restrictions that remain.

We will also detail why we think it will be harder for Boeing to match the A321neoLR with a 737 MAX9 development.

We detail prime, present 757W long-thin routes.

We present 757W international, A321neoLR and 737 MAX9 ""long range"" configurations.

We provide economic comparisons such as Payload-Range charts and Fuel consumption per trip and per seat diagrams.

In the final Part 3, will look at Boeing’s alternative to an A321neoLR, a clean sheet New Single Aisle (NSA) and a prospective Small Twin Aisle (STA) design and how much such an approach would surpass the A321neoLR on medium and long haul networks and when it could be available."

IndiGo is India's largest airline with a market share of 32.6 percent. The carrier currently offers 540 daily flights connecting 36 domestic and international destinations.

The carrier flies only Airbus A320-series aircraft, of which it currently has 84 in service. The narrow-body jet first flew in 1987.

The A320neo is the latest version of the A320, and made its first test flight in September. It is scheduled to enter service late next year. Airlines have placed orders for more than 2,000 of the planes.

IndiGo's latest agreement adds to an existing order of 180 A320neo planes to expand its fleet and make it more fuel-efficient. Those jets will enter service with the airline in 2016.

Airbus has recently been able to top US rival Boeing in terms of orders, but is still lagging behind with regard to production volumes. Boeing's next-generation 737 MAX jet has also received more than 2,000 orders.

America’s Cup: Is Airbus Team USA’s ‘secret weapon?’ - CNN,"Thu, 23 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAxNC8xMC8yMy9zcG9ydC9hbWVyaWNhcy1jdXAtaXMtYWlyYnVzL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Follow us at @WorldSportCNN and like us on Facebook

Story highlights Airbus partners with Team USA to create high-tech yacht Part of Larry Ellison's multimillion dollar America's Cup bid Modern airplanes and yachts have similar rigid wings and sails Airbus also using shark-like skin on wings to improve air flow

CNN —

How often do you see sports stars looking to the heavens in search of a little inspiration?

They might be on to something.

That’s why the team hoping to build one of the fastest yachts on the planet is not looking to the water – but to the sky. Or to be more precise, the giant passenger plane flying overhead.

Oracle Team USA, the reigning America’s Cup champions, have revealed their unlikely “secret weapon” in the hugely prestigious sailing race is Airbus.

The aviation giant has partnered with billionaire businessman Larry Ellison’s sailing team to create what it hopes will be an unbeatable high-tech yacht in the next edition of the race in 2017.

But what does an airplane company know about boat design?

“If you look at it closer, sailing and flying share a common DNA,” said Airbus President and CEO, Fabrice Brégie.

“Look at the importance of wind forces on airplane wings, and wind forces on the sails of a boat. They even look alike. And the speeds in aviation and boating share the same unit – the knot.”

Planes on water

Indeed, gone are the days of heavy wooden yachts with single hulls and white billowing sails.

Today’s sleek carbon fiber multihulls are like airplanes on water, sitting high above the waves, with crew members wearing wetsuits, carrying oxygen tanks, and communicating via radio.

And much like aircraft, these feats of design have rigid sails, rather than conventional material ones.

With competing teams spending tens of millions of dollars on their America’s Cup bids, Ellison – a software entrepreneur with an estimated fortune of $48 billion – will also be digging into his deep pockets to create a state-of-the-art yacht.

“The America’s Cup is a boat race, but the design technology and engineering are very often the winning factor,” said team skipper Jimmy Spithill, who knows what he’s talking about – he also has a pilot’s license.

“They’re as much like airplanes as they are like traditional boats, so I know we’ll have a lot to learn from the engineers at Airbus.”

Rule Britannia?

Watching developments closely will be the British challengers – led by four-time Olympic gold medalist Ben Ainslie – who earlier this year launched their $134 million bid alongside their own secret weapon – the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton.

A keen sailor herself, the Duchess went head-to-head against her husband Prince William in a yacht race during their recent tour of Australia and New Zealand – emerging victorious 2-0.

It’s hoped she’ll not only pass on some of that winning spirit to Ainslie’s team, but also add the type of international luster so attractive to the world’s richest investors.

In the 163 year history of the race, Britain has never won the prestigious silver trophy. Adding insult to injury, the first competition took place on its shores in 1851.

Where sky and sea meet

Back across the Atlantic, work has already begun collecting data on the Team USA boat, with over 300 on-board sensors providing real time information to a main server.

They’re as much like airplanes as they are like traditional boats Jimmy Spithill, Team USA skipper

Much like its planes, Airbus will be analyzing the data closely.

“When they get a brand new plane for the first time, they fly it and log hundreds and hundreds of variables,” explained Oracle Team USA project manager, Ian Burns.

“They are testing it and trying to improve the airplane.” he said. “And this is exactly the same when we launch our boat and go sailing for the first time.”

Perhaps Airbus will also take away a thing or two from its new water-based collaboration.

Already, the company has introduced a ridged texture much like shark’s skin on its plane’s wings, to improve air flow.

The worlds of flight and sail are not so dissimilar as they might seem. And somewhere between sky and sea, the next America’s Cup will take place.

The decision came after lawyers representing the defendants moved to have the criminal case dismissed on human rights grounds because the accused had already been cleared by the French stock market regulator of similar allegations five years ago, in a case that dates to 2006.

All the defendants deny allegations that they were aware of serious problems with two major jet development programs when they sold shares in the European aerospace and defense company EADS, now known as the Airbus Group, in March 2006. That was three months before those troubles became public and the company’s stock price fell by more than a quarter in a single day, erasing nearly $7 billion in market value.

In a statement from the bench late Friday, Bénédicte De Perthuis, the presiding magistrate of the three-judge panel, said that she had agreed to submit the case for review by France’s Court of Cassation to decide whether new criminal trial is constitutional."
World's first Airbus A350 route will be Doha-Frankfurt - USA TODAY,"Mon, 20 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTQvMTAvMjAvd29ybGRzLWZpcnN0LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXJvdXRlLXdpbGwtYmUtZG9oYS1mcmFua2Z1cnQvMTc2NDQ0ODMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"World's first Airbus A350 route will be Doha-Frankfurt

The world's first-ever Airbus A350 flight with paying passengers will come on a route from Doha to Frankfurt.

The route for the aircraft's maiden passenger flight was revealed Monday by Qatar Airways, the launch customer for Airbus' newest aircraft. Qatar Airways is expected to receive its first A350 by the end of the year and anticipates making the first regularly scheduled flight to Frankfurt in January.

""Qatar Airways looks forward to inaugurating our first A350 on the Doha-Frankfurt route, and to very soon introducing this next-generation aircraft on many other cities offered on the airline's extensive network,"" Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker says in a statement.

Qatar Airways currently flies two daily round-trip flights between Frankfurt and its hub in Doha on a variety of aircraft, including Boeing 777, Boeing 787 and Airbus A330 aircraft. The carrier will convert one of those two daily flights to A350 service in January. The second flight will switch to A350 service ""shortly"" after, Qatar Airways says in its statement.

FlightGlobal.com notes that Qatar Airways ""had previously pointed to New York as a potential candidate for the inaugural route but subsequently backed away from a clear indication.""

Qatar Airways' A350s will have 283 seats, with 36 in business class and 247 in coach. The Doha-based airline has ordered 80 A350s and expects to have eight in its fleet by the end of 2015.

The A350 is the newest commercial passenger aircraft to be made by European jetmaker Airbus. The jet, more than half of which will be made from carbon fibers, is set to be delivered to launch customer Qatar Airways by the end of 2014.

The A350 – along with Airbus' recently announced update to its A330 widebody – is expected to help Airbus ratchet up competition against Boeing in the long-haul market, where Boeing's 777 and 787 ""Dreamliner"" models have enjoyed strong sales."

"Airbus, Boeing production gaps for the A330, 777 - Leeham News and Analysis","Sun, 19 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNC8xMC8xOS9haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tZ2Fwcy1mb3ItdGhlLWEzMzAtNzc3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus last week announced it will reduce production on the A330ceo from 10 per month to nine per month, beginning in 4Q2015. We predicted in 1Q2014 that the rate would have to come down, due to the sharp decline in the backlog beginning in 2016.

We also predicted then that Boeing will have to reduce the production rate on the 777 Classic due to its sharp decline beginning in 2017.



Boeing so far continues to claim that it can maintain its production rate at 8.3/mo right through the introduction of the 777X into service in 2020. We don’t believe it can. We’ve illustrated why we believe a rate cut is inevitable. Buckingham Research Group, in a note issued Friday following the Airbus announcement, neatly encapsulates the data in a single chart.

What’s important here is that BRG (as did we) includes orders, options and Letters of Intent for both the A330 and the 777 Classic–and there still are significant gaps between the current 777 and revised A330 production rates.

Airbus needs 337 orders (assuming 100% conversion of all options and LOIs, an unlikely prospect) to fill its order gap even at a reduced rate of nine per month.

Boeing needs 257 orders (assuming 100% conversation of all options and LOIs, an unlikely prospect) to fill its order gap at the current production rate.

Airbus still hopes to land an order for as many as 200 A330ceo “Regionals” from China, which would go a long way toward filling its order gap–if it happens. There is an air show next month in Beijing that would be a natural forum to make an announcement, but these opportunities have come and gone in the past.

Boeing currently has 25 777s Unidentified, which are factored into our analysis and into BRG’s. President Obama will attend a pan-Asian regional conference held in Beijing concurrent with the air show, and we expect a Boeing order announcement that probably will come out of the 930 Unidentified 737 orders, the 777 backlog and maybe some of the 25 Unidentified 787 orders.

With the EIS of the Airbus A320NEO and Boeng 737MAX around the corner, we are always asked about our thoughts on the Last-Off-The-Line aircraft and how they will depreciate vs the existing fleet. Based on these requests, we have looked at a few aircraft to see how they depreciated over the last 10-15 years. CV compared a 1999 Boeing 737-400 vs a 1999 737-800 as well as a 2004 Boeing 757-200 vs a 2004 Airbus A321-200. We felt the 757 would be an interesting aircraft to review as there really has not been a direct replacement for the aircraft as of yet.

As you will see from the chart below, the last 737-400 depreciated at a much faster pace than the 737-800. For the 737-400, the average year over year depreciation rate was around 12%. For the 737-800, the year over year depreciate rate has been 5.5% which is more in line with normal deprecation expectations. For the 757-200, the average annual depreciation rate was around 8.5% vs 5.5% for the Airbus A321-200 over the last 10 years.

So what does this all mean? Although the next last-off-the-line aircraft may not react in the same exact way, we can probably anticipate that they will depreciate at a faster pace than their new replacements. Cyclicality, amongst other factors, will also play a role in how quickly these trends take shape and depending on where the market is over the next 2-3 years, this may help or hinder the existing aircraft fleet.

(Click on each image to enlarge and get a crisp view.)

Current Market Values as a Percentage of the New Aircraft Price:

As mentioned in our last newsletter, many are asking whether or not we are at the peak of the cycle. In the charts below, we wanted to show the value and lease rate trends of 9 Yr. old aircraft (737-800, A320, and A321) since the peak of the last cycle. Why nine years old, you ask? Since the oldest 737-800 in 2007 was Nine years old, it was better to keep everything consistent and use the same vintage for the other aircraft. Although values have risen in the last 12 months, they are still not up to the levels seen in 2007. Lease rates have also been on the rise but they are also not back up to 2007 levels. Interestingly enough, A321 lease rates for nine year old aircraft have remained fairly stable over the last seven years. For the lease rates, please keep in mind that interest rates are much lower than in 2007 which means that they will not need to be as high as in 2007 to be comparable. In doing a quick payment analysis using 10 Year Swap rates in 2007 vs 2014, we found there to be a difference of about $20k-$30k per month in the lease rates when adjusting to the higher 2007 money cost. This puts still puts today’s lease rates lower than in 2007 for most aircraft but it doesn’t put them far off. Should the current trends continue, CV feels that lease rates may reach 2007 levels in the next 12-18 months if not sooner.

Current Market Value Trend for 9 Yr. Old 737-800, A320-200, and A321-200 (2007-2014):

Airbus Signs $1.7 Billion Contract for Six Metop Weather Satellites - SpaceNews,"Thu, 16 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS80MjIxMmFpcmJ1cy1zaWducy0xNy1iaWxsaW9uLWNvbnRyYWN0LWZvci1zaXgtbWV0b3Atd2VhdGhlci1zYXRlbGxpdGVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Airbus Defense and Space on Oct. 16 signed a $1.7 billion contract to build six polar-orbiting meteorological satellites for European governments, a deal in which guaranteeing strict work-share equality between Germany and France was almost as important as the satellite technology involved.

For Airbus, the contract for the Metop Second Generation satellites was a kind of revenge match against the same Thales Alenia Space-OHB AG team that had bested Airbus for Europe’s third-generation Meteosat geostationary-orbiting satellites.

Airbus and Germany protested putting Thales Alenia Space of France rather than Germany’s OHB in charge of managing the Meteosat contract, and the German government dragged its heels for months before accepting the European Space Agency’s decision.

To avoid a replay of that, France and Germany in 2012 agreed that each would take a 27 percent stake in the Metop Second Generation contract, and that whoever won would divide the work evenly between the two nations, with the other participating nations — Britain, Italy, Spain and Sweden — taking lesser roles.

The fact that the Metop contract was for two different payloads, with sounding and imaging instruments, made it easier to split the program down the middle to let the German and French teams each build three satellites.

Accomplishing this task would always be easier for Airbus, which maintains large satellite production facilities in both nations and, as an integrated company, can fine-tune work assignments.

As described by ESA Director General Jean-Jacques Dordain during the contract signing ceremony, Airbus and ESA have carved out a program that is about as evenly distributed as possible.

For the 1.3168 billion euros ($1.71 billion) in firm, fixed-price contract value, Dordain said, Germany will get 658.6 million euros in work share, and France will get 658.2 million euros. “Germany wins,” he said. “But not by much.”

“It’s nice to see good cooperation between France and Germany without having to go through another big political dispute as we did” for the Meteosat satellites, ESA Earth Observation Director Volker Liebig said during the contract-signing ceremony.

Europe’s meteorological satellite organization, the 30-nation Eumetsat of Darmstadt, Germany, is responsible for operating the satellites and for financing most of their construction and all of their launches.

The 20-nation ESA, as design overseer, pays a 70 percent share of the first two satellites’ construction. ESA has also paid for the early phase design work, bringing its total Metop Second Generation contribution to some 808 million euros.

Eumetsat expects to spend some 3.2 billion euros for its share of the first satellite models, the construction of the remaining four, the launch of all six satellites, the ground infrastructure and 20 years of operations starting in 2020.

The Metop satellites will gradually take over from the current Metop spacecraft, whose orbits are coordinated with similar satellites operated by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to provide morning and afternoon passes over the equator.

Eumetsat Director-General Alain Ratier said China, which now duplicates part of what NOAA does, appears ready to shift the orbit of its next-generation polar meteorological satellites to offer a more-efficient use of the three systems.

Francois Auque, director of space systems at Airbus, said all six satellites will use variations of the company’s AstroBus platform, which stretches from several hundred kilograms in launch mass for simpler optical Earth imaging satellites to the 4,000-kilogram range for the Metop Second Generation spacecraft.

ESA and Eumetsat had agreed to postpone the final contract award to give time to industry to design the Metop Second Generation satellites with enough fuel to assure their controlled atmospheric re-entry over the South Pacific.

Each satellite will carry more than 600 kilograms of fuel, two-thirds of which will be reserved to perform the deorbit maneuver at the end of their 7.5-year mission life. The deorbit is needed to remove the spacecraft from their 831-kilometer polar low Earth orbit, a heavily trafficked orbital region, to eliminate their risk as space debris.

Dordain and Ratier said the 30-year cooperation between ESA and Eumetsat, in which neither seeks to usurp the other’s role, is one reason Europe’s meteorological satellite program is rarely controversial, even when European governments are facing tight budgets. For the Metop Second Generation program, ESA governments actually oversubscribed, forcing the agency to reduce some nations’ roles."

"DCNS, Airbus Defense & Space to jointly develop a shipborne helicopter UAS - Defense Update","Tue, 28 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTQxMDI4X3RhbmFuLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Defense & Space and DCNS will jointly develop a shipborne unmanned helicopter to be seamlessly integrated into the ship’s combat system, extending the vessel's 'eyes and ears' into the sky.

Airbus Defence and Space (and DCNS signed a cooperation agreement today to develop a ship-based variant of Airbus DS TANAN unmanned helicopter Unmanned Aerial System. TANAN has been developed to address the naval sector’s specific requirements for an aircraft that would offer efficient integration onto all types of armed vessels. The companies believe this partnership will help to speed up the market release of the TANAN vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) tactical helicopter UAS, that has been in development for several years with Airbus’ former EADS conglomerate. The demonstrator’s first flight took place in 2010 and development is currently continuing according to schedule.

The cooperation between Airbus and DCNS will enable the integration of TANAN UAS into the ship’s combat system, including definitions of its mission systems and situational assessment, based on data received from the various sensors on board the UAS. Other aspects of the cooperation will include the physical integration of TANAN onto the ship, including the positioning and compatibility of the antenna system, the landing deck, the harpoon and grid landing assist, the docking and securing of the UAS in the hangar, as well as the related support.

As the vessel’s ‘eye in the sky’, TANAN will deliver full HD imagery and other sensory data straight to the combat information system

Under the work share agreed by the two companies Airbus Defence and Space will produce the entire certified unmanned aerial system, the vehicle with its payloads, the datalink and the UAS control station. DCNS will carry out the integration of the UAS on the ship and into its combat system, from the definition of the required functions and the interfaces with the combat system, to the production of corresponding UAS modules that will enable operations to be controlled via the ship’s command, to the on-board installation and implementation procedures.

DCNS has already integrated UAS on board some of the vessels it produced, under studies that began more than ten years ago, when it first aspired to integrate tactical UAS onto its entire range of vessels, from off-shore patrol vessels to frigates. Conceptual designs are also underway to integrate UAS into future submarines.

Providing an ‘eye in the sky’ for surface vessels, the helicopter provides full HD imagery delivered by multi-sensor EO/IR payload and a selection of complimentary sensors including maritime radar, AIS (Automatic Identification System), an IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) system, an electronic surveillance system and a direction finder. By integrating UAS onto combat ships, the latter’s detection range and ability to accurately identify threats can be increased, while simultaneously ensuring operational availability.

“DCNS will be the only company to offer both its current and prospective customers an integrated solution for operating a UAS that can be armed from on board a combat ship. In partnership with Airbus, DCNS offers reliable, functional and perfectly integrated solutions for naval combat platforms and systems,” said Pierre Legros, President of Surface Naval Systems at DCNS.

Designed specifically for maritime operations TANAN has a maximum take-off weight of 350 kg and a payload carrying capacity of 50 kg TANAN is powered by a diesel engine supporting missions with ranges of up to 100 nm (180 km), at temperatures of between -20°C and +50°C and in challenging weather conditions.

By integrating UAS onto combat ships, the latter’s detection range and ability to accurately identify threats can be increased, while simultaneously ensuring operational availability. The system is stored in a hangar on board and is operated by a single operator."
Virgin Atlantic launches first Dreamliner route - USA TODAY,"Tue, 28 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTQvMTAvMjkvdmlyZ2luLWF0bGFudGljLWxhdW5jaGVzLWZpcnN0LWRyZWFtbGluZXItcm91dGUvMTgxMDk3NzMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Virgin Atlantic launches first Dreamliner route

Virgin Atlantic launched its first Dreamliner route on Tuesday, flying its new 787-9 from London Heathrow to Boston and back.

The carrier's Dreamliner made its debut on Virgin Atlantic Flight 11, which departed London Heathrow at 5:42 p.m. and landed at Boston Logan International at 8:48 p.m., all times local. The Dreamliner then returned to London on Virgin Atlantic Flight 12, which took off from Boston at 11:30 p.m. and touched down in London at 9:50 a.m. Wednesday morning, all times local.

The flights marked Virgin Atlantic's first-ever Dreamliner flights with paying passengers. After debuting its first 787-9 on its Boston-London route, Virgin Atlantic also plans to put Dreamliners on routes to Washington Dulles, New York JFK and Newark Liberty in the coming months.

All told, Virgin Atlantic has 21 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners in order. Boeing's new-age long-haul jet will make up about half of Virgin Atlantic's fleet once the airline receives all the 787-9s it has on order.

""It is safe to call it a flagship aircraft for Virgin Atlantic,"" Craig Kreeger, the carrier's CEO, told Today in the Sky on Friday (Oct. 25) onboard the aircraft in Atlanta.

Virgin Atlantic has not yet announced plans to use the Dreamliner for its Atlanta service — the carrier began its first Atlanta flights on Sunday (Oct. 26) using Airbus A330s. But the airline flew its first Boeing 787 to the city on a special flight last week to show off the aircraft in the hometown of its new partner Delta, which purchased a 49% stake in the carrier in a deal that closed last year.

As for Virgin Atlantic, Kreeger says the Dreamliner will be a key element for the carrier to return to profitability. Virgin Atlantic has lost money in four of the past five years, according to CAPA Centre for Aviation. Yet Kreeger said he expects that to change this year.

""There is a sort of a line-in-the-sand moment that this aircraft represents for us,"" Kreeger said, referring to the 787-9. ""It represents, in my mind, the transition from our recovery mode to the future. And this airplane is going to be such a big part of that transition over the next several years.""

Virgin Atlantic intends to use its fuel-efficient Dreamliners to replace its aging and fuel-guzzling four-engine Airbus A340s, as well as some of its Boeing 747s, which also have four engines.

""As we go from having zero 787s to 21 … the result of that is we go from having an average-aged fleet of fuel-inefficient airplanes to a really young fleet of great fuel-efficient and environmentally (friendly) airplanes,"" Kreeger says. ""I think is very consistent, from a customer service standpoint of what we want to offer. And, from a cost standpoint, (it's) about what can make us successful.""

British entrepreneur Richard Branson, who founded Virgin Atlantic three decades ago and remains the company's majority owner praised his airline's newest aircraft.

""They just got every single little detail right,"" Branson told Today in the Sky on Friday from inside the Dreamliner at the same event in Atlanta. It smells good, looks good. The lighting, the seating, the ambience, the entertainment systems, the toilet — I mean everything is just brilliant."""

The Airbus Group NV's <air.pa> helicopter division expects to increase its annual sales in China to 150 units by 2020 from around 30-40 helicopters now, its China president Norbert Ducrot told Reuters.

Sales in the United States, the firm's biggest market, average around 120-150 aircraft per year.

""The China market is very small with a big potential,"" Ducrot said in an interview in Beijing. ""I am pretty sure around 2020, China will be the first market for Airbus Helicopters.""

""Before (our customers) were mostly state companies, police and fire fighting, but now we can see the emergence of civil private helicopter operators,"" he added.

China simplified flight approval procedures for private aircraft late last year, but the fledgling market for helicopters and small aircraft has been constrained by the military's control of low altitude airspace.

A dearth of small airports, maintenance facilities, mechanics and pilots have also hampered the sector's growth.

Ducrot said he expects demand for helicopters and small aircraft to pick up gradually when China starts to open up its low altitude airspace next year.

As infrastructure improves and the military opens up more airspace by 2020, Ducrot estimates there will be 50,000 helicopters in China over the next 30 years. There are only about 330 helicopters currently in operation in China, including Hong Kong.

Other small plane makers are also expanding to cash in on China's growth potential.

Textron Inc's <txt.n> Cessna Aircraft Company and Embraer SA <embr3.sa> have started assembling business jets in China, while Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation <gd.n> and Dassault Falcon <avmd.pa> are adding service and maintenance centers in China.

Airbus Helicopters is currently the market leader in China, with customers that include state-backed Citic Offshore Helicopter Co Ltd <000099.SZ>. In July, it announced an order for 123 helicopters to three privately owned Chinese general aviation companies, a deal that would effectively double the size of its fleet over the next five years.

In March, it also signed an agreement with Aivcopter, the firm's long-time government-owned partner, to jointly produce 1,000 EC175 models.

Industry observers say more than 200 general aviation companies, mostly privately owned, are lining up for regulatory approval in China.

Existing companies are also planning to expand their facilities. Beidahuang, China's biggest general aviation service provider, plans to buy over 40 planes and helicopters, increasing its fleet to around 130 by 2020.

The video shows activists inside Airbus’ offices and at a certain point police are called.

“Airbus writes on its website that ‘contributing to the wellbeing of the communities in which it works is an ethical imperative,’ but there is nothing ethical about profiting from Israel’s war crimes against the Palestinian people,” London Palestine Action states.

“Airbus has close ties with Israel Aerospace Industries, which is an Israeli state-owned company that is a key supplier of drones to the Israeli military. Drones were widely used in attacks on civilians during the recent Israeli attack on Gaza in which more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed,” the statement adds.

Airbus and Israel Aerospace Industries are currently working together to build a drone based on the Heron model extensively used in Israeli war crimes against Palestinians.

Among the companies’ other collaborations, London Palestine Action notes, are an “early warning system” for warplanes and a “semi-robotic pilot controlled vehicle” called Taxibot.

“Their collaboration also extends to several EU-funded scientific research projects. This year, they’ve announced their latest joint venture that will see them supplying the German military with drones until 2020,” the release states.

As The Electronic Intifada’s David Cronin revealed, EU officials have falsely portrayed grants to Israeli weapons makers including Elbit and Israel Aerospace Industries as being “civilian in nature.”

London Palestine Action calls itself “a network of people in London taking creative action against Israeli apartheid through boycotts, divestment and sanctions (BDS) campaigning and other solidarity actions.”

During last summer’s Israeli attack on Gaza, members of the group occupied the Cabinet Office, one of the key UK government buildings.

The group also succeeded in shutting down the UK subsidiary of Elbit until activists were forcibly removed by police.

Odds and Ends: Boeing firms 52/mo for 737; Product strategy; Aircraft demand and production rates - Leeham News and Analysis,"Thu, 02 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNC8xMC8wMi9vZGRzLWFuZC1lbmRzLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWRlbWFuZC1hbmQtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1yYXRlcy1wcm9kdWN0LXN0cmF0ZWd5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing firms 52/mo for 737: Boeing this morning announced what we reported in June 2013: that it will go to a production rate of 52/mo for the 737 in 2018. This will not be the last rate increase for the 737.

Airbus previously notified suppliers to be prepared for a rate of 54/mo in 2018 for the A320, which we reported some time ago.

Product strategy: In the continuing tit-for-tat in product strategy debate between Airbus and Boeing, often show slides representing their view of how their products line up vs The Other Guy. We’ve often criticized Boeing for taking liberties with how it views Airbus seat; for example, Boeing assigned fewer than 350 seats to the A350-1000, while Airbus now promotes the airplane as having 369 seats in a J/Y class configuration. Boeing assigns 467 seats to its 747-8I while Airbus to now viewed the 747-8 at 405 seats, a figure we generally use in our analysis to represent typical airline configuration.

Airbus recently showed the following slide presenting its current view of the product line up.

It’s certainly true that Lufthansa and Air China, the only two passenger airlines to receive and operate the 747-8, configure their airplanes with fewer than 400 seats and perhaps this is the basis for the Airbus representation.Airbus represents the 777X as carrying more passengers than the 748, and this certainly would not be the case in the event of normalized configuration. (But is does show how the 777-9X is killing the 748.)

However, we don’t understand how Airbus represents the A350 family as having more than 400 seats if the same configuration assumptions are used–and it is obvious to us that they are not.

The other airplane representations are reasonable.

Aircraft demand: Aviation Week has a detailed story about aircraft demand in the near-term, providing another take and a topic we’ve written about many times. (Continued below the photo.)

Aviation Week reports that some aerospace analysts believe the production rate of the Boeing 777 Classic should be reduced to as few as four per month. We see a decline in the rate inevitable, but we don’t see rates declining to this extent; we believe the rates will come down incrementally beginning in 2017 leading to the 2020 EIS of the 777X.

Some analysts also believe Airbus needs to reduce the rate of the A380 to one per month, according to the article. Airbus needs to deliver 30 A380s a year to achieve break even (a goal set for next year), which means Airbus will be delivering below its book-to-bill rate.

"Airbus Will Cut Production On Its A330 Jet, But No Job Losses Will Follow - Business Insider","Fri, 17 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vci1haXJidXMtdG8tY3V0LWEzMzAtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1yYXRlLWluLTIwMTUtMjAxNC0xMNIBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vci1haXJidXMtdG8tY3V0LWEzMzAtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1yYXRlLWluLTIwMTUtMjAxNC0xMD9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Expect to see more of these. Airbus

BERLIN (Reuters) - Planemaker Airbus will cut production rates of its A330 plane to nine a month from 10 in the fourth quarter of 2015 as it switches to a revamped version of the jet, the A330neo.

Airbus launched the A330neo at Britain's Farnborough airshow in July and it is due to enter service in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Analysts had expected a production cut to six or eight a month for the traditional A330 over the next couple of years although Airbus has said it would seek to keep production levels fairly stable through the transition to the new version.

A spokesman said the cut in production would not result in job losses because the group is also ramping up production of the A350 jet, which is due to enter service this year with launch customer Qatar Airways.

""With the recent commercial success we've seen following the launch of the A330neo, in addition to the new 242 tonne weight variant and the A330 optimized for regional routes, we are confident we will sustain a steady production towards the A330neo ramp-up period,"" Tom Williams, Airbus executive vice president programs, said in a statement on Friday.

European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has allowed the aircraft for ETOPS (‘Extended-range Twin engine aircraft Operations’) ‘Beyond 180 minutes’ diversion time, allowing pilots to fly the aircraft up to 370 minute with a single engine.

With this approval, the A350 XWB becomes the first aircraft type that receives such a level of ETOPS approval before its entry into service (EIS).

Airbus is expecting that it would receive its ETOPS certification soon. Approval also gives provisions for ETOPS 300 minutes and ETOPS 370 minutes depending on individual operator selection.

The second option allows the extension of the diversion distance up to 2,500nm, which equal to ETOPS diversion time of approximately 370 minutes, in case one engine becomes inoperative. However, according to the ETOPS rules, each airline has to get separate clearances.



""This authorisation clears the aircraft for use in new direct, non-limiting routings.""

The regulations of ETOPS decide the maximum flying time of the flight on one engine that allows it to fly from the nearest airport at necessary conditions.

This authorisation clears the aircraft for use in new direct, non-limiting routings.

The ETOPS 370 minute approval will allow airlines to operate the aircraft on direct southern routes such as between Australia, South Africa and South America. While the ETOPS 300 mininute approval will clear way for operation on transoceanic routes across the North and Mid-Pacific such as from South East Asia to US, and Australasia to the US.

The Airbus A350 is expected to enter service by the end of 2014.

A350 XWB is mid-size long range aircraft from Airbus’s widebody family and the company has received 750 orders for the aircraft as of September 2014.

"Airbus, DCNS to develop TANAN ship-based helicopter UAS - Vertical Magazine","Wed, 29 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1c2RjbnN0b2RldmVsb3B0YW5hbnNoaXBiYXNlZGhlbGljb3B0ZXJ1YXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DCNS and Airbus Defence and Space are partnering on the TANAN ship-based helicopter UAS. Airbus Photo

As part of the 2014 Euronaval exhibition, Airbus Defence and Space and DCNS signed a cooperation agreement on Oct. 28 in Paris to develop a ship-based helicopter UAS capability.

This technological partnership will help to speed up the market release of the TANAN vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) tactical helicopter UAS, as it takes into account the naval sector’s requirements and the aircraft’s efficient integration onto all types of armed vessels from the outset.

The work the two companies are doing will enable the TANAN UAS to be integrated into the ship’s combat system. This includes the definition of its mission system and the improvement of situational assessment thanks to the data received from the various sensors on board TANAN. The work likewise encompasses the physical integration of TANAN onto the ship, including the positioning and compatibility of the antenna system, the landing deck, the harpoon and grid, the docking and securing of the UAS in the hangar, as well as the related support.

Airbus Defence and Space will produce the entire certified unmanned aerial system, the vehicle with its payloads, the datalink and the UAS control station.

DCNS will carry out the integration of the UAS on the ship and into its combat system, from the definition of the required functions and the interfaces with the combat system, to the production of corresponding UAS modules that will enable operations to be controlled via the ship’s command, to the on-board installation and implementation procedures.

Airbus Defence and Space has been developing UAS for over 30 years for a wide range of civil and military applications, from the heavier Euro Hawk HALE and the Harfang MALE to the Tracker, DVF 2000 and Copter 4 mini-UAS, all the way up to the Atlante and TANAN tactical UAS and the Zephyr high-altitude pseudo-satellite.

DCNS is currently the only prime contractor for military vessels that is now able to offer a solution that is entirely in the hands of the commander and that enables central operations to deploy surveillance or armed UAS. Thanks to major ongoing investment in research and development in this area, DCNS is continuing with the trail-blazing work it began more than ten years ago, when it first aspired to integrate tactical UAS onto its entire range of vessels, from off-shore patrol vessels to highly armed frigates.

“This agreement underscores the high level of expertise associated with our TANAN program as well as our desire to provide the naval market with a perfectly matched system, in collaboration with our partner DCNS,” stated Jean-Marc Nasr, COO of Airbus Defence and Space SAS.

“DCNS will be the only company to offer both its current and prospective customers an integrated solution for operating a UAS that can be armed from on board a combat ship. In partnership with Airbus, DCNS offers reliable, functional and perfectly integrated solutions for naval combat platforms and systems,” said Pierre Legros, president of Surface Naval Systems at DCNS.

TANAN is a helicopter UAS with a maximum take-off weight of 350 kilograms, and is designed for maritime operations. Its characteristics, including extensive detection and identification capabilities, make it a considerable asset for surface vessels. It is thus suited to highly intense missions and combating asymmetrical threats alike. Flexible and versatile, with a powerful tried-and-tested diesel engine and state-of-the-art equipment, TANAN is a perfect addition to ship-based helicopters.

By integrating UAS onto combat ships, the latter’s detection range and ability to accurately identify threats can be increased, while simultaneously ensuring operational availability."

World's largest passenger plane gets more U.S. routes - USA TODAY,"Sun, 05 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTQvMTAvMDUvYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtcm91dGVzLXRvLXRoZS11cy1zdXJnZS1pbi0yMDE0LzE2NTk5NDgzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"World's largest passenger plane gets more U.S. routes

Travelers hoping to catch a glimpse of — or a seat on — the world's biggest commercial passenger plane in the U.S. will find more options than ever this year.

Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) became the latest U.S. airport to land service on the Airbus A380 last week, joining seven other U.S. airports that already have regular flights on the double-decked airliner.

The A380, so big that it's been dubbed a ""superjumbo"" jet, isn't new to the United States. It's been flying here since 2008, when Emirates — now the world's largest operator of the aircraft — made its maiden passenger flight on the A380 on a route from Dubai to New York JFK.

This year, the number of A380 routes in the United States has proliferated, with five airlines set to add seven new U.S. routes between August and December. That will grow the number of nonstop routes from the USA with at least seasonal A380 service to 22 by the end of 2014, a year-over-year increase of about 30%.

Industry experts say that's no surprise, since the number of A380s flying for airlines has steadily increased since 2007, when Singapore Airlines became the first to fly paying passengers on the jet.

The number of A380s flying for commercial airlines has tripled since 2010, going from 41 flying for four airlines that year to 142 across 12 airlines as of October this year. And Airbus says it has a backlog of 179 orders for A380s that it has yet to deliver, including 89 slated to go to Emirates. The world's biggest operator of the jet, Emirates already had 51 A380s in its fleet as of mid-September.

""Emirates has a lot of A380s and they need to put them somewhere,"" says Brett Snyder, author of The Cranky Flier aviation blog. ""They're growing all over the U.S.""

Similarly, other international carriers have looked to the U.S. as they've taken new A380s.

Snyder also notes that a number of big U.S. airports couldn't handle the oversize A380 when it made its debut in 2007, but have since made upgrades to accommodate the jet.

In 2010, New York JFK and Los Angeles were the only American cities with scheduled service on the aircraft. Since then, those airports have been joined by a half-dozen other U.S. airports. Miami, San Francisco and Washington Dulles all got their first regular A380 routes in 2011, followed by Houston Bush Intercontinental in 2012 and Atlanta in 2013.

DFW joined the list last week with new A380 service from two different airlines. Australian carrier Qantas gave the airport its first-ever regular A380 service Sept. 29, when it switched to A380s on its DFW-Sydney route, which is now the world's longest commercial airline route. Dubai-based Emirates switched to the aircraft for its flights to the United Arab Emirates from DFW two days later.

""It's been a fantastic week,"" Sean Donohue, CEO at DFW, said shortly after the airport's second A380 route commenced on Wednesday. ""We've really focused on improving the international profile of both the airport and the region. In many ways, it's been a milestone.""

Underscoring the A380's expanding footprint, there was a third new A380 route to launch within the U.S. last week. That came Friday, when British Airways put its A380s on one of its flights to Washington Dulles, given that airport its second route on the superjumbo.

Despite the influx of A380 flights to the U.S. on foreign carriers, however, no U.S. airline has yet to place an order with Airbus to the jet. And most industry experts don't expect that to change.

With nearly 180 orders for still outstanding from overseas carriers, the number of A380 flights to the U.S. is only likely to increase, says Alan Bender, Professor of Aeronautics at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida.

""There's plenty of room left,"" Bender says of the outlook for A380 routes to the U.S. ""We still do not see A380s on the vast majority of major routes to Europe and Asia from the U.S. There's a lot of room for growth. A lot.""

Against that potential, U.S. airports are doing what they can to accommodate the A380. Many still must undertake upgrades to be able to handle the aircraft's extreme height and wingspan.

DFW, for example, spent about $4.5 million to reconfigure two gates so that the airport could handle simultaneous A380 flights. The airport has made other improvements, such as adding about 250 seats to its A380-capable gates and making modifications to ramps and taxiways.

Other airports are making similar moves. Among those, Boston's Logan International Airport, which says a $100 million renovation on its Terminal E includes upgrades that would allow it to accommodate the A380's height and wingspan.

""International flights are the largest growing sector at Logan,'' Massport CEO Thomas Glynn said in announcing the initiative. ""We need to do our part to keep up with the industry and our carriers' needs.""

Using British Airways as an example, Massport — the agency that operates Boston Logan — noted the carrier can seat about 170 more passengers on the A380 than on the 747s and 777s it currently uses on its routes to Boston."

Additively manufactured titanium components are now onboard the Airbus A350 XWB, Concept Laser announced.

The bracket connector used in the Airbus A350 XWB was honoured as a finalist in the running for the “2014 German Industry Innovation Award”. In the eyes of the jury, this cross-industry project is revolutionising the way structural aircraft components are made and lightweight construction is implemented in civil aircraft, Conept Laser said.

Additive manufacturing causes new synergies to emerge

Previously this component was a milled part made of aluminium; now it is a printed part made of titanium with a weight reduction of greater than 30%. The arguments for the laser melting of metals in aircraft construction are geometric freedom and weight reduction. The “lightweight construction” approach is intended to help airlines operate their aircraft more economically. A new aircraft design requires thousands of flight test installation brackets, which are produced in very small unit quantities. Additive layer manufacturing allows designers to come up with new structures. According to Concept Laser, the additive components are in fact more than 30% lighter than conventional cast or machined parts. The omission of tools reduces the costs and shortens the time until the component is available for use by up to 75%. Since tools are not required in the process, it's now possible at an early stage to produce functional samples of components that are similar to series produced components. Peter Sander, Head of Emerging Technologies & Concepts, Airbus, Hamburg: “Previously we budgeted around six months to develop a component – now, it's down to one month.”

Fear of Landing – Five Airbus A350-XWB in Formation - Fear of Landing,"Fri, 03 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vZmVhcm9mbGFuZGluZy5jb20vbWlzYy9maXZlLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXh3Yi1pbi1mb3JtYXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This week had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for plane spotters: Five Airbus A350-900 test aircraft flying in formation. The Airbus A350-900 received its type certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The FAA certification will follow.

The A350-900 Type Certification comes after successfully finishing a stringent programme of certification trials which has taken its airframe and systems well beyond their design limits to ensure all airworthiness criteria are fully met.

The A350 XWB (Xtra Wide-Body) is the first Airbus to have a fuselage and wings made primarily of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer. The A350-900 series seats 314 passengers nine abreast and has a range of 14,350 kilometres, almost the distance from New York to Brisbane.

Airbus say that the A350-XWB is 16% lighter manufacturer’s empty weight (MEW) per seat and uses 25% less fuel. The A350 is expected to enter service by the end of the year.

The prototype A350 first flew on 14 June 2013 at Tolouse-Blagnac Airport in France. Now, just over a year later, the A350 hyas its type certification.

The test aircraft collected over 2,600 flight test hours over 600 flights. As a celebration of the type certification the five A350s performed a formation flight at the end of their programme.

It is usually much too expensive for commercial aircraft to be used for formation flying so this is quite a sight to behold.

The video was filmed using a sixth aircraft, a Corvette, which chased the five A350-XWBs."
Airbus in supersonic jet link-up - Professional Engineering,"Wed, 01 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmltZWNoZS5vcmcvbmV3cy9uZXdzLWFydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWluLXN1cGVyc29uaWMtamV0LWxpbmstdXDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Articles





Airbus is partnering with a US start-up to design a supersonic business jet which is planned to be in the air by 2019.

The European aerospace group’s defence and space arm will work with the Nevada-based Aerion Corporation to commercialise the company’s research into supersonic flight, which has focused on developing a wing design capable of up to 90% supersonic natural laminar flow (SNLF).

Laminar flow is the smooth, uninterrupted flow of air over a wing. Aerion says its wing design halves friction drag over the wing compared with conventional swept or delta wings, increasing power, lowering weight and improving fuel efficiency, thereby making supersonic flight commercially viable.

Doug Nichols, chief executive of Aerion, said: “This agreement provides validation from the industry leader in aerospace innovation and kicks the programme into high gear.Aerion moves quickly toward building a supersonic jet, and Airbus gains access to more than a decade of successful research and proprietary, high-performance aircraft technology.”

Aerion’s first aircraft, which Airbus will help develop and certify, is the AS2. The plan is for the aircraft, which was launched earlier this year, to take its first flight in 2019 and enter commercial service in 2023.

The AS2 is an update of a 10-year-old twinjet business jet design. It features three engines and a very thin, unswept wing, tapered with a sharp leading edge and a slightly curved airfoil. The aircraft will cruise at Mach 1.6, and have a take-off weight of 52,200kg and a range of 8,800km.

Aerion’s research into SNLF can be traced back to US defence research during the 1990s. To commercialise the research, the company was formed in 2002. Last year, it conducted, with Nasa, flight tests of the wing design, which the company said were “a conclusive demonstration of the viability of SNLF and its ability to generate great efficiency while travelling at supersonic speeds”.

According to reports, senior Airbus engineering staff will move into Aerion’s offices in Reno, Nevada, to provide support in aerodynamics, structures, fly-by-wire flight controls and certification planning. Aerion will provide access to its proprietary technology and assist in high-performance aircraft development in the longer term.

Jean Botti, chief technical officer of Airbus Group, said: “Aerion’s pioneering work has broad applications for both performance and efficiency. We are looking forward to a fruitful collaboration.”

Aerion predicts that the market for supersonic business jets will be between 400 and 600 aircraft over the next 15 to 20 years."

The company, which launched last year, currently services 17 destinations in West Africa with its fleet of four leased aircraft, including three Airbus A-319s and an Embraer 170. It will open domestic routes next month with two Q400 NextGen aircraft purchased from Bombardier last year. ""We have retained the two companies with whom we continue the discussions, and at the end of October we'll take a decision on our future fleet,"" CEO Rene Decurey said in an interview on Tuesday. Air Cote d'Ivoire plans to add three more aircraft by 2016, he said, adding that Boeing and Brazil's Embraer had also been involved in the initial talks to supply planes for the expansion through either leases or purchases. A future agreement would also include the eventual replacement of the four aircraft currently being leased. ""All four constructors propose new generation aircraft...For us it was important to know what these new generations could offer us in terms of fuel consumption, reliability and regarding the comfort of our passengers,"" Decurey said. Air Cote d'Ivoire is 65 percent state-owned, with Air France holding a 20 percent stake. Ivorian private investors Goldenrod hold 15 percent. Decurey said the company plans to raise its capital from 25 billion CFA francs ($48 million) to 65 billion CFA francs by the end of the year. The Ivorian state will inject 20 billion CFA francs and the West African Development Bank will become a shareholder with an injection of 2 billion to 5 billion CFA francs, he said. Goldenrod will maintain its 15 percent stake in the new arrangement, but Air France has not yet decided whether it will inject capital into the airline, he said.

Airbus A350-900 receives certification - Airline Ratings,"Wed, 01 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLTkwMC1yZWNlaXZlcy1jZXJ0aWZpY2F0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has received certification from European authorities for its new A350-900, the company’s answer to the Boeing 787. The Type Certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) was received on September 30th. The certified aircraft is powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification will follow shortly.

The A350 is a medium to long range twin-jet that can carry between 250 and 350 passengers in a typical international configuration depending upon model. Like the Boeing 787 it is made of carbon-fibre rather than the traditional aluminium. This brings a host of benefits to passengers such as lower cabin altitude and higher humidity to virtually eliminate jet lag. It competes with Boeing’s 787 and 777.

To celebrate the event Airbus launched all five test aircraft into the skies over Toulouse France for some formation flying. See the spectacular video below.

“Receiving the A350-900 Type Certification from EASA is a great achievement for Airbus and for all our partners who have contributed to designing, building and certificating this fantastic, new generation aircraft. The A350-900 is now ready to fly from the nest and be enjoyed by airlines and passengers,” said Fabrice Brégier, Airbus President and CEO. “The A350 XWB embodies many extra innovative technologies which make all the difference in passenger comfort and airline efficiency.”

“The A350 XWB manufacturing programme has also been innovative and ambitious aiming for a fully mature aircraft at entry into service and this is what we are proud to be delivering to our first A350 XWB customer, Qatar Airways, before the end of the year.”

Mr Mr Brégier added that the fleet of five test aircraft completed the certification campaign, on time, cost and quality. “Accumulating more than 2,600 flight test hours, we created and successfully achieved one of the industry’s most thorough and efficient test programmes ever developed for a jetliner.”

The A350-900 Type Certification comes after successfully finishing an extensive programme of certification trials which has taken the airframe and systems well beyond their design limits to ensure all airworthiness criteria are met.

At the end of May 2014, the A350 XWB had secured 750 orders from 39 customers worldwide."

It is Qatar Airways first A350-900, production number MSN006, which is towed between the different finishing stations at Toulouse.

What is left to do is finishing off the interior, then ground tests and flight tests. The finishing of the interior to Qatar’s standards can be a painstaking process, especially as this is the first time that their interior (which surly has several items which you don’t find in Airbus normal A350 interior catalog) is build together in the aircraft.

Fitting a customer interior for the first time is something which is time-consuming as one is at the same time collecting every bit of feedback for possible adjustments of the fittings, seats etc for later builds. Making it for Qatar makes this even more delicate, they are perfectionists when it comes to the interior finish. Parts that don’t fit perfectly or have surface faults will be removed and go into an adjustment process, everything being painstakingly documented to quickly come down the learning curve. We can be sure Airbus and Qatar’s interior teams and B/E Aerospace (who as far as we know makes the premium seats) are working long days in the weeks ahead (and has done so for some time). The interior of MSN005, the rout proving aircraft with a standard Airbus catalog interior, took two and a half months in the interior stations, this aircraft has been in these stations for different interior fittings since May and will continue for some further weeks.

Production sequence

Qatar will receive the first eight A350 off the production line with production numbers MSN006 to MSN013. One can expect the first batch of eight Qatar A350 to have been delivered before third quarter next year. Then follows Vietnam Airlines with four aircraft and then Finnair with three.

Airbus Celebrates With Formation Flight - AVweb,"Tue, 07 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF2d2ViLmNvbS9yZWNlbnQtdXBkYXRlcy9idXNpbmVzcy1taWxpdGFyeS9haXJidXMtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy13aXRoLWZvcm1hdGlvbi1mbGlnaHQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus often celebrates milestones with media events and the recent EASA certification of its A350 XWB airliner resulted in a pretty impressive formation act. Airbus launched its five flight test A350s and flew a formation routine that resulted in a neat video. The big airliners were shot in a variety of relatively intricate maneuvers, sometimes at low altitudes, that must have been quite a sight from the ground, too. Reuters reported Tuesday that the FAA expects to certify the aircraft by the end of October.

While the video was clearly a lot of fun for all involved, the hard work of competing against Boeing’s 777 and 787 now gets its practical test. Airbus has been left behind in the lucrative 200-400-seat long range market but it also had the chance to learn from the troubled launch of the Dreamliner. It announced that the first A350s will be delivered with nickel-cadmium batteries instead of more energy-dense lithium ion but will switch to the lithium cells in 2016. Meanwhile the company is getting ready to deliver the first A350-900 to Qatar Airways by the end of the year."

Airbus aims Polish Orlik MPT at export market - Flightglobal,"Tue, 07 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWFpbXMtcG9saXNoLW9ybGlrLW1wdC1hdC1leHBvcnQtbWFya2V0LzExNDcwNS5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"More than four months after it performed the debut flight of Poland's enhanced PZL-130 Orlik MPT multipurpose trainer, Airbus Defence & Space has formally presented the aircraft for the first time.

Conducted at the 41st Training Aviation Base in Deblin on 6 October, the first official flight involved Krzysztof Galus, chief test pilot at Airbus's Warsaw facility, and Capt Dariusz Stachurski, leader of the Polish air force's ""Orlik"" aerobatic display team. The aircraft landed after about 15min in the air.

A first technical flight involving the Orlik MPT was conducted from Warsaw-Okecie airport on 23 May, following the completion of a two-month period of ground testing to check the functionality of its new glass cockpit, back-up avionics, airframe health and usage monitoring systems, antennas and electrical system.

By the time of its first public flight earlier this month, the Orlik MPT had spent about 30h in the air. Airbus says this testing has confirmed the basic operation of the aircraft's engine, hydraulics system, air conditioning, brakes and flap controls, as well as its radios, navigation equipment and flight instruments, along with its basic and emergency landing gear system controls. Pilots have also checked the ergonomics of new the cockpit configuration.

As a result of this work, the company has received permanent approval for flights in special category clearance from the Polish Civil Aviation Authority.

During the next phase of the programme, tests of the Orlik MPT's glass cockpit avionics functionality, automatic rudder trim system, engine anti-icing system and anti-skid braking system will be carried out, says Airbus.

Airbus Defence & Space

Deputy minister of national defence Czeslaw Mroczek says a market analysis for a glass cockpit upgrade to the Polish air force's PZL-130 Orlik TC-II configuration will be completed before the end of this year. The service is interested in acquiring 12 new aircraft, to enter into service from 2018.

Poland's current air force inventory includes 28 PZL-130s. Sixteen of these are in use in the upgraded TC-II standard, says Flightglobal's MiliCAS database, which records four TC-I-variant trainers as also in current use, with another eight not currently operational. It is expected that the service will upgrade its earlier aircraft to the MPT standard, which it also refers to as the TC-II GC.

Airbus officials have named Chile and Jordan as potential export customers for the Orlik MPT.

ANALYSIS: Airbus Helicopters revamps range for the future - Flightglobal,"Mon, 06 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYW5hbHlzaXMtYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLXJldmFtcHMtcmFuZ2UtZm9yLXRoZS1mdXR1cmUvMTE0NDA3LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At an as-yet undisclosed point in the fourth quarter, likely to be October or early November, Airbus Helicopters will deliver its most important new model, the clean-sheet EC175.

The 7.5t rotorcraft sits in the new super-medium segment and will compete initially against the in-service AgustaWestland AW189 and later, the developmental Bell Helicopter 525 Relentless. First delivery will mark the midpoint of a crucial period for the manufacturer as it revamps its civil range.

In the pipeline since 2008, the arrival of the Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6-powered EC175 has already been delayed on two previous occasions to allow the manufacturer to ensuret that its operations are ready for service entry.

Operators have been patient, although the EC175’s order total last year of just five aircraft suggests that well of goodwill is only so deep.

Three operators – Noordzee Helikopters Vlaanderen (NHV), Héli-Union and UTair – will take delivery of their initial examples this autumn as the airframer looks to ease the type into service.

Despite this glacially slow approach, Airbus Helicopters chief executive Guillaume Faury, speaking to reporters in early September, believes that momentum is now with the new rotorcraft.

A tour of the North Sea – including stops in Norwich, Aberdeen and Stavanger – was carried out in May, which Faury describes as “very successful”. Operators, he says, “see how they can take benefit from [this] aircraft and how they can position them”. Missions previously served by medium-weight helicopters are shifting to the super-medium class as rigs move further offshore, he notes.

Having previously highlighted the EC175’s poor 2013 sales total, Faury is confident that trend is reversing. “I believe that 2014 will be decent and 2015 will be brilliant,” he says. Orders this year are outstripping those in 2013, with commitments so far totalling 14 helicopters, including an additional six aircraft for NHV.

Future developments are also likely to include production of a military variant, despite previous insistence to the contrary. That said, Faury points out that Airbus Helicopters is “in no hurry” to militarise the platform. In the short term, he says: “We don’t see any tender where the EC175 would be the product of choice for military applications.”

Any future variant would also need to be developed outside the framework of Airbus Helicopters’ co-operation with its Chinese partner, Avicopter, which produces the main fuselage for the EC175 and is also creating its own variant of the rotorcraft, the Z-15/AC352 for its domestic market. Any military variant will be “pure Airbus Helicopters”, says Faury.

And in March 2015 comes the next stage in the airframer’s product renewal, when it officially launches its new X4, a replacement for the ageing Dauphin line, which is currently being given a sales mauling by the AgustaWestland AW139.

Crucially, however, under Faury’s tenure, the plan for the X4 has shifted markedly away from the two-step approach favoured by his predecessor, Lutz Bertling. That called for the introduction of an initial model with a regular cockpit and controls to be followed several years later with the arrival a more advanced variant featuring fly-by-wire systems and advanced cockpit displays. That plan has been revised, however. “We will make one product that is good enough from day one that addresses the market needs,” says Faury. “We do it from day one.”

Airbus Helicopters believes the EC175 will be a success despite delays during its development

Airbus Helicopters

The promised cockpit advances are the main casualty of this shift, for reasons that Faury sees as obvious: “Why delay the X4 to wait for fly-by-wire? Customers are expecting a competitive helicopter – that we can provide with the existing autopilot. We don’t need fly-by-wire.

“It increases complexity, non-recurring development costs and risks, and the value added for the customers – that’s not very clear,” he says.

However, the process of product renewal actually kicked off earlier this year with the first delivery of the revamped EC145 T2.

Handed over to German emergency medical services operator DRF Luftrettung, the 3.6t rotorcraft marks a step – but definitely not a leap – forward.

The EC145 T2, although effectively a derivative of the long-running Bk115 rotorcraft that predates even Eurocopter, is heralded by the company as “close to being an entirely new helicopter”.

Enhancements over its C2 predecessor include improved Turbomeca Arriel 2E engines, a completely new tail boom and shrouded Fenestron tail rotor – at 1.1m (3ft 7in) wide, the largest Airbus Helicopters has ever produced – along with the manufacturer’s new Helionix avionics suite, similar to that installed on the EC175.

Wolfgang Schoder, chief executive of Airbus Helicopters in Germany, says the rotorcraft has benefited from a number of manufacturing advances. He points to the three-piece carbonfibre tail boom, designed and developed at the company’s composite centre of excellence based at its Donauwörth site. The design, with the majority of the boom a monocoque structure, not only saves around 30kg (66lb) over the previous all-metal design, but is stronger too, says Schoder, because it removes the usual stress point at the boom-vertical fin junction and is more able to cope with dynamic loads.

Ramp-up at Donauwörth is steep: from 20 deliveries this year, to 50 next year, eventually taking it as high as 70. Schoder says he is “100% confident” that it can meet the production target, noting that it is already a “very mature” helicopter. A backlog of a little over 100 aircraft means “slots for the next two years are completely booked”.

It has not been a development without problems, however. First delivery was initially planned for late 2013, but delays to certification, particularly regarding the Helionix system, and a shift in corporate culture towards a more cautious approach with the arrival of Faury, pushed this back by over six months.

Schoder describes this hiatus as “frustrating, but not a drama” and stresses that customers have remained loyal.

“What we tried to do and I think we managed quite well, was to stay in touch with operators and help them keep to their targets,” says Dragos Grigorincu, EC145 T2 programme manager. However, he admits: “For sure, it was not a pleasant thing.” It was, he says, “a complex decision” to delay the programme, but declines to be drawn on whether first delivery could have taken place last year.

For its part, DRF Luftrettung remains unperturbed by the late arrival of the T2. Steffen Lutz, chief executive says the delay did not cause the Filderstadt-based firm any difficulties. “As launch customer, it would have been naive to think it would be absolutely on time. We still have enough helicopters,” he explains.

DRF Luftrettung has a framework agreement in place covering the acquisition of 20 of the rotorcraft. Five of these are firm orders in the period to 2016, and the rest will be progressively converted over the next 10-15 years, says Lutz.

The initial example – a second followed at the end of August – will operate from DRF’s Munich base performing inter-hospital patient transfers and replaces an older B2 variant. The Bavarian location was chosen, says Lutz, because that site has the most experience with the use of night-vision goggles and is also where its training captains are located.

In addition, it is sufficiently close to the Donauwörth plant should any teething troubles develop, he says.

Overall, the firm is delighted with its new rotorcraft. “We are very proud of this new helicopter and we think it is perfect to help us fulfil the rescue missions,” says Lutz, highlighting its single-engine performance and enclosed tail rotor as key attributes for DRF. The latter offers “huge security for ground personnel”, he says.

Franz Ahollinger, deputy flight operations manager at DRF, has been leading the project to integrate the new EC145 T2 into the company’s fleet. His initial experience at the controls has made him impressed with its power and capabilities. “I like the four-axis autopilot. [On an acceptance flight] we flew four IFR approaches and after configuration we just kept the hands off the controls and let it do its thing. I am already used to the three-axis [autopilot] on the C2, but this is a whole different ball game.”

Two instructors have finished conversion onto the new helicopter and the company is aiming for 20 pilots to be fully trained by the time of entry into service, expected to be in December.

The backlog also includes 15 examples of the military EC645 T2 variant on order for the German air force. The initial helicopters for this requirement are already being assembled at Donauwörth, ahead of first delivery in 2015.

And later this year comes another minor model update, with planned certification of the enhanced P3/T3 variants of the 2.9t EC135. Upgrades to the type included modified engine intakes, improved engine management software and main rotor blades that are 10cm (4in) longer than those on the current T2e/P2e models.

However, with images already circulating on the internet of what appears to be a heavily modified EC135 operating from Dönauworth – the addition of a five-blade main rotor is one major change – it is clear that the airframer is not standing still.

HERNDON, Va., Oct. 28 (UPI) -- The U.S. subsidiary of Europe's Airbus Defense and Space has installed and put into operation a TRS-3D naval radar for the U.S. Navy's Littoral Combat Ship. The radar was installed and integrated aboard the Milwaukee (LCS 5), the third Freedom variant LCS, under a contract from Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor for the vessel. Advertisement

""The TRS-3D is the choice for ships with multi-mode radar requirements, as evidenced by it being a global market leader in its class,"" said Aaron Johnson, director of Sales and Marketing, at Airbus Defense and Space Inc.'s Communications, Intelligence, Security & Electronics division. ""We're proud to support Lockheed Martin and the LCS program with our products.""

The TRS-3D is a three-dimensional, multi-mode naval radar for surveillance, self-defense, gunfire support, and helicopter control. It automatically locates and tracks both air and sea targets.

Airbus Defense and Space Inc. said eight TRS-3D radars, are now in various stages of installation aboard Freedom variant ships.

The Milwaukee is still under construction and is expected to be delivered to the U.S. Navy next year."
Airbus signs draft deal to sell 250 planes to India's IndiGo - Yahoo Singapore News,"Tue, 14 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHA6Ly9zZy5uZXdzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9haXJidXMtc2lnbnMtZHJhZnQtZGVhbC1zZWxsLTI1MC1wbGFuZXMtaW5kaWFzLTA4MzU0MDgzMS0tZmluYW5jZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European giant Airbus said Wednesday it had signed a draft deal to sell 250 of its next-generation A320neo planes to India's IndiGo, in what could be its biggest contract ever in terms of aircraft numbers. The low-cost Indian operator is already a loyal Airbus customer, having previously ordered 280 planes from the European firm, and the latest agreement is worth around $25 billion (20 billion euros) at list prices. If completed, ""the agreement will become Airbus' single largest order by number of aircraft,"" the group said in a statement. Like in many countries in Asia, India's air passenger market has expanded at breakneck speed and looks set to continue to swell as the fast-growing middle class spends its cash. Air trips per person each year in India currently stand at just 0.07, far behind developed countries such as the United States with 2.49 air trips annually. Airbus, its arch-rival Boeing and Brazil's Embraer -- in their 20-year forecasts for the industry -- have all said the Asia Pacific regions as a whole is the key market to enter because of the burgeoning middle class. And international tourism in the region is also booming -- visitor arrivals from abroad grew 6.0 percent to 248 million last year, the strongest of any region worldwide, according to the UN World Tourism Organisation. IndiGo, India's largest passenger carrier, is the sole airline among the four biggest currently operating in the country to report profits consistently. ""This new order reaffirms IndiGo's commitment to the long-term development of affordable air transportation in India and overseas,"" airline president Aditya Ghosh said in a statement. Smaller passenger planes are increasingly in demand around Asia as budget carriers expand their reach to less prominent cities. And unlike its traditional A320 plane, the ""neo"" aircraft is designed to consume 15 percent less fuel, a significant selling point for airlines in the cut-throat medium-haul sector. It boasts aerodynamic improvements including little curved winglets, trimmed weight and more efficient engines. Airbus says its current version of the A320 family, which also includes the smaller A319 and bigger A321, has 60 percent of the global medium-haul market, ahead of US rival Boeing with its 737 aircraft. ""The A320neo continues to dominate world market share and this commitment confirms the A320 family as the aircraft of choice in the most dynamic aviation growth markets,"" Fabrice Bregier, Airbus chief executive, said in the statement. The European firm says that to date, it has almost 11,000 orders of A320 family planes and over 6,200 aircraft have been delivered to 400 customers and operators worldwide. However Airbus is trailing Boeing this year, having taken in just 791 net orders for aircraft in the first nine months of the year, compared to 1,000 for its US mega-rival, although if finalised this year the IndiGo deal could push it into the lead."

BAE Systems Image

The Australian Defence Forces recently concluded a highly successful trial of BAE Systems’ Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) laser-guided rocket for use on its Army and Navy helicopters. The ground trial marks the first time the APKWS technology, which transforms a standard unguided 2.75-inch (70-millimeter) rocket into a precision laser-guided weapon, has been demonstrated on a Forges de Zeebrugge (FZ) rocket.

“Through its long track record of success with the U.S. military, the APKWS technology has always been used with a Hydra rocket,” said David Harrold, director of precision guidance solutions at BAE Systems. “This demonstration highlights the unique mid-body design and versatility of the APKWS technology by showcasing the ease of deployment on the FZ rocket and its native launcher.”

During the ground-based live fire event in August, held at the Woomera Prohibited Area test range in South Australia, the APKWS laser-guided technology was on target with all seven shots fired while integrated with the FZ90 rocket motor and warhead. There was no modification required to the guidance kit to integrate with the FZ rocket. Based on the successful test, the Australian Army intends to conduct a live fire flight trial in November that could lead to the APKWS rocket fielding on the Army’s Airbus Tiger Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter and Navy’s MH-60R Seahawk platforms beginning in 2015.

Conducted by the Australian Aerospace Operational Support Group, the trial was designed to qualify the APKWS rocket for use by the Australian military to bridge the current capability gap between unguided small-diameter rockets and larger-diameter anti-armor munitions. Unlike other available offerings, the flexibility of the APKWS technology allowed the Australian Defence Force to move from concept to live fire trial in a matter of months while using its current rocket inventory and equipment.

“The APKWS laser-guided rocket is an easy-to-use, cost-effective, and flexible system,” said Maj. David Paterson, Rotary Wing Flight Commander of the Australian Army’s Aircraft Stores Compatibility Engineering Squadron. “Delivering this capability to our troops while leveraging existing equipment is a significant accomplishment that will greatly expand and enhance our military helicopters’ mission success.”"

The proposed system would mimic bird noises and can be set up on the ground at an airport or its equipment can be fitted to front of an aircraft.

It’s the latest example of the lengths that manufacturers, airlines and airports are reaching as bird strikes cost the world’s aviation industry nearly £1bn a year as a result of damage, delays for travellers or missed flight connections.

The European Aviation Safety Agency says bird strikes cost the industry nearly £1bn a year

Patent: Airbus has patented a system that mimics the sounds of birds in an attempt to prevent bird strikes

Nearly 2,500 bird strikes were reported in the UK last year with an average of around six a day, according to the Civil Aviation Authority.

A Federal Aviation Administration study suggests there are an average of nine bird strikes a day involving civil aircraft in the US alone.

To repel birds, Airbus’ system mimics warning signals from birds of prey, natural distress calls from specific flocks, and the flapping of wings.

The ‘acoustic scaring device’ would be located on a plane’s nose landing gear, according to a rough sketch submitted with the patent application.

A study by a London consulting firm suggests each bird strike costs an average of £41,000

Airbus patented the system as it expects a ‘considerable increase’ in the number of bird strikes due to a risk in air traffic in South America, Asia and Africa, and that potentially means more delays for passengers.

But the manufacturer admits it may not have found the perfect solution because some bird species may become accustomed to the noise or it may have no effect at all.

Last week, discount airline Fastjet announced that bird strikes had wreaked havoc on its operations.

With four incidents in two weeks, the Gatwick-based airline had to delay or cancel flights because it had no replacement aircraft available.

Miracle on the Hudson: There was no loss of life after a US Airways flight ditched into New York's Hudson River

Manufacturers, airlines and airports have been paying greater attention to the problem since arguably the most famous bird strike of all time.

Known as the Miracle on the Hudson, a US Airways Airbus A320 was forced to ditch into the Hudson River in New York after hitting a flock of Canada geese on 29 January 2009.

The incident was dubbed a ‘miracle’ because no one died.

The largest loss of life resulting from a bird strike occurred in 1960, when an Eastern Air Lines flight struck a flock of European starlings during take-off.

A sign at Manchester Airport warns people not to feed birds as a crow is perched behind the security fence

All four engines were damaged and the plane crashed in the Boston, Massachusetts, harbour, killing 62 people.

Since 1912, there have been nearly 250 fatalities arising from bird strikes, according to the European Aviation Safety Agency.

A study conducted by London consulting firm Insight SRI found that bird strikes occur 2.1 times per 10,000 aircraft movements, and roughly two-thirds cause no damage."

Airbus Helicopters has delivered a twin-engine EC135 P2e to the 999 Emergency Rescue Center (999 Center), a subsidiary of the Red Cross Foundation in Beijing. The operator is the first to field an EC135 specifically equipped for helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) in China.

The helicopter will assist the 999 Center’s call center, ambulances and hospital network to provide emergency service across a 500-km radius around Beijing, including the city of Tianjin and Hebei Province. It comes equipped with a HEMS kit from Bucher, including two stretchers, three medical seats, three oxygen bottles, one monitor and a defibrillator. Other specialized medical equipment includes a Perfusor infusion system, retainer, suction pump and respirator. The configuration of the EC135 is very close to the ADAC HEMS standard, according to an Airbus Helicopters spokesperson.

The entry-into-service of the first HEMS-configured EC135 represents “a very important step for Airbus Helicopters in China,” the spokesperson said. “In mature markets such as Europe and the United States, there’s an average of one to two EMS helicopters per 1 million inhabitants. Hence China would need about 1,500 to 3,000 EMS helicopters.”

Airbus Helicopters anticipates demand for around 200 helicopters from the Chinese HEMS sector over the next 10 to 15 years, aiming to capture up to 80 percent of the market. The company projects that China will generate the largest demand for helicopters over the next 20 years, with a total volume of 3,000 to 5,000 helicopters at a value of €50 billion ($63.3 billion) serving various roles, including for civil and parapublic services such as HEMS, search-and-rescue, utility work, power line operations and agricultural spraying.

With assistance from the central Chinese government and the Air Force, Beijing Red Cross Emergency Center has received approval for 83 temporary landing sites in China. Once the government relaxes airspace regulations over China, Airbus Helicopters estimates a market for up to 1,000 total aircraft over the next decade. The manufacturer cited an example of the market potential for the EC175 medium utility variant, which could reach up to 600 units over the next 20 years, worth €7.5 billion (around $9.5 billion).

ADAC HEMS Academy near Cologne, Germany, is conducting training for the 999 Center’s EC135 medical personnel, including instruction about how to manage treatment of the patient in the helicopter, crew resource management (CRM) and familiarization courses in the Bucher equipment. Airbus Helicopters China is also supplying training to include workshops and outreach efforts. Maintenance is carried out through Beijing 999 Center’s flight and maintenance subsidiaries and third-party providers, while Airbus Helicopters China is responsible for OEM service and support, including warranty management, spares delivery and technical assistance.

Airbus Helicopters plans to deliver a second EC135 P2e in first quarter 2015, while 999 Center has signed a letter of intent for a pair of EC145 T2s."

The first component of Europe's space data highway passed several critical tests this summer replicating the harsh launch and space conditions it will soon have to endure.

The European Data Relay System, or EDRS, will consist of two geostationary nodes collecting data from low-orbiting satellites via laser and radio links for retransmission down to Earth.

Complementing current routes, it will ensure the near-realtime availability of information for time-critical events such as environmental monitoring, emergency response and security missions.

In addition to the sophistication of the technology, the payloads must also be robust enough to withstand the rigours of launch and life in space.

This first element, EDRS-A, consists of three hosted packages on the Eutelsat-9B satellite for launch next year.

The first is a laser terminal capable of receiving 1.8 Gbit/s of user data from a satellite up to 45 000 km away.

EDRS-A also carries a radio terminal that will handle up to 300 Mbit/s – a vast improvement over today's systems.

The third package is an 'opportunity payload' funded by Italy's ASI space agency operating independently of EDRS to provide broadcasting services over Italy.

The testing took place at the Toulouse, France facilities of Airbus Defence and Space, the Eutelsat-9B prime contractor.

After its two main modules were mated, the satellite and its hosted payloads passed the month-long thermal vacuum test in July.

The vibration test then subjected them to the rigours of launch, followed by a stint in the acoustic test chamber. They emerged unscathed from them all.

Germany's TESAT Spacecom is the prime contractor for the EDRS payloads and also provided the laser terminals on the four low-orbiting Sentinel-1 and -2 Earth observation satellites. Part of Europe's Copernicus programme, these satellites will reduce the time delays in transferring their data to the ground through the greater flexibility of this new service.

The satellite and EDRS payloads now face their final radio-frequency tests. Then the solar wings and antennas will be added ready for launch preparations to begin.

The EDRS SpaceDataHighway is a commercially operated data relay system created as a public–private partnership between ESA and Airbus DS. As prime contractor, the company will build, operate and co-fund the infrastructure, as well as providing the data transmission services to ESA and customers worldwide.

ESA is carrying out the project on behalf of its Member States as part of its Advanced Research in Telecommunications Systems programme."

A British Airways Airbus A380 returned to Earth with a whoomp last week at Washington Dulles International Airport.Self-described “plane nuts” applauded from a nearby taxiway, getting special airport clearance to be so close as the A380 thundered by. The super jumbo, the world’s largest, can carry as many as 525 passengers across multiple classes.

British Airways is adding the A380 to its Dulles-to-London (Heathrow) route, flying daily. Air France opened Dulles to A380 service in 2011, flying to Paris.

Airbus built the big plane believing airlines would move more passengers through airports crunched for landing slots, like Heathrow. Or just to move more people. Emirates has 53 of the A380s flying (with 87 more coming).

The A380 is so massive that airports have to ensure that runway concrete won’t crumble from the weight, and its wheels won’t roll into grass from too-tight turns. It takes two loading bridges for the upper and lower decks. At the gate area, an A380 seating chart accompanied by signs tells passengers where to line up by row."

Airbus to upgrade India aircraft sales forecast | Mint - Mint,"Fri, 17 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9Db21wYW5pZXMvM2kwb0RiSk1abWs4NDd2bmtyYjZDSS9BaXJidXMtdG8tdXBncmFkZS1JbmRpYS1haXJjcmFmdC1zYWxlcy1mb3JlY2FzdC5odG1s0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGl2ZW1pbnQuY29tL0NvbXBhbmllcy8zaTBvRGJKTVptazg0N3Zua3JiNkNJL0FpcmJ1cy10by11cGdyYWRlLUluZGlhLWFpcmNyYWZ0LXNhbGVzLWZvcmVjYXN0Lmh0bWw_ZmFjZXQ9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European plane maker Airbus Group NV will soon raise its forecast for the number of aircraft it expects India’s airlines to purchase in the two decades to 2032, reflecting its optimism about the country’s economic prospects.

In March, Airbus forecast that India would require 1,290 new aircraft valued at $190 billion in 2012-32 to meet travel demand in the country.

“What we now see is with this new Indian government in place, we are a lot more optimistic about India and its economic growth in the years ahead,"" Kiran Rao, Airbus’ executive vice-president of strategy and marketing, said in an interview from Singapore, “We will revise the India forecast soon.""

On Wednesday, IndiGo, India’s largest domestic airline by market share, announced that it had signed an agreement to buy 250 aircraft from Toulouse, France-based Airbus—a deal valued at $25.5 billion at list prices.

Optimism about India’s growth prospects has increased since the Bharatiya Janata Party came to power by winning the April-May general election with a majority on its own, promising a revival of the economy that grew by less than 5% in each of the past two years.

High operating costs and intense competition have hurt India’s airlines, which have lost a combined $10.6 billion in the past seven years, according to the consulting firm Capa Centre for Aviation. These years saw the grounding of Kingfisher Airlines Ltd, Air Deccan (bought by Kingfisher), MDLR Airlines, Paramount Airways and Indus Air.

After posting a combined loss of about $1.7 billion in 2013-14, Indian airlines may lose in the range of $1.3-1.4 billion in the current financial year, Capa has forecast.

But India remains an attractive market for plane makers like Airbus and its US rival Boeing Co., which see vast room for growth in Asia’s third-largest economy. Indian airlines fly a total of about 450 aircraft.

“India is one of the fastest growing aviation markets and will record the fastest growing domestic flows to become one of the world’s top 10 markets by 2033,"" an Airbus spokesman said. “Today one in 20 people in India travel and in 20 years this will increase four-fold.""

Part of the fleet growth will be driven by new airlines, including Tata Sons Ltd’s joint venture with Singapore Airlines Ltd that will compete with IndiGo, Jet Airways (India) Ltd, Air India Ltd, SpiceJet Ltd, GoAir, Air Costa and AirAsia India in the domestic market.

The aviation ministry has also issued licenses to several new airlines including Air One Aviation Pvt. Ltd, Zexus Air and Premier Air, Turbo Megha, Air Carnival, Air Pegasus and Zav Airways.

The International Air Transport Association (Iata), the biggest airline grouping, said on Thursday that India will overtake the UK in the number of air travellers in the next 20 years.

“Currently the ninth-largest market, India will see a total of 367 million passengers by 2034, an extra 266 million annual passengers compared to today. It will overtake the United Kingdom (148 million extra passengers, total market 337 million) to become the third-largest market around 2031,"" Iata said in its 20-year outlook.

India will then be only behind China and the US.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on 7 October raised its medium-term assessment of the Indian economy, ignoring the setback of a deficient monsoon and arguing that the political stability arising from having a party with a clear majority in Parliament in charge will provide a launch pad for long-overdue structural reforms.

IMF, in its biannual World Economic Outlook, raised its growth projection for India to 5.6% for 2014-15 from 5.4% projected a little over six months ago.

“Indian aviation needs a transparent policy and regulatory regime which is totally aligned to India’s national interests and there are expectations from this government that it will deliver and structurally change the India aviation Industry,"" Capa South Asia chief executive Kapil Kaul said.

"Airbus Group NV share price up, announces cut of A330 production in 2015 - TradingPedia","Fri, 17 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYWRpbmdwZWRpYS5jb20vMjAxNC8xMC8xNy9haXJidXMtZ3JvdXAtbnYtc2hhcmUtcHJpY2UtdXAtYW5ub3VuY2VzLWN1dC1vZi1hMzMwLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24taW4tMjAxNS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Group NV said it will cut production of its A330 twin-engine jet in 2015 in an indication that demand for the long-range plane is insufficient to sustain its current construction rate.

On Friday the Toulouse-based company said it will reduce the build-rate of its A330 model to nine per month in the fourth quarter of 2015. Currently, Airbus is constructing 10 A330s each month, a company record. The aircrafts sales surpassed the European plane makers own forecast and is a key income provider.

Airbus began taking orders for its new A330neo, an updated version of the A330, with the core difference between the two being the new engines. The company has already booked commitments for more than 120 units of the model. Due to the high number of orders, Airbus scrapped plans to build the A350-800 model, a shorter version of its all-new A350 wide-body jetliner. Deliveries of the A330neo are expected to start from 2017.

Sanford Bernstein analysts said that production of the 20-year-old plane may be cut even more, down to six per month in 2017, as they forecast orders to decrease sharply in 2016. They do not expect sales to bounce back once the company transitions to the A330neo.

Rivalry between Airbus and Boeing Co. continues as the companies introduced plans to build more aircraft. The French company has been signaling a possible increase of production of its single-aisle A320 series, while its U.S. counterpart said it will boost construction of its 737 models by 10, from 42 to 52 a month.

The two companies are switching to new and more efficient engines for their updated models to help airlines cut fuel costs. Currently Rolls-Royce, General Electric and Pratt & Whitney all offer engines for the A330. However, the only supplier for the A330s upgraded version will be Rolls-Royce.

“Our role as an aircraft manufacturer is to anticipate and adapt our output to ensure we continue to maintain a smooth production flow for Airbus and for our supply chain,” Airbus executive vice president for programs Tom Williams said in a statement.

Airbus Group NV lost 2.17% on Thursday and closed at €42.75 in Paris. On Friday the stock gained 0.37% by 12:40 GMT to trade at €42.91, marking an 11.46% one-year decrease. The company is valued at €33.55 billion. According to the Financial Times, the 25 analysts offering 12-month price targets for Airbus Group NV have a median target of €58.00, with a high estimate of €70.00 and a low estimate of €34.00. The median estimate represents a 35.67% increase from the last close price of €42.75."

Vanity Fair magazine — cobbling cockpit audio recordings, flight-data records and investigator interviews — painted the final, frantic moments of Flight 447, which took off from Rio de Janeiro on May 31, 2009, and nose-dived into the ocean long before reaching Paris.

All 228 on board were killed.

A combination of bad weather, pilot error and the captain’s extra-marital affair contributed to the deadliest crash in Air France history, according to VF.

Junior co-pilot Pierre-Cedric Bonin, 32, was at the helm of the Airbus A330 as it hit a thunderstorm over the sea.

Bonin and fellow co-pilot David Robert, 37, pitched their craft sharply up instead of down, leading the plane to stall and come crashing down.

Marc Dubois, the 58-year-old captain, had left the cockpit to take a nap because he had been up all night with his mistress, and returned when it was too late to avoid catastrophe.

As the plane was falling fast at just 4,000 feet above the ocean, a panicked Robert couldn’t believe what was happening.

“F–k, we’re going to crash! It’s not true! But what’s happening?” the terrified co-pilot said.

A moment later, either Bonin or Robert knew his fate had been sealed and shouted, “F–k — we’re dead!”

The plane sank to the ocean floor and wasn’t found for nearly two years.

Dubois and the rest of his crew had arrived in Rio three days before Flight 447’s departure.

The married captain was accompanied by gal pal Veronique Gaignard, an off-duty flight attendant and budding opera singer.

Dubois’ extramarital love life was not part of the official report, but it’s not disputed that the captain got just one hour of sleep the night before getting into Flight 447’s cockpit.

Not long before 447 ran into the storm that spelled their doom, Dubois left the cockpit for a nap, leaving inexperienced Bonin in charge.

Dubois had more than 11,000 flight hours compared to Bonin, who had logged a little less than 3,000. Robert had double the hours of Bonin, according to VF.

The probe’s lead French investigator believes that Dubois would have properly navigated the storm, had he not been napping.

“If the captain had stayed in position . . . it would have delayed his sleep by no more than 15 minutes, and because of his experience, maybe the story would have ended differently,” chief French investigator Alain Bouillard told VF."

Bangkok to Doha services

These flights are also showing for redemption too for those who want to redeem 80,000 Avios and £224 in taxes:

Qatar Airways will be operating a total four sets of A380 flights when this rotation commences. These include:

2 x A380s between Doha and London Heathrow

1 x A380 between Doha and Paris Charles De Gaulle

1 x A380 between Doha and Bangkok

Whilst Qatar Airways fleet is much smaller than the Emirates mega-fleet of A380s, Qatar Airways are targeting the use of their aircraft on high yield, low slot availability routes. Hopefully this strategy will work out for them.

Tripoli, 29 October 2014:

Buraq Air, much of whose fleet was damaged in fighting at Tripoli airport, is hiring an . . .[restrict]Airbus A320 from a Kyrgyz carrier which is banned from operating in European airspace.

The aircraft is being leased from S Group International, which was set up in the Kyrgyz Republic in 2013.

Buraq has until now operated mainly Boeing 737s and Ilyushins. Four of its Boeings were damaged during the July battles around Tripoli International Airport. One Boeing was burnt out completely but the airline managed to fly another with shrapnel and bullet damage to Malta for repairs.

Details of the hire from S Group International are not available. However, given that Buraq pilots are unlikely to be type-cleared on the Airbus, the aircraft, registration number EX-32004, has probably come with its own flight crew as part of a “wet lease”.

The EU flying ban on the two aircraft operated by S Group International will not affect Buraq which does not operate to Europe. Along with Libya Airlines and Afriqiyah it is party to a voluntary agreement to keep out of EU skies until the Libyan Civil Aviation Authority is deemed to have improved its performance including certification and inspection procedures of flight crews and engineers.

The Royal Thai Navy signed for five EC645 T2s to be deployed on transport duties and other missions, with deliveries scheduled to begin in 2016. Its purchase represents the first export order of this militarized version of the EC145 T2, which is the newest and most powerful model in Airbus Helicopters’ proven EC145 light twin-engine helicopter family.

In the Royal Thai Air Force’s reorder of Airbus Helicopters’ EC725, the military service is obtaining two of the tactical transport rotorcraft for SAR/CSAR (search and rescue/combat search and rescue) missions, operating from Wing 2 at Lop Buri Air Base in Thailand’s Lop Buri Province. These aircraft will be provided in 2017, joining the four previously-ordered EC725s booked in 2012 for deliveries from 2015.

“By acquiring both the EC645 T2 and EC725, Thailand will be operating two of the most capable helicopters in their categories, delivering high levels of mission flexibility with their modern avionics and rugged airframes,” said Philippe Monteux, Airbus Helicopters’ Head of Region South East Asia & Pacific.

The EC645 T2 features a modern digital cockpit and a 4-axis autopilot. With a maximum take-off weight of 3.7 tons, the helicopter is powered by Turbomeca Arriel 2E powerplants equipped with dual-channel full authority digital engine controls (FADEC). Operational safety is enhanced by Airbus Helicopters’ Fenestron shrouded tail rotor, particularly for landings and takeoffs in confined landing sites, as well as during loading/unloading on the ground while the rotor is turning.

The EC725 is a highly capable twin-engine helicopter with a digital 4-axis autopilot and five-blade composite main rotor. It can perform multiple missions that range from combat search and rescue, long-range tactical transport and aeromedical transport to logistic support and naval duties.

Currently operated by the military forces of France, Brazil, Mexico, Malaysia, Thailand and soon in Indonesia as well, the EC725’s reliability and durability has been confirmed in such crisis areas as Lebanon, Afghanistan and Mali, while also supporting French troops during NATO-led operations in Libya."

The requirement calls for the replacement of the Royal Australian Navy’s and the Australian Army’s current training rotorcraft with 15 new Airbus Helicopters EC135s, plus three full motion simulators and other synthetic training devices.

Eric Raz/Airbus Helicopters

Made on 23 October, the announcement followed 10 months of contract negotiations following the team’s selection as the preferred tenderer last December. A contract signature is expected by the end of October.

The navy's current training fleet comprises 15 Airbus Helicopters AS350BA Squirrels with 723 Sqn at Naval Air Station Nowra in New South Wales, which entered service in 1984. The army has about 30 Bell Helicopter 206B-1 Kiowas (below), which have been in use since the early 1970s, based at Holsworthy Barracks near Sydney with 173 Aviation Squadron, and with the Army Aviation Training Centre at Oakey, west of Brisbane.

The new aircraft and training facilities for both services will based at Nowra, with the system expected to commence training in late 2016.

“This will deliver a fully-integrated modern training environment with both inflight and virtual environments on contemporary twin-engine helicopters and flight simulators,” Johnston says. Crews will transition from the EC135 to the Airbus Helicopters Tiger, Boeing CH-47F, Lockheed Martin/Sikorsky MH‑60R and NH Industries MRH90, he notes.

The Boeing/Thales team for HATS was selected ahead of a direct bid by Australian Aerospace (now part of Airbus Group Australia Pacific) with the EC135, and a teaming of Raytheon Australia and Bell, which offered the Bell 429.

Airbus A350 cleared to fly record distance on one engine - Times of Malta,"Wed, 15 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzb2ZtYWx0YS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9haXJidXMtYTM1MC1jbGVhcmVkLXRvLWZseS1yZWNvcmQtZGlzdGFuY2Utb24tb25lLWVuZ2luZS41Mzk4NTnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has won permission for its twin-engined A350 to fly more than six hours on one engine in the event of a breakdown, a key approval that allows its new long-haul jet to fly almost any passenger route.

The European Aviation Safety Agency granted the Airbus jet Extended Operations, known as ETOPS, of ""beyond 180 minutes"", but will allow pilots to fly the A350 for up to 370 minutes if one engine shuts down, Airbus said.

ETOPS rules determine the maximum flying time on one engine that jets can stray from the nearest airport at any point during their journey -- so they can make it back safely in the event the other engine fails.

That ceiling determines the routes that modern twin-engined jets can take over deserted areas and oceans and is therefore seen as crucial to the sales pitches for such aircraft.

The maximum A350 diversion time of six hours and 10 minutes is equivalent to a maximum diversion distance of 2,500 nautical miles (4,630 km), an industry record, Airbus said.

Boeing's 787 Dreamliner has clearance to operate for 330 minutes on one engine, but the difference between the two categories is widely viewed as a marketing one since both jets will have enough margin to operate on most commercial routes.

The ETOPS rules are subject to separate clearances that must be sought by each airline.

Engine and aircraft makers say in-flight engine shutdowns are extremely rare and that jets seldom have to divert over such large distances. But manufacturers must demonstrate an aircraft can fly long diversions and airlines must prove they have the training in place to prepare for this.

Aircraft descend to a lower altitude and fly at slower speeds when forced to divert by the loss of one engine.

Reuters reported on Sept 30 that European regulators, having granted the main airworthiness or 'type certificate' approval for Airbus's new long-haul jet, were looking separately at granting it an ETOPS margin of 370 minutes.

It is the first time a wide-body jet has been granted such autonomy before entering service, but questions remain over whether and when the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration will issue similar flexibility for airlines under its jurisdiction.

The FAA said last week it would grant its own safety certification for the A350 by the end of October.

""We can't speculate on what ETOPS rating the A350 may receive because we haven’t yet awarded the type certificate,"" a spokesman for the agency said later, asked about its stance towards extended operations for the jet.

The Airbus A350 is due to enter service by the end of the year."

IndiGo places single largest order of 250 Airbus A-320neos

Private airline IndiGo Wednesday announced signing a deal for 250 Airbus A-320neo aircraft - making it Airbus' single largest order by number of aircraft

Mumbai, Oct 15: Private airline IndiGo Wednesday announced signing a deal for 250 Airbus A-320neo aircraft – making it Airbus’ single largest order by number of aircraft. The Memorandum of Understanding for Airbus’ leading single aisle aircraft family was signed by its co-founders Rakesh Gangwal and Rahul Bhatia, group managing director of InterGlobe.

IndiGo President Aditya Ghosh said that the new aircraft would enable the airline to continue bringing its low fares and hassle-free service to more customers and markets, besides creating more jobs and growth. “This new order reaffirms IndiGo’s commitment to the long term development of affordable air transportation in India and overseas,” Ghosh noted.

Earlier, IndiGo had placed orders for 280 Airbus aircraft – 100 A-320neo and 180 A-320 neo. “The A-320neo continues to dominate world market share and this commitment confirms it as the aircraft of choice in the most dynamic aviation growth markets,” said Airbus President and CEO Fabrice Bregier.

The A-320neo ‘new engine option’ incorporates many innovations, including latest generation engines and large sharklet wing-tip devices, which together deliver 15 percent in fuel savings from day one and 20 per cent by 2020 which is equivalent to a reduction of 5,000 tonnes of CO2 per aircraft per year.

The A-320 family is the world’s best-selling single aisle product line with almost 11,000 orders till date and over 6,200 aircraft delivered globally to 400 customers and operators. It has a wide cabin and offers the industry’s best level of comfort in all classes and Airbus’ 18-inch wide seats in economy class as a standard.

Founded in 2006, the Gurgaon-based low-cost airline commands the largest market share of over 32 percent with over 530 daily flights

They are mainly due to be deployed at Lufthansa and at the Lufthansa Group carrier Swiss International Air Lines.

Lufthansa is due to take delivery of the first A320neos in 2016."
Airbus turns the A330 into a luxe VIP jet - Executive Traveller,"Tue, 21 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWJpbGxpb25haXJlcy13YW50LXByaXZhdGUtamV0cy10by1iZS1iaWdnZXItb24tdGhlLWluc2lkZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"There's no pleasing some people. It's not enough that billionaires can fly in private jets – now they want those VIP jets to be bigger on the inside, according to Airbus.

Exhibit A: the Airbus ACJ330 Summit business jet, which turns a regular A330-200 into something a little more exclusive, with a bedroom and ensuite bathroom at the front for the Chosen One.

That's followed by an office, a conference and dining room and a working area, and then airline-style first-class and economy seating at the rear.

Joining the ACJ330 is the ACJ319 Elegance at a starting price of US$80 million, which the aircraft maker says boasts ""the widest and tallest cabin of any (single-aisle) business jet."""

A terrifying roller coaster ride in the sky turned Fuzzy Maiava's life upside down. Six years later, the ride goes on.

The North Shore grandfather is one of two Kiwis taking a class action lawsuit against Airbus and aviation technology giant Northrop Grumman after a Perth-bound Qantas A330 nosedived twice over the Indian Ocean in 2008.

Maiava, a flight attendant, was flung into the ceiling and wants $6.2 million for injuries and psychological harm that have left him unable to work and in chronic pain.

Maiava and fellow Kiwi flight attendant Jenaya McKay's case took its own nosedive this month when a US judge ruled our ACC scheme prevented Kiwis from suing. Many of the 315 people on board have settled after Airbus and Northrop Grumman chose not to contest liability.

Maiava's US-based aviation lawyer Floyd Wisner said an appeal was planned after the October 9 ruling.

Maiava has received just over $200,000 from ACC since the incident.

Neither Airbus nor Northrop Grumman would comment, but ACC Minister Nikki Kaye said the law did not stop Kiwis taking legal action overseas.

As for Maiava, his disappointment over the decision was lifted by the birth last week of a grandson."
