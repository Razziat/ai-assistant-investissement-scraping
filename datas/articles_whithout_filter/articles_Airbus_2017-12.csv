Deal valued at nearly $50 billion, at list prices

Airbus announced today that it had finalized agreements with Indigo Partners and its four portfolio airlines for the purchase of 430 additional A320neo Family aircraft for ultra-low-cost airlines Frontier Airlines (United States), JetSMART (Chile), Volaris (Mexico) and Wizz Air (Hungary). The signed purchase agreement follows a Memorandum of Understanding among the parties announced at the Dubai Air Show last month.



The 430-aircraft order is made up of 274 A320neos and 156 A321neos worth $49.5 billion at list prices. Airlines in the Indigo Partners family had previously placed orders for a total of 427 A320 Family aircraft.

“These customer-friendly and efficient A320neo Family aircraft form a great platform for continued growth for our family of ultra-low-cost airlines,” said Bill Franke, Managing Partner of Indigo Partners. “The Indigo Partners team looks forward to creating even more value for even more passengers around the world with these modern and efficient aircraft.”

John Leahy, Airbus’ Chief Operating Officer, Customers, added, “Bill Franke and the teams from Wizz, Volaris, JetSMART and Frontier are great partners, and the global Airbus team is very proud to continue to meet their growing needs for aircraft that provide value, reliability and comfort. The A320neo Family offers the lowest operating costs, longest range and most spacious cabin in the single-aisle aircraft market, making the ‘NEO’ a great choice for these low-cost airlines in the Americas and Europe.”

The aircraft ordered today are a mix of A320neos and A321neos and will be delivered to the individual airlines as follows:

Wizz - 72 A320neo, 74 A321neo

Frontier - 100 A320neo, 34 A321neo

JetSMART - 56 A320neo, 14 A321neo

Volaris - 46 A320neo, 34 A321neo

Indigo Partners’ Franke indicated that engine selections will be made at a later date.

The A320neo Family incorporates the very latest technologies, including new generation engines and Sharklet wing-tip devices, which together will deliver 20 percent fuel savings by 2020. With more than 5,800 orders received from 98 customers since its launch in 2010, the A320neo Family has captured some 60 percent market share.

Delta picks Airbus over Boeing for huge 100-jet order - USA TODAY,"Thu, 14 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdHJhdmVsL2ZsaWdodHMvdG9kYXlpbnRoZXNreS8yMDE3LzEyLzE0L2RlbHRhLXBpY2tzLWFpcmJ1cy1vdmVyLWJvZWluZy1odWdlLTEwMC1qZXQtb3JkZXIvOTUxMjY1MDAxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Delta picks Airbus over Boeing for huge 100-jet order

Show Caption Hide Caption Delta to order 100 Airbus jets Delta Air Lines said it will order 100 Airbus A321neo jets in a blow to rival plane-maker Boeing. Roselle Chen reports. Video provided by Reuters Newslook

Delta Air Lines announced an order for 100 Airbus A321neo jets that the carrier says will help it refresh its fleet. The order also is a setback for Boeing, after reports that Delta also had been considering the U.S. jetmaker’s 737 Max 10 model.

Delta announced the Airbus deal Thursday, placing a firm order for 100 A321neos with an option for 100 more. Delta says the new planes, which will be powered by Pratt & Whitney engines, will begin arriving to the airline in 2020 with deliveries continuing through 2023. The deal would be worth up to $12.7 billion at list prices, though carriers typically receive significant discounts in negotiating such orders.

“This is the right transaction at the right time for our customers, our employees and our shareholders,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a statement. “Delta, Airbus and Pratt & Whitney share the same commitment to safety, efficiency, innovation and continuously improving the customer experience.”

Delta will configure its A321neos with 197 seats. The layout will include 20 first-class seats and 30 extra-legroom coach seats, which the airline brands as “Delta Comfort+.” The remaining 147 seats will be standard coach seats.

Passengers flying on the new jets will have access to on-demand in-flight entertainment and satellite-based 2Ku in-flight Wi-Fi. Power ports will be available at every seat and Delta says the cabins on the A321neos will feature “expansive, 25% -larger bookshelf-style overhead bins and full spectrum LED cabin lighting.”

For Airbus, the order from a U.S. airline is a victory in its ongoing marketshare battle with Boeing. Reports earlier this week -- including from CNN and Bloomberg -- said Delta also had been considering Boeing's 737 Max 10 jets for the order. Instead, the order went to Airbus.

“This purchase furthers our commitment to U.S. aviation – a commitment that has never been stronger,” John Leahy, Airbus’ Chief Operating Officer for its commercial aircraft division, said in a statement. “Today, there is more U.S. content in Airbus aircraft than from any other country, with more than 40% of our aircraft-related procurement coming from the United States.”

Leahy added that “many"" of the A321neos ordered by Delta will be assembled at Airbus' factory in Mobile, Ala.

The Airbus-Delta deal also comes amid what are thought to be frayed relations between Delta and Boeing.

Delta has been caught up in a trade spat that began when Boeing lodged a formal trade complaint with the U.S. Commerce Department in April. In that complaint, Boeing alleged Canadian jetmaker Bombardier received unfair state subsidies and then sold its new C Series model below cost in the U.S.

The U.S. Commerce Department eventually responded to the complaint by announcing preliminary duties of 80% and 220% on the C Series planes, a move that would negatively affect Delta’s order.

Since then, Delta’s CEO has defiantly said his carrier would not pay any tariffs on the jet and has added that he doesn’t believe Boeing has a legitimate complaint.

The Quebec-based jetmaker's new C Series jet had been struggling until Delta Air Lines inked a firm order in 2016 for 75 of the aircraft. The deal pumped new life into the C Series line, which faced weak sales and a bleak future before Delta’s order.

Still, Bombardier may get in the last barb in its battle against Boeing. Shortly after the U.S. Commerce Department announced its preliminary duties, Bombardier shocked the industry by announcing that it had sold a controlling C Series stake to Airbus. As part of the deal, Airbus would assemble C Series jets sold to U.S. airlines at its North American factory in Alabama.

Airbus also would provide procurement, sales and marketing support for the planes, which will seat 100 to 150 passengers, in exchange for 50.01% of the program.

For its part, Boeing said 2017 had been a strong year for the jetmaker, no matter Delta's latest order.

""We’re pleased with the significant amount of order wins at Boeing this year,"" the company said in a statement to USA TODAY's Today in the Sky blog. ""And we competed with a strong but disciplined offer in the Delta campaign. While Delta has chosen to go with Airbus and Bombardier in recent single aisle campaigns, we are proud of the 737 MAX family’s superior value and performance.""

Boeing also seemed happy to downplay any perceived hard feelings that might exist between it and Delta.

""Delta remains a valued customer, and we’ll continue exploring ways to best meet their needs in the future,"" Boeing added in its statement. ""Globally, we have 367 orders and commitments from 16 customers for the 737 MAX 10 -- an airplane that delivers unmatched operating economics and fuel efficiency. We’ll keep making that case with our customers here and around the world.""

Analysis

Dec. 15, 2017, © Leeham Co.: Was the choice by Delta Air Lines the big “blow” to Boeing many in the media are making it out to be?

It was a PR blow, yes. Even this was limited to those in the know.

But it wasn’t a material blow by any stretch.

Here’s why the hand-wringers are wrong.

PR Blow

Sure, Boeing sorely wanted to win this deal. But relations between Delta and Boeing have been bad for years, so this was a bad place to start from. The Boeing-Bombardier trade complaint, attacking the C Series order by Delta, didn’t help. These factors alone made Boeing’s chances an uphill battle.

Boeing pit the 737-10 MAX against the A321neo. As I noted previously, the MAX 10 put Boeing in the game. Pitching the MAX 9 against the A321neo clearly wouldn’t have worked. The MAX 9 carries fewer passengers, its airport performance is inferior and it has less range.

The MAX 10 carriers about the same number of passengers as the A321neo. So, winning comes down to commercial terms.

More than price

“We competed with a strong but disciplined offer in the Delta campaign,” Boeing said in a statement after losing the order.

One media outlet inferred that this meant Airbus won on price, which is a common refrain from Boeing when it loses a campaign to Airbus. “While Delta has chosen to go with Airbus and Bombardier in recent single aisle campaigns, we are proud of the 737 MAX family’s superior value and performance,” Boeing said.

Boeing, of course, didn’t compete the MAX 7 against Bombardier in the Delta campaign and by LNC’s analysis, the MAX 10’s economics are marginally better (virtually within the margin of error), because the MAX 10 is lighter than the A321neo, but it is not the plus-5% Boeing claims. The MAX 10 has worse airport performance and less range than the A321neo.

But that’s neither here nor there.

Sure, Airbus offered an aggressive price. So did Boeing. But the clincher appears to be what Delta emphasized during its Investors’ Day event: the deal with Pratt & Whitney for future maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) work for Delta TechOps.

CEO Ed Bastien remarked several times that the MRO will mean billions of dollars in revenue over the life of the program. TechOps will have MRO capabilities for the PW GTF engine for all of the Americas, with an estimated 5,000 engines in the program over time.

Did CFM make a similar offer to Delta for the MAX? I don’t know the answer to that but I do know from my sources that Boeing salesmen sometimes complain that CFM won’t step up to the table to help because it has an exclusive position on the 737.

Material impact

In the end, the Delta order was probably Airbus’ to lose. A PR blow to Boeing? Sure. A material blow? Not even close. With more than 4,000 MAXes in backlog, 100-200 is immaterial.

Delta Air Lines announced a firm order for 100 Airbus A321neo airliners on Thursday with a list value of $12.7 billion. (Neo stands for new engine option.)

The Atlanta-based carrier also agreed to an option for 100 addition A321neo jets. Including options, the deal could potentially be worth up to $25.4 billion.

However, it is an industry norm for airlines to receive major discounts on bulk orders such as the one placed by Delta.

Delta also announced that Connecticut-based Pratt & Whitney's ultra-fuel-efficient next-generation geared-turbofan engine will power the 100 planes.

The aircraft will be used to replace Delta's aging fleet of McDonnell-Douglas jets that has served as the airline's workhouse for several decades.

According to Airbus, a significant number of the mega order will be produced at the manufacturer's plant in Mobile, Alabama with deliveries starting in early 2020 and ending in 2023.

Delta's A321neo's will have 197 seats, on-demand in-flight entertainment, high-speed satellite-based wifi, and overhead bins with 25% more space.

""The A321neo will equip Delta employees with a customer-preferred, versatile narrowbody aircraft befitting their position as a global airline leader — and we are excited to continue to partner with them as they deliver industry-leading operational performance, customer satisfaction, and financial results,"" Airbus Commercial Aircraft COO John Leahy said in a statement. ""In addition, our workforce at the U.S. Manufacturing Facility in Mobile, Alabama is proud that they will be delivering many of these A321neos to Delta in the coming years.""

The Delta order is expected to be the final mega-deal brokered by Airbus' legendary sales chief before his retirement at the end of the year.

This is just the latest in a series of orders Delta has placed with Airbus in recent years. The second largest airline in the world has ordered more than 130 current generation A321ceo jets along with major tranches of A330neo and A350XWB wide-body jets. (Ce0 stands for current engine option.)

Boeing's 737-MAX10 was also believed to be under consideration. But, a recent trade dispute triggered by a complaint filed by Boeing concerning Delta's order for 75 Bombardier C Series jets has soured the relationship between airline and airplane maker."
ESA tasks Airbus with streamlining Copernicus data access - SpaceNews,"Thu, 14 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9lc2EtdGFza3MtYWlyYnVzLXdpdGgtc3RyZWFtbGluaW5nLWNvcGVybmljdXMtZGF0YS1hY2Nlc3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON — Airbus has signed a contract with the European Space Agency to develop a Copernicus Data and Information Access Services, or DIAS, platform that will make data from the Earth-monitoring constellation more accessible to users from about mid-2018.

According to Airbus spokesman Jeremy Close, the contract is worth more the 10 million euros.

Airbus will be one of four DIAS providers, with each provider developing a separate platform using different software but the same data, according to Close.

Airbus cooperates on the development with its subcontractors including network operator Orange, professional services and business consulting corporation Capgemini, CLS and Vito.

The contract covers a four-year period with early operations expected to start in mid-2018.

The European Commission, which is responsible for Copernicus, tasked ESA with overseeing the development of DIAS in May this year to avoid the need to store and manage the data using its own computer systems.

Six Sentinel satellites that make up the Copernicus Earth observation constellation are already in orbit with further missions planned. According to an Airbus press release, the constellation generates as much data in one year as ESA’s previous Earth observation mission Envisat, which ended in 2012, would produce in half a century.

The goal of the DIAS platforms will be to provide a “one-stop shop on the cloud” for easy access to all Sentinel, as well as third party, data and processing tools and resources. The European Commission hopes the platform will encourage scientists, the general public and especially entrepreneurs to use the data to develop Earth observation data-based products and services.

“DIAS will simplify the data access for European citizens and will boost the creation of new business models based on Earth Observation,” said Mathilde Royer-Germain, head of Earth observation, navigation and science at Airbus.

Royer-Germain signed the contract today in Brussels together with Josef Aschbacher, ESA Director for Earth observation."

· COO and President Commercial Aircraft Fabrice Brégier to step down in February 2018

· Guillaume Faury, currently CEO Airbus Helicopters, to succeed Fabrice Brégier as President Airbus Commercial Aircraft

Amsterdam, 15 December 2017 – The Board of Directors of Airbus SE (stock exchange symbol: AIR) has decided on a series of Executive changes that ensure an orderly succession in the Executive leadership of Airbus.

Tom Enders (59) has advised the Board that he does not wish to seek another term as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) beyond his current mandate which runs until the 2019 Annual Shareholders Meeting (April 2019).

“The privilege of serving this great company comes with a responsibility to support a smooth succession when the time is ripe. In 2019, I will have served all together 14 years at the helm of Airbus and EADS. It’s been a long and exciting journey but now is the time to initiate a leadership change. We need fresh minds for the 2020s. In the coming 16 months, I will work with the Board to ensure a smooth transition to the next CEO and a new generation of leaders; I will focus on our business challenges; and I will further progress and strengthen our ethics and compliance programmes,” said Tom Enders.

Fabrice Brégier (56), Airbus Chief Operating Officer (COO) & President Airbus Commercial Aircraft has indicated to the Board that, as he does not intend to be part of the selection process for the CEO position in 2019, he will step down in February 2018 and pursue other interests.

“After 25 years with the company including five years as MBDA CEO, four years as CEO of Eurocopter and eleven years as COO, CEO or President of Airbus commercial aircraft, I feel the time is right to pursue other opportunities outside. I have been fully dedicated to Airbus and to its success during all these years, and up to my departure next year I will remain focused on meeting Airbus’ commitments to all stakeholders and on ensuring a smooth handover to my successor,” commented Fabrice Brégier.

“I understand Fabrice’s decision and his motives and, frankly, I would not have done differently,” said Enders. “Many of the achievements this company can be proud of over the past decade were led by Fabrice and me, together. Airbus is deeply grateful for his outstanding contribution to the operational excellence and competitiveness of our business.”

Guillaume Faury (49), currently CEO of Airbus Helicopters, will succeed Fabrice in his role as President Airbus Commercial Aircraft.

“I am honoured to have been entrusted with this new challenge, and I look forward to leading the inspiring commercial aircraft business of Airbus,” said Guillaume Faury.

“Guillaume represents our next generation of leaders and has demonstrated broad business and industry experience, an international mindset and a clear focus on delivering value during his tenure at the helm of our helicopter business. I look forward to working with him in his new role,” Enders said. “Guillaume’s succession at Airbus Helicopters will be decided and announced in the coming weeks.”

During 2018 the Board of Directors will assess both internal and external executives for the CEO role with a view to announcing Tom Enders’ successor in good time for confirmation at the 2019 AGM.

“The Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring orderly succession planning and the continuous development of the executive pipeline. We are confident we have taken the right decisions to ensure Airbus’ long term stability and future success and we fully support

Tom Enders to lead Airbus through this generational handover with our full support,” said Denis Ranque, Chairman of the Board of Airbus.

“I am very grateful to Fabrice Brégier for his dedication to the company during all these years and for his contribution to the success of Airbus, with its integration, its remarkable international development and the successful launch of new programmes such as the A350, the A320neo and the A330neo. We understand his desire to use this opportunity of change at the top of the company to pursue new opportunities after 25 years,” said Ranque.

Dec. 6, 2017, © Leeham Co.: The A330-800 entered the final assembly line last week at the Airbus production plant in Toulouse, France, amid doubts in the industry that the airplane will be produced beyond the prototype.

There is only one order for the sub-type, six from Hawaiian Airlines—and Hawaiian is expected to cancel the order. The airline is running a competition between the Airbus A350-900 and the Boeing 787-8/9, according to market intelligence.

Smaller is better

Hawaiian’s outgoing CEO, Mark Dunkerley, is known to prefer a smaller-capacity airplane in the size of the A330-800 or Boeing 787-8. Hawaiian had been one of the few customers for the A350-800, but was persuaded by Airbus to switch to the similarly-sized, but slightly shorter range, A330-800 when Airbus sought to de-risk the A350 program, reduce development costs and concentrate on the more profitable A350-900/1000 models.

At the peak, the A350-800 had 161 orders.

The A330-800 had about a dozen at its peak.

Orphan airplane

The A330-800 is an orphan airplane today, a status that is making it hard to sell. One major airline to which Airbus is making a pitch says it isn’t interested because it doesn’t want an orphan. Airbus counters that if this carrier ordered the airplane, it will make a market for it, market intelligence indicates. So far, the pitch is no sale.

Market will come

Airbus officials say they aren’t worried. The market will come as soon as 2020 as in-service A330-200s age. The long-haul, low-cost carriers and China present opportunities, Airbus says.

Crawford Hamilton, head of A330 product marketing, acknowledges the demand is slow for the -800 today, in part because of low fuel prices but principally because the in-service A330-200 fleet’s average age is less than 10 years old. (There is no relation between Hamilton and this writer.)

“We have 95 operators [of the A330],” Hamilton says, “so that’s lot of opportunities. We would concur they don’t want an orphan aircraft,” he says of the major airline that expressed concerns. “We have a lot of [potential sales] activity on -800. If things go well, we won’t have an orphan aircraft.

Hamilton sees good LCC market potential—”we know where our customer base is—” and he believes the A330-800 is the right size for it.

“If you want range, a very good solution is the 330 at 251t,” Hamilton says. “Long haul is very risky. The A330-800 has low break-even cost and interesting high density layouts. It can take 386 seats 6,000-6,500 nautical miles. It’s a good niche that we have.”

LNC’s analysis concludes that the A330-800 has 500nm more range than a similarly loaded 787-8.

“The great thing is the adaptability and flexibility. European charter guys like this and have been doing this for years. It has a very good seat count advantage against the [Boeing] 787-8, up to 30 more seats. This is a massive amount of revenue you can get on the upside.”

The -800 would be configured at nine abreast to achieve this capacity.

A330-800 vs the Boeing NMA

Airbus argues that the -800 covers the top of the Middle of the Market and with the A321neo, covers this sector. Boeing continues to study a new airplane but is not close to launching the program. LNC’s analysis of the Boeing NMA gives it a significant economic advantage over the -800, but the latter is available now. The entry-into-service date of the Boeing NMA, if launched next year or in early 2019, is a moving target.

Boeing officials continue to publicly say EIS is targeted for 2024-2025 but LNC revealed Monday that Boeing is now telling suppliers and the customer base 2027 seems more likely.

This works to Airbus’ advantage, says Hamilton.

“[The NMA] is possible competition in the future,” he says. “There is a value of time. How long are people going to wait for it?

“There are about 1,600 airplanes flying [in the MOM sector],” Hamilton says. “We have 95 operators for 330-200. The problem is the fleet is really, really, young. The average age is only nine years. There aren’t that many aircraft to replace today. These start to kick in beyond 2020. It would have been silly for us to develop the A330-900 and wait three or four years to develop the 800.

“The cherry on the cake is the 767-300/400, which are 15 years older,” Hamilton says. In the short term is the 767 market. Longer term are the 330-200s.

If not the NMA, then the 767

If airlines must wait 6-7 years, or worse, nine, for the Boeing NMA, what does Boeing do in the meantime?

It’s now been confirmed Boeing is studying whether to relaunch the 767-300ER passenger model as an interim airplane, principally for American and United airlines but possibly others.

Hamilton sees plenty of challenges for Boeing to restart the line.

“It’s going to be difficult; it’s a 30-year old aircraft and an interim solution,” he says. “You have to get seating standards up to 2025. What happens if the fuel price goes up? “You haven’t had a cabin in production for three years now and it will be another 2-3 before delivery.” The passenger service unit (PSU) and in-flight entertainment equipment are of old design. Even overhead bins are, by today’s standards, antiquated.

A330-800 vs 787-8

Hamilton isn’t worried about the 787-8, either, noting that in recent years Airbus sold, 85 A330-200s vs 26 787-8s.

Boeing’s plan is to produce about one 787-8 per month from 2020, the supply chain tells LNC, preferring to concentrate on the more profitable 787-9/10, which also have 95% commonality between the types vs about 50% between the -8 and its larger brethren.

As a consequence, LNC believes Boeing won’t be aggressive in 767 or A330 replacement campaigns with the 787-8. The A330-800 has more capacity and range than the 787-8. For LCCs which load the aircraft with 350+ passengers, this capacity and range advantage will be real.

At normal load-factors and cabins, one could discuss how many airlines need the 7,500nm or 15 hours capacity of the A330-800 or 787-8. But with LCC cabins, the payload reduces the capability to typically 10-12 hours of the long-range leisure destination and there the A330-800 (in its 251t version) is a stronger aircraft than the 787-8.

Conclusion

The A330-800 has a market. Long range LCC is perhaps the best chance outside domestic China (where the A330-200R and -300R dominate for now). The dense cabins increase the payload to the level where the range of the A330-800 is in the bracket of a normally loaded A330-300 or -900. The A330-900 is then a less-than-10-hour aircraft.

When configured for long-range LCC, the A330-800 outperforms the 787-8 both in seating and range. The difference in fuel consumption is small enough (around 3% more) for the LCC to not take a risk with a A330-800 instead of the more costly (to buy or lease) 787-8.

With an amortized production line, the A330-800 can be sold at the prices needed to make long-range LCC work.

Less than two years after Airbus delivered the first A320 Family aircraft from its Airbus A320 Family U.S. Manufacturing Facility in Mobile, Alabama, the company today delivered its 50th aircraft. The A321, designated MSN 7943, was delivered to Delta Air Lines.

The milestone was celebrated by the facility’s employees, as well as Airbus Americas Chairman Allan McArtor and members of the Delta Air Lines delivery team.

“The 50th delivery is a real point of pride not only for our team here in Mobile, but also for tens of thousands of employees from the hundreds of U.S. suppliers that contribute to these aircraft,” said McArtor. “We said in 2012 that we were going to build Airbus aircraft in the U.S. for our U.S.-based customers. We delivered the first aircraft in 2016, and today we stand here celebrating the 50th. We’ve met our originally announced schedule, and we’ve fulfilled the commitment we made to our customers, our suppliers across the country, and this Gulf Coast community.”

Daryl Taylor, Vice President & General Manager of the Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility praised the team that builds the aircraft. “Team Mobile’s hard work and dedication have brought us to this milestone. We’ve built a great team who together are building great aircraft, meeting challenges head-on and continually seeking ways to improve.”

With the delivery this week, the facility also meets its goal to produce four A320 family aircraft a month – known in the aircraft industry as “rate four.” Airbus has three other A320 Family production facilities around the world: Toulouse, France; Hamburg, Germany; and Tianjin, China.

Project includes cabin upgrades for 202 A321s

Airbus takes major step into US services market with its largest-ever cabin retrofit contract

American Airlines (AAL) has chosen Services by Airbus to provide cabin upgrades for 202 of its A321s in-service – the largest retrofit project in Airbus history. The airline will be the first retrofit customer for Airbus’ new Airspace XL bins. The larger bins provide a 40 percent increase in storage space for carry-on bags, reducing bin crowding and the need to check bags at the gate, allowing a more relaxed boarding experience to both passengers and cabin crews.

“Thanks to this Airbus cabin retrofit, passengers on American Airlines’ A321s will be able to board faster and will enjoy anoverall improved travel experience,” said Laurent Martinez, Head of Services by Airbus. “This is exactly the type of added-value that our services can bring to airlines. This contract is a major step for Airbus into the US services market, and we are grateful to American Airlines for their trust in our expertise.”

The upgrades are part of a project which will standardise American Airlines’ A321s with a common seat count and interior, providing passengers with a consistent travel experience. New production A321s for American Airlines will also be equipped with Airspace XL bins.



Airbus’ Global Services Forecast projects that over the next 20 years the commercial aircraft upgrades services market will be worth US$180 billion, driven in part by high competition between airlines who value the ‘passenger experience’ as a differentiator (comfort, connectivity, etc.), as well as systems upgrades. Fourteen percent of this demand will come from North America."

Performed on an H225 flying testbed, the trials have demonstrated the system’s ability to select a small ground “target” from ranges of up to 2 miles and to automatically track it during the approach performed by the pilot. The flight tests have also validated Eagle’s architecture and main components, such as the gyrostabilized optronics package and the processing unit. The next steps of the testing campaign will focus on coupling Eagle with the automatic flight control system to fully automatise the approach to a selected landing area.

Codenamed Eagle (Eye for Autonomous Guidance and Landing Extension), this research project aims to federate the entire helicopter’s image processing functions and feed them into the avionics system, thus improving the crew’s situation awareness and reducing the pilot’s workload by automating and securing approaches, take-off and landing in the most demanding environments. The system is designed to be integrated on a variety of existing and future Airbus vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) vehicles.

Airbus ready to phase-out A380 if no Emirates deal - report - ch-aviation,"Sat, 30 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoLWF2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS9wb3J0YWwvbmV3cy82MjkyMS1haXJidXMtcmVhZHktdG8tcGhhc2Utb3V0LWEzODAtaWYtbm8tZW1pcmF0ZXMtZGVhbC1yZXBvcnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus (AIB, Toulouse Blagnac) is working on a backup plan to phase-out A380-800 production if the manufacturer fails to secure a new order with Emirates (EK, Dubai International), Reuters reported citing inside sources.

""If there is no Emirates deal, Airbus will start the process of ending A380 production,"" one of the newswire's sources said.

The European manufacturer and the Dubai-based carrier have been in talks regarding a new order for the aircraft for some time now. Negotiations covering thirty-six new A380-800s broke down during this year's Dubai Air Show, Reuters stated. Emirates publicly demanded a guarantee that Airbus will keep the A380 production line open for at least another ten years before the airline can commit to further purchases.

The Gulf carrier is by far the largest operator of the type. According to the ch-aviation fleets module, it currently employs 101 A380-800s out of a total of 224 built. Emirates has a further forty-one aircraft on order. The second-largest operator of the type, Singapore Airlines, currently operates seventeen aircraft and expects four more, but it has also already retired three aircraft this year and plans to withdraw one more by March 2018.

In total, the manufacturer secured contracts for 317 A380-800s, although not all of them are likely to be fulfilled.

Airbus had earlier stated it plans to cut down the A380 production rate from twelve a year in 2018 to six a year beyond 2019."

Boeing has the lead with nearly 900 orders.

This is the last hurrah for retiring Airbus sales chief John Leahy.

Airbus is pulling out the stops to try and take the lead in its annual order contest with Boeing, lining up a spree of billion-dollar deals to close a traumatic year dominated by management upheaval and corruption investigations.

Deals announced this week include confirmation of a record 430-jet order brokered by U.S.-based private equity firm Indigo Partners on behalf of four airlines. But analysts said Airbus may have to offer large discounts to close the gap with Boeing.

The Indigo deal and up to 275 other last-minute orders are seen as a swan song for Airbus sales chief John Leahy, who is due to retire in January after roughly trebling Airbus's market share in his 23 years at the helm.

Related stories

Airbus has endured what insiders describe as a painful year, falling sharply behind Boeing and seeing its sales teams demoralized by the impact of UK and French probes into the use of middlemen by a now-disbanded headquarters unit.

Its share price is nonetheless near record highs as the planemaker recovers from recent production problems. Looking to retire on a high, Leahy is seen keen to sell at least as many aircraft as the 700 jets Airbus expects to deliver in 2017 - after revising the internal target up from 400 earlier this year when the industry was slowing sharply.

But many observers expect the New Yorker to go further and try to match Boeing, which reported 844 net orders up to Dec. 19 and is believed to be closer to the 900 mark now. Airbus has announced deals for a total of 705 narrowbody jets since the end of November, lifting its potential catch for the year above 1,000 before adjusting for cancellations.

Recent deals include 100 jets to Delta Air Lines, 50 each to lessors AerCap and China Aircraft Leasing (CALC) and 75 spread between two other airlines.

The mad dash for airplane orders

Whether Airbus completes a surprise comeback depends on how many of the latest orders are net additions to the order book.



Hungary's Wizz Air said its share of the Indigo order, comprising 146 jets, needed shareholder approval.



If all deals announced by Airbus since the start of December are included in the end-year total, then two-thirds of the year's business will have been done in the final month, compared with an average of 20 percent in the previous 10 years.



Analysts and industry sources said such a spree could hurt profit margins as the planemaker offers concessions to get deals across the line.



Indigo Partners will have negotiated exceptionally low prices for its block order, while lessors AerCap and CALC were said to be attracted by steep discounts, they added.



""Indigo is a sign of investors boxing up plane orders for airlines, but that's not good for margins as it increases buyers' power,"" said Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia.



Airbus sources said pricing was driven by the size of the deals and denied making unusual concessions.



Both Airbus and Boeing have deep pockets to offer discounts on best-selling narrowbody jets, where they make the most profit.



""This industry is above all a volume game,"" Aboulafia said.



By contrast, it has been a poor year for orders of Airbus wide-body jets. The planemaker has sold 46 so far this year and has been outsold more than three to one by Boeing, whose Dreamliner sales are at their highest since 2013.



Despite doubts over the future of the world's largest airliner, the A380, Airbus still hopes to clinch an order for 36 from Dubai's Emirates. Talks broke down at last month's Dubai Airshow, but have since resumed, industry sources say.



That hasn't prevented Airbus making plans to phase out A380 output if the Emirates deal is abandoned, Reuters reported this week. While others show interest, few can buy in the volumes Airbus needs to commit to keeping its lines open.



However, Airbus is also betting that if Emirates does buy, this will be a catalyst for other sales, Reuters reported.



Airbus described the report as ""speculation."""

Hawaiian Airlines will add new non-stop service between San Diego and Kahului on the island of Maui.

Hawaiian will fly the route with its brand new Airbus A321neo narrowbody jets, offering one daily round-trip flight starting May 1. Kahului will be Hawaiian's second route from San Diego. It already flies to its main hub in Honolulu.

Hawaiian also is turning to its new A321neos to help it increase its summertime schedule on two existing routes. Hawaiian’s San Francisco-Honolulu service will get an extra flight from May 25 through July 31 while its service between Oakland and Kona on the “Big Island” of Hawaii will feature an additional flight from May 26 through Sept. 2.

Elsewhere, Hawaiian is adding an extra summertime flight on its Honolulu-Tokyo Narita and (Aug. 1-Sept. 30) and Los Angeles-Kahului (June 1-Aug. 31) routes. Those extra flights will be on Airbus A330 widebody jets.

“We are delighted to offer travelers more options to visit our islands next summer,” Peter Ingram, Hawaiian’s chief commercial officer, said in a statement.

Ingram is set to take over as the company's CEO in March,when current CEO Mark Dunkerley retires. (Related: Hawaiian Airlines CEO to retire in March, replacement named)

Hawaiian took delivery of its initial Airbus A321neo in November, the first of 18 the carrier has on order. Hawaiian's A321neos seat 189 passengers, including 16 in business class seats and 45 in an extra-legroom economy section. The remaining 128 are standard coach-class seats.

The A321neo arrived to Hawaiian amid great fanfare. The A321neo is a next-generation update to Airbus’ popular A320 family of narrowbody jets, with the “neo” stemming from “new engine option.” The updated narrowbody aircraft is more efficient than preceding models, allowing carriers to fly the new version farther distances at normal passenger and cargo levels.

With that, Hawaiian has pledged that the A321neo will help it open new long routes between Hawaii and the U.S. West Coast. Hawaiian also is counting on its new A321s to help it phase out its aging Boeing 767 widebodies.

Meanwhile, the introduction of the A321neo into regularly scheduled service for Hawaiian now appears as though it will come nearly a month earlier than expected.

Hawaiian originally said its A321neos would first begin flying paying passengers Jan. 8. That was to come as Hawaiian began to slot the A321neos into service on its existing route between Oakland and Kahului.

Now, FlightGlobal reports Hawaiian plans to begin using the A32neos on Dec. 19, deploying them on existing intra-Hawaii routes. Those routes – Honolulu-Maui, Honolulu-Kona and Honolulu-Lihue (Kauai) – are intended to be “crew familiarization"" flights that give workers a chance to learn the new aircraft ahead of a broader roll-out.

The moment of truth for the slow-selling airliner looms after just 10 years in service and leaves one of Europe’s most visible international symbols hanging by a thread, despite a major airline investment in new cabins unveiled this month.

""If there is no Emirates deal, Airbus will start the process of ending A380 production,"" a person briefed on the plans said.

A supplier added such a move was logical due to weak demand. Airbus and Emirates declined to comment. Airbus also declined to say how many people work on the project.

Gradual shutdown?

Any shutdown is expected to be gradual, allowing Airbus to produce orders it has in hand, mainly from Emirates. It has enough orders to last until early next decade at current production rates, according to a Reuters analysis.

The A380 was developed at a cost of 11 billion euros to carry some 500 people and challenge the reign of the Boeing 747. But demand for these four-engined goliaths has fallen as airlines choose smaller twin-engined models, which are easier to fill and cheaper to maintain.

Emirates, however, has been a strong believer in the A380 and is easily the largest customer with total orders of 142 aircraft, of which it has taken just over 100.

Talks between Airbus and Emirates over a new order for 36 superjumbos worth $16 billion broke down at the Dubai Airshow last month. Negotiations are said to have resumed, but there are no visible signs that a deal is imminent.

British Airways interested

Although airlines such as British Airways have expressed interest in the A380, Airbus is reluctant to keep factories open without the certainty that a bulk Emirates order would provide.

Emirates, for its part, wants a guarantee that Airbus will keep production going for a decade to protect its investment.

A decision to cancel would mark a rupture between Airbus and one of its largest customers and tie Emirates’ future growth to recent Boeing orders.

European sources say that reflects growing American influence in the Gulf under President Donald Trump, but U.S. and UAE industry sources deny politics are involved. There are also potential hurdles to a deal over engine choices and after-sales support.

Safety net

Yet if talks succeed, European sources say there is a glimmer of hope for the double-deck jet, which Airbus says will become more popular with airlines due to congestion.

Singapore Airlines, which first introduced the A380 to passengers in 2007, showcased an $850 million cabin re-design this month and expressed confidence in the model's future.

Airbus hopes to use an Emirates order to stabilize output and establish a safety net from which to attract A380 sales to other carriers, but has ruled out trying to do this the other way round, industry sources said.

As of the end of November, Airbus had won orders for 317 A380s and delivered 221, leaving 96 unfilled orders. But based on airlines' intentions or finances, 47 of those are unlikely to be delivered, according to industry sources, which halves the number of jets in play.

30 orders needed

Airbus needs to sell at least another 30 to keep lines open for 10 years and possibly more to justify the price concessions likely to be demanded by any new buyers.

To bridge the gap, Airbus plans to cut output to six a year beyond 2019, from 12 in 2018 and 8 in 2019, even if it means producing at a loss, Reuters recently reported.

Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier confirmed this month Airbus was looking at cutting output to 6-7 a year.

If Airbus does decide to wind down production, some believe Emirates will ask Airbus to deliver the remaining 41 it has on order and then keep most A380s in service as long as possible. Even so, some A380s are likely to be heading for scrap."
Faury to leave Airbus Helicopters and join Airbus Commercial - Vertical Magazine,"Fri, 15 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvZmF1cnktbGVhdmUtYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLWpvaW4tYWlyYnVzLWNvbW1lcmNpYWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters CEO Guillaume Faury is to leave his position and become president of Airbus Commercial Aircraft from February 2018, Airbus announced on Dec. 15.

Faury will replace Fabrice Bregier (himself a former head of Airbus’ helicopter business), who is going to pursue “other interests.” The moves take place amidst a top management crisis at Airbus, as the company is facing corruption allegations and other regulatory scrutiny in multiple countries.

“I am honored to have been entrusted with this new challenge, and I look forward to leading the inspiring commercial aircraft business of Airbus,” said Faury.

“Until then, I’ll continue to focus on achieving our year-end objectives here at Airbus Helicopters,” he added.

His successor will be decided and announced “in the coming weeks,” Airbus said. “Guillaume . . . has demonstrated broad business and industry experience, an international mindset, and a clear focus on delivering value during his tenure at the helm of our helicopter business,” Airbus chief executive officer Tom Enders said.

Faury marked a change of style when he replaced a flamboyant Lutz Bertling as CEO of then-Eurocopter in May 2013. He was technologically less ambitious and simultaneously more cost-conscious. The H160, albeit innovative, still has a conventional cockpit, unlike the revolutionary helicopter Bertling had in mind. The H160, somewhat Faury’s baby, can be seen as the first in a new generation of Airbus rotorcraft, more focused on user experience.

Faury advocated the use of production processes inspired from the automotive sector. After having left Eurocopter a first time in 2008, he had spent four years with car manufacturer Peugeot. The H160’s assembly line is said to have a greater level of automation, inspired by the automotive sector.

As Airbus Helicopters’ CEO, Faury faced fatal Super Puma crashes and the resulting technical and reputational storm. He also had to cope with a major downturn on the helicopter market, but he managed to increase market shares, including a recent rebound in H225 sales.

Last month, he announced the termination of the H120 program, citing a dichotomy between the lower end of the light single market and the company’s “high added value” products.

Separately, he fully supported the change of name to Airbus Helicopters four years ago.

Moving from Marignane to Airbus Commercial Aircraft’s Toulouse headquarters, Faury will reunite with Jean-Brice Dumont, who is taking over as head of engineering at Airbus Commercial Aircraft after having had the same job at Airbus Helicopters, until February this year."
Airbus H160 entry into service slips to late 2019 - Vertical Magazine,"Fri, 01 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWgxNjAtZW50cnktc2VydmljZS1zbGlwcy1sYXRlLTIwMTkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The H160, which Airbus Helicopters is developing to regain a significant share on the medium twin market, is halfway into its flight test campaign but will not enter service until late 2019, due to the redesign of some dynamic components.

The H160’s Safran Arrano turboshaft engine is scheduled to be certified late in 2018, without any major delay. But the situation is different for the airframe. Now planned for the end of 2019, the aircraft’s entry into service had originally been envisaged for 2018.

“We had several technical issues ; redesigning a part can take several months and some complex parts have long production cycles,” head of program Bernard Fujarski explained. For instance, the loads measured on some components of the main gearbox in flight test were higher than expected.

Slightly more than 550 flight hours have been accumulated, mostly by the first two prototypes. The third and final prototype entered service in October and has since flown about 20 hours. Testing has begun on an inlet barrier filter that is expected to be useful in harsh environments, such as desert and polluted cities, Fujarski said.

Certification testing of the aircraft is in progress and will account for most of flight testing activity next year. Although some evaluations in snowy conditions have already been performed, Airbus is keeping one of the prototypes ready for further flying in similar weather. The goal is to find a heavy snowfall with “very wet” snow, as required for certification.

As for hot weather, enough data has been gathered for certification, Fujarski said. But Airbus wants to “go beyond” that initial set of data and is considering a dedicated test campaign next year, probably in the U.S.

Flight-test crews are still assessing various settings on the biplane stabilizer, which has been designed for improved main rotor efficiency.

The fuselage of the first customer aircraft is to arrive late this year at the Marignane, France, final assembly line (FAL). It is being manufactured at another Airbus facility in Donauwörth, Germany. The first customer aircraft is scheduled to fly in October 2018.

The airframer is keeping quiet on sales, not giving any indication of the number of orders – if any. From late 2022, Airbus plans to manufacture 40 copies of the H160 every year. The objective is to “restore the market share we had in the Dauphin’s most successful years – 40 percent,” Fujarski said. The Leonardo AW139 is seen as the main competitor.

The French ministry of defense is considering ordering 160 H160s for its various forces – the army, the air force and the navy. The first two FALs for the H160 will have a combined capacity of “50 to 55” aircraft per year. France’s military order, if confirmed, may imply the creation of a third FAL.

To prepare the H160’s entry into service, the manufacturer launched an “Operator Zero” effort last summer. Putting themselves in the shoes of an operator, Airbus maintenance engineers perform the actions on the prototypes that an operator would perform on their aircraft. The maintenance instructions the Airbus employees use are identical – with leeway for improvement – to the ones for production aircraft. Operators witness the maintenance and advise the manufacturer.

A full flight simulator, designed by Thales, is planned to be ready as soon as the first aircraft is delivered.

In addition to the biplane stabilizer, the H160 features numerous innovations. They include Blue Edge main rotor blades for quieter operation and greater lift, the house-developed Helionix avionics suite that can be found on the H145 and H175, a full composite airframe, and an electric landing gear."
Delta Air Lines places order for 100 A321neo ACF aircraft - Airbus,"Thu, 14 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0xMi1kZWx0YS1haXItbGluZXMtcGxhY2VzLW9yZGVyLWZvci0xMDAtYTMyMW5lby1hY2YtYWlyY3JhZnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Underscores airline’s confidence in Airbus single-aisle family

Delta Air Lines today placed an order with Airbus for 100 of the manufacturer’s modern A321neo ACF (Airbus Cabin Flex configuration) aircraft. The U.S.-based carrier selected the largest member of Airbus’ single-aisle Family to meet Delta’s future requirements for aircraft with greater efficiency and additional capacity. The airline’s A321neo ACF planes will be powered by Pratt & Whitney PW1133G-JM geared turbofan engines.

“This is the right transaction at the right time for our customers, our employees and our shareholders,” said Delta CEO Ed Bastian. “Delta, Airbus and Pratt & Whitney share the same commitment to safety, efficiency, innovation and continuously improving the customer experience. This order for the state-of-the-art A321neo with Pratt’s Pure Power next-generation jet engines reflects our long-term commitment to these values for Delta people and all our constituents.”

“We at Airbus are very happy we won this hotly-contested campaign, together with our partner Pratt, and we are proud to serve Delta with the A321neo. This important order will further strengthen our partnership with Delta - one of the world’s best airlines - which we have developed over many years.” said Tom Enders, Airbus Chief Executive Officer. “It is also good news for our employees in Mobile, Alabama, where most of the Delta planes will be manufactured. We look forward to seeing the A321neo ACF flying in Delta colours soon.”



Delta’s announcement on the A321neo ACF follows several orders in recent years for the current engine option (ceo) version of the A321. Delta has ordered a total of 117 A321ceos, each powered by CFM56 engines from CFM International.

The A321neo ACF introduces new door and fuselage enhancements that allow airlines to make best use of the cabin space with a range of up to 4,000 nautical miles. The A321 is the largest member of the A320 Family, seating up to 240 passengers. Incorporating the latest engines, aerodynamic advances, and cabin innovations, the A321neo will offer a significant reduction in fuel consumption of 20 percent by 2020. With more than 5,300 orders received from 96 customers since its launch in 2010, the A320neo Family has captured some 60 percent share of the market.

Most of Delta’s A321neos will be delivered from the Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility in Mobile, Alabama. The airline has taken delivery of 13 U.S.-manufactured Airbus aircraft since last year. In addition, the 50th aircraft to be produced by the Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility will be delivered to Delta later this week. The Mobile factory produces four aircraft per month for delivery to Airbus’ U.S. customers. Plans for further production ramp up are currently being discussed.

In addition to Airbus’ U.S. manufacturing, the company has a long and strong partnership with American aerospace supplier companies. Today, there is more U.S. content in Airbus aircraft than from any other country, with more than 40% of the company’s aircraft-related procurement coming from the United States.

As of the end of November, Delta was flying a fleet of 196 Airbus aircraft, including 150 A320 Family members, 42 A330 widebodies, and four A350 XWB aircraft."
Airbus CEO to step down after contract ends; COO on the way out - Defense News,"Fri, 15 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS8yMDE3LzEyLzE1L2FpcmJ1cy1jZW8tdG8tc3RlcC1kb3duLWFmdGVyLWNvbnRyYWN0LWVuZHMtY29vLW9uLXRoZS13YXktb3V0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — The head of Airbus will leave the European aircraft manufacturer in February, while the chief executive of the parent company will not seek a renewal when his contract ends in 2019, Airbus said Friday.

“The board of directors of Airbus SE (stock exchange symbol: AIR) has decided on a series of executive changes that ensure an orderly succession in the executive leadership of Airbus,” the company said in a statement.

Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier will leave Airbus’ commercial aircraft division in February, with the head of Airbus Helicopters, Guillaume Faury, taking up the post, the company said.

Bregier was the No. 2 at Airbus, and his departure signals the end of a bitter struggle with Enders, business daily Les Echos reported. The two top executives struggled over how to tackle corporate governance as British and French authorities investigated alleged bribery.

Airbus CEO Tom Ender told the board of directors he would not seek a fresh mandate after his present contract, which runs to April 2019.

“We need fresh minds for the 2020s,” Enders said. “In the coming 16 months, I will work with the board to ensure a smooth transition to the next CEO and a new generation of leaders.”

Enders will keep a close eye on business ethics in his remaining time at Airbus.

“I will focus on our business challenges; and I will further progress and strengthen our ethics and compliance programs,” he said.

Bregier noted his lengthy service and his years at the Airbus missile and helicopter units.

“After 25 years with the company including five years as MBDA CEO, four years as CEO of Eurocopter and 11 years as COO, CEO or president of Airbus commercial aircraft, I feel the time is right to pursue other opportunities outside,” Bregier said.

The imminent departure of Bregier and announced exit of Enders signal difficult times at Airbus, an analyst said.

“Leahy’s departure, now Enders and Bregier — it’s not healthy for the company,” said Sash Tusa, an analyst with equity research firm Agency Partners. “The big question is: Who will be Ender’s successor?”

John Leahy, Airbus’ top salesman, leaves the company next year as he hits retirement age.

The Airbus board will consider internal and external candidates for the next CEO of Airbus Group, an appointment intended to assure corporate stability, the company said.

“The board of directors is responsible for ensuring orderly succession planning and the continuous development of the executive pipeline,” said Denis Ranque, Airbus chairman.

“We are confident we have taken the right decisions to ensure Airbus’ long-term stability and future success, and we fully support Tom Enders to lead Airbus through this generational handover with our full support,” he added.

The British Serious Fraud Office opened an inquiry in 2016 after Airbus contacted the U.K. authorities and passed on its concerns on corporate payments made to sales agents. The French Parquet National Financier fraud office joined that British probe.

The French government is keeping a close eye on the investigations, website La Tribune reported. Bruno Le Maire, France’s economy and finance minister, told La Tribune he had been “briefed” on the allegations when he took up office at the ministry.

“I immediately asked the chairman of the board of Airbus to see me so I could ask him to deliver full transparency on the allegations, to give explanation, to give a full explanation to the French state, and beyond those explanations to present a battle plan on how it will put some order into the company,” he said.

France is a shareholder in Airbus but no longer has a seat on the board.

Airbus called in the British authorities once an internal review ordered by Enders in 2015 revealed information on payments made to middlemen on foreign sales of airliners, Les Echos reported. Under the recent French anti-corruption law Sapin II, a company may avoid a criminal prosecution if executives can show preventive measures were taken and reported the concern to the authorities. The Anglo-French inquiry is expected to last years.

In a surprise announcement, Delta Air Lines said Thursday the company will order 100 Airbus A321neo airliners, with an option for 100 more. Boeing had been seen as the preferred bidder with its 737 Max 10, an analyst said."
First A330-300P2F enters service with DHL - Airbus,"Fri, 01 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0xMi1maXJzdC1hMzMwLTMwMHAyZi1lbnRlcnMtc2VydmljZS13aXRoLWRobNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Express operations benefit from new-generation efficient mid-sized freighter

DHL Express has become the first operator to take delivery of the A330-300 Passenger-to-Freighter (P2F) converted aircraft from Elbe Flugzeugwerke (EFW), the joint venture between ST Aerospace and Airbus. This delivery, which took place at EFW’s freighter conversion facilities in Dresden, follows the successful completion of test flights in October and awarding of the Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in November. DHL Express has firm orders for eight A330-300P2F units in total, with additional options to receive another 10.

“DHL Express is very excited to be bringing the first A330-300 P2F into commercial operation within our international air network,” said Geoff Kehr, SVP, Global Air Fleet Management, DHL Express. “The first aircraft is scheduled to strengthen our Asia Pacific air network, bringing added capacity and increased efficiency to a market where we are seeing dynamic express volume growth.”

“We congratulate DHL on the delivery of its first A330-300P2F. We are confident that this new-generation and efficient mid-sized freighter will bring significant benefits to DHL’s international express operations,” said Christopher Buckley, Airbus EVP Sales. “With its large internal volume and unbeatable economics, the A330-300P2F allows operators to step up capacity in markets where existing mid-sized freighters are becoming too small.”

The A330P2F conversion programme, launched in 2012, is a collaboration between ST Aerospace, Airbus and their joint venture EFW. ST Aerospace, as the programme and technical lead for the engineering development phase, is responsible for applying for the STCs from EASA and the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Airbus contributes to the programme with OEM data and certification support, while EFW leads the industrialisation phase and marketing for the freighter conversion programme.

The A330P2F programme has two variants – the A330-200P2F and the larger A330-300P2F. The latter is ideal for serving the international express B2B and e-commerce cargo markets, which typically have a higher volume and lower density. The aircraft can carry up to 62 metric tonnes over 3,650 nautical miles, while offering 20 percent more cargo volume and lower cost-per-tonne than other available freighter aircraft types with a similar range."
Will the world’s largest passenger airliner — the A380 — ever come to Denver? - The Denver Post,"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcnBvc3QuY29tLzIwMTcvMTIvMTEvYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtaW4tZGVudmVyL9IBQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcnBvc3QuY29tLzIwMTcvMTIvMTEvYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtaW4tZGVudmVyL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The world’s largest passenger aircraft — the Airbus A380, a double-decker whale of a plane — has never landed at Denver International Airport, one of the nation’s largest airports.

And as of now, even with projections for continued population growth in Denver and across Colorado and DIA’s increasing notoriety as a worldwide hub, it doesn’t look like the behemoth is coming to the Mile High City anytime soon.

So what are the chances travelers will get a chance to ride on the A380 to or from DIA in the near future? They look to be pretty slim.

With domestic passenger airlines phasing out the nearly-as-large Boeing 747 by year’s end — United had its last 747 flight on Nov. 7, which came on the heels of a farewell at DIA — large planes are falling out of style across the nation and world.

Carriers are opting instead for more fuel-efficient wide-body planes, from the Boeing 777 and 787 to the Airbus A350 and A330.

Two carriers that fly the A380 operate out of Denver — British Airways and Lufthansa — but they probably won’t use the plane on their routes to Colorado anytime soon.

“We are always talking with airlines,” said DIA spokesman Heath Montgomery, adding that the airport has been in conversations with A380 operator Emirates. “It’s really about the economics of each flight and whether that’s the most cost-effective option for them.”

DIA’s six runways, including one that is among the longest in the U.S., are all certified to handle an A380, although the plane — should it ever come to Denver — would probably have limited taxiing routes on the tarmac.

“We do have a plan in place to accommodate it,” Montgomery said.

Howard Mann, vice president of the Virginia-based Campbell-Hill Aviation Group, said dollars and cents drive airline decisions about where to fly their A380s, which can carry more than 500 passengers. Their considerations include route popularity, passenger interest in the aircraft’s high number of business and first-class seats, and efficiency.

The A380, which has a wingspan of 261 feet and is 238 feet long and nearly 80 feet tall, takes dozens of flight attendants and ground staff to keep the plane running and flying smoothly.

“Every airline has to make a business decision about what’s the role of that destination in their network,” he said.

Lufthansa and British Airways, for instance, have about two dozen A380s between them, using those planes to ferry passengers to long-haul destinations such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Hong Kong and Johannesburg. Some airlines use the massive plane as a high-capacity solution to their limited landing slots at Asian destinations.

There are also reports that Airbus is struggling to sell the A380 and that the plane builder could stop producing the super-jumbo jet.

Middle East carriers, such as Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways, may look to fly an A380 into Denver, but that, Mann says, is only likely if there are established business or educational ties to their home countries — for instance, if a major company opens in Denver that has operations or trade in Dubai, or if the state’s universities and colleges begin to draw a large number of students from the region.

“The A380, it’s all about the economics,” he said."

Lima, 07/12/2017 – PerúSAT-1 has completed its first year of operation and the Peruvian government has recently declared that in that time, the investment it has made into the satellite programme has already been recouped. The Earth observation satellite, built by Airbus in a record time of only two years, has acquired more than 71,000 images which have been delivered to more than 80 organisations across Peru. Peruvian specialists from the National Satellite Image Operation Centre (CNOIS) located in Pucusana, near Lima, have been in control of the satellite since handover from Airbus on December 7th, 2016. PerúSAT-1 is the most advanced satellite in the region.



The Earth observation satellite system PerúSAT-1 provides very high resolution imagery for multiple applications, including security and defence, agriculture, mining, illegal deforestation, risk prevention, mapping, urban planning, land use, ecological economy zoning, countering drug trafficking, among others. The satellite system includes a next-generation satellite, with optical sub-metric resolution of 70 centimetres and a design lifetime of 10 years. It also includes the construction of the CNOIS as the Satellite Control Centre and the processing and management of the images acquired. In addition the system encompassed a technology transfer programme and preparation comprehensive training for the team that operates the satellite today.



PerúSAT-1 embeds technologies that combine readiness and performance; it has been designed to carry out diverse Earth observation missions for monitoring and better managing the environment. All these technologies are employed to serve the needs of Peru. Thus the satellite system provides Peru with a sovereign capacity and plays a key role in providing the benefits of space to its citizens.



Peru’s Space Agency (CONIDA) has been collaborating and working in coordination with many state institutions that receive the satellite images and developed products that benefit people’s everyday lives. Current activities include:



General Attorney’s office: detection of irregularities in public works

Peru’s National Police: drug trafficking intelligence and property identification

Vitor District Municipality: evaluation and analysis of frequent landslides in the Vitor basin

San Martín Region: map generation to track deforestation

National Institute for Civil Defence (INDECI): strategic collaboration in response to natural disasters through products and images of affected zones

National Geographical Institute (IGN): generation of the national cartography, scale 1:25,000, reducing the project’s cost

Geology, Mining and Metallurgic Institute (INGEMMET): landslides and volcano monitoring

National Superintendence of State Assets (SBN): strategic collaboration for the monitoring and protection of national assets

United Nation’s Development Programme (UNPD): elaboration of a database of satellite imagery, aerial reconnaissance and field data for a post disaster evaluation in Lima and Callao after earthquakes

Mountain and jungle exploration: strategic support for product elaboration in precision agriculture

San Marcos Mayor National University (UNMSM): generation of a spectral signature data base

CEVAN, PNP, OEFA: capacity development in the use and processing of satellite imagery

The PerúSAT-1 satellite, built by Airbus, is the first of its kind to be delivered in a record time. It took less than two years from commissioning to delivery. Based on the AstroBus-S platform used in the new generation of high performance satellites, it is designed for a lifetime of 10 years.

PerúSAT-1 in numbers:



70 cm Resolution

10 years lifetime

Only 2 years to build, a record

71,000 images in the first year of operation

15 million km2 of the Earth surface already imaged

14 months in orbit, more than 6,300 revolutions around the planet

Imagery used by more than 80 Peruvian organisations for more than 20 different applications

My wife and I booked first class awards in Singapore’s Suites from Sydney to Paris, with a stopover for a couple of days in Singapore. These were one-way awards, and Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer charged $100 each for the stopover. This had to be booked by phone, and I had no problem placing the reservation on hold.

I transferred points that had been earned with the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card into my Singapore Airlines account and booking was easy. Of course I had no idea when I reserved the award tickets for myself and my wife that the flights would be so empty up front!

We walked over from the Singapore Airlines first class lounge in Sydney to the gate. An Air New Zealand flight was leaving from the gate next door at around the same time, so the place was pretty packed. We were also a few minutes behind schedule so we waited around a bit, with nowhere to sit. But the wait would be worth it.

Singapore Airlines ‘Suites Class’ is a ten year old product. They’ve just revealed the new suites they’re going to roll out replacing these, but they’re still to this day one of the most gorgeous first class products in the sky.

For example, Emirates has four suites across (one in each window and two in the middle) on the upper deck of their Airbus A380s. Singapore has four across on the wider lower deck. So these are super spacious seats.

One of those ‘wow’ moments at the beginning of a Singapore Airlines flight in first class — besides the cabin itself — is when a flight attendant comes by and asks if you’d like some champagne.

It’s such a modest question, but when you accept it’s followed up with this mic drop: would you prefer Dom Perignon or Krug? Yes, it’s really up to you. And I’ve long said that I believe the only correct response to this question is “what year is the Dom?” since the Krug (preferred by many) is the non-vintage blend while the Dom Perignon is variable in quality year-by-year.

Of course for a limited time Singapore is serving $300 vintage bottles of Krug so take that while you can! My flight though featured the non-vintage, but still exceptionally lovely, Krug.

Bose noise cancelling headphones were distributed next.

Oh, what the heck? I hadn’t tried the 2006 Dom Perignon so maybe we try that too while we’re still on the ground… so we can compare?

It was just then that I noticed we weren’t going to be alone on this segment, one other passenger joined us for the flight to Sydney so we’d be occupying 3 of 12 seats in the cabin for the flight. I hopped on my phone to check loads for our onward flight to Paris in a couple of days and held out hope that we’d have that cabin alone to ourselves.

Another flight attendant came around and distributed menus for our 7 hour flight to Singapore.

Pajamas and amenity kits were distributed as well. I especially like the full-sized amenities Singapore offers.

I had already pre-ordered my entrees. Singapore offers an incredible ‘Book the Cook’ service with a wide varity of choices and you can pick what you’re going to want to eat on the flight. It’s not like ordering a meal on American Airlines where they give you a choice of what they’re going to have onboard anyway (or fruit and cheese). Instead it’s a list of choices and they’ll board it for you.

The challenge choosing is always that there are so many options, and it’s hard to know what your future self is going to want to eat. And you’ll rarely go wrong with the onboard options.

But I didn’t have to worry about what to choose for this flight. Instead I put my energy into the wine. While we pushed back and taxiied out for takeoff I decided to peruse the wine and beverage list.

That’s quite a list! A nice bottle of Macallan, Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee (make note of that, definitely going to want that later in the flight!), and I made note of a couple $100 French reds. But departing Australia I was most interested in giving the Penfolds RWT Shiraz a try even though it would be really tight, way too young, and with perhaps not enough time in the flight to let it open.

Up in the air I changed into my pajamas to get comfortable for the flight. Singapore’s A380 have oversized lavatories but they aren’t huge, they are stylish though with great lighting.

They also have several additional drawers of amenities in the lav. In business class there’s no amenity kit usually, just amenities in the lavatory. In first class there’s both.

Back at my seat they brought me a glass of the Penfolds RWT Shiraz. The flight was a bit bumpy which was good, it would do the job of swirling for me. And I readied for the meal, beginning with Singapore’s caviar service.

Out of Singapore I’ll always take Singaporean or Malay options, but out of Syndey I opted for the pre-order lobster… which is often (though not always) good but fairly anodyne.

The orange cake with almond ice cream for dessert was really out of this world.

I didn’t take a glass of wine with it, they offered port but I think I would have enjoyed a sauternes to accompany the orange cake.

After the meal I had a flight attendant make my bed. Normally in an almost empty cabin I’d have them make my bed in another seat, but my wife wasn’t going to nap and I decided to remain next to her so I had them change my current seat into a bed.

Singapore Airlines’ current business and first class ‘flip over’ to become a bed rather than reclining into them. Earlier versions of the seat didn’t have very much recline, and you can’t really convert to the bed yourself you need a flight attendant to do it for you. The tradeoff being they really do get you a better bed. Later versions of the seat were given additional recline. And the newest version of business class does recline into a bed, while the new suites will have a separate bed entirely.

Singapore – Sydney really is too short a flight when you’re in Singapore Suites. By the time you eat a meal, drink a bit of wine, have a short nap, the flight is almost over. I don’t often say this, at least I haven’t said this on a flight that I can think of in several years, but I wasn’t anxious at all for things to end. That’s ok, I’d have a longer flight coming up.

I did doze off for a bit, got up since I wanted to go right to sleep in Singapore when I arrived, I didn’t want to let myself sleep through the flight.

I watched a bit of television, had another glass of Shiraz (I couldn’t bear to have had them open it just for one glass), and soon we were on the ground in Singapore.

Once you arrive in terminal 3 you’re perfectly set up for connections, there’s no transit security to go through since security is at each gate. You can head to lounges or if arriving in Singapore right to immigration. That’s what we did, spent a couple of days in the city mostly eating street food at hawker centers and egg tarts at bake shops.

Arriving back at the airport you cut off to the left just before the main terminal for first class check-in, where they offer a seated check-in experience right in front of immigration and an escalator up to the lounge complex.

I’ll write separately about the Singapore Airlines Private Room, a lounge within a lounge within a lounge for first class passengers. Suffice to say it’s great for food but little else, I don’t find it especially comfortable or interesting otherwise and isn’t in my top 10 worldwide.

Soon enough it was time to board another A380 in Suites Class to head to Paris. And this time crossing my fingers, toes, and anything else I could find paid off because we’d be the only ones in the Suites cabin meant for 12.

Security at the gate was quick, as it always is, they’re only processing people for your flight and turning up just before boarding nearly everyone else has already gone through. I love this arrangement, you can see the boarding queue and if the flight is nearly boarded when you’re going through security they can see you, too.

It’s one of the things that disappoints me in the new Singapore Changi Airport terminal 4, that they’ve gone to central security. Fly Singapore though and you get this arrangement which I find much more civilized.

Once onboard I started with the 2006 Dom Perignon, and then perused the menu.

More pajamas, another amenity kit, headphones distributed, and our midnight flight to Paris was pushing back. An archetypal A380 takeoff, smooth as silk but almost feeling underpowered as she lifts off, and we were up in the air.

With only us to serve, crew were omnipresent and quick with every request. It was late so I didn’t want any more to drink. I changed into pajamas, decided we’d have our meal. I like this flight for eating and going to sleep.

You leave late in Singapore, so you’re probably pretty tired, and you arrive first thing in the morning. As a result there’s no need to try to limit the sleep you’ll get onboard, and on a 14 hour flight there’s plenty of time for it too so you’re also not stressing to get it quickly.

I had a starter and then I had pre-ordered the laksa which is one of my all-time favorite meals in the sky. It’s a huge dish and I don’t come close to finishing it, even half of it, but it’s delicious onboard.

I didn’t do a dessert but my wife did and it looks excellent.

Then, since we had the whole cabin to ourselves and we both decided to get some sleep, we had flight attendants set up beds for us in suites 2C and D. We were sitting in 3C and D, so we would sit together when we’re awake and sleep beside each other in different seats. That’s truly the perfect arrangement especially since there’s really no “in-between” situation with these seats, you’re sitting up with some recline or in bed mode. Having one of each is perfect, no need to choose!

Singapore’s double beds really are an amazing situation, and I got a few hours of solid rest. My wife got up just a bit before me, and was back in our seats already in the row behind.

I thought about a snack and here this is really the one area where I think Singapore falls down in first class. Their midflight snacks are weak. Fortunately they had boarded one of each entree from the main meal. I had pre-ordered mine. My wife had chosen one. As a result, they had one each of the other options left and I thought that the sushi course would make a nice repast.

The rice was actually a bit cold and hard, so it wasn’t perfect, but still a nice snack.

With about 7 hours to go I watched TV and read comfortably in my suite. Then a couple of hours out for my last meal I went with the fruit and I had pre-ordered the Kyo-Kaiseki meal figuring this would be something different and worth a try. It was excellent and also appropriately light.

Boy that was a quick 14 hours! With a suite for eating and entertainment, separate suites with double beds for sleeping, and a Singapore Airlines crew all to myself the time flew by. After breakfast I changed back into my street clothes for landing in Paris. We pulled up a few minutes early, just ahead of a bunch of other flights, so while it was a long walk (and a bit of a dash) to immigration, with priority cards and being ahead of others meant we were through fairly quickly.

And over the course of my 3 days in Paris I kept thinking about how, after flying Singapore Suites as my own private jet, my flight back home across the Pond would be in American Airlines business…"
Why The Airbus A350 Is The Best Plane For Passengers... - God Save The Points,"Thu, 07 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvZHNhdmV0aGVwb2ludHMuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLWJlc3QtcGxhbmUtZm9yLXBhc3NlbmdlcnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Breath Easy, You Can…

Let’s start this discussion by saying that you’re already very lucky. Durable, composite materials have revolutionized the air travel experience for the better. The reason your ears, nose, eyes, ankles and mind no longer feel as if they are under attack, is thanks to a magical transformation in cabin pressure, humidity and building materials. But despite all enhancements – one aircraft, the Airbus A350 stands above it all.

Highest Pressure

This sounds bad, but it isn’t. The higher the pressure a plane can pump, the more natural (earth like) it feels. The Airbus A350 can take a higher pressure than other aircraft in the sky, up to 6,000 feet of atmospheric pressure – making it the most natural environment for all the ligaments, parts and appendages mentioned above. Less swelling, and other pains. You’ll notice instantly.

Wide, Wide

The direct competitor of the Airbus A350 is the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. While both are fantastic aircraft, the A350 exceeds the 787 in width. This allows for more spacious seats in the economy cabin, and also in first and business class cabins. More space, higher ceilings less problems.

Blinds

In the art of politics and business you may have heard of the “double blind”, where the are two layers of maneuver in play. The A350 is very similar. The A350 features a sheer curtain, which provides a lovely soft lighting to cabins – but also has a full “black out” blind capability. It’s direct competitor has nifty dimming windows, which are more fun to watch, but it’s hard to argue with these.

Humidity

People think of humidity as a bad thing – until they get onto airplanes. The reason most people get sick after air travel is due to the dryness of a cabin making their throat and nose raw, exposed to the bad stuff. The A350, thanks to it’s pressure capabilities is able to keep a higher cabin humidity, 5% better than competitors. This feels far more like something pleasant down on earth than any other airplane.

Noise

The first thing you’ll notice (after reading this) is that the Airbus A350 is whisper quiet, beaten only by the A380 in this department. Even during take off, much like it’s predecessor the A380 – you can hold standard voice conversations. No voice raising needed, these carbon planes are the ultimate for business or personal chats. Of course, if you want to hear nothing – you can just buy some great noise cancelling headphones.

Wicked Wifi

This is not an across the board fact, but in general A350’ are newer aircraft than 787’s. More A350’s have been outfitted with state of the art wifi than 787’s giving a competitive advantage to those in need of fast service. This is entirely subjective, and determined by airline (and not plane manufacturer) but with wifi, in general, the newer the better."

Airbus Draws Christmas Tree in Skies Over Germany - Big Think,"Thu, 14 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vYmlndGhpbmsuY29tL3N0cmFuZ2UtbWFwcy9haXJidXMtZHJhd3MtY2hyaXN0bWFzLXRyZWUtaW4tc2tpZXMtb3Zlci1nZXJtYW55L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Making the most of a test flight over Germany and Denmark earlier this week, an Airbus A380 drew a giant Christmas tree on the map – ornaments included.

The five and a half hour flight started and ended at Hamburg Finkenwerder airport. The A380 flew in a straight line towards the southwest, making a loop just south of Bremen.

After a zig in easterly direction and a zag to resume its southwesterly course, another loop produced another bauble. At Cologne, the plane took a nice round bend towards the northeast, produced another ornament, looped back in southwesterly direction, performed another loop, and so on.

The base of the tree is a line running from Karlsruhe to the east. After zig-zagging past Brunswick and Wolfsburg, the plane set course back for Hamburg, only to continue north towards Denmark.

Its long straight trajectory ended over Aalborg, where the plane made a few more loops to finish off the tree-topper, after which the plane returned to Hamburg.

The giant Christmas tree over Germany and Denmark was not the result of a rogue pilot’s actions (like the giant penis that recently appeared over the U.S.), but was an intentional season’s greeting by Airbus to planespotters everywhere.

“This was a standard test flight for internal purposes at Airbus, prior to our delivery of a new aircraft to one of our customers. Its curious pattern was made possible thanks to the friendly and cooperative spirit of Deutsche Flugsicherung (the company in charge of air traffic control for Germany) and Eurocontrol (the international organisation monitoring air traffic management across Europe)”.

Marignane, The Mexican Navy has received its final two AS565 MBe Panther helicopters during a delivery ceremony at Airbus Helicopters in Marignane. With their order for ten units in 2014, the Mexican Navy became the launch customer of this new version. The first four helicopters were delivered in 2016 and the remaining six during the course of 2017.

Stationed at three naval bases in the Mexican states of Veracruz, Sonora and Michoacan, the helicopters perform an average of 300 flight hours for reconnaissance, patrol missions and training flights.

“The arrival of the MBe Panther has enhanced the Navy Aviation’s operational capabilities,” explained Admiral Jose Maria Garcia Macedo, the Mexican Navy’s General Director of Naval Aviation. “It is a modern, multi-mission helicopter that we can use in both maritime and land environments for a wide range of missions, including maritime SAR, disaster relief, external load operations and even air ambulance.”

To carry out such a range of missions, the MBe Panther makes use of advanced mission equipment that includes a cargo hook, a rescue hoist, forward-looking infrared (FLIR) for night-time rescue missions and a total of four stretchers for medical evacuation.

“I would like to thank the Mexican Navy for their confidence in our helicopters,” said Mesrob Karalekian, Airbus Helicopters’ Vice-President for Latin America. “To help ensure success for their critical missions, we have made a technical and logistical support team available to them around the clock in Veracruz. Some 30 pilots have also been trained, many of them receiving specific training in SAR and night vision goggles (NVG).”

The AS565 MBe combines new and proven technologies to offer more value to operators. It is equipped with two Safran Arriel 2N engines, which enhance its performance in hot & high conditions and enable it to achieve a top speed of 278 km/h and a range of 780 kilometers. It also boasts a new main gearbox, a latest-generation tail rotor and a 4-axis autopilot that reduces crew workload and makes the most demanding missions, such as SAR, easier to perform. More powerful and efficient, the AS565 MBe is also safer, more cost-effective and easier to operate.

Airbus today delivered the first “New Singapore Airlines A380” with an upgraded and improved cabin that elevates the passenger experience to new heights – the result of four years of development and a significant investment by the airline.

The milestone delivery involves the first of five new double-deck Airbus A380s that Singapore Airlines is adding to its fleet, and the $850 million spent by the carrier in developing the new cabin clearly underscores the airline’s ongoing and full commitment to Airbus’ flagship jetliner.

“We are proud to deliver the first of five new A380s for Singapore Airlines,” said Airbus Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders, who noted that Singapore Airlines was the first to fly the A380, and has operated the aircraft with the highest levels of technical excellence from its service entry. “The aircraft has proven to be a huge commercial success in service with the carrier, flying passengers efficiently and in comfort on the airline’s long haul and regional network.”

In addition to its five new aircraft, Singapore Airlines also will retrofit the new cabin on 14 of its A380s already in service. The retrofit programme will begin at the end of 2018, to be undertaken by the airline in conjunction with Services by Airbus – the Airbus operation created to deliver world-leading integrated aviation services. All 14 Singapore Airlines A380s will be retrofitted by 2020.

Improvements throughout

The New Singapore Airlines A380 features six private Suites on the forward upper deck with a swivelling recliner, an office area and a bed; 78 newly designed Business Class seats on the upper deck; and on the main deck, 44 Premium Economy Class and 343 Economy Class seats. Throughout, the iconic aircraft offers the latest in-flight entertainment systems and full connectivity from every seat.

The redesigned Suites allow passengers to lounge comfortably in the chair or rest in bed without the need to convert the bed from a sitting position. Business Class seats offer more under-seat stowage space, measure a spacious 25 inches in width and recline into a 78-inch full-flat bed.

The leather-finished seats in Premium Economy Class are 19.5 inches wide, offer a calf-rest and foot-bar, individual in-seat power, and more stowage space under the seat. Economy Class seats offer wider-than-average 18.5-inch seats, an improved design that provides additional back support, a six-way adjustable headrest with foldable wings and an ergonomically-designed footrest with adjustable positions.

Following an MOU signed at Le Bourget Paris Airshow in June, Viva Air, the Latin America low cost carrier group owned by Irelandia Aviation, has signed a purchase agreement with Airbus for 50 A320 Family aircraft. The 35 A320neo and 15 A320ceo will be operated by the group’s airlines VivaColombia and Viva Air Peru and will allow the two all-Airbus operators to modernize their fleets and capture growth opportunities across Latin America.

William Shaw, CEO and Founder of VivaColombia, part of Viva Air, said: “This order reflects our long-term commitment to our customers lowering fares further due to the benefits of this new fleet. We are excited to continue expanding our successful low cost model and accelerate our growth throughout Latin America making air transportation more accessible and affordable to our customers.”



John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer, Customers, said: “Airbus is pleased to play a major role in supporting Viva Air in its exciting journey to develop the low cost model throughout Latin America. With its exceptionally comfortable cabin, low operating costs and excellent fuel efficiency, the A320 and A320neo Families are the best product lines to complement Viva Air’s expansion goals.”



The Airbus-VivaColombia relationship began in 2012 when the airline began operations with A320 aircraft. VivaColombia, based in Medellin, has been an all-Airbus operator since, and today it operates 11 A320s. Viva Air recently launched Viva Air Peru, the sister airline of VivaColombia based in Lima. Viva Air Peru currently operates three A320 aircraft.



Viva Air is a Panamanian headquartered group created by Irelandia Aviation and led by Declan Ryan. Irelandia has successfully developed six low cost carriers around the world, namely Allegiant, Ryanair, Tigerair, VivaAerobus, VivaColombia and most recently Viva Air Peru. Combined, the airlines have a fleet of more than 420 aircraft and have carried over a billion passengers.



The A320 Family is the world’s best-selling single aisle product line. To date, the Family has won over 13,000 orders and more than 7,600 aircraft have been delivered to some 400 customers and operators worldwide.



The A320neo Family incorporates the very latest technologies including new generation engines and Sharklets, which together deliver at least 15 percent fuel savings at delivery and 20 percent by 2020. With more than 5200 orders received from 95 customers since its launch in 2010, the A320neo Family has captured some 60 percent share of the market.



With over 1,000 aircraft sold and a backlog of over 400, more than 650 Airbus aircraft are in operation throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. Since 1990, Airbus has secured over 60 percent of net orders in the region and in the past 10 years alone, Airbus has tripled its in-service fleet.

Delta Places Order for 100 Airbus A321neo Aircraft - The Points Guy,"Thu, 14 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS8yMDE3LzEyL2RlbHRhLXBsYWNlcy1haXJidXMtYTMyMW5lby1vcmRlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Daily Newsletter Reward your inbox with the TPG Daily newsletter Join over 700,000 readers for breaking news, in-depth guides and exclusive deals from TPG’s experts Email address Sign up By signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy .

Delta Air Lines announced Thursday an order for 100 Airbus A321neo aircraft, a deal valued at $12.7 billion. The addition of these aircraft, which will be delivered beginning in 2020 until 2023, will continue a recent trend of the Atlanta-based carrier ordering Airbus aircraft including the A350, A321 and A330. The carrier recently took delivery of its first A350s, which are taking their place as the flagship aircraft in Delta's fleet with the retirement of the 747.

In the announcement, Delta confirmed that it's agreed with Airbus for a 100 firm and 100 option A321neo order with Pratt & Whitney geared-turbofan engines. The carrier will configure the A321neo with a total of 197 seats — 20 in first class, 30 in Comfort+ and 147 in the main cabin. As compared to its existing A321 fleet, the A321neo will have an additional five seats. The aircraft will be equipped with in-flight entertainment, satellite-based 2Ku Wi-Fi and power ports.

Delta already operates several variants of the A320 family including the A319-100 and A320-200 it inherited from Northwest and the A321-200 it bought after the merger with NW. It currently has 30 of the latter, with another 92 on order. The order for the A321neo presents many opportunities for the airline — the aircraft is versatile and can perform a number of duties, including premium transcontinental routes, which is what American Airlines does with some of its A321s, configured in four classes with just 102 seats. A321s typically seat about twice that number.

Delta's large Airbus order comes amid an ongoing spat between the US and Canada over the Bombardier CS jet, which Delta has bought, too, with an order for 75. Boeing complained to the US Department of Commerce that the Canadian manufacturer was competing unfairly with its 737 by pricing the CS artificially low thanks to government subsidies. The US government sided with Boeing, slapping a 300% tariff on the price of the Canadian aircraft, but Delta was defiant and said that it wouldn't pay the premium for the aircraft. Following news of the tariff, Airbus announced that it would buy a 50.01% stake in the CSeries program and would produce a number of CSeries aircraft at its plant in Alabama, which would allow Delta to skirt the tariff.

While the fate of Delta's CSeries aircraft is uncertain, it seems that the airline is sending a message to Boeing by choosing the A321neo over Boeing's competing aircraft, the 737 MAX. Additionally, in a move linked to the trade dispute, the Canadian government announced on Tuesday that it was canceling an order for US-made F-18 Super Hornet military aircraft, choosing instead to buy used F-18s from Australia."
First Tiger HAD retrofit delivered to the French Army Aviation - Airbus,"Thu, 21 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0xMi1maXJzdC10aWdlci1oYWQtcmV0cm9maXQtZGVsaXZlcmVkLXRvLXRoZS1mcmVuY2gtYXJteS1hdmlhdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Marignane, Airbus Helicopters has delivered the first Tiger retrofitted into the HAD version to the French Army Aviation, after having previously completed its formal acceptance process with the French Defence Procurement Agency (DGA).

This retrofit from the HAP to the HAD version involves performing over 100 airframe modifications and installing over 1500 new parts and 250 electrical cables.

Compared with the previous HAP version, the HAD Tiger benefits from an increased maximum take-off weight (MTOW), and is equipped with two new enhanced MTR 390 E engines and with a new STRIX roof mounted sight system complete with a laser designator that allows the Hellfire II air-to-ground missile to be fired.

This retrofit is the first of 36 retrofits from HAP to HAD ordered by the French Ministry of Defence.

For this Tiger retrofit program, Airbus Helicopters has set up a new industrial organization, combining both teams from its Military Support Center France and from its Tiger serial production Final Assembly Line.

“This retrofit is considered a priority for the French Army and will allow us to have a perfected weapon system and a homogenous fleet. The first HAD Tigers have been combat-proven since 2014 and have shown their wide range of capabilities daily in demanding theatres of operation” said the French Army Aviation Command.

“We are pleased to have achieved this first delivery in accordance with the specifications of our customer” said Alexandra Cros, head of governmental affairs France at Airbus Helicopters. “This Tiger retrofit program will give the French Army Aviation the additional capabilities they require in order to perform their most demanding operational missions”, she added.

The Tiger HAD is Airbus Helicopters’ multi-role attack helicopter. It is designed to perform armed reconnaissance, air or ground escort, air-to-air combat, ground firing support, destruction and anti-tank warfare, day or night and in adverse conditions.

The Tiger attack helicopter has proven its capabilities during operational deployments in Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, Libya and Mali. In service with the armed forces of France, Germany, Spain and Australia, the global Tiger fleet has logged over 92,000 flight hours to date.

Airbus Helicopters and UK Ministry of Defence sign Follow-on Support Arrangement for RAF Puma Mk2 - Airbus,"Fri, 22 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0xMi1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtYW5kLXVrLW1pbmlzdHJ5LW9mLWRlZmVuY2Utc2lnbi1mb2xsb3ctb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Oxford, Airbus Helicopters and the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) have signed a Follow-on Support Arrangement contract to provide support to the Royal Air Force Puma 2 fleet over the planned service life of the aircraft. The contract, worth an initial £100 million, is the first of two pricing periods which will see Airbus Helicopters provide full technical support and logistics until March 2022. The contract has the facility to be extended until the currently planned out of service date March 2025, subject to the agreement of both parties.

As part of the company’s support offering, Airbus Helicopters will provide repair and overhaul services in addition to a parts-by-the-hour programme, helping to ensure high availability with stable, value for money maintenance costs. The contract also includes the provision of training to all Puma avionics and mechanical technicians as well as engineering managers.

Defence Minister Harriett Baldwin said, “This £100 million investment will ensure our Puma helicopters continue to transport British troops and kit to the front line – helping us provide vital support quickly in rapidly evolving situations. The deal - part of our £178 billion Equipment Plan - will not only give our Armed Forces the kit they need to deal with intensifying global threats, but will also sustain British jobs at Airbus Helicopters.”

The contract, awarded under single-source regulations, follows on from the previous very successful Interim Support Arrangement, which has seen Airbus Helicopters support the aircraft since the first upgraded Puma 2 entered service in 2012, recently reaching 20,000 flight hours.

Ian Morris, Head of UK defence programmes at Airbus Helicopters, said, “This follow on contract re-affirms the confidence that the MoD has in the aircraft and in Airbus to continue to provide a cost effective and highly capable solution that will allow the Puma to continue to support our forces on operations, in very demanding conditions.”

From the outset, Puma 2 has delivered the UK Armed Forces a significant capability which has been exploited during its very successful, and ongoing, deployment to Afghanistan under Operation TORAL. More recently, during the UK’s disaster relief Operation RUMAN in the wake of Hurricane Irma, the Puma demonstrated another of its strengths as an ideal support helicopter capable of rapid deployment by C17, with minimal build up required on arrival prior to starting operations making it a clear choice for contingency operations world-wide.

Madrid, 21 December 2017 - An Airbus A400M has successfully refuelled six Spanish Air Force F-18 fighters in a single mission as part of an air-to-air refuelling (AAR) human factors certification flight. The 13 December mission featured a complex series of AAR scenarios such as changes of area, receivers with unknown priorities, and unexpected increases in numbers of receivers. Through multiple contacts the six aircraft simulated a fleet of eight.

The F-18s included the first Spanish operational fighters to be refuelled by the A400M and belonged to the Spanish Air Force Test Centre (CLAEX) and the 12th Operational Wing based at Torrejón.

A total of 11.4 tonnes of fuel was dispensed using both the underwing pods and the centre hose refuelling unit. Certification authorities on board confirmed good results and the flight validated the A400M two-crew cockpit concept for tanker missions.

The companies said in joint statements that AerCap had exercised an option to buy the 50 planes, with deliveries starting from 2022.

Airbus and Boeing are pairing with smaller regional rivals to add sales at the lower end of their $100 billion-a-year commercial plane duopoly, but the two market leaders are also laying the foundation for a longer-term strategic contest against more powerful threats such as China.

The airline has options for up to 100 additional jets, Delta said, ahead of its investor day presentation.

It is also a win for United Technologies unit Pratt & Whitney as the carrier had selected the engine maker to power its new planes.

""This is the right transaction at the right time for our customers, our employees and our shareholders,"" said Delta CEO Ed Bastian.

The airline said it will start taking deliveries of the plane in 2020.

The Airbus deal is a loss for rival airplane maker Boeing whose new 737 planes compete with the European plane makers' model.

A Boeing spokesman said, ""Delta remains a valued customer, and we'll continue exploring ways to best meet their needs in the future.""

Boeing ""competed with a strong but disciplined offer in the Delta campaign,"" Doug Alder said. ""While Delta has chosen to go with Airbus and Bombardier in recent single aisle campaigns, we are proud of the 737 MAX family's superior value and performance.""

The decision on the Airbus planes, which was reported Wednesday, comes as Delta is in the middle of a snowballing trade dispute between Boeing and Canadian plane maker Bombardier , which Boeing alleges sold planes to Delta below the cost of production and received unfair government subsidies.

The U.S. Commerce Department recommended a 300 percent duty on those Bombardier jets earlier this year. Delta has repeatedly said it does not plan to pay those proposed tariffs. In a surprise move, Airbus, Boeing's archrival, swooped in to take a majority stake in the contested Bombardier C-Series jet program in October."

Delta Air Lines announced on Dec. 14 that it has ordered 100 Airbus planes with an option to buy 100 more, in a blow to Airbus’ American rival Boeing.

Delta said it was buying the A321neo aircraft to renew its narrow-body fleet, which have 197 seats and are used for domestic or short international flights.

The Airbus order comes amid public friction between Delta and US giant Boeing over a trade dispute involving a separate Delta deal to buy planes from Canadian company Bombardier.

Airbus deliveries to Delta will begin in 2020 and go through 2023 under the order, worth an estimated $12.7 billion based on the aircraft catalogue price.

Delta said in an investor presentation that the new planes would result in 40 percent fuel savings compared with the jet they are replacing.

“This is the right transaction at the right time for our customers, our employees and our shareholders,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a statement.

Airbus in 2015 opened a manufacturing plant in Mobile, Alabama to build single-aisle planes with an eye towards competing more aggressively in the U.S. market.

Toulouse, France-based Airbus highlighted its growing connection to the U.S. in the announcement, saying most of the new planes would be delivered from Mobile.

“This purchase furthers our commitment to U.S. aviation - a commitment that has never been stronger,” said John Leahy, chief operating officer for customers at Airbus Commercial Aircraft.

“Today, there is more U.S. content in Airbus aircraft than from any other country, with more than 40 percent of our aircraft-related procurement coming from the United States.”"

A decade later, the Singapore Airlines A380, featuring our flagship products and legendary service, remains a customer favourite, and we continue to receive highly positive feedback about the travel experience on the aircraft.”



“We are proud to deliver the first of five new A380s to Singapore Airlines featuring the carrier's beautiful new cabin design,” said Tom Enders, Airbus Chief Executive Officer. “Singapore Airlines was the first to fly the A380 and has operated the aircraft with the highest levels of technical excellence since day one. The aircraft has proven to be a huge commercial success in service with the carrier, flying passengers efficiently and in comfort on the airline’s long haul and regional network.”



“We thank Singapore Airlines for its ongoing strong commitment to the A380 programme and look forward to working together with the carrier as it renews and refreshes its fleet.”



Capable of flying up to 8,200 nautical miles non-stop, the A380 is the world’s largest and most spacious airliner and offers the most efficient solution to meet growth in passenger traffic on the world’s most heavily travelled routes. The A380 is the only aircraft with two full decks, featuring wider seats, broader aisles, and more floor space. Today the A380 is flying with 13 world class airlines on 120 routes around the globe. Since entry-into-service in 2007 the A380 world fleet has carried over 190 million passengers.

The airline giant chose to order 100 Airbus (NASDAQOTH: EADSY) A321neos with an additional 100 options, spurning the competing Boeing (NYSE: BA) 737 MAX 10.

This outcome confirmed reports that had leaked out the day before but went against what many outsiders (including myself) had been expecting. The desperation of engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney -- a unit of United Technologies (NYSE: UTX) -- appears to have been a critical factor behind Delta's decision.

Airbus wins the contest

Earlier this year, many pundits assumed that the competition between Airbus and Boeing for the next Delta narrowbody order wouldn't be all that competitive. Delta Air Lines and Boeing have had an acrimonious relationship in recent years, culminating in a trade complaint from Boeing after Delta ordered 75 CSeries jets from Bombardier last year.

Nevertheless, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian insisted repeatedly that this spat wouldn't affect the carrier's decision. In fact, United Continental executive Scott Kirby stated earlier this year that Airbus was unable to provide competitive pricing on the A321neo because of a ""most-favored customer"" clause it had offered American Airlines. This situation appeared to give Boeing a decisive advantage.

In any case, Airbus ended up winning the order. Delta will receive its first A321neo in early 2020, and all of the firm orders will be delivered by the end of 2023. This situation will allow Delta to continue replacing its oldest planes. The A321neo will provide a stunning 40% fuel efficiency improvement compared with Delta's MD-88s, according to the airline.

Thanks to Airbus' innovative cabin design, Delta Air Lines will be able to fit 197 seats on its A321neos -- five additional seats compared with its fleet of current-generation A321s. The Boeing 737 MAX 10 may not have been able to accommodate that many seats in Delta's preferred configuration. However, Delta's decision may have been driven far more by a sweetheart engine deal than by anything inherent in the A321neo design.

Story continues

This deal was more about engines than airplanes

Delta Air Lines' A321neos will be powered by next-generation Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan (GTF) engines. The CSeries planes that Delta ordered last year use a similar GTF engine from the United Technologies subsidiary.

Delta has also ordered CSeries jets with Pratt & Whitney engines. Image source: Delta Air Lines.

While the new GTF engines are delivering huge fuel savings for airlines, Pratt & Whitney has been plagued by significant production delays and reliability issues. As a result, through the first eight months of 2017, A320neo buyers opted for the competing CFM LEAP engine over Pratt & Whitney's GTF offering by a 10-to-1 margin. As a result, Pratt & Whitney was desperate to get Delta's business.

To help seal the deal, United Technologies agreed to make Delta's in-house maintenance, repair, and overhaul unit a major repair shop for its GTF engines. While Pratt & Whitney didn't give Delta TechOps exclusivity as a maintenance provider, it guaranteed that Delta TechOps will perform more than 5,000 engine repairs and overhauls.

Engine manufacturers get the bulk of their earnings from service agreements. By agreeing to farm out work to Delta TechOps, United Technologies is probably giving up a substantial amount of future profits.

Clearly, CFM -- a joint venture between General Electric and Safran -- saw no need to offer similar terms. Since CFM is the exclusive engine provider for Boeing's 737 MAX family, Pratt & Whitney's desperation for a win gave the A321neo a crucial edge.

Boeing is still in good shape

It would be natural to see Delta's decision as a huge win for Airbus and a huge loss for Boeing. However, Boeing has had no trouble finding new customers for its 737 MAX jets this year. The 737 family has a backlog of nearly 4,500 firm orders, so the Delta Air Lines deal was hardly a ""must-win"" situation.

Clearly, Pratt & Whitney can't award every potential customer a huge engine services deal to beat out CFM. Thus, pundits shouldn't read too much into Delta's decision to buy the A321neo rather than the 737 MAX 10. The two planes offer very similar economics for airlines, so investors should expect to see a healthy rivalry between them in the coming years.

“The E-Fan X is an important next step in our goal of making electric flight a reality in the foreseeable future. The lessons we learned from a long history of electric flight demonstrators, starting with the Cri-Cri, including the e-Genius, E-Star, and culminating most recently with the E-Fan 1.2, as well as the fruits of the E-Aircraft Systems House collaboration with Siemens, will pave the way to a hybrid single-aisle commercial aircraft that is safe, efficient, and cost-effective,” said Paul Eremenko, Airbus’ Chief Technology Officer. “We see hybrid-electric propulsion as a compelling technology for the future of aviation.”

Airbus, Rolls-Royce and Siemens will each play a specific role in the development of the E-Fan X technology. Airbus

The ground test will begin with a British Aerospace 146 flying testbed; however, a two-megawatt electric motor will replace one of the aircraft’s four gas turbine engines. As testing progresses, a second electric motor will replace another gas turbine engine. Ultimately, the companies believe the E-Fan X program could pave the way for safe and reliable hybrid electric technology, while also serving as a training platform for a new generation of designers and engineers.

Each company plays a specific role in the development of the demonstrator, as Airbus will handle the “overall integration” and Rolls-Royce will be responsible for the turbo-shaft engine, two megawatt generator, and power electronics, according to a joint statement. Siemens, which previously announced an E-Aircraft Systems House collaboration with Airbus in 2016, is providing the two megawatt electric motors and their power electronic control unit, among other power aspects.

“Siemens has been driving innovation in core technology fields at full speed,” said Roland Busch, Chief Technology Officer of Siemens. “In April 2016 we opened a new chapter in electric-mobility with the collaboration with Airbus. Building up electric propulsion for aircraft, we are creating new perspectives for our company and also for our customers and society. With the E-Fan X partnership, we now take the next step to demonstrate the technology in the air.”"

PARIS (AP) - Airbus said Friday that its CEO, Tom Enders, will step down in 2019, as the European airplane maker shakes up management amid multiple corruption investigations.

The company said Enders, who will have been at the helm of Airbus and defense firm EADS for 14 years, won't seek another term when his current term expires.

Enders has been a key figure as Airbus has jockeyed with U.S. rival Boeing over the past decade to be the world's top-selling plane maker.

The 59-year-old was quoted Friday as saying Airbus needs ""fresh minds for the 2020s"" and that he would use the remainder of his time to ensure a smooth transition and to strengthen the company's ethics and compliance programs.

Also leaving is the chief operating officer and president of the commercial aircraft division, Fabrice Bregier, who will step down next February.

He will be succeeded by Guillaume Faury, currently CEO of Airbus Helicopters. Enders described Faury as part of ""the next generation of leaders,"" which could suggest he is being groomed to eventually take over as CEO of the overall Airbus Group.

The announcement came weeks after Airbus announced it is replacing its combative, long-serving sales chief, John Leahy. He's being replaced by an outside executive, from Rolls Royce.

The big challenge for incoming Airbus management will be legal investigations.

Authorities in Britain and France are investigating alleged fraud and bribery related to Airbus' use of outside consultants in commercial plane sales. Airbus has warned that the investigations could lead to ""significant penalties"" and promised to stop working with middlemen.

Meanwhile, Austria is investigating suspected fraud in the government's purchase of Airbus combat aircraft.

It's a bumpy time for Airbus, which recently saw a major deal with Gulf carrier Emirates for A380 superjumbos fall apart at the last minute at the Dubai Air Show. The airline handed the contract to Boeing instead.

Shares were little changed Friday, as management changes were expected.

Airbus had revenues of 67 billion euros ($79 billion) last year and employs 134,000 staff worldwide.

The deal includes 100 firm aircraft and another 100 options with deliveries from 2020 to 2023, the Atlanta-based carrier says today.

Delta has selected Pratt & Whitney PW1100G engines for the A321neos.

""This is the right transaction at the right time for our customers, our employees and our shareholders,” says Ed Bastian, chief executive of Delta, in a statement.

The order is worth roughly $25.4 billion at list prices, Airbus' website shows.

The A321neos, which Delta will configure with 197 seats, will replace ageing narrowbodies in the airline's fleet, including the Airbus A320, Boeing 757-200 and MD-90.

Delta operates 64 A320s with an average age of 22.2 years, 111 757-200s with an average age of 22.5 years and 62 Boeing MD-90s with an average age of 20.6 years, Flight Fleets Analyzer shows.

The carrier first disclosed plans for a significant A320neo family or Boeing 737 Max family order in October. At the time, chief executive Ed Bastian called it one of the largest request for proposals underway in the market.

Analysts and reports forecast an order for the Airbus narrowbody over the 737 Max. They cited a number of factors, including the trade dispute between Boeing and Bombardier over Delta's order for 75 CS100s in 2016, and an A321neo configuration more suited to the airline's needs.

""We'll look at both aircraft on their merits and ultimately make a decision accordingly,"" said Gil West, chief operating officer of Delta, in October on the evaluation process.

Prior to the A321neo order, the carrier had ordered 142 Airbus aircraft - including 92 A321s - 20 Boeing aircraft and 75 Bombardier aircraft since 2014, Fleets Analyzer shows.

As Delta Air Lines phases out its remaining 747s which it inherited after merging with Northwest Airlines in 2010, the airline has been hard at work welcoming its newest flagship: the Airbus A350-900, into its network. After being the first U.S. carrier to take delivery of the new airplane in July. The airline has already taken delivery of five A350-900XWBs.

Beginning on July 2, 2018, Delta will use the Airbus A350 on alternating days for its daily flights between Los Angeles (LAX) and Shanghai (PVG). On July 18, the A350 will permanently be assigned to the route.

The aircraft will replace the Boeing 777-200LR which currently operates Delta flight 89 and 88 to and from Shanghai. The aircraft is scheduled to spend 20 plus hours in Los Angeles between flights, which may be a hint towards the airline potentially adding more A350 from its growing LAX hub in the future.

By adding the A350 on its flights to Shanghai, there is a net gain of 15 additional seats due to the 777 having 291 total seats, compared to the A350’s 306 seats. The A350 has eight additional seats in economy, 11 new economy plus seats, and 4 fewer seats in Delta One.

Potentially the biggest change with the A350 on the route is the introduction of the new Delta One cabin, which made its debut earlier this year on the airline’s first A350. The airline’s new business class product, which has already won a Crystal Cabin Award, will be available on this flight.

So far, Delta Air Lines has announced seven routes for the aircraft. From Detroit, the airplane is already flying to Tokyo (NRT) and Seoul (ICN), replacing the 747 which previously operated both of these flights. The A350 will also fly to Beijing (PEK) beginning in January and to Shanghai from April of next year, making Shanghai the first city with two scheduled Delta A350 flights after July 2018.

The A350 will also replace an A330 turn to Amsterdam in March, making this the first European destination for Delta’s newest fleet member.

From Delta’s largest hub in Atlanta, the A350 is currently only scheduled to fly to Seoul beginning next March. Similar to United Airlines with its initial 777-300ERs, Delta’s primary goals with its first few A350s is to operate on routes that the 747 did, then add the aircraft to other routes as more are delivered. With over 20 more A350 jets being delivered through 2022, the aircraft is quickly becoming an important part of Delta’s wide-body fleet at multiple hubs across the U.S.

Pegasus Airlines, the leading Low-Cost-Carrier (LCC) in Turkey, has placed an order for 25 A321neo ACF (Airbus Cabin Flex configuration). This comes on top of 18 A321neo and 57 A320neos already on order, bringing Pegasus Airlines’ total firm order to 100 Airbus A320 Family aircraft.



Pegasus’ selection to move to an all-Airbus fleet reflects its strategy to grow its domestic as well as its international network with the best middle-of-the-market aircraft available.



Pegasus Airlines General Manager Mehmet T. Nane: “Turkey keeps strengthening its position in the world aviation market everyday and we as Pegasus are an important part of this transformation. The order we placed in 2012 for 100 Airbus aircraft was the biggest order in Turkey’s aviation history at the time. We received the first aircraft of this order in Q3 2016 and now we have an agreement to convert 25 options into firm orders. We will continue to grow our fleet one step at a time and with our new aircraft we will continue to offer more comfortable flights for our passengers.”



“The latest Pegasus Airlines’ order for the A321neo ACF variant underlines that Airbus offers the best, most efficient and most comfortable solution in the Middle of the Market segment,” said John Leahy, Chief Operating Officer – Customers, Airbus Commercial Aircraft. “Combining latest innovations in cabin design with unprecedented capacity and range capabilities, the A321 ACF will further boost the airline’s passenger experience and competitiveness in the highly contested growth market while reducing its environmental footprint.”



The A321 is the largest member of the A320 Family, seating up to 240 passengers. Incorporating the latest engines, aerodynamic advances, and cabin innovations, the A321neo offers a significant reduction in fuel consumption of at least 15 percent per seat from day one and 20 percent by 2020.

The A321neo ACF introduces new door and fuselage enhancements allowing airlines to make better use of the cabin space and also provide provision for more underfloor fuel capacity for up to a 4,000 nautical mile transatlantic range. With more than 5,200 orders received from 95 customers, the A320neo Family has captured nearly 60 percent share of the market.

Under the contract, the company will provide installation design, integration testing and qualification for the system. This contract follows a successful program of the AeroShield POD with a similar configuration on Boeing 737 type aircraft.

The Aeroshield pod is an all-in-one, integrated Man Portable Anti-Aircraft Missile Systems (MANPADS) threat detection and countermeasure solution that complies with EASA/FAA civil aviation regulation procedures. The system enables the installation of Bird’s Airborne Missile Protection Systems (AMPS) on VIP and commercial aircraft with minimal disruption to operations. the AeroShield POD comprises BIRD’s AMPS system which includes five Missile Launch Detection Sensors (MILDS), one Missile Approach Confirmation Sensor (MACS), Flare Dispensers and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The pod can be transferred between different aircraft.

Bird Aerosystems’ patented MACS sensor performs unique confirmation of suspected incoming missile threats detected by the main electro-optical passive sensors, and practically eliminates any false alarms. Upon receiving a pre-alarm warning from the electro-optical sensors, MACS slews to the direction of the incoming threat and verifies the threat’s validity. Concurrently, MACS also collects relevant information on the target (velocity and distance) and calculates its time-to-

impact, enabling the most effective countermeasure response to the incoming missile. This validation process between the electro-optical sensors and the MACS provides the most effective filtering for all nature and man-made known types of

false alarms that are usually detected by electro-optical sensors. MACS ensures that only real missiles will be declared by the system and reacted upon."

On Wednesday, Airbus took a brand new A380 superjumbo on a test flight over Europe. Instead of charting some arbitrary route, the test pilots decided to deliver some holiday cheer and drew an outline of a Christmas tree in the skies over Germany and Denmark.

The route included detours to draw ornaments and a trip north to Denmark for the tree topper.

The flight, which took five hours and 22 minutes to complete, began and ended at the Airbus facility in Hamburg, Germany.

The A380 used for the flight is expected to be delivered to Emirates in the near future and will be one of the more than 100 Superjumbos in the airline's fleet.

Qatar Airways has re-affirmed its earlier order for 50 A320neo with a firm order for 50 A321neo ACF (Airbus Cabin Flex configuration). The selection of the largest member of Airbus’ single-aisle Family reflects the airline’s need for efficiency and additional capacity. This updated order replaces the original one placed in 2011.

Joining Qatar Airways’ fleet of 50 A320ceo from 2019 onwards, the A321neo ACF will support the continuous development of Qatar Airways’ network, leveraging the A321neo range capability and the unprecedented customer experience. The total value of the deal is $6.35 billion at list prices.

Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, His Excellency Mr. Akbar Al Baker, said: “At a time when Qatar Airways is experiencing unprecedented growth and expansion the need for efficient, reliable and modern aircraft has never been greater. To answer our need for growth and additional capacity, the A321neo ACF is a world-class choice for our passengers and for our business. Qatar Airways is the fastest growing airline in the world and with this aircraft we will operate the youngest fleet whilst delivering unprecedented comfort and services to our customers.”

“We are pleased that a signature airline like Qatar Airways has chosen the A321neo ACF.” said Fabrice Brégier, Airbus Chief Operating Officer and President Commercial Aircraft. “This is an endorsement for the largest member of our single-aisle family. It confirms the aircraft’s strong position as the ideal Middle of the Market airplane for the Middle East. We look forward to seeing the A321neo ACF flying in Qatar Airways colours and to contributing to the airline’s continued success and excellence.”

The A321 is the largest member of the A320 Family, seating up to 240 passengers. Incorporating the latest engines, aerodynamic advances, and cabin innovations, the A321neo offers a significant reduction in fuel consumption of at least 15 percent per seat from day one and 20 percent by 2020.

The A321neo ACF introduces new door and fuselage enhancements allowing airlines to make better use of the cabin space and also provide provision for more underfloor fuel capacity for up to 4,000nm transatlantic range.

The A320neo Family incorporates the very latest technologies including new generation engines and Sharklets, which together deliver at least 15 percent fuel savings at delivery and 20 percent by 2020. With more than 5,200 orders received from 95 customers since its launch in 2010, the A320neo Family has captured some 60 percent share of the market."

Project includes cabin upgrades for 202 A321s

Airbus takes major step into US services market with its largest-ever cabin retrofit contract

American Airlines (AAL) has chosen Services by Airbus to provide cabin upgrades for 202 of its A321s in-service – the largest retrofit project in Airbus history. The airline will be the first retrofit customer for Airbus’ new Airspace XL bins. The larger bins provide a 40 percent increase in storage space for carry-on bags, reducing bin crowding and the need to check bags at the gate, allowing a more relaxed boarding experience to both passengers and cabin crews.

“Thanks to this Airbus cabin retrofit, passengers on American Airlines’ A321s will be able to board faster and will enjoy an overall improved travel experience,” said Laurent Martinez, Head of Services by Airbus. “This is exactly the type of added-value that our services can bring to airlines. This contract is a major step for Airbus into the US services market, and we are grateful to American Airlines for their trust in our expertise.”

The upgrades are part of a project which will standardise American Airlines’ A321s with a common seat count and interior, providing passengers with a consistent travel experience. New production A321s for American Airlines will also be equipped with Airspace XL bins.

Airbus’ Global Services Forecast projects that over the next 20 years the commercial aircraft upgrades services market will be worth US$180 billion, driven in part by high competition between airlines who value the ‘passenger experience’ as a differentiator (comfort, connectivity, etc.), as well as systems upgrades. Fourteen percent of this demand will come from North America."

“It was the idea of test pilots and engineers,” a spokesperson for the plane manufacturer told the Daily Telegraph, adding that flight test routes were “flexible”.

This isn’t the first time a test crew has got creative with its route, says NPR. In August, a Boeing 787-8 pilot made things meta by plotting a course which drew an outline of the plane itself, stretching from Texas to Michigan.

Creative flight patterns don’t always go down well, however, says the BBC. Last month, a US Navy pilot was “strongly reprimanded for using contrails to trace a penis over the state of Washington”."

According to reports, ALC received its first Airbus A350-900 XWB out of the 29 A350 family aircraft which it had ordered earlier.

Reports also suggest that Malaysia Airlines Berhad would be operating six A350-900s leased from ALC. It will initially commence its operations within Asia, and from the first quarter of 2018, it will fly between Kuala Lumpur and London as part of its premier long haul service.

On its regional and long haul routes, Malaysia Airlines currently operates 24 Airbus aircraft, including six A380s, 15 A330-300s and three A330-200Fs, said sources.

A350-900 leased by the Malaysia Airlines has a three class cabin layout comprising 286 seats with a First Class cabin. It offers four seats in the First Class, 35 seats in the business class and 247 in the economy class. The seats are convertible to fully flat beds.

Fitted with the most modern aerodynamic design, Airbus A350 XWB has carbon fibre fuselage and wings and new fuel-efficient Rolls Royce engines, thereby offering unrivalled levels of spaciousness, better ambience, superior levels of comfort, operational efficiency along with a 25 percent reduction in fuel burn, emission, and notably lower maintenance costs.

Izham Ismail, CEO of Malaysia Airlines said, “We are quite thrilled to add Airbus A350-900 XWB to our family. It’s an important milestone for us as the aircraft will help us boost our competitiveness on our long haul flight routes. Addition of Airbus A350-900 also underscores our commitment to operate a modern fleet.”

“Our first Airbus A350-900 symbolises a milestone for ALC and Malaysia Airlines. We are convinced that Airbus A350-900 will deliver its outstanding performance, efficiency and economics for our airline customers” said John Plueger, CEO and President of Air Lease Corporation.

“At Airbus, we are proud to consider Malaysia Airlines as one of the new operators of the world’s most modern widebody aircraft,’’ said John Leahy, CEO-Customers of Airbus Commercial Aircraft."

The facility spans across 18ha and is designed to produce blades for all range of Airbus helicopters.

Built as part of Airbus’ industrial strategy, the 35,000m² hangar facility will use both automation and cobotisation processes, which enable people and robots to work together, to perform operations.

The Paris-Le Bourget site expects to accommodate more flexible work loads as a result of work-based production rather than product-based production process.

The blade-specific specialisation site currently employs 640 staff, 100 students, interns and temporary workers to produce and repair roughly 4,000 blades a year.



“The Paris-Le Bourget site expects to accommodate more flexible work loads as a result of work-based production rather than product-based production process.”

It relocates Airbus’ activities from La Courneuve site in France and aims to transform its organisation of work, industrial processes, and eventually, the company’s competitiveness.

The Paris-Le Bourget site also intends to reduce production costs and manufacturing cycles for helicopters.

In a separate development, Airbus Helicopters announced that its third H160 prototype has received a fresh coat of paint and features a ‘carbon’ livery in order to join the Airbus A350 XWB MSN2 flight-test aircraft.

The prototype was built using advanced composite materials provided by Airbus partner Hexcel.

The Airbus H160 represents the first civil helicopter featuring a full composite fuselage, which includes a lighter fuel-saving airframe, and offers performance optimisation and easy maintenance."
New C295 Armed Version Unveiled at Dubai Air Show 2017 - Airbus,"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE3LTEyLW5ldy1jMjk1LWFybWVkLXZlcnNpb24tdW52ZWlsZWQtYXQtZHViYWktYWlyLXNob3ctMjAxN9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus DS recently unveiled during Dubai Airshow 2017 (12-16 November) the new C295 Armed ISR version (Intelligence Surveillance & Reconnaissance). A C295 was exhibited on static display flanked by a wide range of weapons which have been selected to be integrated onto this versatile platform.

C295 Armed Version

The C295 is a global reference in the medium transport and ISR segment, with a total of more than 200 aircraft sold to 28 operators in 26 different countries. The last five C295 purchases were announced on the last day of Dubai Air Show, sold to United Arab Emirates.

With this new C295 version, Airbus now offers two weaponized medium aircraft: the Light Weaponized Variant and the Armed ISR.

The C295 Light Weaponized variant features a kit with two manually aimed Machine Guns with lockable firing positions that are secured to the aircraft’s existing cargo rails by metal plates. This solution can be installed in any C295 with minimum aircraft modifications, and is thus an existing kit that can be easily incorporated adding a very valuable capability. The Light Weapons kit is already in operation with an undisclosed customer, featuring two 12.7mm light machine guns which are installed in the rear paratroop doors. To provide a more multi-role solution this kit is also removable, giving the operators full versatility to install them whenever needed, taking only around 30 minutes to perform the full mounting.

On the other hand, the C295 Armed ISR is a persistent ISR aircraft with precision laser-guided munitions that is fully equipped and prepared to respond in the most difficult scenarios. This variant combines a comprehensive set of surveillance sensors and Airbus’s latest iteration of its FITS mission system with a full set of weapons, giving the operators the capability to perform long endurance ISR missions and to provide Close Air Support when needed.

The weaponry that the C295 can incorporate with its efficient under-wing carriage includes Roketsan’s L-UMTAS anti-tank missile, Cirit laser-guided rockets, the Teber-82 laser bomb-guidance kit and Mk 82 warhead and Expal’s CAT-70 un-guided rockets with its multiple rocket launcher. Finally this variant also features Rheinmetall’s BK 27 autocannon and Escribano’s Door Gun System, having all the weaponry integrated with the FITS system so that the operators can accurately perform the targetting.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (AIR.PA) planemaking chief Fabrice Bregier said the company still expects to deliver more than 700 aircraft to customers in 2017, a production record, despite delays in deliveries of engines from suppliers, according to an interview in Monday's Les Echos newspaper.

Bregier said slightly fewer than 600 aircraft had been delivered by the end of November. ""That will require a repeat of the effort made in December 2016, but we're prepared for that,"" he said.

""The technical problems on the new A320 engines are now solved. So we're hopeful production will ramp up as expected in 2018.""

Asked about rumors of the departure of Airbus CEO Tom Enders, who has faced pressure over the conduct of an internal investigation into inaccuracies in filings with U.S. regulators over arms technology sales, Bregier said:

""Let's leave the board to take decisions.""

With its order for 10 units in 2014, the Mexican Navy became the launch customer of this new version. The first four helicopters were delivered in 2016, and the remaining six during the course of 2017.

Stationed at three naval bases in the Mexican states of Veracruz, Sonora, and Michoacan, the helicopters perform an average of 300 flight hours for reconnaissance, patrol missions and training flights.

“The arrival of the MBe Panther has enhanced the Navy Aviation’s operational capabilities,” explained Admiral Jose Maria Garcia Macedo, the Mexican Navy’s general director of Naval Aviation. “It is a modern, multi-mission helicopter that we can use in both maritime and land environments for a wide range of missions, including maritime SAR [search-and-rescue], disaster relief, external load operations and even air ambulance.”

To carry out such a range of missions, the MBe Panther makes use of advanced mission equipment that includes a cargo hook, a rescue hoist, forward-looking infrared (FLIR) for night-time rescue missions and a total of four stretchers for medical evacuation.

“I would like to thank the Mexican Navy for their confidence in our helicopters,” said Mesrob Karalekian, Airbus Helicopters’ vice president for Latin America. “To help ensure success for their critical missions, we have made a technical and logistical support team available to them around the clock in Veracruz. Some 30 pilots have also been trained, many of them receiving specific training in SAR and night vision goggles (NVG).”

The AS565 MBe combines new and proven technologies to offer more value to operators. It is equipped with two Safran Arriel 2N engines, which enhance its performance in hot and high conditions and enable it to achieve a top speed of 278 kilometers (172 miles) per hour and a range of 780 kilometers (485 miles).

It also boasts a new main gearbox, a latest-generation tail rotor and a 4-axis autopilot that reduces crew workload and makes the most demanding missions, such as SAR, easier to perform.

More powerful and efficient, the AS565 MBe is also safer, more cost-effective and easier to operate."

Who said flying is a drag?

One bold and inspired pilot brought seasonal joy to the world by drawing a giant Christmas tree in the sky on a flight path over Germany while doing a test flight of an Airbus A380 aircraft for Emirates.

Recommended US Navy fighter crew grounded after pilot drew penis in sky

The plane set off from Hamburg's Finkenwerder airport at 12.47pm local time and is estimated to arrived back into the same airport at 4.35pm, according to Flightradar.

However, instead of simply doing a few laps, the pilot took the decision to use the flight path to introduce a little more festive cheer. The tree even features baubles by means of regular loops in the flying pattern in between each branch.

The plane cruised at an average 41,000ft while completing the masterpiece, which went south as far as Stuttgart for the tree's trunk before turning northwards towards Hamburg again.

The test flight is for an Airbus A380 ( Flightradar )

It's a more family-friendly piece of aircraft art than the recent flight path that landed a US navy fighter crew in hot water. The crew was grounded after they used their advanced fighter jet to draw a penis in the sky.

The Navy E/A-18 Growler warplane flew in an unusual air pattern in the skies over Okanogan County in Washington state in November, using the condensed air trail from its exhaust to draw the giant image. Pictures of the phallus suspended in the sky immediately went viral on social media.

“Sophomoric and immature antics of a sexual nature have no place in naval aviation today,” Vice Admiral Mike Shoemaker, the commander of naval air forces, said in a statement.

Babcock introduces two H175s to the Southern Hemisphere - Airbus,"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE3LTEyLWJhYmNvY2staW50cm9kdWNlcy10d28taDE3NXMtdG8tdGhlLXNvdXRoZXJuLWhlbWlzcGhlcmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Global offshore service provider Babcock International has taken delivery of two H175s at a ceremony in Darwin, Australia. Babcock’s aircraft are the first H175s to be introduced into the southern hemisphere and will be based in Dili, Timor Leste. The new aircraft will be used to transport personnel and provide search and rescue and medevac support in the Timor Sea, approximately 500 kilometres northwest of Darwin.

Both H175s were freighted to Australia on a single Antonov cargo plane to secure their quick introduction to service on 1 January 2018. The Airbus team has worked closely with Babcock to train 27 pilots and engineers in the assembly, flight and maintenance of the H175s. Babcock will employ a further 19 Timorese to support the aircraft at their base, including four local engineers who will attend training at Airbus Helicopters’ headquarters in France in early 2018.

In making their selection of the H175, Babcock noted that the aircraft is the ‘best of type’ for their purposes, offering excellent payload and superior single-engine performance. The two new helicopters join Babcock’s existing global fleet of xx H175s and will support the company’s regional footprint as they transfer more than 9000 passengers and 30 tonnes of freight each year.

For Airbus, Babcock’s delivery further demonstrates the success of the Airbus H175 programme in offshore operations, following the aircraft’s introduction in the North Sea, Western Africa and the Gulf of Mexico. With extremely powerful engines, up to 270 nautical miles radius of operation and the latest technology in avionics and automation, the H175 was specifically designed to be extremely safe and competitive in the oil and gas, and search and rescue sectors.

Airbus has been a proud partner in the Australasian oil and gas market for many decades. The H175 continues this partnership and paves the way for the decades ahead."

Top 10 aviation stories of the year on Leeham News - Leeham News and Analysis,"Sun, 31 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNy8xMi8zMS90b3AtMTAtYXZpYXRpb24tc3Rvcmllcy15ZWFyLWxlZWhhbS1uZXdzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Dec. 31, 2017, © Leeham Co.: Airplane development and the whimsicle made the Top 10 stories on LNC in 2017.

The Top 10 are a statistical listing of the most-viewed posts, not some judgment call on the part of LNC.

Here is the rundown.

When Singapore Airlines ordered the Boeing 777-9, some suggested this killed the Airbus A380. LNC didn’t think so.

Rather, the A380 was dying under its own weight for its own reasons.

Half the backlog, which is now less than 100 airplanes, is questionable and unlikely to be delivered. The only airline expressing serious interest right now, at least publicly, is Emirates, for 36 aircraft. China is looked at as a possibility, but this has been the case for several years. China falls into the category of “we’ll believe it when we see it.”

Some at Airbus and elsewhere talk about turning the A380 into a Low Cost Carrier asset. This is fanciful.

The 777-9 hasn’t killed the A380. The greater capabilities of new twin-engine aircraft and market segmentation has. The Boeing 787, 777-300ER, Airbus A350 and improvements in range for the A330 combined to kill the business case.

Boeing’s trade complaint against the Bombardier C Series quickly became one of the top topics. Two posts made the Top 10. No. 11 was also a trade complaint piece; it missed making the Top 10 by a mere 100 views.

Bernstein Research issued this note shortly after the Airbus-Bombardier deal was announced in which Airbus agreed to take a 50.01% share of the C Series program. Bernstein went on to compare the C Series with the McDonnell Douglas-Boeing merger and the MD-95 inherited by Boeing. Boeing closed the program after 156 sales. The MD-95 was an orphan, in the 100-125 sector. Boeing wouldn’t launch a larger version, which would compete with the 737-700.

Bernstein thought the situation comparable and predicted Airbus would close the program.

The Airbus A350-1000 was still in testing when LNC discovered a document on the Airbus website with specifications for some enhancements. LNC’s Bjorn Fehrm wrote up the changes. Airbus denied it and took down the document.

It wouldn’t be the first time a document or text was loaded onto the Airbus website that resulted in an LNC post. It wouldn’t be the last.

Delta Air Lines was blunt: the Boeing 737-700 is an uneconomic airplane for Delta. The carrier has only 10 of them, for difficult airports, and didn’t want any more. The 737-7 MAX was also an airplane it didn’t want. The 737 is an outdated airplane based on 1960s technology. The Bombardier C Series is better. Boeing didn’t compete with a new airplane for Delta’s business because it doesn’t have an airplane that competes.

This should have convinced the US Department of Commerce that there was no case to the underlying merits of Boeing’s trade complaint, but it didn’t. Commerce was fully expected to find for Boeing, which has done a great job of massaging Donald Trump’s ego. It did.

Except for Boeing’s extreme partisans, there isn’t an independent analyst that believes Boeing has a meritorious case. Almost all other commentators agreed.

The US International Trade Commission has the case now. A decision from ITC is due in February.

Norwegian Air Shuttle ordered more than 400 Boeing 737s and Airbus A320 family members, plus a bunch of Boeing 787s. It’s expanding aggressively, it created a leasing company and the airline company is losing a ton of money.

LNC examined NAS’s finances and gave an assessment. It wasn’t pretty.

There’s a Boeing subsidiary named Inventory Locator Service. It created a timeline for Boeing airplane development for its website that created worldwide mirth and which became LNC’s fifth most read post of 2017.

Why? It used the Airbus A321for its opening and closing airplane illustration.

It also got airplanes throughout the timeline wrong.

All-in-all, quite the embarrassment. Furthermore, the illustration went live on Friday. It wasn’t taken down until Monday.

With Boeing studying whether the launch the New Midmarket Aircraft (NMA), finding it difficult to close the business case and shooting for an entry-into-service in 2024-25 (or, market intelligence tells LNC 2027), what does Boeing do to bridge the gap to the EIS?

Relaunching a limited run for the 767-300ER was studied. A decision was targeted for the end of 2017, but no word has issued by year-end.

Speaking of NMA, LNC hypothesized how Airbus can kill the challenging business case for the NMA by launching the “A322,” a larger, re-winged, improved engine, longer-range A321neo that could sell for $20m less than the Boeing airplane and be ready years sooner.

Airbus continues to say it’s not interested in a new winged A321, but it is openly talking about an A321neo Plus that has everything but the wing.

This story came in at No. 3 for the year.

For many years, Emirates Airline could do no wrong. It became the best customer for Boeing and Airbus in the Middle East, it ordered hundreds of airplanes, it was the backbone of the A380 orders and it expanded aggressively throughout the world, fending off home airlines in countries EK invaded.

But, then there was a wave or terrorists attacks in Europe which depressed traffic and the US, where the Trump Administration declared no laptops would be allowed in the cabins of any Middle Eastern airline. Traffic plunged.

The campaign by the US Big Three against the Middle East Big Three against alleged unfair state subsidies began picking up steam. Delta Air Lines made life miserable for Qatar’s expansion to Atlanta and American Airlines dropped Qatar from its code sharing. Profits began dropping for all of the ME3; EK’s dropped 80%.

Plagued by over-capacity, EK deferred orders.

LNC took a couple of close looks at Emirates in 2017. This one was the No. 2 post for the year.

A planespotter spotted the Airbus A350-900 test bed with new sharklets. LNC’s Bjorn Fehrm dug into the change and publish the first story anywhere about the change and what the upgrade could do. This became the No. 1 post of the year.

"Reports: Delta Expected to Place Order for Airbus A321neo Jets, Shuns Boeing over Trade Dispute - AirlineGeeks.com","Wed, 13 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2FpcmxpbmVnZWVrcy5jb20vMjAxNy8xMi8xMy9yZXBvcnRzLWRlbHRhLWV4cGVjdGVkLXRvLXBsYWNlLW9yZGVyLWZvci1haXJidXMtYTMyMW5lby1qZXRzLXNodW5zLWJvZWluZy1vdmVyLXRyYWRlLWRpc3B1dGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"[ News ] By Thomas Pallini

According to CNN Money, Delta Air Lines is planning to place a $12.7 billion order for additional Airbus aircraft. The Atlanta-based airline has been acquiring Airbus aircraft over Boeing jets in its last few orders and this announcement comes after a recent trade dispute over the airline’s decision to purchase the Bombardier C Series aircraft.

Delta chose the Airbus A321neo, the newly-enhanced version of the A321 and largest member of the A320 family, for its latest purchase, sources told CNN Money. The A321neo is touted by the European aircraft manufacturer as having increased fuel efficiency and a lower price-per-passenger cost due to its cost saving amenities, such as sharklets.

Currently, Delta uses the A321 on short-haul routes across the country, Atlanta to Washington-Reagan for example, although the aircraft is more than capable of flying the airline’s longer domestic routes.

Other U.S. airlines such as Virgin America, which was acquired by Alaska Airlines in 2016, have also acquired the aircraft for similar reasons and use them on popular transcontinental routes from New York to California, as well as on select over-ocean flights to Hawaii, highlighting the range and agility of this aircraft.

There is speculation that Delta’s decision was not based solely on the merits of the aircraft. A recent trade dispute spearheaded by Boeing may have soured relations between the two aviation giants, thus, damaging a decade-long friendship.

In 2016, Delta placed an order for the Bombardier C Series aircraft, the newest and largest aircraft from the Canadian manufacturer with fuel efficient and passenger-friendly amenities. The deal, however, was perceived by Boeing to be unfair because of the subsidies given to Bombardier by the Government of Canada.

Boeing alleged that Bombardier’s receipt of government subsidies allowed the manufacturer to sell the new C Series aircraft to Delta at a steep discount, undercutting Boeing. This is known as “dumping” to economists and is the process by which a company sells a product to a foreign customer at a lower price than it would sell it for in its home country.

Dumping is driven by government subsidies – in violation of NAFTA, the joint regional trade agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada, and the rules of the World Trade Organization, which governs international trade – as subsidies allow for the products to remain profitable despite selling at a discounted rate. It was because of the rules against dumping that made Boeing’s case against Bombardier.

Boeing filed an official complaint against Bombardier, requesting that the United States Government intervene and place a tariff on the aircraft to counteract the subsidy. The pro-American based manufacturing government under President Trump sided with Boeing and placed a 300 percent tariff on the aircraft.

However, the tariff encouraged Airbus to intervene and forge a partnership with the then-fledgling Bombardier. Under the partnership, Airbus and Bombardier would produce the C Series aircraft in Airbus’ Mobile, Ala. factory, undercutting the tariff and creating more American jobs.

What Boeing thought was skillful maneuvering to get Delta’s business was actually a huge blow to their relationship. Delta needed a short to medium sized aircraft with medium passenger capacity, which Boeing does not produce.

The smallest Boeing aircraft, the Boeing 717 which Delta already owns, does not have the fuel efficiency capabilities that the C Series has. The next highest aircraft would be the Boeing 737 MAX 7, which Delta must have thought was too big for what they needed.

By filing a complaint against Delta and Bombardier in order to get Delta to buy an airplane from Boeing that didn’t meet their needs, Boeing effectively shot itself in the foot. Delta’s newest deal with Airbus for its A321neos over Boeing’s 737 MAX aircraft is indicative of this.

Delta’s CEO Ed Bastian, despite the fight over the trade dispute, stated that Delta will still purchase Boeing airplanes. In an interview, Bastian stated: “Yes, we will be taking more Boeing aircraft.” That statement is only logical as Boeing is still one of the largest aircraft manufacturers in the world, along with Airbus.

This isn’t the first time that Boeing and Airbus fought for customers over its medium-range aircraft.

For years, Boeing’s 757-200 aircraft was a direct competitor of Airbus’ A321. Both have similar passenger capacity and range, but the 757 was favored by airlines due to its increased performance capabilities over the A321. More recently, the Boeing 737-900ER, the largest member of the Boeing 737 family, was a more equal competitor.

As Boeing and Airbus move into the next generation of their iconic aircraft with the Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus A320neo, it seems as though the race for fuel efficient, long range and passenger friendly aircraft is in full swing.

Author Thomas Pallini Tom has been flying for as long as he can remember. His first flight memory was on a Song Airlines 757 flying from LaGuardia to Orlando. Back then, he was afraid to fly because he thought you needed to jump off the plane in order to get off. Some years later, Tom is now a seasoned traveler, often flying to places just for the fun of it. Most of the time, he'll never leave the airport on his trips. If he's not at home or at work as a Line Service Technician at Long Island MacArthur Airport, he's off flying somewhere, but only for the day."
