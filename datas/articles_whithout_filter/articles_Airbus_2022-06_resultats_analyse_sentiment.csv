Safety innovation #1: Fly-by-wire (FBW) - Airbus,"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTA2LXNhZmV0eS1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLTEtZmx5LWJ5LXdpcmUtZmJ30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It’s a fact, our industry has achieved huge improvements in safety since the 1950s, especially over the last three decades, and technology has made a significant contribution in ensuring that the safety records of the whole aviation industry have very significantly improved.

In this series, we revisit some of the innovations that have provided a significant step change in improving the safety of our products. Let’s start with fly-by-wire.

What is it? We call fly-by-wire the flight control systems which use computers to process the flight control inputs made by the pilot or autopilot, and which send corresponding electrical signals to the flight control surface actuators. This technology replaces direct mechanical linkage.

Among other advantages such as weight saving by removing cables, pulleys and rods, fly-by-wire has allowed to improve safety, reliability and aircraft manoeuvrability.

First developed on military aircraft and on Concorde, fly-by-wire technology has equipped all Airbus aircraft including A220 since the first A320, back in 1988 and the most modern version of concurrent aircraft, such as the B777, B787 and Embraer E-jets.

Designated as the fourth-generation aircraft, the planes that have been operated since then have accumulated over 30 years of in-service experience. This represented more than 200 million accumulated flights at the end of 2021 by a fleet of more than 14,500 aircraft in service, which is a strong statistical basis. Fly-by-wire has significantly improved aircraft safety and operations efficiency.

Airbus sending 3D printer to space station next year to pave way for off-Earth factories - Space.com,"Wed, 08 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS9haXJidXMtbWV0YWwtM2QtcHJpbnRlci1vcmJpdGFsLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1mYWN0b3J50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European aerospace manufacturer Airbus wants to make satellites in orbit from space junk in four years.

European aerospace company Airbus will send a metal-crafting 3D printer to the International Space Station next year as a first step in its plans to set up an orbital satellite factory.

The printer, called Metal3D, can work with metals that melt at temperatures of up to 2,100 degrees Fahrenheit (1,200 degrees Celsius). It will be the first metal 3D printer on the space station , Airbus said in a statement , and will enable astronauts to print parts such as radiation shields and various tools. (American company Made In Space, now a subsidiary of Redwire, has sent several 3D printers to the space station , but none of them can print metal.)

Future versions of the 3D printer, the company added, will be able to make objects using lunar soil and also recycle parts from old satellites.

The Metal3D printer is only one component in a range of technologies developed by Airbus with the goal of setting up a space factory. In a series of videos, Airbus showed off a robotic manipulator designed to assemble spacecraft.

""Airbus' solution is to launch kit parts that will be assembled in space by the robotic arms from our space factory,"" the company said in the statement.

The robotic arms will be able to build each other in orbit, Airbus said, but could also be used to repair and refuel spacecraft.

The company said it would like to be able to manufacture entire satellites in space in the ""next three to four years.""

""Since there is enough space in space, it will be possible to build bigger structures such as huge reflectors, allowing telecom satellites to cover the entire planet,"" Airbus said in the statement.

Moreover, producing satellites in space will also be kinder to the environment, the company said, as fewer polluting rocket launches will be needed.

""The material for production can be sourced from the space debris floating around,"" Airbus said. ""So with the space factory, Airbus is also helping to clean up space and ensure a sustainable future for the industry.""

When it comes to the Metal3D printer, the space station is only its first destination. By the end of this decade, Airbus said, a similar device might be churning out parts of lunar rovers and habitats directly on the surface of the moon.

Airbus ponders withdrawal of type certificate for Lama - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2FpcmJ1cy1wb25kZXJzLXdpdGhkcmF3YWwtb2YtdHlwZS1jZXJ0aWZpY2F0ZS1mb3ItbGFtYS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Above: Swiss operator Air-Glaciers had as many as 16 Lamas and five Alouettes in its fleet in 2005.

Once the undisputed king of the mountains, the Aérospatiale SA 315B Lama helicopter is now facing permanent grounding following more than half a century of legendary service.

There are more than 200 Lamas and Alouettes still in operation, according to Airbus estimates. Robert Niederwolfsgruber Photo

Citing difficulties with maintaining airworthiness and flight safety, Airbus Helicopters — which holds the type certificate for the Lama as well as its predecessor, the Alouette III — notified operators on March 23, 2022, that it was conducting a “global situation analysis” of the Alouette and Lama fleets.

The OEM bulletin indicated this analysis is being performed “as part of a reflection on the continuation or withdrawal of Alouette & Lama type certificates.”

Operators of these types were asked to submit their in-service fleet details by May 30, 2022. But, while the manufacturer encouraged operators to come forward to share their information, not every operator seems to have received Airbus Information Notice 3752-I-00.

Scott Chase, president of Essential Flight Operations in Darrington, Washington, is one of the Lama operators who was not contacted. Instead, he received the notice via a friend at Switzerland’s Air Zermatt.

Chase’s company operates four airworthy SA 315B Lamas and has parts and inventory on hand for an additional five airframes.

Founded in 2009, Essential Flight Operations focuses on utility and agricultural work, using its Lama fleet for spraying, fertilizing and forestry jobs. In addition, the company provides global maintenance support to Lama and Alouette operators, helping them source parts and complete maintenance. Chase’s wife, Gabriela, is chief pilot at the company.

“We obtained our first Lama out of Washington state about two years ago,” Chase told Vertical. “It’s exceedingly simple and robust. They are very comfortable to fly. Everything about them makes them a fantastic helicopter for the utility world.”

Originally designed to meet Indian military requirements for hot-and-high performance in the Himalayas, the single-engine SA 315B Lama first flew in 1969 and was certified the following year. It was the result of combining the lightweight Alouette II airframe with the dynamic components of the Alouette III.

On June 21, 1972, Aérospatiale test pilot Jean Boulet set a helicopter altitude record in the Lama, soaring to 40,820 feet (12,442 metres).

Reportedly nicknamed the “mule of the air” by the pilots that flew her, the Lama quickly established itself as the most capable helicopter for mountain operations. Indeed, it facilitated considerable alpine development, including ski resorts, mountain bases and more.

Operators also used the craft for oil-and-gas exploration, longlining and lifting, firefighting with a Bambi Bucket, and search-and-rescue missions. In fact, they quickly found the Lama, powered by the Turbomeca Artouste IIIB1 turboshaft engine, could go where other helicopters could not follow.

According to Airbus Helicopters, there were 3,245 Alouettes and Lamas built over the years, which have recorded over 19 million flight hours.

But, as the decades passed, the costs of operating the Lama increased and parts became more difficult to obtain.

To combat this problem, Essential Flight Operations began stockpiling airframes and inventory. Recently, it purchased two Lamas from Air-Glaciers in Switzerland.

“Operational costs have been historically high when dealing with Airbus on component overhauls,” said Chase. “The fleet has gotten small . . . due to a lack of support for perhaps the last six to seven years.”

Airbus believes there are 202 Lamas and Alouettes still in service, combining to record 18,500 flight hours in 2021.

Speaking in Unison

Chase said there have been industry rumblings for some time that Airbus was looking to surrender the Alouette and Lama type certificates.

When his friend at Air Zermatt sent him the Airbus information notice, it wasn’t a big surprise. Immediately, Chase sat down to email the manufacturer. He wanted them to know that Essential Flight Operations was interested in assuming the Alouette and Lama type certificates, along with the responsibility of supporting the global fleet. In fact, he’d been trying to communicate that to the OEM for some time, but hadn’t had any luck connecting with the appropriate person.

“I would like to emphasize that we have a strong interest in continuing the H1IN and 7H1 type certificates,” wrote Chase on March 24. “We are flexible in coming up with a solution that benefits all parties involved. This solution could be in the form of us becoming the certificate holders, an agreement between Airbus and our company, or many other creative solutions.”

On April 8, an Airbus Helicopters representative replied. He indicated that “the global support of the Alouette platform is no longer possible, for several and various reasons.”

The listed points include difficulties in manufacturing and delivering spare parts, “the impossibility to perform overhaul on [the] Artouste engine,” as well as the fact that main and tail rotors for the aircraft are no longer manufactured.

The Airbus spokesperson also told Chase that several customers have asked the manufacturer to withdraw the type certificate, “in order to have those Alouette classified as collection aircraft.”

He concluded by saying that while Airbus appreciates Chase’s passion for these aircraft, “the conditions are no longer met for Airbus Helicopters (or any other entity) to be able to maintain those type certificates. The situation deteriorates year after year, Airbus Helicopters is therefore no longer in a position to ensure continuing airworthiness and the flight safety at the expected level nowadays.”

Flight safety is the big concern for Claude Vuichard, renowned aviation safety advocate and president of the Vuichard Recovery Aviation Safety Foundation.

“From my side, I look at the safety,” he told Vertical during a telephone interview. “For me, it’s important who is taking care of it, what you can do with the aircraft, and what does it mean if the TC (type certificate) is withdrawn? The business is gone, except maybe air work in certain countries.

“One of the main problems I see is with the engine, with no maintenance or spare parts,” continued Vuichard. “My position as a safety expert is that you need to know where parts are coming from. It’s really important for the safety angle. To be safe, you need to have access to spare parts with a guarantee they are coming from a reliable source.”

In his response to Airbus, Chase reiterated his desire to assume the Alouette and Lama type certificates and suggested possible solutions that he feels would benefit both the OEM and operators.

“For a very long time, Airbus has not been interested in supporting this aircraft anymore,” he told Vertical, speaking specifically of the Lama. “To my knowledge, I’m the only one who wants to take it over. If we had the type certificates, we would be responsible for manufacturing new parts. We would support our own fleet and other operators around the world, and we would be responsible for ensuring safety compliance with operators.

“But if Airbus wants to keep the type certificates, then I’d be willing to establish a Lama-specific Part 145 repair station to perform component and engine overhauls.”

For engine overhauls, Chase pointed out to Airbus that there are still some facilities with this capability. In addition, he said, a U.S. facility currently has approval to manufacture SA 315B composite rotor blades.

Despite making his pitch to Airbus, Chase isn’t very optimistic at this point.

A May 4 email, the most recent he received from Airbus on the matter, noted that the OEM was still in discussions with the European Union Aviation Safety Administration (EASA) about withdrawing the Alouette and Lama type certificates. However, wrote the spokesperson, “I prefer to warn you that it is unlikely that Airbus Helicopters will transfer the type certificate [for the] Alouette to your company or to any other.”

Vertical approached Airbus Helicopters for comment, but had received no reply by the time this article was published.

Chase is frustrated. Without a type certificate, Essential Flight Operations could continue to legally operate the Lama for a short period of time, at least until all available parts have been cannibalized off its spare airframes.

“The problem is that the aircraft would be completely unsupported,” he lamented. “Many other countries that operate the Lama won’t be able to operate it legally anymore. It invalidates supplemental type certificates and it’s the nail in the coffin for the Lama at that point. It will be an economic disaster for anyone operating these helicopters. It’s an unfortunate situation.”

Nothing Like a Lama

Western Aerial Applications of Chilliwack, British Columbia, is the only active SA 315B Lama operator in Canada.

Founded in 1986, the specialized aerial applications company has been flying the Lama helicopter since the late 1990s. Currently, Western Aerial has five in its fleet — but to conserve parts and engines, it generally operates only two at a time.

“Our number one business is forestry,” said Josh Jonker, general manager of Western Aerial. “Our main focus is helping to grow trees through brush control and fertilization, and the Lama is a key asset. I think most operators are finding it difficult to get parts for it, like we are. We are starting to think beyond the Lama, towards a [Airbus AS350] B2 or B3 replacement, but that’s a loose term. Nothing replaces the Lama. You can’t compete with it, because you give up some capability somewhere — the Lama is still unmatched as to what it can do in the mountains.”

Jonker cited the Lama’s incredible tail rotor authority, excellent rate of climb and pilot visibility, as well as its powerful engine, as the type’s key attributes for high altitude precision work. Its engineers put the emphasis on weight savings and exceptional utility performance.

“I can talk to you for hours about why the Lama outperforms anything else in the mountains,” he told Vertical. “The B3 is beautiful, but it’s all about smoothness and passenger seats. In contrast, the Lama is a stripped down, no-nonsense pickup truck — not a limousine. When your only business is aerial applications, the B3 doesn’t cut it. The Lama is so good all day long at hauling things.”

Jonker received the Airbus information notice in March and said it’s obvious the language is getting more pointed.

“A notice like that sends a message: Suppliers, don’t put any more money into maintaining this aircraft. They begin to reduce their parts inventory, so whether or not it takes effect, it sends a message through the industry not to invest in the Lama.”

He said that in the fixed-wing world, aircraft older than the Lama are still supported by their OEMs.

“Our reaction is, can they really do this? Pull the rug out from underneath us? They may say it’s because of the low numbers, but there really is no replacement,” continued Jonker.

“There are other companies that have bought type certificates from other manufacturers, and that is a solution we would support, especially if we were involved somehow. We are looking for creative options on two fronts: Airbus and Turbomeca [Safran], for the engine. I’m hoping that if somehow we could get one to turn, maybe the other would as well.”

If the type certificate is withdrawn, Jonker said Western Aerial will have to stop flying the Lama, which is why it’s now looking at a contingency plan. Unfortunately, he noted, that means it “would have to absorb the inefficiencies and make the most of another aircraft.”

End of an Era?

Swiss operator Air-Glaciers obtained its first SA 315B Lama in 1971. Ralf Tonezzer, the company’s technical manager, said the helicopter quickly became a symbol in the Swiss Alps.

“It proved its efficiency and versatility both in transporting people and equipment, rescue missions and vineyard spraying flights,” he wrote in an email to Vertical. “As proof of its efficiency, Air-Glaciers counted 16 Lamas and five Alouettes in its fleet in 2005.”

However, the end of an era came in May 2021, when Air-Glaciers said farewell to its last Lama — selling the aircraft and all related inventory to Chase at Essential Flight Operations.

“Since the engine of the last Lama in the fleet had reached the end of its service lifetime, this was the time chosen to say goodbye to this great helicopter model,” wrote Tonezzer, who added the company has replaced it with the AS350 B3, which he said has “quicky become the new standard.”

Unfortunately, Tonezzer feels the end of the Lama’s commercial operations probably can’t be prevented.

“It’s sad that the withdrawal of the type certificate seems to be forthcoming. We decided to sell [the aircraft] to Scott Chase because we wanted to support him in his project and we were excited that HB-XRE would continue to fly in North America.

“But this kind of aircraft may continue to be operated as historic aircraft for private flights, even without valid type certificates, in consultation with national aviation authorities and their laws,” continued Tonezzer. “It will always be a great pleasure and a nice memory when, in the future, hopefully a Lama can be admired in the sky in a national historical category.”

For his part, Chase is in no rush to see Alouette and Lama helicopters relegated to historical status.

“We have a helicopter that has been in service for more than half a century in the most challenging environments,” he said. “Over this time period and millions of hours flown, pilots, mechanics, and the OEM have been able to identify areas that are critical to flight safety on the Lama. The actual flight data is there to show how safe this aircraft actually is. Combine this with modern technology, and you would have an aircraft that surpasses the safety of new aircraft with real-world flight data to prove it.”

He encouraged all affected operators to contact Airbus Helicopters promptly about the situation, since it impacts business viability for the entire community.

“I’ve done everything in my power to come up with a solution, but Airbus does not seem interested,” he said. “I think it’s very urgent that other operators speak up about this situation because it will affect all of us financially. It’s just a very unfair situation. Airbus should allow someone else to take the lead on this.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8780984282493591}",neutral,0.8780984282493591,0

""Airbus’s ties to the Chinese market appear to carry outsize risk,"" Horizon Advisory says in its report, which has been shared in advance with POLITICO. ""Airbus-China engagement entails significant ties to China’s military and military-civil fusion apparatus, including in the form of supply dependencies, technology sharing, and research and development cooperation,"" it adds.

On its web site, Airbus notes that its China operations are only one element of a big industrial program in the Asia-Pacific region, saying that it has partnerships ""with more than 600 firms in 15 countries supplying parts for Airbus aircraft.""

Horizon Advisory's report, funded independently by the organization itself, is likely to make for an uneasy read for many EU politicians and lawmakers who have grown increasingly skeptical of the traditional way of doing business with China.

A spokesman for Airbus said: “Airbus' relationship with Chinese companies, including AVIC, is fully compliant with all European and international laws and regulations, notably with regards to the existing arms embargo on China. As such, Airbus' industrial and technology partnerships in China are exclusively focused on civil aerospace and services.”

He added: “China is a strategic partner in Airbus' operations. For example, Airbus has joint ventures in multiple locations across the country, such as with the Tianjin Free Trade Zone and China Aviation Industry Corporation (AVIC), to support production of Airbus aircraft.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9947457313537598}",neutral,0.9947457313537598,0

Japan's first SAF helicopter flight with H215 - Airbus,"Wed, 01 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wNi1qYXBhbnMtZmlyc3Qtc2FmLWhlbGljb3B0ZXItZmxpZ2h0LXdpdGgtaDIxNdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tokyo, 1 June 2022 – Airbus Helicopters in Japan and Japan’s leading helicopter operator Nakanihon Air (NNK) have jointly performed the country’s first ever helicopter flight powered with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). NNK’s H215 helicopter conducted a 30-minute flight at Nagoya Airport in Aichi Prefecture today.

The aircraft was fueled with 600 litres of “SUSTEO 10”, a renewable jet fuel produced by Japan’s first biofuel manufacturer Euglena, which has met the specifications of both international and Japanese standards of diesel fuels ASTM D1655 and JIS K 2204 respectively. SUSTEO contains 10% of SAF mixed with Jet A-1.

“We are happy to collaborate with Airbus Helicopters in Japan and Euglena on sustainability efforts for Japan’s sky, achieving the first SAF helicopter flight together,” said Hajime Futagami, President of Nakanihon Air. “Today’s SAF flight trial is very important for our company as we work on the reduction of the CO2 emitted during flights in an effort to tackle climate change issues. The locally produced SAF is an immediate approach towards reducing carbon emissions for the helicopter market. We are looking forward to the continued support from Airbus on our wide-ranging activities in Japan, with the enhanced precision and stability we require,” he added.

“We are pleased to launch this milestone SAF flight together with our long-standing customer as we work towards decarbonisation,” said Guillaume Leprince, Managing Director of Airbus Helicopters in Japan. “As a leader in the Japanese helicopter market, this SAF powered flight is an important step in a shared vision we have with stakeholders in the helicopter market and the industry to reduce CO2 emissions in the country. The H215 has fully demonstrated its ability and readiness to provide enhanced mission efficiency and performance our customers have come to expect.”

The twin-engine, heavy-lift H215 is a member of the Super Puma helicopter family, known for its high availability rate, performance, and competitive operating cost.

Today, all Airbus helicopters are certified to fly with up to a 50% blend of SAF mixed with kerosene, with the aim to reach 100% SAF in coordination with engine manufacturers. An Airbus H225 performed the first ever helicopter flight with 100% SAF powering one of the Safran Makila 2 engines in 2021. Helicopter operations with 100% SAF would translate to a reduction of 80% of CO2 emissions.

Airbus Helicopters has launched a SAF User Group dedicated to the rotary-wing community, in a bid to drive the deployment of biofuels. The company has also started using SAF for training and test flights at its French and German sites.

Airbus and Munich Airport International expand their partnership to develop Advanced Air Mobility solutions globally - Airbus,"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wNi1haXJidXMtYW5kLW11bmljaC1haXJwb3J0LWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtZXhwYW5kLXRoZWlyLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwLXRv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Berlin, Airbus and Munich Airport International have signed a Memorandum of Understanding at ILA Berlin Air Show to start marketing turnkey solutions to cities and regions interested in developing advanced air mobility (AAM) ecosystems globally.



Airbus is developing CityAirbus NextGen, its electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, along with key support and services offerings around it, while Munich Airport is offering ground infrastructure services and solutions.



“Munich Airport International is already collaborating with Airbus on the Air Mobility Initiative recently launched in Munich - now we are expanding that partnership globally to support select cities and regions around the world,” said Ivonne Kuger, Executive VP Corporate Development MAI. “As Europe’s first 5-star airport Munich Airport has always been at the forefront of innovation and it is crucial for airports to be actively involved in developing and paving the way for this new form of transport”, Kuger adds.



“The development of the market, industry, and the ultimate service of AAM requires a holistic view and this has been our approach from the beginning. In addition to our decades of vehicle and technology development, certification, and support, we are actively building working ecosystems with our partners,” said Balkiz Sarihan, Head of UAM Partnerships and Strategy Execution at Airbus. “We are sure that our partnership with Munich Airport will be a key catalyst for accelerating the development of the AAM ecosystems worldwide.”



The successful integration of the different AAM elements requires a strong cooperation between global and local stakeholders combining key competencies. The objective is to create completely new ecosystems that ensure a safe and seamless integration of eVTOL solutions with other means of mobility bringing added value to cities and communities.



Airbus has been one of the pioneers in exploring how electric propulsion can help drive the development of new kinds of aerial vehicles. In September 2021, the Company unveiled its fully electric eVTOL prototype, CityAirbus NextGen. Airbus is developing an AAM solution with eVTOLs not only to offer a new mobility service but also as an important step in its quest to reduce emissions in aviation across its product range. The company recently announced the launch of the Air Mobility Initiative, a consortium of partners dedicated to the advancement of AAM in Bavaria and Germany.

Airbus and Linde to cooperate on hydrogen infrastructure for airports - Airbus,"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wNi1haXJidXMtYW5kLWxpbmRlLXRvLWNvb3BlcmF0ZS1vbi1oeWRyb2dlbi1pbmZyYXN0cnVjdHVyZS1mb3LSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Berlin, 23 June 2022 – Airbus and Linde, a leading global industrial gases and engineering company, have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to work on the development of hydrogen infrastructure at airports worldwide.

The agreement follows a cooperation agreement signed in Singapore in February and covers collaboration on global supply chains for hydrogen, from production to airport storage, including the integration of refuelling into normal ground handling operations. Both companies will define and launch pilot projects at several airports from early 2023 onwards. In addition, Airbus and Linde will analyse the potential of Power-to-Liquid fuels - a type of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) made from the synthetically produced liquid hydrocarbon through the conversion of renewable electricity.

""We are advancing well with hydrogen as an important technology pathway to achieve our ambition of bringing a zero-emission commercial aircraft to market by 2035. Building the infrastructure is just as crucial. That's why we are working closely with partners like Linde, who have decades of experience and expertise worldwide in the storage and distribution of hydrogen,"" said Sabine Klauke, Chief Technical Officer, Airbus.

“We are pleased to expand our successful collaboration with Airbus to a global scope,” said Philippe Peccard, Vice President Clean Energy, Linde. “By harnessing both companies’ competencies we are well positioned to collaborate with airports and government authorities in the development of viable concepts for sustainable airport hubs based on hydrogen.”

The use of hydrogen to power future aircraft is not only expected to significantly reduce aircraft emissions in the air, but could also help decarbonise air transport activities on the ground. In 2020 Airbus launched the “Hydrogen Hub at Airports” programme to jumpstart research into infrastructure requirements and low-carbon airport operations, across the entire value chain.To date agreements have been signed with partners and airports in France, Italy, South Korea, Japan and Singapore.

The first ZEROe concept aircraft were unveiled in 2020, and development of the corresponding technology bricks is now underway in a global R&T network focused on developing the hydrogen technology for future commercial aircraft.

Can the tracking of in-flight catering improve airline sustainability? - Airbus,"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTA2LWNhbi10aGUtdHJhY2tpbmctb2YtaW4tZmxpZ2h0LWNhdGVyaW5nLWltcHJvdmUtYWlybGluZS1zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0edIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"How can more precise tracking of in-flight catering – from meal and beverage service to the collection and disposal of waste – lead to more sustainable air travel?



Airbus’ highly innovative digital solution to this challenge includes the automatic capture of data for passengers' onboard meal consumption, along with tracing the amount of unused food and drinks that remain. By integrating such information in an artificial intelligence-driven system, airlines could optimise their catering services and better manage the after-meal disposal – leading to a potential for double-digit reductions in their CO2 emissions through weight reductions and fuel savings.

Elements of this solution have undergone initial evaluations in realistic conditions aboard the Airspace Explorer – a dedicated cross-programme flight test platform that Airbus utilises to test and demonstrate new innovations for future aircraft cabins.



The volume of airline cabin waste is expected to double by 2030

“The numbers speak for themselves: an estimated 1.43 kilograms of cabin waste is generated by each passenger per flight, of which more than 20 percent is represented by untouched food and drinks,” explained Michael Bauer, an Airbus Cabin and Cargo Architect. “The situation becomes more critical with the prediction that overall airline cabin waste – which totalled 6.1 million tonnes in in 2018 – is expected to double by 2030.” Source IATA survey issued in 2021.

IATA survey issued in 2021Key to Airbus’ solution for the tracking and controlling of in-flight catering is the Food Scanner, an artificial intelligence-enabled device that analyses the composition of food in a simple point-and-shoot process. It uses the same principle as scanners that are increasingly available in supermarkets today.

The Food Scanner’s downward-looking camera identifies what is on the meal tray as the cabin attendant pulls it out from the trolley during the in-flight service, and subsequently captures pictures of what remains when the tray is returned. A horizontally-oriented barcode scanner tracks the beverage bottles and cans that typically are placed atop the trolly.



Optimising data from the Food Scanner’s utilisation

A cloud-hosted dashboard would use trends and statistics for catering prediction and planning to minimise waste.



Data from the Food Scanner can be processed via a separate, off-board cloud-hosted dashboard that generates KPIs (key performance indicators), using trends and statistics to enable highly accurate catering planning and the prediction of food/beverage consumption. This can be further optimised with a pre-flight meal ordering system made available for passengers – which already is being used by a growing number of airlines, particularly for their premium travellers.

The advantages of Airbus’ in-flight catering tracking solution are numerous. In addition to reducing the amount of food and beverages carried during flight – with the associated lower aircraft weight and reduction in fuel burned – the Airbus solution holds the promise of better management over the amount of food produced at the origin, along with the reduction in dedicated catering space aboard the aircraft, as well as enhancing the waste collection and separation process. Additionally, it would limit the amount of food and beverages that are discarded upon arrival – with certain countries requiring such waste to be burned.



The Food Scanner goes airborne on Airbus’ Airspace Explorer aircraft

The Food Scanner was demonstrated aboard Airbus’ Airspace Explorer aircraft during a recent South Asian demo tour.

“The first feedback from airlines and their cabin crews was positive,” said Sascha Thoerner, the Airspace Explorer Programme Architect at Airbus. “Demonstrating the Food Scanner in such a realistic environment with end-to-end connectivity is an important step toward maturing this system. Airbus would then be able to work with potential partners – including the airlines, caterers, and system manufacturers – for in-service trials, followed by eventual production.”

Airbus’ Airspace Explorer is taking advantage of a specially configured A350-900 flight test aircraft fitted with an award-winning Airspace cabin to test and showcase a number of customer-centric innovations. These innovations are focused on passenger experience, digitalisation, onboard health and sustainability.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9334649443626404}",neutral,0.9334649443626404,0

The companies will work together to develop an ultra-lightweight rear fuselage, which plays a key role in the airframe’s flight efficiency and which meets the high standards of reliability and performance for Airbus' electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) prototype.



The two partners will design high-end composite solutions and components that will equip CityAirbus NextGen’s rear structure, through a collaborative framework that enables them to mutually benefit from each company’s competencies in design engineering and manufacturing processes.



Joerg Mueller, Head of Urban Air Mobility at Airbus, said: “The partnership with KLK Motorsport and Gerg GmbH will provide CityAirbus NextGen with a fully integrated, ultra-lightweight rear fuselage. Directly interacting with the center fuselage and the wing, the rear structure will leverage both suppliers’ expertise in homogeneous design for FormulaE and Formula One vehicles, while complying with the most stringent safety and reliability standards”.



KLK Motorsport and Gerg GmbH have been working on end-to-end composite design and manufacturing solutions for a number of years. This partnership to develop the rear structure of CityAirbus NextGen is a continuation of the work undertaken by both suppliers on Airbus’ high speed demonstrator Racer, for which KLK Motorsport and Gerg GmbH provided an innovative carbon fibre canopy, optimised for low aerodynamic draft and high visibility.



In September 2021, Airbus unveiled its eVTOL prototype CityAirbus NextGen, to explore advanced air mobility technologies and bring urban air mobility services to life. Over the past few months, the Company has selected partners for structural components of its prototype, such as Thales and Diehl, who will develop the aircraft’s flight control computers, or Spirit

AeroSystems for its wings. Airbus is also working closely with industrial and institutional partners to lead the development of urban air mobility ecosystems, as recently announced with ITA Airways in Italy, or through the launch of the Air Mobility Initiative in Germany.

Airbus-built Earth observation satellite (SARah-1) ready for launch - Airbus,"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wNi1haXJidXMtYnVpbHQtZWFydGgtb2JzZXJ2YXRpb24tc2F0ZWxsaXRlLXNhcmFoLTEtcmVhZHktZm9yLWxhdW5jaNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Latest radar technology together with very fast alignment and flexible shaping of the antenna beam enables extremely high-resolution observation of the Earth's surface, regardless of time of day and weather conditions

Friedrichshafen / Vandenberg, CA, USA, 13 June 2022 – The Airbus-built ""SARah-1"" Earth observation satellite, under subcontract to OHB System AG, has been transported from Friedrichshafen, Germany, to Vandenberg, California, USA, and is currently being prepared for launch in June 2022 and subsequent operation by Airbus in space.

SARah is a new operational reconnaissance system consisting of several satellites and a ground segment, which was developed on behalf of the German Bundeswehr. As the successor system, it replaces the SAR-Lupe system currently in service and offers significantly enhanced capabilities and system performance.

Overall responsibility for the complete SARah system lies with OHB System AG, Bremen, as prime contractor, which holds the main contract from the Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support (BAAINBw). Airbus is the main subcontractor. The architecture of the overall SARah system consists of a space segment with three radar satellites (2 x OHB, 1 x Airbus) and a ground segment connected to two ground stations.

Airbus Defence and Space in Friedrichshafen developed the satellite with the latest, highest-resolution radar technology as well as jointly developing the ground segment to operate its own satellite. The company is also responsible for the launch, calibration and validation of the radar satellite, with final in-orbit delivery.

The radar instrument developed and built by Airbus features a sophisticated active phased array antenna and represents a further development of the Airbus-built TerraSAR, TanDEM-X and PAZ Earth observation satellites already successfully operating in orbit. This technology offers the advantages of very fast pointing and very flexible shaping of the antenna beam to deliver imagery in record time.

In general, radar satellites, with both passive and active antenna technology, allow observation of the Earth's surface regardless of the time of day or weather conditions.

The satellite, built by Airbus, weighs around four tons and will be launched from Vandenberg, California, USA.

The launch and commissioning (LEOP) of the satellite will be supervised from Airbus' control centre in Friedrichshafen. The subsequent calibration, validation and operation will be carried out from the Bundeswehr control centre.

Satellite-based landing system | FAST Online | News - Airbus Aircraft,"Wed, 01 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vYWlyY3JhZnQuYWlyYnVzLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzcm9vbS9uZXdzLzIwMjItMDYtc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWJhc2VkLWxhbmRpbmctc3lzdGVt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thanks to global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) including GPS, aircraft navigation has significantly evolved over the past 25 years. Even if *ILS (Instrument Landing System) remains the primary means for precision approaches, new satellite navigation technologies are now in place to perform approaches. Airbus has integrated these new technologies with an ILS look-alike interface which benefits from the ILS operational experience. The most recent of these to be rolled out is a new certified cockpit avionics function for operators of the A320 and A330 families, for line-fit and retrofit – referred to as a satellite-based/augmented landing system (SLS).

This function enables pilots to perform ‘straight-in’ approaches using satellite positioning into airports, even in low-visibility conditions. SLS first entered service in Europe with the A350 in 2015 after Airbus pioneered its development and introduction for *CAT1 approaches with the support of the EU Agency for the Space Programme (EuSPA), formerly known as the European GNSS Agency (GSA), and the European Commission. SLS is also available on the A220 Family and will be soon offered on the A380.

Facilitating precision approach access to secondary airports

SLS capability enhances the airlines’ operations by enabling stable approaches especially at airports currently not having precision approach means; at main runways as a backup to ILS (e.g. during maintenance), or at alternate airports in case of diversion.

Mathieu Hialé-Guilhamou Engineering Navigation Specialist explains: “It is often the ‘secondary airports’ which are less likely to have sufficient throughput of traffic to justify the cost of installing radio-based ILS equipment on the ground. By contrast, ILS is usually present at primary airports to allow precision tracking of the glidepath down to the runway decision height, and is especially useful in bad weather or when there are obstacles below the approach. Now, with the combination of SLS capability in the aircraft and SBAS augmentation coverage in the sky, the aircraft is able to perform accurate ILS-like CAT1 approaches in low-visibility conditions into the secondary airports too.”

Pilot-friendly ILS-like display symbology

Since the SLS function design was fully integrated into the cockpit display architecture it was possible to make it very pilot friendly. The result is that with SLS pilots don’t have to change the way they fly the aircraft because the guidance symbology presented in the cockpit (on the “Primary Flight Display” – the PFD) looks just the same as what they are already used to for an ILS approach. In particular, the lateral and vertical magenta moving chevrons (below and to the side of the pilot’s attitude indicator respectively) are identical to the ILS equivalent – see PFD illustration below. In addition, along the top of the PFD and during an SLS approach, pilots will see the same familiar guidance modes “G/S” (vertical ‘Glide Slope’) and “LOC” (horizontal ‘Localiser’) status indications – in blue when armed or green when active.

Diagram showing similarities between ILS and SLS mode symbols on PFD.

In fact, there are other optional landing systems available for Airbus operators (which are beyond the scope of this article to describe individually) but which provide the same magenta lateral and vertical symbology for pilots, as well as the familiar LOC and G/S notifications on the PFD. These include: GBAS Landing System (GLS) and FMS Landing System (FLS) for non-precision approaches (e.g. using VOR, DME, NDB and LOC only). Since they are presented in the same way to pilots, they form collectively a group called “xLS”.

Positioning augmented by SBAS overlay satellites

Through the aircraft’s GPS antenna, its multi-mode receiver (*MMR) receives data from GPS satellites, known in this aviation context as the “Global Navigation Satellite System” (GNSS). In addition to those positioning sources, the MMR also receives overlay corrections from “Satellite-Based Augmentation Systems” (SBAS), which transmit their signal via Geostationary Satellites. One of the reasons that the corrections are needed for accurate approaches is to counter possible ionosphere-induced position errors. Another reason is to continuously monitor and confirm the overall integrity of the GPS signal.

Diagram showing GPS and SBAS satellite constellation architecture. The red arrow is on the left, the measurement of error over a continent by ground stations, and the sending by a master ground station to a geostationary satellite. On the right the geostationary satellite sends back the GPS correction to users, like an SBAS receiver-equipped aircraft.

The aircraft’s MMR also computes in real-time the accurate horizontal and vertical guidance which can be streamed to the electronic flight displays and autopilot. Moreover, this allows the autopilot to guide the aircraft along the computed reference trajectory, which can be monitored on the pilots’ displays.

Alternatively the pilot can ‘hand-fly’ the aircraft by following the magenta lateral and vertical SLS-generated guidance chevrons (see diagram below). In this way SLS provides the aircraft with real-time precise satellite-augmented position information to provide either the human pilot or the auto-pilot with guidance in both the lateral and vertical axes. This is known to flight crews as “Localizer Performance with geometrical Vertical guidance” (LPV).

PFD diagram showing closeup of horizontal and vertical guidance symbols.

SLS approaches avoid reliance on barometric altitude or radio-based ILS

“An *RNP approach (*RNP APCH) to LPV minima (ie. using SLS) has the advantage of not relying on conventional barometric altitude nor temperature calibration. This contrasts with today’s *RNP approaches which use *LNAV/VNAV, as well as conventional “non-precision approaches” which are affected by variations in barometric altitude and temperature,” notes Hialé-Guilhamou.

“Fortunately with SLS, since its vertical guidance is no longer barometric but geometric, and regardless of the meteorological conditions, the aircraft’s final approach segment is always at the same position in space. This is a huge benefit, which directly categorises an LPV approach as “precision approaches equivalent”, down to CAT1 minima,” he adds.

Pilots have commented that the digital SLS satellite-based data can be more resilient than a CAT1 ILS analogue radio signal – because with SLS, the aircraft’s position relative to the trajectory is always available. Whereas with ILS, being terrestrial and radio-based, it can sometimes be susceptible to false localiser (denoted by ‘LOC’ on the PFD) or the glideslope (denoted by ‘G/S’) side lobes as well as interference affecting the ILS ‘protected area’. Nevertheless, VHF-radio based ILS remains, for the time being, the only certified means for a commercial airliner to perform a CAT2 approach or a CAT3B ‘auto-land’ onto the runway and subsequent rollout.

Prerequisites / enablers for SBAS

While the operation is largely seamless for the pilots, behind the scenes a variety of enablers had to be created in order for SLS to exist. These include:

Upgraded avionics on board the aircraft. These need to embody the new functions to support SLS. These avionics include: “Multi-Mode Receiver” (MMR) – which hosts the SLS function; the Flight Management System (FMS) – which hosts in its navigation database each discrete SLS procedure on a per-runway/airport basis; the Flight Warning Computer (FWC) and the autopilot (AP). To date the Honeywell FMS has been certified for use with the SBAS function, while the Thales FMS option is planned to be ready for the introduction of the A321XLR.

Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) coverage. These are civilian-controlled space satellite constellations providing positioning and timing data. Examples of GNSS include Europe’s Galileo, the USA’s NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS), and China’s BeiDou Navigation Satellite System. Today all Airbus aircraft are equipped to use the GPS constellation for positioning and navigation.

Satellite-Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS)coverage, such as the “European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service” (EGNOS). SBAS satellites improve the accuracy and reliability of GNSS information by correcting any ionosphere-induced signal errors and by providing information about the integrity of its signals. For US airspace the SBAS augmentation is provided by the “Wide-Area Augmentation System” (WAAS) and in India by “GPS Aided GEO Augmented Navigation” (GAGAN). Other SBAS satellites are being deployed in Japan, Australia/New Zealand and China, and also being developed for South Korea and Africa.

Diagram showing A320 SLS main function components.

“Until very recently, SBAS has been widely used in commercial aviation to support “Area Navigation” for en-route lateral navigation in lieu of traditional ground-based Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) beacons, especially in the United States,” explains Hialé-Guilhamou. “This is to provide more accurate and available position data to the Air Traffic Controller, through the ADS-B (Automatic Dependant Surveillance - Broadcast) technology – mandated in the US from 2020. And for Europe, with SLS already operational with the A350 and A220 and now also entering service with A320 Family operators – starting in May 2022 with easyJet – Airbus, the EU and its partners are taking SBAS to the next level to provide vertical guidance for approaches down to CAT1 / 200 feet minima.”

Global uptake of SLS and LPV approaches

For any given airport runway, there needs to be a tailored SLS / LPV approach procedure in place if an operator wishes to perform an SLS approach there. Moreover, this tailored LPV procedure first needs to be assessed, designed, approved by the local aviation authorities, documented/published, and also pre-programmed into the aircraft FMS approach database – before any aircraft can perform an SLS landing. The uptake of such approved LPV approaches is rapidly increasing worldwide. In the USA LPV availability is particularly strong: As of March 2022 there were more than 4,100 LPVs serving almost 2,000 airports. This was helped by the fact that the US continent enjoys almost unbroken WAAS/SBAS satellite augmentation coverage from coast-to-coast.

Diagram showing world-wide SBAS coverage.

Meanwhile, in Europe, as of May 2022, there are 750 operational LPV procedures with another 500 planned in the short/mid-term.

“With these and other parallel advances, SLS CAT1 approaches with LPV are therefore likely to become the norm across the European Union by 2030, taking precedence over ILS Cat 1 operations,” says Hialé-Guilhamou. “This is underscored by the European Commission’s publication in 2018 of an “implementing regulation” which lays down airspace usage requirements for Air Navigation Service providers, to provide services for all operations based on “performance-based navigation” (PBN), ie. using satellite navigation, except for Cat 2 and Cat 3 precision approaches – which will continue to use ILS.”

A short history of SBAS…

SBAS was originally developed in the US to support its Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) programme. WAAS was introduced in the USA in the early 2000's primarily to provide for the needs of general aviation. “At that time, the focus did not extend to mainline commercial aviation since ILS was so widespread at airports frequented by larger airliners,” recalls Thierry Harquin, Engineering - ATM International Cooperation Manager. “However, the arrival of the equivalent (EGNOS) in Europe had pushed commercial aviation and Airbus to reconsider SBAS, leading to its adoption for the A350 programme to introduce it from the Entry Into Service (EIS).”

SBAS was also considered for other Airbus programmes, however, the required avionics development costs were significant. Nevertheless, the deployment of SBAS procedures accelerated throughout Europe in the mid-2010s, with capabilities allowing even CAT1 performance. France’s DGAC authority decided to remove ILS CAT1 on secondary airports and replace them exclusively by SBAS procedures – ie. LPV procedures, which would later be facilitated in Airbus aircraft by the SLS function.

Later, in 2016, Airbus had been looking at opportunities to launch it on the A320 and A330 as it would be beneficial to incorporate a CAT1-equivalent precision approach capability into any airport without any ILS infrastructure on the ground. “Airbus’ air traffic management (ATM) team answered an EU call for tender, to develop it on the A320,” says Harquin. “The green light was duly achieved in 2017 for SLS to be launched on the A320 and A330. Subsequent development took around 3.5 years, and continued despite a slowdown due to the Covid pandemic. EASA certification was obtained on the A320 in October 2021, with first delivery in May 2022.”

Definitions\Glossary:

*CAT1/2/3 = Precision Category approach defines the precision in terms of ‘decision height’ and ‘runway visual range’. (“CAT3” is the most precise of these.)

*ILS = Instrument Landing System is a system which works by sending a VHF radio beam downrange from the runway end, with aircraft that intercept it to be guided on a continuous ‘glide-slope’ towards the runway.

*MMR = Multi-Mode Receiver is a navigational avionics system which incorporates signals from multiple types of navigational and landing systems, including GPS, SBAS, SLS, FLS, VOR/MKR, ILS, and integrates them into a single presentation, using the combination of signals to verify the accuracy of others. This allows an air-transport aircraft to use the most advantageous form of navigation, without having to add additional equipment, regardless of where the aircraft is operating in the world. Each Airbus aircraft is equipped with two MMR computers.

*LNAV/VNAV = These straight-in approaches were the first type of GPS approach that had vertical guidance. LNAV = Lateral Navigation. This is a term used to refer to guiding the aircraft’s lateral position using GPS/GNSS. VNAV = Vertical Navigation. This refers to vertical guidance based on the aircraft’s barometric altitude. LNAV/VNAV minimums higher than 250 feet above touchdown for most approaches. (SLS approach minimums can go even lower because of the greater accuracy.)

*RNP APCH: RNP approaches are enabled by GNSS. Modern avionics can provide both lateral and vertical guidance along a defined path when it is published as an RNP approach. These approaches are described by a series of waypoints, legs that connect the waypoints and any speed and altitude constraints required on that procedure. This information is held in the aircraft’s navigation database.

Airbus and Kansai Airports partner to study the use of hydrogen in the decarbonisation of the aviation sector in Japan - Airbus,"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wNi1haXJidXMtYW5kLWthbnNhaS1haXJwb3J0cy1wYXJ0bmVyLXRvLXN0dWR5LXRoZS11c2Utb2YtaHlkcm9nZW4taW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Osaka, 10 June 2022 – Airbus and Kansai Airports have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to explore the use of hydrogen at three of the Group’s airports in Japan (Kansai International Airport, Osaka International Airport, and Kobe Airport).

Through this partnership, Airbus and Kansai Airports will jointly prepare a roadmap to address challenges and define an advocacy plan for hydrogen needs. Both parties would lead the study into the development of infrastructure for the use of hydrogen in the aviation sector.

Each partner will leverage their complementary expertise to help define the potential opportunities that hydrogen can offer in support of the decarbonisation of the aviation industry. Airbus will provide aircraft characteristics, fleet energy usage, and insight on hydrogen-powered aircraft for ground operations. Kansai Airports will study the infrastructure required at the airports for the introduction of hydrogen-fuelled aircraft.

“We are very pleased to have Kansai Airports, one of Japan's major airport groups, on board,” said Stéphane Ginoux, Head of North Asia region for Airbus and President of Airbus Japan. “Hydrogen is one of the most promising zero-emission technologies as it can be created from renewable energy and does not produce emissions. Renewable hydrogen will help decarbonise not only aircraft but also all airport-associated ground transport.”

“We have set a target to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 for the three airports we operate, and this partnership with leading aircraft manufacturer Airbus will help us reach this goal,” said Yoshiyuki Yamaya, Representative Director and CEO of Kansai Airports. Benoit Rulleau, Representative Director and Co-CEO, added, “We are glad to extend here in Japan the joint efforts between Airbus and our shareholder VINCI Airports, leading the introduction of hydrogen in airports, to decarbonize air transport. Japan boasts a very active environment in the field of hydrogen development.”

Airbus is already working in partnership with airports around the world including the MoU with VINCI Airports, to lead the scale-up of hydrogen use in the aviation industry. This MoU with Kansai Airports is the first one Airbus has signed with an airport operator in Japan and follows the one signed with Kawasaki Heavy Industries last month to work together towards the realisation of a hydrogen society in Japan.

Norwegian Air Ambulance Foundation and Airbus prepare for the future of HEMS - Airbus,"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTA2LW5vcndlZ2lhbi1haXItYW1idWxhbmNlLWZvdW5kYXRpb24tYW5kLWFpcmJ1cy1wcmVwYXJlLWZvci10aGUtZnV0dXJlLW9m0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Copyright of banner image: Airbus Helicopters - Anthony Pecchi

The Norwegian Air Ambulance Foundation was the very first operator to receive the new five-bladed H145 at the end of 2020. In close collaboration with Airbus, the Foundation uses it for various research projects all aimed at improving Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) in Norway.

For more than 40 years, the Norwegian Air Ambulance Foundation has been working on providing new and innovative air ambulance solutions. With backing from more than 300,000 support members and companies, the Foundation acquired the new five-bladed H145. Working closely with Airbus, the Foundation is using it for research, development, and training with the goal of improving HEMS services.

“We aim to save more lives and improve the health of patients. Helicopter emergency services bring the hospital to the patient – wherever they are at the time of critical illness or injuries – and we are constantly working on ways to make it even better,” explains Hans Morten Lossius, Secretary General of the Norwegian Air Ambulance Foundation.

“This Research & Development helicopter is a game-changer for what we can accomplish – not only in Norway, but also in collaboration with other relevant international partners. As far as we know, it is the only helicopter in the world dedicated to HEMS improvement alone. It allows us to conduct testing on new procedures and equipment, collect data for our research projects and provide training without relying on rotating a helicopter out of the emergency services,” Lossius adds.

Smart ideas for improving patient care in the air

The Foundation is made up of more than 120 employees ranging from medical researchers, engineers, designers and HEMS crew members with many ongoing projects looking at specific ways to improve HEMS. Even Wollo, an industrial designer who has worked for more than five years for the Foundation, explains how many of these projects start:

“We have what we call a “SmartLAB”, where we collect improvement ideas from people working in the different areas of our air ambulance service. They range from developing a new rescue helmet and modular flight suits, to creating VR-training to improve patient treatment and apps that allow dispatch centers and doctors to see the emergency site and the patient’s injuries via video link.

Parallel to the SmartLAB projects, we work on strategic development projects such as tailoring the medical cabin to the work of the physician in order to improve safety and enable the best critical care possible. We are even working on concepts for CT scanning compatibility with the helicopter emergency service and remote emergency sites.

Airbus has been a close partner during the Foundation’s research and development. Wollo explains, “It is through this collaboration, workshops and continuous exchange of experience regarding medical operations that Airbus Helicopters is able to improve existing systems. In addition, the experience and feedback gained can also influence future developments.”

Medical care challenges for rural environments

Norway - a country known for its beautiful nature, endless fjords and magical lakes - is also challenging when it comes to providing fast emergency care for people living in rural areas.

“Per year, there are around 15,000 stroke patients in Norway. Many of them live in the countryside, where the nearest hospital with a CT scanner is far away,” explains Wollo. “Our mission is to bring the hospital to the patient, and the only diagnostic tool for stroke is a CT scanner. So we needed to bring the CT to the patient. First, we built a special mobile stroke unit manned with a similar crew to the air ambulance service. Our research proved that diagnosis and treatment could be done before arriving at the hospital. Time is critical after a stroke so every minute is crucial for getting the right care and improving the outcome. Now we are working on concepts for putting a CT scanner into our five-bladed H145. Our aim is to give the patient the same treatment whether they live in a city or the countryside.”

Adding high-tech medical equipment to the five-bladed H145

When implementing new equipment into a helicopter, weight is one of the most important factors. “A conventional CT scanner weighs more than 200 kg, even if you remove everything that is not 100% necessary. In addition, it has a lot of moving parts, is fragile and needs a lot of space. Currently we are looking at the on-going development of CT-scanners using nano technology. This new technology has fewer and no moving parts and weighs much less. It is also more robust and could cope with prehospital use better than conventional technology. We believe it is possible to install this type of CT scanner in a helicopter.”

For integrating this high-tech equipment, a lot of knowledge about the helicopter is essential. “The colleagues at Airbus have been great in supporting us with 3D models and measurements of the helicopter. Also, the knowledge about the architecture of the helicopter has helped us to find the right areas to install our devices in the cabin.” Wollo adds that the five-bladed H145 is also well suited for these missions because of its smooth ride and experience on-board. “We hope to have the CT scanner implemented into our test-helicopter in the next four to five years.”

Airspace Link – bringing the connected vision to reality - Airbus,"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTA2LWFpcnNwYWNlLWxpbmstYnJpbmdpbmctdGhlLWNvbm5lY3RlZC12aXNpb24tdG8tcmVhbGl0edIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The mobile phone revolution which is happening on the ground, with more than seven billion smartphone users, is also taking place in the air. By 2027 Airbus expects almost 30,000 aircraft to be equipped with connectivity to support this exponentially growing digital appetite. But the trends encompass much more than smartphone usage. It also extends to the ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT) to connect, experience and control all the smart elements which we already take for granted in our homes – such as window blinds, fridges, coffee machines, air conditioning, home-entertainment systems, and so on. And similarly inside our cars. These consumer expectations are set to be mirrored inside our aircraft cabins as well.

Teams throughout Airbus have been hard at work defining, developing and demonstrating the ‘connected’ in-cabin technologies which we want to roll-out over the coming months and years.

“This roadmap first came to the fore thanks to Airbus “Connected Cabin Experience” mockup which we demonstrated for visitors at industry trade shows from 2018, and where we have won awards, such as Crystal Cabin,” recalls Ingo Wuggetzer, VP of Cabin Marketing at Airbus.

“Here Airbus not only demonstrated mockups on the ground, but our engineers also flight-tested real working technologies – including IoT for the first time – on our dedicated A350 Flight-Lab test aircraft, dubbed the ‘Airspace Explorer’.”

“Airbus also has produced its “Vision 2030” which focuses on the digital future of the cabin experience, and has presented this at various customer workshops to show a glimpse of what airlines can expect in the future. With such initiatives, Airbus is well prepared to turn this vision into reality,” says Ingo.



From concept to reality: “Airspace Link”



At the June 2022 Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg Airbus is introducing the first elements of a real open connected ecosystem which is called ‘Airspace Link’.

“Airspace Link is a multi-layered and flexible approach, which starts with the Intelligent Core Management Platform – ICMP. This is the digital backbone covering the cabin management system as well as other layers,” explains André Schneider, VP of Cabin & Cargo Programme at Airbus.



He adds: “The next ‘brick’ of Airspace Link ecosystem are the IoT services which enable us to connect all the different elements within the cabin such as the overhead bins, the galleys, the seats, life vests.”

“We will also have what we call simply the ‘App Store’ that will host various applications for passengers as well as for airlines.”

“Last but not least, is the ability to connect the aircraft with the outside world. And here we are working on the connectivity elements, both air-to-ground and also satellite-based to have a flexible connectivity layer – so we can really move towards an end-to-end platform.



1. Airspace Link iCMP: intelligent Core Management Platform



The iCMP is SFE hardware provided by Airbus and is a replacement for our well known “Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS). iCMP uses fibre-optic technology and provides the infrastructure for a digital smart platform enabling data access and management, content hosting, including IFE, and cabin management controls. iCMP full functionalities platform will be available on cross-programme starting with A320 family from 2026. In the meantime our “Head end Server Unit” (HeSU), provided by Kid Systeme, is available today as line fit and retrofit. The overall aim of the iCMP is to realise one platform connecting everything on board, which is open, flexible and efficient.



2. Airspace Link IoT Services: Smart data-based services



Based on smart cabin and cargo -enabled elements, Airspace Link also brings efficiencies for airline operations by aggregating relevant cabin data, combining those with different data sources (eg. CRM, ground-operations, supplier,) as input for big-data analysis. This enables IoT services for optimisation of ancillary revenues, passenger experience and operational efficiency.

Already tested in-flight on the Airspace Explorer Flight-Lab aircraft since 2019 are OLED welcome panels, digital galley, connected seats – Stelia business class seats and Recaro economy class seats – as well as elements of a “connected cargo” system.



3. Airspace Link App Store: apps for passengers and airlines



The Airspace Link App Store is a marketplace available to our airline customers. Apps can be offered from app developing partners, airline internal developers and Airbus Services. It allows Airbus, the airlines and or app developers to bring new functionality and content to the platform easily and efficiently.

Airspace Link ‘Wireless IFE’ is our first Airspace Link app available. This service is delivered to the airline by one of the three partners: Bluebox, Inflight Dublin and Display Interactive and is available today. Airspace Link Wireless IFE was launched with Titan Airways in 2019 and two early adopters: Jetstar Airways for its new A321neos, and with Condor for its A330neos starting this year.

“It will be a marketplace also for developers to come up with new ideas and we also see how fast the business is growing,” notes André. “So here we have the opportunity to open it up at aircraft level, enabling greater flexibility, also for airlines to integrate any kinds of apps in the future.”



4. Airspace Link “Connect”: The agnostic connectivity platform



To provide an end-to-end offer, we also need to connect the aircraft with the ground. To this end, and in the frame of the open ecosystem, we provide our customers with the flexibility to choose air-to-ground (ATG) or satcom solutions:

ATG for efficient broadband connectivity using radio-telephony transmission to be tailored for regional operations; and HBCplus – high-bandwidth satellite connectivity – which aims to become the one agnostic, SFE cross-program connectivity platform, capable of hosting multiple satcom providers.



In contrast to today’s provider-dependent connectivity end-to-end platforms, HBCplus offers airlines flexibility by utilising one standard Airbus hardware/software platform, including a standard low-profile antenna, radome and terminal. Entry into service of the Ka-band satcom solution is planned for 2024, with Ku-band planned to be introduced at a later stage.

Airbus launched HBCplus at the Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX), together with Inmarsat Aviation as the first managed services provider (with more joining soon), and Safran Passenger Innovations (SPI) responsible for the terminal and antenna provision and integration.



With Airspace Link one can really apply the metaphor of a ‘flying smartphone’ because this is what we want to provide a connected aircraft ecosystem like a smartphone as easy to use for passengers and flexible for the airlines and our partners!

Airbus awarded FORUM Earth monitoring satellite contract from ESA - Airbus,"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wNi1haXJidXMtYXdhcmRlZC1mb3J1bS1lYXJ0aC1tb25pdG9yaW5nLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1jb250cmFjdC1mcm9tLWVzYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Mission to measure heat emitted from Earth into space

€160M FORUM mission due to launch in 2027

Stevenage, 28 June 2022 - Airbus has been awarded a €160M contract for the European Space Agency’s (ESA) FORUM satellite to measure heat emitted from the Earth into space. FORUM, short for Far-infrared Outgoing Radiation Understanding and Monitoring, will be the first satellite to observe Earth in the far-infrared part of the spectrum, providing unique measurements of the Earth’s outgoing energy to help improve understanding of the climate system.

Measurements from FORUM’s spectrometer will enable scientists to compile a high resolution view of the Earth’s greenhouse effect and the properties of ice clouds and water vapour in the atmosphere. Airbus is mission prime with OHB providing the instrument.

Jean-Marc Nasr, Head of Airbus Space Systems said: “This critical Earth observation mission to measure infrared radiation from the Earth for the first time, will give scientists and climatologists the data they need to improve their global warming forecasts.

“It builds on Airbus’ heritage in designing and manufacturing cost efficient small Earth observation missions including Sentinel-5P and is the sixth Airbus primed Earth Explorer mission for the European Space Agency.”

Science Minister George Freeman said: “This important new mission to further improve the accuracy of climate forecasts and view our planet through new eyes is another illustration of UK space tech expertise. Scientists at Imperial College London provided key support to ESA in defining FORUM’s science objectives and the satellite is set to be built by Airbus in Stevenage. This is a significant industrial contract which demonstrates the UK’s strengths in Earth observation technology and satellite manufacturing, as well as our global leadership in tackling climate change.”

Simonetta Cheli, ESA’s Director of Earth Observation Programmes, said, “We are thrilled to award the industrial contract to Airbus in the UK as Prime Contractor for FORUM, with OHB in Germany responsible for the instrument. FORUM adds to our highly successful family of Earth Explorer missions and, by acquiring novel information, will bring great benefits to climate science.”

Airbus in Stevenage will lead the development of the satellite, with Airbus in Germany responsible for the Instrument signal detection chain, and Airbus in France providing platform product support.

Using in-orbit proven technology will considerably reduce risk and costs on the programme. Avionics for the mission have been developed, validated and flown together on previous missions, which will enable savings in verification activities, software development and operating procedures.

The main instrument on FORUM will be a Fourier Transform Spectrometer operating in the far-infrared. The Sun’s incoming shortwave radiation is absorbed at the Earth’s surface and re-emitted into space, through the atmosphere, at longer infrared wavelengths. FORUM will measure the signature of this outgoing radiation, from which a crucial understanding of water vapour, ice clouds, surface snow and ice, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas characteristics can be derived. The satellite will also be equipped with a thermal imager for ground sample validation.

The FORUM satellite will fly in a loose formation ahead of the MetOp-SG A1 satellite for synergistic observations using MetOp-SG A1’s infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer. Using MetOp’s data at shorter infrared wavelengths will complement and further improve FORUM’s own science.

Procurement from small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) will be a key element of the FORUM mission to further enhance the space supply chain across ESA member states. The 883 kg FORUM satellite will be in a polar orbit at an altitude of 830 km and is scheduled to launch on a Vega-C launcher from Kourou, French Guiana in 2027. FORUM will be the 9th Earth Explorer mission of ESA’s Future EO Programme.

Overview

By continuing to adjust its response during the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, the Foundation successfully worked with existing and new partners to support activities that protected and saved lives, helped preserve the Earth’s increasingly fragile ecosystem, and inspired the youth of today who will become the decision-makers of tomorrow.

The Foundation leverages Airbus products, services and people to address the challenges of today's society. During 2021, this involved a cross-section of Airbus businesses, built on the dedication of Airbus employees and the Foundation’s management team.

Rachel Schroeder was named the Airbus Foundation Managing Director in 2021. One of her first priorities was to develop the newly identified Environment pillar. The Foundation defined its work in this area with a commitment to address climate change and the impact of humans on the environment. Airbus products and services in climate assessment and prediction – especially its Earth-viewing satellites – are powerful tools, and they were a valuable resource whose support ranged from the preservation of wildlife and ecosystems to assessment and monitoring.

Responses to natural disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic were key drivers for the Airbus Foundation’s humanitarian response in 2021, supporting missions in Africa, South America, the Caribbean and the Asia/Pacific. Airlift missions performed with Airbus flight test aircraft and through the deliveries of new Airbus-built airliners to its customers carried tonnes of aid and equipment. Helicopter flight hours sponsored by the Airbus Foundation enabled the transportation of vital aid and material directly to areas affected by severe weather, floods, an earthquake, as well as to regions significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Foundation signed a cooperation agreement with the Global Logistics Cluster (GLC), solidifying the relationship and reinforcing a commitment to work together over the long-term.

The Foundation’s youth development programmes continued to deliver initiatives, helping stimulate the imagination of young students to help them stay engaged at school and prepare them to be constructive global citizens. The highly appreciated animated features of the Airbus Foundation Discovery Space – which cover various aerospace subjects in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) – were complemented with new topics such as the “Flightpath to Hydrogen” or the “experience” videos, while the Moon Camp Challenge is once again motivating students to envision the future of space exploration.

Other developments initiated in 2021 included the setting up of an Advisory Council for the Environment that draws in additional support and advice, as well as challenges the Foundation to evolve. Also, an impact platform for employees is being developed for roll-out in 2022 to further the involvement of Airbus personnel in support of Foundation partners. Finally, the new Airbus Foundation Endowment Fund gives employees and people outside Airbus the opportunity to donate directly to the Foundation in support of its humanitarian response activities.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9963040351867676}",positive,0.9963040351867676,1
"Airbus goes supplier-furnished for HBCplus IFC, including on A350 - - Runway Girl Network","Thu, 16 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjIvMDYvYWlyYnVzLWlubWFyc2F0LXNhZnJhbi1oYmNwbHVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HAMBURG — Airbus is offering a new linefit supplier-furnished catalogue option for inflight connectivity across all its commercial aircraft programmes — notably including the A350 — selecting as its first partners Safran Passenger Innovations as terminal provider and hardware integrator, using ThinKom’s popular VICTS antennae, plus Inmarsat as a managed service provider supplying its Ka-band satellite-powered Global Xpress service.

The program, which Airbus calls Airspace Link HBCplus, will see the European airframer provide the broadband connectivity kit — and related services — as linefit supplier furnished equipment (SFE) meaning that Airbus will not only factory-fit the hardware to A320, A330 and A350 twinjets, but will have overall responsibility to airline customers. As such, Airbus touts that HBCplus will be “a new certified terminal and radome built as part of the aircraft”.

The package will involve a traditional outside-the-aircraft installation with an adaptor plate, external to the fuselage, and will also be available for retrofit. And whilst HBCplus will initially encompass Ka-band services, as powered by Inmarsat GX, Airbus assures that airlines will be able to connect to a “choice” of managed service providers (MSPs), and that HBCplus will in time be extended to include MSPs which offer Ku-band services.

ThinKom’s VICTS — variable inclination continuous transverse stub — technology, which is the core antenna component of HBCplus, is already flying onboard thousands of aircraft. A Ku-band version, for instance, is incorporated into the 2Ku package offered by satellite operator Intelsat (formerly Gogo), and is already rolling off the line on the Airbus A220 and A320. Thales, too, has a relationship with ThinKom, but for its regionally-focused retrofits of IFC to Spirit Airlines’ fleet, powered by Hughes and SES capacity.

Inmarsat, meanwhile, last year opted to position GDC Technics’ (now Stellar Blu’s) new inflight connectivity terminal – with ThinKom’s Ka-band VICTS antennae – as not just an integral part of its GX+ North America regional IFC collaboration with Hughes Network Systems, but a global solution for GX aero transmissions and in doing so, ensured that airlines had another retrofit terminal option for GX, outside of the longstanding Honeywell JetWave system.

The ThinKom Ka2517 product that makes up the antenna hardware element of HBCplus is “robust and has proven itself in service… with the various satellite constellations”, notes John Andrews, vice president for connectivity at Safran Passenger Innovations. In other words, this is not some kind of novel technology.

Also in the ‘already proven’ category is Inmarsat’s near global GX constellation, powered by GEO satellites, which according to Airbus business development manager, connectivity Nils Schmeink, has the highest current demand from Airbus customers (multiple Inmarsat GX-powered IFC offerings are already linefit offerable as buyer furnished equipment at the airframer).

But for HBCplus Airbus is looking into other technologies, including Ku-band and other Low Earth Orbit constellation options, from various players in the market, notes Schmeink. “We are starting with Inmarsat, but we’re talking closely to a couple of other partners we cannot announce for the time being,” he explains.

ThinKom’s VICTS solution, meanwhile, can support transmissions via LEO, MEO or GEO satellites as well as multi-orbit networks such as LEO/GEO or MEO/GEO.

Indeed, HBCplus will be inherently flexible from the start, with Safran Passenger Innovations revealing that Astronics will provide the dual-modem modem manager (modman) which “integrates multiple third-party aero modem cards in a 4MCU enclosure”. Furthermore, SPI states that the launch version of the modman “will include the iDirect iQ800 modem with multiple additional configurations available to provide flexibility for Safran Passenger Innovations and Airbus customers”.

Astronics will also provide the new Outside Aircraft Equipment support structure comprising a radome, adapter plate, skirt and associated wiring “to complement ThinKom’s antenna with a simplified installation design and novel use of quick disconnect fittings to improve serviceability”.

Inmarsat’s senior vice president for inflight connectivity William Huot-Marchand tells Runway Girl Network that the plan is not to simply attract smaller, niche airlines without inflight connectivity suppliers, as other SFE such as minimum-configuration economy class seats do.

For all airlines, he expects, HBCplus “will be the model that will be imposing itself, because the advantages are too great. The airlines that are massive airlines, with huge teams, I think they will see the benefits of it, where the value added of the connectivity is not necessarily having a great antenna, because it is already a given when it is there: it’s adding the service that come with that. And this is where we work with the airlines.”

“It will change totally the way — it’s kind of a little revolution — the way we do business with the airlines,” Huot-Marchand concludes.

Among those advantages is the fact that A350 customers will have an option to uncouple their IFE and connectivity selections — for the first time, with a caveat — if they so choose.

This aspect is newsworthy in its own right. Because while Airbus has long offered multiple satellite connectivity solutions from multiple suppliers on the A320, A330 (and before it was shuttered) the A380, as part of its so-called High Bandwidth Connectivity (HBC) buyer furnished equipment program, it pursued a different path for the A350. The airframer’s so-called Aircraft Contracted Supplier (ACS) catalog approach for the A350 saw it largely pair same-vendor IFE and connectivity if an airline wanted IFE + C factory-fit.

So, for instance, under the paired-up IFEC paradigm, if an A350 customer ordered Panasonic IFE and wanted a linefit high-bandwidth IFC solution, it would have to take Panasonic’s offerable Ku IFC. The same applied to Thales, whose linefit IFC package transmits via Inmarsat GX with Honeywell JetWave terminal; and later Safran Passenger Innovations (then as Zodiac’s Zii), whose IFC package also supports Inmarsat GX with Honeywell JetWave.

Asked by RGN if Airbus is effectively supporting uncoupled IFE and C selections on the A350 with this move, Airbus reveals:

In combination with HBCplus every catalog IFE solution can be selected. If the BFE connectivity solution is selected then bundle approach still applies (eg. The same IFE + IFC supplier).

So effectively, the uncoupling can go one way — if an airline chooses a BFE connectivity solution, then it must choose the bundled same-vendor IFE on the A350. If it chooses HBCplus for SFE connectivity, it can pick any offerable IFE system which includes the big three, Panasonic, Thales and Safran Passenger Innovations.

In taking this direction, the airfamer is making good on a vow it made back in 2015 to ultimately offer an uncoupled option on the A350. And clearly more options are in the works.

Moreover, in a nod to the importance of the connected aircraft in this post-pandemic environment, Airbus also clearly sees a benefit to directly providing inflight connectivity kit and related services to its customers as SFE — an approach it more commonly pursued for lavatories, seats, galleys and cabin monuments.

For industry observers who have been around for a decade or two, this fresh push towards supplier furnished equipment will ring some faint warning bells. Airbus spent the best part of a decade resolving reputationally damaging passenger experience problems resulting from its last foray into SFE linefit catalogue options.

Satellite radomes are not economy class seats, and nor are they lavatories. But with eighteen months at the inside before Airbus expects the partnership to enter into service during 2024, much work will need to be done to ensure the robustness of the HBCplus contractual model.

Airbus develops “light-refit” larger overhead bins for A320 family - Runway Girl Network,"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjIvMDYvYWlyYnVzLWRldmVsb3BzLW5ldy1saWdodC1yZWZpdC1sYXJnZXItb3ZlcmhlYWQtYmlucy1mb3ItYTMyMC1mYW1pbHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tucked into the very back of the Airbus booth at the Aircraft Interiors Expo, well behind the new business class suites, wafer-thin inflight entertainment screens, and new connected IoT wifi systems, was the passenger experience innovation that has the chance to affect the greatest number of travellers worldwide: larger overhead bins.

Not the XL bins announced in 2017 as part of the A320 Airspace cabin, nor the 2019 agreement to launch the bins pre-Airspace on American Airlines. Rather, these are a quick, efficient and responsive post-COVID pivot — if you’ll pardon the bin-related pun — to a new bin model that requires only a relatively light refitting of the cabin onboard Airbus A320 family aircraft.

While the benefits of bigger bins are clear, after two-and-a-half years of pandemic disruption some cash-strapped and operationally challenged airlines and lessors aren’t up for the full cabin refit for the XL bins. That refit includes new ceiling panels, air outlets, cabin LED light unit, riser ducts and underbin monuments.

The XL Bin, Airbus vice president for cabin marketing Ingo Wuggetzer tells Runway Girl Network, “is a huge improvement on volume, so that everybody can bring one bag of the biggest size on board. What we got as feedback is that a lot of airlines want to retrofit, but if you retrofit that bin, you also need to go for a new lining in the ceiling and the sidewall, because they’re different and it doesn’t fit anymore.”

So what is an airline to do that wants more bin space but doesn’t want to relook — that’s French for “refresh” or “revamp” — their entire cabin, as Airbus puts it?

Enter the Airbus Large Bin: not as large as the XL bin, but based on the same design and adding an impressive three extra bags per bin, for a total of eight, compared with the previous generation of Airbus bin — while requiring 30% fewer parts to change in the retrofit process. The L bin re-uses a substantial part of the existing cabin, with only new covelight panels to install and oxygen boxes to modify.

“The L Bin gives you a minimum of change — that means maximum reuse of existing parts,” Wuggetzer tells RGN. “You can stay with the sidewall, you can stay with the ceiling — you have one transition panel we add and that’s it. Lighting: you reuse what you have from before. That makes it a lot faster, in terms of downtime, I think it’s only three days or four days of downtime. And in terms of cost, of course you save because you can reuse the parts.”

Where the XL bin can fit bags on their side at 24” height, 16” width and 10” depth, the L bins’ maximum bag dimensions are slightly smaller at 22.8” height, 16” width and the same 10” depth. But it’s not just the size of the bin, it’s where the support structure is located, hence the number of bags per box staying the same as the XL at eight bags, up from five on the previous generation of bin.

In practice, the inch smaller width and height feels like it will be mostly unnoticeable for most passengers, with only those road warriors who measure their bags to the maximal fraction of an inch likely to have to turn their bag sideways.

Airlines are certainly keen on bigger bins. Airbus says it has sold 1000+ shipsets of the XL bins, including 200+ on retrofit, to 31 customers of which 7 are low-cost carriers and 24 are full-service carriers.

Airbus isn’t alone in the retrofit market, of course. Diehl Aviation has Enlarged Bins in its portfolio and Safran Cabin’s ECOS Shelf Bins were refitted onto the first of 24 Air France Airbus A320s in July 2021. But there’s certainly something attractive for an airline, or indeed a lessor, to fit into the standard Airspace design language and have the airframer-supplied bins when it comes to long-term value for an aircraft.

By applying its leading-edge digital capabilities to Multi-Domain Military Operations, Airbus provides seamless integration solutions that connect mission-critical military platforms and systems worldwide across all domains: air, land, sea, cyber and space.

Airbus is there every step of the way: from information downlinked by its Earth observation satellites and airborne platforms to powerful computing resources based on artificial intelligence, along with securing the servers where this information is stored and shared. When forces are deployed, Airbus has the solutions as well, with helicopters, airlifters that are increasingly connected in the battlefield.

The capabilities of Airbus are highlighted at Eurosatory 2022

These solutions are be showcased at Eurosatory 2022, the international defence and security exhibition, which takes place at the Villepinte Exhibition Centre near Paris from June 13 to 17. Airbus will be present in Hall 5A, exhibit stand # C181.

Preparing, training…and defending against cyber attacks

In response to cyber-attacks that have become a daily threat and are increasingly sophisticated, Airbus Defence and Space has developed the MTLID defensive cyber warfare system to secure military networks and protect data. It has monitoring, warning, detection and response capabilities that identify the origin, target, criticality and impact of such attacks, enabling them to be countered with a suitable response plan.

A key to defending against cyber-attacks is being ready for these threats through preparation and training. The CyberRange advanced simulation solution from Airbus CyberSecurity easily models information technology (IT) systems and operational technology (OT) systems with of 10s or 100s of machines and simulate realistic scenarios including real cyber-attacks. CyberRange is used by administrators, integrators, testers, trainers and others to design virtualised or hybrid networks, emulate unit activities such as communications between two machines or to launch complex scenarios reproducing a realistic activity.

A portfolio of unmanned airborne platforms

Acquiring relevant information from secure sources to supply command and combat systems is vital, and Airbus has a varied portfolio of unmanned airborne resources to meet this need.

The versatile, high-endurance Aliaca unmanned aerial system (UAS) enables missions from three to six hours to be conducted over ranges of 50 to 100 km, and is perfectly adapted to sensitive missions in severe environmental conditions with gyro-stabilized EO/IR payloads. Launched by catapult, Aliaca concludes its flight by landing automatically using a dedicated net landing solution. This UAS utilises a powerful, yet silent, electric motor, and also exists in a version with thermal propulsion. The French Navy is receiving 11 Aliaca systems (incorporating 22 of the UAS), with deliveries initiated in 2021.

Also offered by Airbus is the compact and discrete VSR700 unmanned helicopter, which can perform a broad range of missions ranging from cargo to armed reconnaissance at sea and over land. It offers the best balance of payload capability, endurance, and operational costs.

Interoperable intelligence and secure communications

Dependable intelligence gives commanders the insights to make the right decisions at the right time. For more than 30 years, Airbus has delivered actionable interoperable intelligence that enables responses at greater speed and with greater certainty. With proprietary access to the world’s leading satellite constellations – including Pléiades Neo, which has an optical resolution of 30 cm – Airbus supplies sustainable satellite imagery and data solutions.

The Secure Communications business of Airbus Defence and Space specializes in mission-critical voice and high-speed data communications on land, at sea and in the air. Bringing together the most comprehensive satellite communications bandwidth with best-in-class capabilities for network services and solutions, the division has proven experience and expertise in managing everything from network operations to in-field support services and training means.

Multi-Domain Combat Cloud

Among the most critical challenges faced in a congested and contested battlefield is the ability to connect and securely communicate across all domains.

To meet this challenge, Airbus is developing new technologies and solutions that provide decentralised, cyber-resilient, collaborative information networks across the air, land, sea, space and cyber domains using cloud-based technologies.

The resulting Multi-Domain Combat Cloud (MDCC) enhances defence power through information superiority, enables collaborative combat with manned and unmanned teaming assets across all domains under human supervision, making military operations more efficient and effective.

Airbus’ MDCC covers all domains: air (connecting assets for next-generation air power with the Future Combat Air System), land (a connectable Land Combat Cloud based on an intelligent open service architecture), sea (smart, seamless and secure ship-to-shore, ship-to-ship and inter-domain connectivity), space (dependable, resilient satellite communications and space-based intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance), and cyber (end-to-end dynamic protection and advanced cyber capabilities).

Airbus Helicopters in action for intervention and support

For intervention on the battlefield, rotorcraft solutions from Airbus Helicopters include the H160M. As a true multi-mission platform, the H160M is weaponised for light attack operations, and can quickly be reconfigured for duties that range from commando infiltration to air intercept, fire support, anti-ship warfare, along with search and rescue operations.

In scenarios requiring troop transport, air support and logistics, Airbus’ H225M is a true multi-purpose and versatile asset, operating from both ships and land with an all-weather capability supported by night vision goggle compatibility. The helicopter’s outstanding 700 NM range can be extended with air-to-air or hover in-flight refuelling capabilities.

Responding to evolving conditions in the battlespace

On land, at sea, in the atmosphere and into space, Airbus’ digital expertise enhances the speed, agility and mission effectiveness of command and control for systems, sensors, aircraft and deployed forces.

As timely mission planning and execution is more essential than ever on the battlefield, the solutions from Airbus ensure agile response, along with improved situational awareness and ever faster decision-making.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.945544958114624}",neutral,0.945544958114624,0

"The World's Largest Passenger Aircraft, the Airbus A380, Is Back - Popular Mechanics","Wed, 29 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHVsYXJtZWNoYW5pY3MuY29tL2ZsaWdodC9haXJsaW5lcy9hNDA0NjExNTEvYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtd2lsbC1mbHktYWdhaW4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After grounding the Airbus A380 in “deep storage” in 2020, German airliner Lufthansa plans to bring the long-haul aircraft back next year.

Lufthansa had been selling off the excess planes, but is now turning to them as a solution for high travel demand.

Delayed aircraft deliveries are a reason to put the A380 back in service.

After the COVID-19 pandemic paused air travel in 2020, Lufthansa parked 14 Airbus A380 jumbo aircraft in Spain and France for long-term “deep storage.” The German airliner eventually sold off six of these huge planes, considered the world’s largest passenger aircraft. But now we can expect at least some of the remaining eight to make a comeback; The airline announced Airbus A380s will return to the fleet in summer 2023.

“We decided today to put the A380, which continues to enjoy great popularity, back into service at Lufthansa in summer 2023,” the company’s executive board announced in a news release on Monday.

✈️ You love badass planes. So do we. Let’s nerd out over them together—join Pop Mech Pro.

At 329 feet long and 78 feet high, the A380 is truly huge, and Lufthansa is taking advantage of the space inside. It has configured the A380 to seat 509 passengers in a 3-4-3 setup in economy class. With such a large passenger load, the airline obviously believes the cost of operating the plane will be offset by demand.

And Lufthansa isn’t the only airline still on the superjumbo bandwagon. CNN reports that Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Qantas, Qatar Airways, Korean Air, All Nippon Airways, and British Airways all still fly the A380. British Airways had stopped using the A380 in March 2020, but in October 2021.

Lufthansa’s return to the A380 comes as a “response to the steep rise in customer demand and the delayed delivery of ordered aircraft,” the executive board says. It’s likely that Lufthansa is referencing the Boeing 777X delivery delay, now slated for 2025.



While Lufthansa is still assessing how many of the eight aircraft will make a return and exactly which destinations the airline will fly to, the long-haul aircraft is part of a trend in reshaping airlines. In addition to reenergizing the A380, the Lufthansa board says it will also modernize the fleet in the next three years with 50 new models of the Airbus A350, Boeing 787, and Boeing 777-9 long-haul designs, along with 60 new Airbus A320 and A321s.

Emirates has been the leader in A380 use worldwide, with over 100 planes in the airline’s quiver. In 2019, Emirates canceled an A380 order of 39 planes, leading Lufthansa to cease production of the plane, although it still delivered its final model to Emirates in 2021 to fulfill previous orders. Then came the 2020 pandemic, which made oversized aircraft superfluous for travel. The grounding of the plane led to a sell-off for the German airline.

The company will showcase its cybersecurity solutions at the International Cybersecurity Forum (FIC) from 7th to 9th June 2022 in Lille (France).

With the exponential cyber threats, along with the increasing digitalisation and connectivity of its products and systems, cybersecurity has become a strategic and pivotal component of Airbus’ development and future. The company has therefore undertaken a series of actions and investments to further develop and strengthen its cybersecurity capabilities and expertise, ensuring the best possible protection for the company, its ecosystem, and its customers.

Thus, Airbus has decided to combine its existing Company-wide cybersecurity services activities in a single organisation which will go live on 1st July 2022. The new organisation, which will focus on cybersecurity and safety services especially in the industrial sector, will bring together more than 1,000 experts based in France, Germany, the UK and Spain. It will provide a unique global service offering to protect the Group and meet the needs of national authorities and commercial customers including critical infrastructures.

Besides these services activities, cybersecurity teams dedicated to large projects will develop further their expertise and business for defence and space customers and programmes. 400 experts will contribute to major integration projects in France, Germany, UK and Spain around high-level technologies such as cyber defence and cryptography.

Furthermore, Airbus has recently acquired DSI, a Germany-based company certified by the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) that provides cryptography and communication systems for the space, airborne, naval and land sectors.

For its cybersecurity products, Airbus has just launched a double-digit million euros investment plan - mostly focused on R&D activities - in its Stormshield subsidiary. The company, which gathers 400 experts and offers data, endpoint and network security solutions will increase the capabilities and performance of its product lines and accelerate the development of its international activities.

Within a fast-paced sector where the turnover of employees is high, Airbus continues to invest in talents, having recruited several hundred cybersecurity experts in recent years and foresees an increasing need of cyber skills at all levels. Among many initiatives in this domain, Airbus has just launched its own diploma in cybersecurity. The first 25 students will start their degree-level training programme in cybersecurity in September 2022.

To discover Airbus’ capabilities, meet us at the FIC - Stand F22.

The first will return to service in July for twice weekly service through October. The airline took delivery of its third and final A380 mid-pandemic and placed the aircraft directly into storage. No date has yet been set for the sunset orange livery’s introduction to passenger service.

Qantas brought forward the A380’s initial return to its fleet thanks to the faster than anticipated recovery in travel demand. Currently the airline has four active A380s with two more in Abu Dhabi for maintenance. Four of the five still in storage will return to service eventually, while one of those will join VH-OQF in the scrap heap.

Lufthansa has said it will return at least a portion of its 14 A380s to service for summer 2023. The airline has not yet said how many aircraft will return, nor which routes they will fly.

Korean Air recently reactivated two A380s and will recall a third from storage before the end of the year.

"Airbus flies new passenger airplane aimed at 'long, thin' routes - The Register","Fri, 17 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA2LzE3L2FpcmJ1c19hMzIxeGxyX2ZpcnN0X2ZsaWdodC_SAUdodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vQU1QLzIwMjIvMDYvMTcvYWlyYnVzX2EzMjF4bHJfZmlyc3RfZmxpZ2h0Lw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European aviation giant Airbus this week successfully flew a new ""long, thin"" passenger airplane that the world's airlines think could let them open new routes.

The plane is called the ""A321XLR"" and is the newest member of the single-aisle, twinjet, A320 family.

The ""XLR"" is the important part of the name because it stands for ""Extra Long Range"" – 4,700NM (8,700km) to be precise – a capability that means the plane can fly 11-hour hops and trips like New York to Rome, London to Delhi, or Sydney to Tokyo.

Today such routes are usually served by wide-body aircraft. The A321XLR will make them possible in a fuel-sipping single aisle 200-seater that can use shortish runways, and which Airbus insists offers passengers all the comforts of a wide-body interior.

Airbus asserts the A321XLR will be cheaper to operate than wide bodies on such routes. The plane maker is also suggesting the A321XLR's range could allow long distance flights between smaller cities, doing away with unloved stopovers at big hub airports.

Such long distance routes are sometimes described as ""thin"" – aviation jargon for modest passenger demand. Long and thin routes are very scarce today.

Airbus wants to change that and has 515 advance orders for the A321XLR on its books to attest to airlines' enthusiasm for the idea.

Which brings us to Wednesday when the first A321XLR took to the skies and, according to Airbus, spent four hours and 35 minutes aloft conducting various tests.

That the plane returned safely suggests those tests went tolerably well, and its planned 2024 commercial debut remains within reach.

In 2018 The Register covered the debut of the A321LR, which boasts a mere nine-hour flying time and 7,400km range. Readers expressed a mixture of admiration for the low fares the plane could create, plus misgivings about spending so much time in a small aircraft.

Does the A321XLR's stretched range stretch the friendship to breaking point? Feel free to hit the comments and let us know. ®","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998880624771118}",neutral,0.9998880624771118,0

The five-bladed helicopters will be operated by the Cypriot National Guard.

“The implementation of this agreement will provide the National Guard with a cost-effective and high-performance helicopter solution that satisfies the operational requirements set by the General Staff and addresses many of the future challenges of light attack helicopter fleets. Able to operate in very demanding environments, the H145M will enhance the National Guard’s day and night capabilities in delivering rapid response, fire power and precision, providing effective combat support, and acquiring critical information,” said Andreas P. Louka, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Cyprus.

“The helicopter solution conceived by the National Guard/Air Force Command would not have materialised without Airbus’ strong commitment to customer focus and satisfaction. For this reason, I thank Airbus Helicopters for their excellent cooperation and commitment to this project and I am deeply satisfied because this contract marks the initiation of a long-term relationship with Airbus, a corporation with a reputation in safety, reliability and highest production standards,” he added.

""We would like to thank the Government of Cyprus for the trust they are placing in the H145M which is becoming the reference multi-role light attack helicopter on the market,” said Olivier Michalon, Executive Vice President Global Business at Airbus Helicopters. “Operators can use it for tactical air transport, deployment of crisis response forces, fire support, armed reconnaissance as well as the evacuation of wounded or the liberation of hostages. There are now five different customers for the H145M in Europe, adding to the interoperability of armed forces on the continent,” he added. “We see a strong interest for the H145M across the world and we have several ongoing campaigns, which is very promising for this aircraft.”

The H145M is a multi-role light utility military helicopter. Derived from the civil H145, the latest version of the H145M features a new, innovative five-bladed rotor that increases the helicopter's payload by 150 kg. The design of the new bearingless main rotor also simplifies maintenance operations.

Equipped with the Airbus HForce weapons system the H145M can be operated as a light attack helicopter. The weapons range includes guns, rockets and missiles are currently being integrated. Combined with Manned-Unmanned Teaming capabilities and integration into networked combat, its bandwidth makes it the most performant helicopter in its class.

The H145 was developed as a civil model for day and night operations and in the most adverse conditions. It is used by armed forces, police and rescue teams all over the world. It is powered by two powerful Safran Helicopter Engines Arriel 2E turbines, controlled by the FADEC (full authority digital engine control) system. In addition, the helicopter is equipped with the Helionix digital avionics suite and thus offers not only innovative flight data management but also a powerful 4-axis autopilot, which considerably reduces the pilots' workload in their missions. Its particularly low noise emissions make the H145 the quietest helicopter in its class.

The H145M is already in service in Hungary (20), Germany (15), Serbia (9), Thailand (5) and Luxembourg (2). The US Army operates a fleet of more than 460 locally built civil helicopters of the H145 family under the name UH-72 Lakota.

Qantas and Airbus joint investment to kickstart Australian biofuels industry - Airbus,"Sun, 19 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wNi1xYW50YXMtYW5kLWFpcmJ1cy1qb2ludC1pbnZlc3RtZW50LXRvLWtpY2tzdGFydC1hdXN0cmFsaWFuLWJpb2Z1ZWxz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Doha, 19 June 2022 - The Qantas Group and Airbus will invest up to US$200 million to accelerate the establishment of a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry in Australia in a landmark agreement.

The Australian Sustainable Aviation FuelPartnership was signed in Doha today by Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce and Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury ahead of the IATA AGM.

Due to the lack of a local commercial-scale SAF industry, Australia is currently exporting millions of tonnes of feedstock every year, such as canola and animal tallow to be made into SAF in other countries.

The Qantas Group, which has committed to using 10 per cent SAF in its overall fuel mix by 2030, is sourcing SAF overseas, including 15 percent of its fuel use out of London currently and 20 million litres each year for flights from Los Angeles and San Francisco to Australia from 2025.

Sustainable fuels cut greenhouse gas emissions by around 80 per cent compared to traditional kerosene and are the most significant tool airlines currently have to reduce their impact on the environment – particularly given they can be used in today’s engines with no modifications.

The Qantas and Airbus partnership will provide funding for locally developed and produced SAF and feedstock initiatives. Projects will have to be commercially viable and meet a strict set of criteria around environmental sustainability.

Airbus and Qantas agreed to work together on the sustainability initiative part of the airline’s recently announced orders. These include the A350-1000 to operate ‘Project Sunrise’ non-stop flights from Australia to New York and London and the selection of the A220 and A321XLR under the carrier’s ‘Project Winton’ domestic fleet renewal, as well as lower emission aircraft for its subsidiary Jetstar.

The new fleet will offer a significant reduction in fuel consumption and carbon emissions of up to 25% from day one and are all already certified for operation using 50% SAF.

The partnership is initially for five years with options to extend the duration. Qantas’ financial contribution to the Australian Sustainable Aviation Fuel Partnership includes AU$50 million previously committed to research and development of SAF in Australia.

Pratt and Whitney, whose GTF engines were recently selected by Qantas for their new A220 and A320neo family aircraft, is also contributing to the venture. The company supports greater use of cleaner, alternative fuels including SAF, while continually advancing the efficiency of aircraft propulsion technology.

Qantas has started a process of talking to its major corporate customers about their interest in accessing SAF offsets for their organisation’s flying. This input is shaping the design of a programme that could also be extended to individuals in an expansion of the existing offsetting programme Qantas already has in place. This new program is expected to launch later this calendar year.

Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce said the investment would accelerate the development of SAF in Australia, creating value for shareholders, while creating jobs and reducing the nation’s dependence on imported fuels.

“The use of SAF is increasing globally as governments and industry work together to find ways to decarbonise the aviation sector. Without swift action, Australia is at risk of being left behind,” Mr Joyce said. “With this investment, Qantas and Airbus are putting our money where our mouth is and betting on the innovation and ingenuity of Australian industry.”

“Aviation is an irreplaceable industry, especially for a country the size of Australia, and one that’s located so far away from so much of the world. Future generations are relying on us to get this right so they too can benefit from air travel.”

“This investment will help kickstart a local biofuels industry in Australia and hopefully encourage additional investment from governments and other businesses and build more momentum for the industry as a whole.”

“It makes a lot of sense for us to put equity into an industry that we will be the biggest customer of. We’re calling on other companies and producers to come forward with their biofuel projects. In many cases, this funding will be the difference between some of these projects getting off the ground.""

“The aviation industry also needs the right policy settings in place to ensure the cost of SAF comes down over time so that the cost of air travel doesn’t rise. We’ve had some encouraging discussions with the incoming Australian Government given their strong focus on emissions reduction and look forward to that progressing.”

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said: “Ensuring a sustainable future for our industry has become the priority for Airbus and we are taking up this challenge with partners across the world and from across all sectors.”

“The increased use of sustainable aviation fuels will be a key driver to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. But we can’t do this without viable industrial systems to produce and commercialise these energy sources at affordable rates and near to key hubs around the world. This is especially true for a country like Australia, which is geographically distant and highly reliant on aviation to remain connected both domestically and internationally.”

“The agreement we are signing with Qantas today reflects the new level of partnership between our two companies and our firmly shared commitment to act as catalysts of change to ensure a bright future for our industry.”

Editor’s notes

Qantas Group commitment to sustainability:

In 2019, Qantas was the second airline in the world to commit to net zero emissions by 2050.

The Qantas Group Climate Action Plan <LINK> , released in March 2022, commits the airline group to an interim target of 25% emissions reduction and 10% SAF use in the fuel mix by 2030 and 60 per cent SAF use by 2050.

As part of its fleet replacement programme announced in May, the Qantas Group confirmed purchase rights to 94 A321XLR and A220 aircraft, which will reduce emissions by up to 25% over traditional fossil fuels.

The Qantas Group’s landmark Project Sunrise programme, which will use A350s to travel non-stop initially between Sydney and London and Sydney and New York, will be carbon neutral from day one.

Qantas’ Fly Carbon Neutral programme is one of the largest airline offsetting programmes in the world, with a focus on high integrity projects in Australia and overseas. More than 10 percent of passengers elected to “tick the box” to offset flights.

Offsetting is a key tool in Qantas’ decarbonisation efforts, particularly while alternative aircraft fuel technology is still many years away.

The Qantas Green Tier, launched earlier this year, allows the airline’s 14 million Frequent Flyers to access rewards for being more sustainable when they travel and at home.

Airbus climate action plan

Key pillars of the manufacturer’s climate action plan focus on fleet replacement with new fuel-efficient aircraft, the increased use of sustainable aviation fuels, optimised air traffic management and ultimately the delivery of zero-emission aircraft by 2035.

The Airbus aircraft selected by Qantas already deliver a reduction in fuel consumption of between up to 25% compared with previous generation aircraft.

All current Airbus commercial aircraft are already certified to fly with up to 50% SAF.

Since 2008, Airbus has acted as an important catalyst in the certification process, demonstration flights, partnerships, and policy advocacy of SAF.

In 2021 the manufacturer performed its first test flight using 100% SAF.

Airbus targets approval for the 100% use of SAF on all its current commercial aircraft by 2030.

Airbus is also investing in the development of zero emission aircraft that will be powered by hydrogen with first delivery targeted in 2035.

Other studies include the potential use of synthetic fuels that will combine carbon feedstocks with renewable hydrogen.

Airbus is fully committed to playing a leading role in the decarbonisation of the aviation sector and industry goals to achieve carbon-neutrality by 2050.

With the first delivery due in 2026, these new aircraft will enhance and position the Spanish Air Force fighter fleet among its NATO allies with the most modern fighter jet developed in Europe, as well as securing industrial activity through to 2030.

‘This additional order reinforces Spain’s commitment not only towards the Eurofighter but also to its development and industrial environment. I would like to thank the customer for its firm position with respect to European defence at a time when it is needed most,” said Mike Schoellhorn, CEO of Airbus Defence and Space.

The acquisition, valued at € 2.043 billion, was approved by Spain’s Council of Ministers on 14 December 2021 and includes the aircraft, engines, a simulator and the necessary support services.

In service with Spain since 2003, the country’s air force operates the Eurofighter from the air bases of Morón (11th Wing) and Albacete (14th Wing), securing Spain’s territory and playing a key role at the heart of NATO in different Air Policing missions in the Baltics and more recently the Black Sea. With the arrival of these new aircraft, Spain will also equip a third base with Eurofighter jets, namely Gando on the Canary Islands, which is home to the 46th Wing.

The Spanish Eurofighter is assembled, tested and delivered at the Airbus Getafe site (Spain) and its industrial footprint translates into more than 20,000 direct and indirect jobs in Spain alone. The main national defence and technological companies are involved in the manufacturing process. Airbus has also been working at Getafe in coordination with the Armament and Experimental Logistics Centre (CLAEX) of the Spanish Air Force to make various modifications such as the implementation of the new CM02+ software package for the Tranche 1 Eurofighters. A major tactical improvement offered by this software is the new capacity for automatic targeting of air-to-surface weapons following integration of the Litening-III targeting pod. Further air-to-air and air-to-surface capabilities have also been introduced, along with improvements to the communications systems.

Eurofighter is Europe’s largest defence programme, involving the four core nations of the United Kingdom, Spain, Germany and Italy. In addition to its technological capabilities, it secures more than 100,000 jobs in Europe. To date, the Eurofighter programme has logged 681 aircraft orders to 9 nations around the globe.

Airbus delivers third radar for Copernicus´ Sentinel-1 mission with a world premiere - Airbus,"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wNi1haXJidXMtZGVsaXZlcnMtdGhpcmQtcmFkYXItZm9yLWNvcGVybmljdXMtc2VudGluZWwtMS1taXNzaW9uLXdpdGjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New separation mechanism will help to avoid space debris

Sentinel-1 radars scan our planet and its environment for Europe’s citizens

Friedrichshafen, 21 June 2022 – Airbus has finished the third instrument for the Sentinel-1 satellite series. It features a world premiere of a new separation mechanism which will help avoid space debris. The C-band radar for the Copernicus Sentinel-1C satellite, is now on its way to “meet” its spacecraft at Thales Alenia Space facilities in Rome, Italy, where it will undergo integration and testing. The satellite is scheduled for launchin the first half of 2023.

The C-band radar beam the instrument produces can determine changes in the Earth’s surface with an accuracy of a few millimetres, supplying imagery for maritime and land monitoring, emergency response, climate change and security. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has the advantage of operating at wavelengths not impeded by cloud cover or a lack of illumination and can acquire data over a site during the day or night in all weather conditions. Having a primary operational mode over land and another over open ocean allows pre-programmed operation. Typically a radar image is acquired over a wide swath (250 km) with high geometric (typically 5m by 20m) resolution.

Largely identical to its two predecessors, the new radar instrument for Sentinel-1C has one special feature, an invention patented by Airbus that is being used for the first time. It features soldered joints installed at the main connection points to the satellite, which melt when exposed to strong heating and separate the radar antenna from the satellite platform. Both parts are then separately exposed to the full frictional heat and burn up earlier and faster, on re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere at the end of the satellite´s 7.25 years lifetime. As a result the Airbus invention makes a contribution to avoiding space debris and protecting the environment in orbit. The 12.3 m x 0.9 m radar was built and tested at Friedrichshafen (Germany), with the Electronics Subsystem made in Portsmouth (UK). The T/R modules (Transmit & Receive) and the Front End Electronics were developed and produced by Thales Alenia Space to Airbus specifications.

Since April 2014 the Sentinel-1 mission has been providing all-weather, round-the-clock imagery for Copernicus, the world largest environment programme, led by Europe. Copernicus is a joint programme of the European Commission (EC) and the European Space Agency (ESA). Up to the end of May 2022, more than 620,000 users had more than 39 million Sentinel-1 products equivalent to 48 million gigabytes of data.

Airbus' successful ILA Berlin air show: a major Eurofighter order and new sustainability agreements - Airbus,"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLTA2LWFpcmJ1cy1zdWNjZXNzZnVsLWlsYS1iZXJsaW4tYWlyLXNob3ctYS1tYWpvci1ldXJvZmlnaHRlci1vcmRlci1hbmQtbmV30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus made headlines during this week’s ILA Berlin with key developments spanning the company’s military, civil, air mobility and cybersecurity businesses – led by a landmark contract for Spain’s acquisition of 20 latest-generation Eurofighter combat aircraft.

ILA Berlin was the first major European air show since 2019, and this event enabled Airbus to underscore how it pioneers sustainable aerospace for a safe and united world. It had a full range of aircraft on static display and in the flight demonstrations, as well as at the indoor exhibits at Berlin ExpoCenter Airport.

Topping the ILA Berlin news was Spain’s order for a fleet of E-Scan (electronically scanned) radar-equipped Eurofighters to replace F-18s operated by the Spanish Air Force from Gando Air Base on the Canary Islands. With deliveries to begin in 2026, these new single- and twin-seat combat aircraft will increase the Spanish Air Force’s overall inventory to 90 Eurofighters, positioning it among NATO allies with the most modern fighter jet developed in Europe.

Initiatives, partnerships for sustainability and mobility

Six other announcements at ILA Berlin spotlighted Airbus’ efforts to move the aviation industry’s goals forward for aviation sustainability and advanced air mobility, with the company undertaking an increasingly diverse range of initiatives and lining up key partnerships.

This includes Airbus support for the German Air Force’s start-up of future flight trials using A400M multi-role airlifters powered by up to 50 percent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Looking further ahead, the goal is to enable the German Air Force’s entire fleet of Airbus-built aircraft – from airlifters and VIP transports to fighter jets – to operate on SAF, which is a proven alternative fuel that can reduce life-cycle CO2 emissions by up to 85 percent compared to conventional fuel.

In addition to supporting such near-term activities at the national level, Airbus has embarked on a long-term roadmap towards achieving 100 percent SAF readiness and certification for the various countries operating A400Ms.

Airbus’ A400M is the most advanced, proven and certified airlifter available today; its operators include the German Air Force, with one of this military services’ aircraft on display at the 2022 Berlin Air show

A world’s first helicopter flight with sustainable aviation fuel

Another development announced during ILA Berlin was the first ever helicopter flight performed with 100 percent SAF that powered both Safran Makila 2 engines on an H225 rotorcraft. Such tests are expected to continue on other helicopter types with different fuel and engine architectures, with a view to certifying the use of 100 percent SAF by 2030.

In focusing on the ground segment aspect of future aviation sustainability, Airbus and the Linde industrial gases and engineering company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to develop hydrogen infrastructure at airports worldwide. They will define and launch pilot projects at several airports from early 2023 onwards, while also analysing the potential of Power-to-Liquid fuels - a type of SAF made from the synthetically-produced liquid hydrocarbon through the conversion of renewable electricity.

Exhibited at the ILA Berlin air show is the H225 – Airbus’ latest member of its proven Super Puma/Cougar family, which has accumulated more than 5.8 million flight hours during operations around the world

Driving the sustainable deployment of advanced air mobility solutions

Also at ILA Berlin, Airbus and Munich Airport International signed an MoU to start marketing turnkey solutions for cities and regions interested in developing advanced air mobility (AAM) ecosystems globally. The successful integration of different AAM elements – including Airbus’ CityAirbus NextGen electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft – requires a strong cooperation between global and local stakeholders combining key competencies, including partners such as Munich Airport.

Additionally, Airbus unveiled a partnership with KLK Motorsport and Modell- und Formenbau Blasius Gerg GmbH to design, develop and manufacture CityAirbus NextGen’s rear structure. They will work together to develop an ultra-lightweight rear fuselage based on high-end composite solutions and components – mutually benefitting from each of their competencies in design engineering and manufacturing processes.

Airbus’ major presence at the ILA Berlin air show includes its primary exhibit stand in Hall 4, with such scale models as the ZEROe hybrid-hydrogen aircraft, CityAirbus NextGen multicopter, C295 Flight Test Bed 2 for Clean Sky 2 and A321XLR; along with the H160M, H225M and H145M helicopters; as well as Eurostar Neo and OneWeb satellites

An A321LR delivery to the German armed forces

A delivery ceremony at ILA Berlin marked the handover of the first of two A321LR (Long Range) aircraft for the German armed forces. It was reconfigured from the commercial version by Lufthansa Technik AG for flexible troop and passenger transport – as well as parliamentary flight operations – on short-, medium- and long-haul routes. Lufthansa Technik also made preparations for the aircraft’s medical evacuation role, which will expand its scope of operations to include the transport of wounded, injured and ill passengers as a flying intensive care unit.

""Together with our partner Lufthansa Technik, we have worked to ensure this aircraft meets all expectations,"" explained Guillaume Faury, the Chief Executive Officer of Airbus. ""The A321LR not only flies longer routes than ever, it also delivers a 20 percent reduction in CO2 emissions compared to previous-generation aircraft and is certified to run on 50 percent sustainable aviation fuels, which can reduce emissions even further.""

Lufthansa Technik AG, as prime contractor, today handed over the first of two Airbus A321LR (Long Range) troop transports to the German armed forces at the ILA Berlin airshow. In the presence of Lufthansa Technik COO Soeren Stark and Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury, the State Secretary in the German Ministry of Defense, Benedikt Zimmer, and the German Air Chief, Lieutenant General Ingo Gerhartz, formally took delivery of the aircraft with the tactical registration 15+10.

Six H145Ms ordered for the Cypriot National Guard

With the H145M battlefield support helicopter displayed at ILA Berlin, the air show was a highly appropriate venue for Airbus’ contract announcement for six of these rotorcraft to be operated by the Cypriot National Guard. The order, from the Government of Cyprus, is for the H145M version with a six-blade main rotor – and includes options for another six.

The agreement will provide the Cypriot National Guard with a cost-effective and high-performance helicopter that addresses many of the future challenges for light attack helicopter fleets, delivering rapid response, firepower and precision, along with providing effective combat support and acquiring critical information.

Derived from the civilian H145, the latest version of Airbus Helicopters’ H145M features a new, innovative five-blade main rotor that increases the rotorcraft’s payload by 150 kg., with its bearingless design simplifying maintenance operations.

An innovation hub for cybersecurity and artificial intelligence

A key step in Airbus’ strategy to continue strengthening its cybersecurity capabilities and expertise was taken at ILA Berlin through an MoU signing with the CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security. This agreement will lead to the opening of a center of excellence for cybersecurity and trustworthy artificial intelligence in Saarland, Germany.

To be located at the CISPA Innovation Campus, the ""CISPA-Airbus Digital Innovation Hub"" will start operations in 2022. The intention is to grow its operation to approximately 100 experts within the next three years – ultimately expanding to more than 500 experts.

Boeing and Airbus hit as supply chain woes hamper aircraft production - theloadstar.com,"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbG9hZHN0YXIuY29tL2JvZWluZy1hbmQtYWlyYnVzLWhpdC1hcy1zdXBwbHktY2hhaW4td29lcy1oYW1wZXItYWlyY3JhZnQtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Ian Putzger in Toronto 17/06/2022

For ten days in May, Boeing all but halted production of its 737 MAX, the Wall Street Journal reported this month, citing unidentified sources who attributed the disruption to supply chain snarls.

In the past, Boeing would move planes down the assembly line and install the missing parts afterwards. This time it paused aircraft on the line.

Boeing has a host of undelivered 737 MAXs and 787s on its hands, the latter owing to inspections and repairs after small cracks were found in structural joints, which virtually stopped 787 handovers since late 2020.

In April, Boeing reported that 737 MAX production and deliveries were affected by the shortage of a particular wiring connector.

Rival Airbus is not having a smooth ride, either. The number of jets it delivered in May was 6% lower than a year ago.

This was not great news for Airbus management, which is aiming to turn out 45 planes in its A320 family every month this year, with a view to ramping production up to 65 a month by mid-2023 and between 70 and 75 by 2024. Observers have called these targets ambitious. In February, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury had said ramping up narrowbody output was at “the heart of our priorities”.

However, problems stretch throughout aviation supply chains. In February, aerospace and defence conglomerate Raytheon Technologies announced that its Pratt & Whitney unit might not ship some 70 engines to Airbus because of casting shortages.

According to some experts, the aerospace supply chain is riddled with parts shortages and delays. The impact of Covid-19 revealed deep vulnerabilities and led to casualties and lay-offs, as more than half the global commercial airline fleet was grounded and airlines slashed costs.

Now, the surviving suppliers are trying to handle increased demand with fewer staff and engineers already in short supply well before the pandemic. Carriers have come to rely increasingly on single-source vendors, as it’s time-consuming to get new vendors qualified.

Aviation companies that specialise in converting passenger planes to all-cargo configuration have been in overdrive, with order slots for some types booked well into 2025. Aeronautical Engineers (AEI), which performs predominantly B737 conversions, has felt the impact of supply chain bumps, but these have not led to serious results, reported Bob Convey,VP sales and marketing.

“We felt it mainly in delays in lead times and the cost impact,” he said.

Obtaining parts has not been a problem, but delays in smoke detector deliveries are an issue, Mr Convey noted, adding: “It’s a challenge. We need to ship earlier.”

AEI is feeling the supply chain strain in its own shipping requirements. Freighter conversion kits are assembled in the US, including the supply to its facility in China. Airfreight capacity between the two areas is still very low, as belly lift has not returned to pre-pandemic levels and wait times for lift can be long, Mr Convey said.

He does not expect a rapid improvement there.

“It’s still going to take another year before full flying to China is restored,” he said.

Airbus and Boeing are hoping for much faster progress in coming to grips with their supply chain issues.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9994388222694397}",negative,0.9994388222694397,-1

"Flight of the navigator – the Airbus quest to build, run its own multi-market 5G network - RCR Wireless News","Fri, 17 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJjcndpcmVsZXNzLmNvbS8yMDIyMDYxNy81Zy9haXJidXMtNWctZmxpZ2h0LW9mLWZhbmN5LWhvdy10by1idWlsZC1hbmQtbWFuYWdlLWEtbXVsdGktbWFya2V0LXByaXZhdGUtNWctbmV0d29ya9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European aviation and aerospace firm Airbus effectively headlined the latest Private Networks Forum (PNF), hosted by RCR Wireless and Enterprise IoT Insights, in May, as the premier (the first, at least) enterprise on the schedule. Fresh from a panel with Intel, Qualcomm, and Telefónica, which explained the new industrial scissor movement to tailor enterprises with new layers of 5G and Wi-Fi, the company was back to present its own fittings.

Patrick Castagnino, in charge of connectivity and strategy innovation for digital aviation at Airbus, explained the different applications, making clear Wi-Fi remains strategically important for aviation services, but that dedicated 4G and 5G bring new possibilities. He said: “Wi-Fi is not powerful enough or performant enough. Only cellular works inside the aircraft; [only cellular] connects everywhere, and any worker – across multiple manufacturing campuses.”

It was a carry-over from the previous session, which said the same, but worked as an essential start-point for the Airbus tale, too – just because the path to digital transformation for Airbus, like for others in the aviation game, vaults beyond existing networking infrastructure. “We started with a proof-of-concept [in Toulouse] four years ago with 4G, for multiple reasons – firstly to combine Wi-Fi and cellular,” said Castagnino.

The motivation to test out cellular was to raise security and performance in its connectivity estate, he said – “compared to Wi-Fi”. It was not, he made clear, just for the sake of it. “It depends on the use case. We use Wi-Fi in static mode and 4G/5G in other use cases – when we need full connectivity and roaming across the site… [But] with a static environment or machine, Wi-Fi is [already]l very well adapted, [and] we are deploying Wi-Fi 6 [as well].”

The quotes are taken from across the PNF presentation. He went on: “We are using them in combination – the best tech for our needs, [every time]. 4G/5G [ensures] continuity of service [when roaming between access points]… [and is] key for mission critical comms, as well.” Mobility, coverage, performance, in other words; with Wi-Fi ever more adept at serving familiar point solutions, in factories and airports, other indoor enterprise venues.

A slide late on (see image) compared downlink rates for private 4G and Wi-Fi in a 150 square-metre hangar, populated at any time with up to 10 aeroplanes; it said 4G is steady at 55-66 Mbps in and around the aircraft – going from outside, under the wheel, into the cargo hold and control room – while Wi-Fi vacillates between 1 Mbps and 12 Mbps, tops. “Private 4G is much better than Wi-Fi,” he said, pointing to Wi-Fi bounce in metal rooms and vehicles.

The presentation ran through key use cases for the airline industry, as Airbus has propped them up over the past few years on Ericsson networking gear across multiple sites (seven) in both Toulouse (4G, going to 5G NSA) and Hamburg (5G NSA), in France and Germany, and is to replicate in Spain and the UK “in the next months”. Castagnino said his company’s private 5G pursuits are predicated on the fact these markets are difficult to rationalise with public network infrastructure.

“The main challenge [is] regulation and spectrum,” he said. It is a problem for private network deployments too, just because, in the case of France and Germany, where Airbus has focused its initial efforts, local regulators have made spectrum available at 2.6 GHz (Band 38) and 3.7 GHz (Band 43), respectively. The workaround has been to develop a dual core, managed centrally in France. “It was a big challenge to harmonise our core network,” he explained.

But the result is the right one, he added. “That’s how we will manage the full European campus.” The reference, here, is to centralised management of multiple sites across Europe, including the forthcoming rollouts. SA upgrades will follow the geographic expansion; the upgrade path is less urgent, he noted, because 4G works very well. “Why [are we still using] still 4G? Because 4G is fully adapted to 95 percent of our needs,” he reasoned.

Airbus’ decision to go it alone, separately from traditional telco operators, is down to security, which remains the north star for digital change in just about every Industry 4.0 scenario. “The data has to be stored on our campus without external connectivity. That is one of the main reasons for selecting private networks.” The only data flowing out of is network data, for network control; all the industrial data remains locked into the edge networks.

But back to the use cases, which are the things on Castagnino’s mind, actually. Private cellular is being used already in Toulouse and Hamburg for site surveillance, flight-to-ground data offloads (“95 percent of the volume”), quality inspections, automated guided vehicles (AGVs), collaborative robotics, digital twins “the shop floor with digital mockup”, private mobile radio (PMR), and asset tracking (“Supply Chain 4.0”, including via international roaming).

Airbus is running the whole gamut of Industry 4.0 cases, then, mostly on 4G for now. “Connectivity is everywhere in the aviation domain,” noted Castagnino.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9992774128913879}",neutral,0.9992774128913879,0

"Press Release: Airbus extends SLS capability to A320, delivers to easyJet - - Runway Girl Network","Mon, 06 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjIvMDYvYWlyYnVzLXNscy1hMzIwLWVhc3lqZXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has delivered the first Airbus A320neo equipped with the latest Satellite Based Landing System (SLS) technology to long standing customer easyJet. SLS enables pilots to perform ‘straight-in’ approaches using satellite precision when coming into land at airports, without the need for additional ground-based systems such as *ILS, even in low-visibility conditions, while saving fuel and reducing emissions.

SLS first entered service in Europe with the A350 in 2015 after Airbus had successfully pioneered its development and introduction for *CAT1 approaches with support of the EU Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA) – formerly known as the GSA – and the European Commission. An SLS function is also available on A220 and A330 aircraft families and in progress for the A380.

“By using SLS, airlines benefit from improved operational capabilities and operational efficiency,” says Philippe Mhun, Airbus Head of Programmes and Services. “We are very pleased to offer this new Air Traffic Management capability now on the A320 Family, which demonstrates how Airbus is keeping its aircraft at the cutting-edge of technology.”

He adds: “The introduction of satellite based technologies highlights the benefit of Airbus’ cross-divisional collaboration. With Airbus Defence and Space being one of the world leaders in satellite technology, we take advantage of this expertise and apply it to commercial aviation. We are grateful for the excellent support provided by the EUSPA and the European Commission.”

Airbus is also developing the new generation of EGNOS, the European Satellite Based Augmentation System. “Airbus is engaged and committed to the delivery of the next version of the programme by 2027,” stated François Gaullier, Head of Telecom and Navigation at Airbus Defence and Space. “SLS users will seamlessly benefit from the increase in performance as the service becomes available at additional European destinations.”

David Morgan, Director of Flight Operations, easyJet, said: “We are excited about this latest technological development as it represents another step towards further improvement of the efficiency of our operations while helping us to reduce fuel usage and therefore tackle our carbon emissions. “We believe that modernising the aviation sector is a crucial goal requiring the joint and coordinated effort of the entire industry. We are committed to support the development of new technologies, together with our partners across the industry, allowing us to operate in the most efficient and technologically-advanced way possible for the safety of our customers and the protection of our planet.”

The A320neo Family incorporates new generation engines and Sharklets, which together deliver at least 20 percent fuel and CO2 savings, as well as a 50 percent noise footprint reduction. At the end of April 2022 the A320neo Family had received more than 8,000 orders from around 130 customers. Since its entry into service six years ago, Airbus has delivered over 2,200 A320neo Family aircraft contributing to 15 million tonnes of CO2 saving versus the previous generation aircraft which they replace.

Launch of Hydrogen South West consortium to accelerate the transition to a net zero future - Airbus,"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wNi1sYXVuY2gtb2YtaHlkcm9nZW4tc291dGgtd2VzdC1jb25zb3J0aXVtLXRvLWFjY2VsZXJhdGUtdGhl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Nine leading organisations join forces to drive the development of a hydrogen infrastructure ecosystem

Consortium will enable cross-sector partnerships to produce, utilise, capture, store and transport hydrogen across the South West and beyond

Major step in UK’s ambitious target to deliver 10 GW of hydrogen production by 2030

A group of nine leading organisations covering aerospace, shipping, hi-tech engineering and public utilities have come together to launch Hydrogen South West, a partnership which will create an infrastructure ecosystem that will bring the benefits of hydrogen to the South West of England.

This infrastructure ecosystem of key industries will decarbonise transport, commerce and power, drive sustainable growth, upskill the region and deliver new job opportunities.

Focusing on key challenges around decarbonising key industries such as shipping, aviation and housing as well as industrythe consortium comprises leading companies easyJet, Airbus and Hynamics (EDF); industrial heavyweights GKN Aerospace; consultants and engineers Costain and Wood; and regional leaders Bristol Port, Bristol Airport, and Wales and West Utilities.

The collaboration creates links between supply and demand centres in the region, and enables cross-sector partnerships that will drive the development of hydrogen infrastructure and technology.

Hydrogen South West supports the government’s ambitious drive to generate 10 GW of low carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030. It will also provide a means for further representation and collaboration in national initiatives.

Several pilot projects are planned, including:

Hydrogen Hub at Bristol Port – a study is underway to explore configuring the port to accept hydrogen by ship, power landside vehicles with hydrogen and establish a hydrogen production facility at the port. The project includes developing a local pipeline network and supporting Airbus’ hydrogen-powered aircraft of the future

Project Acorn – easyJet aims to begin flying hydrogen aircraft as soon as they are commercially viable. To prepare the ground, the company will introduce hydrogen powered Ground Support Equipment at Bristol Airport

UK ZEDC - Airbus is launching its Zero Emission Development Centre (ZEDC) for hydrogen technologies. This will assist developing Airbus’s ZEROe passenger aircraft by 2035, supporting the drive to ‘jet zero; green jobs and ambitious net zero targets

“The South West has a rich engineering and energy history, and is home to a powerful cluster of leading aerospace, transport and logistics businesses,” said Simon Earles, Hydrogen South West chair. “This combination of industrial experience, delivery expertise and regional knowledge presents a formidable opportunity to accelerate the UK’s transition to alternative power at scale.”

Jey Williams, Head of Fuel Systems Integration and Airbus focal point for Hydrogen South West, added:

""This is a perfect follow up to Airbus’ recent announcement of investment in the Airbus Filton site as a Zero Emissions Development Centre. We’re delighted to be a member of this consortium. HSW will leverage Airbus’ positive impact on the region in terms of hydrogen skills and supply chain development, and in turn Airbus will benefit from cross-industry collaboration to understand and deliver the hydrogen ecosystems needed for net zero flight.""

Max Brown, VP Technology at GKN Aerospace said:

“The next decade is critical to build the foundations of a sustainable future, which will require significant collaboration across industries and Government. Hydrogen is set to play a key role in that future, as we collaborate to achieve the Government’s Net Zero 2050 targets.

There are clearly major challenges to develop the infrastructure needed and Hydrogen South West has been established to help meet this challenge head-on. GKN Aerospace is already exploring the technology to enable hydrogen-powered zero carbon emissions flight, and with its strong industrial ecosystem, we see the South West as the ideal hub for hydrogen development in the coming years.”

Andy Clarke, Director of Integrated Transport at Costain:

“The South West has a rich history of developing innovative transport connections and is perfectly positioned to link greener energy, heat and power with key transportation modes including shipping lanes and flight paths. These connections make it the obvious choice for creating an ecosystem for the roll out of hydrogen to the UK.

“At Costain, we see moving away from carbon-based fuels for transportation as critical to our efforts to enable healthier, happier and better-connected communities. By leveraging new technologies and even more collaborative ways of working, we can enable seamless, cleaner and more active journeys for customers.”

The partnership is working with Business West to create a skills development proposition that would bring upskilling and employment benefits to communities across the West of England. This has been formalised with the Hydrogen South West Skills Consortium. By driving investment and innovation in decarbonising technology, the South West is poised to become a centre of excellence for hydrogen expertise.

Ever since the introduction of the Jumbo Jets in the 1970s, long-haul air routes have been dominated by wide-body, twin-aisle jets that can carry hundreds of people between large hub airports. Today, a combination of advancing technology, a changing global market, and adjustments to a post-pandemic world has produced a growing demand for airliners that have the range of larger jets, but with a smaller capacity.

Scheduled to enter service in early 2024, the A321XLR is based on the A321neo and is the latest in the A320 family of narrow-body single-aisle aircraft. While sharing many features with its predecessor, the A321XLR has a newly designed rear-center tank and fuel system, plus a new center wing box to support the extra weight.

The result is an airliner that can carry 180 to 220 passengers on flights lasting up to 11 hours for a range of 4,700 nm ( 5,400 miles, 8,700 km). According to Airbus, it enjoys 30 percent better fuel efficiency per seat over previous-generation aircraft with reduced NOx emissions and noise.

About 500 orders have already been secured for the A321XLR and Airbus' biggest competitor, Boeing, has not indicated that it plans to build a rival single-aisle XLR of its own.

""This is a major milestone for the A320 Family and its customers worldwide,"" said Philippe Mhun, Airbus EVP Programmes and Services. ""With the A321XLR coming into service, airlines will be able to offer long-haul comfort on a single aisle aircraft, thanks to its unique Airspace cabin. The A321XLR will open new routes with unbeatable economics and environmental performance.""

Airbus Foundation's priorities and highlights - Airbus,"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTA2LWFpcmJ1cy1mb3VuZGF0aW9ucy1wcmlvcml0aWVzLWFuZC1oaWdobGlnaHRz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus Foundation has evolved its strategy to address some of the key challenges facing society today, with its mandate including climate change since 2021. As it publishes its latest Annual Report, Managing Director Rachel Schroeder outlines the Airbus Foundation’s achievements, current priorities and is looking ahead to 2023.

What is the Airbus Foundation and what is its mission?

Although you see Airbus in the name of the Foundation, we have a different mission and mandate from the Airbus businesses. What we do is fully aligned with the sustainability mission and objectives of Airbus, however. The Foundation is a French Corporate Foundation and a separate legal entity, funded by Airbus Commercial SAS, Airbus Helicopters SAS and Airbus Defence and Space SAS.

The Foundation is governed by a Board of Directors with internal and external members. Julie Kitcher is the Chairperson while Bruno Even and Mike Schoellhorn also sit on the Board together with other top management and employee representatives. We also have four external experts who are Board Members representing our three pillars: Environment, Humanitarian Response and Youth Development.

The Foundation leverages Airbus products – aircraft, helicopters, satellite imagery and more – providing their use to our partners for free. We don’t give financial donations, but instead, we work together with the partners in a strategic way to help them deliver aid, address climate change and nature conservation challenges and to support the development of young people. The work we do is not aimed to support Airbus’ business objectives. Instead, we are a philanthropic organisation. Our humanitarian partners are global NGOs and non-profit organisations like the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), the World Food Programme Global Logistics Cluster (WFP-GLC) or Action Against Hunger (ACF).

How would you sum up the Foundation’s 2021 achievements and current priorities?

In 2021 we refocused the Foundation’s activities around the three areas mentioned earlier. The inclusion of the Environment pillar reflects Airbus’ sustainability priorities and the absolute importance of addressing climate change. Last year we finalised two new environment-related partnership agreements – with Connected Conservation Foundation and the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Both these partnerships involve the use of Airbus’ satellite imagery to address climate change and to monitor and protect fragile ecosystems. One of our priorities in 2022 is to reach out to our humanitarian partners and explore the potential of our support for their environment-related objectives.

The Foundation also responded to various humanitarian aid requests, including the ongoing pandemic. Notable missions included providing helicopter support to Chile and Papua New Guinea to help them address COVID challenges and to Haiti after a devastating earthquake. We delivered COVID aid to Nepal using an A350 and throughout 2021 our partners requested satellite imagery to help them perform valuable pre- and post-event assessments.

Youth Development programmes were equally important. In the wake of the COVID pandemic, the work our partners were able to do was often severely compromised as children couldn’t attend school and group activities were limited or non-existent. But we spent the year working on evolving our strategy to provide more online content and to develop the Airbus Foundation Discovery Space, including creating explanatory videos about hydrogen and DIY experiment videos. We also started work on a self-development booklet for older children and some of the previous in-person mentoring activities were able to start again. Our partnership continued with the European Space Agency and Autodesk, supporting the international ""Moon Camp Challenge"". The objective is to build a moon settlement in 3D, supported by a teacher and focussing on learning-by-design and science experimentation. We saw a significant increase in the number of students taking part.

Looking ahead to 2023 when the Foundation’s mandate is up for renewal, we are now defining our road-map for the next five years based on the three pillars. I sincerely believe that the Airbus Foundation is a strong force for good and that we can help make a difference in people’s lives. The fact that we are able to use Airbus products gives us a broad and powerful portfolio that no other Corporate Foundation I know of has at its disposal. When you combine this with the technical expertise of Airbus employee volunteers who support us as technical or topic experts, we can consider ourselves uniquely equipped to address some of the world's most pressing challenges.

Airlines looking for an in-flight satellite connection have a new way to choose. Airbus unveiled its HBCplus offering. a flexible satellite connectivity solution, at Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg this week.

The program brings connectivity options into the Supplier Furnished Equipment catalog for line-fit, as well as for retrofit on all Airbus aircraft lines. HBCplus, which initially encompasses Ka-band services, will enable airlines to connect to a choice of Managed Service Providers (MSPs) via a new certified terminal and radome built as part of the aircraft. In the future it is planned to extend HBCplus to include MSPs which offer Ku-band services.

We are excited to offer airlines a new connectivity service solution that will provide improved speed and reliability for passenger experience and more flexibility. Together with our leading industry partners we are pleased to enable future connectivity business opportunities in the context of the Airspace Link open ecosystem. – André Schneider, Airbus VP Cabin & Cargo Program

The program launches with Inmarsat as the launch network provider, and Safran Passenger Innovations (SPI) as the first antenna terminal hardware integrator.

For its part, Inmarsat is proud to have its GX Aviation solution chosen as the first network available in the catalog. Having it as a check-box on the new aircraft order paperwork offers a number of advantages, and the company sees more of that as the first provider in the catalog. But Inmarsat expects that competition is coming, and knows it must continue improvements.

Inmarsat’s William Huot-Marchand sees the new platform as an opportunity for the GX Aviation platform to shine. “The key is to provide innovation. Typically the more you standardize, the less you see innovation. “

Huot-Marchand continues, “When you pick great standard hardware that is powerful, reliable, cheaper, lighter, lower drag, the innovation will come from the software we will deliver, the way we manage the services, and bringing more applications to the platform.”

The Safran kit includes a partnership with ThinKom and Astronics for antenna and communications components, as well as development of the installation kit.

Our partnership with ThinKom and Astronics strongly supports SPI’s connectivity vision and supports our continued growth in the IFC market. The Ka2517 antenna solution, along with a MODMAN that supports multiple modem providers, are key pieces in supporting our customers and providing them with the best systems available today, and for the future. – John Andrews, Safran’s VP, Connectivity

ThinKom will supply its ThinAir® Ka2517 phased-array aero satellite antennas for SPI’s Ka-band commercial inflight connectivity (IFC) terminals The antenna will be packaged with a newly designed adapter plate, installation kit and in-cabin connectivity package provided by Astronics.

Astronics Connectivity Systems and Certifications (CSC) will also deliver its new Dual-modem Modem Manager (Modman) and a new support structure for the gear installed outside the aircraft. The Modman integrates multiple third-party aero modem cards in a 4MCU enclosure. The launch version of the Modman will include the iDirect iQ800 modem with multiple additional configurations available to provide flexibility for customers.

The integrated installation kit also includes a simplified installation design and novel use of quick disconnect fittings to improve the serviceability of the on-aircraft equipment. The low-profile antenna and radome reduces drag, fuel burn, and emissions.

SPI’s selection of a mechanical antenna solution for this terminal offering also raises some questions around the company’s efforts to deliver an electronically steered phased array solution to the market. The company had been developing that solution since at least AIX 2019. Whether this is the end of that effort or – more likely – another step in the evolution of the terminal offerings to continually deliver improved services remains to be seen.

A version of the Ka2517 antenna kit is currently installed on more than 150 single-aisle aircraft flying for Spirit Airlines and Air Canada. Thales Group handled the integration of that solution. It was also announced as an option from Inmarsat for its GX+ network. In the latter context, having Inmarsat using it on HBCplus is an easy transition.

This is the second deal delivered in as many weeks for ThinKom and Astronics. The pair separately announced last week a new ThinAir Ka1717 solution targeting the regional jet market.

"Jumpin' Jetfuel June – Finnair, Gevo, Qantas, Airbus, Delta, Neste, Southwest, SAFFiRE and more SAF just this month ... - Biofuels Digest","Sun, 26 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaW9mdWVsc2RpZ2VzdC5jb20vYmRpZ2VzdC8yMDIyLzA2LzI2L2p1bXBpbi1qZXRmdWVsLWp1bmUtZmlubmFpci1nZXZvLXFhbnRhcy1haXJidXMtZGVsdGEtbmVzdGUtc291dGh3ZXN0LXNhZmZpcmUtYW5kLW1vcmUtc2FmLWp1c3QtdGhpcy1tb250aC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Jump for joy and jetfuel! June was jaw-dropping for SAF and the aviation industry and it’s not just because of Finnair and Gevo’s new 7 million gallons per year of sustainable aviation fuel sales agreement. It’s Qantas and Airbus. It’s ATR and Braathens. It’s Shell, Accenture and American Express. It’s Delta, Neste, Colonial Pipeline and Buckeye Partners. It’s Cepsa and Vueling. It’s Repsol and Iberia. It’s Southwest Airlines and SAFFiRE Renewables.

And that’s just in June and the month isn’t even over yet!

In today’s Digest, how what used to be a year’s worth of SAF news happened in less than a month, the jetfuel joyride that we don’t see going away anytime soon, the newest Finnair and Gevo deal, and more.

Finnair and Gevo

Let’s start with the newest announcement just days ago that Finnair signed a new fuel sales agreement with Colorado-based renewable fuels producer Gevo, Inc. The agreement outlines the details for the purchase of 7 million gallons per year of sustainable aviation fuel for five years starting from 2027. The expected value for the agreement is $192 million over the five-year period, including associated environmental benefits. This agreement is part of oneworld Alliance’s plan to purchase up to 200 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel per year from Gevo.

Finnair uses an extensive toolkit to achieve emission reductions – using sustainable aviation fuels, reducing the weight of aircraft, developing fuel-efficient flight methods, offsetting, and engaging customers in reducing aviation emissions. Finnair is also actively exploring the possibilities of introducing new technologies into its operations.

Gevo’s sustainable aviation fuel is produced using inedible corn products that are processed to create ethanol that is then converted into sustainable aviation fuel. The fuel is used with book and claim principle on Finnair’s flights from Los Angeles.

Finnair has also made a purchase agreement with Aemetis for a total of 17.5 million gallons of blended sustainable aviation fuel to be delivered during 2025-2032. Finnair has earlier partnered with Neste in Finland to increase to use of SAF and hence reduce carbon emissions of flying.

Reactions from the stakeholders

“Finnair has ambitious emissions reduction targets: by the end of 2025, we intend to halve the level of net emissions from 2019 and achieve carbon neutrality latest by the end of 2045. SAF plays an important role for reaching these targets,” says Eveliina Huurre, SVP Sustainability at Finnair.

“Gevo was founded on the principle of building sustainability into every step of our process,” said Dr. Patrick R. Gruber, Gevo’s Chief Executive Officer. “But it is not static—it’s always improving: We’re constantly incorporating new developments at every stage of our business system to reduce our carbon intensity. This is expected to make the renewable energy carried in our advanced renewable fuels even more impactful as they help to lower our customers’ carbon scores.”

Qantas and Airbus

Less than a week ago came news from the land down under that the Australian Sustainable Aviation Fuel Partnership was signed by Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce and Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury in Doha, ahead of the IATA AGM. The landmark agreement will see the Qantas Group and Airbus invest up to $200 million to accelerate the establishment of a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry in Australia.

Due to the lack of a local commercial-scale SAF industry, Australia is currently exporting millions of tons of feedstock every year, such as canola and animal tallow to be made into SAF in other countries.

The Qantas Group, which has committed to using 10 per cent SAF in its overall fuel mix by 2030, is sourcing SAF overseas. This includes 15 per cent of its fuel use out of London currently and 20 million liters each year for flights from Los Angeles and San Francisco to Australia from 2025.

Neste, ATR, Braathens Regional Airlines

Also just days ago was news from Sweden that regional aircraft manufacturer ATR, Swedish airline Braathens Regional Airlines and SAF supplier Neste supplier Neste collaborated to enable the first ever 100% SAF-powered test flight on a commercial regional aircraft. When used in neat form Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel reduces greenhouse gas emissions over its life cycle by up to 80% compared to fossil jet fuel use.

This historic test flight took place in Sweden and is part of the 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) certification process of ATR aircraft that started in September 2021 in cooperation with Braathens and Neste and should be completed by 2025. It has been the latest in a series of successful ground and flight tests on the ATR 72-600 prototype aircraft performed at the beginning of 2022, including flights with 100% SAF in one engine, and today it was the first time it was done with 100% SAF in two engines.

SAF Blockchain

We’ve heard a lot about blockchain in the last few years, but also last week was news that Shell, Accenture, and American Express Global Business Travel (Amex GBT) are jointly launching Avelia, one of the world’s first blockchain-powered digital sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) book-and-claim solutions for business travel. It is the largest SAF book-and-claim pilot at launch, offering around 1 million gallons of SAF – enough to power almost 15,000 individual business traveler flights from London-to-New York.

The pilot phase of the program aims to demonstrate the credibility of the book-and-claim model, using blockchain technology to ensure secured allocation of SAF’s environmental attributes to companies and airlines after the fuel has been delivered into the fuel network. With Avelia, airlines and business customers could simultaneously reduce emissions in their respective scopes, while ensuring transparency and accountability by avoiding issues such as double-counting.

SAF delivered using existing petroleum pipelines

Also this month was news that SAF was safely delivered to New York’s LaGuardia Airport through the Colonial and Buckeye pipeline systems – two essential pieces of American energy infrastructure and existing petroleum pipelines. The low-emission jet fuel will power a Delta Air Lines flight, marking a seminal moment in the ongoing development and distribution of SAF in the U.S.

This partnership between Delta, Neste, Colonial Pipeline and Buckeye Partners demonstrates the long-term viability of SAF and the airline industry’s journey towards net zero. Importantly, it shows that SAF can go anywhere there is an existing pipeline currently carrying fossil jet fuel. The milestone delivery and flight is supported by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the first U.S. transportation agency to embrace the Paris Climate Agreement and a champion for accelerating the use of sustainable fuels.

Cepsa and Vueling

Going across the ocean now to Spain’s news also this month, Cepsa and Vueling, an airline that is part of IAG, signed an agreement to accelerate the decarbonization of air transport by researching and producing sustainable aviation fuels as a tool to further reduce the carbon footprint of air transport.

The partnership will also work on the development of new energy alternatives such as renewable hydrogen and the electrification of Vueling’s ground fleets, which include supply vehicles, baggage loading and unloading operations and aircraft assistance.

Repsol and Iberia

Also in June, Repsol and Iberia took another step in their alliance to reduce emissions in the airline industry with the first long-haul flights using biofuel produced in Spain from biological waste. The biojet fuel used is from a batch produced in 2021 at Repsol’s Petronor refinery in Bilbao.

The first flight to use biofuel was the maiden Madrid-Washington DC route with a 288-passenger twin-engine Airbus A330-200. This A330-200 MTOW 242 TN version has a maximum take-off weight of 242 metric tons and uses 15% less fuel than the aircraft it replaces, making it more environmentally friendly.

The second flight to use this type of fuel will be flight IB6193 from Madrid to San Francisco, a route that Iberia resume this week following the pandemic. The third will be Iberia’s maiden flight from Madrid to Dallas, which took off at 3:55p.m. Madrid time on Wednesday. Both used the Airbus A330-200s.

Southwest Airlines and SAFFiRE Renewables

Another big announce this month was Southwest Airlines’ investment into SAFFiRE Renewables, a company formed by D3MAX, as part of a Department of Energy-backed project to develop and produce scalable, SAF. Funded with a DOE grant matched by Southwest’s investment, SAFFiRE is expected to utilize technology developed by the DOE’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory to convert corn stover, a widely available waste feedstock in the U.S., into renewable ethanol that then would be upgraded into SAF.

Bottom Line

All this SAF news was in the past 3 weeks. In the ole’ days, this would have been about a year’s worth of SAF announcements, but not in today’s world. We’ve come a long way from SAF being a rarity and aviation is one of those leaders that other industries can look to and learn from. And this doesn’t even include the other SAF high flying news related to helicopters, like this in Japan with Airbus, Euglena, Gevo, Neste, TotalEnergies and Sikorsky. Or this also in Japan with Nakanihon Air! The skies are indeed looking brighter every day.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9026279449462891}",neutral,0.9026279449462891,0
Eyes wide open: Airbus eyes growing US market for space-related optical systems - Breaking Defense,"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vYnJlYWtpbmdkZWZlbnNlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA2L2V5ZXMtd2lkZS1vcGVuLWFpcmJ1cy1leWVzLWdyb3dpbmctdXMtbWFya2V0LWZvci1zcGFjZS1yZWxhdGVkLW9wdGljYWwtc3lzdGVtcy_SAXlodHRwczovL2JyZWFraW5nZGVmZW5zZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNi9leWVzLXdpZGUtb3Blbi1haXJidXMtZXllcy1ncm93aW5nLXVzLW1hcmtldC1mb3Itc3BhY2UtcmVsYXRlZC1vcHRpY2FsLXN5c3RlbXMvP2FtcD0x?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON: After only two years of operations, the US arm of European aerospace powerhouse Airbus is mapping out expansion plans — with an eye in particular on moving some production of satellite laser communications terminals stateside.

“I’m seeing a real strong demand signal for laser comms, for investment in laser communication terminals. Also star trackers, also other elements, but I’m focusing on laser communication terminals because I think that’s the strongest candidate to build in the US,” Rob Geckle, CEO of Airbus U.S. Space & Defense, told Breaking Defense.

“I would predict that we’ll be doing that in the next two years,” he added.

Optical communications systems, including optical intersatellite links (OISLs), are critical to enabling so-called meshed networks of large constellations of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites being developed by governments and commercial firms, particularly for high-speed, internet-capable communications from space, although also for other missions such as remote sensing. For example, OISL’s are the linchpin of the Space Development Agency’s Transport Layer sats being developed as the data relay hub for the Pentagon’s ambitious Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) effort.

Star trackers, despite their moniker, are not only used by astronomers to track stars and measure their distance from the Earth. Using sophisticated optics, modern star trackers also are employed to help precisely locate and follow a satellite across the night sky, and are used in positioning satellites and spacecraft while on orbit.

Geckle explained that currently Airbus produces most of what it calls “space equipment” in Europe, with its Tesat-Spacecom (Tesat) subsidiary, headquartered in Germany, developing laser comms terminals with “really discriminating capabilities and technologies.”

Tesat already provides optical terminals to four US prime contractors participating SDA’s Transport Layer and Tracking Layer efforts, as well as to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Blackjack program, according to the subsidiary’s website. (It didn’t name the primes.) Further, the German firm announced in February that it intends to set up US manufacturing operations to meet growing demand for space-based laser communications terminals (LCTs).

Essentially, the job of Airbus U.S. is to leverage that technology, and other types of tech currently produced in Europe, for direct sales to US national security customers, company officials explain.

“What Airbus U.S. anticipates is to set up a Tesat U.S. manufacturing center within our SSA [Special Security Arrangement] to produce the current version of LCTs in the USA,” Morgan Keese, Airbus U.S. communications director said in an email. “We also expect that when modifications, derivatives or integrations will be required for U.S. classified customers, we will have USA-specific products in this space.”

Geckle noted that while Airbus U.S. does market platforms, the more “tantalizing” opportunities lie in finding a “discriminating technology” made in Europe and moving to “Americanize it” for military uses.

“Everybody wins. The shareholder wins, the taxpayer wins, the warfighter wins,” he enthused.

Airbus U.S. Space and Defense has four lines of business, Geckle said: military helicopters, military aircraft, space systems and C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance).

The company was created in 2020 to revamp Airbus’ sprawling network of specialized US subsidiaries via the creation of a centralized entity for US military sales — organizing under the aforementioned Special Security Agreement that requires a foreign firm to establish an independent US arm complete with a board of “independent directors” who hold, or are eligible for, security clearances. For example, the Airbus US board now boasts Frank Miller, a senior national security policy-maker in the Bush-era, and retired Air Force Gen. Willie Shelton, who retired as the head of Air Force Space Command in 2014.

A a specific goal at that time was to wedge open the highly classified US national security space and intelligence market. To that end, Airbus U.S. and the satellite communications firm OneWeb operate a joint venture in Merritt Island, Florida manufacturing small satellites.

Further, Airbus U.S. in January was one of five commercial firms to snag a study contract from the National Reconnaissance Office to provide synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. Satellite-based SAR sensors can “see” at night and through clouds, and images from SAR commercial providers have been particularly in demand during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

“I’m seeing some real momentum in, I’d say, the space in ISR segments,” he said. “Taking, for example, small sats. We’ve been able to be very successful — we could build up to two a day at our Merritt Island, Florida, joint venture.”

Noting that while he was unable to “get into specifics” on contracts, he added, “I see some real momentum on the US government side to sell what I would say is an improved bus, a larger bus about 350 kilograms.”

Geckle took over the reins of Airbus’ Virginia-based daughter firm in October 2021, and is vigorously looking to grow its business.

“I think that we’ve sort of punch below our weight in the US in the defense market,” he said. To be a “relevant” player in the US national security market, he added, “I personally consider you need to be a $2 billion revenue company. … We’re not there yet,” he said.

But while acknowledging it may “take years to get there,” Geckle is committed to pushing the company in that direction. “That’s my end goal,” he said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.986078679561615}",neutral,0.986078679561615,0

The manufacturer is auctioning off items including lamps, the bar, stairs, handrails, trolleys, seats, paddles, and “even the cockpit rescue rope” from MSN13, which entered service in 2008.

The A380 was used by Emirates with registration A6-EDB but was retired in 2020 and scrapped in 2021.

Airbus announced plans to sell off the parts earlier this year, stating the auction would take place in June 2022. However, on June 3, 2022, it announced that the auction would take place on October 13, 14 and 15, 2022.

The auction will be held in Toulouse and online by auctioneer Marc Labarbe, with proceeds going to the Airbus Foundation and the AIRitage association. The aircraft was deconstructed by TARMAC Aerosave, which was set up by Airbus, Safran and Suez, and aims for a recovery rate of more than 90% of an aircraft.

It’s not the only Emirates A380 being broken up that enthusiasts can get their hands on. The carrier announced in November 2021 that it was teaming up with Falcon Aircraft Recycling to transform parts and materials from aircraft A6-EDA into furniture and other memorabilia.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999985933303833}",neutral,0.999985933303833,0

Safran was chosen as the terminal provider and antenna integrator. It will use ThinKom’s VICTS phased-array technology, targeted for Ka-band. The solution is being made available on every Airbus aircraft, with entry into service expected in 2024.

In the future, Airbus plans to extend HBCplus to Ku-band.

Inmarsat is the first managed service provider Airbus has picked. It will offer its GX Aviation inflight broadband solution. Additional MSPs will join the HBCplus offering later, Airbus says.

“We are part of the next evolution in the inflight connectivity industry by providing the technology for airlines to select the connectivity services most suited to their needs,” says Matt Smith, Safran Passenger Innovations’ CEO. HBCplus is supplier-furnished equipment, available as a line-fit and retrofit option on all Airbus programs.

The airframer is counting on its Airspace Link ecosystem to open the door to applications developed by third parties. Typically, life vests may be equipped with radiofrequency identification tags that would enable the crew to quickly check all are on board.

Air India Close to Acquiring Widebody Airbus 350s - Airways Magazine,"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vYWlyLWluZGlhLXdpZGVib2R5LWEzNTBzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air India Close to Acquiring Widebody Airbus 350s

DALLAS – Air India (AI), India’s national carrier, is in advanced talks with Airbus to purchase A350 jets. The carrier was acquired by Tata Group in January this year, promising passengers a better experience and service under the tagline “Wings of Change.”

Since then, AI has embarked on a journey of changes, the first of which was a complete revamp of the booking and frequent flyer portal.

The airline has started working on “entry into service” for state-of-the-art Airbus A350-900 aircraft, which are expected to join the fleet early next year. AI is currently seeking consent from pilots who wish to transition to the wide-body to start training in the A350s as the transition from A320 to A350 involves cockpit commonalities as confirmed by Airbus.

A Possible Early Delivery

It is understood that early delivery of A350s is possible as the aircraft built for Russian carrier Aeroflot (SU) wouldn’t be delivered owing to the current sanctions.

Qatar Airways (QR), which is currently at a crossroads with Airbus on the degrading paint on its 350s, also has orders in place for more 350s which are nearly built and could be made ready in the coming months. Airbus is considering alternate customers for these birds and Air India is right on spot to grab the opportunity.

A team of top executives from Tata Sons is currently in Hamburg to finalize the interior and seating layout details.

Air India currently operates a fleet of close to 150 aircraft, of which 30 have been grounded due to the non-availability of components and spares. The airline is in desperate need to modernise its fleet and also add new routes to the map. It currently operates Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners and Boeing 777s between North America, Europe, and Australia.

Tata Sons and Air India chairman N Chandrasekaran earlier said that the need of the hour is to augment the fleet with modern aircraft and it would be addressed with the utmost urgency.

The A350 is expected to cater to routes in North America and Australia owing to its long-range capabilities.

It was recently considered the plane of a bygone, pre-pandemic, era, according to Bloomberg. However, overwhelming flight demand has brought it back from the near-dead.

It’s great news for plane spotters who enjoy a thicc fuselage as well as airlines who no longer have to worry whether or not its A380s are worth keeping around.

When the pandemic first took hold in early 2020, many airlines didn’t see much of a use for the enormous jets. Qantas parked 12 of them in the California desert, saying they wouldn’t be needed for at least three years. Etihad Airways also parked 10 A380s, unsure if they would ever fly again.

But now, all of that is in the past.

[T]this year’s sudden travel recovery has given the cavernous jets — often seating more than 500 people — a new lease of life. They have become the long-range jumbo of choice for airlines from the UK to the Gulf and Australia as passenger volumes stretch aviation workforces that were depleted during the crisis. By the end of 2022, monthly A380 flights will be almost 60% of pre-Covid totals, Cirium data show, defying the jet’s doubters. British Airways will operate more A380 flights by the end of the year than it did before Covid-19.

Other airlines like Singapore Airlines, Qantas Airways, Korean Air Lines, Japan’s ANA Holdings and South Korea’s Asiana Airlines are beginning to phase the A380 back into fleets, according to Reuters.

Lufthansa is also said to soon be deciding if the A380 should come back for the airline. All and all, analysts say the fleet will never truly return to pre-pandemic levels, but there will be more of then in the air than expected.

Yet 106 are back in service, according to data firm Cirium, up from a low of just four when the crisis hit in April 2020. There is little second-hand demand for A380s, so airlines often face a choice of flying or scrapping them.

The A380 was at one point billed by Airbus as a 21st-century cruiseliner, and they were supposed to bring 1,000 planes into service. That being said, only 242 were ever built, so it missed the target by a smidge.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999544620513916}",neutral,0.9999544620513916,0
History Special: A300 - The First Airbus - Sam Chui,"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vc2FtY2h1aS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNi8zMC9oaXN0b3J5LXNwZWNpYWwtYTMwMC10aGUtZmlyc3QtYWlyYnVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After World War 2, the USA dominated the production of civil airliners, with the unassailable dual advantage of a huge domestic market and an industrial infrastructure untouched by the war, while much of the rest of the world’s manufacturing capacity lay in ruins, especially on the other side of the Atlantic.

Nonetheless, the 1950s saw a leap forward in aviation technology, including in Europe where the first jetliners flew – in order, the de Havilland Comet (Britain, 1949), the Sud Aviation Caravelle (France, 1955) and the Tupolev Tu-104 (USSR, 1955). It was the Boeing 707, which first flew in December 1957 and entered service with Pan Am in October 1958, that decisively won the first round of the jet age for the USA. Although some early European jetliner projects were reasonable sales successes, especially short haul twin-jets such as the BAC-111 (244 built) and Caravelle (282), the experience of Hawker Siddeley with the Trident (117, mostly to state-owned BEA) and Vickers with the VC-10 (54, mostly to BOAC) in the UK, and Dassault Aviation with their 737-alike Mercure (11 including the prototype, all to Air Inter) in France was more representative.

These aircraft were engineering triumphs, with the Trident pioneering the three-engine configuration that powered Boeing’s 727 to an early jet age sales record of 1,832, and the four-engine long haul VC-10 was more popular with passengers and pilots than the 707; but a lack of commercial focus led to financial disaster, usually due to catering exclusively to the needs of small home markets at the cost of sales abroad.

By the mid 1960s in Europe, every manufacturer was working on a widebody peoplemover: Hawker Siddeley’s Hs.132 and Hs. 134; the British Aircraft Corporation’s BAC-311; Breguet’s Br124 (a double decker powered by four Rolls-Royce Speys); Nord Aviation’s N600 (also two decks and four Speys); Sud Aviation’s Galion; and yet another double decker at Avions Marcel Dassault.

A high-level meeting between government ministers of France, West Germany and Britain in July 1967 resulted in an agreement for greater European cooperation in the field of aviation technology making full use of the benefits of the European Economic Community, also known as the Common Market, and specifically, to build a widebody twin airliner, and be commercially successful. This was the first time the word “airbus” was used, at that point still a generic aviation term for a larger commercial aircraft. The word took hold because it was linguistically appropriate to all parties, including the French.

The new project was headed by general manager Henri Ziegler and technical director Roger Beteille, both of Sud Aviation; German politician Franz Josef Strauss was appointed chairman of the supervisory board. France would build the cockpit, wing box and control systems; Germany would build the upper fuselage; and Britain would build the wing.

The lessons of Europe’s poor sales record were being learned. Beteille had to turn his back on his native tongue and culture by insisting that the working language of the new collaboration would be English, and metric would not be used, as even in metric-compatible countries such as in continental Europe, US aircraft dominated, running on feet, pounds and knots.

The new airframer was officially incorporated on July 25, 1967, in an agreement between the governments of France, West Germany and the United Kingdom. With concerns about the viability of the project however, the UK withdrew from the project on April 10, 1969, although France and West Germany wanted the Hawker Siddeley wing, so Hawker Siddeley borrowed £35m to continue as a subcontractor while France and West Germany’s ownership share of the consortium went from a third to half each (later to 47.9% each as Spain’s CASA took a 4.2% share).

The aircraft was called the A300 for the target was 300 passengers, although the final design was a slight shrink on the original paper plane, and 270 was more likely except in the highest density layout.

A deliberate emphasis was placed from the very start on incorporating the very latest technology. A widebody twin was revolutionary in itself. In addition, the new bird was the first airliner to use carbon fibre instead of metal, initially in the leading edge of the vertical stabiliser and the nose cone. The rear-loaded wing was a very advanced design, as was the high tech avionics which included autothrottles for every stage of flight including landing, and windshear protection. That said, the A300 was being created only twelve years after the first transatlantic passenger jet flights, so some traditional elements couldn’t be avoided, including a full scale design mock up made of wood.

Air France fired the starting pistol on September 3, 1970 by ordering six A300s, followed by Lufthansa for three aircraft and four options. The first flight took place out of the new consortium’s headquarters at Toulouse on October 28, 1972 with Max Fischl in command and Bernard Ziegler in the right seat.

The spectre of commercial failure that haunted the civil aerospace industry in Europe pushed Airbus to make aggressive moves to find customers for their new machine. In an ambitious move, the prototype left Toulouse on September 15, 1973 and flew to the Sao Paolo airshow in Brazil, followed by stops in Rio, Brasilia, Caracas, Port Of Spain, Kingston, Mexico City, Miami, Chiago, Cinncinati, Saint Louis, Boston, New York JFK, Washington Dulles, Boston and Montreal. It was almost fortuitous that an engine failed after takeoff at Mexico City, one of the world’s most notorious “hot and high” airports, where performance is degraded by atmospheric conditions. The occurance provided a vivid demonstration that a widebody twin could climb safely away on a single engine even at the most demanding airports, and that Airbus could respond quickly to get a stranded bird back in the air fast – which they did. Other than that incident, the A300 performed perfectly; the return to Toulouse on October 18 was via Gander, London and Paris.

Another sales tour took the prototype to Bombay and Delhi, departing France on October 31 with stops en route at Amsterdam, Athens, Belgrade, Damascus and Tehran. A sales trip to southern Africa was used to perform further “hot and high” trials at Windhoek (Namibia) and Kinshasa (today’s Democratic Republic of Congo, then known as Zaïre).

On March 15, 1974, the A300 was certified in Europe after 1,585 hours of test flying (1,205 hours for development and certification, and 380 hours for route proving, training and sales and demonstration flying). The FAA followed on May 30.

The first revenue flights of an A300 and indeed any Airbus took place when Air France flew two round trips from Paris to London Heathrow on May 23, 1974; with the delivery of their second and third machines, Nice, Dusseldorf and Milan followed. The second operator was Trans European Airways in Belgium, who received the A300B1 prototype, the only B1 to enter service. Korean Air Lines (today Koreanair) were the first non-European customer. Air Siam flew two aircraft on from their base at Bangkok to the likes of Singapore, Jakarta and Hong Kong.

1975 saw some orders continue to come in at a snail’s pace. Henri Ziegler himself went to India to secure an order from Indian Airlines; he had been born in India and was able to produce a photograph of himself as a boy with Gandhi. Three orders and three options were signed and the planes were well suited to heavily-patronised domestic trips within India. Interestingly, unlike in the western hemisphere, most of Asia had no rules about how far twin-engined transports could fly from land, so early A300s made overwater hops across the Arabian Sea to the Persian Gulf and out over the Bay Of Bengal long before ETOPS-regulated twins began plying the North Atlantic a decade later.

December 1975 marked the beginning of an eighteen month drought were Airbus did not sell a single aeroplane. A focus on Asia finally resulted in a sale to Thai Airways for two aircraft but when an anticipated order from US major Western Airlines did not materialise, the Airbus sales team resorted to desperate measures.

Bernard Lathiere, who took over from Henri Ziegler in 1976, persuaded ex-astronaut Frank Borman, CEO of US domestic monolith Eastern Airlines (at the time the world’s largest airline outside the Soviet Union), to take four unsold A300s currently sitting in Toulouse for a four month trial period at no cost to the airline. The aircraft were adorned with Eastern’s rakish two-tone blue hockey stick cheatline and delivered in late 1977, entering service on December 13, mostly up and down the eastern seaboard between the densely-populated northeast (New York, Boston, Philadelphia) and Florida (Miami, Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, Tampa).

At the end of the trial period, the verdict was in – the A300 was a perfect fit for Eastern, burning less than two-thirds as much fuel as a Lockheed L1011 Tristar, and the comfortable 2-4-2 seating was popular with passengers. On April 6, 1978, Borman bought the four already in operation, plus nineteen more to make an initial order of twenty-three, with an additional eleven later added to make a fleet of thirty-four.

With the Airbus project now showing signs of becoming a real success, Britain wanted to be let back in to the consortium as a full member. France and West Germany insisted that a British airline buy A300s as part of the reunion, and so low-cost pioneer Laker Airways stepped up to buy ten aircraft; the deal for Britain to take a 20% share (reducing West Germany and France to 37.9% each, with Spain still retaining its 4.2% share) was struck on November 28 and implented on January 1, 1979. The Laker purchase was finalised on April 10, 1979.

With the economics of the widebody twin now firmly established, Airbus found widespread acceptance and the orders began rolling in. A300s became a familiar sight at airports around the world, most notably in Asia where large fleets were operated by Philippines, Thai International, Malaysia Airlines, Japan Air System (previously known as Toa Domestic, or TDA), Garuda Indonesia, Trans Australia Airways, Pakistan International and China Air Lines of Taiwan.

Pan Am became the second customer in the USA with an order for thirteen – in hindsight the airline was already well established on a death spiral that ended with bankruptcy in 1991, but at the time was still a blue-chip customer and represented a significant milestone in acceptance for Airbus in the airline world. “It's an important win for Airbus,” Robert Kugel, an analyst with Morgan Stanley told the New York Times when the order was signed on September 13, 1984. “It says conclusively that they will be a serious competitor in the future along with Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.”

The possibilty of refinements was realised with the A300B4-600, later designated the A300-600. The slightly different tail and empennage of the A310 was used (adding only a couple of inches to the overall length but a significant amount of extra useable interior space), a refined wing including the simplication of the trailing edge Fowler flaps and a recambering of the rest of the trailing edge, the addition of a small wingtip fence, the deletion of the outboard aileron, a new APU, and uprated engines from both Pratt & Whitney (PW4000) and General Electric (CF6-80).

The A300-600 first flew on July 8, 1983 and received its type certificate from the French and German authorities on March 9, 1984. The first deliveries were Pratt & Whitney-powered to Saudia and Kuwait Airways, both in June. The first General Electric-powered plane went to Thai International in September 1985.

A long-range variant with an extra fuel tank in the horizontal stabiliser, adding an extra 6,150 litres (1,620 gallons) to the total fuel capacity, was dubbed the A300-600R for Range and kicked off with a huge order by American Airlines who bought thirty-five, mostly to serve high-density markets in the Caribbean and Central America. Although the -600R had greater range than the B4, it was still not truly intercontinental. American did use their A300s on shorter transatlantic trips such as New York to London (Lufthansa also flew Frankfurt to Boston) albeit with payload penalties. The American Airlines flights to London were mostly to preserve use-it-or-lose-it slots at Heathrow until more Boeing 777s could come online, restricted on the westbound leg to 101 passengers in summer.

Monarch Airlines in the UK became an enthusiastic operator of the A300-600R, flying their four machines from early 1990 until April 2014, mostly to European sunspots in summer, ski resorts in winter, with some long haul trips such as Goa (usually via Bahrein to pick up fuel), Mombassa (via Athens) and Florida (via Gander).

The A300-600F was developed at the initiation of parcel mover FedEx with an order for thirty-five, and ninety for UPS (United Parcel Service), later reduced to fifty-three. Daimler-Benz Aerospace, later known as DaimlerChrysler, created a conversion programme for older passenger aircraft which included the retrofitting of the -600F’s large main deck cargo door, the replacement of passenger door 2L and 2R with a blank shell panel, reinforcement of the main deck floor, and enhanced smoke detection and suppression systems. The first converted A300B4 was delivered to Channel Express in July 1997.

Although the components of the first A300 were entirely delivered from their subcontractors around Europe to the final assembly line in Toulouse entirely by surface transport – road, rail and sea – the advantages of moving key sections by air was quickly apparent and it was as early as 1974 that Airbus acquired its first Aero Spacelines Super Guppy and built up to an eventful fleet of four. These unique machines, based on the Boeing C-97J Turbo Stratocruiser but with a vastly expanded upper fuselage, were built to transport oversized parts of the rockets in the US manned spaceflight programme, and were appropriated by Airbus from the mid-1970s to fly completed sub-assemblies such as fuselage barrels from Germany, and wing sets from Wales. This was satisfactory for a couple of decades but by the end of the 1980s the huge Airbus empire needed more carrying capacity.

Airbus considered a number of options, such as an Airbus A340 with the payload attached to the outside of the fuselage, or adapting a Boeing 747 or Ilyushin Il-86. Boeing even submitted a proposal based on the 767. In the end it was decided that the best solution was an in-house adaption of the A300-600R, to be known as the A300-600ST Super Transporter, or Beluga for short.

The project was established as a joint venture between Aerospatiale and Deutsche Airbus (now DaimlerChrysler). The finished aircraft has an 80% airframe commonality with a regular A300-600R, including the wings, General Electric engines, landing gear, lower fuselage and pressurised flight deck, and 90% systems commonality. The added weight and size of the Beluga required the use of the larger A340 rear fuselage and empennage, with vertical fins added to the ends of the horizontal stabilisers to counter the side force of up to 30 knot crosswinds on the huge fuselage.

The Beluga can carry the forward fuselage of an A330, measuring 5.6m (18’4”) by 25m (82ft) or a complete set of wings which weight 42t. The Beluga is significantly faster than the Super Guppy, and can be loaded and unloaded twice as fast, reducing the time it takes to transport a complete Airbus airliner from 45 hours to 19 hours, which means one Beluga represents the equivalent of 2.3 Super Guppies.

The first Beluga was assembled in sixteen months and the first example took to the air on September 13, 1994 for a maiden flight of four hours and twenty-one minutes. After 400 hours of test flying, the A300-600ST was certified on September 25, 1995 and introduced to service in January 1996. The next three Belugas were delivered at a rate of one a year: March 1996, May 1997, June 1998, followed by a fifth machine in January 2001. The Belugas are now being augmented by new Beluga XL aircraft based on the A330.

The last A300 to be manufactured was an A300-600F and was the 554th A300 built. It performed its first test flight out of Toulouse on April 18, 2007 and was handed over to FedEx on July 12.

By the second decade of the twenty-first century, the A330-200 which matched the A300’s capacity but with true intercontinental range, and the stretched -300 which was more of a transcon people mover (although more recently range increases have been achieved) meant the A300 was no longer at the forefront of efficiency. One by one, passenger airlines began retiring their fleets, either to be scrapped or converted to freighters. The last operators were China Eastern on domestic trunk routes out of Shanghai, Thai Airways on domestic runs out of Bangkok to the beaches, and Kuwait Airways.

That only leaves just Iran, where, due to sanctions banning the sale of new aircraft, old A300s including classic B2s and B4s soldier on with Iran Air, Mahan Air and Meraj Air (previously Saha Air). The A300 flies on with freight operators including FedEx and UPS whose youngest A300s are only just coming up to their tenth birthdays, as well as European Air Transport who have a fleet of twenty-one aircraft currently in the livery of TNT, a number of Turkish operators (MNG Airlines, MyCargo, Onur Air), Sudan Airways, Egyptair and Air Hong Kong. Airbus have announced a support package for the type which is guaranteed up to 2025, which means the A300 will easily fly for half a century or even more. The 1960s dreams of a commercially successful European airliner project, and pan-European industrial cooperation had been realised.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999089241027832}",neutral,0.9999089241027832,0

by DRONELIFE Staff Writer Ian M Crosby

During the ILA Berlin Air Show, Airbus signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Munich Airport International to begin marketing turnkey solutions to cities and regions interested in establishing advanced air mobility (AAM) ecosystems worldwide.

Continue reading below, or listen:

Airbus is currently underway with the development of its CityAirbus NextGen, an electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, alongside its related support and services offerings. Meanwhile, Munich Airport is providing ground infrastructure services and solutions.

“Munich Airport International is already collaborating with Airbus on the Air Mobility Initiative recently launched in Munich – now we are expanding that partnership globally to support select cities and regions around the world,” said Ivonne Kuger, Munich Airport International’s Executive VP of Corporate Development. “As Europe’s first 5-star airport Munich Airport has always been at the forefront of innovation and it is crucial for airports to be actively involved in developing and paving the way for this new form of transport. ”

“The development of the market, industry, and the ultimate service of AAM requires a holistic view and this has been our approach from the beginning. In addition to our decades of vehicle and technology development, certification, and support, we are actively building working ecosystems with our partners,” said Balkiz Sarihan, Head of UAM Partnerships and Strategy Execution at Airbus. “We are sure that our partnership with Munich Airport will be a key catalyst for accelerating the development of the AAM ecosystems worldwide.”

The goal of the two companies is to establish entirely new ecosystems that will guarantee the effective integration of eVTOL solutions with other forms of mobility. A partnership between global and local stakeholders is essential to the successful integration of the disparate AAM components.

Revealing its fully electric eVTOL prototype, CityAirbus NextGen, last September, Airbus has been developing an AAM solution with eVTOLs in order to offer a new mobility service as well to work towards the reduction of emissions across its product range. An innovator in the research of electric propulsion for the advancement of aerial vehicles, the company recently announced the launch of the Air Mobility Initiative, a network committed to the development of AAM in Bavaria and Germany.

A popular search-and-rescue helicopter, the Airbus H225 was powered by two Makila 2 engines using SAF, serving as one of the first major milestones towards achieving the company’s goal to reduce CO2 emissions from its helicopters by 50 percent by 2030.

“This flight with SAF powering the twin engines of the H225 is an important milestone for the helicopter industry. It marks a new stage in our journey to certify the use of 100 percent SAF in our helicopters, a fact that would mean a reduction of up to 90 percent in CO2 emissions alone,” said Stefan Thomé, executive vice president for Airbus Helicopters.

The importance in SAF lies in its ability to drastically reduce CO2 emissions across the entire aviation industry. Even though testing is in full swing, SAF can already be used today as a mixture with conventional jet fuel—without engine modifications.

According to Airbus, all of its commercial aircraft are certified to fly with a 50 percent blend of SAF. The company became the first manufacturer to offer aircraft capable of using a SAF blend in 2016, delivering more than 90 such aircraft since then.

Currently, SAF only makes up 0.1 percent of all aviation fuel production. Airbus predicts that figure will increase dramatically once SAF usage mandates become widespread.

What is SAF?

SAF comes in many varieties, including biomass-based and eFuel.

Biomass-based SAF is created using renewable raw materials, such as used oil, grease, and municipal waste. EFuel is based on sources such as captured carbon or leftover gasses from industrial processes.

Outside of the obvious environmental benefits, widespread use of SAF could reduce dependencies on crude oil, allowing aviation fuel to be produced within local supply chains—which would in turn bolster local economies.

Last year, Airbus Helicopters launched the SAF User Group, an entity dedicated to advancing the use of blended SAF kerosene and certifying 100 percent SAF for all Airbus commercial aircraft by the end of the decade.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9339911341667175}",positive,0.9339911341667175,1

A400M: Airbus supports German Air Force transformation to sustainable aviation fuel - Airbus,"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wNi1hNDAwbS1haXJidXMtc3VwcG9ydHMtZ2VybWFuLWFpci1mb3JjZS10cmFuc2Zvcm1hdGlvbi10b9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Berlin, 21 June 2022 – Airbus is supporting the German Air Force in their long-term transformation to increase sustainability of its aircraft fleet. Airbus is working with the German Air Force towards providing the Luftwaffe with a technical allowance to commence national A400M flight trials with loads of up to 50 percent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in the near-term. SAF is a proven alternative fuel that can reduce life cycle CO2 emissions by up to 85 percent compared to conventional fuel.

By that, Germany, which has a total of 53 units on order, is becoming the first customer nation to launch a gradual transformation to SAF for their operational A400M fleet.

“The Luftwaffe’s objective is to launch a transformation towards sustainability of their fleet. Their mission is ours. We are gladly supporting these important efforts, not only for the A400M but their entire fleet of Airbus aircraft, ranging from VIP transport to fighter jets,” said Mike Schoellhorn, Chief Executive Officer of Airbus Defence and Space.

“Moving towards a more sustainable future is the fundamental duty of everybody. Switching from petroleum-based kerosene to sustainable fuels plays a big part in aviation’s efforts to cut CO2 emissions. Our government aircraft are already cleared for SAF. Working closely with the industry we are eager to finally certify the A400M as well. Looking into the future we are supporting all activities to introduce SAF for our entire fleet including fast jet aircraft”, said Lt.Gen. Ingo Gerhartz, Chief of the German Air Force.

Besides supporting national customer activities, Airbus has embarked on a long-term roadmap towards achieving 100 percent SAF readiness and certification for the A400M.

As a first step, in 2022, Airbus plans a test flight of an A400M aircraft with a fuel load of up to 50 percent SAF. This initial test flight will be conducted with one engine to better assess the aircraft’s overall behaviour. Upon successful completion of this one-engine flight, Airbus is expecting to continue with four engine trials in 2023.

Once testing activities are completed on the basis of four engines, the A400M platform will formally be allowed for customers with access to 50 percent SAF.

Furthermore, Airbus, OCCAR and the A400M Nations are engaged in initial discussions to develop the roadmap towards the certification and operational use of 100 percent SAF.

This is clearly something that will not happen overnight. This type of fuel first needs to be assessed technically by the engine manufacturer before we can commence with flight tests to certify the TP 400M engines for 100 percent SAF. Today, this type of fuel is not yet fully standardised nor tested. We are in the preliminary stages for an initial feasibility check”, said Schoellhorn. “This engine-level plan would be integrated with the required flight test activities at Airbus level for final A400M certification.”

Earlier in 2022, Airbus Defence and Space performed the first flight of its C295 Flight Test Bed, a Research & Development project of the European Clean Sky 2, which aims at the use of new technologies and materials to achieve noise, CO2 and NOx reductions. With the C295, Airbus also aims to conduct a test campaign for flights with 50 percent SAF in 2022 and 100 percent SAF in 2023.

Key milestones achieved in Manned-Unmanned Teaming for future air power - Airbus,"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTA2LWtleS1taWxlc3RvbmVzLWFjaGlldmVkLWluLW1hbm5lZC11bm1hbm5lZC10ZWFtaW5nLWZvci1mdXR1cmUtYWlyLXBvd2Vy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The ability to task unmanned systems from a manned aircraft is an important force multiplier in Airbus’ vision for future air power, with a wide range of applications extending to combat scenarios and beyond.

As a pioneer in the realm of Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T), Airbus has developed an ambitious technological roadmap to make this innovative concept – which boosts the effectiveness of piloted and pilotless aircraft alike – a reality. The company demonstrated leading technological and industrial capabilities in 2021 and 2022, including key flight tests.

Fully implementing Manned-Unmanned Teaming – which will play an instrumental role in such initiatives as the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) and Multi-Domain Combat Cloud – requires a high level of automation. However, the involvement of human operators will ensure that meaningful control always will be retained.

Leveraging Airbus’ expertise

The involvement of Airbus with Manned-Unmanned Teaming began in 2018, when the first flight test campaign took place to validate initial capabilities. Since then, the development has seen increasing levels of maturity – with Airbus and its partner teams focusing on several key areas.

Synchronized and efficient use of manned and unmanned vehicles necessitates coordination and optimisation, with requirements that may vary from one mission to the next. To address this, Airbus is developing artificial intelligence-based teaming concepts and algorithms, including swarming behaviours and distributed teaming intelligence shared among the platforms.

This novel approach is reflected in the payloads, which can be integrated on the unmanned aircraft, as well as in the way they are used. For example, a distributed electronic warfare sensor was shown to be capable of precisely and quickly locating a threat and sharing its location across the network.

To achieve such capabilities, the unmanned assets must be able to communicate with the manned resources – and among each other in an agile and robust way, which is why an advanced data link is one pillar of the development.

Additionally, Airbus is preparing airframe solutions for future unmanned systems, building on experience in both unmanned aerial vehicles and combat aircraft. As the development progresses, these solutions will materialise as the FCAS Remote Carriers – unmanned aircraft designed to cooperate with fighters. To achieve the full potential, MUM-T technologies will also need to be relevant for already-existing unmanned aerial systems and for those developed in the future.

Continuing development

Building upon lessons learned from the previous MUM-T-related milestones, Airbus marked a major achievement with a live demonstration that linked company-built Do-DT25 target drones acting as surrogate Remote Carriers with an in-flight German Air Force Eurofighter aircraft. This occurred during the Timber Express 2021 multinational exercise organised by the German Armed Forces.

During the trial, the Eurofighter was able to assign tasks to two Airbus Do-DT25 Remote Carriers in real time. These unmanned platforms demonstrated the ability to perform several tasks, including aerial reconnaissance and electronic warfare. Upon receiving the tasks, the Remote Carriers autonomously planned their flight routes, adhering to prescribedairspace restrictions and circumnavigating known threats.

In 2022, MUM-T-related flight tests were performed outside of Germany for the first time. A test campaign organized in the Finnish areas of Rovaniemi and Kemijärvi – and directed by the Finnish Defence Forces (FDF) – marked the official start of cooperation with the German Armed Forces on this key capability.

As stated by the FDF in a press release: “The research cooperation strengthens the Defence Forces’ understanding of the development of unmanned aviation, which enables experimenting and evaluating the teaming of unmanned and manned aerial vehicles in the local operational environment.”

In parallel, the capabilities of manned platforms are increasing to accommodate the future potential of Manned-Unmanned Teaming. Airbus’ multi-role A400M airlifter is envisioned as a launcher of FCAS Remote Carriers, with the first flight test already performed to confirm this capability.

"Airbus, Qatar Airways in Discussion on A350 Dispute – Airways - Airways Magazine","Mon, 20 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXFhdGFyLWRpc2N1c3MtYTM1MC1kaXNwdXRlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus, Qatar Airways in Discussion on A350 Dispute

DALLAS – Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury says the manufacturer is in talks with Qatar Airways (QR) on the A350 paint and safety issues.

The manufacturer and the airline have been fighting in a public and bitter legal dispute over defective paintwork that the airline says endangers its planes by exposing the copper lightning protection mesh. Qatari officials had grounded all QR A350s till the issue was addressed by Airbus.

Last month, the British High Court ruled against the airline, which had asked the court to split the case into two parts: 1) to order Airbus to conduct a deep analysis into the issues causing the paint to peel, and 2) to prevent Airbus from delivering more A350s to the airline.

If planes were delivered, it would trigger payment clauses. If QR rejected those delivered planes, Airbus would be free to offer them to other airlines.

On the margins of the 78th IATA Annual General Meeting being held in Doha, the Airbus CEO told Reuters that progress was being made in the sense that both parties were speaking to each other.

Echoing Mr. Akbar Al Baker, who said last month he hoped the dispute could be resolved outside the court of law, Faury agreed that a settlement would be preferable, admitting that Airbus was in a tough spot but that it was committed to finding a solution.

Are the Qatar A350s Airworthy?

Qatar is seeking around US$1bn in compensation from Airbus, with the value of the claim rising by US4$m per day. So far, Airbus has acknowledged the problem but says that it has fully reviewed and solved the quality issues and that safety is not compromised. The European Aviation Safety Agency has said the planes are airworthy.

Qatar Airways Chief Executive, Mr. Akbar Al Baker, has remained critical of the erosion of the paint surface, which he mentioned had also affected other carriers.

However other airlines have continued to fly the A350 without any issues. Some have seen a similar problem in paint deterioration, but none have grounded the type due to the issue.

Qatar has 21 A350s on order, some of which are ready to be delivered. The airline already has 34 A350-900s and 19 A350-1000s in its fleet, although some are grounded. It will be interesting to see how the whole episode turns out and in whose favor, as both are facing some seriously unprecedented times.

easyJet Firms Up Airbus Order – Airways - Airways Magazine,"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vZWFzeWpldC1maXJtcy1haXJidXMtb3JkZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"easyJet Firms Up Airbus Order

DALLAS – As easyJet (U2) attempts to stabilize its operation this summer, the carrier has announced that it will expand its firm order book by 56 Airbus aircraft.

The deal announced on Tuesday 21, June will see 56 A320neos delivered between 2026 and 2029. It also revealed that it would convert 18 of its A320neo orders to the larger A321neo.

easyJet will use deliveries to replace its older A319 and A320 aircraft. The A320neos have 186 seats, while the A321neo can accommodate 235 passengers.

Part of 2013 Order

List prices value the order at around £5.4bn (US$6.5bn). However, U2 said it would pay significantly less than that as part of an agreement reached in 2013.

“Given constraints on Airbus delivery slots, should the Proposed Purchase not proceed, easyJet would not have a secure supply of aircraft between FY 2026 and FY 2029 and would therefore need to either decrease its fleet size or source alternative new generation aircraft with higher ownership costs,” a spokesperson for the airline said.

U2 Chief Executive Johan Lundgren said the order would give the airline ‘better cost efficiencies and sustainability enhancements.’

“If instead we sourced aircraft from the secondary market, this may expose us to older technology. EasyJet would face greater exposure to fluctuating fuel prices and carbon-related taxes and would be competitively disadvantaged relative to the more modern fleets operated by its competitors.”

The new jets will be used to replace A319s and older A320s such as G-EZTC that was delivered in April 2009. Photo: Alberto Cucini/Airways

Growth Plans

Indeed, the order forms part of the carrier’s plan to show its muscle in the European aviation industry after a recent takeover bid by rival Wizz Air (W6).

Last September, easyJet raised £1.2bn (US$1.5bn) in new capital. It also commenced a new growth plan that would see it expanding its route map, increasing its number of focus cities, and building its operation in its core markets.

Recently the airline was able to secure additional slots in Lisbon (LIS). It will add three Airbus aircraft to the base, allowing U2 to become the second-largest carrier in the Portuguese capital.

Thankfully, no one was hurt. Of course, it may not be fair to call this a “hit and run” accident because crewing a widebody is hardly comparable to wheeling a 15-foot automobile in rush hour.

The nighttime incident happened as the A330-200 taxied past the rear of the stopped and just-landed 777-200ER, and apparently went unnoticed by the ITA crew. No word on whether any passengers noticed and tried to alert the cabin crew. The crew of the 777 took notice, however, at least after conferring with ground crew, and notified Kennedy Ground control of the incident with specific advice to withhold takeoff clearance for the Airbus. Shockingly, despite a half-hour passing with both airplanes still on the ground, word didn’t travel quickly enough, and ITA flight AZ611 departed.

Reportedly during its climbout on the way to Rome, the ITA crew was queried by New York Tower or Departure about whether they were aware of any contact with another ship on the ground, and they replied that there had been none.

While unspecified damage to the 777 was apparently enough to keep it out of service for more than a week and counting, the ITA Airbus appears to have resumed a normal schedule after three days of downtime in Rome. Naturally, the NTSB and FAA are investigating the incident, and we wouldn’t be surprised if EASA takes a particular interest, too.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.795026957988739}",negative,0.795026957988739,-1

The NH90 Operational Support (NOS) contract, which will be performance based, will see both nations delegating a major part of their logistics and maintenance activity to NHIndustries, enabling them to focus on their operations. The agreement was also designed in a way that allows additional nations to join at any time.



""NHIndustries is fully committed to ensuring customer satisfaction, and the contents of this agreement have been carefully crafted in order to provide the French and German armed forces with the right set of services for improving NH90 operability, affordability and serviceability. This new support contract will also strengthen our current relationship with our partner NAHEMA,” says Nathalie Tarnaud-Laude, President of NHIndustries. “The contract includes support of the customers’ continuing airworthiness management organisations, which ensures the continued airworthiness of aircraft and their parts, and establishes an improved approach for supply chain management for spare parts and

component MRO.”



“This agreement, made up of a harmonized set of services that cover the operational needs of several helicopter variants, marks a new phase of the dynamic engagement between NHIndustries and NAHEMA”, says Admiral Giorgio Gomma, General Manager of NAHEMA. “We are confident that this new approach will improve the effectiveness of NH90 fleets and could soon be expanded to other nations that operate these helicopters.”



Through the contract, NHIndustries takes full responsibility for ensuring the continuous flow of spare parts to France and Germany through a flight-hour-based service. It will manage the inventories of both nations, while also allocating resources to ensure that scheduled inspections and maintenance run seamlessly.



Additionally, the contract includes a variety of catalogue services that can be activated as required by the entire community or by individual nations, thus allowing maximum flexibility. The agreement covers five years of support with two optional extensions of five years each, for a total duration of 15 years. It will serve up to 100 NH90s in France and up to 131 NH90s in Germany.



The NH90 military helicopter is a modern, multi-role rotorcraft designed to meet the most stringent NATO standards. Developed in two versions – tactical transport (TTH) and NATO frigate helicopter (NFH) – the NH90 contains a unique, fully integrated mission system for operations in the most demanding conditions over land and sea, day and night. It has been ordered by fourteen nations (France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Australia, Finland, Greece, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, Qatar, Spain and Sweden).
