Airbus A330 - Global Security,"Mon, 07 Nov 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHNlY3VyaXR5Lm9yZy9taWxpdGFyeS93b3JsZC9ldXJvcGUvYTMzMC5odG3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus A330

In 1986, Airbus took a further leap with another new program, the A-330/340. This took shape as a single airplane that could accommodate either two or four engines. The A-330 was the twinjet version; it was larger than the A-300 and the Boeing 767. The A-340 was the four-engine version. Built for long range, it served transoceanic routes that covered world-spanning distances but attracted too few travelers.

The popular Airbus twin-engine long-range family has flown over eleven million operational hours and attracted over 70 customers and operators. Its global market endorsement is reflected in record sales. Since the original version of the A330-300 entered service in 1993, the principal attraction of the type has been its very low operating cost per seat. Thanks to the introduction of numerous product improvements, it remains the most cost-effective aircraft in its class.

The popularity of the A330 is due to its ability to match market range and efficiency requirements better than any other aircraft in service, by offering the cost benefits generated by high levels of technology in its structure, aerodynamics and systems. The wing is aerodynamically optimised to be fuel-efficient for medium to long-range routes. A member of the Airbus fly-by-wire Family, the A330 allows Cross Crew Qualification and Mixed Fleet Flying. The A330 Family also profits from improvements developed for the A340-500 and -600, including the introduction of lighter and stronger metal alloys and advanced composites to reduce airframe weight.

Thanks to the A330's true widebody fuselage, the cabin is optimised for both flexibility and comfort, enabling airlines to offer all passengers the highest levels of comfort of any aircraft in its class. The A330 main deck volume is echoed in the lower deck, which allows airlines to carry more revenue-generating cargo consolidated on pallets and containers loaded side-by-side, something which is not possible with existing competition in this category. This feature has, for example, enabled some operators to profitably fly regional overnight freight-only services with the A330 after a full day's passenger service.

The A330 cabin is designed for both flexibility and comfort. With generous, true widebody dimensions, the A330 is able to accommodate seat and class configurations to suit a wide spectrum of operators' requirements. The A330 cabin is quieter than other large twinjet aircraft. Overhead stowage is designed to match the most popular ""roller-bag"" sizes. The A330 can be equipped with the latest in-flight entertainment systems as well as the new generation of on-board communication features, allowing passengers and crew to be as well connected in the air as on the ground. The spaciousness of the A330 cabin is matched by the capacity of its underfloor cargo holds. These allow airlines to carry large amounts of revenue-generating cargo in both pallets and containers.

A330 passenger models may be powered by General Electric, Pratt and Whitney or Rolls-Royce engines, each optimised to minimise the environmental impact in terms of noise and emissions.

The A330-300 typically accommodates 295 Passengers in three classes. It has a range of up to 10,500km/5,650nm and has excellent operational flexibility from regional services, such as Hong Kong-Taipei to longer-range routes like Bombay to Sydney. The A330-300 is the world's lowest operating cost per seat aircraft in its segment, typically accommodating 335 passengers in two classes for regional operations or 295 travellers in three classes on long-haul routes of up to 10,500km/5,650nm. Today, the A330-300 is the reference for airlines serving intra-Asia routes.

Comfortably carrying 253 passengers in a typical three-class arrangement, the A330-200 entered into service in 1998. Developed from the larger A330-300, its range of up to 12,500km/6,750nm enables it to easily serve destinations like Tokyo from the US West Coast, or from Sao Paulo to London non-stop. The smaller capacity A330-200 has a range of 12,500km/6,750nm with 253 passengers in a comfort three-class seating arrangement. The A330-200 can easily serve non-stop destinations from Latin America to North America and Europe, from Asia to major US West Coast as well as operating economically on medium ranges.

The A330 Family continues to evolve. Its latest member, the new A330-200F is the only modern solution for the mid-size freighter market. It is projected to enter service at the end of 2009. The newest Airbus freighter will offer operators between 64 tonnes and 69 tonnes payload, representing 30 per cent more volume than any freighter in its class. Another benefit the A330-200F brings to operators is a new dual weight capability, enabling them to grow their business by opening up or extending the cargo routes they currently operate. Typical range with a 64 tonne payload is 7,400km/4,000nm. This new aircraft meets the current and future noise and emissions regulations and will be an ideal solution for operators looking to replace their older mid-sized freighters currently in-service and modernise their fleet.

The A330 reached the milestone of over 600 firm orders in November 2006. This showed a strong market endorsement of Airbus' environmentally friendly, long-range twin-engine in production aircraft which is leader in the medium to extended range category. The milestone was reached with the firm order, previously announced, for six A330-200s by TAM, Airbus' largest customer in Latin America.

"Middle East fleet outlook: widebody popularity increases, Airbus to grow market share | CAPA - CAPA - Centre for Aviation","Thu, 24 Nov 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL2NlbnRyZWZvcmF2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS9hbmFseXNpcy9yZXBvcnRzL21pZGRsZS1lYXN0LWZsZWV0LW91dGxvb2std2lkZWJvZHktcG9wdWxhcml0eS1pbmNyZWFzZXMtYWlyYnVzLXRvLWdyb3ctbWFya2V0LXNoYXJlLTYzNDA20gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus and Boeing both took major orders from Middle East carriers, but Bombardier and Antonov also announced orders.

Middle East fleet: 25-Nov-2011

Order highlights

On the first day of the airshow, Dubai's Emirates placed a record order for 50 B777-30ER, a deal worth around USD18 billion at list price. About half of these will be used to replace the carrier's mix of older and smaller B777s and A330s and its long-range A340s. The remaining half can be deployed to open a handful of ultra-long-haul routes and thicken capacity on existing routes or more medium/long-haul routes. The B777s will complement the carrier's higher capacity A380, as it moves to coalesce its passenger fleet around three types - the A380, A350 and B777 - by the end of the decade.

See related article: What another 50 Emirates B777-300ERs means: some growth, replacement and competition for others

Despite Emirates' order, the B777's popularity in the region will, for now, decrease as the A320 increases significantly and the A350 is delivered. The prospect of a new B777 variant could propel the type back into being the single most common type of aircraft in the region, reflecting the need for carriers to merge large numbers of capacity across large distances. Perhaps surprisingly the A320 is the next most common type of aircraft in the region, reflecting the smaller and more regional operations of the Middle East's non-network carriers as well as Etihad and Qatar finding use for the narrowbody workhorse, particularly on routes with little premium traffic.

Not to be outdone, Airbus sealed its much talked about deal with Qatar Airways for 50 A320neos and 5 A380s, albeit not without some smoothing of ruffled feathers for the carrier's outspoken CEO, Akbar Al Baker. The deal was worth about USD6.4 billion at list prices. The airline also took the option to buy 30 more A320neos and five additional A380s.

The A320neo order highlights Qatar Airways different strategy from the all-widebody Emirates. Qatar Airways is adding not only long-haul routes, but a slew of medium-haul routes this year. The carrier plans to add 15 destinations in 2012, including Perth, Helsinki, Zagreb, Baku and Tbilisi, but also destinations closer to Qatar, including Gassim, Zanzibar, Kigali and Mombasa. The aggressive expansion in 2012 follows an equally aggressive 2011, with the airline adding 14 destinations and a 15th - the Chinese city of Chongqing - to follow before the end of the year.

Qatar Airways also ordered two B777Fs from Boeing as it plans to grow its freighter fleet. The airline also announced - threatened, perhaps - that it is looking at up to 15 B767Fs, as Airbus may be unable, or unwilling, to develop a passenger to freighter conversion for the airline's existing fleet of A330s.

The widebody orders are propping up the type's share of aircraft orders in the region. Widebody aircraft currently account for 53.9% of aircraft in service and 71.1% on order. For both aircraft in service and on order in the region, widebody frames account for 62%.

Oman Air has picked up an order for six B787s, taking the aircraft off the hands of Kuwait's Aviation Lease and Finance Corp (ALAFCO). Oman Air was to have leased the aircraft, but ALAFCO has been divesting itself of its B787 orders, of which it had 22 at one point. Earlier this year, the leasing company signed a deal to transfer eight B787s to Saudi Arabian Airlines and lease another four to the carrier.

For Oman Air, the B787s form the backbone of its long-haul fleet development programme. The aircraft will be used to update and modernise the airline's fleet, supplementing and then replacing the airline's A330s on routes into Asia and Europe. Oman Air also has another six B737-800s and two E-175s on order.

In addition to the B787 sale to Oman Air, ALAFCO finalised an MoU signed at the Paris Air Show earlier this year for 30 A320neos and expanded the deal by another 20 aircraft, to a total of 50. The leasing company also took options for 30 more to be finalised by year-end, taking the total value of the deal as high as USD4.6 billion. ALAFCO is already in negotiations with potential A320neo customers, even though the aircraft will not commence delivery until late 2015.

Bombardier also made an appearance at the airshow with a commitment for its new CSeries from Turkish LCC Atlasjet. The carrier signed an LoI for 10 of the larger CS300 variant and includes options for five more CSeries aircraft. The LoI is expected to be firmed up within the next two months.

Bombardier is targeting CSeries sales in the Middle East, opening up a new Bombardier Commercial Aircraft regional sales and marketing office in Dubai to serve the Middle East and African markets. Qatar Airways has been vacillating about an order for the aircraft for three years, although both sides have not given up on the order. Bombardier considers airlines operating in Turkey and the Middle East to be prime candidates for CSeries aircraft.

Just under half of all aircraft in service with carriers in the Middle East are from Airbus. With Airbus accounting for 66% of aircraft on order, its share of aircraft in service and on order is 55%. Boeing's equivalent share is 35%. As carriers have not shown interest in the Bombardier CSeries or the new narrowbody aircraft from emerging manufacturers - the C919 from COMAC, MS-21 from Irkut or Sukhoi Superjet - Airbus and Boeing will continue their dominance.

As the order books of airlines in the Middle East continue to swell, it seems that even the most ambitious of forecasts for the region are insufficient. Airbus' latest forecast is that the Middle East will need 1921 commercial aircraft with the regional fleet to almost treble, reaching 2260 by 2030. Boeing's forecast is even more aggressive, with an outlook for 2520 aircraft and a regional fleet of around 2710 aircraft. Boeing estimates that two thirds of all orders will be for expansion rather than replacement.

With almost 1000 aircraft already on the order books of Middle East carriers, more orders are certain to come as smaller carriers and LCCs sort out their fleet plans over the next few years.

Between them, the 'big three' - Emirates, Etihad and Qatar - have more than 500 aircraft on order. More than 80% of the aircraft are widebodies, with deliveries stretching all the way back to 2022.

Airbus rolls out test A320 with sharklets installed - Flightglobal,"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXJvbGxzLW91dC10ZXN0LWEzMjAtd2l0aC1zaGFya2xldHMtaW5zdGFsbGVkLzEwMzE0NC5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has rolled out its A320 test aircraft following the fitting of 'sharklet' wing-tips, which will be an option on new-build aircraft and standard on the re-engined A320neo.

The test aircraft, MSN1, will undergo flight-testing ""in the coming weeks"", said the airframer.

Sharklets, which replace the A320's wing fences, will reduce fuel-burn on the type by up to 3.5% on longer sectors of around 3,000nm (5,560km), Airbus claims.

The airframer also expects the sharklets - each of which is 2.5m (8.2ft) tall - to improve take-off performance by up to 3t.

This would provide the A320 with a higher available take-off weight from runways subject to obstacle limitations.

MSN1 will be used to assess the performance of the modification, while Airbus will begin building wings next year which are capable of supporting the new tip.

Installation of the sharklet requires inboard and outboard reinforcement to handle different loading, as well as changes to outer wing ribs to accommodate the structure.

Several carriers have already signed to take the sharklets, including Air New Zealand, Air Arabia, Finnair and LAN.

"The ABC�s Of Aviation: Airbus, Boeing, China - Forbes India","Thu, 03 Nov 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlc2luZGlhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RodW5kZXJiaXJkL3RoZS1hYmNzLW9mLWF2aWF0aW9uLWFpcmJ1cy1ib2VpbmctY2hpbmEvMjkzNzIvMdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"How comfortable would you feel if you boarded an aircraft that was entirely developed, manufactured, and assembled in China by a wholly-owned Chinese company? That reality may occur in the near future. With global industry revenue projected to increase to $4 trillion by 2029[i], of which approximately 12% [ii] is expected to occur in the Chinese market, new competitors are quickly strengthening their positions in the historically duopolistic airline industry. Amongst these players is Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), a Chinese state-owned aircraft manufacturing company, which is focused on fiercely competing with industry leaders Boeing and Airbus. COMAC’s aspirations are to obtain market share and at the behest of the Chinese government reduce the country’s reliance on foreign airline manufacturers.



COMAC’s advancement in this market is fueled by acquiring different processes and technologies through numerous partnerships involving technology transfers. These partnerships include a $ 2 billion agreement with GE for avionic systems intended to be utilized in the first 2,300 C-919 aircraft cockpits. Additionally, COMAC’s parent company reached an agreement with Boeing in June 2011 to open an innovation center in Xi’an, China[iii]. This contract includes hands on training for Chinese employees and is intended to play a key factor in assisting COMAC to successfully learn and integrate many of Boeing’s effective business practices into its own operations.Other technology sharing partnerships include Airbus, Honeywell, United Technology and Embraer. While technology transfers via partnerships are important factors in COMAC’s growth strategy, China’s lack of intellectual property protection has led many western based firms to share older technologies and processes whereby safeguarding their latest technological advancements. Accordingly, integration of these non-cutting edge technologies could prove detrimental to the quality and efficiency of COMAC’s initial production plans and may hinder its ability to compete globally.The Chinese government plays a strong role in facilitating growth as well as the competitive advantage of its airline manufacturing industry. This was evidenced in China’s tenth 5-year plan which placed aviation among the top three strategic industries for development. The Chinese airline industry is financed through heavy government subsidies as well as generous state funding which consists of extremely low interest rate bonds. Government intervention in this industry could lead to lack of transparency and rampant corruption that are both credited as causes for past safety failures.In further evaluations of this new airline production initiative, three words come to mind, “Made in China…” What has become synonymous with this phrase? High quality? Reliability? Safety?If the events of July, 23 2011 are any indicator of this phrase’s significance, the above descriptors are a far cry from reality. On that day, a devastating crash on the state’s newly completed high-speed train sparked a public relations nightmare for China’s developing technological sector. Originally this accident was attributed to a lightning strike. However, it was later confirmed by the Shanghai Railway Commission that the crash, which resulted in 39 deaths and over 200 other injuries, was caused by a safety system failure. According to An Lusheng, head of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, the system “failed to turn the green light into red.” While the Chinese government has vowed to punish those responsible for this negligence and to place a greater focus on safety in its train sector, it has yet to be seen whether China is truly dedicated to achieving global quality and safety standards.Two days before the crash, the state-run People’s Daily newspaper rebutted criticism of the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed rail and boasted about the train’s superior technology. A Chinese Railway Ministry spokesperson further expanded on this rebuttal by claiming his country’s high-speed rail technology was far better than that of Japan’s bullet trains. In contrast, Japan’s bullet train network has run for 47 years with a near-perfect safety record.Six days after the high speed train accident, another incident occurred involving a radiation leak on a Chinese nuclear submarine. The leak’s root causes were believed to be substandard construction and rushed training. The government reacted to this information by imposing bans on news coverage of the situation as well as censoring other forms of media outlets, including over 1,000 Chinese websites.[iv] The media censorship of these disasters served to further bolster frustration and discontentment among the Chinese public.In a November 2010 case that raises questions about safety, construction quality, and the effectiveness of the nuclear regulatory body in China, Kang Rixin, the former head of the China National Nuclear Corporation, was sentenced to life in prison for abuse of power and acceptance of bribes.There are many additional instances that portray the same underlying concerns associated with the Chinese in the global economy. For example, there is a lack of transparency and accountability within state-owned enterprises in China that gives rise to shortcuts which jeopardize safety and quality for high growth development.Although these disasters have caused turmoil amongst the Chinese public, the country is not only continuing its production in these industries but has increased its focus on additional sectors of the transportation industry, namely the airline industry.In late November COMAC unveiled the C-919, its future staple airliner, which is intended to compete with the Boeing 737 and Airbus 320 for the sweet spot of the airline market. With a cost expected to be 20% lower than its powerful competitors[v], COMAC has already received commitments for 100 units[vi] from Air China, China Southern, China Eastern and Hainan Airlines, as well as the U.S.-owned GE Capital Aviation Service. Governmental controls have garnered guarantees from the two largest Chinese airline companies to solely purchase airliners from COMAC in the future. The Chinese government has significant influence and maintains the ultimate approval over domestic airliner purchases whereby creating a future barrier to sales for foreign competitors in the China market.These commitments and government support are strong indicators of the potential strength of the C-919 introduction. However, these government supported pre-production commitments may create a moral hazard in which COMAC may follow the traditional Chinese approach of cutting corners in either its materials or electrical components. This could very likely be used as the manner of bringing the C-919 to market at a reduced cost but would ultimately run a very high risk of product failure which could tarnish the C-919’s reputation and ability to expand globally. This view is shared by Lu Jian, an expert on airline design and head of the department of mechanical engineering at Hong Kong University who stated “there will be pressure from the government to use Chinese planes but if there are safety or reliability issues the airlines can and will refuse.[vii]”COMAC’s 2016 delivery plan for the C-919 initially focuses on the Chinese market where government protectionist policies support COMAC’s growth. The Chinese government may use its large domestic market to rapidly expand COMAC’s production and could subsidize foreign sales to position the company to be a dominant global player in the commercial airline sector.Strategic forecasts predict the C-919 to expand on a global scale. While this expansion is estimated to occur after successful integration into the Chinese market, the C-919’s competitively priced mid-sized design has already raised interest with Ryan Air, an Irish based discount airline. Although COMAC has not received firm international purchasing commitments, yet, it expects sales to surpass 2,000 units in the next 20 years.[viii]As quality production has consistently been an underlying issue in Chinese manufacturing, it is likely to be a thorn in the side of COMAC’s future expansion plans. However, with the support and backing of the Chinese government, the question is not IF but WHEN COMAC will be capable of manufacturing quality airliners and effectively competing in the global market.[i] (Boeing)[ii] (Gillet)[iii] (Mohar-Schurz)[iv] (Sheridan)[v] (Lam)[vi] (Global Security)[vii] (Gillet)[viii] (Lam)ReferencesArvai, von Ernest. “Will the Mid-Decade Narrow Body Revolution Exclude Boeing?” 1 September 2010.

Air France blames mechanics in China

An Air France jet flew for five days before ground crews noticed that 30 screws were missing from one of its wings.

The Airbus A340 plane had undergone routine maintenance in China, before flying to Paris and then on to the US before the potentially disastrous blunder was finally spotted.

The plane, which can carry up to 440 passengers, was grounded in Boston while a 'large protective panel' was screwed back into place.

The gaffe was revealed in an internal union document leaked to French news agency AFP.

Air France have blamed aircraft mechanics in the Chinese city of Xiamen, were the airline's jets are often serviced because of lower costs.

An Air France technical operations spokesman said: 'The plane flew for several days before it was grounded because one third of the screws holding down a piece of bodywork were missing.

'It was part of the outer covering of the wing and at no point was flight safety compromised.

June 1, 2009: Flight 447, an Airbus A330, from Rio de Janeiro to Paris lost contact with air traffic control while over Atlantic Ocean.

Only portions of the plane and 51 bodies, out of 228 on board, were found. The ca use of the disaster is still under investigation.

'The maintenance team that works for Air France are internationally recognised and this is the first ever incident of its kind.'

But an aircraft construction expert said: 'The piece itself may not have endangered the flight if it came off.

'But there is always the risk that it could have struck and damaged another very important part of the aircraft as it became detached and blew away in flight.'

An Air France union spokesman described the oversight as 'deplorable'.

He added: 'Pieces of an aircraft should never simply go missing during maintenance. It is not the first time this has happened either.

'Last year a Boeing 747 was grounded after undergoing maintenance in China because parts of the plane had been painted with flammable paint.'"

Vicki P. McConnell identifies possible changes in composite repair of these new designs.

Critical to the evolution of composite usage in Airbus passenger aircraft over the past 26 years, from 5% to 53% (structure weight), is the simultaneous development of effective repair methods to handle in-service damage. (Chart © Airbus.)

Scheduled for first flight next year, the A350 XWB features CFRP primary structure up to 150 plies thick. (Chart © Airbus.)

To conduct repair on the inner wall of the CFM-56-7B thrust reverser, SR Technics builds special tools and jigs for laying up repair patches and doublers. The height of this jig is 110 cm, length is 185 cm and width is 185 cm.

As part of composite repair training, Abaris instructors help students assess, repair and inspect CFRP laminate structure such as this 11 mm thick section with 7 mm-thick integral blade stiffeners.

In the next 20 years, commercial air traffic is expected to double, along with the global fleet of 100+ seat passenger aircraft, which will increase to more than 30 000 planes. This prediction is made in the latest global market forecast from Airbus, the OEM based in Toulouse, France, that builds two models of next-generation commercial passenger aircraft: the A380 (maximum passenger seating at 853) and the A350 XWB (440 passenger max). Both planes reflect the evolution of composites onboard Airbus aircraft, at 25% by weight on the A380, escalated to 53% in the A350. Also weighing in at 50% composites by weight is US-based Airbus competitor, Boeing, with its 300-passenger, next-generation 787 Dreamliner.

Clearly the past is prologue for the success of composites on these aircraft in terms of at least 40 years of proven weight savings and fuel efficiency benefits from traditional glass and aramid reinforced polymers, hybridisation of glass (GRP) and carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP), composites combined with metal alloys, and now in a greater proliferation of CFRP. Toray’s TORAYCA® prepreg is single sourced for 787 primary structures, while Hexcel prepreg is single sourced for A350 primary structures. On the A380, Toray and Toho Tenax carbon fibres are used in prepreg from both Hexcel and Cytec, along with thermoplastic composites from Toho Tenax and TenCate.

Safety, performance and cost savings have also been delivered through composite components on previous aircraft, sufficient to convince OEMs that advanced composites in next-gen aircraft will provide significant maintenance savings.

“Composites play a big part in reducing overall maintenance cost through the elimination of metallic fatigue and corrosion,” states Dr. Roland Thevenin, Senior Expert in Composite Structure Conformance for Airbus. “Airbus is counting on these benefits from CFRP components on the A350 enough so that the traditional ‘intermediate’ check at year six is eliminated. Further, the first ‘heavy’ or former D-check tasks can be extended out to the 12th year.”

Thevenin cites the step-by-step approach taken by Airbus with composites, tracking from GRP fairings on the A300 in 1972 to 5% composites by weight on the A310-300, 10% on the A320 family, 11% on the A330/A340 family and on to the higher percentages already cited for the A380 and A350.

”Each step has resulted in the necessary knowledge to progress further,” he says. “With the A350, we have reached a good level of application, though we have not yet reached the maximum of what can be achieved with composites.”

For its 787, Boeing expects a 20-30% saving in maintenance costs. The OEM just delivered the first Dreamliner in September to launch customer All Nippon Airways (ANA). The 787 also features an extension of its first scheduled D-check at the 12-year mark. Further, Boeing believes maintenance costs after the 787’s design service objective (DSO), which typically increase as aircraft age, will remain fairly stable.

Finding and fixing damage

While next-gen aircraft may encounter less overall maintenance in composite components, effective repair methods must be in place when damage occurs. Certainly four decades of practical experience in composite repair by airline operators and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) companies have established baseline methods to restore original safety and performance standards. However, the designs of new commercial aircraft will offer some unique changes that could affect the materials, tools, inspection equipment and training required to repair them.

In particular, CFRP components in primary structure on the A380, A350 XWB and 787 are made with considerably thicker, monolithic laminate, estimated at up to 150 plies thick. Other design changes involve multiple parts integration into larger, single piece components with complex contours, and bonded spars/stiffeners that were previously mechanically fastened. Further, manufacturing methods for next-generation aircraft have changed, involving automated fibre placement and tape laying.

Thevenin verifies that laminate thicknesses in composite applications range from several mm up to 40 mm (1.57 inches) on the most highly loaded areas of the A380, though thicker laminate has been used in the A330/A340 vertical tailplane’s attachment fittings, at more than 70 mm (2.76 inches). He adds that “for monolithic structure, our step-by-step approach has been beneficial for airlines, since it has enabled them to introduce composites into their fleets in a gradual progression. Furthermore, the in-service experience of primary composite parts has validated the designs as well as the certification approach and maintenance concepts.”

This includes bolted repairs of metal or prepreg patches to thick, monolithic primary structure, as well as bonded repairs. Thevenin points out that “bolted repairs are in principle similar to what is required for metallic structures and are the only ones applicable for structural repairs to restore ultimate load capability.” Bonded repairs, he states, could be used for structural repairs only if they could fulfill the fail safe requirements of patch off/load limit capability. Currently, bonded repairs are only applicable to sandwich structure (skins over core).

“Whereas monolithic structures such as the horizontal and vertical tail planes have generally demonstrated good behaviour, sandwich structures have experienced issues such as water ingress, requiring remedial action,” he says. “Consequently, when Airbus came to design the A380 and subsequently the A350, we opted for the thicker monolithic laminate approach instead of sandwich construction, including the rudder and elevators.”

On the A380, new CFRP monolithic laminates are used in the entire rear fuselage, centre wing box, and select wing ribs, while the complete A350 fuselage encompasses large CFRP panels over a composite frame.

“The thicker laminate by design prevents water ingress and offers a tremendous advantage for robustness,” Thevenin states.

He adds that in-service experience by airlines over more than 150 million flight hours across all Airbus programmes has resulted in excellent feedback regarding the performance of composite monolithic structures.

“This experience has also allowed maintenance concepts to remain largely unchanged, with traditional ‘visual inspection’ and ultrasonic inspection techniques still fully applicable to assess damage.”

Certainly SR Technics is not new to handling and repairing composites or to Airbus and Boeing aircraft. The independent MRO based in Zurich, Switzerland, has 500 airline customers and currently services A310, A320 and A330/340 models, as well as Boeing 737s in its 350 000+ m2 of MRO facilities. The company is ready for composite repair to next-gen aircraft, according to Jurg Bislin, Vice President of Engineering and Planning.

“In principle, the repair techniques for laminate thicknesses of 100 or more plies remain anchored in methods already in use today,” he states. “Specific methods such as wet lay-up or hot bond prepreg patch repair must be chosen for each individual case.”

In terms of SR Technics’ composite shops, Bislin says: “We will be looking to develop specific jigs and tooling for future composite repair requirements. With our EASA 21J approval, we will also be developing new in-house on-wing and off-wing repairs, with engineering validation of all techniques. Another challenge will be identification of hidden damage, which is likely to be higher on composites than on metallic structures. So there is a need to ensure that necessary non-destructive testing (NDT) technologies are used in the most efficient way.”

In Greensboro, North Carolina, USA, TIMCO Aviation Services is in its 21st year of operation, with both FAA Part 145 and EASA 145 certification. The privately-owned MRO employs over 1000 mechanics working within its 1.5 million ft2 of facility space on 737, 757, 767, 777, A300, A310, A320, DC10, and KC10 aircraft. The company established TIMCO LineCare services in 2010 at 21 US locations to conduct overnight line checks, transit checks, cabin refurbishment and on-call services. Jim Dinwiddie, Business Planner, reflects on the company’s composites repair experience regarding expectations for next-gen aircraft.

“We anticipate larger and more involved repairs to be sanctioned on future aircraft fleet types because more surfaces will be composed of composite construction. Damage from ground handling could likely be a significant source for such problems down the road, making these repairs a critical necessity to maintain fleet availability.”

As a frame of reference for the time involved to repair composite sandwich structure compared to thicker monolithic components, Dinwiddie describes one of the large repair types currently conducted by TIMCO, involving damage to CFRP flight controls.

“Flight controls are made up of full length upper and lower panels, and the skin thickness ranges from three plies in the bay areas to as many as 10 or more at the panel’s edge (or about 0.030 to 0.100 inch in thickness). Extensive damage requires the skin panel to be completely removed to gain access to the inner surface. The cure method is dictated by the size of the damage. Smaller areas of damage are cured using heat blankets, while larger areas of damage require special tooling and cure in an autoclave. Care must be taken during the disassembly of these panels not to cause additional damage at the numerous fastener locations and at the trailing edge where the panels are joined or sealed together. Repairs of this nature average 250 man hours to complete.”

Inspection and training

At the airlines and MROs, adequate composite-specific training of technicians who will gets hands on in conducting repairs is crucial. Inspectors must also be trained to recognise the particular reactions of composites to impact, which is much different than for metallic aircraft. Even refuellers and baggage handlers can help keep extra and informed ‘eyes on’ composites-intensive aircraft by reporting any impact incident, whether visual damage is obvious or not.

Abaris Training, Reno, Nevada, USA, works with major OEMs and trains some 1000 mechanics, technicians, engineers and managers annually in the chemistry and material science of composites and to conduct and inspect repairs.

“Integrated structures present a greater challenge than conventional fastened structures,” Lou Dorworth, Division Manager of Direct Service for Abaris, explains. “The good news is that they are inherently more robust and less susceptible to damage. However, the fact that the pressure vessels on next-gen aircraft are made through automated fibre placement changes the approach to repair. Structures like these will require a certain level of advanced, composite-specific repair design and analysis to be done in concert with NDI and prior to damage removal performed by the mechanic.”

Different repair approaches are being examined. Dorworth identifies one as “use of multi-angle or parabolic scarfing to reduce the amount of good structure removed in preparation for repair of thick monolithic structures. For CFRP inner blade stiffeners, bonded or bolted metallic or composite doublers may be used in lieu of scarf repairs.” Abaris is working closely with aircraft and repair equipment OEMs to develop new materials, processes and process control systems for next-gen composite repairs. Dorworth says most are proprietary, but certain technologies, such as micro-wire thermal sensors used to read temperatures deep inside thick laminates, show promise.

Abaris leadership has long been involved in efforts to improve training for composites technicians, and Mike Hoke, company president, suggests additional training will be a plus to repair thick section CFRP components.

“Many of us believe some sort of certification of composite repair technicians is desirable because of the degree of detailed knowledge and technical hands on skills required to perform complete composite repairs to thick monolithic structures. While individual standards have been developed by various organisations, there are no widely accepted industry standards or technician certification programmes at this time.”

OEMs also view composite training as vitally important, as Airbus’ Thevenin verifies.

“For each aircraft, Airbus proposes the relevant training for composite repairs. This training is already in line with the FAA’s Advisory Circular 65-33, which provides guidelines for a formal training programme for composite maintenance technicians that includes theory and practice. The practice includes flush or protruding bolted repairs, and skin and core restoration within bonded repairs on sandwich structures.”

Great teams adapt

As with the lack of industry standards for composite training, so goes the dearth of repair materials standardisation, a fact known only too well by airline operators. Eric Chesmar is Principal Engineer of Composite Structures at the United Airlines Maintenance Base in San Francisco, California, USA.

“Composite repair has been and will continue to be an integral part of United’s aircraft maintenance programme. Adapting to technology on new aircraft models, whether in composites, avionics or engines, is a part of our business as we retire older fleets and replace them with newer models. As with the introduction of any new fleet type, training and education are instrumental for success.”

Chesmar expects only a small increase in composite repair with early introduction of new aircraft, and notes that Boeing has addressed issues of thicker laminate with extra steps in its hotbond prepreg repair techniques and training.

United has invested in some additional tooling for the 787, but Ron Torres, Managing Director of Component Maintenance and a 30-year veteran with United Airlines, identifies the best tool available as the airline’s experienced and resourceful shop technicians and engineers.

“They work together in a spirit of continuous improvement, having developed innovative solutions such as computer-based tracking of repair material shelf life, out time, and roll quantity. This helps us control on-hand material and more accurately forecast future orders for prepregs and film adhesives.”

The team also developed special tooling and procedures in a dedicated work cell for sandwich constructed fan cowls (CFRP skins over aluminium core), which improved repair effectiveness on over 50 units/annually, right down to salvaging latches.

“United’s composite repair professionals demonstrate every day as they face many challenges that there is no substitute for a great team,” Torres says.

Speaking of tooling, the largest European airline group, Air France-KLM, houses its share in maintenance hubs in Paris and Amsterdam. Michel Bruet, Vice President of Aerostructures AFI, makes this statement:

“At Air France Industries-KLM Engineering and Maintenance (AFI-KLM E&M), we have the advantage of being both a global airline and maintenance provider with proven past and present experience in the durability and reliability of composite structure in service. This helps us make choices between adapting and modernising our present industrial tools or investing in cutting-edge new tools.”

He suggests that adaptations for repair of next-generation aircraft composite components will involve not just tooling and equipment, but also managing the economics of material cost and the network to accommodate repair material availability – possibly through common sourcing among partners. AFI-KLM E&M already has operator customers for A380 aircraft and commercial contacts for future operators of the 787.

It would seem that adaptation is an essential ingredient in bringing positive progress from past experience. Leonard Kazmerski, TIMCO’s Vice President of Marketing and Business Development, sees this trend in the design and maintenance of next-generation composites aircraft.

“There will certainly be an adjustment process for MRO companies as they are increasingly called upon to make more complex composite repairs,” he says. “Some of the larger elements for composite repairs that are undertaken today should be usable in the new environment, such as large curing ovens and autoclaves. This is not unlike adjustments the industry has made in the past to advances like the all-glass cockpit and fly-by-wire technology. The aerospace industry is an adaptive one, and will likely once again adjust to accommodate this significant change in aircraft composition and its accompanying maintenance support requirements.” ♦

Transaero Airlines to Stuff 700 Passengers Into New A380s - NYCAviation - NYCAviation,"Tue, 01 Nov 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55Y2F2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDExLzExL3RyYW5zYWVyby1haXJsaW5lcy10by1zdHVmZi03MDAtcGFzc2VuZ2Vycy1pbnRvLW5ldy1hMzgwcy8xNzk0NNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Transaero Airlines, Russia’s second largest carrier, has ordered four Airbus A380s in a deal worth about $1.5 billion based on list prices.

The Moscow-based airline says it will configure its new superjumbo cabins with about 700 seats in a three-class layout. The new planes will be operated on international routes out of its hub at Moscow’s Domodedovo International Airport. “I am sure that the operation of this high capacity aircraft will stimulate the development of Russia’s aviation sector, in particular airports infrastructure, while our passengers will benefit from a completely new experience on non-stop long-haul flights.” said Olga Pleshakova, Transaero Airlines CEO, in a statement.

Transaero will be the first A380 customer in Eastern Europe or Russia, a region where Airbus foresees the possibility of further sales. “We definitely see market potential for the A380 in Russia. Passenger traffic in this region is expected to increase at an average rate of 5.6 per cent per year over the next 20 years,” said Christopher Buckley, Airbus’ Executive Vice President Europe, Asia and the Pacific.

This will be the first widebody Airbus in the Transaero fleet, which currently consists of an impressive 11 Boeing variants: 737-300, -400, -500 and -800; 747-200, -300 and -400; 767-200 and -300; 777-200 and -300. Eight Airbus A320neos are also on order.

There was no word on delivery dates for the planes, and an engine vendor has not yet been selected."

Airbus A300 - Global Security,"Mon, 07 Nov 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHNlY3VyaXR5Lm9yZy9taWxpdGFyeS93b3JsZC9ldXJvcGUvYTMxMC5odG3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus A310

The A300-600 and A310 share the same basic airframe, and were the first jetliners with Airbus' 222-inch fuselage cross-section - the widest of any aircraft in their size category. The A300 entered revenue service first, followed by the shorter-fuselage A310. Both have a Common Type Rating for flight crews, allowing pilots qualified on one type to qualify to fly the other with a simple difference training. This commonality also applies to the engineers who maintain the aircraft - enabling pilots and engineers to use the same training simulator systems and training aids.

The same choice of engines is available for the A300-600 and A310: the General Electric CF6-80C2 and Pratt & Whitney's PW4000. Each engine is offered at power ratings best suited to the particular version's design weights. With both powerplants, the A300-600 and A310 are fully certified for up to 180 minutes extended-range twin-engine operations (ETOPS), which permits their use on routes over water and across remote regions of the globe.

The commonality of the A300/A310 Family leads to maintenance cost savings for operators because both aircraft types use many of the same spares. The A300-600 and A310 share systems, engines, flight decks, cabin interiors and major structural items resulting in lower combined spares and maintenance costs.

The A310 has lower operating weights and requires lower thrust levels than competing aircraft. As a result, the A310's direct operating costs per seat are up to 10 per cent lower. The optimised 222-inch fuselage cross-section used for both the A300 and A310 allows significant amounts of revenue-generating freight to be carried in the lower deck holds, including freight pallets and industry-standard LD3 containers.

A voluminous main deck allows up to 16 main large pallets to be accommodated on the A310 freighter. The A310's spacious lower-deck cargo holds accept the full range of existing underfloor freight containers and pallets - including the industry-standard LD3 containers loaded in an efficient side-by-side arrangement.

The worldwide success enjoyed by the A310 is the result of many factors, including the innovative 222-inch Airbus fuselage cross-section - which gives passengers a more spacious, comfortable cabin on a genuine twin-aisle widebody jetliner. Every First and Business class passenger aboard the A310 has either a window or aisle seat, while the comfortable eight-abreast Economy class cabin offers more space than any competing aircraft - with no passenger further than one seat away from an aisle.

In cockpit technology, Airbus has become a leader as the result of innovations introduced first on the A300/A310 Family. The A310 featured the first cockpit ever certificated for a two-member flight crew on a large airliner, using six cathode ray tube (CRT) displays on the instrument panel to replace traditional dial-type instruments. Electrical signaling also was used initially on the A310 for secondary flight control surfaces, preparing the way for Airbus' subsequent application of digital fly-by-wire controls on the A320, A340 and A380 Family aircraft.

With the A310, launched in July, 1978, Airbus employed its innovative skills and technological know-how to even greater effect. And, as with all future Airbus programmes, the advances made in the development of the new aircraft were fed back into the existing model, the A300.

The A310, which once again was developed in consultation with airlines, was to be a shorter, longer-range aircraft than the A300, seating 218 in a two-class configuration. It also incorporated another concept which would later become a cornerstone of Airbus' success: both models would have maximum commonality. Airbus introduced the use of lighter-weight carbon fibre reinforced plastic on secondary structures such as spoilers, airbrakes and rudder - first in trial on an A300 and then with the A310-200 when it entered service in 1983. Two years later, the A310-300 with its all-composite fin saw the first use of composites on primary structures, as well as the highly-effective addition of drag-reducing wing-tip devices which improved fuel efficiency.

The A310 also marked another step in Airbus' pioneering efforts to advance the technology of cockpits and significantly enhance the man-machine interface - thereby improving operational safety. Beginning with the A300, Airbus improved the cockpit layout, allowing a two-pilot flight crew to operate the aircraft without the need for a flight engineer. The new concept, called the Forward-Facing Crew Cockpit, went into service on an A300B4-220 delivered to Garuda Indonesia airlines in 1982, and it heralded a new era in flight decks which was to be followed by all other large aircraft manufacturers worldwide. Airbus took the next step in cockpit development on the A310, introducing electronic flight instrument displays that replaced many of the traditional analogue dials on the main instrument panel. This A310 ""glass cockpit"" used six computer-driven cathode ray tube displays to provide the captain and co-pilot with centralised flight and navigation information as well as monitoring and warning data. The glass cockpit subsequently was incorporated on the A300 as well, providing commonality between the two aircraft - an approach that was to be further developed on the other Airbus aircraft that followed.

The A310 marked the beginning of the ""Airbus family"" development and, with its lighter weight and fuel efficiency, helped attract new customers. Jean Roeder, chief engineer of Deutsche Airbus, said: ""We showed the world we were not sitting on a nine-day wonder, and that we wanted to realise a family of planes.we won over customers we wouldn't otherwise have won. The A310 supplied us with the starting point for the A300-600 we would never have had without it..What the A310 gave us was new systems technology, the efficiency and the productivity of the 'glass cockpit'...now we had two planes that had a great deal in common as far as systems and cockpits were concerned.""

The A310 also marked Britain's return to Airbus as a full partner. A new, smaller wing than that produced for the A300 had to be designed. Hawker Siddeley had by now been incorporated into British Aerospace, and as the British dragged their feet about commitment to the project there was talk of the A310 wing being produced elsewhere. Eventually the British government put up a reported £50 million in a repayable loan towards development costs and from January, 1979, British Aerospace took a 20 per cent stake in Airbus Industrie, roughly equivalent to the work it would gain from being part of the consortium. France and Germany's shares went down to 37.9 per cent each, with the rest held by CASA of Spain.

Airbus prepares first A350 for main structural tests - Flightglobal,"Mon, 28 Nov 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXByZXBhcmVzLWZpcnN0LWEzNTAtZm9yLW1haW4tc3RydWN0dXJhbC10ZXN0cy8xMDMxMzIuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has detailed its A350 main structural test campaign as it prepares to assemble the initial static airframe at Toulouse, ahead of full-scale testing in 2012.

A350 chief engineer Gordon McConnell said the fatigue test aircraft will be divided between three stations. EF1 will handle the nose sections 11, 12 and 13, while EF2 will deal with central sections 15-21, and 22, including the belly fairing and wing box. EF3 will focus on empennage sections 16-19, with a stub vertical fin.

The fatigue structures will include dummy parts for the nose and main landing gear, horizontal stabiliser and tail cone.

Airbus's first A350 in final assembly will be a static aircraft. Static testing will comprise the ES structure - a full airframe, fuselage and wing box, to provide data for first flight clearance as well as limit and ultimate load tests. A separate structure, EW, focused on the left-hand wing box, will be used for wing damage tolerance testing not performed on the ES rig, using 42 loading jacks.

EF1 will undertake 3,000 simulated flights a week. The EF2 rig - located in Erding, Germany, with the EW rig - will demonstrate fatigue of metallic parts, with simulated flights covering three design service goals. The EF3 rig is in Hamburg.

McConnell said more than 50% of the structures tests are running or have been completed as the airframer bids to ensure components achieve a high level of maturity, to reduce the risk of a lengthy programme overrun - particularly given that entry into service has already slipped to 2014.

Two development simulators have logged 300h since May, while the major integration benches and ""iron bird"" system for hydraulics and electrics assessment are also running.

The ""iron bird"" will be coupled with the simulators to create ""Aircraft Zero"". Integration tests for the high-lift system and landing gear have also started.

Five test examples of the Honeywell auxiliary power unit have completed more than 1,160h of tests, including some 3,200 starts, and APU icing certification tests have been completed. There is ""good confidence"" in the APU, said McConnell.

McConnell said more than 140 flight and ground tests - about 100 with Airbus's development jets, such as the A380 and A340, and the rest with supplier test aircraft - have been, or will be, performed to gain ""early exposure"" of A350 systems to flight conditions, before the type's flight tests.

Aircraft MSN1 will be the first flying prototype, and MSN3 will be a similar aircraft, while MSN2 will have a cabin fitted.

Among the crucial components sent to the final assembly line is the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB powerplant, delivered on 16 September. The engine for the A350-900 is the first in the Trent family to pass endurance testing first time, said the manufacturer.

Rolls-Royce has eight prototype engines, which have logged 1,200h of ground tests, and is preparing to carry out the first Trent XWB flights using a single example attached to an A380.

During a 150h regime, the engine was subjected to 17h operating at maximum red-line speeds and 42h at maximum continuous rating.

Trent XWB programme director Chris Cholerton said that for the last third of the test the manufacturer increased the temperatures, running the engine - intended to deliver 84,000lb (370Kn) thrust for the twinjet - at 91,300lb.

During strip-down and inspection of the components, the company discovered barely any damage except for some impact on a rotating seal - an issue which was easy to resolve, said Cholerton.

Cholerton said Rolls-Royce had looked at ""every disruptive event"" in the Trent family to ""check that none of the known existing service issues is present"" in the XWB.

He added that the compressor had been ""exceeding expectation"" and the performance of the engine had allowed the manufacturer to simplify the design - such as replacing a set of rotating vanes with static ones.

Early performance results gave Rolls-Royce the leeway to raise the thrust capability of the engine to 97,000lb, an increase at the heart of the A350-1000 redesign, detailed earlier this year, which lifted the type's payload-range and maximum take-off weight.

McConnell revealed that other major changes to the -1000 had been considered, including a smaller vertical fin and a mini trailing-edge device for the flaps, but said these had been ""dropped"". However, other alterations have been adopted: the main landing-gear beam attachment had been ""optimised"" and the ram-air turbine moved slightly aft.

Redesign of the -1000 has not satisfied two of its four customers - Dubai-based Emirates and Doha-based Qatar Airways - but Airbus reiterated during the Dubai air show that it would not alter the design again.

""Our opinion on the -1000 remains the same. We are not happy,"" said Qatar chief Akbar Al Baker, who even suggested Airbus would rethink the configuration.

But Airbus chief operating officer for customers, John Leahy, dismissed the idea. ""We clearly need to get a sales team to Doha to explain the aircraft,"" he said.

McConnell said: ""We have a great aircraft that can fly anywhere in the world. We're not going to change it.""

Airbus A340 - Global Security,"Mon, 07 Nov 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHNlY3VyaXR5Lm9yZy9taWxpdGFyeS93b3JsZC9ldXJvcGUvYTM0MC5odG3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus A340

In 1986, Airbus took a further leap with another new program, the A-330/340. This took shape as a single airplane that could accommodate either two or four engines. The A-330 was the twinjet version; it was larger than the A-300 and the Boeing 767. The A-340 was the four-engine version. Built for long range, it served transoceanic routes that covered world-spanning distances but attracted too few travelers.

The A340 Family spans 295-380 seats and delivers a unique combination of superior passenger comfort, economy and operational flexibility. The Family complements the A330 in extending market coverage to longer routes. A340 models are particularly well suited to operation in challenging high-temperature and high-altitude conditions.

The A340-300E typically carries 295 passengers in three classes up to 13,700km/7,400nm. The 380 seat A340-600 flies up to 14,640km/7,900nm while the ultra-long range, 313-seat, A340-500 can fly 16,600km/9,000nm, and operates over the longest non-stop routes in the world. Deliveries of the latest, 380 ton takeoff weight, versions started with an A340-600 for Qatar Airways in summer 2006 followed by an A340-500 for Thai International in April 2007. They are equipped with the latest development of the Rolls-Royce Trent 500 engines.

Only the A380 has a quieter cabin than the A340 Family. A340 passengers can enjoy travelling in one of the most comfortable cabins in service. Business Class has typically either aisle or window seats and Economy Class at eight-abreast ensures a higher percentage of these preferred seats. Airlines have the ability to customise the light, bright cabin to suit their markets using innovative options such as illumination systems that realistically simulate sunset or sunrise.

Along with excellent passenger comfort the A340 Family also offers tremendous operating efficiency, further enhanced by the ability to generate substantial cargo revenues. A340-600 customers have the option to install lower-deck toilets, galleys and crew rest facilities freeing up additional revenue-generating space for seats on the main deck.

The A340-500 and -600 maintain Airbus's leadership in lowering operating costs due to technology and innovation via use of advanced aerodynamics, materials and systems. Further aerodynamic improvement is being introduced to counter the effects of rising fuel prices. The A340-300E also benefits from reduced engine maintenance cost, improved fuel efficiency from its environmentally friendly CFM56-5C4/P engines that satisfy current and future noise and emission standards.

All A340 customers can benefit from operational commonality with other Airbus models to reduce training time and costs for pilots and engineers. The four-engine configuration allows operational planning using shortened routes over the vast expanses of inhospitable areas such as mountains, deserts and Polar Regions.

The A340-500 is in service with TAM, Emirates, Etihad Airways, Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways. It is the world's longest-range aircraft and flies the world's longest non-stop air routes, such as Singapore to Los Angeles. As of the end of 2008 almost 900 A330/A340 Family aircraft are in operation with 90 operators and there were more than 400 aircraft in Airbus' substantial backlog of orders.

Airbus conducts first A320 'sharklet' flight | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Wed, 30 Nov 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWNvbmR1Y3RzLWZpcnN0LWEzMjAtc2hhcmtsZXQtZmxpZ2h0LzEwMzI2Ny5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has completed the first flight of its A320 test aircraft equipped with 'sharklet' wing-tips.

The airframer modified the prototype of its narrowbody family (MSN001) with the approximately 2.5m (8.2ft) tall devices and has now begun the flight test programme for the certification and performance validation.

The first part of the campaign is directed at gathering data to fine-tune the aircraft's flight laws, which govern the flight control system.

Airbus expects that the sharklets will cut fuel burn by up to 3.5% over the current configuration with wing-tip fences and increase the maximum takeoff weight by up to 3t.

Starting next year, A320 wings will be manufactured with the required structural reinforcements to allow for the new wing-tip devices as an option.

The planned A320neo, which will enter service in 2015, is to be equipped with sharklets as a standard.

Airbus A300-600ST Beluga - Global Security,"Mon, 07 Nov 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHNlY3VyaXR5Lm9yZy9taWxpdGFyeS93b3JsZC9ldXJvcGUvYTMwMC02MDBzdC5odG3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus A300-600ST Beluga

The Airbus Transport International subsidiary of Airbus operates a fleet of five A300-600ST known as Belugas - one of the world's largest cargo carriers. These aircraft perform regular airlift duties for Airbus, carrying fuselage sections and wings between the different European production sites, and they also are made available for chartered commercial flights.

A wide range of commercial charter missions have been performed by Airbus Transport International, from airlifting a 17.6-metre-long x 6.5-meter-diameter chemical tank weighing 39 metric tons to transporting a large French masterpiece painting. Space hardware manufacturers use the Beluga for reliable charter flights with payloads that have included space station modules, launch vehicle hardware and the most delicate satellite payloads. A pallet-mounted heating module provides a comfortable environment for spacecraft and other cargo that requires temperature-controlled conditions. In addition, the Beluga offers unique transport capabilities for the military airlift market, providing the largest main deck cargo compartment of any aircraft available today.

The Beluga is a highly modified version of the A300-600 and features one of the widest fuselage cross-sections of any aircraft, civil or military. Its main deck cargo volume is greater than the Lockheed C-5A Galaxy, Antonov AN-124 and Boeing C-17. Tailored for the transport of heavy and voluminous cargo loads, the Super Transporter is able to carry a payload of 47 metric tonnes (103,616 lb.) over a range of 900 nautical miles (1,667 km).

SATIC prepared several ""A340 Mega Transporter"" engineering studies based on the -300 and -600 variants. One of many reasons for this was so that Airbus could increase the potential number of candidates for A380 final assembly plant. There were studies for a A340-300ST / A340-600ST (both utilising extended Beluga cargo holds) as well as a A340-600STE / A340-600STE configuration (with extended and increased cargo hold diameter) on the way. Of which the last mentioned STE version would have been able to fly around the over sized A380 components.Eventually, the sea-road transportation to TLS was chosen based on cost and [a little] on politics. According to SATIC there were no engineering showstoppers for the A340MT. The cost issue arose from the expensive base airframe (in the end the -600) married with an expensive modification (a 10m wide bubble). To make the cost issue worse, Airbus only required two airplanes (compared to say, the initial four A306STs that Airbus ordered in the early 1990s).

The Beluga features one of the widest fuselage cross-sections of any aircraft, civil or military, and its 1,400 sq. metre main deck cargo volume is greater than the Lockheed C-5A Galaxy, Antonov An-124 and Boeing C-17. A full range of outsized payloads can be handled by the Beluga, from International Space Station modules to huge chemical tanks. With a cylindrical cargo compartment cross-section 7.1 meters wide X 7.1 meters high, the Beluga can carry large helicopters with little or no strip-down/disassembly required. The cargo deck's overall length of 37.7 meters allows long payloads to be handled with ease. Relocating the Super Transporter's cockpit below its main deck level allows for easy roll-on/roll-off of cargo. The large single-piece main cargo door swings upward to provide access to the cargo compartment and provides unrestricted use of the entire main deck cargo compartment volume.

The Airbus A340, a four-engine plane with a capacity of 360 passengers, underwent maintenance in China and stopped at Air France’s main Paris hub before the missing screws were spotted in Boston.

It appeared the jet made at least one flight, the trans-Atlantic journey between Charles de Gaulle Airport and Boston, without the screws, but the airline is still working to determine when exactly the hardware disappeared.

The screws secure a panel intended to reduce drag during flight.

“At no moment was the safety of the flight in question,” Air France spokeswoman Marina Tymen told Bloomberg News.

The Airbus was first worked on during a stopover at Taeco-Taikoo Aircraft Engineering in China, leaving the facility for the Paris airport on Nov. 10.

The plane then spent three days at de Gaulle before winging its way to Boston, where the missing screws were noticed several days later, according to Air France.

It is a low cost carrier that started operations in 1996, originally as “Cebu Air.” The airline flies to 34 domestic and 16 international destinations.

Cebu currently operates a fleet of 10 Airbus A319s, 18 A320s and eight ATR 72-500s. They also have an additional 56 Airbus A320-family aircraft on order, including the A321neo.

Even with the new fleet and many changes in safety, the airline, along with every other Philippines airline, is banned from flying to the European Union. Too bad having a slick livery doesn’t help an airline become unbanned.

The original livery, seen on a DC-9, was a bit more plain, but still had the “bird head.” The newer one keeps the bird, but also incorporates yellow and orange, with the website down the fuselage. The colors go very well together and the shape in the front makes it look like the aircraft is smiling, which reminds me of the good ‘ol PSA livery.

Thanks Allen for the suggestion.

It serves as an incentive for carriers to take steps in making their fleets more fuel-efficient. In light of this development, it is worth reviewing the most fuel-efficient aircraft that are either in operation or scheduled to be rolled out in the near future – and which airlines are deploying them.

Airbus A320neo (New Engine Option)

The A320 family, which includes the A318, A319, A320 and A321, will become more fuel-efficient with the use of new engines. The A320neo will be the first of the re-engined series, scheduled to enter service in October 2015. Eventually, the enhancement will be given to the A319 and A321 jets as well. Customers of this product include Virgin America, AirAsia and IndiGo.

BENEFITS

The A320neo offers 15 per cent less fuel burn than today’s A320s.

Airbus A3250 XWB

This long-haul aircraft family, which is still under development, consists of the A350-800, A350-900 and A350-1000. The latter model of the family will be the longest, measuring 73.88m with the capacity to seat up to 375 passengers. The first of these jets is expected to be rolled out by early 2014 and customers include Emirates and Cathay Pacific (see story here).

BENEFITS

More than 50 per cent of the jets in this family will be made of lightweight composite materials, thus saving on weight and increasing efficiency. The A350-800, the shortest in the family, will see 8 per cent lower fuel burn while the A350-1000 will provide up to 25 per cent less fuel burn than competitors, such as Boeing B777s.

Airbus A380

Though this double-decker aircraft has already been in service since 2007, it is still the most fuel-efficient in the skies at present, given its size and range and in comparison to the B747 – the previous biggest aircraft. Today, a combined total of 57 A380s are in operation by six carriers – Singapore Airlines, Qantas, Emirates, Lufthansa, Air France, Korean Air and China Southern.

BENEFITS

When compared to the B747, the superjumbo offers 20 percent less fuel burn thanks to a combination of better engines and the use of lightweight composite materials.

Boeing B787-800 Dreamliner

The first Dreamliner was delivered to launch carrier All Nippon Airways (ANA) in September (see story here), three years later than scheduled. Being the first newly designed Boeing aircraft since the B777 almost 16 years ago, it boasts many innovations such as electrochromism-based “auto-dimming” windows and gaseous filtration system for better in-flight air. It can be used for both short and long distances, with a maximum range of 15,200km. Other customers include American Airlines, Qatar Airways and British Airways, all of which will receive their jets over the next few years. View our exclusive Tried and Tested of the maiden Dreamliner flight here and stay tuned for an in-depth look at the jet in our December issue.

BENEFITS

The aircraft uses 20 percent less fuel than a similarly sized B767 aircraft while offering greater comfort onboard with 60 per cent less engine noise, a system to counter turbulence and improved air quality.

Boeing B737 MAX

This version of the single-aisle B737 series is an upgrade from the current B737 aircraft in service. The re-engined aircraft, which competes with the A320neo, currently has nearly 500 orders for customers such as American Airlines and Lion Air (see story here), with deliveries scheduled for 2017.

BENEFITS

The aircraft will be up to 12 per cent more fuel efficient per seat than B737s in operation today.



Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental

The 747-8 Intercontinental was unveiled earlier this year in Seattle, with Lufthansa revealed to be its launch customer. The jetliner provides 467 seats in a three-class configuration, and with an overall length of 76.3m, it is the world’s longest passenger aircraft.

BENEFITS

The 747-8 has a 16 per cent lower carbon dioxide emissions per seat-km compared to its predecessor, the 747-400.

Airbus receives 1 372 aircraft orders between January and October - defenceWeb,"Wed, 09 Nov 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuY2V3ZWIuY28uemEvYWVyb3NwYWNlL2Flcm9zcGFjZS1hZXJvc3BhY2UvYWlyYnVzLXJlY2VpdmVzLTEtMzcyLWFpcmNyYWZ0LW9yZGVycy1iZXR3ZWVuLWphbnVhcnktYW5kLW9jdG9iZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European aircraft manufacturer Airbus said it received 1,372 orders for its aircraft in the first 10 months of the year, boosted by an order for 110 single-aisle planes from Australia’s Qantas last month.

Net orders, excluding 141 cancellations so far this year, reached 1,231, the company said on Tuesday.

Airbus added that it had delivered 418 planes in the first 10 months of the year, including 19 A380 superjumbo aircraft.

Sales of the A320neo topped 1,000 units worth US$100 billion as the European planemaker widened its lead over Boeing in a race that shows few signs of ending because of recession.

The bonanza is about twice what analysts and Airbus predicted a year ago when it unveiled a more fuel-efficient version of its bestselling jet, but worries about fuel prices have sent airlines scrambling for the A320neo.

Airbus data released on Tuesday suggested that promises made at an air show in June continued to turn into firm contracts despite escalating fears about the economy and the travel industry.

Toulouse-based Airbus said its 1,372 orders between January and October was more than three times the volume at the same stage last year and 2.5 times the 538 sales reported over the period by U.S. rival Boeing.

After taking into account cancellations, the planemakers booked net sales of 1,231 and 428 aircraft respectively.

Boeing hopes to catch up with 600 provisional orders for its revamped 737 MAX, a makeover of the world’s most-sold aircraft that, like the A320neo, will boast new engines. First, it must finish the design.

“The demand is driven by the fact that the people who get these planes first will have an advantage,” said Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia.

The two models promise double-digit percentage savings in fuel consumption thanks to engines designed by CFM, a venture between General Electric and France’s Safran and Pratt & Whitney, part of United Technologies .

The fuel savings have prompted many airlines to renew fleets to reduce one of their highest costs.

However, the sales are feeding demand from an industry that is in turmoil in many parts of the world.

Some analysts have criticised Airbus and Boeing for plans to boost production to record levels even before the new aircraft become available mid-decade.

Airlines lobby IATA has warned of tough times ahead, predicting industry profits in 2012 will fall 29 percent to US$4.9 billion.

Hours after Airbus released its sales data, U.S. carrier Republic Airways firmed up a Paris Air Show order for 80 A320neo-family planes on behalf of its Frontier unit, only to announce plans to sell or spin off the carrier.

Analysts say Airbus was anxious to get the sale to resist competition from Canada’s Bombardier.

Airbus overtook Boeing in 2003 to become the world’s largest commercial planemaker measured by deliveries.

The A320 and 737 are the best-selling models of each manufacturer and the backbone of most airline fleets. They are seen as a cash cow for bigger projects such as the Boeing 787, which entered service this month, and Airbus’ future A350.

Boeing is considering whether to turn the tables on Airbus by upgrading the 777 wide-body jet with new engines and other modifications.

Boeing sold 134 of the roughly 350-seat aircraft between January and the start of November. Airbus that was forced to respond to the threat by beefing up engines on its competing A350-1000, a model which has scored no sales this year."

Airbus received 135 firm orders worth US$13.7 billion (130 A320neo and five A380s) and 76 memorandum of understanding (MoU) worth US$6.8 billion.

Qatar Airways made the single largest firm order (50 A320neo and five A380s) worth US$6.4 billion at list prices. Firm orders for the A320neo from ALAFCO (50) and ACG (30) worth a combined US$7.3 billion demonstrates the A320neo’s strong investment appeal by lessors.

Spirit Airlines made the largest commitment at the show for 75 A320 Family aircraft (30 A320 with Sharklets and 45 A320neo) worth US$6.7 billion.

‘Comlux The Aviation Group’ signed a commitment for an Airbus ACJ321 – the first placed with Airbus for the type – expanding Airbus’ corporate jet family. This deal, worth US$99.7 million, will make Comlux the first to operate the Airbus ACJ318, ACJ319, ACJ320 and the ACJ321.

John Leahy, Chief Operating Officer, Customers commented: “The order intake at this airshow is the second best we’ve ever had at Dubai. Our A320neo has again been the star of the show. But despite some storm clouds on the horizon there is still strong market demand for fuel-efficient aircraft from airlines and lessors.”

The A320neo is a new engine option for the A320 Family entering into service from 2015 and incorporates latest generation engines and large “Sharklet” wing tip devices, which together will deliver 15 percent in fuel savings. The A320neo has over 95 percent airframe commonality making it an easy fit into existing fleets while offering up to 500 nautical miles (950 kilometres) more range or two tonnes more payload at a given range. By end of the Dubai Airshow sales of the neo have reached 1,420 orders and commitments in less than a year after launch, making it the fastest selling aircraft ever, Airbus says.

Every new order has a positive benefit for Airbus’s South African partners, their employees and their local supply chains. Aerosud supplies a variety of components for the A320 series, which Airbus delivers at a rate of 40 aircraft a month. The Centurion-based company is the exclusive supplier of A320 flap-track cans (housings) and also manufactures the A320 avionics bay racks and sheet metal parts for the wings, as well as supplying parts for other Airbus aircraft like the A350. Cape Town-based Cobham-Omnipless will benefit as it supplies satellite communications antennae for Airbus jetliners.

The continued Airbus-related manufacturing activity supports the South African government’s Industrial Policy Action Plan (IPAP2), which identifies Aerospace as a strategic industry for development.

In September last year Airbus announced it was committing over R4 billion to industrial and related activity in South Africa over the next 10 years. Of that, R500 million was for work related to the upcoming A350.

“Airbus has always had a unique relationship with South Africa,” Linden Birns, spokesman for Airbus sub-Saharan Africa said. “SAA was one of the first airlines to operate Airbus planes and will soon take delivery of a new fleet of A330-200s. In parallel, Airbus has been forming partnerships, joint ventures and various relationships with South Africa.” This includes research and development, design engineering and manufacturing of components and sub-assemblies for civil and military aircraft."

Air Pacific orders A330s in huge boost to Fiji flights - Hotel Management,"Wed, 02 Nov 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGVsbWFuYWdlbWVudC5jb20uYXUvMjAxMS8xMS8wMi9haXItcGFjaWZpYy1vcmRlcnMtYTMzMHMtaW4taHVnZS1ib29zdC10by1maWppLWZsaWdodHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BY JAMES WILKINSON

Air Pacific has finally confirmed its long-term fleet strategy through the order of three brand new Airbus A330-200 aircraft to replace the airline’s ageing fleet of Boeing 747 and 767 aircraft.

The aircraft are due for delivery from early 2013 and Air Pacific’s Managing Director and CEO David Pflieger said the widebodies would be operated on flights to Fiji from Auckland, Hong Kong, Los Angeles and Sydney.

“This decision is a significant milestone in our 60-year history because it will be our first-ever purchase of new wide-body airplanes, and these state-of-the art A330s are clearly going to be planes that our customers and the people of Fiji will be thrilled to fly,” he said.

“In addition, I can’t begin to tell you how excited our team here in Fiji is with this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to design and outfit new aircraft that will embody the beauty and spirit of Fiji and its 333 islands.”

Pflieger said the acquisition of the new A330 aircraft signalled a bright future for the Nadi-based airline.

“It’s the right plane at the right time for our company, and it will set us up for another 60 years of success,” he said. “Our exhaustive evaluation proved not only that the A330-200 was the best plane for Air Pacific, but also that the features and capabilities of this new plane will complement our world-renowned customer service and ensure our passengers enjoy a spacious, comfortable, and relaxing flight on their way to or from Fiji.

“These A330s will be equipped with the latest in cabin seats and in-flight entertainment, and their optimised 222-inch wide fuselage will accommodate more passengers and cargo than our current B767.

“ In addition, these new jetliners will have a look and feel that is truly Fijian, appropriately reflecting Air Pacific’s role as Fiji’s ambassador to the world,” he said.

Meanwhile, in a significant boost to inbound tourism to Fiji, Air Pacific has signed a codeshare agreement with American Airlines.

Subject to United States government approval, American Airlines’ code will appear on Air Pacific flights from Los Angeles and Honolulu to Nadi, along with services between Nadi and Suva.

“This new codeshare relationship will give our customers seamless connecting opportunities to new destinations in the South Pacific,” said Kenji Hashimoto, American’s Vice President – Strategic Alliances. “We look forward to working with our latest partner, Air Pacific, in providing even more travel options for all of our customers.”

Pflieger added: “Air Pacific is delighted to join forces with American Airlines to offer our customers a world-class gateway to nearly 20 American cities. This codeshare relationship will bring new and returning travelers to the idyllic islands of Fiji, one of the most pristine and popular vacation destinations in the South Pacific.

“It’s a win-win (situation)… Air Pacific’s customers have the opportunity to earn AAdvantage miles on all Air Pacific flights, and American’s customers can use their AAdvantage miles on all Air Pacific routes to enjoy our renowned Fijian hospitality, including complimentary inflight meals, drinks, entertainment, our Nadi airport lounge facilities, and express lanes through customs and immigration for our Business (Tabua) Class passengers.”"
