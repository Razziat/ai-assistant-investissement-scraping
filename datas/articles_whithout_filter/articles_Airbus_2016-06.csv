In recent years, companies from around the world have launched aircraft aimed at breaking the Airbus-Boeing duopoly.

On Wednesday, the latest challenger made its world debut in the form of the Irkut MC-21.

In addition to the Russian Irkut, there are a slew of state-of-the-art airplanes from around the world designed to challenge the Airbus A320neo family and the Boeing 737 MAX-Series.

But before we get to the challengers, lets take a look at the Airbus A320neo and the Boeing 737 MAX."
Airbus responds to customer needs with evolved A350 XWB documentation - Airbus,"Wed, 15 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE2LTA2LWFpcmJ1cy1yZXNwb25kcy10by1jdXN0b21lci1uZWVkcy13aXRoLWV2b2x2ZWQtYTM1MC14d2ItZG9jdW1lbnRhdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The A350 XWB Aircraft Structural Repair (ASR) manual, which directly responds to customers’ needs, was developed by a team of Airbus employees

The A350 XWB ushered in a new era of medium- and long-haul flight operations with its 2014 service entry. In addition to raising the bar for aircraft efficiency and meeting the rising expectations of passengers worldwide, Airbus’ game-changing twin-aisle jetliner also brought about enhanced guidelines for managing in-service damage – directly responding to customers’ needs.As the A350 XWB is a completely new programme with significant use of composite material, new design principles and associated methods had to be developed and integrated. This process resulted in creation of the completely new ASR (Air vehicle or Aircraft Structural Repair) manual, which was evolved from the former SRM (Structural Repair Manual).The new manual is delivered to operators in two steps: the first, at service entry, is for allowable damage definition and temporary repair solutions. The next comes two years later, when data related to internal structure allowable damage, repairs and permanent repair is added.As new A350 XWB derivatives are planned during the next three years, work on the manual is far from over. ""The ASR is a key deliverable for customers,"" said ASR A350 XWB project leader Jean-Philippe Albinet. ""We have a lot to do over the coming months and years to be on time with a complete set of data when new aircraft are delivered.""What airlines want most of all from the manual is simplicity in assessing the criticality of damage, according to Prosper Kuijpers, the Head of A350 XWB Repair Methods. Several criteria have to be considered – such as the location, material used, skin thickness, density of damage, proximity to fasteners and more. While this can lead to a long and complicated flowchart, airlines are keen to simplify and optimise the processes, he added.""Guaranteeing absolutely full coverage in the ASR would be extremely complex, and the workload to make the justification reports very high,” Kuijpers concluded. “We have to find the balance between the right level of coverage – addressing the most frequent in-service findings – and reducing the workload by simplifying the way we work."""
"Airbus CEO answers lack of senior women, ethnic minorities - Runway Girl Network","Thu, 02 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTYvMDYvYWlyYnVzLWNlby1hbnN3ZXJzLWxhY2stc2VuaW9yLXdvbWVuLWV0aG5pYy1taW5vcml0aWVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HAMBURG — At the question and answer session that closed the Airbus Innovation Days here in Germany’s aviation capital, Runway Girl Network asked the European airframer’s President and CEO Fabrice Brégier why zero women had presented at any sessions of the two-and-a-half day event, why so few ethnic minorities are represented in its senior management, and what Airbus’ solution was to its obvious diversity problem.

Brégier’s response on gender diversity was admirable in its ambitions. “We have not enough women. This is clear,” Brégier said bluntly. “We need to attract more women. Not just as head of communication, or HR, or Legal, but in production, in engineering, in programme management, in commercial.”

Highlighting that Airbus has several women in senior non-engineering roles, he expressed aspirations to do more, yet spoke openly of the challenges faced in the pipeline: just 15% of relevant specialist graduates are women, with Airbus’ hiring target at 25% women, and the company is currently at 25%.

“We are deliberately trying to make additional efforts,” Brégier said. “This is only one example of what we are trying to do.”

Yet the proof of Airbus’ good intentions will be in hiring — from within or from without — senior women to represent the company to media on strategic and technical subjects. Runway Girl Network has profiled women from Airbus with technical specialties, and indeed within the Hamburg aviation cluster alone there are several very senior women

Moreover, the sharp intake of breath from those present even on asking the question, and the number of women Airbus employees who approached RGN journalists privately after we asked it, demonstrate that there is substantial appetite for increased gender diversity.

It is impossible to consider Brégier’s response to the ethnicity part of RGN’s question in the same broadly positive way, however. “I think we do a lot, and by the way, if you go to Mobile, you will see many Black people,” he said. “So I invite you to see that we have a real diversity everywhere. My assistant is Black, but this is not why I selected him; it is because he is very good.”

Brégier’s response drew gasps in the room at several points in this section, and we present it here in full, unedited. The question on diversity of gender follows the discussion of ethnicity.

In Brégier’s defence, Airbus is indeed a multinational corporation and so has substantial diversity among the larger (and indeed smaller) European nations.

“Honestly, we are the most integrated company in the world,” Brégier said. “We have four main nationalities, as you know, in Europe, but we have, I think, at Airbus one hundred nationalities. So we have Chinese, we have Indians, but not only locally — we try to have them on board in Toulouse or Hamburg. So you will see, I am sure, in the next ten years, people who will take up top-level management positions which will no longer be French, German, British, Spanish, or even American, for John Leahy.”

But a majority of senior staff — unrepresentative of either Airbus’ airline customers or their passengers — and every single member of the airframer’s executive committee are men of white Western European ethnicity.

With the exception of head of marketing and strategy Dr Kiran Rao, who Brégier described as “not black, but he is not totally white”, and the regional leads, there is a notable lack of ethnic diversity in Airbus’ other senior staff. There is a similar lack of ethnic diversity among its board of directors, of whom three of twelve directors are women, all three of whom were first elected since 2015. If indeed Airbus’ staff are as diverse at specialist and managerial level as Brégier contents (and RGN has no reason to doubt him on this point), there are still questions to be answered about how the company is attracting, managing and nurturing talent.

While there is something to be said for having senior executives from multiple developed Western countries, ethnic minorities from these countries are underrepresented, as of course are women.

Moreover, while there may be an requirement for tertiary technical training in specialist and specialist management positions, the majority of these senior roles themselves require an overview and synthesis skillset rather than an in-depth specialism, so “pipeline” issues would seem less vital. It should be noted that, in contrast, the Executive Council of the Boeing Company is markedly more diverse in both gender and ethnicity than Airbus’.

Overall, Brégier’s agile and considered answer to the gender equality question stood in fairly stark contrast to his answer on diversity of ethnicity. It is somewhat difficult to believe that this question has not been asked — and a solution to Airbus’ ethnic diversity problem at least considered and begun to be put into place — before 2016.

Airbus Wants to Replace Satellites With High-Flying Drones - WIRED,"Wed, 01 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS8yMDE2LzA2L2FpcmJ1cy1uZXctZHJvbmVzLWFjdHVhbGx5LWhpZ2gtZmx5aW5nLXBzZXVkby1zYXRlbGxpdGVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When Sputnik 1 reached low Earth orbit in 1957, it did more than kick-start America's space program and send American schoolchildren scurrying for cover under their desks. It launched the satellite age. The orbiting platforms, which now number in the thousands, revolutionized communication, navigation, and watching football.

Satellites, though, are expensive to build, expensive to launch, and difficult to update once in orbit. Drones are another story. They're relatively cheap, easily launched, and readily updated. Of course, they can't stay aloft very long.

Or can they?

Airbus recently announced the successful maiden flight of its Zephyr T aircraft, a drone powered only by sunshine. Six decades after Sputnik launched the space race, the European firm joins the likes of NASA and Facebook in a race to build high-altitude drones that combine the advantages of a satellite and the flexibility of a plane. ""You don’t have to go through the rigor that current space-based satellite systems use,"" says John Del Frate, an aerospace engineer at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center.

These ""high altitude pseudo satellites,"" as Airbus calls them, won't drop bombs or deliver packages. They'll do many of the things satellites do and return periodically for new batteries or new tech. One day, swarms of solar-powered drones could monitor military or intelligence targets, track forest fires, or provide communications in an emergency. By flying far lower than satellites, drones could provide sharper photos of Earth. They could provide high-bandwidth links, using lasers to relay information to other drones or receivers on the ground, providing the sort of line-of-sight communication isn’t possible with satellites that orbit the planet and disappear over the horizon.

Fresh Real Estate

NASA's 1999 Helios prototype was among the first forays into this technology. In one experiment, NASA used boomerang-like aircraft, made of carbon fiber and Styrofoam, as an airborne cell phone tower. It was funky but graceful, with a wingspan of 247 feet and 14 electric propellers, but crashed into the Pacific near Kauai in 2003. Helios topped out at more than 96,000 feet, and was designed to stay in the air for at least 24 hours.

Flying something at those extreme altitudes, for long stretches, and on solar power, poses new challenges. For Helios, the killer was power storage. The team experimented with fuel cells, but batteries are a better choice. “Endurance is huge,” says Del Frate, who managed the program. “Anything you put up there has to be ultra-reliable. It’s kind of like your refrigerator, you just want to plug it in and forget it.”

Airbus started working on pseudo satellites in 2008, aiming to fill the ""capability gap"" between satellites in orbit and the low-altitude, limited drones of the day. In 2010, Zephyr 7 smashed the world record for longest flight without refueling (14 days). After that, the company decided to move to commercialization with two new models, the Zephyr S and Zephyr T. The British Ministry of Defense has dibs on the first two S models, and will likely use them for surveillance. Airbus just tested a one-quarter scale model of the T, which will stretch the *Zephyr S’*s 82-foot wingspan to 108 feet. It will quadruple its payload capacity to 44 pounds, enough to carry the radar and other gear military customers will want to keep airborne."

Dwarfed by huge jets all around, the mini-plane Thor was nonetheless an eye-catcher at the Berlin air show this week—the small Airbus marvel is the world's first 3D-printed aircraft.

Windowless, weighing in at just 21 kilos (46 pounds) and less than four metres (13 feet) long, the drone Thor—short for ""Test of High-tech Objectives in Reality""—resembles a large, white model airplane.

Yet to the European aerospace giant Airbus, the small pilotless propeller aircraft is a pioneer that offers a taste of things to come—an aviation future when 3D printing technology promises to save time, fuel and money.

""This is a test of what's possible with 3D printing technology,"" said Detlev Konigorski, who was in charge of developing Thor for Airbus, speaking at the International Aerospace Exhibition and Air Show at Berlin's southern Schoenefeld airport.

""We want to see if we can speed up the development process by using 3D printing not just for individual parts but for an entire system.""

In Thor, the only parts that are not printed from a substance called polyamide are the electrical elements.

The little plane ""flies beautifully, it is very stable,"" said its chief engineer Gunnar Haase, who conducted Thor's inaugural flight last November near the northern German city of Hamburg.

Lighter, faster, cheaper

Airbus and its US rival Boeing are already using 3D printing, notably to make parts for their huge passenger jets the A350 and B787 Dreamliner.

""The printed pieces have the advantage of requiring no tools and that they can be made very quickly,"" said Jens Henzler of Bavaria-based Hofmann Innovation Group, which specialises in the new technology.

The metal parts produced can also be 30-50 percent lighter than in the past, and there is almost zero manufacturing waste, added Henzler, who is managing director for Hofmann industrial prototyping.

The sky is not the limit for the technology—engineers also plan to use it in space.

In Aribus' 3D printed plane THOR the only parts that are not printed from a substance called polyamide are the electrical elements

The future Ariane 6 rocket of European space agency ESA, set to blast off from 2020, is set to feature many printed pieces.

""It brings big cost reductions on parts manufacturing,"" said Alain Charmeau, head of Airbus Safran Launchers.

Partially as a result of this, the Ariane 6 may have half the price tag of its predecessor Ariane 5.

'Radical innovations'

The new 3D printers can make pieces up to 40 centimetres (15 inches) long and is of most use in particularly complex designs.

Charmeau said Airbus is testing how to print an injection assembly for an engine that is now assembled from 270 individual pieces.

""With 3D printing, it has just three parts,"" he told AFP.

Aside from the costs savings, 3D printing also promises ecological benefits as lighter jets use less fuel and spew out fewer pollutants.

To reducing carbon emissions in aviation—with air traffic expected to double in the next 20 years—""the decisive issue is radical technical innovation in a relatively short time,"" said Ralf Fuecks, head of the Heinrich Boell foundation think tank of the German Green Party.

3D printing is certain to play a major role in this, he said at a conference at the ILA event with Airbus president Tom Enders.

The air travel industry is already convinced of the benefits, according to a survey of some 102 aviation sector players by German high-tech federation Bitkom.

Some 70 percent of respondents believed that by 2030 aircraft spare parts will be printed directly at airports, and 51 percent expect that entire planes will by then be manufactured by 3D printing.

And while it’s not full-scale, it’s certainly presenting a huge milestone to the world as a 13-foot flying drone. It’s also the perfect example of how a company like Airbus is able to use every benefit of 3D printing in creating what is obviously just a stepping stone to their eventual fleet of futuristic 3D printed jets.

The company, headquartered in France, has been an enthusiast proponent of well publicized 3D printed components in aircraft such as their A350 XWB (boasting over 1,000 3D printed parts) up until now. We’ve been following their plans to release an advanced UAV named Thor since they filed for the patent and began making it clear that they see a future for planes emerging from 3D printers, as well as announcing that indeed they had fabricated an unmanned aircraft vehicle at their plant in Hamburg.

Thor, which stands for Test of High-tech Objectives in Reality (THOR), will most likely be employed for riskier endeavors and aerodynamic investigations, all meant to impress upon the world how viable a fully 3D printed aircraft truly is, boasting:

50 3D printed parts

Two electric motors

Remote control

The UAV can be printed in less than a month’s time. Presented at a recent Berlin air show, the windowless drone weighing 46 pounds was shown off as a display of exactly what 3D printing can offer to the aerospace industry—and just a beginning at that.

“This is a test of what’s possible with 3D printing technology,” said Detlev Konigorski, who was in charge of developing Thor, and in attendance at the International Aerospace Exhibition and Air Show. ‘We want to see if we can speed up the development process by using 3D printing not just for individual parts but for an entire system.”

Every part of the propeller aircraft is 3D printed except for the obvious electrical system, which has been constructed out of polyamide.

Gunnar Haase, chief engineer of Thor, says that the plane flies beautifully and is very stable.

Certainly it’s no surprise that we’re at this point, as the relationship between 3D printing technology and both the aeronautics and aerospace industries has been just as tight as that of automotive or medical. These are all very serious applications as they require the utmost in quality and safety for those who will be benefiting from the construction.

We’ve been following Airbus continually, as they’ve certainly not been quiet about these advancements, from partnerships with companies like Alcoa to start producing 3D printed components to design challenges for drones. Airbus is certainly not alone in their vision either, as other companies such as Boeing have been quite active also, with thousands of 3D printed components already in use in their aircraft and even such innovations as 3D printed ice for use in easing certification practices.

While some may question whether a true revolution is indeed happening, or may not see 3D printing changing the world quite fast enough, these massive innovations, which show off the self-sustainability a company can suddenly possess in design along with speed, quality, and affordability, are not just impressive but unprecedented.

A small-sized pilotless aircraft made using 3D printing (additive layer manufacturing) processes is showcasing Airbus’ pioneering and innovative spirit.Airbus is using this mini aircraft project – known as THOR (Testing High-tech Objectives in Reality) – as a testbed for futuristic aircraft technologies: from 3D-printed structural parts to advanced aerodynamics and even artificial intelligence.The initial THOR version weighs approximately 21 kg. and can fit in a four-metre-by-four-metre square. It is powered by two 1.5 kW electrically-driven propellers, and 90 per cent of its structural components were 3D-printed from plastic polyamide powder.“This mini aircraft does not represent an actual airliner design Airbus is considering, rather it is a platform to enable low-risk and fast-track development of different technologies in real flying conditions,” explained Detlev Konigorski of Airbus’ Emerging Technologies & Concepts activity in Germany, who oversees the THOR project. “The first version was to test whether the slogan ‘Print me an airplane’ can be converted into reality.”A major advantage for THOR is the short lead time of 3D-printing, which significantly reduced development time for producing the technology demonstrator compared to traditional manufacturing methods. Using an existing design concept, it took approximately seven weeks to print the THOR aircraft’s 60 structural segments, followed by approximately one week for assembly and three days to fine tune the electrical systems before it was flight-ready.THOR’s initial flight occurred in November 2015, and the mini aircraft is resuming testing following its display at the recent Airbus Innovation Days exhibition and the ILA Berlin Air Show. ""The first flight was simply about flying,"" said Konigorski. ""Now, we want to generate basic data on things like altitude, speed and acceleration in a turn.”Follow-on THOR versions currently are being assembled at the new Center of Applied Aeronautical Research in Hamburg, Germany – known as the ZAL, in which Airbus is a major partner and shareholder. These aircraft will feature a modular design allowing for greater flexibility in airframe and structural testing.For example, the second THOR version will accommodate interchangeable wings, including concepts for a hexagonal wing with support structure derived from a honeycomb design; a metallic aluminium wing; and a flexible wing made from carbon-fibre reinforced plastics.Once wing testing is complete, the THOR project will focus on artificial intelligence in collaboration with the Airbus Defence and Space business unit of the Airbus Group parent company. The idea is for a THOR aircraft to land completely on its own, identifying obstacles on the runway and determining whether it is safe to touch down without support from any ground infrastructure.Another important aspect of the THOR project is the team’s “willing-to-fail approach,” which helps Airbus push the envelope of experimentation. The goal is simple: implement high-risk ideas on flying vehicles as soon as possible.“If a THOR aircraft takes off, and after 30 feet makes a nose dive back the ground, our attitude is: ‘good, let’s sweep it off the runway and come up with a better idea,’” Konigorski said. “In a few weeks, we can print a new aircraft!”"

Open Innovation - Airbus,"Wed, 08 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE2LTA2LW9wZW4taW5ub3ZhdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

In 2015, Airbus Helicopters launched the Open Innovation initiative, aimed at putting companies with innovative ideas in touch with interested parties at Airbus Helicopters. The initiative, which functions like a “match.com” service for technology, led to four new support contracts for technology applications. This month, a new website will streamline the process, making it easier than ever for innovation to step through the doors of Airbus Helicopters.

When the Open Innovation initiative launched through Airbus Helicopters’ research department, it became the first of its kind at Airbus Group: an extremely simple, effective way for small and medium enterprises (SME) to promote their technology at Airbus Helicopters. The initiative’s goal to foster exchange – of technology, solutions, and industrial brainstorming – has opened the way to new partnerships with potential suppliers, and provided a structured platform for collaboration.In an application form that requires just thirty minutes to complete, SMEs give a short description of the company and technology being proposed, and are asked to evaluate their product’s maturity and targeted benefits. Airbus Helicopters reviews each proposal. Those which generate interest are invited to a 90-minute meeting with experts, where prospects make their case. At this time, too, the manufacturer identifies where the proposal might be applied at the company.In its first year, Open Innovation received 35 applications. These ranged from a new heat-transfer method to nanoparticle-based technology. The process favors proposals that show signs of advanced development. “The best situation is to see technology which has already been applied in a domain other than helicopters, such as from the aeronautical industry,” said Jacques Le Sauce, research program manager at Airbus Helicopters. “The lowest level of maturity we consider is to have a prototype or a real scale demonstrator. That allows us to imagine if we can integrate this technology in our products.”The program’s concise application process has seen a healthy amount of success. Before Open Innovation, Le Sauce noted that suppliers and partners were often unclear of whom to contact to discuss new proposals. “The idea of Open Innovation was to make sure each proposal would be reviewed, and when possible, to organize a meeting with experts,” said Le Sauce. “It was a way to respond to the needs of suppliers.”And suppliers responded in kind, submitting proposals which demonstrate the wealth of creative thinking on tap in the industry. Last year, nine meetings were held with applicants. “This is a collaborative process,” said Le Sauce. “That’s the first thing to remember in looking for new technology, because it’s the technology holders who propose solutions and we who evaluate them.” The expert meetings put representatives from different parts of Airbus Helicopters in a room with the external SME, promoting constructive exchange for both parties. “That opens the door for discussions among experts who aren’t from the same background,” Le Sauce said. “It creates internal exchanges.”Of course, the ultimate hope is that such exchanges will help new technology get off the ground. In one case, experts heard a proposal for a bonding technology using ultraviolet light that is already being used in the automotive industry. The process, which if successful may replace an existing method, uses a special adhesive that polymerizes in an ultraviolet environment, cutting the time needed for bonding from 24 hours to just five seconds. If applied, it could drastically change the way Airbus Helicopters will install electrical harness or small equipment in the future.In line with much of its company transformation in recent years, the Open Innovation initiative highlights Airbus Helicopters’ visionary new methods of working, welcoming innovative ideas from around the world. Last year’s proposals originated from, among others, Russia, the United States, Germany, India, and Australia. The meetings with Airbus Helicopters’ experts have proven to be an opportunity for such companies to evaluate the maturity of their ideas and pitch their strengths to a receptive and discerning audience. As in the case of the UV bonding solution, such meetings can and do lead to the proposal’s acceptance and a launch of preliminary studies.Collaboration of this kind contributes to putting Airbus Helicopters at the forefront of innovation. “I think we are one of the first in our industry to propose something so simple to use,” said Le Sauce. “And clearly open to innovative companies.”"

When you’re a world-leading manufacturer of commercial aircraft, staying one or more steps ahead of the competition is critical. And because there is no magic “crystal ball” that can predict aviation trends short- or long-term, Airbus relies on an empowered Strategy team that influences all aspects of the company and its global operations.At the centre of this function is Dr. Kiran Rao, Airbus’ Executive Vice President Strategy and Marketing – who originally joined the company in 1992 and worked in several capacities before overseeing Strategy and Marketing in parallel. Setting out Airbus’ overall approach to preparing its future, Dr. Rao first explained why a single person is in charge of the two activities.“To put it simply, these two departments are inextricably linked,” he said. “Marketing is about understanding how our products meet the needs of customers and Strategy is about anticipating how those needs will evolve and proposing products and services adapted to their future business environment and the world they operate in.” Dr. Rao continued: “A major product change can take five years, a completely new aircraft eight or more. And then they’ll be flying for 30 years, so we have to think ahead.”In place of the aforementioned crystal ball is hard work. The Strategy team’s specialists identify trends by analysing the current market, macroeconomic forecasts, infrastructure development and the evolution of the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and supplier landscape. They are closely connected to the operational teams across the company, Airbus’ global business development, and provide context and orientation to Airbus’ Research and Technology activities.Dr. Rao added: “Although we publish the Global Market Forecast, most of our work is out of the public spotlight. We’re more visible when we successfully launch a new aircraft development – minor or major, an innovative service for our customers or a new partnership or joint venture which broadens Airbus’ global footprint. But our satisfaction comes from understanding the sensitivities behind the forecasts and business cases and the potential consequences of our actions.”"

Key Features of Racer

Racer is a high-speed helicopter demonstrator currently being developed by Airbus Helicopters as part of the Clean Sky 2 research programme.

Building upon the achievements of the company’s X3 technology demonstrator, Racer helps refine the aircraft’ aerodynamic configuration and brings it closer to an operational design with the objective of meeting future requirements for increase speed.

The simplicity of the concept is one of the main assets of the aircraft configuration, which combines fixed wings for energy efficient lift, propellers (so called lateral rotors) for energy-efficient propulsion and a main rotor that provides energy-efficient VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) flight capabilities.

The demonstrator’s design is optimized for a cruise speed of approximately 400 km/h and aims at validating the best trade-off between cost efficiency, sustainability and mission performance.

Development of the demonstrator relies on a wide European network of almost 40 industrial partners.

About Clean Sky

The European aeronautical sector is a global leader, comprising the talent and initiative of Europe’s centres of industry. With a steady rate of growth and need for aircraft in the thousands over the next decades, concerns have been raised about the sector’s environmental impact. Clean Sky is the European Union’s response.

Clean Sky is a joint undertaking of the European Commission and the European aeronautics industry (Airbus, Airbus Helicopters, Fraunhofer, Saab, Liebhrerr, Rolls Royce, and others), and is part of the EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. Its mission is to develop innovative, cutting-edge technology with the goal of making a substantial positive impact on noise reduction, CO2 emissions, and fuel economy.



With a budget consisting of contributions on a 50/50 basis, made by the Commission and the aeronautical industry, Clean Sky delivers technology demonstrators in all segments of civil air transport, grouped into areas called integrated technology demonstrators (ITD).



Under the management of the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking (CSJU) the programme’s fi rst phase, Clean Sky 1, put each ITD under the leadership of two industry leaders. Examples of successful demonstrators include Airbus Helicopters’ Bluecopter which, by optimising the design of certain shapes on the fuselage of an H135 helicopter, successfully showed improvements in drag reduction; and the Tech 800 demonstration engine, which showed advances for small- and medium-size helicopter engines with savings of 15 percent fuel burn.



“Such demonstrators incorporate mature technology – developed through the talent of industry, universities, research centres and small and medium–size enterprises – into full-scale demonstrators. The result is a rapid evaluation and testing that helps bring advanced levels of maturity to projects’ designs and techniques,” said Éric Dautriat, Executive Director of Clean Sky. “With this, the hoped-for end result is implementing innovative technology in future products and markets.” The technology of the Tech 800 demonstration engine, for example, was integrated into the product development of the new Turbomeca ARRANO engine, recently selected as the engine of Airbus Helicopters’ H160.



Following on the progress of CS1, Clean Sky 2 – which represents a budget of €4 billion over seven years (2017 to 2024) – will deliver break-through technology which will be incorporated, from 2025 onwards, into future generations of aircraft

New office facilities provide modern and dynamic work spaces, driving creativity, integration and collaboration between teams and functions

Concludes the integration of the former Paris and Munich Headquarter sites

Honours European Aviation Pioneers

Toulouse, 28 June 2016 – Airbus Group SE (stock exchange symbol: AIR) has today inaugurated its new headquarters facilities, called “Wings Campus”, adjacent to the airport in Toulouse-Blagnac, France.

Housing 1,500 employees, the new campus is located at the heart of Airbus’s production and engineering activities and comprises the Group headquarters as well as integrated services buildings. From ground-breaking to the start of operations, construction works were completed within 25 months; the new facilities at the “Wings Campus” include a variety of modern features designed to enhance the working environment and work-life-balance such as collaborative office space, a 5,000 square meters canteen, a fitness centre, outdoor sports facilities, a Starbucks café and an outdoor WiFi connection. The energy-efficient buildings are heated and cooled using geothermal energy.

“The Wings Campus, with all its new elements, stands for our commitment to innovation, internationalisation and sustainable growth,” said Tom Enders, Chief Executive Officer of Airbus Group, at the inauguration ceremony. “We strive to be a responsible, open-minded, innovative and future-oriented industry player – and want our employees to embrace this spirit. For that, we also must provide a state-of-the-art working environment. These new facilities are testament to this global commitment and I would like to express my sincere thanks to all who have contributed to this effort over the past two years. Most important for me personally: With our new Headquarters next to the airport runway, we are as close to our flying products as safely possible. That gives me an extra thrill!”

At the same time, Enders reflected on Europe’s successful aviation heritage during the inauguration event by stressing the link between early pioneers and what is today Europe’s largest aerospace company. In the presence of a number of high-ranking guests such as the Préfet of the Languedoc-Roussillon-Midi-Pyrénées Region, Pascal Mailhos, the Mayor of Blagnac, Bernard Keller, and the Mayor of Toulouse, Jean-Luc Moudenc, Tom Enders unveiled street signs on the campus bearing the names of a number of famous pioneers.

The aviators being honoured with street signs are Jacqueline Auriol (1917-2000), Amy Johnson (1903-1941), Melitta Gräfin Stauffenberg (1903-1945) and José Ortiz-Echagüe (1886-1980). The Group also paid tribute to CaptainEric ‘Winkle’ Brown (1919-2016), whose name adorns a restaurant on the campus. Several descendants of these aviation pioneers attended the inauguration event.

“Very few of our pioneers could have imagined in their lifetime that today our nations have come together to make things fly under one Airbus flag,” Enders said. “It is the passion and courage of such pioneers that has paved the way for Airbus. We wouldn’t be here celebrating the opening of our new campus without them. I pay a special tribute to these three female pilots and engineers. They not only remind us of our complex and diverse history but they also underline the key role women have played in the successful evolution of European aviation. We hope that their legacy also inspires more young women to join our industry.”

The opening of the new Campus concludes the Headquarters move that the Group had initiated in 2013. It led to the sale of sites at Munich (Unterschleißheim) and Paris (Montmorency), the proceeds of which were used to fully finance the new campus in Toulouse-Blagnac.

Annex – Biographical Data

Jacqueline Marie-Therèse Suzanne Auriol, née Douet

(born November 5, 1917, Challans, Vendée; deceased February 11, 2000, Paris)

Jacqueline Auriol was a French aviatrix who set several world speed records. After graduating from the University of Nantes she took up her studies at the Ècole du Louvre in Paris.

In 1937, she married Paul Auriol, son of Vincent Auriol who became President of France in 1947.

After a severe crash in an aircraft in 1949, she underwent 33 surgical operations over a period of three years. During that time she studied algebra, trigonometry, aerodynamics, and other subjects necessary to become a professional test pilot.

She earned her military pilot license in 1950 then qualified as one of the first female test pilots in France. In 1953, she became the second woman to break the sound barrier in a Mystère IV and was later to become the first female pilot of the Concorde, as co-pilot to André Turcat.

Between 1951 and 1963, she set five world speed records, always in competition with her US-rival Jacqueline Cochran.

Her speed records started in 1951 with a Vampire and a speed of 818 km/h and finished in 1963 with 2,038 km/h in a Mirage IIIR.

Amy Johnson

(born 1 July 1903, Kingston upon Hull, deceased 5 January 1941, Thames Estuary)

Amy Johnson was a pioneering British aviatrix and might still be considered Britain´s most famous female pilot today.

She went to Sheffield University and completed a BA in Economics, before moving to London, where her flying career started at the London Aeroplane Club in 1928/29.

Johnson soon became a hero for being the first woman to fly solo from Britain to Australia. She took off in Croydon on 5 May 1930 and landed after 11,000 miles on 24 May in Darwin / Australia.

This epic flight was followed by another solo flight from England to Cape Town / South Africa in 1932 and again in 1936.

In the same year she married the Scottish pilot Jim Mollison, with whom she flew in a DH Dragon nonstop from South Wales to the United States in 1933 and nonstop from England to India in record time in 1934.

With the outbreak of World War II she joined the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA) whose task was to ferry Royal Air Force aircraft around the country.

On 5 January 1941, she was to ferry an Airspeed Oxford from Prestwick via Blackpool to RAF Kidlington near Oxford. Presumably she went off course in adverse weather and her aircraft crashed into the Thames estuary. The circumstances of her premature death are still not clear and remain a mystery to this day.

Melitta Gräfin Stauffenberg, née Schiller

(born 9 January 1903, Krotoschin, deceased 8 April 1945 near Straubing)

Melitta Gräftin Stauffenberg was a German aviatrix who served as a test engineer in the German aviation industry and the Luftwaffe.

She studied mathematics, physics and engineering, eventually specialising in aeronautical engineering at the Technical University of Munich, where she graduated cum laude in 1927.

In 1928, she started working for the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt (DVL), and from 1936 on, she developed navigation and steering systems for flying boats such as the Ha139 and the Dornier Do 18 at the Askania Company in Berlin.

In 1937, she married the historian Alexander Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg and on 28 October 1937, she became one of the first German women to be awarded the honorary title of Flugkapitän (flight captain), being one of the very first female test engineers. From 1939 on, she amassed over 2,500 demanding test flights in dive bombers in Rechlin and Berlin-Gatow, (mainly) to evaluate her own design work.

In 1944, she was arrested with other Stauffenberg family members on suspicion of conspiring with her brothers-in-law to assassinate Adolf Hitler, but she was later released to continue her engineering and test flight duties.

Countess von Stauffenberg died after being shot down, while piloting a light Buecker airplane by an Allied fighter on 8 April 1945 near Straubing /Bavaria.

José Ortiz-Echagüe

(born 2 August 1886 in Guadalajara, deceased 7 September 1980 in Madrid)

José Ortiz-Echagüe, known as Don José, graduated at the age of 17 from the military academy in his home town. He became a balloonist and was one of the first people to take reconnaissance photos from a balloon, doing so in Africa.

In 1911, he was one of the very first to acquire the Spanish pilot´s licence, his document bearing the serial number 3. He then made a name for himself by undertaking various spectacular flights.

In 1914, he returned to civilian life and worked for a short time in France, then as an engineer in the railway works in Zaragoza. It was here that the first Spanish aircraft was also to be built. It completed its maiden flight on 3 April 1915. The reproduction of six French Parasol aircraft also took place at this time.

From 1917, he set up the “Electromecánica de Cataluña” company in Madrid, which manufactured spare parts for the aircraft industry.

In 1923 he became a founder father of CASA, where he subsequently occupied various top positions until his death. Don José held the position of President and CEO of CASA from

1966 to 1970.

A further task he took was that of a chairman and managing director at the newly founded car builder SEAT.

Captain Eric Melrose ‘Winkle’ Brown, Royal Navy

(born 21 January 1919, Leith, Scotland; died 21 February 2016, Redhill, England)

Eric Melrose Brown – universally known as Winkle – dominated flight testing for 20 years, including achieving three absolute world aviation records and flying as pilot-in-command of 487 types, among them the first jet and rocket-powered aircraft and first-generation helicopters.

He gained his nickname of Winkle by being the shortest pilot in the Fleet Air Arm. He survived 23 catastrophic accidents as an operational pilot and test pilot.

As a naval aviator, he also achieved notable successes in making 2,407 aircraft carrier deck landings and 2721 catapult launches (both these being world records unlikely to be surpassed), landing the first jet aboard a carrier, deck-landing the first twin-engined aircraft and teaching the first US astronauts how to be naval test pilots.

A fluent German speaker, Captain Brown was selected to lead the creation of the Marineflieger in 1958 and maintained his close relationship with European aviation throughout his long life including consulting on the Airbus A380 programme, giving his experience of near-transonic flight characteristics.

Throughout his life, he was passionate about aviation and educating the young on the merits of flight. In his later years, he lectured widely in Europe and as far afield as India and California. His personal interest and encouragement led countless young men and women to embrace aviation and aerospace as careers. He believed that people could achieve their dreams with passion and commitment, just as he had done."

A Chinese consortium has signed a purchasing contract with a firm order of 100 H135s to be assem

A Chinese consortium made up of China Aviation Supplies Holding Company (CAS), Qingdao United General Aviation Industrial Development Company (Qingdao United) and CITIC Offshore Helicopter Co. Ltd (COHC) has ordered 100 H135 light-twin helicopters, becoming China’s first customer to form an industrial partnership to launch a H135 final assembly line (FAL) in Qingdao, Shandong province. This is an important step forward, fulfilling the commitment of purchasing 100 H135s signed in the Letter of Intent (LOI) last year.

The contract signing ceremony was held at the Great Hall of People, in the presence of Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and the visiting German Chancellor Angela Merkel, marking a significant milestone in the scene of local general aviation industry with this €700 million sales contract and the industrial partnership of a final assembly line (FAL) in Qingdao. The FAL is expected to start operations by 2018, to assemble 100 H135s over the next 10 years.



“We are extremely pleased with the progress of this partnership between Airbus Helicopters and our Chinese partners. With the further opening up of the Chinese skies and the increasing growth in the civil and parapublic segments, China is gearing up to be the biggest market for helicopters in years to come,” said Norbert Ducrot, Head of Airbus Helicopters China and North Asia region. “With their inherent versatility and reliability, these 100 H135s will be best suited to meet the soaring demand in China”.



The H135 has gained popularity in China in recent years, performing various parapublic missions such as helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS), law enforcement, firefighting, patrol command, and search and rescue (SAR), as well as corporate missions such as tourism and transportation.



The rapid development of offshore wind power generation industry in China also presents a new market segment for helicopter operations. The H135 is an excellent solution for these missions thanks to its compact external dimensions, a comparatively small rotor diameter, an optimised cabin size and ideal twin-engine performance. Together with the growth of other segments, a potential demand of 600 light twin-engine helicopters is expected in the next 20 years.



To date, nearly 1200 H135s are delivered globally and in operation, having logged more than three million flight hours.

SB-S will mark a paradigm shift in aviation safety and efficiency. Using Inmarsat’s global L-band satellite network, it delivers much faster data and voice communications due to its unprecedented speed and capacity, which are several orders of magnitude greater than cockpit communications systems in the market today.

These advanced capabilities will transform the quality and security of cockpit communication and information shared between pilots, air traffic controllers and airlines, with Inmarsat’s satellite technology also ensuring consistent, high-speed global coverage for SB-S.

Airlines around the world will also benefit from a myriad of new digital applications never before available, including continual positional awareness for flight tracking, flight data streaming (also known as ‘Black Box in the Cloud’), and electronic flight bag applications for pilots, such as graphical weather for improved situational awareness.

The selection of SB-S by Airbus reinforces Inmarsat’s status as the world’s leading provider of satellite safety services, serving around 95% of the world’s long-haul aircraft.

The inclusion of the A320 family will also position SB-S as an advanced Light Cockpit Satcom solution on single-aisle Airbus aircraft, marking an exciting new era for the aviation industry. The selection was possible as SB-S is delivered via advanced airborne equipment that addresses factors which have traditionally impacted demand in the single-aisle market, such as size, weight and cost. Around eight out of ten commercial aircraft in the world are single-aisle.

Captain Mary McMillan, Inmarsat Aviation’s Vice President, Safety and Operational Services, said: “We are delighted that Airbus has selected SwiftBroadband-Safety for its A320 and A330 aircraft families. This is testament to SwiftBroadband-Safety’s ability to deliver an always on, always secure cockpit solution for the digital age, with expanded connectivity and reliability.

“Inmarsat has been delivering critical safety information to the world’s airlines, private jet operators and government agencies for over two-and-a-half decades. In the past, these services were almost exclusively utilised by airlines travelling in areas not served by traditional radar, such as routes over the ocean or remote locations. However, with growing aircraft congestion and the need for increased data security, Inmarsat is engineering a new generation of satellite communication services to provide a wider range of benefits.

“SwiftBroadband-Safety will introduce unprecedented new capabilities, allowing airlines to significantly improve flight safety operations and provide a more efficient service to passengers. Airlines also benefit from continuous monitoring of aircraft performance and fuel usage.”

Inmarsat’s partner Cobham SATCOM has been selected by Airbus to provide the equipment that delivers SB-S service onboard the A320 and A330 aircraft families. The equipment, known as the AVIATOR 200S and 700S, will provide a seamless connection between the aircraft cockpit and Inmarsat’s extensive global satellite network. Under Cobham’s contract with Airbus, the equipment will be fitted onto the aircraft from 2018.

Kim Gram, Vice President of Aero Satcom at Cobham Satcom, said: “Inmarsat has made an immense contribution in the forward progression of our industry, from the development of the original idea of smaller and lighter satcom hardware, continuing its influential work in industry standardization groups, to the ultimate deployment of services on its global satellite network.”

Innovation on-board: Exceeding passenger and airline expectations for Airbus jetliner cabins - Airbus,"Thu, 16 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE2LTA2LWlubm92YXRpb24tb24tYm9hcmQtZXhjZWVkaW5nLXBhc3Nlbmdlci1hbmQtYWlybGluZS1leHBlY3RhdGlvbnMtZm9yLWFpcmJ1c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Covering all Airbus aircraft programmes, the company’s cabin interior arrangement team works closely with customers and Aibus’ marketing department to deliver cabin solutions that improve passenger experiences and airline operations

Airbus’ cabin interior arrangement team is turning airlines’ ideas into real solutions – and bringing the superior cabin experience of an Airbus aircraft to passengers around the world.This dedicated team of some 20 members works in close collaboration with customers and the Airbus marketing department to ensure that each cabin layout meets operator expectations in terms of comfort and efficiency, while also conforming to regulatory and technical requirements.With its activities covering Airbus’ entire modern, market-leading product line of single-aisle and widebody jetliners, the team can create several new cabin layouts per day for cabin definition, customisation, core engineering or retrofit projects, as well as future research and technology initiatives.Cabin layout is a core competency for Airbus – with the company launching a recent initiative to further enhance the cabin arrangement process for customers, facilitate relationships with suppliers and harmonise ways of working across all aircraft programmes.""We have to put ourselves in the shoes of the airline, and consider what they really want,"" said Garrett Smith, an Airbus Interior Arrangement Manager for the A330 Family. ""We know that they need to be economical, they need the comfort and the service, but we also need to identify the finer points that differentiate their request from any other so we can propose a solution that makes them say, 'that's exactly what I asked for.'""This customer- and passenger-focused philosophy is at the heart of all Airbus aircraft cabins, which bring together the best in innovation and design with the perfect blend of features and services – all to provide a superior flying experience. ""Our team helps ensure that Airbus offers the most optimised configurations,"" said Benoît Peyrard, an Airbus Interior Arrangement Manager for the A380.The company’s interior layout expertise has played an important role in shaping its latest products and preparing the future. For example, on the all-new the A350 XWB, the cabin team develops innovative and customised cabin layouts by coordinating with airline customers to select the jetliner’s standardised options of pre-developed cabin furnishing solutions – as well as the highly customisable features for servicing and comfort.This improves customer satisfaction for operators and streamlines Airbus’ industrial processes, explained Christelle Vetter, Head of A350 XWB Cabin Interior Definition. ""We are involved from the very beginning and when we see that the customer is happy with their optimised aircraft, there is a real sense of satisfaction.”In addition to the A350 XWB, Airbus also has utilised this cabin team for other upgrades to its highly-efficient product line. This includes the design of new cabin options for the single-aisle A321neo (new engine option) and widebody A330neo, which configure the interiors for a more flexible and efficient layout that maintains the jetliners’ high comfort standards and competitiveness.No matter the aircraft, finding solutions that enable the success of airline operators and maximise the passenger experience often comes down to the smallest details, and the Airbus cabin interior arrangement team looks for every possible advantage.“Operators challenge us to get the most out of each inch,” concluded Claire Chagneau, an Airbus Interior Arrangement Manager for single-aisle aircraft. “If we can gain an inch for crew operation or passengers it is a big success!”"

Black Box in a Cloud among tools to be available on Airbus types - Runway Girl Network,"Thu, 30 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTYvMDYvYmxhY2stYm94LWluLWEtY2xvdWQtYW1vbmctdG9vbHMtdG8tYmUtYXZhaWxhYmxlLW9uLWFpcmJ1cy10eXBlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With modified versions of Inmarsat’s SwiftBroadband-based cockpit communications solution, SB-Safety (SB-S) already being successfully trialled by Hawaiian Airlines and FedEx, the solution could soon receive an important recommendation from the FAA’s Performance-based Operations Aviation Rulemaking Committee (PARC), which would allow other countries and operators to adopt it.

But Airbus is already convinced that the latest iteration of SB-Safety – which will boast new digital applications including continual positional awareness for flight tracking, ‘Black Box in the Cloud’ flight data streaming functionality and connected ‘electronic flight bag’ applications for pilots – is right for the A320 and A330, having confirmed it will offer the platform with equipment from Cobham’s AVIATOR S Series as line-fit on both families of aircraft. It’s believed that SB-S will be available across Airbus’ full portfolio, including the A350 in time.

This morning RGN interviewed Inmarsat Aviation’s VP, safety and operational services, Captain Mary McMillan about what the announcement means for the industry. Our full Q&A is below.

Under Cobham’s contract with Airbus, the lightweight AVIATOR 200S and 700S hardware to support SB-Safety on the A320 and A330 families, respectively, will be fitted onto the aircraft from 2018. Is SB-Safety ready for primetime today?

MM: There are several countries around the world where SB-S has unlimited approval to operate and one of the reasons they allowed it to be evaluated in that manner is SwiftBroadband has been around for quite some time, the platform is steady, they know about its Internet and ground capabilities, and it has been operating without restriction for safety services. So the next steps are, at the next FAA PARC meeting in Washington DC, we’re hoping that the recommendation from that committee is that SB-S performs well, and there is no real certification or approval processes but a recommendation that will allow other countries and operators to adopt it wholesale. And this is an industry government organization … formulated for the reason to look at the new technologies that we [as an industry are] transitioning into. We [at Inmarsat] are offering SB-S to airlines today; obviously the Airbus announcement indicates that Airbus is going to be offering it linefit in two of their fleets, leading to full-fleet installation in the not too distant future. There are a couple of different versions available and what is operating today on Hawaiian and FedEx is Cobham terminals modified to deliver safety services. So the newer, more modern digital security-enabled versions of those is what will be on the Airbus fleet and also available for retrofit.

What does SB-S offer in terms of baseline functionality?

MM: The ability to deliver ADS-B and CPDLC messaging, ACARS over IP – that creates the safety function. You’ll have an always on, always secure IP channel dedicated to cockpit services, so rather than using a cabin broadband channel and adapting it for use in cockpit, this is prioritizing and able to tap into the protected spectrum, using a secure IP channel, so the major difference is that it has the segregation that builds in cyber security protection but also has preemption and priority capability to ensure that any safety-related message is utilizing that channel. In terms of growing the services that are going to require this safe IP pipe that are dedicated purely to cockpit services, we believe it will continue to explode. There are things that we could only dream about just a few years ago that weren’t possible but now they are and I think we’re right at the very beginning of a step change that will see vast improvements and an increased tool set for better efficiency and a greater margin of safety.

With this solution in place, it opens up provisioning of digital aviation safety applications, including continual positional awareness for flight tracking and the ‘Black Box in the Cloud’. Is there pressure in the market to adopt the latter in the wake of some notable recent tragedies, like MH370?

I think it’s too early to say that we’ve seen pressure in the market. One of the reasons we have [traditional] black boxes is that they are mandatory; we have them for very good reasons. With the information we pull down off the black boxes, those are used routinely every day to make an operation better and then in the event of a catastrophic situation, we use them [to help understand what happened]. The original black boxes could do magnetic tape and 27 parameters; digital ones can record thousands of parameters, but the reason we had them was that was the extent of the technology. Now rather than having a physical thing on the airplane that you have to find in the event that an airplane is lost, you have that ability to pull that information down.

We need to really differentiate between flight tracking and the ability to stream data; tracking tells us where the aircraft is, but doesn’t tell us anything about what’s happening to it. It’s streaming flight data that tells us what’s happening, understanding if a distress situation is developing, understanding the factors creating that situation; that’s important information … I don’t know that we will ever live stream all of the data [from an aircraft], because there are some aircraft that generate gigantic amounts of data; the Boeing 787 does 500 gigabytes of data. Certainly there are parameters – and my understanding from NTSB is there are 70-100 [of these] – that in the event of a distress situation we’d like to stream as a triggered event, but also be able to download that information that has already been collected that leads up to that event. It gives you a “before and after”, which is critical key information. In terms of triggering [a transmission in the event of an emergency], this is obviously something that ICAO is grappling with at the moment, but I see there will be multiple options, the ability to trigger from the ground and in the air. As we continue to work on this and explore possibilities, I think we’ll be able to come up with a set of options that are performance based and based on the level of criticality of the situation. I look at my own flight manuals and my aircraft information manuals and they are divided into normal and abnormal procedures, so I think it will be relatively straightforward for the aviation safety community to come to agreement about whether the situation … would warrant continuous flight tracking and ultimately trigger the stream of data.

How quickly can such data be available?

So basically that information would be available microseconds after the time it takes to transmit to a ground station, 3-5 seconds with SB Safety, the performance is astounding … So the tech is there, is available, but one of the big issues around this will be, how we actually handle the data so it’s obviously confidential data with a lot of sensitivity around it for a number of different stakeholders so who has the right to access the data, where does it go to, what can it be used for? Those are a couple of questions already on the minds of different regulators so that’s actively being worked at the moment as well … It will be available to appropriate authorities to inject that into programs to pick that raw data and turn it into information. The hope is that there is obviously infrastructure [in place]; you need to interpret that data and create useful information out of that, and the hope is that we’d be able to understand in near real-time what’s developing, and thereby provide additional resources to that aircraft. Some airlines are already streaming a very limited data set over ACARS but now we’re giving them a gigantic pipe … They can augment in a significant way the info they’re pulling down from the aircraft. There are airlines that have developed their own set of parameters that if something falls within that parameter, they want aircraft to start delivering information. That’s one of the reasons we got ACARS messages from Air France 447, and that’s what we received from Egyptair 804, but it was limited data sets running over the old traditional pipe.

Where do you stand with securing a similar agreement with Boeing?

Cobham has announced they have a TSA with Boeing for the 737NG [plus MAX] and the 777 including the 777X …. So we’re achieving similar success on the Boeing side as well as with Airbus.

What are the retrofit considerations for operators that carrying Inmarsat Classic services, for instance?

There are a lot of factors involved in that; first the aircraft that have older Classic [safety services] equipment is like having a big rotary dial telephone on the airplane. It’s functional and can make the call and send the data, but it’s heavy … So we’re going to develop a series of incentives to incentivize airlines to consider a retrofit option to SB-S to maintain and carry on safety applications, and now to future proof them to start identifying those applications that will work for their operators to increase efficiency.

[Editor’s note: SB-S operates over Inmarsat’s L-band-based SwiftBroadband service, which is available globally except for the poles.]"

Inside Cathay Pacific's Brand New Airbus A350 - The Points Guy,"Wed, 01 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS8yMDE2LzA2L2NhdGhheS1wYWNpZmljLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available. View the current offers here: Citi Prestige

This week, Cathay Pacific took delivery of its very first A350. The airline is perhaps best known for its fantastic first-class product — which unfortunately isn't available on this latest addition to the fleet. Still, Airbus' answer to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner arguably offers one of the most comfortable rides in the sky — seat configurations are typically identical to what you'll find on the 787, but the A350 cabin measures nearly half a foot wider, allowing for nearly an extra inch of width in economy.

Cathay's A350 offers three cabins, consisting of 38 business class seats (arranged in a 1-2-1 configuration), 28 premium economy seats (2-3-2) and 214 seats in coach (3-3-3). The plane can fly more than 9,000 miles, allowing Cathay Pacific to operate service to pretty much anywhere on the globe. For now, the A350 will fly within Asia, with service to Europe launching later this year.

Let's take a look inside...

Economy Class

The majority of passengers will be flying in Cathay Pacific's economy cabin, which features 214 seats in total.

There's not too much to get excited about when it comes to economy seating, however Cathay does offer a unique headrest design, which should add a bit of comfort.

The adjustable headrest offers slide-out panels, designed to make the seat much more comfortable when it comes time to sleep.

Each economy seat has on-demand entertainment, as you'd expect, with a large touchscreen panel on the back of the seat in front.

You may unsubscribe at any time.

There's a tray table, of course, but Cathay's economy seat also includes a unique addition — a slide-out tablet and cup holder.

The tablet holder will certainly come in handy if you opt to bring your own entertainment on board.

You can choose to store your smartphone there, instead — storage is always at a premium in economy class, so some passengers will certainly appreciate this addition.

USB charging is now standard on many long-haul planes, including the A350.

The tray table is a bit smaller than what you'll find with older economy seats, but it's still large enough to accommodate a 12-inch MacBook.

Economy passengers also receive a decent-looking pillow.

Premium Economy Class

Moving on to premium economy, this cabin offers a total of 28 seats arranged in a 2-3-2 configuration. Cathay's standard premium economy seats have been updated a bit for the A350, but they're largely the same as what you'll find on the 777-300ER — and in business class on the airline's regional fleet.

There's plenty of connectivity, including a dedicated USB charging port and a universal power outlet for each seat. This aircraft also offers satellite Wi-Fi.

Each seat has a dedicated drink table, which slides out from the center console.

There's also a full-size fold-out tray table.

The armrests offer an adjustable height, so you can raise and lower them as you wish.

There's also a reading lamp built into the seat.

Premium economy seats include a fold-out footrest (controls above), and offer quite a bit more recline than regular coach. There's also a handy compartment for storing a passport, tablet and other valuables during the flight.

As with regular economy, the premium cabin offers a dedicated tablet holder, which folds out from just under the touchscreen display.

Passengers receive a slightly larger pillow.

Comforters are available as well in premium economy.

Business Class

The business-class seats on the A350 are similar to those found on Cathay's existing long-haul fleet, including the 777-300ER.

Seats lie completely flat, as you'd expect, but you can also lower the armrest to add even more sleeping space.

Seats are arranged in a 1-2-1 configuration, giving passengers plenty of space and privacy.

Each seat has a flip-out display loaded with on-demand entertainment, which can be selected using the touchscreen controller.

Cathay's already known for its excellent service in all classes, which extends to the A350, of course.

How to Fly Cathay's A350

For the next few months, you'll need to catch Cathay Pacific's A350 on flights within Asia, but the airline plans to launch service to Europe soon, beginning with Dusseldorf on September 1 and London Gatwick on September 2. Award availability is decent in all three cabins on both routes, with up to five seats available in business class on some flights.

Believe it or not, your best bet is to redeem Alaska Mileage Plan miles for these flights between Europe and Hong Kong. A one-way flight will set you back just 42,500 miles in business class, 35,000 miles in premium economy or 30,000 miles in coach. You can also opt to redeem 75,000 AAdvantage miles for business or 35,000 for economy. You'll want to avoid redeeming Avios for premium-cabin travel — British Airways requires 30,000 Avios each way in coach, but 60,000 in premium economy and 90,000 each way in business class.

Do you have plans to fly Cathay Pacific's new A350?

The plane was put to the bottom of the sea off the resort of Kuşadası, in Aydin province, 50 miles south of Izmir.

The sinking of the plane, which is 54 metres (177ft) long and has a wingspan of 44 metres, is aimed at promoting artificial reef diving, which is hugely popular with experienced divers. Once sunk, the plane acts like a reef, becoming a magnet for underwater flora and fauna.

The 36-year-old aircraft was bought by Aydin municipality from a private aviation company for 270,000 Turkish lira (£64,000).

Turkey is looking for new ways to promote its tourism industry, which is expected to suffer a battering this year due after several deadly attacks.

Hundreds of people watched the two-and-a-half hour sinking on nearby boats, cheering and blasting their foghorns as the nose of the plane finally went down, video images showed. Aydin’s mayor, Özlem Çerçioğlu, said: “Our goal is to make Kuşadası a centre of diving tourism. Our goal is to protect the underwater life. And with these goals in mind, we have witnessed one of the biggest wrecks in the world.”

Along with offices and parking space for stored aircraft, the complex houses the engineering division of British Airways, which is charged with keeping the airline's fleet in the air.

The largest two hangars, which are adjacent to its crew training center (where I piloted a Boeing 747 simulator two months ago), are big enough to house BA's biggest aircraft, the Airbus A380. First built in the 1950s during the days of the British Overseas Airways Corporation, BA's predecessor airline, they have been enlarged several times as commercial aircraft grew continually bigger. Before the airline's first A380 arrived in 2013, crews had to cut a slot at the entrance of each hangar to accommodate the aircraft's 79-foot (24-meter) tail fin.

On June 21, the day before BA accepted delivery of its twelfth A380 (and the last in its original order), I had the chance to tour the hangar as one of the airline's massive A380s was undergoing an engine change. The airliner had arrived at Heathrow that morning from Johannesburg, but was pulled from service temporarily to fix a non-critical oil pressurization issue.

Capturing and storing carbon dioxide in underground wells has the potential to become the most consequential technological deployment in the history of the broader biofuels industry. Deploying effective carbon capture and storage at biofuels plants will cement ethanol and biodiesel as the lowest carbon liquid fuels commercially available in the marketplace. The Carbon Capture & Storage Summit will offer attendees a comprehensive look at the economics of carbon capture and storage, the infrastructure required to make it possible and the financial and marketplace impacts to participating producers.View More"
Why Airbus wants slime from green algae to fuel its planes - The Christian Science Monitor,"Thu, 16 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNzbW9uaXRvci5jb20vVGVjaG5vbG9neS8yMDE2LzA2MTYvV2h5LUFpcmJ1cy13YW50cy1zbGltZS1mcm9tLWdyZWVuLWFsZ2FlLXRvLWZ1ZWwtaXRzLXBsYW5lc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Your next flight could be powered by slime. As long as you don't fly for a few decades.

Airbus researchers are growing algae for biofuel in tanks near Munich, just one in a growing number of efforts to make flying more environmentally sustainable.

But algae won't fuel the commercial flights any time soon, says researcher Thomas Brueck, an associate professor of industrial biocatalysis at Munich Technical University, who predicts algal biofuel could supply up to 5 percent of jet fuel needs by 2050.

“To substitute 100 percent of the kerosene use today, we will not do it with algae alone,” Professor Brueck told Reuters. “We need a combination of different technologies to actually enable that substitution.”

Because the aviation and shipping industries are on pace to contribute nearly half of all carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, algal fuel might not be the sole answer to curbing the airline industry’s fossil fuel addiction.

But these and other efforts to develop commercially practical biofuel point to an industry committed to discovering a sustainable solution.

Although emissions from air travel contribute only two percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, they contribute about 12 percent of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from all transportation sources, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency, as reported by The Christian Science Monitor’s Olivia Lowenberg.

The growing popularity of air travel is expected to drive those numbers up. Aviation and shipping are expected to contribute 40 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, according to a study by University College London’s Energy Institute. Scientists around the world are trying to make sure that doesn’t happen.

Airbus isn't the only company exploring biofuels. In 2008, Air New Zealand conducted a test flight of a Boeing 747-400 flown on a 50-50 mixture of biofuel made from jatropha oil, derived from the plant with the same name, and traditional jet fuel, according to The New York Times.

A few months later, Japan Air conducted test flights of planes also powered by a half-and-half mixture of biofuel and kerosene jet fuel. The biofuel was made up of 84 percent camelina oil, 16 percent jatropha oil and less than 1 percent algal pond scum, the Monitor reported at the time.

Solazyme, a California biotech firm, already produces algal jet fuel, in addition to algal-based diesel fuels for cars, trucks, and navy vessels, according to Popular Science.

Algal fuel offers advantages over biofuels like ethanol. Algae can grow 12 times faster than plants grown in soil, and it produces an oil yield about 30 times that of rapeseed. But turning algae into biofuel is expensive and technically challenging.

Growing algae requires much more carbon dioxide than other plants, according to Popular Science, which recommended either growing it near high-carbon sources such as coal-fired power plants, or genetically modifying it to need less CO2.

After it has grown, converting algae to biofuel requires removing plant cellulose from the biomass, an expensive process, reported the Monitor’s Cristina Maza. To do this, plants must sit in hot acid or under steam pressure, which requires an expensive grade of stainless steel.

Researchers are working to genetically modify plants to make it easier and cheaper to remove plant cellulose, writes Ms. Maza, but this might reduce their yield and make them more susceptible to pathogens or rust.

At the same time, oil prices are low, reducing incentives to develop biofuel, which can cost up to three times more than traditional fuels, reported the Monitor’s Ms. Lowenberg.

Regardless, Airbus has high hopes for its project.

On Thursday, Iran Air got even more good news.

The European Commission announced that it will allow the airline to once again fly into European airspace.

""Following my visit to Iran in April, a technical assessment was successfully carried out in May,"" EU transport commissioner Violeta Bulc said in a statement.

""Based on this I am happy to announce that we are now also able to allow most aircraft from Iran Air back into European skies.""

Since the Revolution of 1979, the country has suffered through decades of severe economic sanctions that have had a devastating effect on the country's commercial aviation industry and its national airline.

Iran Air, once one of the region's most respected airlines, has fallen on hard times.

For much of the past 30 years, trade sanctions have prevented the airline from acquiring new planes directly from western airplane makers.

As a result, Iran Air have been forced to make do with an aging fleet of early generation Airbus aircraft and pre-revolution Boeing jumbo jets. According to Airfleets.net, Iran Air's fleet of 46 jets have an average age of 27 years with its fleet of Boeing 747s pushing 40 years of service.

And what planes they do have, the airline often struggles to find adequate spare parts to keep them running properly.

Accidents resulting for mechanical failures became increasingly common, leading the EU to ban most of Iran Air's planes in 2010.

But even with this week's announcement, the airline's Boeing 747s and Fokker 100s are still considered too unsafe to be allowed to fly over Europe.

Unfortunately for Iran Air, those two aircraft types account for nearly half of its fleet, according to Airfleets.net.

But with the country's landmark deal to curb nuclear activities in January, expect the resurgence of Iran's aviation sector increase in pace over the next few years.

With nearly 220 planes on order, Iran Air and its management are looking to return the once world-class carrier to its previous luster. At this rate, Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar Airways may have a new regional power with which to contend."

Kestrel Aviation Management

In July, China's HNA Aviation Group will welcome a shiny new Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner to its fleet.

This plane is special because it is the first 787 Dreamliner to be built purely as a private jet.

HNA's new Dreamliner is symbolic of a hot new trend in private and corporate aviation — long-range, mid-size, wide-body airliners.

""It's an emerging market that didn't really exist in the past,"" Kestrel Aviation Management CEO Stephen Vella told Business Insider. Kestrel oversaw the design, engineering, and fabrication of HNA's new Dreamliner which has an estimated total cost topping $300 million.

Airbus and Boeing have long offered versions of its airliners to private customers under their Airbus Corporate Jet and Boeing Business Jet programs. However, buyers of these airliner-based private jets have long gravitated to either four-engine, jumbo jets like the Boeing 747 or smaller, narrow-body jets such as the Airbus A320.

""The market is traditionally separated into two buckets,"" Vella said. ""The big Boeing 747s and Airbus A340s primarily catered to heads of state while the smaller Airbus A320 and Boeing 737s are popular corporate runabouts as well as secondary planes in government fleets.""

Although twin-engine, mid-size, wide-body jets such as the Boeing 767 and the Airbus A330 have long been available, they never quite caught on with the private jet crowd.

However, in recently years, ultra high-end private jet customers have become increasingly interested in the new generation mid-size, wide-body planes such as the Dreamliner and Airbus A350.

What's changed?

According to Vella, several factors led to the shift.

First, leading business men and heads of state are generally pressed for time. As a result, they prefer be to able to fly anywhere they need to go non-stop. Until recently, this simply wasn't possible in a twin-engined jet. The traditional thinking in the aviation dictates that there's safety in the number of engines a plane has.

Regulating bodies such as the US Federal Aviation Administration have even placed limits on which ultra-long-range intercontinental routes twin-engine jets can fly. As a result, government and corporate clients looking for a plane with the range and capability to go anywhere in the world had to turn to four-engined jumbos.

However, with the incredible reliability of modern turbofan engines, the regulatory limitations on twin-engined jets have essentially been wiped out. Now, planes such as the A350 and the 787 can fly anywhere the owner requires, but in a slightly smaller and more affordable package. For instance, HNA's new state-of-the-art composite Boeing has a range of 9,800 miles even when packed with passengers, luggage, and fuel. A similarly outfitted A350 ACJ will be able to delivery that type of performance as well.

Secondly, the price of crude oil has fallen dramatically over the past two years. Even though cheaper fuel makes buying and operating a thirsty, four-engined, jumbo jet much more attractive, low crude prices have also cut dramatically into the income of Middle Eastern governments. Unfortunately for the 747 BBJ, they are also some of the plane's biggest customers.

According to Vella, all major Middle Eastern governments such as Saudi Arabia, operate large royal fleets, many of which are jumbo jets, for elite members of the ruling family and officials to use.

Over the next decade or so, these fleets with need to be updated. Vella, whose company has bought and sold more than $50 billion worth of commercial and private jets, believes the Middle Eastern clientele are ready to do some belt-tightening and downsize to smaller planes.

Finally, another factor that has benefited the Dreamliner-sized jet is the increasing public sensitivity towards political largess. Unlike the US, where the plane that operates as Air Force One is held in high esteem and seen as a symbol of national power, the public in many countries view a large presidential aircraft as a sign of political over indulgence.

According to Vella, this is a particularly sensitive issue in Europe. However, a smaller aircraft with the performance capabilities of a jumbo, but in a less attention-getting package is a reasonable alternative.

""The mid-size jets have less ramp presence,"" Vella said. ""They offer the owner much more discretion.""

After all, it's hard to arrive discretely in a jumbo jet no matter where you go. Even at the world's busiest international airports, an aircraft the size of a 747 or Airbus A380 is conspicuous.

But all of this requires some perspective. Even the ""smaller"" 787 BBJ is still an absolutely massive aircraft. At 186 ft. long, even Donald Trump's converted Boeing 757 is dwarfed by the new Dreamliner. And with 2,400 sq. ft. of living space, it offers the same amount of room as an average American suburban home.

What's coming

According to the long-time aviation executive, over the next 15-20 years, demand from just the Middle East for Boeing 787-sized private jets will top 30 aircraft. That may not sound like many planes, but at more than $300 million a pop, that's about $10 billion in business from just a handful of customers.

In fact, Vella believes demand from East Asia will be just as intense over that period of time.

""Because of the high number of long distance and (trans-oceanic) flights the customers make, these are the perfect planes for Asia,"" Vella added.

Whether the market for these mid-size, twin-engine wide-body private jets actually skyrockets remain to be seen. But with the unprecedented level of advanced technology, luxury, and performance it can offer, they are an undeniably attractive option for the right buyer."

The recovery of the black boxes follows a breakthrough earlier in the week, when ships searching part of the Mediterranean north of Egypt spotted the wreckage of the plane and started mapping its debris on the seabed.

Though families of the victims are losing hope the remains of their loved ones can be recovered intact from the seabed, knowing what had caused the crash could bring closure.

""Finding answers to our many questions will give us some relief,"" said Malek Zayada, a Sudanese living in Cairo. His brother, Mohammed Saleh Zayada, a 62-year-old scholar with the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization who specialized in translation and history, was one of the passengers on the doomed flight.

It's still not known what brought the plane down between the Greek island of Crete and the Egyptian coast -- or whether the aircraft broke apart in the air, or stayed intact until it struck the water.

No militant group has said it downed the plane, which was flying to Cairo from Paris when it crashed on May 19. The wreckage was believed to be at a depth of about 9,800 feet. Previously, search crews found only small floating pieces of debris and some human remains.

On Friday, a statement from the Egyptian committee said the vessel John Lethbridge, contracted by the Egyptian government to search for the wreckage, pulled the data recorder out of the sea in stages. It added that it managed to successfully retrieve the memory unit of the recorder, which is the most important component.

While the statement didn't elaborate on the condition of the recorder, it implied that the memory unit had been safely recovered. The two so-called black boxes were tucked into the plane's tail.

The committee said later Friday that both recorders were brought to Cairo from the port city of Alexandria, where they were transferred from the site of the crash. The data will be downloaded and analyzed in the coming days.

""The analysis might take weeks,"" depending on the condition of the recorders' memory units, the committee said. If there is damage, the recorders may have to be taken outside of Egypt first to be repaired.

France's Accident Investigating Bureau aid Friday it's sending an investigator to Cairo ""to lend our technical expertise to the reading of the two recordings."" The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board had said Thursday that it was sending an investigator and a recorder specialist to Cairo. Honeywell, the U.S. technology company that manufactured the cockpit voice recorder, is providing technical support as well.

A top security official at the Cairo International Airport, Brig. Gen. Fahmi Megahed, ordered extra security measures at the civil aviation ministry headquarters and the investigation team offices, where the recorders will be analyzed. Both are adjacent to the airport.

Flight 804 disappeared from radar about 2:45 a.m. May 19 after it had entered Egyptian airspace. Radar data showed the aircraft had been cruising normally in clear skies before it turned 90 degrees left, then a full 360 degrees to the right as it plummeted from 38,000 feet to 15,000 feet. It disappeared at 10,000 feet.

Leaked flight data indicated that a sensor had detected smoke in a lavatory and a fault in two of the plane's cockpit windows in the final moments of the flight.

""The plane clearly suffered an instant severe damage that left it uncontrollable,"" said Shaker Kelada, an EgyptAir official who was not involved in the search but has led other crash investigations for the national carrier. He said finding the black boxes was ""a great success"" but that ""now time and patience is needed to analyze them.""

Egypt's civil aviation minister, Sherif Fathi, has said terrorism is a more probable cause than equipment failure or some other catastrophic event.

Finding the black boxes was essential and could reveal whether a mechanical fault, a hijacking or a bomb caused the disaster. Investigators also hope the black boxes will offer clues as to why there was no distress call.

There are two black boxes on board each plane -- a cockpit voice recorder, which should contain a record of the last 30 minutes in the cockpit, and is equipped to detect even loud breathing. The second is the flight data recorder, which would contain technical information on the engines, wings and cabin pressure.

Airbus DS GmbH/A. Ruttloff

The Sentinel-2B optical satellite is the second of its type from Airbus Defence and Space, providing the “Colour Vision” of Europe´s Earth observation programme Copernicus, a joint project of the European Commission and the European Space Agency (ESA).

In the coming months, the completed satellite will undergo a series of environmental tests at ESA’s research and technology centre ESTEC, Noordwijk (The Netherlands), to determine its readiness for flight.

The Sentinel-2 mission, designed and built by a consortium of around 60 companies led by Airbus Defence and Space, is based on a constellation of two identical satellites flying in the same orbit, 180° apart for optimal coverage and data delivery. Together they image all Earth’s land surfaces, large islands, inland and coastal waters every five days at the equator. Sentinel-2A was launched on 23 June 2015, its twin, Sentinel-2B, will follow early next year.

The Sentinel-2 satellites deliver optical images from the visible-near infrared to short-wave infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum using a total of 13 spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 10, 20 or 60 meters and a swath width of 290 km. Sentinel-2 is dedicated to monitor land use and management, soil sealing, forest and crops. It may also be used to observe natural disasters like floods, forest fires, landslides, and coastal erosion to support ground humanitarian aid.

The Sentinel-1 and -2 satellites are equipped with the Tesat-Spacecom’s laser communication terminal. The SpaceDataHighway is being implemented within a Public- Private Partnership between ESA and Airbus Defence and Space."

Airspace by Airbus - Aircraft Interiors International,"Tue, 07 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmNyYWZ0aW50ZXJpb3JzaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvYWlyc3BhY2UtYnktYWlyYnVzLTIuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The recent Aircraft Interiors Expo (held in Hamburg, Germany, on April 5-7, 2016) provided the perfect opportunity for Aircraft Interiors International to catch up with Airbus’ vice-president of cabin marketing, Ingo Wuggetzer, and take a tour of the new A330neo interior mock-up. And where better to start than at the entrance? The welcome area at Door 2 of the A330neo features a new illuminated LED panel offering up to 16.7 million possible color variations, enabling airlines to define multiple scenarios and reflect their branding. This can be combined with a Gobo projection lighting option that illuminates adjacent monuments, such as the galleys and lavatories. “The LED ceiling panel and the projection technology create a unique impression that the passenger will remember,” enthuses Wuggetzer.

Airbus has also paid a lot of attention to defining the cabin architecture so as to create a more airy and spacious entrance. “Take the cabin lining around the door: this used to include a pelmet, but we have completely removed it so we now just have the curve of the ceiling panel running right up to the door,” says Wuggetzer. “So when you board, the space opens up right away, giving each passenger a clear view of the new welcome area and lighting feature. It’s just a little thing that we changed but it gives a much broader impression when first boarding, providing a better welcome, because the space opens up much more efficiently.”

Good hygiene

Once I had finished marveling at the light show and flat, bin-free ceiling above the entrance, my next stop was the new, improved lavatory, which will be available in a range of wheelchair-accessible configurations to suit individual airline requirements. A combination of new LED lighting and a softer and more rounded trim and finish design creates a spacious and contemporary feel. The introduction of an antibacterial coating to certain surfaces in the lavatory is highlighted in the mock-up by some rather intrusive stickers – a necessary evil in a bid to soothe passengers worried about health and hygiene on board. Other options included with hygiene in mind include touchless flushing and taps, while discreet aroma dispensers and soothing, ambient sounds are included to further de-stress travelers.

“Regarding hygiene, it’s actually more of a perception problem than a reality,” says Wuggetzer. “Hence we have applied an antibacterial coating, but we had to make it visible by way of a design element that indicates anything painted in that color is antibacterial. This is something our designers are working on, to decide how to communicate this message easily. We’ve also really tried to work on the passengers’ senses by adding sound and mood lighting to the lavatories.”

Bags more storage

Another big visual change from the classic A330 is a new outer/lateral overhead bin design that provides a 66% increase in capacity, allowing five cases to be placed in each four-frame bin. It’s not just passengers who will benefit: the bigger bins should reduce boarding time and crew workload as more passengers should be able to stow their luggage above their own seats.

The bin doors have also undergone a makeover – with new latches and integrated LED hand/grip rail lighting to match those first introduced on the A350 XWB. Wuggetzer admits creating flowing lines with glowing hand rails is an important design trick: “It gives you a perception of spaciousness; straight and parallel lines together will also always give you an impression of a quality product. You have the same thing in the automotive industry with cars that use parallel lines as a quality feature indicator to underline the precise quality of their manufacture. This is something we believe we can deliver, too.”

Just like the A350 XWB, the A330neo will feature fourth-generation IFE, with HD screens and discrete electronic boxes to ensure the footwell under each seat remains uncluttered, enabling passengers to stretch their legs. Meanwhile, items including magazine racks, ventilation grilles and window bezels have been upgraded and restyled to reduce cabin noise and increase the sense of space.

Brand designs

The windows are engraved with an Airspace by Airbus logo – a little detail that provides a big clue as to the importance Airbus attaches to its new cabin brand. “It’s a very subtle application of the brand name in the product itself,” explains Wuggetzer, who despite wanting to ensure the cabin remains a flexible canvas onto which an airline can project their own brand, also believes there is room for a much stronger OEM identity within the cabin.

“We want to help the airlines to tell their passengers about the DNA benefits of an Airbus aircraft – the quietest cabin in the sky and the 18in-wide seats in a 2-4-2 economy configuration,” he says. “This will always be the case, no matter what brand you apply or what seat manufacturer you select as an airline. We want to have Airbus features that create a clear differentiation for the passenger and this is something we want to promote and something the airline will want to promote directly to passengers as well.”

Room with a view

Unlike Boeing with its 787, Airbus has eschewed electrochromatic window shades in favor of simple, manually operated shades in the main cabin. “Our solution is quite a practical one; just a plastic shade, but it works and it’s completely dark,” says Wuggetzer. “We did discuss the same technology with our customers, but it turns out this was one of their lowest priorities that they were really ready to pay for and wanted on board their aircraft.”

Greater overall passenger seat pitch has been achieved, as well as greater recline for the seats in front of the ‘smart’ lavatory monument, although airlines may decide to install up to 10 extra seats instead, at the same comfort standard as before. “Our efficiency enablers allow more seats to be accommodated without compromising passenger’s space and comfort,” says Wuggetzer. “Moreover, compared with today’s A330 layouts, if the same number of seats are used in combination with the efficiency enablers, then an increased seat pitch can be realized on the greater usable floor space.”

Finally, the flight crew rest has been relocated to the lower deck to free up space on the main deck for additional passengers. It can accommodate two separate bunks for pilots and six bunks for cabin crew, and comes complete with new padding and mattress materials, enhanced lighting and an improved heating system.

White lines

Despite some clear similarities to the A350 cabin, Wuggetzer is wary of direct comparisons: “Yes the design language we developed was inspired by the A350, but we have had to apply it to a different cross-section and introduce some very different elements,” he says. “It’s very much a new cabin and certainly not a copy and paste job. However, the design language or DNA for both aircraft can be defined in terms of straight lines, very clean surfaces and soft shapes.”

One feature that Wuggetzer is particularly fond of is the color of the components that make up the majority of the cabin lining and interior surfaces. A fresh, clean, almost dazzling white adds a strong sense of modernity, banishing the more familiar vanilla to the history books. “We wanted a color that gives a contemporary design because it will help the cabin age better; the basic elements of the architecture that we deliver need to look modern and fresh for the next 20 years,” he says. “We wanted one standard color that, in combination with the mood lighting, will help to create that perfect color that matches your brand.”

Of course no color or finish worth its salt can go without its own name these days – and this particular shade has been christened Jana White. “I’m not sure if I should tell you this story, but it came from the name of the daughter of the designer who created it,” reveals Wuggetzer. “What can I say, we like to keep things in the family.”

Supply and demand

So who will be supplying key A330neo interior components? “At this stage we can’t disclose a precise breakdown of our suppliers, which are being carefully selected according to their engineering and industrial competence,” says Wuggetzer, although he admits “all the big interiors suppliers are in contention”. These big suppliers are thought to include both Zodiac and B/E Aerospace, and it is likely the program will feature a dual-source supply strategy, although Wuggetzer was not able to confirm precise details. “As a matter of course we build-in contingency in our development planning,” he says. “Some components are in double sourcing and we manage this aspect carefully; however, we can’t disclose a precise breakdown.”

Overall, Wuggetzer can’t hide his paternal affection for the new design upon seeing it realized in the flesh for the first time by way of the mock-up: “I’m really impressed – it looks even better than the renderings and the movie because it really conveys that sense of extra space.”

Airbus Group focuses on ‘making it fly’ - Skies Magazine,"Thu, 02 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZXNtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWdyb3VwLWZvY3VzZXMtb24tbWFraW5nLWl0LWZseS_SAURodHRwczovL3NraWVzbWFnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1ncm91cC1mb2N1c2VzLW9uLW1ha2luZy1pdC1mbHkvP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After collectively rebranding itself as Airbus Group in 2014, the European original equipment manufacturer (OEM) is now focused on developing international strategy across three divisions: Airbus Commercial, Airbus Helicopters, and Airbus Defence and Space.

Donough Tierney, Airbus Group’s vice president Europe and Canada, UN and multinational organizations, told Skies during the 2016 CANSEC defence show in Ottawa that the impact of Airbus Group in Canada cannot be underestimated.

“It’s a bit of a secret that we are so embedded in this country,” said Tierney. “We went under several names; now it’s all Airbus Group. We’ve never been at a point like this before, where we’ve achieved a new sourcing record in Canada, sourcing $1.2 billion from a total of 570 suppliers. Over 17,000 jobs are sustained in the national aerospace market through our sourcing activities.”

Globally, Airbus Group enjoyed a successful year in 2015, with its total order book value surpassing US$1 trillion. The work translates into 10 years of future factory output, driven mainly by commercial aerospace. Tierney said the civilian sector accounts for about 75 per cent of the group’s revenues, with the remainder attributed to defence.

With about 140,000 employees worldwide—2,000 of them in Canada—Airbus Group brought in revenues of 64 billion euros company-wide last year.

Tierney said Airbus has about 150 aircraft flying in Canada for various airlines, and has sold close to 700 helicopters nation-wide. “Over the last 15 years, every second helicopter delivered in Canada has been one of ours,” he said. “Recently, the oil and gas and mining sectors have been a bit soft, however. I would say it’s business as usual [for the helicopter division] in Canada, but times have been better.”

He added that Airbus Helicopters in Fort Erie, Ont., is a company success story. Established in 1984 as an initial sales and support organization, the factory has become a composites manufacturing and export centre of excellence, bidding for and winning several internal work packages.

Similarly, Montreal-based Stelia Aerospace has grown to be the fourth-largest global supplier of aerostructures and interior aerospace parts. Tierney said Stelia’s history—an amalgamation of several smaller organizations—reflects the restructuring that is currently taking place among Tier 1 aerospace suppliers. “They are growing and investing money, taking risks, and getting bigger payoffs,” he said. “We will probably see Tier 2 and 3 restructuring as well.”

Strategic vision

Tierney said Airbus Group has recently honed its focus.

“A few years ago, we were involved in lots of different things,” he explained. “As a group today, we organized ourselves around aviation. We decided our strategic direction would be around ‘making it fly.’ So we’re looking at those areas of business we need to invest in to grow the aeronautics side of the business.”

A perfect example is the March 2016 acquisition of Waterloo, Ont.-based Navtech, a provider of specialized navigation tools and software. “This fits in with our strategy to provide digital products and services to the aerospace industry,” said Tierney.

He said Airbus Group is focusing on providing products that will deliver incremental innovation in aircraft performance—sharklet specialized wingtips, for example, which improve payload and range performance of commercial passenger jets.

“We’re also looking at disruptive innovation. We have set up a Silicon Valley operation to find the future of flight—in other words, what’s next? We also have a new UAS [unmanned aircraft systems] strategy coming out for the Group. We’ve been invested in drones for the last 10 or 15 years and have different platforms now, but exactly where we’re going to go will be announced in the next few months,” continued Tierney.

Airbus Group is also looking at ways to reorganize and improve the supply chain.

Tierney said the OEM is still focused on landing a “major contract success” in Canada, noting that would perhaps come with the selection of the country’s new fixed-wing search and rescue aircraft. Airbus Defence and Space has put forward its C295 as a contender for that program, with a decision expected this fall."
Roketsan To Equip Airbus Helicopters With CIRIT Missile System - Defense News,"Thu, 16 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE2LzA2LzE2L3Jva2V0c2FuLXRvLWVxdWlwLWFpcmJ1cy1oZWxpY29wdGVycy13aXRoLWNpcml0LW1pc3NpbGUtc3lzdGVtL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey's state-controlled missile maker, Roketsan, has signed a deal to equip Airbus Helicopters' H135M and H145M platforms with its laser-guided missile system, the CIRIT, the company announced.

The H135M and H145M are Airbus' lightweight, armed combat helicopter platforms. The CIRIT is a 77mm guided-missile system. It has a range of 8 kilometers.

""We present to our customers [an] extremely versatile platform with highly effective weapons for armed scout operations. What we believe is that this program will lead to a long-term cooperation between our companies to extend our solutions to allied countries['] armed forces,"" said Emin Alpman, Roketsan's chairman, according to a company news release.

Olivier Michalon, Airbus Helicopters' senior vice president and head of Europe, said: ""Airbus Helicopters is proud to reinforce its industrial cooperation with Roketsan. We are optimistic about the genuine interest such [a] solution based on the H135M and H145M could raise both in Turkey and in the international market.""

The CIRIT is becoming Roketsan's signature export system. In early 2014, Roketsan won a $196.2 million contract from the United Arab Emirates for the CIRIT system. The Turkish army has chosen the CIRIT system to equip its T129, AH-1P Cobra and AH-1W Super Cobra attack helicopters, citing low-cost precision-strike capabilities of the system.

Last year, Roketsan also signed a deal with the Polish company WZL1 to make its debut in the country. Roketsan said the deal with WZL1 aims to have the CIRIT, along with another system, the UMTAS, to be integrated into platforms in the inventory of the Polish Armed Forces.

According to Sami Atalan, a defense expert and editor at C4Defense, ""the latest deal with Airbus [Helicopters] illustrates the competitiveness of the system and may prompt further export contracts.""

John Leahy, COO-Customers for Airbus, last week poked Bombardier for its order from Delta Air Lines. Citing a reported airplane sales price of $22m, which Leahy estimated cost BBD $7m per airplane, Airbus’ chief salesman—known for his barbs and quips—said if BBD sold more C Series faster, the company would go out of business quicker.

Set aside for the moment the numbers he cited as unknown quantities. LNC has different figures we’ve reported and in two posts on my column at Forbes, here and here, there are other aspects to the Delta deal that affect economics.

It’s undisputed that BBD took a US$500m charge against the Delta, Air Canada and AirBaltic deals. The second Forbes post explains why. It’s all about the learning curve. Airbus and Boeing know about this: the first A350s are being chalked up to big losses and the 787 has $29bn in production costs. But it’s not to their benefit to acknowledge this when criticizing the C Series deals.

All this is neither here nor there, however. Airbus, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas all have (had) done deals that don’t seem to make commercial sense when key, strategic transactions were necessary.

Airbus and Eastern Airlines

Airbus was a new entrant into commercial aviation in 1974 with the A300B2/B4 series, a 250 passenger, twin-aisle, twin-engine aircraft. It was the first of its kind, from

a new company that Boeing, Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas didn’t initially take seriously.

Neither did the rest of the world. Government-controlled Airbus won orders from the government-controlled Air France and Lufthansa Airlines. But sales of the A300 were few and far between otherwise, with long, long dry spells.

Eastern Airlines in the USA was flirting with bankruptcy, at a time when airline bankruptcies were unheard of. It had an ancient fleet but no money to buy new airplanes. Airbus North America came up with an idea to loan, as in free of charge, four A300B4s to Eastern for a six-month test drive, so-to-speak. If Eastern didn’t like the airplanes, it could return them. If it did, an order was expected.

EAL liked the aircraft and ordered them. Airbus and engine supplier financed the airplanes. The A300s remained with Eastern, and later its sister company, Continental Airlines, for years to come.

This was Airbus’ first entry into the United States.

McDonnell Douglas and American Airlines

McDonnell Douglas had serious difficulties in selling its new DC-9 Super 80 (this was before the MD-80 marketing name was adopted) in the early 1980s. Sales were

so anemic that there was a lot of speculation that the program was doomed to failure.

To kick-start sales and obtain a brand name endorsement, MDC struck a deal with American Airlines for 20 of the aircraft on a five year walk-away. If American didn’t like the airplanes, the carrier could return them to MDC after five years, no questions asked.

The risk to MDC was great at the time. But it paid off. American did like them and ultimately ordered more than 250. Only now is the airline finally retiring this fleet.

Airbus, Boeing and American Airlines

In the 1980s, American wanted a twin-aisle, twin-engine aircraft for its growing business across the Atlantic and into the Caribbean. Airbus and Boeing squared off with the A300-600R and 767. It was assumed only one would come away the winner.

In fact, American struck deals with both companies. Once again, AA used the walk-away feature as part of the contracts with both companies. American never did exercise the feature and ultimately Boeing won far more orders than Airbus, but the latter did sell 35 A300s to American—a good number at the time.

Airbus and Delta Air Lines

When Pan Am, a major Airbus customer, was on its death spiral, Delta purchased PA’s New York and Frankfurt hubs. Some Airbus A310-200s/300s came with the transaction. These were the first Airbus’ in Delta’s fleet, which at the time operated only Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft.

Jim Bryan, then president of Airbus North America, told his chief salesman, John Leahy, to sell new A310-300s to Delta. Once again, the deal contained the walk-away feature.

Leahy sold nine aircraft to Delta. Only this time, the outcome wasn’t what Airbus hoped.

The era was the early 1990s. Iraq invaded Kuwait and the US and its allies came to Kuwait’s defense. Oil prices spiked. None of the world’s airlines was prepared and bankruptcies—especially in the US—became common.

Delta was threatened with bankruptcy and took drastic actions to avoid it. The CEO at the time, Ron Allen, launched a program called Leadership 7.5, a reference to a goal of reducing seat mile costs to 7.5 cents per available seat mile. Drastic cost cutting ensued. Included was a fleet rationalization. The result: all the Pan Am A310s, plus the nine recently delivered new ones from Airbus, were removed from the fleet.

Boeing and SAS

McDonnell Douglas’ commercial aircraft division was hanging on by its flaps. The MD-11 wasn’t selling, the MD-80 and its successor, the MD-90, were struggling and its new MD-95 was in its infancy. MDC’s commercial market share was down to about 7%.

MDC needed a brand name launch customer for the MD-95. It turned to SAS, which had ordered every Douglas aircraft since the DC-3 (except for the DC-5). A deal was struck, but not yet under contract, when Boeing swooped in with a sweetheart offer for the 737-600. The price was never disclosed and my memory of the market intelligence on this had long since faded. What I do remember is that the word on the street was the price was a loss-leader for Boeing, which subsequently sold a large number of 737NGs to SAS.

The Bottom Line

I could go on and on, of course. But you get the picture. There are times when The Bottom Line is about more than just The Bottom Line. Bombardier’s deal with Delta may have been one of them.

Boeing won an $11.3bn order for 100 737 MAX 200 airplanes from Vietnam’s low-cost airline VietJet Aviation Joint Stock Company (VietJet).

Vietjet aims to expand its domestic and international networks with the newly ordered airplanes, which will be delivered from 2019 through 2023.

With the order, Vietjet also plans to increase its fleet to more than 200 airplanes by the end of 2023.

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is preparing to launch the Reusable Launch Vehicle – Technology Demonstrator (RLV-TD) space shuttle, which has been developed by the country’s own indigenous efforts.

As part of its initiative, ISRO scientists are developing a winged body design prototype that is about the weight and size of a sports utility vehicle (SUV).

However, while some countries are abandoning the idea of using a winged reusable launch vehicle, ISRO considers it as a way to reduce satellite launching expenses.

Global specialist banking and asset management group Investec Bank raised $1bn to finance leases for UAE-based Emirates Airlines’ four Airbus A380-800 aircraft.

Raised by the aviation finance arm of Investec, the fund facilitated the delivery and sale and leaseback of four A380-800s, which include 2013 and 2016 models.

Investec acquired the 2013 aircraft from Aviation Finance Company (AFC) holding company Stellwagen Finance, which is involved in making investments in aviation businesses, financing new aircraft and create transportation infrastructure.

Nasa launched a super-pressure balloon (SPB) from New Zealand’s Wanaka Airport, in order to test and validate SPB technology with the aim of achieving long-duration flight of more than 100 days at mid-latitudes.

During its around-the-world test flight, the gondola is carrying a Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) gamma-ray telescope as a mission of opportunity.

The Nasa-funded COSI mission is developed by the University of California, Berkeley, US, and designed to probe origins of galactic positrons, study the creation of new elements in the galaxy as well as perform studies of gamma-ray bursts and black holes.

US-based Alaska Airlines received certification from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for an improved full-stall model in a flight simulator, which helps pilots train to recognise and recover from a full aerodynamic stall.

Though this type of mid-air stall is very rare, simulator training helps pilots prepare for worst-case scenarios.

With the latest FAA certification, the Alaska Air Group subsidiary is claimed to be the first commercial airline in the world to receive certification for such simulator.

Global aircraft components maker TransDigm Group entered into a definitive agreement to buy Data Device (DDC) parent company ILC Holdings, for $1bn in cash.

Airbus Helicopters earlier this year passed an important milestone in the development of the high-speed, compound helicopter demonstrator currently being built as part of the Clean Sky 2 European research program. A mockup of the breakthrough airframe design has just undergone wind tunnel testing in an Airbus facility.

The tests proved the viability of the chosen design in terms of efficiency, sustainability and performance, paving the way for a preliminary design review expected end of 2016. Meanwhile, the overall project has passed its first official milestone involving all core partners by reaching the end of its pre-design phase.

Building upon the achievements of the company-funded and record-breaking X3 technology demonstrator, the Airbus Helicopters Clean Sky demonstrator will help refine the “compound” aerodynamic configuration and bring it closer to an operational design, with the end objective of meeting future requirements for increased speed, better cost-efficiency, as well dramatic reductions of emission and acoustic footprints. Flight-testing of the prototype is expected to start in 2019.

“We are honored to be carrying out this project on behalf of the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking and the large number of European companies who are taking part in the development. Our ambition is to become the benchmark of the rotorcraft industry, and as such we are willing to drive a bold vision for the future of helicopter transportation,” said Jean-Brice Dumont, Airbus Helicopters chief technical officer. “Our Clean Sky 2-demonstrator will not only be about going faster; it will help make speed smarter by seeking the best trade-off between cost-efficiency, sustainability and mission performance.

“We want to break the cost barrier usually associated with increased speed and range and pave the way for new mission sets for 2030 and beyond, by providing crucial emergency or door-to-door transportation services to European citizens where they need it most.”

Development of the Clean Sky 2-demonstrator relies on a wide European network of industrial partners who are bringing their technical skills and know-how to the project. While Airbus Helicopters facilities in France, Germany, Spain and Poland are involved in areas such as structural and mechanical design, other countries like Romania, Italy and the United Kingdom also highly contribute their expertise through a large number of design and manufacturing work packages.

“The LifeRCraft Demonstrator project in Clean Sky 2 will pull together capabilities from across the European research area, addressing technology gaps in systems, structures and overall design and demonstrating the viability of a compound rotorcraft design that can bring a fundamentally new combination of payload/range/speed to the aviation market,” said Ron Van Manen, Clean Sky 2 program manager. “In particular where a rapid response or a key range requirement exists (such as in disaster relief, medical evacuation or search-and-rescue) this aircraft concept can bring important benefits to the public and open new market opportunities that will strengthen Europe’s already formidable competitive position in the vertical lift aviation sector.”"

Britain Mulls Replacement Space Program to Airbus' Skynet 5 - Defense News,"Thu, 02 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXIvMjAxNi8wNi8wMi9icml0YWluLW11bGxzLXJlcGxhY2VtZW50LXNwYWNlLXByb2dyYW0tdG8tYWlyYnVzLXNreW5ldC01L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON — Britain is expected in the next few weeks to take the first formal step toward building a new generation of space-based tactical communications for its armed forces. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) is considering whether to approve the assessment phase of the Future Beyond Line of Sight (FBLOS) program to replace its current Skynet 5 system.

If the program's assessment phase is approved, the outcome could herald big changes to how Britain meets future demands for satellite and possibly near-space tactical communications systems.

The procurement arm of the MoD, the Defence Equipment and Support organization, is scheduled to submit a business case to MoD and Treasury officials later this month.

Included in the scheme are a possible early purchase of up to two satellites to bridge the gap between Skynet 5 and the use of any new capabilities that may come to fruition over the next decade.

During the assessment phase, the MoD will look at a range of technologies and service provision options, consider the benefits of greater international cooperation, and seek a balance between the use of civil and military satellite services by its military.

Industry executives here said one of the unintended consequences of a 20-year deal with Airbus is the MoD is now short on expertise and resources in the sector, and it's likely the ministry will appoint a contractor to help set requirements and undertake other tasks.

The MoD itself was reluctant to say much ahead of the business case submission.

""We continue to consider a range of options for the FBLOS project and aim to submit the initial business case this summer "" was all an MoD spokeswoman would say on the subject.

The MoD will use the assessment to nail down how it intends to provide the communications service after the present deal with Airbus Defence and Space comes to an end in 2022.

Airbus was awarded a single, long-term contract in 2003 to supply and operate satellite, ground terminals and control rooms as a private finance initiative (PFI).

Now, the British look as though they will break up FBLOS into several separate competitions rather than award a single deal to one contractor.

PFIs have fallen out of favor with the Conservative government; while nothing can be ruled out, the MoD is saying it won't consider another PFI and it won't extend the Airbus deal.

Airbus, Boeing, Inmarsat, Lockheed Martin, Thales Alenia Space and Serco are among a host of the world's leading satellite builders and service providers likely to be interested in meeting all, or part, of the upcoming requirement.

While there has been disquiet over some PFIs, the satellite communications (satcom) scheme has served the British military well during wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Despite some recent remarks from senior officers that the current arrangement is ""suboptimal"" for commercial and technical reasons, investigations by the National Audit Office — the government's spending watchdog — concluded the scheme provided value for money.

The arrangement with Europe's leading space company is set to conclude in August 2022 when, in exchange for £1, the contractor hands over to the MoD four Airbus-built Skynet 5 spacecraft along with ground terminal and control room hardware.

Airbus also will relinquish the service and support element of the deal, some of which is subcontracted out to Serco, after what will be a 20-year run providing British satcom capabilities.

The upcoming assessment, if approved, will consider how that service element should be replaced post 2022 and, by the back end of the 2020s, how Britain should satisfy fast-growing bandwidth requirements as its unmanned air vehicle fleets multiply, special forces operations increase and the Royal Navy's new F-35-equipped aircraft carriers become fully operational.

Shorter-term satellite capability issues are being addressing as well.

The likely launch of at least one gap-filler satellite is being looked at to guarantee capability requirements as some of the older spacecraft in Skynet 5 approach the end of their useful lives.

Competition for a new satellite likely will spark a fierce debate around sovereignty and the protection of local satellite industry capabilities as Airbus, the only significant satellite builder here, seeks to fend off US rivals and others from gaining a foothold.

The company is already warning that a deal awarded to foreign rivals could see Britain lose its spacecraft-building capabilities.

""Airbus has the No. 1 space capability in the UK, although others may promise to create capability here,"" said Richard Franklin, the head of secure communications at Airbus's UK arm. ""If you want to create and maintain sovereignty for military satcom, you need an industry that is committed. We are still here having built military satellites 10-15 years ago. If someone comes to build just one or two next-generation satellites and does not have a continuing commercial exploitation of that market afterwards and therefore have that capability [available] for the next round of procurement, there would be a real risk the UK could lose its next-generation capability,""

Boeing and Lockheed Martin are both seeking to build UK space-based businesses , according to some executives based in Britain.

""In 2014, Lockheed Martin announced the opening of a space technology office in Harwell, Oxfordshire and we continue to work closely with the UK MoD to understand more about their requirements for future military communication satellites,"" a Lockheed Martin spokeswoman said.

In a statement, Boeing said it was able to provide a multitude of military satcom capabilities to meet customer needs: ""Our heritage with US Wideband Global (WGS) system, hosted payloads, ground segments, and commercial systems gives us a wide scope of experience from which to draw upon.""

Some executives here agree that whoever builds the satellites, a gap filler is a smart move as it should give a breathing space to study whether potential technology breakthroughs could be part of FBLOS.

""The purpose of the gap-filler satellites is to preserve options for the future. The MoD view is they will not be able to take advantage of anything radical with the current project timelines. Approval of a gap filler allows them to study whether they should put things like [the solar-powered, high-altitude UAV] Zepyhr inside the requirement. They want to preserve every opportunity for being innovative,"" said Andrew Stanniland, the vice president of market development at satellite communications service provider Inmarsat Global Government.

Solar-powered UAVs operating on the edge of space, networks in the sky, constellations of cheap, low-orbit satellites and data transmission by laser rather than radio waves are some of the advances which could mature in the next decade.

The British have already purchased two Zephyr 8 UAVs from Airbus. A first flight is planned for 2017.

One of the roles to be explored is as a communications link, possibly for special forces.

Aside from the technology, the MoD will be using the assessment phase to look at how the procurement will work in the wake of the expected break up of the current Airbus-run scheme.

It's possible there will be separate competitions for the spacecraft, ground terminals and control rooms as well as finding a service provider to run the operational system. And, it could be split even further.

""They will almost certainly disassociate procurement of the big ticket capital expenditure items from the service provision. That may just be the satellites, but it could include the ground stations and perhaps the remote terminals. That is still to be determined, but they seem ready to buy the satellites and then give them to a third party service provider,"" Stanniland said.

""A year ago I would have said they will smash it into as many as 10 parcels, now I don't think that will happen, it will probably be less than a handful,"" he said. ""As they look at their own capabilities and those of industry, they may come to a compromise on how many they can compete and manage.""

With growing demand and the increasing complexity of capability and operations, Airbus is urging the MoD not to relinquish the expertise built up as a result of its Skynet 5 experience.

""We think the broad range of capability Airbus brings to Skynet 5 is unique, and we are not convinced that the complexity of the fully integrated end-to-end service is fully understood by all stakeholders yet. It's key for us as part of the assessment phase to help the customer understand that,"" Franklin said.

Executives here say Airbus' position as the incumbent end-to-end satellite provider for 20 years could provide a barrier to entry as the service supplier.

""A lot depends on what the MoD wants to do. If it's to continue in a similar vein to what they are doing now, why risk a change? But, if they want to do something different, then Airbus' advantage diminishes,"" one executive said.

Aerospace manufacturer Airbus now offers airlines the option to introduce a fifth seat to the middle aisle of the economy cabin of the A380.

The configuration change on the A380 will allow every row to seat 11 people, increasing the capacity of the economy cabin by 23.

In addition, Airbus plans to introduce a stair galley at the rear of the plane along with changes to the layout of the premium economy and business class cabins.

In total, Airbus said the proposed changes would allow the plane to carry 70 additional passengers.

Currently, the A380 can carry 544 passengers in a four-class-option and up to 853 in a single-class configuration.

Airbus has said the new layout could provide airlines with an additional £16 million in revenue each year.

In 2015, Emirates was able to fit 615 passengers onto one of its superjumbo A380s by doing away with all first-class seats making it the world's largest passenger plane.

The aircraft manufacturer said the additional seat does not require a reduction in seat width, something Airbus has said they would not reduce below 18 inches.

Well, I promised this in a previous post... be here we are. Last week in Dublin, I brought another box of Kinder Surprise Airbus A330-300s.



The surprise was they were €9.99… and not €4.90. Someone had kindly put the sign in the wrong place. Nice work Dublin Airport Duty Free.



Except they’re the same as what I have… so therefore I’m giving these away.

So, to be in with a chance to win a boxed set of Kinder Surprise with Airbus A330-300s insides (not actual Airbus A330-300s… they wouldn’t fit in a box, and the shipping fee would be horrendous) tell me…

WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE AVIATION GEEK FIND?

The weirder the find or keepsies, the better. However, as usual – I’ll use Random.org to determine the winner.

IMPORTANT NOTE: As you might had read in the previous post, The US Food and Drugs Administration takes a very dim view of Kinder Surprise Eggs – as does US Customs. Therefore this draw is NOT open to the anyone residing in the United States of America and its dependencies. The Rest of the World can take part.

(It was pointed out to me that I could shuck the chocolate, and send off the plane capsules (bypassing the FDA) – but that defeats the point of a Kinder Surprise to me. I might run another draw if I get time and a chance to pick up more Kinder Surprises with planes in them)

Turkey Just Sank An Entire Airbus Jet To Attract Tourists - TIME,"Mon, 06 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vdGltZS5jb20vNDM1ODIxNy90dXJrZXktYWlyYnVzLWRpdmluZy10b3VyaXNtL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Turkey has sunk small planes off its coast to create artificial reefs before, but on Saturday it went big — A300 Airbus jet big — in its latest move to generate diving tourism.

Authorities sunk the 177-foot-long plane into water near the Kuşadası resort in Aydin province to nestle the jet roughly 75 feet under the ocean’s surface, where sea plants and wildlife will start to populate the plane. The local government bought the plane for 270,000 lira (almost $100,000) for the express purpose of sinking it, reports Agence France-Presse.

“Our goal is to make Kuşadası a centre of diving tourism. Our goal is to protect the underwater life. And with these goals in mind, we have witnessed one of the biggest wrecks in the world.” said Aydin’s mayor, Özlem Çerçioğlu.

The airbus “wreck” is considered to be the largest plane sunk voluntarily to become an artificial reef. It took over two hours to sink, and hundreds cheered during the event as they watched from nearby boats.

Turkey’s tourism industry has struggled recently, especially after recent attacks in the country.

The C295 Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) aircraft is based on the C295 versatile tactical transport aircraft produced by Airbus Defence and Space.

The first C295 AEW&C prototype successfully made its first flight in June 2011. Airbus Military and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) in the same month that year to jointly develop and market the aircraft.

The Vietnamese Air Force is anticipated to be the launch customer for the C295 AEW&C aircraft in 2016.

C295 AEW&C design and features

The aircraft incorporates a strong airframe integrating generic systems with fewer components, ensuring low maintenance and operating costs. The fully-integrated tactical system (FITS) aboard the aircraft allows for the integration of onboard sensors.

The C295 variants are currently being offered with standard winglets to deliver high efficiency in hot and high conditions.

The C295 AEW&C has a length of 24.4m, wingspan of 25.8m and maximum take-off weight of 23,200kg.

Cockpit and avionics

The glass cockpit incorporates four large active matrix liquid crystal displays (LCDs). The advanced digital avionics system with multi-functional displays is fully compatible with night vision goggles. The avionics suite offers enhanced situational awareness and flight safety while reducing the workload of pilots.

The highly-integrated avionics system of the C295 AEW&C is based on the Thales TopDeck avionics suite. The open architecture allows for the use of civil or military equipment for multiple missions and supports the integration of future equipment.

The autopilot and flight director system comply with FAR-25 requirements for instrument landing system (ILS) Cat I and Cat II approaches and GPS non-precision approaches for automatic or manual missions.

Sensors/radars

The fourth-generation active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar from IAI/ELTA is the primary sensor of the aircraft. The AESA radar is integrated with identification friend-or-foe (IFF) system and is carried by a fast-rotating rotodome mounted on top of the fuselage.

The aircraft offers 360º surveillance for developing a real-time aerial and marine situation picture and electronic order of battle (EOB). It detects far-off air targets and low-flying aircraft involved in illegal activities. The real-time information can be shared with coalition forces through network-centric data links. Four workstations along with a dedicated rest area aboard the aircraft support lengthy missions.

""The Vietnamese Air Force is anticipated to be the launch customer for the C295 AEW&C aircraft in 2016.""

The AEW&C aircraft is also installed with self-protection equipment including radar and laser warning receivers, missile approach warning system, and chaff/flares launchers.

Engines and landing gear

The C295 AEW&C aircraft is equipped with two Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127G turboprop engines. One of the engines is installed with a propeller brake to halt the propeller when the aircraft is on ground. The engine gas generator operates in APU mode to supply electrical power and bleed air for the aircraft systems. The propeller brake system functions as a conventional onboard APU, providing cost and weight savings.

The strong retractable landing gear fitted to the aircraft allows operations in the most austere locations with the toughest conditions for take-off and landings.

The aircraft has short take-off and landing (STOL) capability, and can operate from short (no longer than 670m), soft and rough unprepared airstrips.

Performance

The aircraft can fly at a maximum cruise speed of 260k and cruise at altitudes up to 25,000ft. The low-level flight characteristics allow flight at speeds down to 110k.

The C295 offers superior manoeuvrability, hot and high performance, and low fuel consumption. It provides a very long airborne endurance of up to 11 hours."
The A330 MRTT: The Flagship of a 21st Century Approach for Airbus Defence and Space - Second Line of Defense - Second Line of Defense,"Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vc2xkaW5mby5jb20vMjAxNi8wNi90aGUtYTMzMC1tcnR0LXRoZS1mbGFnc2hpcC1vZi1hLTIxc3QtY2VudHVyeS1hcHByb2FjaC1mb3ItYWlyYnVzLWRlZmVuY2UtYW5kLXNwYWNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"2016-06-26 Second Line of Defense attended the Airbus Defence and Space Trade Media Brief held in Munich Germany on June 20 and 21st 2016.

We will be reporting on a number of the presentations and the launch discussion of the new H Force weapons system by Airbus Helicopters.

In this first piece, we will focus upon the presentation by Jerónimo Amador, the head of marketing for the A330 MRTT and other Airbus derivatives.

The first day started with the head of Airbus Defence and Space, Dirk Hoke, greeting the journalists attending the two event. The CEO told the gathering that the new strategy of the sector would be announced in the Fall and launched then. But clearly, the presentations, which followed, highlighted elements of that strategy and foreshadowed the way ahead.

Probably, no two presentations highlighted this more than the one on the tanker or from a group perspective the H force weapons presentations and demonstration on day two. They did so in a core way: these are very flexible, modular, and upgradeable systems, with software upgradeability playing a key role.

The tanker is in the hands of several operational air forces, and as such is becoming an established global fleet.

The user groups are key drivers for further change in the program, and the correlation with the A330 means that innovations driven from the commercial sector can be applied as well to the military derivative, the A330 tanker.

The global nature of the fleet and its operations means that shared experiences are being generated and shared by the users.

The certification leader – the Royal Australian Air Force – in facts has de facto certified a number of aircraft for other users.

The brief by Amador was different from past presentations to the media at the annual Trade Media Briefing (this was the 7th) in that is was really not a company business development presentation but an overview on the operational experience of the Air Forces using the aircraft and its implications for the further development of the aircraft.

In other words, rather than comparing the aircraft to others in the marketplace, it was an overview on the operational experience of the global fleet, which is a measure of the progress of the program itself.

Currently, there are 27 A330MRTT in services with more than 85,000 flight hours, which include 40,000 in the past year.

The Aussie experience was highlighted in which one RAAF tanker has been deployed to the Middle East since September 2014 with 631 sorties flown which is a monthly average of 30 plus and more than 5000 flight hours with a monthly average of 250.

Saudi Arabia has recently completed a flight test campaign to certify their AWACs as well as their legacy tanker, the KE-3.

Amador then focused on the further evolution of the tanker or what he called it as “more than a tanker.”

Progress is occurring on the automatic refueling system, the addition of wideband sitcom, avionics upgrades and enhance self-protection options.

He highlighted that the user groups were key shapers of the way ahead in terms of demand and shared experiences.

He then focused on how the evolution of the A330 itself was shaping new performance capabilities for the tanker variant, notably in terms of structural modifications, aerodynamic improvements with reduced fuel consumption and avionics computer evolutions.

In short, the Airbus tanker is part of the US and allied operational force and as the Marines told the Aussies in the Middle East, it is the tanker of choice.

In our interview with the KC-30A crew then at Edwards for certification tests earlier this year, they highlighted the evolution of the aircraft and its operational experiences.

https://sldinfo.com/an-update-on-the-kc-30a-from-edwards-afb-clearing-the-way-for-expanded-operations/

Question: With the situational awareness which you have on the plane, you operate the plane often to the fighter rather than forging a track to which the fighter goes.

Could you describe that capability?

Answer: We have a very good communications suite, including SATCOM, on the aircraft, as well as Link 16.

So we can see the fighters in the battlespace and we can see their fuel loads and anticipate where the need for refueling might lie.

It is about positioning yourself efficiently to refuel fighters to get them back in the fight as rapidly as possible; it is not just about being a tracked gas station in the sky.

And with our communications capabilities we can act as a relay between the fighters and other assets in the battlespace and link back to the home base as needed as well.

We can function as a communications relay for the fighter fleet as well.

Question: You are reshaping the tanker culture?

Where do your crews come from and how are they preparing for the boom part of your tanker’s future?

Answer: We have a mixture of people with fighter, tanker and airlift experience.

It is a mixed crew in terms of background.

And we have an exchange with the USAF with the KC-10 are building up our boom training and experience with them as well.

85824 random 1.0 5.0

Question: How are the coalition partners responding to your tanker and your efforts?

Answer: We are the tanker of choice.

The amount of respect we are getting from being in the Middle East, I’ve never seen anywhere else. Especially from Marines and the U.S. Navy, we constantly hear: “We want you guys every time we’re going to do a strike package.”

So whenever there’s a strike package happening, they request us when possible: “We want the Aussie KC-30 tanker on board.“

Question: The KC-30A is being used by a number of other Air Forces, although you are the lead country is using the aircraft. What have been your interactions with them?

Answer: We have growing interaction with non-USAF’s which is also broadening our mutual experience.

For example, we have an exchange with the French, whereby the French are leveraging our work to shape their transition strategy with their own tanker.

All of the clearances we are doing for ourselves benefit all the other KC-30A air forces.

And we think we are driving the entire KC-30A enterprise forward as well evolve our experience and our capabilities.

During the tests here, we have an Airbus person with us as we certify the boom.

We have embedded him in our team and put an Australian flag on his back and made him feel like one of us.

And that breaks down the barriers necessary to have the kind of innovation, which we want to see."

news by Terry Spruce 30 June 2016 Print this page

Airbus Helicopters Canada has expanded its Support and Services department at their main facility in Fort Erie, ON.

Romain Trapp, president of Airbus Helicopters Canada said: “It is our main priority to keep our customers‘ aircraft operating at peak performance. With this expansion, we will increase the efficiency of our Repair and Overhaul capabilities, resulting in faster turn-around-time when an aircraft requires service.”

“An operator’s competitiveness is directly linked to the amount of time their aircraft is flying. We are committed to taking the steps necessary to ensure we support our customers’ ability to succeed, as their success will ultimately become a reflection of our own,” Trapp added.

The expansion of Airbus Helicopters Canada’s Repair and Overhaul department is a direct result of the high demand for service from customers both domestically and internationally. Five years ago there was a dramatic increase in AS350/H125 aircraft sales worldwide. With 300 – 600 flight hours per year, many of these aircraft are coming due for overhaul. Today, there are currently 522 AS350/H125’s flying in Canada."

Airbus Helicopters, the top player in China's civil helicopter market, believes China will surpass the United States to be the world's biggest civil helicopter market soon－and aims to increase its market share from the current 40 percent to 60 percent by 2020.

""The Chinese civil (helicopter) market might be the biggest one in the world in 2018 for light single and light twin helicopters and definitely before 2020,"" said Norbert Ducrot, president and CEO of Airbus Helicopters China.

""With the further opening up of the Chinese low-altitude airspace and the increasing growth in the civil and parapublic segments, China is gearing up to be the biggest market for helicopters in years to come,"" he said.

The parapublic sector is composed of a wide range of public missions that include police use, medical evacuation, search and rescue, use by utility companies and firefighting.

The helicopter maker is set to build its first ever final assembly line in China. It signed an agreement on Monday with a Chinese consortium to form an industrial partnership to launch an H135 helicopter final assembly line in Qingdao, Shandong province.

The consortium is made up of China Aviation Supplies Holding Company, Qingdao United General Aviation Industrial Development Company and CITIC Offshore Helicopter Co Ltd.

The move fulfilled the commitment of purchasing 100 H135s, which are worth about 700 million euros ($788 million), signed in the letter of intent last year between the consortium and Airbus Helicopters. The order of 100 H135s will be assembled in China over the next 10 years.

The assembly line is expected to start operations by 2018, to assemble up to 300 H135s over the next 10 years, said Ducrot, who estimated an output of 1,000 to 1,200 H135s in the coming 20 years.

According to the agreement, a joint venture between Airbus Helicopters and the consortium will be established soon. Airbus Helicopters will hold ""more than 50 percent of the shares,"" said Ducrot.

The consortium will also be Airbus Helicopter's biggest distributor in China, as it has ordered 100 H135s.

Last month, the State Council released a regulation about the development of the country's general aviation industry. It set several goals by 2020, including 1 trillion yuan ($151 billion) market value for the sector and 500 airports from the current 300.

The new regulation opened up more areas up for civil use, expanded their use in disaster relief, environmental monitoring and resource exploration. The regulation also allowed for promotion of research and increased manufacturing in the sector.

The number of helicopters in China now stands at around 750. Over the past five years the market has seen an annual sales of about 100 helicopters. Ducrot said the country will need another 5,000 to 10,000 helicopters and private jets in the foreseeable future.

Airbus sold 40 helicopters in China last year. The company plans to sell over 60 this year. Ducrot said within next week, the order book for the first six months will stand at more than 45 units."

Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev praised the plane, which will complete certification in 2017, at a fancy reception in Siberia. He called the plane ""cool,"" and urged that Russia become an elite player in aerospace.

Western sanctions against Russia have led to increasing calls for domestic production, and the MC-21 300 stands to be a shining role model. The plane has Russian-built turbofans and Russian-built avionics. While the plane has gone through delays, there was no sense of caution in Medvedev's speech.

Iran's beleaguered national airline is finally getting some relief.

On Wednesday, news emerged from Tehran, the Iran Air has reportedly reached an agreement with Boeing for 100 airliners.

Should the rumored Boeing deal reach completion, it would be Iran Air's second multibillion airplane acquisition this year.

In January, Iran Air and Airbus agreed to a historic deal for 118 airliners with a list value topping $25 billion.

On Thursday, Iran Air got even more good news.

The European Commission announced that it will allow the airline to once again fly into European airspace.

""Following my visit to Iran in April, a technical assessment was successfully carried out in May,"" EU transport commissioner Violeta Bulc said in a statement.

""Based on this I am happy to announce that we are now also able to allow most aircraft from Iran Air back into European skies.""

Since the Revolution of 1979, the country has suffered through decades of severe economic sanctions that have had a devastating effect on the country's commercial aviation industry and its national airline.

Iran Air, once one of the region's most respected airlines, has fallen on hard times.

Airbus A300B4 Iran Air

For much of the past 30 years, trade sanctions have prevented the airline from acquiring new planes directly from western airplane makers.

As a result, Iran Air have been forced to make do with an aging fleet of early generation Airbus aircraft and pre-revolution Boeing jumbo jets. According to Airfleets.net, Iran Air's fleet of 46 jets have an average age of 27 years with its fleet of Boeing 747s pushing 40 years of service.

And what planes they do have, the airline often struggles to find adequate spare parts to keep them running properly.

Accidents resulting for mechanical failures became increasingly common, leading the EU to ban most of Iran Air's planes in 2010.

Story continues

Iran Air Boeing 747

But even with this week's announcement, the airline's Boeing 747s and Fokker 100s are still considered too unsafe to be allowed to fly over Europe.

Unfortunately for Iran Air, those two aircraft types account for nearly half of its fleet, according to Airfleets.net.

But with the country's landmark deal to curb nuclear activities in January, expect the resurgence of Iran's aviation sector increase in pace over the next few years.

With nearly 220 planes on order, Iran Air and its management are looking to return the once world-class carrier to its previous luster. At this rate, Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar Airways may have a new regional power with which to contend.

At dawn we pedal: Airbus employees bike to work - AL.com,"Fri, 10 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzL21vYmlsZS8yMDE2LzA2L2F0X2Rhd25fd2VfcGVkYWxfYWlyYnVzX2VtcGxveS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It's an hour before sunrise and I'm standing outside a west Mobile gas station with two Frenchmen, and one of them, Mathieu Joncour, is explaining that when we bicycle up the on-ramp and onto I-65, that's when we really have to start pedaling for all we're worth.

Even in a scenario that involves a pre-dawn Deep South rendezvous with known Europeans, this seems like a stretch. Cedric Gaudet, seeing the skeptical look slowly dawning on my sleep-deprived face, laughs. ""He loves this joke,"" he says of Joncour. I'm just the latest victim.

We don't take the interstate, but in a few minutes we are barreling eastward on U.S. 90. It's well-lit and lightly traveled at this hour; from the pace Joncour and Gaudet set, you might suspect they hail from a country that knows a thing or two about bicycle racing.

Another clue that they're not from around here: Over the course of the ride, we pass at least two Waffle Houses and one Dunkin Donuts, and they don't even broach the subject of stopping. Not even as a possibility. Not even as a joke.

Anyway, we don't have time to stop. We're in danger of being late ... for a bike ride. So we zoom down the I-65 service road to Halls Mill Road, work our way along dark two-lanes to Dauphin Island Parkway, cross I-10, then swoop around the Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley on Perimeter Road to Broad Street, which takes us to Arlington Park, the starting point for the Mobile version of a worldwide Airbus event, Bike to Work Day.

At Arlington Park, 30 or so Airbus employees have gathered, and in the middle of them is Vincent Seurot, handing out reflective safety jerseys. One of my riding companions earlier described him as ""the crazy one,"" but he demurs. In fact he just seems to be very enthusiastic about the cause of cycling. He was involved in Bike to Work Day at the Airbus factory outside Saint-Nazaire, France, which might draw as many as 300 riders, he says. He was instrumental in bringing the company tradition to the Mobile plant.

When I asked Joncour how cycling in Alabama compares to cycling in France, he said that here it's ""10 times more dangerous and maybe 10 times warmer as well."" And this is from a guy who bikes to work two or three times a week, which includes a return trip during midafternoon traffic.

Seurot is a little more optimistic. ""I think it's not the case,"" he says. ""If you are visible, you have the law, you have everything."" He says he misses bike lanes and other cycling-friendly infrastructure, but sees those things beginning to be implemented thanks to advocacy groups such as the Delta Bike Project. He thinks it's important for the much-debated I-10 bridge project to include a bike lane.

When it's time for the group to roll out of Arlington Park, they do so at a gentle pace. The pack includes road bikes, mountain bikes and fat-tired single-speed cruisers. Most of the riders drove to work as usual, then pedaled over from the plant, and that makes this ride largely symbolic. But some of those taking part, including Jennifer Stokes, have done little to no riding since they were kids, so there's nothing symbolic about a four-mile cruise for them. (Stokes, the environmental coordinator in the engineering center, has brought a group of nine from that department.)

The group rolls down a little-used road that follows the curve of the shoreline, through territory that once was used as the University of South Alabama's Brookley Campus and as a golf course. It's a rare experience, getting to roll through a stretch of prime bayfront property that's currently closed to the public. When a break in the treeline gives a perfect view of sunrise over the bay, everybody stops.

A little while later, the group rolls into Airbus' compound and stops for a group photo and some breakfast, before people begin to break away and head inside to start the day's shift.

Symbolic or not, Bike to Work day was a good time. And like everything else about Airbus' impact on Mobile, it seems likely to grow in the years to come.

UK firm that helped track MH370 will fit 'cloud black box' on Airbus jets - The Guardian,"Thu, 30 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE2L2p1bi8zMC91ay1zYXRlbGxpdGUtZmlybS1pbm1hcnNhdC1oZWxwZWQtdHJhY2stbWgzNzAtZml0LXNicy1vbi1haXJidXMtamV0c9IBdWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE2L2p1bi8zMC91ay1zYXRlbGxpdGUtZmlybS1pbm1hcnNhdC1oZWxwZWQtdHJhY2stbWgzNzAtZml0LXNicy1vbi1haXJidXMtamV0cw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European plane maker Airbus is to install technology built by British firm Inmarsat that will render the black box virtually obsolete and could prevent air disasters.

Inmarsat, the satellite company that helped Malaysia Airlines pinpoint the likely flight path of the downed MH370 airliner, said the technology was a “gamechanger” for airline safety.

It beams flight information via a satellite to an airline’s control centre within seconds, capturing real-time data about what is happening onboard the plane.

This is particularly important if an aeroplane crashes into the sea, because signals sent by a flight recorder, or black box, typically stop within weeks as its batteries run down.

This leaves investigators unable to access crucial data about the cause of an accident, as in the case of MH370, whose black box has yet to be found.

Inmarsat said the new technology – called SwiftBroadband-Safety (SB-S) and dubbed the “black box in the cloud” – could prevent a crash by speeding up communication between the cockpit and the ground in the event of a mechanical problem or terrorist incident.

Airbus will fit SB-S technology in A320 single-aisle planes and A330 wide-body aircraft from 2018 if it gets regulatory approval.

British defence firm Cobham was selected by Airbus to build the onboard equipment that will be fitted on the planes and connected to Inmarsat’s satellite network.

A former pilot, captain Mary McMillan, who is Inmarsat’s head of safety, said SB-S technology could not only help identify the cause of accidents but could even prevent them.

“This is a gamechanger for safety,” said McMillan, a 30-year veteran of the aviation industry with more than 12,000 hours of flight time under her belt. “I was flying on 9/11 and the difficulty of getting information back and forth was one of the issues of that time.

“There is a limited capability for aircraft to stream data depending on links they are using. The difference in being able to send a small amount of data is you have to pick and choose what you send.

“The ability to stream large amounts of data will give us an awareness in real time of a developing situation about what’s taking place on an aircraft.”

She said the technology could allow staff on the ground to intervene to prevent an accident, “whether it’s a response to a mechanical problem or a terrorist situation”.

Aircraft are already capable of sending live information, but the data is often incomplete and takes longer to send due to slow speeds.

Inmarsat said SB-S was a “paradigm shift” in aviation safety “due to its unprecedented speed and capacity, which are several orders of magnitude greater than cockpit communications systems in the market today”.

Industry sources said Hawaiian Airlines has already tested the SB-S technology and that it has worked well.

Inmarsat was instrumental in determining the flight path of MH370, which crashed on 8 March 2014 with 239 on board while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

The cause of the crash has never been identified, leaving air safety firms, pilots and conspiracy theorists to speculate on the events leading up to its disappearance."

Can a New Boeing 777X-10 Threaten Airbus A380 Superjumbo? - 24/7 Wall St.,"Thu, 30 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3d2FsbHN0LmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UtZGVmZW5zZS8yMDE2LzA2LzMwL2Nhbi1hLW5ldy1ib2VpbmctNzc3eC0xMC10aHJlYXRlbi1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1zdXBlcmp1bWJvL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Can a New Boeing 777X-10 Threaten Airbus A380 Superjumbo? courtesy of the Boeing Co.

The Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) is reportedly considering a stretched version of its yet-to-delivered 777X to compete with the Airbus Group SE’s A380 double-decked, superjumbo jet. A report Wednesday from Bloomberg News said that Boeing has talked with several carriers about the so-called 777-10X, including Middle East carrier Emirates, the largest operator of both 777s and A380s.

A dual-engine, widebody 777-10X would add about 4 extra rows of seats and carry around 450 passengers. The A380 is capable of carrying around 485 to more than 600 passengers on its four-engine, widebody, double-decked airframe. Configured as a single-class (economy), an airline could stuff nearly 840 seats on the A380’s two decks.

Emirates has been pressing Airbus to put new engines on the A380-800, a decision that Airbus continues stalling on because Emirates is essentially the only customer for the plane. But the airline has promised to order 200 of the re-engined planes if Airbus builds it.

A 777-10X would carry about 450 passengers, roughly as many as a Boeing 747-8. If the Bloomberg report is accurate, Boeing appears to want to position the 777-10X as a modern replacement for the decades old 747. So the question the company has to ask itself is if there is still a market for a 747-size aircraft. And if there is, how important will fuel costs be when the plane finally makes it to market?

The first 777-9X is not scheduled to begin production until next year and first customer deliveries are not expected until 2020. A 777-10X may take up to two or three additional years to get to customers.

Neither Boeing nor Emirates would comment directly on the Bloomberg report except to say the usual things about new products are always being considered and that regular discussions about new products are part of everyday business.

With a price tag of $400 million, the 777-9X is the most expensive plane on Boeing’s price list. The A380 carries a price tag of $428 million per copy. A re-engined version of the A380 would certainly add to that price and a 777-10X would probably come in at somewhere near the current cost of an A380.

We won’t know the price tag of a new 777-10X until Boeing decides if it will build the plane, but the company typically releases its new price list at the beginning of July so at least we’ll find out how much the company’s planes will cost for the next 12 months. Last year Boeing boosted prices by 2.9% across the board.

Fighting global warming from space - Airbus,"Mon, 20 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE2LTA2LWZpZ2h0aW5nLWdsb2JhbC13YXJtaW5nLWZyb20tc3BhY2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Helping monitor climate change

From Brazil to Central and West Africa, countries are relying on satellite imaging to set up their reforestation initiatives and conservation strategies

Forests as climate stabilisers

The battle against global warming is being fought in the world’s largest forests through the use of highly accurate satellite imagery.

Airbus Defence and Space satellite constellations are helping to create breathing room for Earth’s lungs by providing data for forest monitoring and management across the world, from Central and West Africa to Brazil and Southeast Asia.

Thirty percent of the Earth’s land surface is covered by forest, which acts as a crucial climate stabiliser.

When forests are cleared, cut or burned, stored carbon is released into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide and methane.

20% of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 30% of CO2 emissions are caused by deforestation and forest degradation, according to the UN’s REDD Programme and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). This is more than the world’s entire transport sector and second only to the global energy sector.

A threat to biodiversity

The Congo Basin’s jungles are the world’s second-largest tropical forest cover, extending across 300 million hectares.

Aside from its contribution to global warming, deforestation in the Congo Basin and other regions also leads to soil desertification, droughts, loss of biodiversity and social deprivation for the 1.6 billion people worldwide who rely on forest resources for their livelihoods.

SPOT–light on Central and West Africa



Through a programme with the French Development Agency (AFD), Airbus Defence and Space has been providing SPOT satellite images to national agencies in five countries in the Congo Basin for the last five years: Cameroon, Central African Republic, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Gabon.



“It’s an open licence approach for those involved in the sustainable management of forests and development of responsible agro-industries,” says Patrick Houdry, in charge of intelligence activities for forest and environment markets at Airbus DS. “Local actors like NGOs can better analyse forest preservation, for example, and have precise information on what the local drivers of deforestation are.”

Better carbon emissions tracking

From March 2016, a new project known as OSFACO (Space-Based Observation of the Forests of Central and West Africa), supported by the AFD, is extending its coverage to Guinea, Benin and the Ivory Coast, supplying satellite imagery with a resolution of up to 1.5 metres. These images allow for a thorough survey of forest cover and land use over large expanses that are otherwise difficult to access and monitor.

Together with providing the images, Airbus DS focuses on capacity-building initiatives and the training of local geo-information experts. “Instead of telling them what to do,” says Houdry, “we want them to have autonomy, to become the protagonists of their own development.”

The programme has also provided participants with forest maps and REDD+ baselines from 1990–2010, which will help them access funds from the United Nations’ REDD/REDD+ deforestation programmes.

This information also helps countries make political decisions, balancing deforestation reduction and pushing agricultural development forward.

Biomass: ESA’s forest mission

One of the latest developments in the Earth Observation field will be the construction of Biomass, a new European Space Agency satellite. Biomass will deploy the first P-band radar antenna in space, helping to deliver land usage and global forest cover information with unprecedented accuracy.

From 2010–2015, SPOT satellites delivered coverage of almost 3 million square kilometres in the Congo Basin and contributed to the mapping of African forests, including historical analysis of deforestation over the past 15 years.

UN REDD: Guardians of climate change

The United Nations has two global programmes to fight deforestation in developing countries called REDD/REDD+. The project’s technical staff, Inge Jonckheere and Erik Lindquist, explain how it works.



How has satellite imaging helped to develop REDD/REDD+?

Inge Jonckheere: In order to reduce emissions, national authorities need a good view of the problem. But many countries, for example, those in the Congo Basin, did not have historical data or a forest inventory. Often, the only way you can get a national inventory here is through satellite data. Thanks to the images and the recent decision to make historical archives freely available, we know what is happening in each country in a transparent way.

How has the Congo Basin Project worked out?

Erik Lindquist: We are talking about the second largest tropical forest outside the Amazon. While Brazil has a more mature tracking system, for geopolitical reasons, the Congo Basin countries, for geopolitical reasons, have not been as well-recorded. This is an area where the world is focusing because it is very valuable for the whole Earth system. Thanks to the help of data providers like Airbus, we were able to set the capacities needed, build trust relationships and educate local technicians. It is great news that the original project is being renewed for three more years.

What are the new goals being pursued by the project?

I.J: The new phase is focusing on forest degradation. Lots of countries wanted to participate in REDD but they couldn’t, due to low deforestation rates. In those countries, forest degradation was the issue, and now REDD+ is focusing on this other aspect. Satellite imaging will remain crucial in this task. E. L: We know more than we have ever known about how the planet is changing, and we owe the data providers for that. We trust that they’ll continue their contribution, helping the international community and national governments make the right decisions to combat climate change.

The many faces of deforestation

Preserving the world’s forests is not only about fighting deforestation but also battling illegal crops, degradation and desertification. Airbus DS FOREST is a game-changing tool for countries that want a detailed picture of the problem.



7 million hectares of forest disappear every year, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations

One tool to fight global warming

Many countries lack the resources to track changes in vegetation cover or even know their historical record. Moreover, positive outcomes of COP21, new entrants in the REDD+ market and new challenges faced by some countries demand higher quality mapping and monitoring tools.

Combining vegetation models and satellite imagery, Airbus DS FOREST (Fully Optimized and Reliable EmissionS Tool) helps track tree cover over large swaths of land and even determine how much carbon dioxide is stored within specific areas. This, in turn, helps countries participate in the global carbon emissions trade system.

FOREST is designed to make a positive impact on climate change. The joint effort incorporates Airbus Defence and Space optical (SPOT, Pleiades constellations) and radar (TanDEM-X, TerraSAR-X) data, as well as integrating Sentinel 2 and free images from other satellites. This imagery is combined with the expertise of several research institutes and private companies specialised in forestry, CO2 emission calculations and climate solutions.

""I’m very happy to see how our services are used directly on the ground; basically every country that has a tropical forest has shown interest.""



Alexandra Nouillas

FOREST project manager

A more powerful 'detective' for illegal logging

FOREST helps reveal illegal logging and illicit crops that are otherwise very hard to spot.

Pierre Duquesne, Intelligence expert at Airbus DS Brazil, explains how satellite imagery is already making a difference here. “Previously, huge expanses of trees were cut, but over the years the patterns of illegal deforestation have changed because loggers are increasingly being spotted by satellites. Now they tend to log smaller patches so the deforestation is not detectable from space.

Airbus Defence and Space DMC satellites have a higher resolution and are used by the INPE Brazilian Space Research Institute to detect even these minor-scale activities.”

Loggers in Brazil are now also operating during the rainy season so that clouds may shroud their activities. This explains why Brazilian authorities are evaluating Airbus DSTerrasar-X radar images, which penetrate the clouds and can detect changes in the canopy

Sustainable development for tropical forest

With the commercialisation phase kicking off in September 2016, FOREST end users will include institutions that enforce forestry management policies, private companies that conduct impact studies of their activities, countries that implement international programmes like the UN’s REDD+ and investors in carbon-based trading.

“We already have success stories,” says Alexandra Nouillas, FOREST project manager. “We have fine-tuned the tool with demonstration workshops and trainings in several thematic applications in Cameroon, Brazil and Peru.”

A month later, following the preliminary findings of Norway’s Accident Investigation Board (AIBN), investigators are urgently requesting the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to suspend the operations of the Super Puma H225 fleet. Anthony Tucker-Jones reports.

Can it be that stalwart of military airlift the Super Puma is finally losing its lustre amid mounting safety concerns? Only last year, as part of Eurocopter’s rebranding as Airbus, the Eurocopter EC225 Super Puma was renamed the H225.

The warning signs came earlier this year when Airbus announced it was cutting back production of its H225 by 50 per cent due to falling military sales.

Although military and civilian operators of the H225 are about 50:50, military sales are inevitably more important because of the unit numbers involved.

Airbus as with all other helicopter manufacturers is feeling the pinch because civilian demand has been cut by the depressed oil price. This inevitably was going to spill over into military procurement as well.

Sales of the H225M military variant are now grappling with a public relations disaster. Airbus acknowledges public confidence in the H225 has been seriously shaken after a series of unwelcome civilian accidents – the most recent in April this year off Norway.

The cause of the Norway crash, following the catastrophic loss of the rotor assembly has been put down to fatigue causing a main rotor gearbox failure Read more.

An H225 was lost due to pilot error in 2009; three years later two came down in the North Sea due to gearbox problems. The gearbox design was modified and that seemed to be the end of the matter.

As a result of the latest accident civil flight bans in the UK and Norway on the H225 and the AS332 variant of Super Puma could not have come at a worse time for Airbus. Public confidence has been so badly shaken there has even been a call for a permanent ban in the UK.

In the view of the UK Civil Aviation Authority the H225 and AS332 are the same thing. They took a similar approach in 2013.

The AS332 Super Puma is a proven military workhorse but the original design is almost 40 years old now, its much-upgraded predecessor the SA330 Puma even older. The AS332 has an extensive crash record with both military and civilian operators dating back to the late 1980s.

In recent years the Spanish Air Force lost two and an AS532 Cougar, military variant, crashed in France in 2012.

In light of this and ongoing safety concerns it is easy to see why potential military customers are very hesitant to commit with Airbus.

Brazil, with 50 H225M on order after receiving less than 50 per cent has put the brakes on further deliveries due to the state of its economy. For Airbus this is an unwelcome blow at a time when it is struggling to secure firm sales for 90 H225M to India, Kuwait and Poland – the latter accounts for 50 of them and Kuwait 24.

Last year after criticism of the selection process the Polish Government was threatening to pull out of the H225M deal. Singapore is also seeking a dozen new helicopters to replace its fleet of aging of AS332/532 – but may be now having second thoughts about going back to Airbus.

Reportedly the H225 is to stay in production until 2030 and it is planned there will be an overlap with its successor the proposed X6 – which has yet to leave the drawing board. In the meantime Airbus will need to work hard if military sales are ever to recover the growing scandal over the Norwegian crash. This poses the question has Super Puma had its day?"
Etihad Air Serbia jet arriving - Business Insider,"Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZXRpaGFkLWFpci1zZXJiaWEtYWlyYnVzLW9wZW4tc2tpZXMtMjAxNi020gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9ldGloYWQtYWlyLXNlcmJpYS1haXJidXMtb3Blbi1za2llcy0yMDE2LTY_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On Thursday, an Air Serbia Airbus A330-200 landed at New York's JFK International Airport. It was the first time the Serbian capital of Belgrade has had direct air service to New York City in 24 years.

The arrival of this Serbian Airbus embodies US-based airlines' worst fears over the continued growth of the Middle East's three mega carriers.

For years, the US-based airlines American, Delta, and United have accused the Middle Eastern carriers Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar of benefiting from more than $42 billion in illegal subsidies.

It's an accusation that the CEOs of the ME3 have consistently rebutted. Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar all point to their audited financial statements as proof of their profitability as businesses.

But what does Serbia's national airline have to do with the Persian Gulf's mega carriers?

Air Serbia — along with Air Berlin, Virgin Australia, Jet Airways, Air Seychelles, Etihad Regional, and Alitalia — make up Etihad's equity partnership network. That means that Etihad, based in the United Arab Emirates' capital, Abu Dhabi, owns up to 49% of each airline.

Etihad doesn't participate in the day-to-day operations of a partner airline, but it does make its presence felt, Air Serbia CEO Dane Kondic told Business Insider in an interview this week.

""What they do do is play the role of an enabler,"" he said.

AP

Kondic believes his airline's landmark flight to New York is a great example of how the partnership has been a benefit to his company.



The Airbus A330 used for the route was leased from Jet Airways, while the Air Serbia pilots were trained in Italy by Alitalia. At the same time, Etihad provided Air Serbia with ground staff in the US as well as training for its cabin crew.

Though highly complimentary of US airlines, Etihad Aviation Group CEO James Hogan was quick to point out a key advantage his airline has over American competitors.

""Although (US Carriers) form the backbone of the three global airline alliances, what we've done and they haven't done is decrease operating complexity across the partnership airlines,"" Hogan told us in an interview this week.

Hogan said Air Berlin, Alitalia, and others in the partnership were looking to share everything from fleets to computer systems to training. The airlines are even looking to streamline the interior layouts of their aircraft so planes can easily be shifted between different fleets depending on demand.

This is the type of synergy that allows an airline like Air Serbia to expand into the US market.

""A small impoverished airline such as ours would never in a million years be able to fly across the Atlantic if it wasn't for us being a part of this group of like-minded airlines coming together as Etihad Airways partners,"" Kondic said.

Kondic is right. On its own, with a fleet of 21 aircraft, three-year-old Air Serbia would not be capable of operating trans-Atlantic service.

But with the assistance of its partners, Air Serbia has managed to build an unexpected air bridge between Belgrade and New York.

On a larger scale, Etihad's partnership network represents the next evolution of the Emirati carrier's global expansion.

Growth through these partnerships allows Etihad to increase the airline's reach organically. And with the governments of Serbia and Italy writing off the old debt of their national airlines ahead of Etihad's entry, the company is able to focus on building for the future instead of worrying about the past.

Instead of forcing its way into markets outside its traditional area of operation, such as Emirates' route between Milan and New York, Etihad can use its partnership method to expand while turning potentially adversarial governments into stakeholders.

After all, it's easy for both the Americans and the Italians to make a big fuss about Emirates' Milan route. But Etihad's Alitalia service would be beyond reproach.

US airlines simply aren't in a position to protest the Italian national airline's operation out of Rome or the Serbian national airline's operation out of Belgrade.

Etihad doesn't have to expand further into US or European market on its own. It has a German, a Swiss, an Italian, and a Serbian airline to do it by proxy.

With Etihad's equity partnership hitting its stride, further encroachment into the US carriers' prized trans-Atlantic business is bound to continue.

And there isn't anything the airline's US critics can do about it."
AIBN: Main gearbox fatigue fracture 'likely cause' of Norway H225 crash - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 28 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlibi1tYWluLWdlYXJib3gtZmF0aWd1ZS1mcmFjdHVyZS1saWtlbHktY2F1c2Utb2Ytbm9yd2F5LWgyMjUtY3Jhc2gv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Norwegian investigators have said a fatigue fracture in the main gearbox (MGB) was the most likely cause of the fatal Airbus Helicopters H225 crash near Turoy, Norway, on April 29, and said the fracture propagated in a manner unlikely to be detected by existing mandatory or supplementary systems. The information was released in the Accident Investigation Board of Norway’s (AIBN’s) latest preliminary report — its fourth since the investigation began — in which it said the fracture was in one of the aircraft’s second stage planet gears, but said the cause of the fracture had not yet been determined. The aircraft (LN-OJF), operated by CHC Helicopter, had been returning to Bergen Airport Flesland from the Gullfaks B platform in the North Sea when a catastrophic failure resulted in its main rotor head and mast detaching in flight. The aircraft crashed into a small island near Turoy, exploding on impact, and killing all 13 on board. The latest report drew comparisons to the fatigue fracture found in the second stage planet gear in the epicyclic module of an Airbus Helicopters AS332 L2 (G-REDL) that crashed off the coast of Peterhead, Scotland, in 2009. In that instance, a catastrophic failure of the helicopter’s main rotor gearbox caused the main rotor and part of the epicyclic module to separate from the fuselage, and all 16 on board were killed as the aircraft hit the sea at high speed. After an extensive investigation, the main rotor gearbox failure was found to be caused by a fatigue fracture of a second stage planet gear in the epicyclic module.

“Even though some differences are observed when comparing the LN-OJF accident with the G-REDL accident, the fatigue fractured planet gears, however, show clear similarities,” the AIBN’s report states. Since the last report, released on June 1, investigators said they have completed further examinations into the three different failure modes under consideration for the cause of the crash — suspension bar (lift strut) attachment, the MGB, and conical housing — and, at this stage, it believed the fatigue fracture of the planet gear to be the most likely cause of the loss of the main rotor. “It is considered unlikely that this fatigue crack propagated as a consequence of a structural break-up of another component,” the report states. The AIBN said the accident aircraft’s gearbox had been involved in a road accident in 2015 — though it had been inspected, repaired and released for flight by Airbus Helicopters before it was installed in the aircraft in January 2016. “Whether there is a link between this event and the initiation and growth of a fatigue fracture, is being investigated,” the report states. The report said the AIBN has completed detailed metallurgical examinations on various components from the accident aircraft, with the participation of Airbus Helicopters, and said two pieces “have been of particular interest.” These pieces represent about half of a second stage planet gear. “Examinations of these parts show that one of the fracture surfaces can be described as being close to 100 percent fatigue,” the report states.

According to the report, the fatigue appears to have its origin in the outer race of the bearing (inside of the gear), propagating towards the web of the gear teeth. Scans from x-ray computed tomography showed several cracks below the surface of the outer race. One crack runs below the surface between areas of surface damage. “An essential design philosophy regarding a possible failure inside the epicyclic module has been that propagation of a crack would be suppressed by the compressive surface stress,” the report states. “Thus a crack in the surface area should grow outboard and create spalling that would produce magnetic debris, which will be detected on the magnetic plugs (chip detectors). The optional HUMS [health and usage monitoring system] is an additional means for detecting developing degradation.” The AIBN notes that this issue was discussed in connection with the crash of G-REDL, and that measures were taken to improve the detection of spalling.

“No findings indicate any malfunctions to the magnetic debris detection system on LN-OJF, or [failure] to follow procedures for visual inspection and checks before flight. Neither are there any records of magnetic debris findings from inspections made since the gearbox was installed on LN-OJF in January 2016,” the report states. “The observed failure mode in this investigation seems to differ from what was expected or foreseen during certification. AIBN believes that a sub-surface crack has propagated without creating a significant amount of magnetic debris from spalling. Also, the HUMS appears unable to identify symptoms of such degradation in the epicyclic module.”"

Airbus to test solution for A400M helicopter refuelling - Flightglobal,"Tue, 21 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMvYWlyYnVzLXRvLXRlc3Qtc29sdXRpb24tZm9yLWE0MDBtLWhlbGljb3B0ZXItcmVmdWVsbGluZy8xMjA5MTEuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Defence & Space believes it has found a solution to a problem that was late last year revealed as leaving its A400M tactical transport incapable of refuelling helicopters in flight.

During a previous test campaign performed with an Airbus Helicopters H225M, both the airflow behind the Atlas and the rotorcraft’s proximity to its T-tail meant that the air-to-air refuelling activity could not be safely completed using a standard, 24.4m (80ft)-long hose.

Airbus Defence & Space

Speaking at the company’s Ottobrunn site near Munich on 20 June, head of engineering Miguel Angel Morrell said windtunnel testing of a potential solution has been conducted in Spain, with Onera. Representing the second phase of a company-funded research and development activity, this modelled using a hose-and-drogue design with a deployed length of 36.6m.

Morrell says the company will be testing a stiffer hose design than used previously, and that this will also have to be narrower in diameter, in order to fit within the same Cobham pod design. This will result in a slower fuel flow, although Airbus has yet to determine its exact effect on overall refuelling time.

Airbus says an assessment of the windtunnel test results is ongoing, and that “a flight-test programme will follow, to fully validate the results of the previous phases”. This is expected to include conducting proximity trials with an instrumented H225M before the end of this year, says Morrell.

“Hopefully this [issue] will be solved, and in the next years we will have the capability on the A400M,” Morrell says. The type is already capable of refuelling fixed-wing aircraft.

The A400M’s inability to provide air-to-air refuelling support to helicopters has already prompted the French air force to order two Lockheed Martin KC-130J tankers to support its H225M Caracal fleet.

Separately, Airbus will perform full refuelling trials of a roll-on, roll-off refuelling system on its C295 medium transport later this year.

“In July we expect to do a dry contact with a C295, and with a helicopter by the end of this year,” says Morrell. Earlier flight testing has demonstrated “a very stable hose, and with no oscillations on retraction”, he adds.

Fix For A400M's Cracked Propeller Gearbox Awaits Approval - Defense News,"Fri, 17 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbnNlbmV3cy5jb20vZGlnaXRhbC1zaG93LWRhaWxpZXMvZXVyb3NhdG9yeS8yMDE2LzA2LzE3L2ZpeC1mb3ItYTQwMG0tcy1jcmFja2VkLXByb3BlbGxlci1nZWFyYm94LWF3YWl0cy1hcHByb3ZhbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris – The European authorities are due to certify a modified Avio propeller gearbox in September, an interim solution required after a crack was found on the present equipment on the Airbus A400M airlifter, French defense-procurement chief Laurent Collet-Billon said.

A new gearbox is needed following discovery of a crack in the existing system, which led to a tightening of routine inspection between flights.

If the European Aviation Safety Agency delivers a certification of the propeller gearbox in ""early September,"" Airbus Defence & Space can fit the equipment to the engines and allow hundreds more flying hours between inspections, the chief of the Direction Générale de l'Armement procurement office said on Tuesday at the Eurosatory trade show, which closed June 17.

Industrial work on a new gearbox is being backed by Avio's US parent company, General Electric. ""They are serious people,"" Collet-Billon said. Fitting the new gearbox is ""indispensable"" and would allow the plane to fly hundreds of flight hours between checks.

After the crack was discovered, the present gearbox is inspected after every 20 flight hours and an initial 200 hours.

The plan is for an ""intermediate solution"" to be certified in September, to be followed by a new gearbox as a long-term response, a DGA spokesman said.

The DGA took delivery June 8 of its ninth A400M, fitted with a self-protection kit and other ""tactical capabilities,"" the procurement office said in a statement.

Having defensive countermeasures is a key requirement for French pilots flying the A400M in the skies over sub-Saharan Africa in the Barkhane mission.

Other features on the newest French A400M include the capability for parachute drops, use of short runways, refueling fighter and transport aircraft, and being refueled, the DGA said June 15.

France expects to receive this year two more new A400Ms in the tactical standard, with a retrofit of three units already in service. The Air Force has long requested the ""tactical"" version to extend the mission beyond a simple cargo plane.

An in-flight refueling of helicopters is among the requirements, but that capability will take more time to deliver, along with the parachute drop from both sides of the fuselage.

Eight nation clients – Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Turkey and Malaysia – are waiting for a new delivery schedule for the A400M. The timetable will set out the revised plan for production and upgrades for the turboprop plane."

OSLO (Reuters) - The fatal crash of an Airbus helicopter in Norway in April was probably the result of metal fatigue in the aircraft's gearbox, the country's Accident Investigation Board (AIBN) said in a preliminary report on Tuesday, backing earlier findings. All 13 people on board were killed when the Super Puma's main rotor blades separated from the aircraft as it was ferrying passengers from a Norwegian offshore oil platform operated by Statoil. The European Aviation Safety Authority on June 2 grounded H225 LP and AS332 L2 Super Pumas following the discovery of metal fatigue in the gearbox of the crashed helicopter. The AIBN said metallurgical examinations through x-ray scans had strengthened its belief that the failure took place in the gearbox. ""At this stage of the investigation, the AIBN finds that the accident most likely was the result of a fatigue fracture in one of the second stage planet gears,"" the report said. ""What initiated the fatigue fracture has not yet been determined."" Two other scenarios had also been investigated, but neither appeared to have caused the crash, the AIBN added. ""It is considered unlikely that (the) fatigue crack propagated as a consequence of a structural break-up of another component,"" it said. The helicopter that crashed was operated by Canada-based group CHC Helicopter [CHCEL.UL]. Investigators have previously ruled out human error, saying the crash was caused by a technical fault. Previous Super Puma incidents linked to gearbox problems included a 2009 crash off Peterhead, Scotland, in which the rotor also flew off and 16 people died.
