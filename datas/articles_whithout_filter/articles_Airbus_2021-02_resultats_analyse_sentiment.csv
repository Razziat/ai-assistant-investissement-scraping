"Electronic Flight Bag, the new standard | FAST Online | News - Airbus Aircraft","Thu, 18 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vYWlyY3JhZnQuYWlyYnVzLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzcm9vbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEtMDItZWxlY3Ryb25pYy1mbGlnaHQtYmFnLXRoZS1uZXctc3RhbmRhcmTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For several years, the Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) has been bringing the most up-to-date technology into the cockpit. As it has become the standard way of operations, all Airbus operators must transfer to full EFB-based operation by the end of 2021. From 2022, Airbus will no longer be providing information for operators to deviate from this standard way.

The EFB aims at replacing the on-board paper documentation by providing the flight crew with:

Performance applications to compute the aircraft loadsheet and performance at take-off, cruise and landing

An application to manage the Checklists and Procedures

A browser to access flight operations documentation, e.g. Flight Crew Operating Manual (FCOM), Flight Crew Techniques Manual (FCTM), Minimum Equipment List (MEL)

Mission data, e.g. flight plan, navigation charts, flight folder

What will change for airlines

From 2022, airlines will rely on performance software to determine aircraft performance data during operation. This is why, at the end of 2021, Airbus will be removing all performance data from the operational documentation and will only provide information which supports/enables the use of an EFB.

EFB across the Airbus Family

Pilot with A320 typical EFB installations

For the A380 and the A350, operations have been entirely based on the EFB since the first day of operations, providing the necessary information to the flight crew. The A350 and A380 have a laptop receiver, with a dedicated screen and interfaces to use the laptop.

Over the past years, Airbus has continuously enhanced the operational documentation (Flight Crew Operating Manual (FCOM), QRH, MMEL, …) for the A320/A330/A340 Family aircraft and has adapted the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to EFB-based operations.

As a result, most operators have now successfully introduced the EFB on board the A320/A330/A340 Family fleet, with all the following advantages:

Optimised aircraft performance determination

Easy and efficient documentation management and consultation, with latest technology

Reduced environmental impact due to flight optimisation and suppression of paper

As an intermediate step, at the end of 2020, Airbus removed all paper-based information, performance tables, graphs, and associated information from the Flight Crew Operating Manual (FCOM).

As a final step at the end of 2021, to fully establish EFB-based operations as standard on A320/A330/A340 Family aircraft, Airbus will review the QRH and MMEL to remove information associated with paper-based operations. In this way all the performance tables, as well as associated procedures for both normal and abnormal situations, will be removed.

End 2020: Performance paper-based information removed from FCOM

End 2021: Performance paper-based information removed from QRH and MMEL.

Advantages of EFB

Optimisation aircraft performance:

Using performance software to compute aircraft performance is easier for pilots and enables quicker and more accurate results. It also provides performance with less conservatism for all flight phases. This allows for increased payload, increased FLEX temperatures and more accurate prediction, making the operation more efficient.

Documentation administration:

The use of digital data provides the following benefits:

- When associated with a well-defined and efficient EFB administration process, the use of EFB increases flight safety by reducing the risk of performance calculation errors.

- It avoids printing, manually updating and carrying paper manuals. This enables a faster and easier documentation update process.

- Enriched documentation with colours, hyperlinks and interactivity makes it easier and more efficient to use.

Generational aspect:

More and more pilots are part of the digital native generation. They are used to manipulating smartphones and tablets from an early age. Along their learning path they will study and will be trained on light aircraft that are more and more connected and more and more equipped with integrated avionics. Having an EFB on board their commercial aircraft when starting their career will no longer be an option but standard for operating an aircraft.

Finally, as a global result, performance optimisation and less paper on board reduce the environmental footprint of aircraft operations, one of the most important challenges to consider for the 21st century.

Working with operators and authorities

To help airlines implement EFB as standard operations, Airbus and Navblue* specialists have been providing support to both National Aviation Authorities (NAA) for approval, and to operators for setting up their EFB operation. Airbus is also involved in industry and NAA initiatives for rule-making and regulation preparation.

A little history on the digital story of Airbus cockpits

Since the early years of Airbus history, innovation has always been part of Airbus DNA. In the 1990s with the democratisation of personal computers, Airbus rapidly identified the opportunity offered by such devices to enhance flight operations and safety. It was becoming obvious that future cockpits would be paperless, given the powerful computation capacity of personal computers. With this paperless cockpit objective and supported by the worldwide growing environmental concerns, Airbus developed tools to reduce the use of paper on board.

EFB is not a recent story. It started in the nineties with the first performance computation application, the LPC: Less Paper in the Cockpit. The second major step was the A380, where EFB became standard and, by design, there is a dedicated screen on board to display the EFB information. From 2010, tablets and their flexibility challenged the laptops. Performance computation application became easily accessible. In 2015, with the A350, EFB was confirmed as the new standard for operations, with the portable EFB becoming the standard. In the meantime, more and more airlines were adopting EFB in their operations, moving away from paper.

In 2017, Airbus decided to upgrade its operating standard and developed the electronic QRH (eQRH). Since then, the whole field of flight operations has been supported by a software solution.

Looking forward

The concept of Electronic Flight Bag is now part of the aircraft operation. EFB contains four main categories of information, each stored in separate applications: performance data, charts, mission information and documentation.

Airbus and its subsidiary Navblue are working on continuously enhancing the product in order to allow easier and smoother operation beyond management of documentation and computation of aircraft performance. Already today, thanks to wifi and 3G/4G, the EFB on-ground connectivity enables securely upload onto the EFB, the mission data such as computerised flight plan and weather . Where available, wi-fi connectivity allows the EFB to be used in flight for real time updates. And future connectivity between the EFB and avionics bay is being developed under a project called ‘Connected FMS’ (Flight Management System). Of course, as for all software development managed by Airbus, and moreover when connectivity with avionics is involved, security concerns are addressed at each stage of the development. The dedicated Airbus department, Aircraft Security, develops solutions to provide all the necessary levels of security.

The next project phase anticipates that as more information is digitised, the offering of apps will increase. To enhance the EFB, ‘Mission+’ will be available within a year, fully integrating all the apps, providing an automated assistant for pilots in the dynamic environment of the cockpit to provide a seamless experience and save valuable time.

Finally at a future stage, Airbus considers transitioning from the EFB as we know it today to an electronic flight assistant for missions that will be fully connected with ground and FMS with the final objective of assisting pilots in their daily work, while enhancing efficiency and safety.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9992424249649048}",neutral,0.9992424249649048,0
20 Questions With Airbus Asia-Pacific President and UVA Darden Alumnus Anand Stanley - The Darden Report,"Mon, 01 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5kYXJkZW4udmlyZ2luaWEuZWR1LzIwMjEvMDIvMDEvYW5hbmQtc3RhbmxleS1haXJidXMtYXNpYS1wYWNpZmljL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Melissa Castro

University of Virginia Darden School of Business alumnus Anand Stanley (MBA ‘03) was appointed in July 2020 to run all of Airbus’ Asia-Pacific operations and business lines, including civil and military aircraft, helicopters, and satellite operations. He leads 4,000 employees and 20,000 subcontractors, and his region represents a quarter of Airbus’ global operations.

Stanley, who is based in Singapore, says the pandemic has forced him to become a bit of an “amateur virologist” as he has worked with governments, business leaders, suppliers and others to design approaches that balance safety and economics.

Prior to Airbus, he spent much of his career at United Technologies after a Darden grad hired him as a summer intern. Now, the former Darden social chair has changed seats to chair multiple industry advocacy organizations that represent the interests of the aerospace industry.

1. What was your first job?

I was a part-time nightclub and radio DJ.

2. What is the best piece of advice you have ever received?

To make your hobby your job.

3. Whom do you most admire?

My dad was an orphan from a small town in India and rose up to lead 250,000 employees in the Indian government. He taught me that you can be anything you want to be if you believe in yourself and you are willing to persevere.

4. What motivates you?

Crisis situations motivate me. Today, I’m really motivated to get planes back in the air and help my airline customers. I’m also preoccupied with helping governments reopen borders for air travel.

5. When and where do you do your best thinking?

My wife is my best friend and coach. So I get my best clarity when I debate ideas with her over a glass of wine or relaxing next to a pool.

6. What are you reading these days?

History inspires me. I have a few books I’m reading; for instance, Singapore — A Biography. The stories about explorers who risked everything give me inspiration for my own ventures.

7. What technology can you not live without?

I’m addicted to my iPhone. It’s my one-stop shop. I kind of wish I could live without it so I could be free for a bit.

8. What’s your motto?

I believe in the old Silicon Valley motto: “Test fast, fail fast, adjust fast.”

9. How do you deal with conflict?

I have been categorized as “leaning toward” conflict-seeking, because I think tension makes us better. Healthy conflict creates a sense of urgency, decisiveness and action.

10. What is your superpower?

I don’t have one; I’m just a mere mortal. My wife is Superwoman.

11. How do you unwind?

I enjoy unwinding with my kids, whether it is scouting, snorkeling, eating street food or the guilty pleasure of playing video games.

12. What is your favorite cause?

The plight of refugees and the displaced really moves me and my family. When we were living in Turkey, through our church, we provided about 10,000 blankets and shelter and food for Syrian refugees.

13. If you could live anywhere, where would it be?

It’s been a self-fulfilling curse every time I’ve answered that question. My family loves it here in Singapore, and they’ve already warned me not to move again.

14. What do you lose sleep over?

Sleep was my first love, and we’re inseparable. I can take a nap anywhere. I give 150 percent each day and when I go to bed, I know I’ve done my best and I go to bed peacefully.

15. Which class at Darden impacted you the most?

I enjoyed Sherwood Frey’s “Quantitative Analysis” class the most, and it taught me how to make decisions in the midst of ambiguity, because even the quantitative world is not black and white.

16. What’s your favorite Darden memory?

My wedding, two years after graduation. We had 40 of my Darden classmates, professors and spouses there — my Darden family — and it was one of the most beautiful moments.

17. What have you learned managing Airbus Asia-Pacific through the challenges presented by the coronavirus pandemic?

It’s always a black swan event like COVID-19 that catches people off guard. Darden helped me see the 360-degree view. It’s not about having the answers; it’s about having intuition, awareness, and being agile and decisive enough to move quickly.

18. It’s a challenging time in the airline industry. What are you most optimistic about?

I am very optimistic that we will continue to be a global and connected world, which includes the continued travel and mobility of people. In countries such as India, only 2 percent of the population has ever set foot on a plane, which proves that aviation will continue to grow and it will continue to improve the quality of human life, especially in Asia-Pacific and Africa.

19. What does the future of the passenger aircraft look like? Are there game-changing new models or technology coming down the pipe?

The greatest challenges for aviation today are to reinvent itself in the digital world and to decarbonize the industry to help our planet heal. Airbus is working on concepts to launch a zero-emission hydrogen-powered aircraft.

20. Your career at Airbus recently led you to relocate from India to Singapore, and you worked all over the world prior to Airbus. Why have you pursued a global career?

On a personal note, I love traveling and experiencing new cultures. This led me to work in eight countries across four continents. Cross-cultural experience stretches you and gives you “dog years” of experience. I’ve always been risk-seeking and open to new opportunities, so intergalactic forces just moved me around and things fell in my lap.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998770952224731}",neutral,0.9998770952224731,0
EU mulls new Airbus subsidy model to appease Biden - POLITICO Europe,"Sat, 13 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmV1L2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWJvZWluZy1ldS1uZXctc3Vic2lkeS1tb2RlbC1hcHBlYXNlLWpvZS1iaWRlbi10cmFkZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ironically, this tactic of government cash boosting companies through purchases of warplanes and other military kit at unprovably inflated prices is a ruse that Brussels has long accused the U.S. of exploiting.

For now, the EU is under greater pressure to change its subsidy model than the U.S. because Europe is on the hook as a more extravagant subsidizer. In 2019, the World Trade Organization allowed the U.S. to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion of EU exports to respond to Airbus subsidies — almost double the amount that the EU won in its parallel case against aid for Boeing ($4 billion).

Officials in Madrid, Paris and Berlin told POLITICO they were engaged in tense discussions with the European Commission — the EU's executive body — over how to restructure the aid. Brussels, they said, was preparing to make an offer to U.S. President Joe Biden's administration.

The European subsidy model at the heart of the dispute is called Repayable Launch Investment. Under this scheme, the governments of Germany, France and Spain have granted Airbus loans for developing new aircraft models that the manufacturer only repays if the model becomes a commercial success.

The WTO says this type of aid is not illegal in itself but that European countries used it at excessively generous terms. France, Spain and Airbus came to an arrangement last year they claimed would make their RLI terms WTO-compatible, but the Americans still insist that Europe must ditch the mechanism, diplomats said.

Two European trade officials said that one proposal being discussed with the capitals was indeed to completely phase out RLI, as that would please the Americans.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9992520213127136}",neutral,0.9992520213127136,0
Airbus reveals planes sold in last two years will emit over 1bn tonnes of CO2 - The Guardian,"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxL2ZlYi8yNi9haXJidXMtcmV2ZWFscy1wbGFuZXMtc29sZC1pbi1sYXN0LXR3by15ZWFycy13aWxsLWVtaXQtb3Zlci0xYm4tdG9ubmVzLW9mLWNvMtIBfmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxL2ZlYi8yNi9haXJidXMtcmV2ZWFscy1wbGFuZXMtc29sZC1pbi1sYXN0LXR3by15ZWFycy13aWxsLWVtaXQtb3Zlci0xYm4tdG9ubmVzLW9mLWNvMg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Planes sold by Airbus in 2019 and 2020 will produce well over 1bn tonnes of carbon dioxide during their lifetimes, according to landmark first estimates of the aerospace manufacturer’s emissions.

Airbus sold a record 863 planes in 2019, which would translate to 740m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent produced over a 22-year period, according to figures seen by the Guardian. It sold 566 planes last year, for which lifetime emissions would be 440m tonnes.

The figures highlight the scale of the challenge of decarbonisation for the plane-making duopoly of Airbus and its US rival Boeing. Aviation accounts for about 1.9% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and this share is expected to rise rapidly as more people in poorer nations are able to afford to fly.

The emissions intensity of Airbus products fell from 66.6g of CO 2 equivalent per passenger kilometre in 2019 to 63.5g in 2020. Airbus, which has factories in France, the UK, US and China, said this reflected more efficient planes even as the pandemic caused sales to fall.

Julie Kitcher, a member of Airbus’s executive committee who oversees sustainability and communications, said: “Despite the crisis, we’re accelerating the roadmap to decarbonising aviation.”

She said the disclosures were a worst-case view of potential emissions because sustainable fuels could cut the planes’ true net emissions.

The independently audited disclosures mark the first time Airbus has published an estimate of the carbon emissions its commercial planes will generate. These are part of what are known as scope 3 emissions, as opposed to direct emissions from company machinery (scope 1) or emissions embedded in purchased energy (scope 2).

The scope 3 disclosures come as scrutiny of the company’s emissions by the public, governments and investors increases. They will put pressure on Boeing to reveal its emissions.

Emissions disclosure is seen as an important first step in the long journey towards a net zero economy, but Airbus said it had not yet set a science-based target for cutting its carbon emissions.

The aviation industry has a non-binding target to reach net zero between 2060 and 2065, long after the 2050 deadline that scientists say is required to limit global heating to only 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.

Airbus, Boeing, and engine manufacturers such as the UK’s Rolls-Royce are working on zero-emissions propulsion, as are a crowd of much smaller rivals. Some smaller electric planes are nearing production and Airbus is hoping to launch its first hydrogen-powered planes by 2035. Zero-emissions technology for long-haul flights is far off.

Airbus has reduced its emissions per passenger kilometre by half since 1990 through better aerodynamics, more efficient engines and lighter, stronger materials. However, further cuts in emissions will be more difficult to achieve.

Kitcher acknowledged that Airbus’s plans to cut emissions would depend heavily on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), synthesised kerosene produced from replenishable resources. SAF would still emit similar amounts of CO 2 but would theoretically cause net-zero emissions over its lifecycle.

About half of Airbus’s plan for net zero emissions by 2050 depends on SAF, 42% from new technologies and the rest from more efficient management of planes. Similarly, Boeing has committed to certifying all of its planes for 100% SAF use by 2030, after carrying out test flights.

Andrew Murphy, the aviation director at the campaign group Transport & Environment, welcomed the prospect of better aviation emissions disclosure. He said, however, that non-CO 2 heating effects such as those caused by aircraft contrails should also be reported. Non-CO 2 effects heat the planet more than carbon, according to EU analysis.

He also said SAF was potentially viable but it would take concerted action by governments and industry over the next decade to scale it sustainably to anywhere near the levels required. The slow action meant the aviation industry was likely to rely heavily on carbon offsetting for the next decade, he said.

“The sector is in kind of a bind,” he said. “The only thing the sector can do for the next 10 years is mitigate its growth.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9368212819099426}",neutral,0.9368212819099426,0
Airbus says aviation may not recover until 2025 as it unveils a 1.1 billion euro loss.

The world’s largest planemaker eliminated its dividend for a second straight year and predicted a leveling off in deliveries of its popular commercial jets, the company’s chief executive, Guillaume Faury, said.

“As of today we only expect the market to recover between 2023 and 2025,” Mr. Faury said. “The pace of recovery will depend not only on the pandemic and the rate of vaccinations, but also on the decision of governments, if they choose to tighten pandemic conditions or, as I hope, restore freedom,” he said.

The aircraft manufacturer, based in Toulouse, France, said revenue fell by 29 percent to 49.9 billion euros (about $60 billion). Still, the company is outperforming its rival Boeing, which suffered a $11.9 billion loss in 2020, weighed down by the setbacks from the 737 Max, which was grounded after 346 people were killed in two crashes involving the plane, and delays of the first deliveries of the 777X.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9996647834777832}",negative,0.9996647834777832,-1

The European Service Module (EMS) is the 15,000-kilogram powerplant of NASA’s Orion spacecraft. In addition to propulsion, it provides consumables like oxygen and water, thermal control and electrical power. The production of service modules for the Orion crew spacecraft is part of ESA’s long-term involvement in Artemis, NASA’s push to return humankind to the surface of the moon.

The finalization of the €650 million contract to produce ESM-4 through 6 was announced on Feb. 2 as part of a joint ESA and Airbus briefing. The firm, fixed-price contract brings the total number of ESMs to be built by Airbus to six.

The first ESM to roll off the production line at Airbus’ facility in Bremen, Germany was delivered to NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in November 2018. It is currently undergoing final integration with the Lockheed-Martin-built Orion spacecraft for Artemis 1, an uncrewed test flight slated to be launched later this year to certify the spacecraft and the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket as safe for human spaceflight.

EMS-2, which will be used for Artemis 2, the program’s first crewed mission, is currently in the final stages of production with delivery expected later this year. EMS- 3, which will be used for the Artemis 3 mission that aims to deliver astronauts to the lunar surface for the first time in over 50 years, is in the early stages of integration in Bremen with delivery expected in October 2022.

The three additional Orion service modules are earmarked to be used for Artemis 4 through 6. Two of the three missions will be in support of the construction of the lunar Gateway, a planned space station in orbit around the moon intended to support crewed missions to the lunar surface.

In supplying the service modules for NASA’s Orion spacecraft, ESA continues its arrangement with the United States in exchanging hardware for access to the International Space Station and, in the future, Artemis missions. According to ESA director of human and robotic exploration David Parker, Europe has already secured three seats aboard Orion missions through its participation in Gateway.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999985933303833}",neutral,0.999985933303833,0

Airbus has handed over the first completed cockpit upgrade for UPS Airlines’ fleet of 52 A300-600 Freighters. The aircraft (MSN868), revitalised with state-of-the-art Honeywell cockpit avionics, was redelivered to UPS on 3rd February at Airbus’ U.S. facility in Mobile Alabama following the certification by EASA on 22nd December 2020 and by the FAA on 5th January 2021. This is the first time that such a complex upgrade has been performed on the A300. UPS expects to have the entire fleet converted by peak season of 2022.





A valuable ‘facelift’

The enhancements transform the A300-600 cockpit to confer the maximum operational flexibility and capabilities – bringing it close to current generation of aircraft. Key to achieving this is the advanced new integrated avionics system supplied by Honeywell, which is based on its Primus Epic suite.



The four large 10x8 inch LCD main displays and the new colour multi-function control & display unit (MCDU), which replace several analogue instruments, are the most immediately visible changes to grace the A300-600’s upgraded instrument panel. Other new ‘under the hood’ items include: a new flight management system (FMS); support for a worldwide navigation database; a new multi-mode receiver (MMR) incorporating the latest GPS-based satellite navigation systems; a digital datalink for communications with air traffic control (ATC); a central maintenance computer; and a digital weather radar system with turbulence detection and windshear prediction – among numerous other capabilities.

Additional capabilities

The upgrade also provided the opportunity to integrate several enhanced safety and situational awareness functions. These include the latest Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS), fully integrated traffic collision avoidance (TCAS) functions, a vertical situation display and a new GPS-based instrument approach capability which is a valuable aid for pilots when flying to airports that are not equipped with traditional radio-based ILS equipment.



Commenting on-site at the re-delivery milestone, Allen Fenske, Honeywell’s Senior Platform Director in the Airbus Customer Business Team highlighted some of the benefits which their new integrated systems will bring to UPS’ operation: “Our modern FMS with FANS capability will help give UPS aircraft priority with ATC controllers. And with the integrated MMR – which includes GPS and SBAS capabilities – UPS can fly into either ILS or non-ILS airports, and it also helps them to land in inclement weather.

Higher maintainability

From an architectural standpoint, the upgrade brings additional simplicity such that if a particular function needs to be upgraded or changed, then in most cases this only requires a circuit board to be quickly swapped-out from a central cabinet – rather than (as previously) having to remove all the other associated hardware. Overall, the upgrade will enable UPS to reliably operate and maintain the type until around 2035, and for these PW4000-powered A300-600Fs to seamlessly take advantage of current and future airspace requirements and evolving ATM infrastructures.



Fenske adds: “We have also modernised the maintenance system enabling UPS to download data from the aircraft wirelessly. This facilitates quick turnaround times. The new worldwide database can be updated in 10 minutes, compared to the tedious original system requiring manual load of several floppy discs of regional-only databases.”

Still young...and perfect for the job!

Ed Walton, Managing Director of Engineering at UPS Airlines said on the day of the handover: “These airplanes that we bought brand new from Airbus are still our babies. They are still young in terms of flight cycles, and therefore have a lot of useful life ahead of them. The A300 design has the perfect capacity for the U.S. domestic ‘express’ market; it’s a great airplane in terms of how it fits into our network. In terms of the overall strategy, the Airbus cockpit upgrade with the Honeywell avionics really allows us to continue using an asset and unlocking the most efficient operational capability.”



Walton notes: “It’s a beautiful airframe for us and it’s still a very efficient freighter. And for the pilots it greatly improves their situational awareness; while for the aircraft maintenance crew we have now transformed this airplane into the modern realm with its central maintenance computer which allows them much quicker troubleshooting.”

Airbus: Service provider and integrator

The retrofit programme commenced with Airbus being chosen to design the new integrated cockpit architecture for UPS’ A300s, and to manage the overall development project including flight-testing and certification. Airbus would also supply the service bulletins and kits to UPS, comprising both the new Honeywell avionics modules as well as Airbus’ own aircraft-specific wiring, cockpit panels and other structural elements. Also worth noting is that being the Type Certificate holder, Airbus provides the warranty and updated documentation with the upgrade.



Olivier Criou, VP Head of the A300/A310 Programme, and Chief Engineer, commented in Mobile: “I am proud that after 50 years since the launch of the A300 programme, the aircraft undergoes a fantastic refresh and reaches state-of-the-art functionality for UPS’ operation. Nevertheless, 50 years in aviation still makes us a relatively young company, and that pioneering spirit still inhabits the A300/A310 team and Airbus as a whole.”





Successful tripartite collaboration ensuring truly efficient long term usage

“It’s been a three and a half year journey,” recalls Honeywell’s Fenske. “I feel that with the Honeywell, Airbus and UPS teams we were very tight knit and collaborative. And with this delivery I can just imagine how excited UPS’ pilots are going to be. They have been flying in the original cockpit, and now they have our modern Primus Epic system with larger colour LCD displays, providing more information better integrated with room to adapt to the continually changing environment, (mandates and future capabilities).”



Airbus’ Criou concludes: “As a company, Airbus has always been committed to providing long-term support to our customers and this is true for our customer UPS and their A300-600F fleet. So we are honoured to have collaborated with them and with our supplier Honeywell, as well as what we have been able to achieve with the teams in Airbus. By answering UPS’ request for a new cockpit, even 13 years after the end of production for this programme, we are still there as their long-term Services Support partner to ensure their aircraft’s future operations.”

A flying laboratory for future technologies - Airbus,"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLTAyLWEtZmx5aW5nLWxhYm9yYXRvcnktZm9yLWZ1dHVyZS10ZWNobm9sb2dpZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Flight testing is a critical step to analysing the maturity and measuring the performance of future aircraft technologies. Through its flight test platforms, Airbus Flightlab puts these technologies to the test. Today, the Flightlab team is focused on expanding its ecosystem to offer even more flight test platforms—including those from commercial aircraft and helicopters.

In a hangar in Colomiers, France—about 12 kilometres west of Toulouse—an A350 is slowly but surely being transformed. Along the air inlet, multiple optical fibres have been installed. An on-board system, capable of carrying out in-flight measurement of engine emissions, is being prepared for activation. And a variety of sensors, from Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) to optical ice detectors, has been placed on board.

All of these modifications prove this particular A350 is not like the others seen on today’s runways: in fact, it is an Airbus test aircraft.

“You can’t test tomorrow’s aircraft technologies on today’s in-service aircraft,” explains Thierry Fol, Cross-Divisional Airbus Flightlab Leader. “And advanced modelling is not enough to deliver proof of concept either. We need flight testing in a real-world environment.”

The Airbus Helicopters Flightlab is a flying laboratory exclusively dedicated to maturing new technologies

Airbus Flightlab provides an invaluable service to Airbus and the aviation industry at large: we help deliver proof of concept for tomorrow’s technologies much more quickly.

- Thierry Fol, Cross-Divisional Airbus Flightlab Leader

This is where Airbus Flightlab comes in. In the more than ten years since its launch, the Airbus Flightlab has put many future aircraft technologies to the test. In particular, the BLADE demonstrator tested the world’s first laminar wing on an A340 test aircraft with the aim of bringing a 50% reduction in wing friction and up to 5% fewer CO2 emissions. In addition, an electric flight test demonstrator (e-FTD) evaluated the performance of an electrical air conditioning system, which helped pave the way to further electrification in aircraft.

Given these successes, the Airbus Flightlab, in close cooperation with Airbus UpNext, has now set its sights on testing even more disruptive technologies in an effort to accelerate their market development.

A testbed for tomorrow’s flight technologies

Airbus Flightlab is essentially a network of flight test platforms that serve as flight demonstrators. These “flying laboratories” are Airbus test aircraft or helicopters, such as an A320 or A350, that are modified to make it possible to test aircraft technologies that have yet to be commercialised.

“Airbus Flightlab provides an invaluable service to Airbus and the aviation industry at large: we help deliver proof of concept for tomorrow’s technologies much more quickly,” Thierry explains. “This means the latest advances in critical areas, such as emissions reduction and smart monitoring, can potentially get to market faster than ever.”

Indeed, four main objectives are at the heart of Flightlab’s mission:

Reducing emissions: Emissions monitoring, sound level measurement and fuel-reduction technologies could help to significantly improve the environmental performance of future aircraft and helicopters.

Improving the piloting experience: Video data capturing, dissimilar sensing and other autonomous technologies could help optimise pilot workload and overall operations, increase system performance and enhance safety.

Increasing connectivity: 4G/5G aircraft connectivity, airborne laser communications and wireless wearable sensor technologies could help improve the passenger experience while ushering in a new era of smart aircraft.

Fostering trust in air travel: In the context of COVID-19, cabin sanitisation technologies could help develop more efficient and smarter disinfection techniques, thereby offering passengers more peace of mind.

The future is Flightlab-friendly

Recently, the Flightlab ecosystem expanded to welcome Airbus Helicopters into the fold. Launched in 2020, the Airbus Helicopters flight test platform is focused on testing cutting-edge technologies in hybrid and electric propulsion, autonomy and emissions reduction. Current flight tests involve measuring helicopter sound levels in urban areas, the results of which will inform Urban Air Mobility initiatives, and assessing the performance of an engine back-up system that would provide emergency electric power in the event of a turbine failure.

Furthermore, the Flightlab team is currently exploring the launch of a flight test platform dedicated to flight-testing technologies from Airbus Defence and Space.

“Very early on, we realised the concept of a flying laboratory to test future technologies developed at Airbus had enormous potential across the entire scope of Airbus’ business lines,” Thierry says. “We’re thrilled the team is making great progress in growing our Flightlab ecosystem.”

Net cash position at € 4.3 billion

2021 guidance issued

Amsterdam, 18 February 2021 – Airbus SE (stock exchange symbol: AIR) reported consolidated Full-Year (FY) 2020 financial results and provided guidance for 2021.

“The 2020 results demonstrate the resilience of Airbus in the most challenging crisis to hit the aerospace industry. I want to thank our teams for their great achievements in 2020 and acknowledge the strong support of our Helicopters and Defence and Space businesses. I would also like to thank our customers, suppliers and partners for their loyalty to Airbus,” said Airbus Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury. “Many uncertainties remain for our industry in 2021 as the pandemic continues to impact lives, economies and societies. We have issued guidance to provide some visibility in a volatile environment. Over the longer term, our ambition is to lead the development of a sustainable global aerospace industry.”

Net commercial aircraft orders totalled 268 (2019: 768 aircraft) with the order backlog comprising 7,184 commercial aircraft as of 31 December 2020. Airbus Helicopters booked 268 net orders (2019: 310 units), including 31 NH90s for the German Bundeswehr in Q4 and 11 H160s. Airbus Defence and Space’s order intake by value increased 39% year-on-year to € 11.9 billion, a book-to-bill above one, mainly driven by major contract wins in Military Aircraft. This included a contract signed in November to deliver 38 new Eurofighters for the German Air Force.



Consolidated order intake by value decreased to € 33.3 billion (2019: € 81.2 billion) with the consolidated order book valued at € 373 billion on 31 December 2020 (year-end 2019: € 471 billion). The decrease in the value of the commercial aircraft backlog reflects the higher number of deliveries compared to order intake, the weakening of the US dollar and an assessment of the backlog’s recoverability.



Consolidated revenues decreased to € 49.9 billion (2019: € 70.5 billion), driven by the difficult market environment impacting the commercial aircraft business with 34% fewer deliveries year-on-year. A total of 566 commercial aircraft were delivered (2019: 863 aircraft), comprising 38 A220s, 446 A320 Family, 19 A330s, 59 A350s and 4 A380s. During the fourth quarter of 2020, a total of 225 commercial aircraft were delivered including 89 in December. In 2020, Airbus Helicopters delivered 300 units (2019: 332 units) with revenues increasing by around 4%, benefiting from a favourable product mix and growth in services. Revenues at Airbus Defence and Space decreased by around 4%, mainly reflecting lower volume as well as the impact of COVID-19 on business phasing, mainly in Space Systems.



Consolidated EBIT Adjusted – an alternative performance measure and key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses – totalled € 1,706 million (2019: € 6,946 million). This mainly reflects the weaker commercial aircraft performance, which was supported by a strong contribution from Airbus Helicopters and Airbus Defence and Space.



Airbus’ EBIT Adjusted of € 618 million (2019: € 5,947 million(1)) mainly reflects the reduced commercial aircraft deliveries and associated lower cost efficiency. It also includes € -1.1 billion in COVID-19 related charges. In January 2021, an update on production rates was communicated in response to the market environment with rates to remain lower for longer.



Airbus Helicopters’ EBIT Adjusted increased to € 471 million (2019: € 422 million), mainly driven by strong government-related activities and reliable programme execution. It also includes lower Research & Development (R&D) expenses reflecting the end of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification process for the five-bladed H145 and the H160.



EBIT Adjusted at Airbus Defence and Space increased to € 660 million (2019: € 565 million), mainly reflecting cost containment measures and lower R&D expenses, partly offset by the impact of COVID-19, including on the launcher business.



A total of 9 A400M military airlifters were delivered during the year, with Belgium taking delivery of its first of seven aircraft in December. Good progress was made with the aircraft’s capability roadmap, including the flight test campaign for Automatic Low Level Flight certification.



Consolidated self-financed R&D expenses decreased to € 2,858 million (2019: € 3,358 million).



Consolidated EBIT (reported) was € -510 million (2019: € 1,339 million), including Adjustments totalling a net € -2,216 million.



These Adjustments comprised:

€ -1,202 million related to the Company-wide restructuring plan;

€ -385 million related to A380 programme cost, of which € -27 million were in Q4;

€ -480 million related to the dollar pre-delivery payment mismatch and balance sheet revaluation, of which € -106 million were in Q4;

€ -149 million of other costs (including compliance), of which € -21 million were in Q4.

The consolidated net loss (2) was € -1,133 million (2019 net loss: € -1,362 million). It includes the financial result of € -620 million (2019: € -275 million). The financial result largely reflects interest results of € -271 million, Repayable Launch Investment re-measurement impact in the other financial result of € -157 million, as well as a net € -149 million related to Dassault Aviation financial instruments. It also includes the impairment of the OneWeb loan, recognised in Q1 2020. The consolidated reported loss per share was € -1.45 (2019: € -1.75).

Consolidated free cash flow before M&A and customer financing amounted to € -6,935 million (2019: € 3,509 million), including the payment of the compliance-related penalties of € -3.6 billion in Q1 2020. The Q4 2020 free cash flow before M&A and customer financing of € 4.9 billion reflects the solid level of aircraft deliveries in the quarter, the good performance from Helicopters and Defence and Space, as well as a strong focus on working capital management.



Various measures were taken during 2020 to maintain a strong liquidity position while navigating the COVID-19 crisis, including a new € 15.0 billion credit facility. Thanks to its strong credit rating, the Company was able to limit interest expenses to € 0.4 billion for the year and extend the maturities of funding sources by issuing new bonds.



Full-year capital expenditure was around € 1.8 billion, down by about € 0.6 billion year-on-year following the prioritisation of projects. Consolidated free cash flow was € -7,362 million (2019: € 3,475 million). The consolidated net cash position was € 4.3 billion on 31 December 2020 (year-end 2019: € 12.5 billion) with a gross cash position of € 21.4 billion (year-end 2019: € 22.7 billion).

Given the global business environment, there will be no dividend proposed for 2020. This decision aims at strengthening the Company’s financial resilience by protecting the net cash position and supporting its ability to adapt as the situation evolves.

Outlook

As the basis for its 2021 guidance, the Company assumes no further disruptions to the world economy, air traffic, the Company’s internal operations, and its ability to deliver products and services. The Company’s 2021 guidance is before M&A.

On that basis, the Company targets to at least achieve in 2021:

Same number of commercial aircraft deliveries as in 2020;

EBIT Adjusted of € 2 billion;

Breakeven free cash flow before M&A and customer financing.

KPI DEFINITION EBIT The Company continues to use the term EBIT (Earnings before interest and taxes). It is identical to Profit before finance result and income taxes as defined by IFRS Rules. Adjustment Adjustment, an alternative performance measure, is a term used by the Company which includes material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses. EBIT Adjusted The Company uses an alternative performance measure, EBIT Adjusted, as a key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses. EPS Adjusted EPS Adjusted is an alternative performance measure of basic earnings per share as reported whereby the net income as the numerator does include Adjustments. For reconciliation, see the Analyst presentation. Gross cash position The Company defines its consolidated gross cash position as the sum of (i) cash and cash equivalents and (ii) securities (all as recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position). Net cash position For the definition of the alternative performance measure net cash position, see the Universal Registration Document, MD&A section 2.1.6. FCF For the definition of the alternative performance measure free cash flow, see the Universal Registration Document, MD&A section 2.1.6.1. It is a key indicator which allows the Company to measure the amount of cash flow generated from operations after cash used in investing activities. FCF before M&A Free cash flow before mergers and acquisitions refers to free cash flow as defined in the Universal Registration Document, MD&A section 2.1.6.1 adjusted for net proceeds from disposals and acquisitions. It is an alternative performance measure and key indicator that reflects free cash flow excluding those cash flows resulting from acquisitions and disposals of businesses. FCF before M&A and customer financing Free cash flow before M&A and customer financing refers to free cash flow before mergers and acquisitions adjusted for cash flow related to aircraft financing activities. It is an alternative performance measure and indicator that may be used occasionally by the Company in its financial guidance, especially when there is higher uncertainty around customer financing activities.

COVID-19 vaccines in remote locations: Airbus helicopters rise to the challenge - Airbus,"Mon, 01 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLTAyLWNvdmlkLTE5LXZhY2NpbmVzLWluLXJlbW90ZS1sb2NhdGlvbnMtYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLXJpc2UtdG8tdGhl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The speed and extraordinary ability of helicopters to reach remote locations make them an essential component for accomplishing the last leg of the logistical challenge involved in distributing COVID-19 vaccines to isolated areas.

Today, more than 30 countries are engaged in mass vaccination campaigns to protect populations against the coronavirus, with Airbus-built rotorcraft providing vital airlift services in locations around the world. Many Airbus helicopter types are being deployed by military services, government agencies and civil operators – from the single-engine, H125 light utility version to the twin-engine heavy-lift H225M.

Chile: Civil and military helicopters for a common goal

Since the end of 2020, Chilean authorities have been deploying helicopters and aircraft to distribute Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines in different regions of the country. This airlift includes a BK117 from the Prefectura Aérea de Carabineros and a Chilean Navy AS365 Panther.

The H125 offers many benefits for getting vaccines to remote and high-altitude locations.

Additionally, a Suma Air H125 transported 85 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine from Santiago to Quillota Hospital. “The helicopter is an excellent alternative to transferring vaccines in optimal conditions – providing a fast, timely and efficient way to reach locations that would be difficult to access without the proper means of transportation,” explained José Luis Bendicho, General Manager of Suma Air. “The H125 offers many benefits for getting vaccines to remote and high-altitude locations.”

Brazil: A challenge across more than 8.5 million square kilometres

In Brazil, helicopters of the armed forces and public security bodies are working together in dispatching vaccines across the country’s different states. Distribution is carried out centrally: the government receives the vaccines and passes them along for the states to administer. The country has a large and efficient vaccination network, with extensive experience gained through annual vaccination campaigns.

In Minas Gerais, the local fire brigade’s two H125 helicopters and one fixed-wing aircraft have been tasked with distributing 560,000 vaccine doses in the state. Public security H125s also were in charge of transporting a share of the 70,000 doses in the state of Alagoas, while in the state of Ceará, it was the H145 of CIOPAer (a unit specialised in the use of helicopters for major public security operations) that was tasked for vaccine deliveries to the most remote areas.

Mexico: The H225M and Panther on duty

After the first large shipment of vaccines arrived in Mexico, the government launched a coordinated dispersal plan with the establishment of eight air routes for the distribution of approximately 440,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines.

The Secretariat of National Defense (SEDENA) deployed eight aircraft, including an H225M helicopter and three Airbus-built C295 fixed-wing aircraft, to deliver shipments across 25 states in southern, central and northwestern Mexico in less than 24 hours. The country’s navy also has been using a Panther AS565 MB helicopter to carry 200 vaccine doses from Hermosillo to Puerto Peñasco.

Spain and France: Island and coastal delivery

In Spain, the armed forces have taken charge of dispatching vaccines via air from Getafe (near Madrid) to the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, along with the Spanish autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla on Africa’s north coast. For Ceuta, the chosen transportation method was a Spanish Army H215M Cougar that transported the vaccines in containers with dry ice to keep them at -76º Celsius.

Beginning in late January, the helicopter fleet of France’s Securité Civile government agency began transporting vaccines to the Brittany Islands (Groix, Houat, Hoedic, etc.) off the coast of western France. During the initial operations, teams managed to vaccinate 77 people on the Île d’Arz, followed by the helicopter delivery of 100 doses to the Hoedic and Houat islands.

Transporting ultra-cold vaccines aboard aircraft

The transportation of vaccines requires storage temperatures between +2 and -70 degrees Celsius, depending on the ingredients used for their immunisation technology. Dry ice – the frozen form of CO2 – enables their shipment at -70 degrees Celsius, which is necessary for RNA-based vaccines when they will not be used within a few days.

Helicopters are the last leg in the chain of transportation and often deliver vaccines that are administered to patients within a few days. For this reason, they are not usually called upon to transport vaccines that require ultra-cold temperatures. However, they have been on occasion, and are up to the challenge when necessary.

As dry ice is considered hazardous due to the potential of excessive CO2 is concentration, the airlift of cold-storage COVID-19 vaccines aboard helicopters follows the same rules as in the transport of dangerous goods on airplanes – and requires additional precautionary measures from operators.

Airbus Commercial Aircraft has issued an information pack for operators that includes an updated “Service Information Letter” (SIL) with the company’s input on airworthiness authorities’ recommendations for transporting dry ice in larger quantities. It reminds operators of the health and safety considerations/measures (particularly regarding ventilation) to be respected during the loading and airlift of vaccines packed in dry ice. In particular, the information includes guidance on limits for amounts of dry ice in accordance with regulations.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8499106764793396}",neutral,0.8499106764793396,0
Airbus space technology reaches Mars - Airbus,"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0wMi1haXJidXMtc3BhY2UtdGVjaG5vbG9neS1yZWFjaGVzLW1hcnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NASA's Perseverance rover relies on Airbus built weather station and communications antenna

Madrid, 16 February 2021 – When NASA's Perseverance rover lands on the surface of the Red Planet next Thursday, key Airbus technology will be on board: the MEDA meteorological station will provide scientists with valuable Mars weather data and the High Gain Antenna System will ensure a high-speed comms link with Earth for the duration of the MARS2020 mission.

Perseverance will use seven scientific instruments to study the Martian biological and geological environment, including the MEDA (Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyser) meteorological station, designed and built by Airbus.

The MEDA instrument will measure many environmental parameters using sensors distributed across the rover: wind speed and direction, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, soil and air temperatures, solar radiation and also properties of suspended dust. These parameters will also be key when making the autonomous decision to release the Ingenuity helicopter on board the rover.

MEDA is the third Martian environmental station led by Airbus demonstrating its expertise in this field. The first was on board the Curiosity rover in 2012, known as REMS (Rover Environmental Monitoring Station), and the second on InSight in 2018, called TWINS (Temperature and Wind for InSight). Both were successful NASA / JPL missions.

All data from Perseverance’s discoveries will be sent to Earth through the high gain antenna system (HGAS) also designed and built by Airbus, based on an X-band transmitting and receiving antenna that will allow high speed data communications. The antenna is based on microstrip technology, developed in-house. It is protected from dust, to maintain clean conditions and thermal stability.

The antenna will directly send scientific data generated by the different instruments and information on the health status of the rover, without the need for intermediate links (e.g. orbiters). In addition, the vehicle will receive daily instructions from Earth with the tasks of the day. As the antenna is steerable, it can send a “beam” of information pointing directly at the Earth without moving the vehicle, which contributes to energy savings.

The extreme thermal excursions on Mars required qualification of the antenna system at temperatures ranging from -135ºC to + 90ºC with exhaustive thermal fatigue tests. This will be Airbus' second HGAS antenna system on Mars, with the first still operating flawlessly on board Curiosity eight years later.

Mars2020 is the most ambitious mission ever sent to Mars as it will examine Martian rock and soil in greater detail than ever before in search of evidence of past life on the planet and store, for their subsequent return to Earth, signs or traces of past life (bio-signatures). Likewise, it will characterise the geological processes that make up the surface, and will measure the daily and seasonal evolution of the processes occurring in the Martian atmosphere, including the characterisation of suspended dust. Perseverance will also test technologies to help pave the way for future human exploration of Mars, such as generating oxygen from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere or the first flight of a small helicopter on another planet.

Large-scale 3D printing goes to space on Airbus' Eurostar Neo satellites - Airbus,"Tue, 09 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLTAyLWxhcmdlLXNjYWxlLTNkLXByaW50aW5nLWdvZXMtdG8tc3BhY2Utb24tYWlyYnVzLWV1cm9zdGFyLW5lby1zYXRlbGxpdGVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Radio frequency components are at the heart of every telecommunications satellite, and such parts are now being produced by Airbus in large volumes with innovative Additive Layer Manufacturing (ALM) technology – also known as 3D printing – for its latest spacecraft: the Eurostar Neo-series relay platform.

A total of 500 radio frequency (RF) components, composed of multi-waveguide blocks and switch assembly networks, have been 3D manufactured by Airbus Defence and Space in Portsmouth, UK for two Eurostar Neo spacecraft that will join the in-orbit fleet of Eutelsat, a major provider of satellite communications services.

Efficient production using ALM

These two satellites are called EUTELSAT HOTBIRD 13F and 13G. They will reinforce and enhance Eutelsat’s TV broadcasting services over Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa.

Using 3D printing for the EUTELSAT HOTBIRD satellites provides major labour savings during assembly enabling our teams to focus on more value-added tasks, as well as a significant reduction in the number of individual parts.

This is recognised as the first large-scale deployment of RF products using the ALM process, and it puts us in an industry-leading position for the technology’s application in producing radio frequency components.

- Gareth Penlington, HOTBIRD Payload Manager

Airbus’ manufacturing team in Portsmouth developed innovative designs for the Eurostar Neo’s multi-waveguide blocks and switch assembly networks to be 3D printed, taking them from initial concept and patenting through industrialisation and the completion of a successful qualification programme.

“This is recognised as the first large-scale deployment of RF products using the ALM process, and it puts us in an industry-leading position for the technology’s application in producing radio frequency components,” Penlington said.

The no. 1 EUTELSAT HOTBIRD satellite’s communications module was transferred earlier this month from Portsmouth to the Airbus Defence and Space facility in Toulouse, France, where the spacecraft’s full build-up will be completed. Assembly of the second HOTBIRD communications module is now underway in Portsmouth, with its testing to begin in February.

Q&A

Is it correct that all 500 additively manufactured components are also all integrated into the satellites (i.e. around 250 per satellite)?

Yes – there are number of different components and designs on both spacecraft.

What do the components look like and how big are they – size, weight, etc?

There are more than 100 different waveguide designs along with other network designs. (Waveguides route the RF signals around the spacecraft.) The size of the components range in size from about 300mm to about 100mm.

What additive manufacturing technology (e.g. selective laser melting) and what material were the individual components made of?

Material is aluminium silicon magnesium (AlSi10Mg) and yes uses SLM selective laser melting

What were the particular challenges of additive manufacturing compared to conventional manufacturing?

Waveguides need to have a smooth surface to achieve the required RF performance, and the ALM components require post processing to achieve this.

Can the advantages of additively manufactured components also be quantified?

We have achieved considerable schedule reductions over existing conventional waveguides. On average we have halved the production time of wave guides using ALM.

Approximately how long is the development time until an additively manufactured satellite component flies into space?

Initial work on ALM components to first took just over two years, but now that processes have been industrialised it is only a matter of months.

Does Airbus manufacture these components itself or via service providers and how is quality assurance and certification carried out here (possibly analogous to the TRLs on aircraft construction)?

We used third party suppliers who underwent full supplier and qualification processes.

Who decides which components in the satellite are additively manufactured (Eutelsat or Airbus) and what criteria are used as a basis?

Decisions are taken by Airbus but always with customer approval. The overall aim is to be improve schedule.

And how do you assess the importance of additive manufacturing currently and in the coming years?

Additive manufacturing is vitally important and the technology is now available as a baseline for the payload customization teams to utilize. We envisage further schedule improvements and reduced cost of manufacture and assembly in the future using this technology. On average an ALM item replaces a part which had five separate components.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998261332511902}",neutral,0.9998261332511902,0

The contract marks the entry into the oil and gas market of the H160 with a wealth of design features promising new levels of safety, comfort and schedule reliability in offshore operations.

The three companies – Airbus, PHI and Shell – are cooperating in a unique partnership. In a pioneering move, Airbus will provide one H160 ahead of final deliveries to PHI and Shell for a year-long route-proving programme to enable the operator and the final customer to familiarize themselves with the type’s advanced features and mitigate the normal challenges around entry into service.

At PHI it will be based at Houma, Louisiana and join a large company fleet of H125s and H135s deployed in emergency medical service throughout the United States, as well as two H145s operating for Shell on pipeline survey work in Louisiana, and two H145s flying the world’s longest harbour pilot shuttle in Mackay, Australia.

Airbus Helicopters Executive Vice President Global Business, Ben Bridge, said: “We greatly appreciate the innovative thinking of our customers in formulating this partnership around the H160 which will begin a new era of safety, reliability and environmental performance in the medium class of offshore operations.”

PHI Aviation Managing Director, Keith Mullett said: “We are proud to be playing a key role in the entry into service of the highly advanced H160 in the offshore sector and we look forward to bringing a step change in operating standards through the confidence building route- proving exercise agreed with our partners Airbus and Shell.”

Shell Aircraft Vice President, Tony Cramp said: “Shell welcomes the opportunity to embrace new aviation technology and introduce this highly advanced and efficient aircraft to safely service our vibrant and growing offshore business in the US Gulf of Mexico.”

Shell General Manager - Supply Chain Deepwater, Viet Van added: “The emissions reductions that the H160 provides help us continue to deliver crude and natural gas with the smallest carbon footprint of our global deepwater portfolio, and are another important step to meeting our goal of zero net emissions by 2050.”

With 68 patents, the H160 is the world’s most technologically advanced helicopter and features an unprecedented suite of pilot aids delivered through its Helionix avionics which substantially reduces crew workload and decreases the risk of pilot error.

They include the world’s first ground helipad assisted take-off procedure, a vortex ring state pre-alerting system and a recovery mode to automatically regain steady flight in difficult circumstances.

The H160 is powered by two of the latest Arrano engines from Safran Helicopter Engines and incorporates an embedded monitoring system and a redundancy of sensors, and can be maintained autonomously far from base. The design emphasises robust corrosion defence specifically envisaging offshore missions.

The planemaker's decision to restore key business targets is the latest evidence of recovery hopes being watched by financial markets following the pandemic, which severely hurt air travel.

Rival Boeing , mired in a separate crisis over the grounding of its 737 MAX that saw Airbus reclaim the title of largest global jetmaker, is not yet giving detailed views.

But analysts expressed concerns that the deliberately cautious delivery forecast from Airbus jarred with the same company's plans to start unwinding cuts in jet production, albeit at a slower pace than initially planned.

""I think the worst is behind us. However, the market is still very volatile especially in the current environment (and) the visibility is low,"" Dominik Asam, chief financial officer of Airbus, told CNBC on Thursday.

""We are to some degree also dependent on the recovery as vaccines are spreading in the second half of the year and for the summer season,"" he added.

Shares in Airbus fell 3.4% in early trading.

Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said the forecast was for ""at least"" 566 deliveries, unchanged from last year when production was 40% below its peak.

This will give investors some visibility in a world in which the pandemic seems to be getting worse in the short term, he said.

The actual level of deliveries will depend on demand from airlines rather than supply chains or funding, he added.

A collapse in demand from carriers worldwide has left almost 100 jets sitting outside Airbus factories, down from a peak of around 145. But any shortfall in deliveries compared to factory production could drive the costly stockpile higher again.

""We remain cautious about the pace at which the airline industry can rebuild its balance sheet to the point where aircraft demand rises significantly,"" Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris wrote.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9999912977218628}",negative,0.9999912977218628,-1

Aerostructures are “a core activity of Airbus,” CEO Guillaume Faury told reporters at the company’s virtual annual press conference Feb. 18.

Airbus carved out several of its German and French sites at the beginning of 2009 with a view of divesting them at some point to focus the group on design, system integration and aircraft final assembly. However, the units were never sold. German subsidiary Premium Aerotec includes sites in Augsburg, Nordenham and Varel. At the same time, what was then called Aerolia was set up in France, comprising factories in Méaulte and Saint Nazaire; Aerolia merged with Sogerma to form Stelia Aerospace in 2015.

“The connection between design and production will be far more important,” Faury said. He was referring both to the ongoing move to Airbus’ digital design manufacturing and services (DDMS) program as well as changing requirements forecast with future aircraft models. Faury predicted that aircraft architecture will change significantly and aerostructures therefore will be “an important part” of that process, which “has to remain in Airbus.”

Boeing divested its Wichita, Kansas-based aerostructures business to form Spirit Aerosystems in 2005.

The decision to keep Premium Aerotec and Stelia inside the group permanently will be an important aspect in Airbus’ efforts to simplify its European industrial base, which Faury highlighted as a priority for the coming years. He left open whether and to what extent reintegration of the two subsidiaries will be pursued. Putting their activities in separate units had helped reduce complexity at the Airbus Group level, but it has led to double structures at the unit levels as the two were aiming at building up their own core functions ahead of possible sales to new investors.

Airbus’ industrial streamlining is planned to go beyond Premium Aerotec and Stelia, however, and includes the manufacturer’s primary sites across Europe. “There is a lot of potential for simplification at the European bases,” Faury said. The process is not expected to lead to the closing of any sites or to further outsourcing to bases outside of Europe such as in China or the U.S.

Faury also made clear that UK plants in Broughton and Filton will remain key to Airbus wing production in the future in spite of the fact that the country is no longer part of the European Union following Brexit.

The efforts for a more efficient internal industrial system that is not based on major divestitures is part of a broader exercise of Airbus to adjust to post-pandemic demand and production rates—a process that Faury described as very challenging, even as far as planning assumptions are concerned.

“I don’t know what being prudent actually means right now,” he said referring to production planning. “The short term is getting worse, the mid- and long term looks better,” he said. “That is a contradiction that is very difficult to manage.”

Nonetheless, Airbus is sticking to its earlier plans to begin a relatively slow ramp-up of single-aisle production, going from 40 aircraft per month to 43 in the third quarter and to 45 in the fourth quarter. “We expect a very backloaded 2021,” he said.

The slow increase in production is also seen as a preparation exercise for a much steeper ramp-up that Airbus still believes is likely in 2022. Faury expects demand to be “much stronger than in 2021” but still short of justifying former peak production rates of 60-plus narrowbodies per month. The Airbus CEO pointed out, however, that the company can boost output very fast because the tooling and infrastructure for much higher rates is already in place with staff levels being the key potential bottleneck for a fast expansion of production.

Airbus still expects a full recovery of air travel demand to pre-crisis levels between 2023 and 2025. Faury was also clear in predicting that the market will “be similar to what it was before the crisis,” though the environmental agenda will be much more important. “Businesses need to fly again; they are eager to restart projects.” Also, “people are impatient to fly again” for holidays and on other private trips.

Demand for widebodies will be lower for longer, Faury conceded. He hinted that Airbus may reduce A330neo production “slightly” below the current two aircraft per month rate, though for now it is not making that decision. The A330neo will be part of the Airbus portfolio “for the long term.” The planned new final assembly line for the A321neo in Toulouse is “on ice” for now but is “likely to be restarted.”

Airbus 2020 revenues dropped 29% to €49.9 billion ($60.2 billion). The company made a €510 million operating loss and a €1.1 billion net loss for the full year. Free cash flow was negative €7.3 billion.

Airbus adjusted the value of its order backlog downwards by €98 billion (to €373 billion). Several factors influenced the move, including the devaluation of the U.S. dollar. Around 10% of the reduction was due to aircraft deferrals and cancellations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the fourth quarter Airbus generated €4.9 billion in cash as it managed to deliver aircraft way above average production rates for the year.

In 2021, the company plans to deliver at least as many commercial aircraft as in 2020 (566). Its adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is expected to reach €2 billion, €300 million higher than this year. And cash-flow before mergers and acquisitions and customer financing will be at least at break-even, according to the outlook. However, CFO Dominik Asam said Airbus may have to finance deliveries of €1 billion or more in 2021, though it is betting on strong support from export credit agencies.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999993085861206}",neutral,0.999993085861206,0
China's jets set to challenge Boeing and Airbus - Asia Times,"Tue, 02 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyL2NoaW5hcy1qZXRzLXNldC10by1jaGFsbGVuZ2UtYm9laW5nLWFuZC1haXJidXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aerospace is one of the key industries targeted by Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” drive. Could this become a problem for Boeing, Airbus and other non-Chinese suppliers of aircraft, aircraft engines and other related equipment?

The outgoing Donald Trump administration apparently thought so. In mid-January, it put Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) on its list of companies tied to the Chinese military.

This prevents Americans from investing in COMAC, although they would probably not do so anyway. COMAC is not publicly traded and has issued bonds only in the Chinese domestic market.

The Pentagon is concerned about China’s “military-civil fusion development strategy” – an alarming business model similar to those of Boeing, Raytheon and other American companies that serve both military and civilian markets.

“Military-Civil Fusion” has even become an American acronym, MCF, raising it to the level of official Washington, DC, claptrap.

As the Center for a New American Security reports, “MCF has emerged as a key analytic driver of the intensifying economic and technological competition between the United States and the PRC in recent years.” (www.cnas.org, Myths and Realities of China’s Military-Civil Fusion Strategy, January 28, 2021)

China’s MCF, however, is “misunderstood,” and its success is “hardly a foregone conclusion.” (ibid.) So is COMAC a threat or not?

COMAC may be added to America’s “Entity List,” meaning its American suppliers would have to receive special licenses from the Commerce Department in order to ship their products to COMAC.

This could be very serious since without key American components COMAC airplanes could not fly. Its American suppliers include engine makers Pratt & Whitney and CFM International (the GE-Safran joint venture), avionics suppliers Honeywell and Rockwell Collins, PPG Aerospace Materials and others.

COMAC was established in 2008 by the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, Aluminum Corporation of China, Baosteel Group Corporation, Shanghai Guosheng Corporation (an investment company) and the state-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC). SASAC has a majority stake in COMAC.

Two on the runway

COMAC is not controlled by the Chinese military but it is an instrument of national policy. As stated on its website: “The Party Committee of SASAC performs the responsibilities mandated by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.”

COMAC now has two products, the ARJ21 regional jet (ARJ stands for Advanced Regional Jet) and the C919 narrow-body (single-aisle) jet aircraft.

The ARJ21 is a 78-90 seat passenger plane with a range of 2,225 to 3,700 kilometers. The first delivery was made in 2015 to Chengdu Airlines, which started commercial flights the following year.

China’s Global Times reports that close to 50 ARJ21s are now in service and that more than 20 were produced last year. According to COMAC’s website: “A total of 616 orders have been obtained from 23 customers.”

The C919 is a 156-168 seat passenger plane with a range of 4,075 to 5,555 kilometers. It is undergoing flight tests now, with the first deliveries – to China Eastern Airlines – scheduled to be made by the end of this year. According to COMAC, “A total of 815 orders have been obtained from 28 customers.”

The ARJ21 competes with regional jets made by Embraer of Brazil, Bombardier of Canada and, if it can ever get its SpaceJet into service, Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation of Japan. The C919 will compete with Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 aircraft.

In 2017, COMAC and United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) of Russia formed the China-Russia Commercial Aircraft International Co, Ltd (CRAIC) to jointly develop a long-range, wide-body aircraft that will be assembled in Shanghai.

This is the CR929, a 280-seat wide-body (dual-aisle) passenger jet with a range of 12,000 kilometers. It is intended to compete with Boeing and Airbus long-haul aircraft, initially in China, Russia and the CIS, and eventually in the global market. Manufacturing is scheduled to start this year.

UAC was established in 2006 through the merger of Russian aircraft manufacturers Ilyushin, Irkut, Mikoyan, Sukhoi, Tupolev and Yakolev. Primarily a defense contractor today, it aspires to become a major supplier of commercial aircraft – as Ilyushin and Tupolev were in Soviet times.

Competitive threat?

Cutting off COMAC is not recommended by Scott Kennedy, Senior Adviser and Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at CSIS (the Center for Strategic & International Studies in Washington), who plays down the competitive threat.

According to Kennedy, “sanctions would hurt the US aerospace industry and ultimately American national security far more than they would harm China.” (csis.org, China’s COMAC: An Aerospace Minor Leaguer, December 7, 2020)

That is because “American companies account for almost three-fifths of the C919’s top suppliers. Almost one-third hail from Europe. Only 14 key suppliers are from China, and seven of those are Chinese-foreign joint ventures.” (ibid.)

As the Biden administration develops a practical response to the Chinese challenge, Kennedy’s view seems likely to prevail.

According to Kennedy, COMAC “isn’t even as capable as its long-time Russian counterparts Ilyushin, Sukhoi, and Tupolev, which have more advanced technology.” (ibid.) But this seems to be missing the point, which is that CRAIC has access to the technology required to build complete commercial aircraft.

In December, UAC began flight tests of the first Russian passenger plane equipped with Russian engines since the collapse of the Soviet Union – a medium-range MC-21 built by Irkut and powered by PD-14 turbofan engines built by United Engine Corporation.

Like UAC, United Engine Corporation is a subsidiary of Rostec, Russia’s State Corporation for Assistance to Development, Production and Export of Advanced Technology Industrial Products. It also makes engines for the Russian military and space program, as well as turbines for power generation.

As reported by Reuters, there are two versions of the MC-21: one powered by engines from Pratt & Whitney, the other by the PD-14. After a two-year delay caused by American economic sanctions, deliveries are expected to begin by the end of this year.

The sanctions forced Irkut to replace imported composite materials with equivalents made in Russia. This reinforces an often-made point that is usually ignored by the US government: sanctions make technically competent targets more competitive.

Market share

This doesn’t mean that China and Russia will take a significant share of the global market for commercial aircraft in the next few years. According to Global Times, a Chinese executive at CRAIC estimates that the CR929 could take 15% of the global market for long-haul passenger aircraft by 2045.

Considering the technological and managerial challenges of efficient mass production, and the history of Airbus, this appears to be a prudent assessment.

Boeing’s Commercial Market Outlook 2020-2039 forecasts that Chinese airlines will need to take delivery of about 8,400 new passenger aircraft in that time frame, nearly 20% of total worldwide demand.

Airbus was founded in 1970 by European governments and corporations in order to achieve the scale required to compete with the Americans. Within a decade, it had taken enough market share from Boeing to spark a dispute with the US over government subsidies. The larger Airbus grew, the more heated the dispute became.

In 2004, the US filed a case against EU subsidies to Airbus with the WTO. The EU retaliated with its own case against US government assistance to Boeing. The litigation continued until 2020, when the WTO ruled that since both parties had violated the rules, they could levy compensatory tariffs on each other.

The two cheaters demonstrated their commitment to high economic principles with a food fight. In addition to taxes on imported aircraft and aircraft parts, the US put tariffs on European wine, cheese and olive oil, while the EU put tariffs on American ketchup, orange juice and sweet potatoes.

After running neck and neck for more than a decade, the fatal Boeing 737 MAX crashes and subsequent groundings made it possible for Airbus to take the leading position in the industry in both 2019 and 2020 – 50 years after it was established.

Last year, with air traffic greatly reduced by Covid-19, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines and Air China postponed the delivery of more than 100 aircraft from Boeing and Airbus while continuing to receive deliveries from COMAC. Smaller Chinese airlines also took deliveries from COMAC.

COMAC delivered 24 ARJ21s in 2020, compared with total deliveries of 157 aircraft for Boeing and 566 for Airbus.

Most likely, the dispute over Chinese subsidies and market access is only beginning. But China and Russia combined are a huge market for passenger aircraft and import substitution alone all but guarantees the long-term viability of COMAC, UAC and CRAIC.

The degree to which Western engine and avionics suppliers will share in the growth of this market will depend on the attitudes of Western governments and the speed at which Chinese and Russian manufacturing capabilities develop.

Airbus reveals carbon footprint of planes amid climate pressure - RFI English,"Sat, 27 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZmkuZnIvZW4vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjEwMjI3LWFpcmJ1cy1yZXZlYWxzLWxpZmV0aW1lLWNhcmJvbi1lbWlzc2lvbnMtb2YtcGxhbmVzLWFtaWQtY2xpbWF0ZS1wcmVzc3VyZS1jbzItZm9vdHByaW50LXN1c3RhaW5hYmxl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Carbon emissions

In an industry first, Airbus has unveiled the lifetime carbon emissions of its aircraft, a move that will help measure the aviation sector's progress towards its goal of reducing carbon emissions.

An Airbus A350 takes off at the aircraft builder's headquarters in Colomiers near Toulouse, France, September 27, 2019.

Airbus executive vice president Julie Kitcher said it was an opportunity to increase transparency in the industry.

""We really want to demonstrate our commitment to driving decarbonisation of the sector,"" she said.

Plane manufacturing represents 2 percent of global CO 2 emissions, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization, but a forecast rise in passenger air traffic means it could add more pollution to the skies unless measures are taken rapidly.

And between the ""flygskam"" movement, a Swedish neologism meaning ""flight shame"", to increasing social responsibility expectations among investors, the industry is under mounting pressure to meet its promise to cut its carbon emissions by half from 2005 levels by 2050.

740 million tonnes of CO 2

Airbus calculated that the 863 planes that it delivered in 2019 will emit 740 million tonnes of CO 2 during an estimated 22 years in service.

As a point of comparison, the whole of France is estimated to have emitted 441 million tonnes of CO 2 in 2019.

Airbus used the accounting measure for emissions used by most leading firms, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, including measuring the use of its products by consumers.

Airbus pointed out, however, that the efficiency of its planes is improving.

It calculated that the planes delivered in 2019 will produce on average 66.6 grams of CO 2 per passenger per kilometre.

In 2020, that figure dropped to 63.5 grams per passenger kilometre.

The current commercial aircraft fleet, including older aircraft, is estimated to emit on average 90 grams per passenger kilometre, according to the NGO International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT).

It estimates that cars produce an average of 122 grams per kilometre, but that figures needs to be divided by the number of passengers in the vehicle to offer a real comparison.

Sustainable fuels

While the information is useful, Airbus's Kitcher pointed out that it only offers a snapshot of the situation today.

That is because the industry is hoping for the development of sustainable aircraft fuels (SAF) made from renewable sources to reduce its emissions.

The predicted carbon dioxide emission levels would drop if the aircraft that Airbus delivered in 2019 are certified to accept up to 50 percent SAF, although the amount of the green fuel available today is extremely low.

""If we had 50 percent of SAF going into our aircraft today we could reduce the emissions of our aircraft flying already by 40 percent,"" Kitcher said.

An increase to 100 percent SAF, the use of hydrogen produced in a renewable manner, or battery powered aircraft could push down emissions even further.

But to reach the 2050 goals, as well as head towards zero emissions, requires a fleet of planes that is 90 percent more efficient than those in 2005 given the expected increase in air travel.

Last year Airbus released three zero-emission concept planes powered by hydrogen that it said could enter service by 2035.

The aviation industry is also counting on better air traffic control and efficiency gains from engines to reduce CO 2 emissions.

Five years on: how the A320neo is changing aviation - Runway Girl Network,"Sat, 27 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvZml2ZS15ZWFycy1vbi1ob3ctdGhlLWEzMjBuZW8taXMtY2hhbmdpbmctYXZpYXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For many who followed the development of Airbus’ A320neo family of aircraft very closely during the first half of the 2010s, it will seem astounding that this aircraft — which feels brand new — entered into service five years ago.

Since then, Airbus has delivered nearly 1700 of the A320neo family across the world, with aircraft operating for full-service airlines, low-cost carriers, all-business outfits, and everyone in between.

The basics of any re-engining, particularly one where the efficiency jump is as substantial as the CFM International LEAP-1A and the Pratt & Whitney PW1000G, are almost self-evident at this point: lower emissions, less fuel, quieter.

But it’s Airbus’ layered, “little bang” strategy of decoupling major airframe changes and working incrementally that has been successful in derisking the evolution of the A320 into the A320neo and the aircraft we know today. Even when elements of change caused delays — and to be sure, some did — there wasn’t an amplifying effect.

Airbus decoupled the sharklets and the reinforced wing they required from the neo step change and its certification, from the Space-Flex galley-lav, from the LR and XLR, from the Cabin Flex doors for the A321neo, from the new FACC bins, from the Airspace cabin for the A320neo family, and so on.

And the aircraft has persuaded the market. The inherent airframe limitations of the Boeing 737 that have hamstrung the MAX — putting aside entirely the scandal around the aircraft’s design and certification — mean that substantially more customers have been convinced by the neo than its competition.

Airbus had roughly two fifths of the market when comparing the Boeing 737NG and the A320ceo, and about a third of the market if the Boeing side included the 737 Classics.

At the time of writing, the 737 MAX has just over 3200 orders when adjusted for the ASC 606 accounting standard. This is likely a relatively hard number following the MAX’s grounding.

Airbus’ number may be softer, but has more than double Boeing’s MAX numbers for the A320neo family, with 3907 A320neos in its order books, of which, at the end of January, it had delivered 1157 of them. Add in the A321neo and its 3466 ordered, of which 469 have been delivered, plus the A319neo as almost a statistical error with just 78 ordered and three delivered.

And that’s also an interesting point about the A320neo. Where some of the A320ceo family’s most iconic operators were A319-heavy — think easyJet, for example — the lack of orders for the A319neo mean that the generational efficiency upgrade is also an upgauge. That upgauge is even more marked with a new generation of economy slimlines like the Geven Essenza and Recaro BL3710 that give similar comfort while allowing an extra row to be added.

Indeed, that upgauge continues throughout the family. A total of 4770 A320ceos were ordered — and all but a couple of dozen delivered as of Airbus’ statistics at the end of January — compared with 1791 A321ceos. But the balance between the medium and large version of the family is much more balanced in the neo generation. For an airframer, that’s particularly helpful to the bottom line: larger aircraft are more expensive, while the incremental costs of building them on the same line are minimal.

With nearly 7500 of the A320neo family on order, despite some likely softness in some of those orders following the COVID-19 crisis, that bottom line is a substantial part of how Airbus will be funding its next generation of aircraft, and indeed its next technological leap, likely into hydrogen. That funding may, after all is said and done, be the way in which the A320neo will most strongly change aviation.

Airbus to Supply 'SMDM' Aliaca fixed-wing UAV to the French Navy - Naval News,"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzAyL2FpcmJ1cy10by1zdXBwbHktc21kbS1hbGlhY2EtZml4ZWQtd2luZy11YXYtdG8tdGhlLWZyZW5jaC1uYXZ5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus to Supply ‘SMDM’ Aliaca fixed-wing UAV to the French Navy Airbus Defence and Space mini UAS subsidiary SURVEY Copter signed a contract with French DGA Armament general directorate to provide the French Navy with 11 systems, (22 aircraft), of the electrically powered fixed-wing Aliaca maritime version UAS (officially called SMDM / “Systèmes de Mini Drones aériens embarqués pour la Marine” by French authorities), including training and integrated logistic support. First deliveries are expected in 2021.

Airbus press release

“We are honored to contribute to the missions of the French Navy which we will support with the highest standards of quality and reliability. This new contract strengthens SURVEY Copter’s position as a global key player for maritime mini UAS”



Nicolas Askamp, Head of Survey Copter / Airbus Unmanned Aerial Systems.

The Aliaca maritime UAS is a high endurance versatile system allowing up to 3 hours missions over a 50 km (27 Nm) range, perfectly adapted to maritime missions with high gyro stabilized EO/IR payload performances and qualified to operate in severe environmental conditions. Launched by catapult, the Aliaca maritime UAS concludes its flight by landing automatically using a dedicated net landing solution. With a length of 2,2m and a wingspan of 3,6m for a maximum take-off weight of 16 kg, the Aliaca maritime UAS benefits from a powerful yet silent electric motor. The system can be deployed easily and rapidly in less than 15 minutes by 2 operators only.

Similarly, the “user-friendly” ground control station enables the operator to constantly monitor the automatic flight of the UAS while receiving in real-time day and night images and AIS (Automatic Identification System) data gathered by its on-board sensors.

It is designed to conduct several types of missions around the ships, including increasing the understanding of the tactical situation, control of illegal operations at sea, search-and-rescue, traffic monitoring, pollution detection, tracking of any suspicious behaviour in the ship environment and coastal surveillance.

This light on-board aerial solution gives the opportunity to vessels, traditionally not equipped with aerial assets, to enhance their tactical ISR capabilities, support decision making and reactivity in operations.

The Aliaca maritime UAS can easily be integrated on board any ships, with or without helicopter landing-deck, and its small logistic footprint enables operations and storage on board smaller sized ships. Its integration does not require heavy on-board modification nor storage of specific fuel.

The result of 10 years of R&D investments and on-board experimentations, SURVEY Copter’s “off the shelf” Aliaca maritime UAS is a robust and resistant system to the corrosive maritime environment, an adapted solution to the electro-magnetic constrains on board, and benefits from an efficient net recovery system, fully automated, meaning that no human action is required during the recovery phase.

-End-

Naval News comments:

The Aliaca is set to be deployed aboard the future offshore patrol vessels of the French Navy (both the POM and future Patrouilleur Oceanique) as part of the SMDM program. The deliveries of the first “SMDM UAVs” were set to start in 2020 (according to the official publication of the French Navy).

Its mission will be to control the tactical situation around its mother-ship between 10 and 50 nautical miles. Similar in concept to the popular ScanEagle by Insitu, it will be launched via catapult and recovered via a net, meaning it may be deployed from smaller ships, even those not fitted with an helicopter deck.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8569006323814392}",positive,0.8569006323814392,1

The 10-year contract will equip the three armed forces with a common information system and set of sensors and is designated a high-impact programme (PEM[1]), alongside CONTACT and SCORPION, under France's defence spending plan. This joint tactical SIGINT system will provide French armed forces command with an expanded tactical electronic support measures (ESM) capability.

The tactical SIGINT programme will upgrade the electronic warfare capabilities of front-line units, providing a set of high-performance portable or vehicle-mounted assets compatible with the latest communications technologies. The new system to monitor and localise enemy communications will support tactical manoeuvres in the theatre of operations, helping to keep our forces safe and secure. It will equip the electronic support vehicles of the French Army's 54th Signals Regiment (SCORPION programme), the French Navy's front-line warships and the Atlantique 2 maritime patrol aircraft, and could be deployed to protect air bases on military operations overseas.

The system will be the only one of its kind in service with the French forces. All three armed forces will rely on the same logistics infrastructure to simplify training of specialist operators and optimise through-life support delivery.

The programme will benefit from the combined experience of co-contractors Thales and Airbus.

Thales will draw on the SIGINT expertise developed by the Group on several legacy programmes: COHORTE (the current French Army tactical SIGINT system), MINREM[2] (French Navy SIGINT system), ARCHANGE[3] (French Air Force new-generation SIGINT aircraft) and CLOVIS[4] (strategic interministerial communications localisation project). Thales will also build on its capabilities in end-to-end communications, radio communications and communications security.

Airbus will provide its expertise in strategic ELINT systems, drawing on its experience on programmes such as RAMSES (strategic radio and satellite communications information system) and PARADOS (radio signal acquisition sensor). These systems are currently in operational service with France's defence intelligence agency (DRM[5]), the French Army, the French Air and Space Force, and the French Navy. Airbus will also draw on its complex-systems integration and security know-how.

The first phase of the programme will provide the three armed forces with an initial operational capability for signals monitoring, with subsequent optional tranches to significantly increase the number of units in service. New functions (new data analytics functions for the information system, expanded detection and technical analysis capabilities, etc.) will be added incrementally over the term of the contract to provide the French armed forces with a set of state-of-the-art electronic warfare systems and capabilities.

""As risks evolve and expand, reliable intelligence is an essential element of sovereignty and a strategic asset for operational decision-making, force protection, territorial integrity and civil security. We are proud to be taking part in this programme to upgrade France's intelligence capabilities in support of front-line forces across all environments and to be helping to keep them safe and effective on their crucial missions"" said Marc Darmon, Executive Vice President, Secure Communications and Information Systems, Thales

""Our armed forces face an increasing number of threats and need to rely on ever expanding volumes of data,"" added François Lombard, Director of Intelligence Business at Airbus Defence and Space. ""Combined with aerial and satellite imagery and other sources, these new electronic intelligence capabilities will make it possible to identify these threats, and above all to characterise them with significantly greater precision.""

Airbus lost €1.1 billion in revenues due a slump in global travel amid the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the company said its 2020 full-year results.

CEO Guillaume Faury said on Thursday that the company's aircraft deliveries were ""far lower"" than what they had expected this year due the the pandemic, which caused airlines to ground planes amid travel restrictions.

""Global air traffic reached a low point in April 2020 at the peak of the COVID pandemic, it has recovered very slowly since and at very different paces between regions,” Faury said at a press conference.

""We continue to operate in a complex and changing environment which we expect to continue to impact our business and create uncertainties,"" he said.

In a press release, Faury said the results showed the company's ""resilience...in the most challenging crisis to hit the aerospace industry.""

Company revenues decreased in 2020 to €49.9 billion compared with €70.5 billion in 2019.

""Needless to stress what a challenging and extraordinary year 2020 has been for the civil aerospace industry and this is of course also reflected in our financial statement,"" said Dominik Asam, the Chief Financial Officer of Airbus.

Airbus announced at the end of June that it would cut 15,000 jobs due to the pandemic, reducing its workforce by 11%.

The company said in a statement that 566 commercial aircraft were delivered in 2020. It took in a mere 268 aircraft orders in 2020, down from 768 in 2019.

""The delivery number demonstrates the balancing of production and deliveries as the year progressed,"" Faury said.

Structural model is now ready for test campaign

Stevenage/Toulouse, 11 February 2021 – Biomass, the European Space Agency’s (ESA) forest measuring satellite is taking shape at Airbus’ site in Stevenage with the Structure Model Platform completed. In line with UK Government guidelines the Stevenage site is COVID-secure – enabling spacecraft production to continue safely.

Assembly of the satellite’s mechanical structure could not be carried out as planned due to COVID. But during April and May 2020, the Airbus team put in place a digital solution to enable collaboration with ESA and suppliers, ensuring progress continued on the development of the satellite’s mechanical structure.

Airbus teams finalised the structure build in the second half of 2020 and integration hardware onto the Structure Model Platform was completed in early January 2021. The Structure Model is now at Airbus Toulouse for its mechanical test campaign.

Richard Franklin, Managing Director, Airbus Defence and Space UK said: “Despite the pandemic the teams have really stepped up finding innovative ways to keep manufacture on track. The progress made demonstrates the high level of skills and capabilities of the Airbus teams and their commitment to deliver on the project.”

Michael Fehringer, ESA’s Biomass Project Manager said: “The status of the structure build as of today is a remarkable achievement given the number and variety of problems the teams had to face.”

Biomass is an ESA Earth Explorer mission due to launch in 2022. It will measure forest biomass to assess terrestrial carbon stocks and fluxes for five years. The spacecraft will carry the first space-borne P-band synthetic aperture radar to deliver exceptionally accurate maps of tropical, temperate and boreal forest biomass that are not obtainable by ground measurement techniques.

The airframer has five sites with assembly lines – in Toulouse, Hamburg, Tianjin, Mobile and Montreal – with the two European sites responsible for most single-aisle and all twin-aisle assembly.

But the disruption to production and demand, especially within the long-haul sector, is reflected in reduced Airbus output.

The airframer handed over 21 aircraft in January but only 10 were delivered from the French and German lines – five from each – according to Cirium fleets data.

Six aircraft were delivered from the US plant at Mobile, three from the Chinese plant at Tianjin, and two from the facility at Montreal Mirabel.

The airframer’s deliveries in January comprised three A220s, 16 A320-family jets, plus a single A350 and single A330neo.

Airbus separates A321XLR aft-fuselage work to avoid disrupting assembly line - Flightglobal,"Wed, 03 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mbGlnaHRnbG9iYWwuY29tL2Flcm9zcGFjZS9haXJidXMtc2VwYXJhdGVzLWEzMjF4bHItYWZ0LWZ1c2VsYWdlLXdvcmstdG8tYXZvaWQtZGlzcnVwdGluZy1hc3NlbWJseS1saW5lLzE0MjI2NC5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is establishing a separate production line at its Hamburg Finkenwerder plant which will be dedicated to assembling the aft fuselage of the long-range A321XLR.

This fuselage section is heavily modified from the regular A321neo, featuring a newly-designed integrated large rear centre tank and fuel-mangement system which will be specific to the new model.

Airbus wants to set up the separate line to enable production of this particular section to achieve maturity without the risk of disrupting the flow of A320neo-family assembly at the plant.

It will install jigs and tooling for the aft fuselage line in the Finkenwerder facility’s hall 260, on the shore of the river Elbe, where Airbus previously manufactured fuselage sections for the A380.

The airframer says this “deliberate decoupling” of the A321XLR aft fuselage and the single-aisle production line will provide the flexibility to enable the specialised fuselage work, from next year, to ramp up independently and achieve maturity without affecting output of other variants.

A321XLR programme chief Gary O’Donnell says the “stable factory” will allow longer initial manufacturing cycle times while the logistics of assembling and integrating the rear centre tank smooth out.

“This new approach will avoid us putting at risk the rest of single-aisle production,” he says. “Once we’re happy that everything is mature and up-to-speed, we can transfer it with confidence into the main production system.”

Airbus believes the A321XLR, which will serve as a bridge between its single- and twin-aisle aircraft range, is a core part of its strategy and the decision to keep to the development schedule, despite the air transport crisis, underlines its importance to the airframer.

“The XLR is one of the programmes we’ve decided to fully maintain in spite of [the pandemic],” said Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury during a briefing in early January.

“We’re very excited as we see it sits very well with market needs,” he stated. With long-haul recovery likely to lag short-haul, Faury argued that the XLR – offering long-range with single-aisle capacity and economics – could become “even more” important to customers post-crisis.

Chief commercial officer Christian Scherer, at the same briefing, said the A321XLR “continues to enjoy very strong market demand”.

“I wish I had more,” he said, stressing that the variant was “not a niche aircraft”.

Airbus expects to commence major component assembly of the first A321XLR – bringing together the forward, centre and aft fuselage sections and the wings – over the “second part” of this year. It says a “large proportion” of the engineering design drawings had been released by the beginning of 2021.

“Production of components for the first A321XLR flight-test aircraft is progressing through the sites all across the world, for large and small components as well as systems,” says O’Donnell.

“In parallel many parts are already being tested and demonstrated – on both the aircraft structure and on the systems side – to validate the functionality of all those first aircraft components.”

Airbus’s Nantes facility is progressing with manufacturing the first centre wing-box, which will be transferred to Finkenwerder this year, while Premium Aerotec is completing the initial rear centre tank components and preparing for its assembly at its Augsburg centre, and producing other centre- and aft-fuselage parts at Nordenham and Varel.

Nose and forward fuselage sections for the A321XLR are being built at Stelia Aerospace and these will be sent to St Nazaire for assembly once complete. Airbus’s UK plant at Broughton is handling the wing production in co-operation with Spirit AeroSystems and FACC which are dealing with new high-lift devices for the aircraft.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999668598175049}",neutral,0.9999668598175049,0

Paris, 11th February 2021 – Airbus Defence and Space mini UAS subsidiary SURVEY Copter signed a contract with French DGA Armament general directorate to provide the French Navy with 11 systems, (22 aircraft), of the electrically powered fixed-wing Aliaca maritime version UAS (officially called SMDM / “Systèmes de Mini Drones aériens embarqués pour la Marine” by French authorities), including training and integrated logistic support. First deliveries are expected in 2021.

“We are honored to contribute to the missions of the French Navy which we will support with the highest standards of quality and reliability. This new contract strengthens SURVEY Copter’s position as a global key player for maritime mini UAS”, said Nicolas Askamp, Head of Survey Copter / Airbus Unmanned Aerial Systems.

The Aliaca maritime UAS is a high endurance versatile system allowing up to 3 hours missions over a 50 km (27 Nm) range, perfectly adapted to maritime missions with high gyro stabilized EO/IR payload performances and qualified to operate in severe environmental conditions. Launched by catapult, the Aliaca maritime UAS concludes its flight by landing automatically using a dedicated net landing solution. With a length of 2,2m and a wingspan of 3,6m for a maximum take-off weight of 16 kg, the Aliaca maritime UAS benefits from a powerful yet silent electric motor. The system can be deployed easily and rapidly in less than 15 minutes by 2 operators only.

Similarly, the “user-friendly” ground control station enables the operator to constantly monitor the automatic flight of the UAS while receiving in real-time day and night images and AIS (Automatic Identification System) data gathered by its on-board sensors.

It is designed to conduct several types of missions around the ships, including increasing the understanding of the tactical situation, control of illegal operations at sea, search-and-rescue, traffic monitoring, pollution detection, tracking of any suspicious behaviour in the ship environment and coastal surveillance.

This light on-board aerial solution gives the opportunity to vessels, traditionally not equipped with aerial assets, to enhance their tactical ISR capabilities, support decision making and reactivity in operations.

The Aliaca maritime UAS can easily be integrated on board any ships, with or without helicopter landing-deck, and its small logistic footprint enables operations and storage on board smaller sized ships. Its integration does not require heavy on-board modification nor storage of specific fuel.

The result of 10 years of R&D investments and on-board experimentations, SURVEY Copter’s “off the shelf” Aliaca maritime UAS is a robust and resistant system to the corrosive maritime environment, an adapted solution to the electro-magnetic constrains on board, and benefits from an efficient net recovery system, fully automated, meaning that no human action is required during the recovery phase.

This Airbus prototype could deploy drones from cargo planes - Popular Science,"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHNjaS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9haXJidXMtYWlyLWxhdW5jaGVkLWRyb25lcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For a small aircraft, any stretch of open sky can become a runway, if another plane is able to carry it to altitude first. On December 9, 2020, Airbus revealed a prototype of an airborne launcher that is designed to carefully release uncrewed aerial vehicles, or drones, from the loading ramp of a cargo aircraft into the sky while in flight.

This launcher is built to go in an Airbus A400M, a four-engined turboprop transport that entered service with France in 2013, and has since been adopted by other nation’s militaries. The plane has a range of 2,100 miles with a full payload just shy of 82,000 pounds, but can go further if it carries less weight.

In an announcement video, Airbus showed an aerial target drone inside an A400M. Aerial target drones are affordably built, and used as a type of robotic clay pigeon for fighter jets and anti-air missiles. The low cost of target drones has made them a useful starting point for designing useful, expendable military drones—ones that fit the dimensions for launch from the back of a cargo plane, but carry useful sensors or weapons needed to perform a military mission.

Given the wingspan constraints imposed by the width of the actual cargo hold, the drone is a good approximation for the size and range of any plane-launched flying robot. An Airbus aerial target drone like a DO-DT-25R (a catchy name, to be sure) can fly for about 60 miles. Putting it inside a carrier with the range of the turboprop in question extends that range by two orders of magnitude. It gives militaries a tremendous range of possibility when it comes to using drones for war.

“Imagine a future combat scenario where multiple remote carriers are required in the first days of a future combat,” Andreas Heckmann, the project lead on the launcher at Airbus, said in a video about the prototype. “And you have an A400M in almost all European nations, and you could launch UAVS, remote carriers in this case, from the transport aircraft, and later on multiple UAVs.”

The news begs the question: What kind of scenario calls for planes that can launch other planes? It’s a topic that designers have pondered for nearly a century, dating back at least to the 1930s and airship-mounted escort biplanes (a real thing the US Navy built and tested). The most immediate reason to put smaller planes on a bigger plane is to protect those bigger aircraft from enemy fighters. The XF-85 Goblin, which Popular Science covered in December 1948, was a tiny human-piloted jet, built to ride in the belly of a massive B-36 nuke-carrying bomber, and then be released to protect the bomber from enemy air-to-air fighters.

[Related: Everything to know about the bombers that flew over Super Bowl LV]

Two developments beyond the design of the Goblin itself doomed the concept. The first was that fighter jet design got better, making a dedicated bomber-mounted escort irrelevant. The second, and far more important, was that anti-air missiles became the main risk to bombers, with a range and speed that an escort fighter could do little about.

The persistent dominance of missile-based anti-air weapons from the Cold War to today is now bringing plane-launched drones back into consideration. Drones have a few advantages over human-piloted craft dropped by planes. The first is that they are expendable, both in terms of material cost and also because they do not risk the life of an on-board pilot to operate.

In the United States, DARPA, the Pentagon’s blue-sky projects wing, has tried to answer this question for the better part of a decade. The signature program is Gremlins, which has also completed not just aerial launch of drones, but aerial recovery of drones. More recently, DARPA announced the LongShot project, which involves air-launched drones that would themselves be able to fight with air-to-air weapons.

[Related: DARPA’s new combat drones could catch a ride from other aircraft]

These flying robots could be part of how aircraft get around anti-air missiles. Transport aircraft could send many armed, relatively cheap drones to attack anti-air missile installations, destroying the weapons and the people crewing them. With that path cleared, other aircraft could move in and attack other military installations. It could also clear a path for transport aircraft to land, unloading humans and vehicles and cargo that could then fight on the ground.

Answering the threat of anti-air missiles is just one possible use for plane-launched more-expendable drones. In more peacetime settings, transports that could launch durable scout aircraft could fly to the site of a natural disaster, and then use the drone to see if there is a viable landing area below.

The Airbus prototype opens the possibility for plane-launched planes to play a greater role in the wars of the future. Provided, of course, the prototype actually works as promised.

Airbus Courts Eco-Conscious Investors With Hybrid Plane Announcement and New Emissions Disclosures - The Motley Fool,"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAyLzI2L2FpcmJ1cy1jb3VydHMtZWNvLWNvbnNjaW91cy1pbnZlc3RvcnMtd2l0aC1oeWJyaWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The European aerospace giant is getting serious about shrinking the industry's carbon footprint.

Airbus (EADSY -1.30%) is working on hybrid-electric propulsion systems for airplanes, putting pressure on archrival Boeing (BA -1.96%) to up its investment in technologies that can help reduce the aviation industry's carbon footprint over time.

The European aerospace giant disclosed the work as part of its Scope 3 report, an attempt to document the emissions generated by its products over their lifetimes. Airbus said the 1,429 planes it delivered in the last two years were likely to emit more than 1 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide during their service lives, highlighting the importance of aviation in any effort to reduce emissions.

Aviation accounts for about 2.5% of global carbon dioxide emissions, according to University of Oxford statistics, and that is expected to increase in the decades to come as demand for travel grows in the developing world.

Airbus last fall unveiled designs for a zero-emission hydrogen plane, and said in the report it is working on a number of other technologies as well, including an electric hybrid propulsion system. While hydrogen would be the ideal solution, since the only by-product is water, it seems unlikely the technology will advance fast enough to power large planes in the near future.

Hybrids could be at least a stop-gap measure that could reduce emissions while other technologies mature, with hybrid planes potentially entering service in the next decade.

Boeing is also experimenting with advanced propulsion systems, including via investments in start-ups, but the company has focused much of its near-term efforts on ways to make existing propulsion systems more fuel efficient. That's likely to change in the years to come should Airbus show progress on hybrids.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8713781833648682}",neutral,0.8713781833648682,0

New heights of comfort

Sporting new design features and offering a high level of passenger comfort consistent with Airbus’ widebody A330neo and A350 Airspace cabin products, Airspace for the A320 Family presents:

A redesigned entrance area with a customisable welcome lighting;

New extra large “XL” overhead bins - the largest in its class;

Re-styled window bezels which allow more light into the cabin;

Integrated window shades and new side walls delivering a sleek, customized look while yielding even more shoulder room;

New lavatories with anti-microbial coatings and touchless features;

A customizable ‘hero’ ceiling light plus full-colour LED lighting throughout the cabin.

Michael Willmer, Airbus’ technical leader for the A320 Family Airspace Cabin programme explains that the rationale for these tests is to ensure the overall maturity and robustness of the new cabin during flight.

Rigorous testing for take-off

“The initial in-flight testing subjected the cabin to conditions well beyond what it would normally be subjected to in a standard flight profile. Special cameras and sensors throughout the interior were connected to dedicated flight-test and recording equipment in the cabin so that the engineers could analyse the performance and characteristics of the cabin elements in real-time on board, as well as in the lab afterwards,"" said Willmer.

“Overall, we are pleased with the results of the first phase. Now this second flight-testing stage, together with the lessons-learnt from previous developments, will further help to ensure a robust product at entry into service in the coming months,” added Willmer.

The Airspace cabin originally announced at the Paris Air Show in June 2017 for the A320 family has come a long way from the initial concept drawings, 3D virtual reality and hardware mockups seen at the trade shows. The A320 Family’s new Airspace cabin took shape during last year’s “full-scale cabin installation test” – when Airbus’ teams performed a trial installation of a fully integrated cabin in an A321neo fuselage.

Willmer concludes: “Today the teams are thrilled that their Airspace product for the A320 Family has become a reality.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9991443157196045}",positive,0.9991443157196045,1

"Airbus reports loss of €1bn after Covid, and could shed 15,000 jobs - The Guardian","Thu, 18 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxL2ZlYi8xOC9haXJidXMtbG9zcy0xYm4tY292aWQtam9ic9IBS2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxL2ZlYi8xOC9haXJidXMtbG9zcy0xYm4tY292aWQtam9icw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus plummeted to a loss of more than €1bn last year and will continue to withhold shareholder payouts after deliveries of its aircraft fell by a third.

The European aerospace giant warned aircraft would remain under pressure in the year ahead amid a “volatile environment” created by the coronavirus pandemic.

Airbus delivered 566 commercial aircraft in 2020, down sharply from 863 the year before, and expects to deliver the same number in 2021.

The company warned last summer that it would face the “gravest crisis” in its history due to the pandemic, and planned to cut as many as 15,000 jobs, including 1,700 in the UK.

The slowdown in aircraft deliveries caused revenues at Airbus to fall by 27% to €49.9bn (£42.4bn) last year, leading to a net loss of €1.13bn for 2020. The gloomy financial result follows a €1.36bn loss in 2019 after the company was forced to pay a record £3bn in penalties for paying bribes on an “endemic” basis to land contracts in 20 countries.

Announcing Airbus’s annual results on Thursday, Guillaume Faury, the chief executive, said many uncertainties remained for the industry as “the pandemic continues to impact lives, economies and societies”. He said he hoped the company’s guidance would “provide some visibility in a volatile environment”.

But Peter McNally, an industry expert at research firm Third Bridge, said the outlook for 2021 could “prove disappointing to some investors”.

“Commercial airlines are off to a difficult start in 2021 and the outlook from Airbus reflects that,” he said. “The situation could improve as vaccines are more widely distributed, but Airbus executives note most of their customer base will be burning cash most of this year.”

Shares in Airbus fell 2.8% to €91.29 on Thursday.

The coronavirus has wreaked havoc on the travel and aircraft industries following severe restrictions to limit its spread.

“The bright side is that leisure travel has been the area that has started its recovery first, and the Airbus order book is geared for that eventual uptick with their A320 fleet,” McNally said.

According to aerospace and defence lobby group ADS more than a 10th of the jobs in the UK’s aerospace industry could be cut as the plane manufacturers Airbus and Boeing and their suppliers adjust to lower demand.

A large number of those job losses will come from Airbus and the engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, which are both making thousands of redundancies. The difficult year for the aerospace sector is also expected to hit smaller supply chain workers.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9999070167541504}",negative,0.9999070167541504,-1

Airbus and University of Surrey develop space coating to protect satellites against oxygen damage in orbit - Airbus,"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTAyLWFpcmJ1cy1hbmQtdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1vZi1zdXJyZXktZGV2ZWxvcC1zcGFjZS1jb2F0aW5nLXRvLXByb3RlY3Qtc2F0ZWxsaXRlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Nano-level coating can protect satellites in low-Earth orbit from ultraviolet radiation and atomic oxygen

Stevenage/Friedrichshafen, 15 February 2021 - Airbus Defence and Space and the Advanced Technology Institute, University of Surrey, have developed a breakthrough nano-barrier that can protect satellites in low-Earth orbit from ultraviolet radiation and atomic oxygen.

Atomic oxygen (O) is created when O2 molecules break apart, a process made easier in space because of the abundance of ultraviolet radiation. Atomic oxygen then reacts with organic surfaces on spacecraft and degrades them. Engineers from Airbus and the Advanced Technology Institute have developed a nano-barrier and custom-built deposition system that bonds to the surface of polymer or composite materials, protecting them from the erosion caused by atomic oxygen.

The new cutting-edge nano-barrier allows for large-area, conformal coating on complex 3D structures such as spacecraft and optical mirrors. This eliminates the risk of contamination and the need to wrap instruments with multi-layer insulation, opening up opportunities to increase satellite performance.

Christopher Hess, Head of Microwave Instruments at Airbus Space Systems, said: “This breakthrough technology is an enabler for extremely agile, high performance space borne radar missions. It should have a huge positive impact on overall mission performance by offering higher flexibility in the acquisition as well as increasing the possible imaged area – giving our instruments greater performance.”

In a paper published by the scientific journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, engineers showed how they have constructed the multilayer stack to overcome several issues previously reported in space, like coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch or surface undercutting erosion, as a result providing a complete nano-barrier protection for advanced polymeric and composite materials in LEO.

By applying a combination of a buffer and highly-dense amorphous layers the thermal cycling and intrinsic stress effects are reduced. This enables moisture and outgassing protection in tandem creating a dimensionally stable platform, and thereby preventing material degradation. Further oxide nano-layers are used to both enhance atomic oxygen/UV protection and simultaneously improve thermo-optical properties of the substrates by controlling the optical band gap of the entire nano-barrier stack. This effectively facilitates radiative cooling by minimising the heat that could be built-up on the surface and degrade materials.

The new deposition system built by Airbus and Surrey’s Advanced Technology Institute, ensures a complete conformal coverage of the nano-barrier at room temperature, so sensitive polymeric and composite materials can be coated without approaching their glass transition temperatures.

The teams from Airbus and Surrey’s Advanced Technology Institute are now working on the next stage leading to industrialisation of the coating to enable the first LEO missions to be treated from 2022.

Eurostar Neo: increased payload capacity and more efficient power and thermal control systems for video connectivity



Toulouse, 12 February 2021 – Airbus Defence and Space has successfully completed a key milestone in the manufacturing of the first Eurostar Neo satellite, with the successful integration of the Service and Communication Modules of EUTELSAT HOTBIRD 13F.

Airbus’ Portsmouth team delivered the EUTELSAT HOTBIRD 13F Communications Module to Toulouse at the start of January 2021 where it joined the Stevenage and Toulouse produced Service Module. The EUTELSAT HOTBIRD 13F satellite is now beginning its final series of tests in preparation for its launch.



With the new Eurostar Neo platform, the payload capacity can be greatly increased, with the Communication Module able to accommodate up to 2 tons of payload and provide payload power of more than 25kW. EUTELSAT HOTBIRD 13F and 13G will both have spacecraft power of 22 kW and a launch mass of only 4,500 kg.



François Gaullier, Head of Telecom Systems at Airbus Space Systems said: “This is an important milestone for our new generation Eurostar Neo programme, and is all the more remarkable having been achieved despite the Covid pandemic. With increased payload capacity and more efficient power and thermal control systems Eurostar Neo combines major innovations with tried-and-tested technologies, resulting in a product line that will be as reliable as ever while delivering the best performance in the market.”



Airbus’ Eurostar Neo platform has been developed in the frame of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Partnership Projects, together with the French space agency CNES, and strongly supported by the UK Space Agency and other agencies across Europe.

The shops, which UPS is not naming until signed contracts are in place, will each start single upgrade lines in May or June, said Ed Walton, the package carrier’s director of engineering. A third line is possible for surge capacity if needed.

If all goes as planned, all 51 aircraft will have upgraded cockpits by the 2022 holiday peak season. They will join the first modified aircraft, recently delivered to UPS after two years of flight-testing. That aircraft is slated to re-join the UPS fleet in the coming weeks following a scheduled C-check and needed U.S. FAA approvals of modified training and manuals, Walton said.

UPS, Honeywell, and Airbus announced the project in May 2017.

“We really tasked the team to take a look at everything on the airplane that they felt could be obsolete over the time frame we were looking at, which was 20 years,” Walton said. “That’s where the effort came to settle on the project that we’ve got now—the modifications and why each one was selected.”

The upgrade is built around a new avionics suite based on Honeywell’s Primus Epic product. Airbus led integration on the project, which netted the manufacturer a type certificate extension, via a service bulletin, that can be sold to other A300-600 operators, said Olivier Criou, Airbus head and chief engineer of A300/A310 programs.

For UPS, the upgrade brings both more immediate flexibility and “future-proofs” to an important sub-fleet, Walton said. Immediate improvements include upgraded weather radar, new standby instruments, a digital aircraft communications addressing and reporting system (ACARS), and a new flight-management computer (FMC) with more memory.

The current A300-600 FMC has about 200 kb of memory. As the airline’s U.S. flight navigation database grew, it had to be broken into five segments to fit on the FMC, with only segment one loaded at a time. The aircraft then flies within the region covered by the segment. Moving it to another region means spending 45 min. changing the database.

“An airplane that would fly, say, from Newark to Louisville would pretty much need to go back to the Northeast to be able to fly with the same database,” Walton said. “Mechanics spending 45 minutes updating a database is 45 minutes that could be spent doing pre-departure checks or” fixing other issues, Walton added.

The new flight management computer can take the entire database, and updates take about 2 min., Walton said.

Modernizing the avionics also ensures that UPS can continue to operate its 52 A300-600s with maximum efficiency within the subfleet’s all-North American network. New approach procedures will be added to the A300-600 database as soon as they are available.

“If your database doesn’t include those departures and arrivals, you [can] get kicked out of the queue and have to hold until [air traffic control] has the time to deal with you,” Walton said. “By having this we future-proofed this airplane.” The A300-600s fill a key role in UPS’s fleet, fitting between the airline’s Boeing 757s and 767s and operating at most four cycles/day, all within North America. They average 17 years of age, but more importantly, the oldest airframe has flown just 14,500 cycles, well below the model’s extended service life target of 42,000 cycles.

The upgrades give the carrier confidence that it can operate its A300-600s through 2040 or so, Walton said. They will fly alongside 757s and 767s, which also have upgraded cockpits featuring Collins Avionics equipment. The 757 upgrades are complete, while the last 767 in the fleet is expected to be done in April, Walton said.

“The A300 really fits our network very well,” Walton said. “We’ve taken care of these airplanes. We have no concerns at all about the airframes being able to go to 2035 and beyond.”

Volotea sees growth after switch to all-Airbus fleet - Flightglobal,"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vZmxlZXRzL3ZvbG90ZWEtc2Vlcy1ncm93dGgtYWZ0ZXItc3dpdGNoLXRvLWFsbC1haXJidXMtZmxlZXQvMTQyNTYyLmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European carrier Volotea could add four further Airbus narrowbodies to its fleet this summer after completing the withdrawal of its Boeing 717 fleet.

Volotea has operated 717s since launching flights in 2012, but began bringing in Airbus A319s in 2016 after opting to replace the Boeing jets with used narrowbodies from the European manufacturer. The company says it had originally been aiming to complete the renewal by 2023.

Under accelerated plans the carrier has completed the withdrawal of 14 717s and replaced them with 15 A320-family aircraft. It says it has flexibility to add four more of the type if demand warrants them. It would take to 35 to 39 the number of aicraft, all Airbus narrowbodies, it would operate this summer.

While traffic has been hit by the pandemic, Volotea passenger numbers and capacity were down by less than half in 2020 driven by a strong performance in the third quarter. The Barcelona-headquartered carrier, which handled 3.8 million passengers last year, operates largely across French, Italian and Spanish markets.

Volotea president Carlos Munoz says: ”We are very proud to be moving to a 100% Airbus fleet. As a European airline, we are very excited to be able to count on Airbus as a long-term partner to our fleet.

”We will continue to grow thanks to our strategy of connecting small and medium-sized European cities with each other with a more modern and competitive aircraft model, the Airbus A320, which offers 20-25% lower operating costs than [our] previous Boeing 717s. This increased competitiveness will be highly needed in the post-Covid context of the coming years, where less demand is likely to occur.”

He adds: “This change will also allow us to be in the best position to seize in advance new great opportunities such as the one created in Spain, through the acquisition of Air Europa by Iberia [parent IAG] and in France, where the restructuring of the regional market is under way.”

Under a provisional agreement struck with IAG prior to the crisis, Volotea was set to open at least two, and up to four, bases in Spain in order to pick up routes through slots transferred from either Iberia or Air Europa as a mitigation for securing competition approval. IAG put that acquisition ice last year but, having agreed fresh terms, it hopes to close the purchase in the second half of 2021.

Has Rolls-Royce lost its plot in commercial aviation? - AeroTime,"Tue, 09 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjcyMDktcm9sbHMtcm95Y2UtbWFya2V0LXNpdHVhdGlvbtIBSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjcyMDktcm9sbHMtcm95Y2UtbWFya2V0LXNpdHVhdGlvbi9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rolls-Royce has been one of the well-established names in commercial aviation, as its engines have powered many iconic aircraft over history, including such legendary aircraft as the Boeing 747, Concorde and the Lockheed L-1011. The engine makers power plants’ also serve the newer generation of icons, such as the Airbus A380, Airbus A350, and the Boeing 787. However, most recently, the tide had turned against the company.

Rolls-Royce struggled, even before the current pandemic-induced downturn. The COVID-19 crisis only made the pain more intense at RR, as seemingly, the engine maker was particularly exposed to a market downturn. So much so, that the company is planning a two-week-long break at its commercial aircraft engine manufacturing facilities in order to curb costs. In addition, Rolls-Royce is in active negotiations with its unions to deliver a 10% “productivity and efficiency improvement across our Civil Aerospace operations in the UK.”

But the source of the trouble at the British company could be traced back through several points in history, as some strategic decisions have led to this point.

Deteriorating market

However, was the British company particularly exposed to the current downturn, considering its lineup of products?

After all, the Rolls-Royce Trent family powers such aircraft as the Airbus A330, A340, A350, A380, and Boeing’s 777 and the 787. The common theme among all of them? They are wide-body aircraft, which have lost popularity amongst airlines as international travel was essentially halted since March 2020. According to data by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), narrow-body aircraft usage dropped by 59.5% in July 2020 compared to the same month a year prior. Meanwhile, twin-aisle aircraft saw 75.1% less usage by that point. Since then, aircraft usage has only been on the rise: yet by December 2020, single-aisle jets had 48.4% fewer flights, while twin-aisle had 59% compared to December 2019, highlighting the rift between the two aircraft types.

Furthermore, airlines largely shied away from quad-engine aircraft such as the Airbus A340 or the Airbus A380, or older twin-aisle jets. Due to their higher operating costs, carriers opted to retire many of them permanently. For example, only 21 out of 219 Airbus A380 aircraft were actively flying, while the number of active A340s was 53, compared to 118 at the end of 2019, according to Cirium data.

“The 777 overhaul costs are among the highest in the industry for any aircraft type, and A330s are in oversupply with much younger aircraft available,” according to Cirium aviation analyst Syed Zaidi. “The result is the older A330s and 777s getting retired sooner than originally anticipated and being replaced with newer generation, more economical wide-body aircraft like the A350 and 787,” he added.

Seemingly, the retirement of older aircraft has left Rolls-Royce particularly exposed, as new aircraft deliveries were not particularly favorable to the British company.

Glimmers of hope?

While cargo has provided a glimmer of hope for commercial airlines, as the demand crunch caused by fewer flights taking belly capacity with it has provided some revenue, signs of hope for Rolls-Royce were few and far between.

Neither the Boeing 777F nor the 767F, which the aircraft manufacturer has delivered 102 and 95 respectively since 2015, are powered by a Rolls-Royce power plant. Even converted freighters, like the 767-300 BDSF or the 777-300ERSF will carry General Electric engines. Overall, out of the total 1,352 wide-body aircraft that Boeing delivered between 2015 and 2020, 275 were powered by the British manufacturer’s engines, all of them of the Dreamliner family. Out of the total 1,621 orders for the 787 with a specified engine choice, the British company managed to nail down 504 (31%), allowing the General Electric GEnx to dominate the market share for the 787’s engines. Some airlines, like All Nippon Airways (ANA), have made the switch from the Trent 1000 to the GEnx, when the Japanese airline ordered 12 Boeing 787 aircraft in October 2020. Prior to the order, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 74 Dreamliners to ANA with the Trent 1000 engine, including the first-ever delivery of the 787 in September 2011.

The issues of Trent 1000 have been well known, as the company had to re-design nine components of the engine to fix various issues. By the end of 2019, Rolls-Royce had completed the design of eight components, with seven of them certified by various civil aviation authorities. All in all, the company estimated that between 2017 and 2023, the issues with the Trent 1000 will set the company back around £2.4 billion ($3.3 billion). At the end of 2019, the troublemaking engine amounted to 13% of Rolls-Royce’s total wide-body engine fleet.

While COVID-19 has ravaged the aviation industry, it also allowed the engine maker to save cash, as airlines used fewer wide-body aircraft than previously, including the Boeing 787. According to the company’s H1 2020 update, the pandemic allowed Rolls-Royce to save £498 million ($685.9 million), as the zero Aircraft on Ground (AoG) point was reached in June 2020. At the end of 2019, Rolls-Royce’s goal was to reduce AoG numbers to below 10 by Q2 2020. The “elevated level” of AoG was as much as 42 in H2 2019, highlighted the company. Still, the pandemic has had its effect on the engine maker, as it made the decision to let go at least 9,000 of its employees by the end of 2022.

Nevertheless, if Boeing is not as important to Rolls-Royce, then Airbus definitely is: every wide-body of the European manufacturer has an option to be powered by a member of the Trent engine family.

Helping hand in Toulouse?

RR’s last hope seemingly remains with Airbus with the A330 and the A350. The Trent 700, which is one of the three engines to power the A330ceo, has enjoyed a fairly sizeable market share, with 58% A330-200s and 68% A330-300s powered by the Rolls-Royce engine, according to ICF data. However, the backlog of A330ceo aircraft is only going down and will soon dry up, with 16 orders for the A330-200 and eight for the A330-300 remaining as of January 31, 2021, per Airbus Orders and Deliveries data. Unfortunately, the upgraded A330neo is hanging on a thread, as a large chunk of the re-engined aircraft’s backlog is dubious. Such airlines as AirAsiaX or Iran Air have questionable capabilities to take new orders from the European manufacturer for a different variety of reasons, including financial difficulties exhibited by the Malaysian low-cost carrier.

Nevertheless, there is the option for the A330ceo to be converted to a freighter under the A330 P2F program. While the demand so far has been lackluster, as only six aircraft of the type were converted to a freighter, per planepsotters.net, it could improve with the wide-body’s value going down. Ishka and OAG pointed out that the A330-200 lost around $12 million (from around $39 million to $27 million) in value, while the A330-300’s value went down (from around $47 million to around $31 million), potentially providing an abundance of feedstock for the conversion program and hope for Rolls-Royce for a very lively second-hand market. According to Airbus’ estimates, the demand for the converted mid-size freighters stood at around 900 conversions. Out of the six currently converted A330s, all are powered by the Trent 700.

In addition to the wide-body engine family, Rolls-Royce was one of the founding partners of International Aero Engines, which in turn developed the IAE V2500 engine. It is currently used on such aircraft as the Airbus A320ceo family (excluding the A318), the McDonnell Douglas MD-90 and the Embraer KC-390. However, the British company backed away from the consortium, which was founded in 1983. In addition, the A320ceo backlog, much like the A330ceo, is shrinking. According to Airbus Orders and Deliveries data, as of January 31, 2021, there are four A319ceo, 18 A320ceo and 25 A321ceo aircraft remaining on order.

“More than 7,600 V2500 engines have been delivered to customers worldwide,” said a Pratt & Whitney spokesperson in a comment to AeroTime News. The company did not provide information of the market share it holds on the A320ceo.

Exiting the narrow-body market

Rolls-Royce completed its move away from IAE in 2012, as it sold its stake in the consortium for $1.5 billion in June of the same year. While it did exit the joint venture, the British company seemingly cast itself a safety net, as it agreed to “receive an agreed payment for each hour flown by the current installed fleet of V2500-powered aircraft for the next fifteen years,” read RR’s statement at the time. At the end of 2019, the British conglomerate earned £35 million ($48.1 million) from the V2500, a significant turn for the worse compared to the revenue it earned in 2018: £126 million ($173.5 million).

The decision to part ways from IAE seemingly came from a disagreement with another engine maker, Pratt & Whitney regarding the future of the consortium. While P&W wanted to offer new engines for the A320neo through IAE, Rolls-Royce vetoed the move, as the US-based company developed the PW1000G family, previously known as the Geared Turbofan (GTF). While Rolls-Royce’s former President of the Civilian Aerospace Division Mark King indicated at the time that “the two companies are saying we want to work together in the future,” the British company walked away from the A320neo program – a program that so far has amassed over 7,400 orders since its launch in 2010 – making the move questionable, to say the least.

Pratt & Whitney made further strides with the PW1000G family, as it is the sole supplier of engines for the Airbus A220, Embraer E2 jet and SpaceJet families. While P&W competes against CFM, a joint venture of General Electric and France’s Safran for the A320neo and Aviadvigatel for the Irkut MC-21, the number of potential narrow-body aircraft orders that Rolls-Royce missed out on is quite substantial.

Whether the British conglomerate could once again return to the narrow-body is perhaps still an option on the table. While RR’s future products include two engines for wide-body aircraft, namely the Advance3 and the UltraFan, and a power plant aimed to cater to the business jet market, there could be the possibility that Rolls-Royce would once again team up with Pratt & Whitney to compete for new and upcoming projects. There are a fair share of projects coming up, whether that would be Boeing’s newly-rumored mid-market aircraft or Airbus zero-emission aircraft tentatively called ZEROe.

Perhaps that is the future where Rolls-Royce fortunes lie. At the same time, the company is looking to develop the aforementioned Advance3 and UltraFan, both targeted at wide-body aircraft and that could be the direction that the company is looking to move forward without shifting its focus away. Ultimately, the current pandemic-induced crisis is a black swan event and this too shall pass. Re-jigging your whole business due to a temporary, yet painful blip could be a short-sighted decision that could come back to bite one in the bottom in the long-term.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9926002025604248}",negative,0.9926002025604248,-1

The Dubai-based airline switched up its order book and opted for the smaller and much more economical A350. Ever since, the situation has only gotten worse, as the pandemic has upended the business model that the Airbus A380 most relied on – feeding traffic through a hub onto a Super Jumbo. While the industry’s bodies have provided various predictions of when aviation will eventually recover, little hope was provided for the comeback of the quad-engine aircraft, including the A380.

Many operators of the double-decker have permanently phased out their Airbus A380 aircraft, as the economics of the jet simply does not make a positive impact on an airline’s final line. Despite the fact that there were some signs of positivity, recently shared by executives from airlines that have the A380 in their fleet, its days are still numbered.

However, for those unlucky that are yet to do so, there will be some opportunities to fly the aircraft before it sadly disappears from the skies forever.

Switching up

Perhaps, the best indication of the A380s eventual demise could be retraced to the same Valentine’s Day of 2019, when the Dubai-based airline and the manufacturer came to an agreement to reshuffle the former’s order book.

On that fatal to the Airbus A380 day, the two parties announced that Emirates will axe 39 orders for the Super Jumbo, finalizing the number of double-deckers it would eventually operate to a maximum of 123. To replace the void, the flag carrier of Dubai would instead take 40 A330-900 and 30 A350-900 aircraft. Seemingly, that agreement was not finalized, as a few months later, the manufacturer announced that Emirates ordered 50 Airbus A350 aircraft in November 2019.

“Complementing our A380s and 777s, the A350 XWBs will give us added operational flexibility in terms of capacity, range and deployment. In effect, we are strengthening our business model to provide efficient and comfortable air transport services to, and through, our Dubai hub,” at the time commented the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum.

The previous order, which included the A330-900 and the A350-900 was nowhere to be seen in Airbus’ Orders & Delivery data.

Emirates was clearly gearing up for a future that once again included emphasis on a more diverse and efficient twin-engine fleet with several cockpit types present. While that does increase costs, as the airline will need to train personnel and stock up on spare parts, as some of the reasons, the move will also allow the carrier to be more flexible in terms of its operations. The smaller capacity aircraft will allow Emirates to fly thinner routes that perhaps did not make economic sense with either the A380 or the Boeing 777. After all, the Airbus A350 is not the only smaller twin-engine aircraft that the illustrious carrier has on order – the Boeing 787 Dreamliner is also tied to the carrier’s books.

Repeating story

The same story repeats itself as one flips through the pages of other airlines’ stories. For example, Air France, which already retired all 10 of its A380s, pointed out several factors why it would retire its Super Jumbos in November 2019. For one, the French airline pointed out that other aircraft would be “better fit with market needs, through smaller gauge aircraft with increased frequencies,” in addition to the fact that Air France would have had to refurbish the cabins on the A380. The cabin refurbishment, engine and airframe Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) procedures would have set back the airline a whopping €400 million ($485 million). Considering that the estimated useful life of the A380 is only 12 years. The airline’s first double-decker arrived in October 2009, meaning that Air France had quite a decision on its hands about what to do with the aircraft – and even before the current pandemic hit, the company announced that it would sell five of its Airbus A380 aircraft by 2022 in July 2019.

Lufthansa (LHAB) (LHA) seemingly also danced to the same tune that other A380 operators were listening to. The German airline announced that it would phase out six of 14 of its Super Jumbos in 2022 and 2023 in March 2019. Citing “economic reasons,” the airline also cited the fact that the “structure of the network and the long-haul fleet, fundamentally optimized according to strategic aspects, will give the company more flexibility and at the same time increase its efficiency and competitiveness.”

Much like Emirates, Lufthansa (LHAB) (LHA) announced that it would opt for twin-engine wide-body aircraft, namely the Airbus A350 and the Boeing 787.

“By replacing four-engine planes with new models, we are laying a sustainable foundation for our future in the long run,” commented on the order and the sale of the A380 the chief executive of Lufthansa Carsten Sphor.

Unsurprisingly, more airlines turned their backs on the aircraft as COVID-19 halted international travel. It might have been clear that air travel would change, once the world climbs out of the hellhole that the current pandemic has thrown it in. Changes seemingly would hit mega hubs and subsequently, large aircraft, particularly hard, as passengers are predicted to be reluctant to connect through to their final destination, avoiding another large crowd at the connecting airport.

Last glimmers of hope

Several airlines in unison with their base airports had adopted the mega-hub model, including Airbus A380 operators like Emirates, Etihad Airways, Singapore Airlines (SIA1) (SINGY), or Qatar Airways. Singapore Airlines (SIA1) (SINGY), for one, was the first to phase out its Super Jumbo as the Changi Airport (SIN)-based airline retired its first A380 in November 2017. Following only nine years of flying, the aircraft became the only Airbus double-decker to find a second home with the Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance and Insurance (ACMI)-type airline Hi Fly.

Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways also were not very keen on the idea to fly the A380, leaving Emirates, and for a brief moment Hi Fly, as the only active operators of the aircraft. While Etihad Airways has grounded the Super Jumbo indefinitely without indicating a decided fate as of yet, the Doha, Qatar-based airline’s chief executive was eccentric as always regarding the future of Qatar Airways Airbus A380 aircraft.

“The A380 is one of the worst aircraft when it comes to emissions that is flying today. That is why we have decided that we will not operate them for the foreseeable future – and even when we will operate them, we will only operate half of the numbers we have,” commented Akbar Al Baker, publicly offering to sell them during CAPA Live January 2021.

Nevertheless, some will still live on. Emirates President Tim Clark indicated that the airline will operate the double-decker at least until the mid-2030s. After all, the airline did install its newest Premium Economy cabin offering on the aircraft in December 2020, which has been very popular amongst the carrier’s customers, according to Clark.

Qantas could be another airline that will eventually once again fly the double-decker. The airline’s CEO Alan Joyce indicated that “there are going to be opportunities to deploy those aircraft.”

“We do believe there is a need for that fleet and we do believe that it will generate cash,” stated Joyce during EUROCONTROL Aviation StraightTalk in early-February 2021.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9807089567184448}",neutral,0.9807089567184448,0

Airbus sites gear up for the A321XLR's Major Component Assembly phase - Airbus,"Tue, 02 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTAyLWFpcmJ1cy1zaXRlcy1nZWFyLXVwLWZvci10aGUtYTMyMXhscnMtbWFqb3ItY29tcG9uZW50LWFzc2VtYmx5LXBoYXNl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Industrialisation and parts production for the first A321XLR is underway across Airbus sites and its wider supply chain, paving the way for the Major Component Assembly of the first forward fuselage, centre and rear fuselage sections and the wings, to begin in 2021. By the start of this year, a large proportion of the engineering design drawings had been released.



“The production of components for the first A321XLR flight-test aircraft is progressing through the sites all across the world, for large and small components as well as systems,” notes Gary O’Donnell, Head of the A321XLR Programme. “In parallel, many parts are already being tested and demonstrated – on both the aircraft structure and on the systems side – to validate the functionality of all those first aircraft components.”





Bringing it all together



He added: “The production system in particular is now coming alive, with our teams receiving the design drawings from Airbus and the key risk-sharing design partners and bringing them into physical reality. This progress already is enabling Airbus’ factories across Europe and the UK to prepare their ‘pilot’ operations for the Major Component Assembly phase to begin later this year, and in turn, for the subsequent induction of the first completed Major Component Assembly's into the final assembly line at Hamburg in the second part of the year.”

New integral rear centre tank key to aircraft's extra-long-range performance

While all major sections of the A321XLR contain significant design changes versus the current A321neo/A321LR baseline aircraft, the Major Component Assembly with extensive design and manufacturing differences is the centre and aft fuselage. This is especially due to the centre and aft fuselage's totally new integral rear centre fuel tank and associated fuel management systems – which is key to the aircraft’s eXtra Long Range performance capability, while retaining operational commonality with the baseline A321neo.

Overall, the centre and aft fuselage’s production cycle is progressing: At Nantes, Airbus started the subassembly of the centre wing box in mid-November 2020. Once built, this major component will be delivered this year to Hamburg, where it will be integrated into the aft fuselage Major Component Assembly section. Meanwhile, Premium Aerotec Group in Augsburg Germany is completing the final parts for the rear centre tank and is readying the tooling and shop floor for the rear centre tank’s assembly. At Premium Aerotec Group’s other sites in Nordenham and Varel, various large centre and aft fuselage components are in production.

Pilot line to prepare for smooth ramp up

Airbus’ own factory in Hamburg, which will host the Major Component Assembly operations for the rear fuselage equipped with the new rear centre tank, is preparing the necessary jigs and tooling in a new dedicated pilot production line in ‘Hangar 260.’ This operation is deliberately decoupled from the rest of the A320 line, so that starting from next year this pilot line will enable a gradual ramp-up of the A321XLR’s new rear fuselage – to attain maturity without impacting Hamburg’s existing single-aisle production operations.



“The principle of this pilot line in Hamburg means that we can have a ‘stable factory,’” explained O’Donnell. “This will allow us to start ramping-up production of the A321XLR’s aft fuselage Major Component Assembly using longer cycle times to begin with, and with increased level of engineering and support – in particular to ensure the smooth integration of the new rear centre tank and its new fuel systems. Importantly, this new approach will also avoid us putting at risk the rest of single-aisle production. And then, once we’re happy that everything is mature and ‘up-to-speed,’ we can transfer it with confidence into the main production system.”



Regarding the aircraft’s nose and forward fuselage section, parts production is underway at Stelia Aerospace. When these parts are completed, they will be transported to Saint-Nazaire for the nose and forward fuselage Major Component Assembly stage.



Another key Major Component Assembly structure is the aircraft wing set, for which the UK Broughton team’s particular focus is the A321XLR’s new flap configuration. To this end, the associated tooling trials are in progress for the new ‘movables,’ being performed in conjunction with partners Spirit AeroSystems in Malaysia (inboard flap) and FACC in Austria (outboard flap). The wing’s more conventional fixed components, such as spars and stringers, are taking shape in Broughton and in the associated supply chain. Likewise, production is underway for the landing gear components (Safran, Collins and Triumph); fuel & inerting systems (Collins and Parker Aerospace); and the engine pylons (at Airbus’ dedicated production plant in St. Eloi, Toulouse). ‘Cabin and cargo’ systems are currently in the testing phase to validate the A321XLR’s extra-long-range passenger comfort elements.



Through exceptional international collaboration, the A321XLR is now on its way towards entry into service.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999630451202393}",neutral,0.9999630451202393,0

Airbus BLADE – Laminar Flow For Airliner Efficiency? - Mentour Pilot,"Fri, 05 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vbWVudG91cnBpbG90LmNvbS9haXJidXMtYmxhZGUtbGFtaW5hci1mbG93LWZvci1haXJsaW5lci1lZmZpY2llbmN5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Spyros Georgilidakis | February 5, 2021

In an age when efficiency is everything, the Airbus BLADE project showed how laminar flow could literally shape future airliners.

In Airbus parlance, BLADE stands for “Breakthrough Laminar Aircraft Demonstrator in Europe”. A bit of a stretch, terminologically speaking, but it gets the point across rather well. Laminar flow is about cutting the air like a blade, figuratively speaking, and Airbus hoped to do just that. But before we have a look at the test aircraft, let’s see what laminar flow is.

The term simply refers to how air behaves very close to the wing. Very early on in aviation, we learned that there is a boundary layer of air over the wing, that is usually turbulent. This turbulent layer creates drag. This drag increases with speed. The Airbus BLADE is a study in shaping and manufacturing a real-world wing section, that achieves laminar flow. In simple terms, we can think of ‘laminar’ to mean ‘smooth’. Laminar flow also applies to fluids.

In aviation, it is possible to achieve laminar/smooth flow with either ‘natural’ or ‘hybrid/induced’ methods. The Airbus BLADE is in the former category, whereby laminar flow happens thanks to the shape/smoothness of the wing. Other methods involve cutting microscopic holes in the upper surface of the wing. Then a pump draws air in through the holes, to get rid of the turbulent air, leaving only smooth/laminar flow. This works too, but adds weight and complexity.

Laminar Flow Testing Before The Airbus BLADE

Laminar flow tests in flight, are nothing new. The first such tests took place shortly before WWII! But unlike the Airbus BLADE, these laminar flow tests involved active/hybrid setups. They also involved structures placed on top of an existing wing. So the laminar flow surface was not structural to the wing. This was perfectly acceptable for those early tests, because the objective was to prove the technology.

One notable example of laminar flow testing that preceded the Airbus BLADE was NASA’s supersonic testing. This involved a modified version of the (already modified) F-16XL. But those tests were primarily about supersonic commercial aviation. This aircraft had an added structure on its left wing, with thousands or (in a later version) millions of tiny holes.

The aircraft sucked air through these small holes, using pump running on bleed-air from the engine. It worked well enough that this aircraft could accelerate supersonically without using afterburner. This boded well for then-future supersonic airliners, that wouldn’t use afterburners, either. Alas, the project didn’t find uses in civil/commercial aviation. However this could change soon.

But this is for supersonic travel. For most airliners, something simpler would be ideal. So Airbus wanted BLADE to show that natural laminar flow can work in practice, in a real aircraft. This meant making the laminar wing functional, with moving ailerons and, ideally, slats and spoilers as well. Airbus didn’t quite manage all of that. There are no slats in the front of the test wing sections, and obviously no spoilers, that far out into the wing. But each test section has an aileron.

The Test Aircraft

The BLADE laminar flow testbed is of course the Airbus A340-300. This is actually the very first prototype of that aircraft, and uses four CFM56 engines. Its outer wing sections now each sport a completely new wing structure, making use of composites. Pods on either side isolate them from the rest of the wing. And these pods also incorporate cameras and other flight test instrumentation (FTI).

The aircraft first flew in late 2017, beginning its test flight programme in early 2018. The wing profile has less sweep than the A330/A340 wing. That is because Airbus primarily wants BLADE to study laminar flow in short-haul, single-aisle aircraft. So, wing sweep for the BLADE airfoil is only 20°, whereas the rest of the wing is 30°. This makes it suitable to Mach 0.75, instead of the A330/A340’s more usual M0.82-0.84.

Airbus’ goal was for the BLADE sections to have laminar flow along 50% of the chord length (front-rear of the wing). Most wings achieve laminar flow only just behind the leading edge, before becoming turbulent. If the programme achieved this goal it would amount to an overall drag reduction of 8%. For a typical medium-haul 800nm flight, this means a fuel saving of 5%.

Airbus BLADE’s Laminar Flow Performance

At BLADE’s conclusion in April 2018, Airbus announced that its laminar flow results exceeded expectations. Not only was drag reduction lower by 10%, but the benefits were there at even higher speeds, of around Mach 0.78. Laminar flow remained stable even as the wing flexed in flight. Airbus had also taken the opportunity to test different materials on either side, for the leading edges. And they reported that both carbon composites and aluminium worked, with slight performance differences.

The technology is very promising, but there is a catch. Airbus has to determine how BLADE’s laminar flow changes with contamination: dirt and icing. We’ve already discussed how airlines are washing their aircraft, so they stay efficient. That’s all about airflow, and dirt, ice or even rain droplets can play a role.

Overall, Airbus declared BLADE to be a resounding success, with a lot of knowledge on laminar flow improving as a result. It is fair to say that the testing is not as impressive as NASA’s supersonic tests. But it could find use in airliners much sooner, and for more passengers.

After BLADE, Airbus reportedly wanted to see how laminar flow could work with morphing flaps and wings. This would eliminate separate parts, making for smoother surfaces. Unfortunately the pandemic put a halt on various research projects, including this one. But there is still time until Airbus or Boeing embark on a new single-aisle design!

Airbus calls it an “Xtra Large Bizjet.” But with significantly more interior space than large-cabin aircraft from competitors Gulfstream and Bombardier Global and, according to ACJ, lower operating costs, it might be more accurate to call the TwoTwenty an entirely new class of private business jet.

“When we started analyzing, we realized that unfortunately you can only have two out of three factors” among cost, range and space, says ACJ president Benoit Defforge. “We asked ourselves, ‘How do we find a platform, a product with no compromises, that includes all three?’”

More from Robb Report

The answer: a more fuel-efficient engine (the PW1500G), a lighter airframe and a “flexible cabin catalogue,” which has more than 100 interior designs and reduces costs compared to kitting out a custom cabin. The 786-square-foot interior is divided into six large living areas, with room for 18 passengers (compared with 100 to 133 on its commercial A220-100 sibling) to work, relax and dine. The layout can fit up to 10 fully reclining sleepers. Features such as a full bar, 55-inch 4K screens, an eight-seat dining table, a king-size bed and a private bathroom with rain shower suggest just how sprawling the interior really is.

With its 5,650-nautical-mile range, the TwoTwenty can fly nonstop from Los Angeles to London or New York to Moscow. ACJ upped the comfort factor with electro-chromatic windows, LED lighting and smart cabin controls. Defforge says the new Bizjet is “a very modern platform with the latest technology,” including Ku-band connectivity with twice the speed of current onboard Wi-Fi. The first pair of TwoTwenty aircraft are headed to Comlux’s completions facility for interior fit-out later this year.

Airbus A220 – Israir Eyeing A Complete Fleet Revamp? - Mentour Pilot,"Wed, 03 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vbWVudG91cnBpbG90LmNvbS9haXJidXMtYTIyMC1pc3JhaXItZXllaW5nLWEtY29tcGxldGUtZmxlZXQtcmV2YW1wL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Spyros Georgilidakis | February 3, 2021

Israir’s management is considering a complete fleet change for the airline, switching to the Airbus A220! This steals a page out of AirBaltic’s book.

Israir has had an eventful few years. After getting in financial trouble (largely outside the company itself), the airline recently got new owners. They include Rami Levy, a supermarket chain owner in Israel, and other well-known investors in the country. The company’s future looks a bit safer now. And it now seems that Israir could be in for a change to an Airbus A220 fleet.

We saw something similar with AirBaltic. This airline evolved over time, first as a regional carrier in the Baltic, then changing roles, with a 737 fleet. But they kept some of their smaller aircraft alongside those Boeings. That eventually changed, when a fleet of Airbus A220-300s replaced all aircraft – and now Israir is contemplating something remarkably similar.

While AirBaltic had 737s and Q400s, Israir has A320-200s and ATR72s. Different makes and models, but very similar roles. Population size comparisons between the two regions aren’t night and day, either. Israir is probably thinking of this, and the fact that AirBaltic has been singing the praises of its new Airbus A220 fleet.

What Is Attracting Israir To The Airbus A220?

Way back when Israir’s prospective new A220 was still the Bombardier CS300, its role was to beat the Airbus A320. A change of ownership changed its name, but the plane still is what it is: about 20% more efficient, per seat, than the A320-200. That’s what Israir has now. The only fly in the ointment, is that it has fewer seats. But is that really a problem?

The A320s the airline now has, all have a single-class layout with 174 seats. The Airbus A220-300 Israir is smiling on, has 135 to 145 seats (depending on which airline you ask) with the same layout. Whether this is really a problem or not, only the airline itself knows. But even Air France is replacing its A319s and A320s with this aircraft…

Of course this still leaves those ATR72s. Israir could order the Airbus A220-100, too, if they decide it’s necessary. Technically, this model isn’t as efficient as the -300, assuming both are full. But the airline performs domestic flights within the country, that could benefit from reduced capacity. Or they could readjust their operations, switching to a more ‘raw’ LCC model. Obviously having both variants isn’t really a logistical headache.

A Not Inconsiderable Current Fleet

But before we get too carried away with Israir’s prospective Airbus A220 fleet… let’s look at their current one. The airline has seven aircraft. Four are Airbus A320-200s. The other three are those ATR72s. And there are two noteworthy details, shared among all of them. Firstly, they are relatively young. Both types average at just over 10 years old.

Secondly, only two of them (one Airbus, one ATR) belong to lessors. The airline owns most of its small fleet. Given its recent financial woes, this is a big plus for the airline. It also means that they are bleeding less cash than many others out there, during the pandemic. And of course it could make Israir’s switch to new A220s, that much easier.

Israir CEO Uri Sirkis states that they updated these lease contracts with conditions allowing for a switch to Airbus A220s. The plan is to get seven A220s for its four A320s and three ATRs. He didn’t specify which Airbus A220 variant Israir would go for. The A220-300 must feature in the airline’s plans, but perhaps not exclusively so.

Speaking of lease agreements, we recently saw that Israir dry-leased simulator training, at Etihad Aviation Training, in Abu Dhabi. Etihad doesn’t have any Airbus A220 simulators, yet, for Israir. But it’s probably too early for that!","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9497193694114685}",neutral,0.9497193694114685,0
Airbus confident on FCAS contract progress despite 'challenging' negotiations - Flightglobal,"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vZGVmZW5jZS9haXJidXMtY29uZmlkZW50LW9uLWZjYXMtY29udHJhY3QtcHJvZ3Jlc3MtZGVzcGl0ZS1jaGFsbGVuZ2luZy1uZWdvdGlhdGlvbnMvMTQyNDg2LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is “very optimistic” that initial development activities can begin this year on the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) being jointly developed by France, Germany and Spain.

Currently the subject of intense negotiations between the nations and their respective industrial champions – Dassault, Airbus Defence & Space and Indra – the FCAS programme is designed to deliver a future manned fighter and unmanned remote carrier aircraft in the 2040s.

However, in recent weeks, German trade unionists have raised concerns that the planned workshare will cause an erosion of the country’s skills base. Dassault is leading the development of the future fighter, while Airbus is in charge of the remote carrier.

Describing the discussions as “complex and challenging”, Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury says the difficulties are to be expected given that the effort will shape Europe’s defence aerospace industry for the “next 30 or 40 years”.

“It is no surprise that it is a difficult moment to finalise the negotiations; we are very well advanced, but the last mile is probably the most difficult one,” he said during a full-year results briefing on 18 February.

Nonetheless, Faury says he is “very optimistic” of reaching an agreement allowing “preliminary development phase” work on the fighter and remote carrier to begin this year.

That so-called phase 1B activity would follow the phase 1A effort which has been taking place since February 2020 under an 18-month contract.

Faury says he has been “very impressed” with the pace of the FCAS programme, “as it was not existing three years ago”.

“It is a difficult moment in time, but it has been very fast,” he says.

Faury is similarly hopeful that agreements can be reached to the allow the development of two other multi-national programmes: the Eurodrone (France, Germany, Italy and Spain) and the Mark III upgrade for the Airbus Helicopters Tiger (France, Germany and Spain).

Such projects are “difficult to launch”, says Faury: “They are very important to organise and structure [correctly] right at the outset to ensure their success.”

Contracts for both are expected to be signed in 2021. Berlin’s coalition government on 5 February agreed to move ahead with the procurement and development of the Eurodrone. It anticipates a contract signature at the end of the first quarter or the beginning of the second.

Last year, Airbus Defence & Space said it expected deliveries of the medium-altitude, long-endurance unmanned air vehicle to start in 2028 – around three years later than envisaged when the project was first conceived in 2015.

However, the German defence ministry seems to indicate that this milestone may have slipped further.

“The aim is to conclude a contract in 2021. Then the first aircraft could presumably be delivered in 2029,” it says.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9939654469490051}",negative,0.9939654469490051,-1

Airbus mass 3D prints waveguide parts for latest Eutelsat satellites - 3D Printing Industry,"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vM2RwcmludGluZ2luZHVzdHJ5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1tYXNzLTNkLXByaW50cy13YXZlZ3VpZGUtcGFydHMtZm9yLWxhdGVzdC1ldXRlbHNhdC1zYXRlbGxpdGVzLTE4NDYxOS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aerospace manufacturer Airbus has 3D printed a total of 500 components for Eutelsat’s Eurostar Neo series of relay satellites.

By additive manufacturing the radio frequency (RF) parts, including multi-waveguide blocks and switch assembly networks, Airbus was able to reduce the lead time and costs of their assembly. Once fitted to Eutelsat’s Hotbird 13F and 13G satellites, the parts will effectively reinforce the firm’s broadcasting services in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa.

“This is recognised as the first large-scale deployment of RF products using the ALM (Additive Layer Manufacturing) process,” said Gareth Penlington, Hotbird Payload Manager at Airbus. “It puts us in an industry-leading position for the technology’s application in producing radio frequency components.”

Airbus’ additive aerospace prowess

For over five years now, Airbus has utilized 3D printing to design and manufacture both prototype and end-use parts, deploying them within different areas of its business. For instance, the company has consistently used the technology to boost its core aviation division, 3D printing A350 components as well as improving its aircraft maintenance program.

To further its application of additive within end-use scenarios, Airbus has also engaged in aerospace R&D. Working with software developer Sigma Labs, the firm has validated metal PBF printing for serial aerospace production, while more recently, it partnered with Satair to create what it claimed to be the “first certified metal printed flying spare part.”

Elsewhere, Airbus has set its sights even higher, targeting orbital satellite applications of its technologies. By collaborating with 3D printer manufacturer 3D Systems, for example, the company has previously fabricated redesigned RF filters for relay antennas, improving their surface topology, while reducing their weight and expense in the process.

3D printing Eutelsat’s Eurostar Neo

While Airbus has created parts for Eutelsat’s antennae before, 3D printing elements of the firm’s 172B satellite back in 2017, its latest project is noteworthy because it has now entered into high-volume production. As part of the program, a total of 500 waveguides and assembly networks are being fully-manufactured at Airbus’ Portsmouth base, from concept design right through to final qualification.

Once signed-off, the components will be fitted to two of Eutelsat’s ‘Hotbird’ spacecraft, and launched into Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to support the firm’s communication services. The company claims that its satellite boasts “increased efficiency and performance” compared to other platforms, and that its “payload-centric design” effectively increases mission capacity.

Airbus has already completed the first batch of 3D printed parts for the project and shipped them to its Defence and Space facility in Toulouse, France, for assembly. In Portsmouth, meanwhile, the company is still constructing the second Hotbird communications module, where it’s expected to undergo testing later this month.

Stratospheric 3D printed parts

Using 3D printing to create optimized satellite parts is becoming an increasingly common application of the technology, and several firms have done so in the last few months alone.

Solid-state metal 3D printing specialist Fabrisonic has deployed its proprietary UAM technology to create more efficient heat exchangers for NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL). The upgraded devices are designed to better regulate the temperature of satellites operating in the cold vacuum of space.

3D printing service provider 3DCeram has also helped French Space Agency (CNES) spin-out Anywaves to produce ceramic antennas for its small satellites. 3DCeram effectively provided consultancy on the design and feasibility of the parts, while Anywaves is now considering whether to go ahead with their serial production.

Elsewhere, scientists at the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech) have worked with material provider RUSAL to 3D print casings for the Yarilo satellite. Together, the two organizations have developed a novel aluminum, and used it to create optimized parts for weather-monitoring Cubesats.

With the beginning of 2021, the air transport industry expects market demand to improve with the arrival of new COVID-19 vaccines. Despite that hope, most airlines have had a great part of their fleet grounded while operating half of their normal network throughout 2020, which has negatively affected the aircraft manufacturers which are directly dependent on airlines needing new aircraft.

Despite the flimsiness of market demand, Airbus managed to deliver 21 aircraft to 15 different carriers during the month of January. However, the manufacturer did not receive a single new order, reflective of the current market conditions. In January 2020, the European manufacturer delivered 31 aircraft, and it also received 274 net orders.

Airbus closed 2020 delivering a total of 89 aircraft in December, trying to bolster its year-end numbers with a rash of deliveries to cap off the month. Of the models distributed in January, the majority were Airbus A320 — four ceos and 12 neos — followed by three Airbus A220s, one A330neo and one Airbus A350 XWB.

Delta Airlines was the airline that received the most aircraft, taking delivery of four A321ceos and two A220s. Air China received four A320neos and SAS another two units of the same model. Shenzen Airlines, Uganda Airlines, American Airlines, flynas, Turkish Airlines, Air Canada, China Eastern, Vietnam Airlines and a private owner were the other recipients of the new Airbus aircraft. The European manufacturer still has a delivery backlog of 7,163 aircraft and received no cancellations during the last month.

Airbus closed 2020 with 566 total deliveries, a 34% reduction compared to 2019. The manufacturer adapted its delivery plan in April as a response to COVID-19. Last year, it received 268 net orders — equalling orders minus cancelations — 500 fewer than in 2019, which brought up the backlog to 7,184 aircraft. Asia-Pacific was the continent with most deliveries — 25.8% — followed by Europe — 20.8% — and North America — 15.2%.

Focus on the A321XLR

With the negative news of the aviation world, Airbus is focused on the construction of the A321XLR. Last Thursday, the manufacturer began its assembly program in its factory in Hamburg, Germany.

“Airbus’ factories in Europe and the United Kingdom are preparing themselves for the first assembly process that will be happening at the end of the year,” said Gary O’Donnell, program director for the A321XLR. “The objective of this program is to establish a production line in Hamburg that allows us to have a stable factory for this model.”

The Airbus A321XLR will be assembled in Hamburg with pieces received from Nantes and Toulouse, France; Augsburg , Germany and Broughton, U.K.

“The production line will allow us to increase the assembly of the main fuselage components using longer cycle times in the beginning, with a higher level of engineering and support,” O’Donnell said. “It is important to mention that this new process will avoid risking the rest of the narrow-body production. Once that we have checked the process, we will implement it with confidence in the main production line.”

News

Emma Helfrich Technology Editor Military Embedded Systems

Airbus image. FRANCE. The French defense procurement agency (DGA) has awarded Thales and Airbus a contract for the new joint tactical signals intelligence (SIGINT) system to upgrade the French forces' critical signals monitoring, direction finding, and spectrum analysis capabilities.

The 10-year contract will equip the three armed forces with a common information system and set of sensors and is designated as a high-impact program (PEM1), alongside CONTACT and SCORPION, under France's defense spending plan. This joint tactical SIGINT system will aim to provide French armed forces command with an expanded tactical electronic support measures (ESM) capability.

According to officials, the tactical SIGINT program will upgrade the electronic warfare capabilities of front-line units, providing a set of high-performance portable or vehicle-mounted assets compatible with the latest communications technologies.

Thales will draw on the SIGINT experience developed by COHORTE (the current French Army tactical SIGINT system), MINREM2 (French Navy SIGINT system), ARCHANGE3 (French Air Force new-generation SIGINT aircraft), and CLOVIS4 (strategic interministerial communications localization project). Thales will also build on its capabilities in end-to-end communications, radio communications, and communications security.

Airbus will provide its expertise in strategic ELINT systems, drawing on programs such as RAMSES (strategic radio and satellite communications information system) and PARADOS (radio signal acquisition sensor).","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.839255154132843}",neutral,0.839255154132843,0
"France's Macron floats pursuing Airbus-Boeing settlement in call with Biden, source says - CNBC","Wed, 10 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMTAvZnJhbmNlcy1tYWNyb24tZmxvYXRzLXB1cnN1aW5nLWFpcmJ1cy1ib2Vpbmctc2V0dGxlbWVudC1pbi1jYWxsLXdpdGgtYmlkZW4tc291cmNlLXNheXMtLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French President Emmanual Macron speaks on the telephone with U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France November 10, 2020.

Neither country's official readout of the call included a mention of the long-simmering trade dispute that spans back to Biden's days serving as a senator and chairing the Foreign Relations Committee.

Biden, according to the person familiar with the call, said the relevant teams would follow up but was noncommittal on the outcome. Efforts to reach a resolution have been underway for some time.

French President Emmanuel Macron suggested to President Joe Biden two weeks ago that the countries seek a negotiated settlement in the Boeing-Airbus conflict over aircraft manufacturing that has lasted nearly two decades, according to a person familiar with the matter.

""Airbus supports all necessary actions to create a level-playing field and continues to support the EU's commitment to finding a negotiated settlement of this long-standing dispute to avoid lose-lose tariffs,"" Airbus said in an e-mailed statement.

The White House could not be reached for comment before publication. A representative for Boeing didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

""We know there is great interest in resolving the Boeing-Airbus dispute on both sides of the Atlantic, and USTR looks forward to working with our European allies to find an outcome that levels the playing field once Ambassador [Katherine] Tai is confirmed,"" a spokesperson for the U.S. Trade Representative told CNBC.

Since 2004, Boeing and Airbus have been embroiled in a legal battle over what each side sees as unfair tax subsidies provided by Washington state and the European Union.

The World Trade Organization has ruled favorably for each side at different stages, issuing orders for the United States and European Union to offset their rival's benefit by levying tariffs on a total of $11.5 billion in goods. Each side has since moved to roll back the tax subsidies at the heart of the dispute.

""There's really nothing left but to reach a deal,"" said Marjorie Chorlins, senior vice president of European affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ""The last administration made a good faith effort to resolve these issues but didn't close the deal.""

Beyond that, the Covid pandemic has soured demand for air travel and, by extension, purchases of large civil aircraft – further exacerbating the impact on two manufacturers that have incurred hundreds of millions of dollars in legal fees since the dispute began.

The floating of a potential settlement by Macron signals how high a priority it is for France and the EU as they eye a reset of trans-Atlantic relations under the new administration.

""Our aim is to find solutions to our ongoing trade disputes, including on Airbus/Boeing,"" said Sophie Dirven, a spokesperson for the European Commission.

Biden, likewise, has pushed to reset diplomatic relationships with allies following the contentious Trump years.

The decision on whether to move forward with a settlement would land on the plate of the USTR, which had previously enacted tariffs on $7.5 billion in European goods, including German machinery, Italian cheese and French wines.

In recent days, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has announced a slate of staff appointments as it awaits a confirmation hearing for USTR nominee Katherine Tai, expected to take place the week of Feb. 22 at the earliest.

Officials have raised the issue with other Cabinet members who have been confirmed.

In a Jan. 28 phone call between Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, Le Maire ""insisted in particular on the very penalizing nature of the sanctions for French winegrowers,"" according to the readout from Paris.

Does COMAC C919 need to compete with Airbus A320neo or Boeing 737 MAX? - AeroTime,"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjcyMjAtYzkxOS1hMzIwbmVvLTczN21heC1jb21wZXRpdGlvbtIBTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjcyMjAtYzkxOS1hMzIwbmVvLTczN21heC1jb21wZXRpdGlvbi9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ever since the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) presented the C919 in January 2009, comparisons with the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 aircraft families have followed the Chinese narrow-body. Rightfully so, as the trio of aircraft are competing for the same market space, carrying between 160 and 180 passengers on short-to-medium-haul itineraries. Comparisons only increased as Airbus announced the A320neo and, subsequently, Boeing announced the 737 MAX.

China is an aviation market like no other country, not only in terms of its projected growth in passenger numbers but also the way that the government plays a role in it. With the authorities spearheading various projects and prioritizing homemade technology, the competition for the largest aviation market between the A320neo, the 737 MAX and the C919 might be skewed towards the Chinese narrow-body jet – which begs the question, does the C919 even need to compete against the two Western-made single-aisle aircraft?

Major market

At the same time, if the tightly-controlled market is being skewed towards locally-made products, why would Airbus and Boeing compete?

The answer perhaps lies in the market outlooks that the two manufacturers have provided.

According to Airbus Global Market Forecast (GMF), the manufacturer predicted that China alone would need 7,400 new aircraft between 2018 and 2037. Out of that number, the country will require around 6,100 typical narrow-body aircraft, with an additional 870 smaller wide-body or long-range single-aisle aircraft. All in all, the European manufacturer indicated that demand from China would represent 19% of the total demand for new aircraft in the 20-year period between 2018 and 2037.

“China is one of the most powerful growth engines of global air transport. It will become the world’s number one aviation market in the very near future,” stated Airbus Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) Christian Scherer in November 2018. While the world was much different back then, including no pandemic to create the worst travel demand in history, according to International Air Transport Association (IATA), the future demand for aircraft is believed to remain more or less the same in China.

Boeing’s newest commercial market outlook aims to confirm that belief. The US planemaker outlined that despite the COVID-19 induced crisis, “China has demonstrated a relative advantage compared to other countries in its economy’s ability to recover,” read the market outlook, published in October 2020.

“The largest domestic market is advantageous to Chinese carriers, helping them rebound more quickly than airlines in other countries,” concluded Boeing. Overall, the manufacturer predicted that the country would need around 6,450 single-aisle aircraft, in addition to 380 regional jets and 1,590 wide-body planes. Globally, Boeing expects that airlines will require 32,270 single-aisle aircraft. As a result, in the next 20 years, China is predicted to take around 20% of the total single-aisle deliveries.

Thus, the duopoly will not only compete against one another but also against the C919. COMAC intends to finally deliver the narrow-body in late-2021, despite the fact that the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) has yet to certify the aircraft.

Airbus and Boeing position in China

Both members of the duopoly have established their own major facilities in the country.

Airbus opened its Final Assembly Line (FAL) in Tianjin, China, in 2008. At first, the assembly line was capable of delivering the Airbus A320 family aircraft. Since 2017, the site also has also welcomed an Airbus A330 Completion and Delivery Centre (C&DC), and in Q1 2021, the Tianjin facility is scheduled to deliver an A350 from the C&DC.

“China will become a very important strategic market for Airbus,” George Xu, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Airbus China was quoted as saying in October 2020. A year prior, Airbus and Chinese officials signed the deal to increase the manufacturer’s presence in the country, including the inclusion of the A350 into the C&DC, when the French President Emmanuel Macron visited China in November 2019.

Meanwhile, Boeing delivered its first and only 737 MAX from its Zhoushan, China Completion and Delivery Center to Air China in December 2018. Established together with COMAC, the facility was limited to work on the 737 MAX’s interior at the time of its first delivery, with the main assembly work in Renton, Washington, United States.

AeroTime News approached Boeing and the company’s representatives in Zhoushan for a comment on the facility’s current status and future.

However, China was also the first authority to ground the Boeing 737 MAX following its second fatal crash in Ethiopia in March 2019. While authorities across the globe, including the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), have begun to unground the aircraft, China’s CAAC is in no hurry to do so. The authority’s director Feng Zhenglin noted that in order for the aircraft to be allowed to fly commercially in the country once again, it would have to meet three conditions. First things first, the CAAC needs to certify the changes, followed by pilots receiving proper training and finally, the authority indicated that effective changes needed to be made to rectify errors found during the two fatal accident investigations.

“Based on these three principles, we have not set a timetable for Boeing 737 MAX’s return to service here. As long as these conditions are met, we’re happy to see the MAX return to service in China,” Feng was quoted as saying by Reuters in October 2020. A month later, industry sources indicated that the 737 MAX could return as soon as March 2021, according to AviationWeek.

Political flavor

At the same time, all three single-aisle aircraft, including the manufacturers behind them, are entangled in political quarrels, with outcomes sliced with double-edged knives.

Much like the CAAC is in no hurry to release the 737 MAX into service, the US was in no hurry to allow COMAC to make progress in its plans. Shortly before the former US President Donald Trump was set to leave the Oval Office, he added several Chinese companies to a blacklist of companies that have alleged ties to the Chinese military, including COMAC. US individuals are prohibited from investing in blacklisted companies, however, that should not come as a threat to the manufacturer as its shares are not publicly traded in the US. A problem would arise if COMAC were to be added to the Entity List, which the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) described as a list of entities that are “subject to specific license requirements for the export, re-export and/or transfer (in-country) of specified items.” If COMAC were added to the list, the suppliers would have to obtain special licenses from the BIS to conduct business with the Chinese company.

With US-based manufacturers, including CFM International, Rockwell Collins and Honeywell providing such parts as the engines, avionics and flight controls, respectively, to the C919, COMAC’s addition to the Entity List could delay the narrow-body for a long time. Fortunately, the newly-sworn in US President Joe Biden indicated a change of tone in terms of international relations between the two countries.

“I’m not going to do it the way Trump did. We are going to focus on the international rules of the road,” stated Biden in an interview with CBS. Still, the US was preparing itself for “extreme competition” against China, added the 46th President of the US.

Nevertheless, subtle hints of politics could follow the C919 throughout its operational history.

“There is clearly an element of airlines being “asked” to take the aircraft as quite frequently, those same airlines are “asked” to take Airbus or Boeing aircraft as part of much larger trade deals,” commented to AeroTime News John Grant, chief analyst at OAG. “That is where COMAC may play a role in the soft politics of aviation with perhaps African nations seeking Chinese investment and support taking the aircraft for their national carriers to operate,” he added.

According to the analyst, it is highly unlikely that the C919 would dent either the A320neo or the 737 MAX market share, especially on the international stage. While some opportunities could follow due to the aforementioned political soft power, COMAC aircraft “lack that market confidence outside of China,” added Grant.

“In performance terms – payload-range and operating economics, I have no doubt that on paper the C919 can look competitive compared to Max and A320neo. However, there is always a third leg to the stool of any successful aircraft program and that is manufacturer and product support,” in a comment to AeroTime News explained Rob Morris, Global Head of Consultancy at Cirium. “Airbus and Boeing have spent 50 years building worldwide and word class customer support networks and each continues to innovate and support their operators and customers today. Of course, there are always things each could do better but they have built trust globally which enables them to continue to sell aircraft in high volume,” continued Morris.

“By contrast, COMAC has no track record and indeed a history of development delays with both ARJ21 and now, the C919, which means the market has not yet built that trust.”

Seemingly, the A320neo, B737 MAX and C919 trio can co-exist, yet at the same time, the Western-made aircraft would still outrun the Chinese narrow-body in China.

“Cirium Fleet Forecast predicted deliveries of around 500 C919 over the next ten years, virtually all of which we expect to be for customers in China. During that same period we are forecasting around 5,500 737 Max and 6,300 A320neo family deliveries globally, including 1,300 and 1,200 respectively in China,” added Morris. Despite the fact that the C919 has great opportunities in its domestic market, “we still expect Airbus and Boeing to dominate the market in China for a long while yet.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996464252471924}",neutral,0.9996464252471924,0
