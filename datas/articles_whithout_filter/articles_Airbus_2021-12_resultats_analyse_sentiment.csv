First A321XLR development aircraft undergoes final assembly - Airbus,"Mon, 06 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTEyLWZpcnN0LWEzMjF4bHItZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtYWlyY3JhZnQtdW5kZXJnb2VzLWZpbmFsLWFzc2VtYmx50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The very first A321XLR flight test aircraft, MSN11000, took a major step forward this week in becoming reality. This is the first of three planned development aircraft which will perform the flight testing and Type Certification programme -- starting in 2022, to pave the way for series production and entry into service in 2023.

The structural completion of MSN11000 in the Final Assembly Line (FAL) in Hamburg follows the recent assembly and equipping of the Major Component Assemblies (MCAs) and their subsequent delivery and introduction on schedule into the FAL in November. These MCAs notably included (but were not limited to): the nose and forward fuselage, delivered from Saint Nazaire; the centre and aft fuselage assembled in Hamburg; the wings from Broughton; the landing gears supplied by Safran, and the vertical and horizontal tailplanes from Stade and Getafe respectively.

While other Airbus FAL locations will eventually be producing A321XLRs to fulfil the type’s impressively large customer order-book, Hamburg has been chosen to ‘pilot’ this new variant into series production. This is starting with the three development flight test aircraft – now in various stages of completion there.

Michael Menking, Head of the A320 Family Programme explains: “For the A321 Family, we have started all the head-of-versions in Hamburg -- the real first ones -- and it is our intention to build these aircraft also at the other sites.”

He adds: “We are currently on the way to also have the A321XLR delivered out of other Single Aisle FALs. So it is important for sure that all the teams learn from the experience in Hamburg so we can bring this knowledge to the other facilities. This is also what we are doing with the A320 Family Airspace cabin which we started in Hamburg.”

Of the four A320 Family assembly lines in Hamburg, the one which is processing the first A321XLR is referred to as “FAL Line 2”, which is inside the “Hangar-9” building. The subsequent two A321XLR development aircraft – MSN11058 and MSN11080 – will follow in due course from the same assembly line.

Coming together in the FAL Hangar-9

Once all the MCAs for the initial -XLR aircraft had reached the FAL they subsequently came together at a series of “Stations” to create a whole recognisable aircraft. The journey through these stations took approximately four weeks and comprised the following:

At Station 42/43, the open and separate aft and forward fuselage sections offered the accessibility to receive their fully equipped monuments (galleys, lavatories).



Subsequent “join-up” of these fuselage sections and final installation of the monuments took place at Station 41. Here over 3,000 rivets joined the forward and rear fuselage sections. Importantly, these fuselage sections contained the A321XLR’s vital new enabler: its special Rear-Centre-Tank (RCT) produced by Premium Aerotec. The RCT holds the extra 12,900 litres of fuel needed for its very long range 4,700nm capability. The XLR’s lower fuselage also contains a larger waste-water tank for the extra long flights. In addition, the interior furnishing (floor panels, cargo loading system and cockpit linings) and cabin electrical systems were also fitted at Station 41.



With the above stage completed, the teams in the FAL carefully raised the whole fuselage section by overhead crane and then lowered it into a jig at the next station: Station 40. This was the most visually impressive stage, where they physically positioned the awaiting wing and landing gear assemblies right up to their new fuselage with sub-millimetric precision.



Around 2,400 rivets were then used to ensure a robust connection of both wings to the fuselage. Here the aircraft also received its Toulouse-made engine pylons. Another milestone at this station was the functional electrical “power-on”. From then on the aircraft no longer needed a crane, since it could be pulled on its own wheels to the next station.



Station 35 saw the installation of the horizontal and vertical tailplanes (the HTP from Getafe in Spain, and the VTP from Stade in Germany), the tail cone, inner flaps, main landing gear doors, radome, weather radar, air ducts, air conditioning system, water system, fuel-system (which is modified for the RCT on -XLR), belly fairing, the APU, and all the passenger and cargo doors. The hydraulic system “power on” was also performed here, as well as the installation of cabin linings, hat racks, passenger service channel and cargo compartment panels. Finally the fuel tanks were sealed at Station 35.

At the time of writing, testing and cabin installation has taken place at Station 25. This comprised: fuselage pressurisation testing; HTP final rigging; interior furnishing (including emergency lights, stowage etc); cabin systems tests (illumination, emergency lighting, audio, video systems etc.); and system-tests (avionics, communication and navigation tests, tank leakage tests).

The last FAL phase will be at Station 23 for the final testing and interior finishing. This includesinstallation of some seats for the flight-test-engineers, main landing gear testing, and overall cabin testing.

After having passed through all these stations, the very first A321XLR will have transformed from a collection of separate parts into a real aircraft, and roll-out of Hangar-9 on its newly installed landing gear.

Gerd Weber, Head of A320 Family Value Stream Management & FALs points out: “In the final assembly of the A321XLR aircraft there is not a big variation compared with the other A321 aircraft. The major differences in the -XLR are seen in the ‘pre-FAL’, at section assembly level, where the RCT is installed, for example.”

He adds: “This test aircraft has a partial cabin installed to leave space for all the required flight test equipment. What is also specific for this first A321XLR aircraft is that there is a lot of documentation work to be done, especially for flight test installation, which is very different from our serial process. So this requires a special focus by all the teams in closing the documentation and dealing with any discrepancies.”

Next steps

From here MSN11000 will enter a working party to install its sophisticated flight-test-instrumentation (FTI) suite followed by installation of its CFM LEAP engines and nacelles. The engines will then be tested for the first time, as well as the landing gear retraction mechanism and the door fairings, followed by an overall quality inspection of the aircraft.

The next production step – the application of the aircraft’s external paint scheme – is the ‘icing on the cake’, shortly before the aircraft is handed over to the flight-test teams. Eager to take possession of their new machine for the first time, they will activate and run through a series of ground tests on all the systems, flight controls, engines and the APU. Then all being well, they will perform the taxiing runs and of course the first flight of the -XLR, which will take place next year. Stay tuned!","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999969005584717}",neutral,0.9999969005584717,0
Air France-KLM orders 100 Airbus A320neo family aircraft | AIR FRANCE KLM - Air France KLM,"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJmcmFuY2VrbG0uY29tL2VuL2Fpci1mcmFuY2Uta2xtLW9yZGVycy0xMDAtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjBuZW8tZmFtaWx5LWFpcmNyYWZ0LXB1cmNoYXNlLXJpZ2h0cy1hZGRpdGlvbmFsLTYwLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWtsbdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On December 16, 2021, the Air France-KLM Board of Directors made the decision to move forward on the Group’s goal to improve its economic and environmental performance through the introduction of next generation aircraft. In doing so, the Group also demonstrated its ability to leverage purchasing synergies.

1. Firm order for 100 Airbus A320neo family aircraft - with purchase rights for 60 additional aircraft, to renew the fleets of KLM and Transavia Netherlands, and to renew and expand the fleet of Transavia France.

The order covers Airbus A320neo and Airbus A321neo aircraft. The first deliveries are expected in the second half of 2023.

Benefiting from the latest technological innovations, the A320neo family aircraft offer the best performance in their category for the network needs of the Group’s airlines. Compared to previous generation aircraft, they offer a unit cost reduction of more than 10%, as well as a 15% reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Their noise footprint is also 50% lower.

Fleet renewal is the first lever to cut CO2 emissions, with immediate effect. Alongside the use of sustainable aviation fuels and eco-piloting, it is one of the pillars of the Group's decarbonization trajectory, which aims for net zero emissions by 2050, and -50% CO2 emissions per passenger/km by 2030, i.e. -15% in absolute terms.

These aircraft will operate medium-haul routes in Europe, notably from Amsterdam-Schiphol - KLM's global hub and Transavia Netherlands' main base, and from Paris-Orly, Transavia France's main base.

Details of the cabin configuration will be announced at a later date.

2. Signature of a Letter of Intent (LOI) for the purchase of 4 Airbus A350F Full Freighter aircraft – with purchase rights for 4 additional aircraft, to increase cargo capacity at Air France.

In the context of a steady and sustainable growth of demand for air cargo, this order would increase Air France-KLM’s cargo capacity.

Air France-KLM would be among the launch operators of the A350F Full Freighter.

This order would come with full substitution rights to Airbus A350 passenger aircraft, which constitute the new spearhead of the Air France long-haul fleet. The airline currently operates 12 of the 38 aircraft of the type on order.

Benjamin Smith, CEO of the Air France-KLM Group, said: ""These evolutionary orders will position our Group airlines on the path to improved performance while accelerating our decarbonization trajectory. This is a major step forward for KLM, Transavia and Air France, which will operate the best aircraft available for their network needs. The outstanding performances of the A320neo family and of the A350F Full-Freighter, which are quieter, more fuel-efficient and more cost-effective aircraft, make them the best choices for the long-term growth of our fleet. They will be instrumental in reaching our ambitious targets, including zero net CO2 emissions by 2050.”

As of December 15, 2021, Air France-KLM operated a fleet of 502 aircraft to over 300 destinations worldwide.

The last ever A380 superjumbo is delivered to Emirates - CNN,"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvbGFzdC1hMzgwLWVtaXJhdGVzL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSATlodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi90cmF2ZWwvYXJ0aWNsZS9sYXN0LWEzODAtZW1pcmF0ZXM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

The last Airbus A380 ever made has been delivered to Emirates, marking the end of an era for the superjumbo that was once touted as the future of aviation until airlines cast it aside for smaller aircraft.

The huge double-deck aircraft, call sign A6-EVS, arrived in London on Thursday and will soon be entering into commercial service.

Beloved by many pilots and travelers, the A380’s days have been numbered since 2019 when Airbus announced plans to cease its production in the face of disappointing demand for its flagship airplane.

Still, the age of the superjumbo isn’t entirely over – the last A380 is also the 123rd A380 to join Emirates, while other carriers, including British Airways and Singapore Airlines, also still operate superjumbos in their fleet.

The appeal of the superjumbo

The Final Emirates A380

The A380 is the largest mass-produced passenger aircraft ever developed. Its hefty size – it can accommodate up to 853 passengers in roomy surroundings – and quiet inflight experience are among the reasons it’s become so popular among passengers.

However the aircraft was never a hit with airlines in the way Airbus hoped. Costly to run, the A380 is usually only viable on long-distance routes. It’s also less environmentally friendly than more modern, smaller aircraft models.

Over 2020 and 2021, the pandemic’s impact on the aviation industry saw most of the world’s A380 fleet grounded. Lufthansa’s decision to park its A380 turned into the German carrier permanently retiring the superjumbos, while AirFrance also retired its last A380.

Still, airlines seem to recognize the A380’s enduring popularity, and it’s been slowly reintroduced to some carriers’ schedules, following a pandemic pause.

As Siva Govindasamy, Singapore Airlines’ global public affairs head put it in October, when announcing plans to reinstate the aircraft: “Some people just book the A380 specifically to fly on it.”

And while Airbus won’t be making any more superjumbos, travelers should be able to to enjoy the A380 experience for years to come.

Upon delivery of the new aircraft in London, Tim Clark, Emirates’ president, said in a statement that the A380 will “remain Emirates’ flagship product for the coming years” calling the aircraft “a vital pillar of our network plans.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9647825956344604}",neutral,0.9647825956344604,0

Once seen as the future of travel, the world's biggest aircraft turned into a flop. But for the plane-maker, it was still worth the effort.

Sir Tim Clark, the president of Emirates airlines, had intended to be in Hamburg this week to attend a historic event — the last delivery of an Airbus A380. It's the 251st from the series, and the last one ever built.

A total of 123 have been ordered by the carrier from Dubai. Without all these orders, the program would have been shut down years ago. Instead, it was announced in 2019 that production would end in 2021.

But the 72-year-old Clark, an industry legend, has not had it easy with his favorite aircraft. Nobody believed as steadfastly in the A380 as he. Clark had reckoned early on that the world's biggest aircraft, with room for up to 615 passengers in the Emirates version, was tailor-made for its business model of connecting the entire world — via Dubai.

Initially, he even went so far as to get cabin mock-ups, constructed at the airline's own expense, to show Airbus that it was possible to install two showers in the front of the upper deck, exactly where he wanted them.

Only later did Airbus and its engine manufacturers reject the idea to develop an improved version with more efficient engines. It's these four thirsty engines that made the A380 uneconomical for most operators long ago.

No celebrations planned

Clark was not able to celebrate the final A380 delivery with the fanfare he had hoped for. Airbus rejected the idea of celebrating the end of a program, and then the pandemic situation in Germany rendered useless all efforts toward an event.

""I said to Airbus' CEO Guillaume Faury: 'This thing has got real life and legs for us, this is not a funeral, just the last of these great airplanes,'"" Clark told DW. ""And we will fly the A380 as a very potent aircraft until the mid-2030s, so we've got 14 to 15 years before we retire them.""

But now the last A380 will be transferred unceremoniously on Thursday from the Airbus factory in Hamburg-Finkenwerder to Dubai. This will give Emirates a total of 118 service-ready A380s, about half of which are currently in deep storage waiting for better times for the commercial aviation industry.

It seems that the pandemic was the last straw for giant aircraft. Besides the end of the A380, the Boeing 747 program will also stop production in 2022 after more than half a century.

Giant aircraft back in fashion?

In the fall of 2021, however, passenger numbers shot up so rapidly that some airlines were quickly able to deploy their A380 fleets. These aircraft were then able to solve short-term capacity problems.

It gave giant aircraft a new lease on life. British Airways, for example, has been flying four of its dozen A380s since November. Singapore Airlines, having been part of the giant's world premiere in 2007, also put some of its biggest airliners back in service on the London-Sydney route, among other destinations.

At Qatar Airways, the unexpected reversal of fortunes for the A380 represented a U-turn. At one point, the company operated 10 of them. But in May, Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker publicly declared: ""Looking back, it was the biggest mistake we did, to purchase A380s.""

""We grounded the A380 and never wanted to fly it again, because it is a very inefficient aircraft in fuel burn and emissions, and I don't think there will be a market for it in the foreseeable future,"" he added.

""I know the passengers love it, it's a very quiet and smart airplane, but the damage it does to the environment should be priority and not the comfort,"" he said.

But after a shortage of aircraft cropped up due to problems with the more modern Airbus A350s, the CEO announced in late September that ""[u]nfortunately we have no alternative but to fly the A380 again.""

Since November, five of Qatar's gray giants have taken to the skies once again.

Money down the drain?

In total, the A380 program cost an estimated €30 billion ($33.9 billion) — and most of that money came from European taxpayers. But why was it a flop, at least in economic terms?

""We were blindsided by the engine manufacturers,"" said John Leahy, a legendary Airbus aircraft salesman now in retirement, in an interview.

The producers had said they would come up with improved engine systems. Yet those engines were developed secretly and deployed first in the smaller and more efficient 737 Dreamliner from rival Boeing.

Beyond those factors, the main problem was the long delay in bringing the A380 to market. This delay painfully demonstrated how Airbus partners in Germany and France were not on the same page. At the time, they worked on different and incompatible IT systems.

SARS and a financial crisis

When the A380 finally went into service in 2008, that timing was unfortunate: the SARS pandemic of 2002-2003 was followed by the global financial crisis that led to a collapse in demand for big aircraft.

The market at that point demanded smaller, more efficient aircraft that were capable of flying nonstop long-haul routes that were economical, even from secondary airports.

The smaller Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 ended up as the aircraft providing direct flights between cities like Düsseldorf and Tokyo, or Munich and Bogota. Passengers were happy to avoid big-hub airports, and Airbus lost out with its mass transportation mammoths.

Industry experts and Airbus remain sure of one thing: Despite it being an economic failure, the effort to build the A380 wasn't entirely in vain. Most importantly, Airbus had been forced to act as a corporate entity for the first time, and the learning effect was paramount.

""All the fiasco around the A380 made the A350 definitely the best airplane program we've ever had,"" said John Leahy, once the company's most senior salesman.

The manufacturer was able to finally get rid of ""the many little kingdoms"" in partner countries. But ""spending €25 or €30 billion on the A380 just to get that education seems like a very inefficient way,"" Leahy said.

Special Delivery: Airbus sends Breeze's brand new A220 straight to TPA - Tampa International Airport,"Tue, 28 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy50YW1wYWFpcnBvcnQuY29tL3NwZWNpYWwtZGVsaXZlcnktYWlyYnVzLXNlbmRzLWJyZWV6ZXMtYnJhbmQtbmV3LWEyMjAtc3RyYWlnaHQtdG8tdHBhL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"b2

Airport operations specialist Jordan Gottlieb spends plenty of time around the runways of TPA. He’s seen every type plane from each airline that takes off and lands here.

But on a recent Friday, Dec. 17, there was an extra excitement in the air.

Jordan had his DSLR ready to go for a special landing scheduled for mid-afternoon.

It was Breeze Airways' brand new aircraft, N203BZ, an A220 on just its fourth flight ever coming in from the Airbus assembly plant in Mobile, Alabama.

“We’ve been tracking it since it took off,” said Gottlieb as he glanced down at a computer screen monitoring the plane’s position. “It’s just over Floral City. It’s about 10 minutes out.”

At just after 1:30 p.m. the royal blue beauty was spotted soaring in on final approach. Jordan jumped out of his truck along runway 19R and got his camera ready to snap photos of the jet’s historic first touchdown at TPA.

“It’s like a kid in a candy shop seeing this today,” Jordan said with a wide smile covering his face. Moments later his camera began snapping photos rapid-fire as the new aircraft gently touched down for what appeared to be a perfect landing. “It’s what we like to see — a nice and smooth, quick landing.”

Over at Airside C, members of the Breeze Airways team gathered at gate C45 to watch as their brand new plane -- and the future of their young airline -- came taxiing into view.

“This is about a new as we get them,” said Jeroen Neijenhuis, a Start-Up Technician for Airbus on hand for the plane’s delivery. “No passengers have been on there yet.”

N203BZ and four other new deliveries will remain at TPA while Breeze trains crew members and works with the FAA to get the new aircraft type approved for commercial service.

But before that happens, flight attendants, maintenance technicians, and ticket agents all waited to be among the very first to ever board the aircraft.

It’s super exciting,” said Breeze flight attendant Kerry Liebold, on hand for the festivities. “It’s a fresh start and it’s just exciting to be here.”

The plane is so new, everyone boarding was asked to put on shoe coverings to keep the plane in mint condition.

Breeze COO Tom Anderson was also on hand to welcome team members aboard.

“It’s the culmination of a couple years of hard work by the entire team to take delivery of this first aircraft,” said Anderson. “It’s an absolutely instrumental part of our future. We have 80 of these aircraft on order. It’s the aircraft that allows us to expand the Breeze footprint to much longer-range markets across the entire country.”

Among those most impressed was Tampa International Airport’s very own Joe Lopano who came down with other members of the executive team for a first look at the new plane.

“It’s a beautiful airplane and its going to grow our airport in big way,” said Lopano standing underneath the plane just before walking up the steps to board.

The Breeze A220 utilizes to latest technology to give passengers a quiet more fuel-efficient ride. The plane’s cabin also has noticeable differences inside with oversized windows measuring 16 inches tall by 11 inches wide. There's also a surprisingly large nine-row business class section that spans nearly half the plane with 36 reclining chairs complete with foot rests.

The aircraft also comes with some of the latest tech including universal power outlets and charging ports for both USB-A and USB-C cords.

One of Breezes’s most frequent of fliers out of TPA also got an invite to check out the plane Friday. But it could be at least a few more months before he and other eager passengers get to experience the new A220s. Anderson said the planes likely won’t enter service until May as the airline works to wrap up proving runs and training by the end of April.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997460246086121}",neutral,0.9997460246086121,0

Ariel is the fourth medium-class mission in ESA’s Cosmic Vision programme.

Ariel will study the composition of exoplanets, how they formed and how they evolve, by surveying a diverse sample of about 1000 extrasolar planets in visible and infrared wavelengths. It is the first mission dedicated to measuring precisely the chemical composition and thermal structures of transiting exoplanets.

“Airbus has extensive experience of leading ground-breaking science missions, including JUICE, Gaia, Solar Orbiter, LISA Pathfinder and CHEOPS, on which we are building for ESA’s latest science mission, Ariel,” said Jean-Marc Nasr, Head of Space Systems at Airbus.

“In our Toulouse facilities, the largest space site in Europe, we have all the resources, facilities and expertise to design, manufacture and integrate the spacecraft and actively support ESA with payload development. Airbus Stevenage is fully integrated in the prime team for the engineering of the avionics, Radio Frequency communication and electrical design of the platform, as successfully proven for the development of Gaia”.

Airbus will lead the European industrial consortium with more than 60 contractors for building the satellite and provide expertise and support to ESA for the development of the payload module.

“With this milestone for the Ariel mission we celebrate the continuation of the outstanding relationship with our industry partners to keep Europe at the forefront of excellence in the field of exoplanet research well into the next decade and beyond,” said Günther Hasinger, ESA’s Director of Science.

More than 5,000 exoplanets have been identified since the first observation in 1995, but little is known about the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Existing space science missions are delivering results on exoplanets (such as the Airbus-built CHEOPS for ESA), but Ariel will be the first mission dedicated to studying the atmospheres of a large number of exoplanets, including main atmospheric component determination and cloud characterisation. Observations of these worlds will give insights into the early stages of planetary and atmospheric formation, and their subsequent evolution, in turn contributing to the understanding of our own Solar System. They could help us find out whether there is life elsewhere in our universe and if there is another planet like Earth.

The mission will focus on warm and hot planets, ranging from super-Earths to gas giants orbiting close to their parent stars, taking advantage of their well-mixed atmospheres to decipher their bulk composition.

After its launch, in 2029 on an Ariane 6 launcher, Ariel will be injected onto a direct transfer trajectory to the second Lagrangian point (L2). Thanks to its very stable thermal and mechanical design, the spacecraft will be able to carry out long term observations of the same planet/star system for a duration of between 10 hours and up to three days. Its mission will last four years with a possible extension of at least two years.

Airbus was prime contractor for ESA’s mission CHEOPS. Launched in December 2019, its goal is to characterise exoplanets orbiting nearby stars, observing known planets in the size range between Earth and Neptune and precisely measuring their radii to determine density and composition.

"The A380, Emirates and flying public : A winning combination - Airbus","Thu, 16 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLTEyLXRoZS1hMzgwLWVtaXJhdGVzLWFuZC1mbHlpbmctcHVibGljLWEtd2lubmluZy1jb21iaW5hdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Emirates received its 123rd A380 in Hamburg on December 16, 2021. The close collaboration with Airbus has shaped the identity of the A380 over the years and continues to transform the passenger experience today. It is the 251st A380 delivered by Airbus.

A shared ambition

The story of the A380 is closely linked to Emirates. In the early 2000s, Airbus launched the A380 in response to airport congestion by creating an aircraft capable of serving global hubs. An ambition shared by Emirates, whose unique geographical position allows them to connect Dubai to all the world's airports such as Johannesburg, London, Los Angeles, São Paulo, Singapore or Sydney, creating the possibility to fly more than 500 passengers around the world on one aircraft. Emirates' appetite for the A380 is insatiable: with 123 A380s delivered, 50 destinations and 12 maintenance centres, the airline is unquestionably a major A380 customer.

Emirates has built its growth and success with the A380. Each new A380 is an opportunity for Emirates to offer passengers a new experience in terms of cabin comfort and choice of destination, taking full advantage of the business model offered by the A380

-Bertrand George, Head of A380 programme.

The airline’s strategy has enabled Airbus teams to improve the aircraft's operational performance by up to 99.3%, a level never seen before on a four-engine aircraft - and to develop new innovations on an ongoing basis. The attention to detail given to the cabin illustrates the duo's win-win approach.

Cabin innovation

""Emirates has always pushed boundaries on design and cabin innovation, a key investment in its strategy,"" explains Michael Lau, A380 Industrial Designer in Hamburg. ""Many of the innovations developed on the Emirates cabin were a first for Airbus, such as the first class showers, lighting scenarios and the recent premium economy cabin. Emirates has challenged us and given us confidence in our cabin expertise. We are extremely proud of what we have achieved together on this aircraft.""

The premium economy cabin - positioned as middle-ground between economy and business class for comfort and amenitiesis available on Emirates' six newest A380s, and 52 of its 123 A380 will be retrofitted in the coming months to accommodate this new-generation premium class. This is another example of Airbus' ability to meet the most demanding cabin designs and Emirates' desire to offer passengers the most exclusive travel experience with the latest cabin standards.

A new passenger experience

""While Emirates takes passenger comfort to the next level on the A380, the aircraft itself offers features that have transformed the passenger's idea of air travel. ""The double deck fuselage, the cabin area and its technologies are unique. The A380 is particularly quiet, giving the feeling of calm to passengers onboard. This experience is shared by everyone, from passengers to pilots and crew. This has helped transform the attention that Airbus and the airlines now pay to passengers"" explains Michael Lau.

From the A380 to the A350, a transfer of innovation

The A380 is a pioneer in many respects. ""The A380 has enabled the four Airbus countries to work together and adopt common development and industrialisation methods. Overcoming our historical national heritage has been a huge challenge that made Airbus the integrated company we currently know"" says Bertrand George.

The experience gained on the A380 has been used by the entire Airbus family, and especially on the A350 programme. For the first time, Airbus teams used a Digital Mock-Up (DMU) as a 3D representation of an aircraft. Moreover, the A380 enabled the introduction of new advanced materials such as carbon fibre reinforced plastics and Glare (glass fibres and aluminum), offering better properties against corrosion and fatigue, as well as weight reduction. New technologies were also implemented such as the zero-splice acoustic panel, which significantly reduces noise on the engine air inlets. The new hydraulic system (with a 5000 psi pressure and the 2H/2E systems architecture where the traditional three hydraulic circuits were replaced by two hydraulic and two electric systems), reduced weight, and improved system redundancy and reliability.

The A380 of tomorrow relies on sustainable aviation fuels (SAF)

The A380 MSN1 test campaign is on-going to improve in-flight systems and SAF capability of up to 100%. A much-awaited challenge for Emirates, which has already embarked on this path by operating the first A380 ferry flight from Germany to the United Arab Emirates fuelled with 10% of sustainable fuel.

Flying for decades to come

Beyond this new collaboration with Emirates, Airbus is continuing to fully support all A380 operators and their fleets on over 70 destinations around the world. Since its entry into service in 2007, the iconic A380 has flown over 800,000 flights carrying more than 300 million passengers.

As the leading provider of military satellite communication services in Europe, Airbus will offer new communication services utilising the OneWeb constellation to select European and UK armed forces, and civil protection and security forces, from the end of 2021.

“As Europe’s leading government and defence secure communication provider, we continually look to extend and augment the services we offer. With the OneWeb LEO constellation we can offer military customers real flexibility as we look to deliver the future integrated mesh networks, combat cloud and information superiority that demand these new and innovative approaches. With this new offering based on the OneWeb constellation and Airbus technology, we will be the very first provider to offer this type of service to European forces,” said Evert Dudok, Executive Vice President of Connected Intelligence at Airbus Defence and Space.

Neil Masterson, OneWeb CEO added: ""We are thrilled to expand our work with Airbus to meet the connectivity needs of European defence and security agencies on land, at sea and in the air. Our network will enable secure, resilient, real-time communications for military and civilian government organisations, starting in the Arctic and expanding to global mobility use cases.”

In the frame of this partnership, Airbus and OneWeb plan to develop a complete range of secure services dedicated to the specific needs of armed forces for all their operations on land, at sea, and in the air.

LEO constellations enable the development of a new generation of terminals and antennas of reduced size, weight and power. These constellations will also make it possible to offer real-time space communications, very useful for transmitting live video streams from sensors such as those embarked on UAVs.

These new satellite communication services will provide armed forces with high-speed, all-IP (Internet Protocol) communications, making it possible to prioritise communication flows and ensure a very high level of availability. Users can complement existing services and networks with the ability to switch between LEO and GEO (Geostationary orbit) satellite communications throughout operations to derive the benefits of a flexible and interoperable network.

The partnership will offer services to connect vehicles on the ground, battleship at sea and aircrafts in flight. Thanks to these features, this connectivity service is fully designed to support future multi-domain cloud applications and enable information superiority.

The Airbus designed OneWeb satellites are currently being produced at the Airbus OneWeb Satellites facility in Florida, USA. After an initial start of service over the Arctic area from North Pole to the 50th parallel OneWeb expects its services to be available with global coverage of the Earth by the end of 2022 with a constellation of 648 satellites in low Earth orbit.

This complements Airbus’ existing footprint in Spain and reaffirms Airbus’ commitment to remain a strong player in the Spanish aerospace ecosystem. Airbus has long been a pioneer in composite technologies in Spain, both in materials and manufacturing processes.

“Establishing Airbus UpNext and the ZEDC in Spain strengthens our Research & Technology footprint in the country and ensures the involvement, from the start, of some of the best experts to support our zero-emission ambition,” said Sabine Klauke, Airbus Chief Technical Officer.

The Airbus UpNext entity will initially be accountable for the study and demonstration of hydrogen-powered non-propulsive energies as well as future tanking operations applying advancements in vision-based technology. This new presence will leverage the expertise of Airbus Commercial Aircraft, Airbus Helicopters and Airbus Defence and Space in Spain. Airbus UpNext gives future technologies a development fast-track by building demonstrators at speed and scale. This entails the sourcing of new talent and suppliers in order to evaluate, mature and validate potential innovative products and services that encompass radical technological breakthroughs.

The ZEDC follows the opening of two other ZEDCs in June this year at Airbus sites in Bremen, Germany and Nantes, France. The focus of the Spanish ZEDC is non-propulsive energy, systems for fuel cell cooling and fiber optics, as well as carbon fiber tanks for storing cryogenic liquid hydrogen. The tank development is done in a coordinated approach with the other Airbus national entities. These technologies are critical to fuel a future zero-emission aircraft, supporting the goal of an entry-into-service by 2035.

Airbus' NIRSpec instrument will study the universe's “dark ages” - Airbus,"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLTEyLWFpcmJ1cy1uaXJzcGVjLWluc3RydW1lbnQtd2lsbC1zdHVkeS10aGUtdW5pdmVyc2VzLWRhcmstYWdlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When launched later this year on NASA’s Webb Space Telescope, the Airbus Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec) – which is incorporated as a key instrument on the spacecraft – will provide deeper insights of the universe’s evolution.

NIRSpec was designed, developed, and integrated on the telescope by a team of more than 70 people at Airbus sites in Ottobrunn and Friedrichshafen, Germany, as well as Toulouse, France – with support from NASA and 17 European subcontractors.

It is one of four instruments on board the Webb Space Telescope (WST), which will succeed the Hubble Space Telescope as the next great space observatory. After launch, WST will embark on a month-long journey to its destination orbit around the second Lagrange point (L2), about 1.5 million kilometres away from Earth.

“I am very happy and excited to be still a part of the complete Webb team and to contribute to the greatest science story nowadays from the beginning to the end of commissioning. I am also very proud of the complete Airbus team working together as ONE team to make NIRSpec a success. Working with the complete Webb team all over the world (mainly with NASA) was and is the best experience I ever had.”

- Ralf Ehrenwinkler, Heaf of NIRSpec Programme

Deeper insights with NIRSpec

Known as the “super eye,” the NIRSpec instrument is a multi-object spectrograph capable of simultaneously measuring the near infrared spectrum of at least 100 objects – such as stars and galaxies – with various spectral resolutions down to 0.3 nanometres. The observations are performed over the wavelength range from 0.6 to 5.0 micrometres.

WST with the NIRSpec instrument will study the formation of the first stars and galaxies in our Universe, when it was only a few hundred million years old. NIRSpec will be able to capture the spectra of typically 60 to 200 galaxies at a time, allowing scientist to observe in exquisite details how they formed and evolved. Much closer to us, NIRSpec will also be able to study the atmosphere of exoplanets, these planets orbiting stars other than our Sun. It will, in particular, search for the signature of key molecules like water.

Due to NIRSpec’s excellent sensitivity, high resolution, and wide wavelength coverage, it is an ideal instrument to achieve a deeper insight of the evolution of the universe. It operates at -230 degrees Celsius and utilises a highly a-thermal concept (which prevents heat or changes in temperature), with the mirrors, mirror mounts, and optical bench base plate all manufactured out of Silicon Carbide Ceramic SiC 100®.

Commencing scientific operations

As the Webb Space Telescope will be observing the very faint infrared signals of very distant objects, this multi-billion-dollar space observatory needs to be shielded from any bright, hot sources – including the satellite itself. WST’s sunshield serves to separate the sensitive mirrors and instruments not only from the Sun and Earth/Moon, but from the spacecraft bus, as well.

Once the observatory has cooled down and stabilised at its frigid operating temperature in orbit, several months of alignments to its optics and calibrations of scientific instruments will occur. Scientific operations are expected to commence approximately six months after WST’s launch.

Airbus will support NIRSpec from liftoff to through the space telescope’s end-of-the commissioning phase. This includes monitoring its parameters 24/7 during the critical cool-down phase in space and initial functional testing when the NIRSpec instrument is turned on. The Airbus engineering team will continue to provide support from performance check-out and calibration through the WST’s commissioning.

Additional Facts

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) - carrying two Airbus instruments - will be launched from French Guiana on an Ariane 5 rocket. Here’s our top ten facts you need to know about the Hubble successor.

Named after NASA administrator James E. Webb

The telescope is named after James E. Webb (1906–1992), NASA's second administrator. James Webb is best known for leading the Apollo exploration programmes that landed the first humans on the Moon. He also initiated a vigorous space science programme that was responsible for more than 75 launches during his tenure, including America's first interplanetary explorer spacecraft.

The most powerful telescope ever

Jointly developed by NASA, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency, JWST is 100 times more powerful than Hubble, making it the largest, most powerful telescope ever launched into space.

The Elephant in space

At 8m high, with a total mass of 6,200kg, it weighs almost as much as an African elephant.

Peering back at the Big Bang

JWST will observe infrared light from space with unprecedented sensitivity, allowing it to peer back in time over 13.5 billion years to see the first galaxies formed after the Big Bang. It will push the frontiers of our knowledge, exploring how stars, planets and galaxies form, and studying our own Solar System as never before.

Two Airbus instruments on board

JWST carries a suite of four instruments: NIRSpec (Near Infrared Spectrograph) and MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument) - both developed by Airbus, plus the NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera), and FGS/NIRISS (Fine Guidance Sensors/Near-InfraRed Imager and Slitless Spectrograph), which are housed in the Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM).

Tennis court-size protection shield

A giant, five layered shield protects the telescope and its instruments from the light and heat of the Sun. At 22 × 14 metres, it’s about the size of a tennis court. The shield will keep the telescope and its instruments permanently in the shade where they will cool down to -230ºC.

Covered in a layer of gold

JWST’s primary mirror is 6.5 metres across (the Hubble one is 2.4 metres). Each of the telescope's mirrors are covered in a microscopically thin layer of gold, which optimises them for reflecting infrared light – the primary wavelength of light this telescope will observe.

Orbiting the sun

JWST will not orbit the Earth like Hubble does – it will actually orbit the Sun, 1.5 million kilometres away from the Earth. JWST will travel for about a month to reach its orbit.

One kilowatt powerhouse

One kilowatt is about what it takes to heat up some leftovers in a microwave — or to power JWST. Thanks to its solar array, it will stay energy-efficient more than 1 million miles (1.5 million kilometres) from Earth. The “powerhouse” of the telescope, the array, will supply energy to all of the telescope’s scientific instruments and communication and propulsion systems. While JWST will only use 1 kilowatt of power, the solar array is capable of generating nearly double that amount to factor in the gradual wear and tear of a harsh space environment.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5077541470527649}",neutral,0.5077541470527649,0
How to store liquid hydrogen for zero-emission flight - Airbus,"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTEyLWhvdy10by1zdG9yZS1saXF1aWQtaHlkcm9nZW4tZm9yLXplcm8tZW1pc3Npb24tZmxpZ2h00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hydrogen is critical to Airbus’ aim of developing the world’s first hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft by 2035. This will require an innovative approach to fuel storage. Airbus is now designing cutting-edge liquid hydrogen tanks to facilitate a new era of sustainable aviation

Hydrogen is one of the most promising technologies to reduce aviation’s climate impact. When generated from renewable energy sources, it emits zero CO2 during flight. Significantly, it delivers approximately three times the energy per unit mass of conventional jet fuel and more than 100 times that of lithium-ion batteries. This makes it well suited to powering aircraft.

However, storing hydrogen on-board an aircraft poses several challenges. Hydrogen may provide more energy by mass than kerosene fuel, but it delivers less energy by volume. At normal atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature, you would need approximately 3,000 litres of gaseous hydrogen to achieve the same amount of energy as one litre of kerosene fuel.

Clearly this is not feasible for aviation. One alternative would be to pressurise the hydrogen at 700 bars – an approach used in the automotive sector. In our example, this would slash the 3,000 litres to just six.

This may represent a huge improvement, but weight and volume are critical for aircraft. To go further still, we can dial down the temperature to -253°C. That’s when hydrogen transforms itself from a gas to a liquid, increasing its energy density even more. Returning to our example, four litres of liquid hydrogen would be the equivalent of one litre of standard jet fuel.

Demanding requirements for hydrogen storage tanks

Maintaining such a low temperature requires very specific storage tanks. They currently consist of an inner and outer tank with a vacuum in between, and a specific material, such as a MLI (Multi-Layer Insulation) to minimise the heat transfer by radiation.

Cryogenic liquid hydrogen storage tanks are already used in several industries, including aerospace, which gives us a good insight into the challenges involved. Airbus’ involvement in Ariane, for example, helped gain knowledge on systems installation, on cryogenic testing and fuel sloshing management, or even on how to build the inner tank itself.

But while there are some synergies between space flight and aviation, there are also numerous important differences. Safety requirements are different than for space launchers as hydrogen storage tanks for commercial aircraft would have to endure approximately 20,000 take-offs and landings, and would need to keep the hydrogen in the liquid state for much longer.

The new Airbus ZEDCs will host multidisciplinary engineering teams to create innovative solutions that will meet demanding aerospace requirements.

David Butters, Vehicles Systems Architect at Airbus

Crucial R&D for zero-emission flight

As part of its commitment to clean aerospace, Airbus is now adapting and evolving existing hydrogen storage technology for aviation. Several new research and development facilities across Europe have recently begun work on liquid hydrogen storage tanks for our ZEROe concept aircraft.

In the near term, liquid hydrogen tanks for commercial flight are likely to be metallic. This approach will be pursued by ZEROe Development Centres (ZEDCs) in Nantes, France, and Bremen, in northern Germany.

Longer term, however, tanks made from composite materials may be lighter and more cost-efficient to manufacture. Airbus will accelerate development of this approach at its new ZEDC in Spain, and its composite research centre in Stade, Germany.

“Adapting cryogenic tank technology for commercial aircraft represents some major design and manufacturing challenges,” says David Butters, Head of Engineering for LH2 Storage and Distribution at Airbus. ""The new Airbus ZEDCs will host multidisciplinary engineering teams to create innovative solutions that will meet demanding aerospace requirements.”

All ZEDCs are expected to be fully operational and ready for ground testing with the first fully functional cryogenic hydrogen tank during 2023, and with flight testing starting in 2025.

Qatar Airways goes after Airbus citing aircraft quality - The Associated Press,"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2J1c2luZXNzLW1pZGRsZS1lYXN0LXFhdGFyLTZmMWZiM2YzY2EzOTBhM2Q0MTZjYThmZjE3NmE4MDI00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qatar Airways is taking Airbus to court charging the manufacturer of failing to correct what it says is accelerated surface degradation impacting the Airbus A350 aircraft.

The airline said Monday that it’s seeking a rapid resolution in the High Court in London. The airline has now grounded 21 A350 aircraft citing the conditions of the plane.

Qatar Airways said in August that it was forced to ground of the aircraft over what it described as fuselages “degrading at an accelerated rate” in the long-range aircraft, further escalating a monthslong dispute with the European airplane maker.

While Airbus declined to specifically discuss the announcement, Qatar Airways’ decision to ground the aircraft raised questions about the A350s’ carbon composite fuselage, designed to make the twin-aisle aircraft lighter and cheaper to operate by burning less jet fuel. Qatar Airways also is one of the world’s top operators of the aircraft.

In its statement, Qatar Airways said it had been monitoring the degradation beneath the paint on the fuselage of the aircraft for some time. It described the issue as a “significant condition,” without elaborating.

“We strongly believe that Airbus must undertake a thorough investigation of this condition to conclusively establish its full root cause,” the carrier said Monday. “Without a proper understanding of the root cause of the condition, it is not possible for Qatar Airways to establish whether any proposed repair solution will rectify the underlying condition.”

Qatar Airways has a fleet of 53 Airbus A350s in both its 1000 and 900 series. The airline has another on order with the Toulouse, France-based airplane manufacturer, making its total order of 76 aircraft — the most of any airline worldwide. In June, Qatar Airways said it wouldn’t take any more A350s unless the problem was fixed.

Airbus declined to specifically discuss Qatar Airways’ grounding.

“As a leading aircraft manufacturer we are always in talks / working with our customers,” a statement said. “Those talks we keep confidential. We have no further comment on our customer’s operations.“

Currently, Singapore Airlines is the world’s top operator of the A350, with 56 now in its fleet. The airline said it “has not experienced the issues reported.” In America, Delta Air Lines has 15 in its fleet. The Atlanta carrier did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The A350 has a list price as much as $366.5 million, though buyers often get discounts in bulk deals.

Qatar Airways CEO, Akbar al-Baker, is known for his hard-changing, confrontational approach in negotiating with manufacturers and others.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9961174726486206}",neutral,0.9961174726486206,0
Cabin open to all - Airbus,"Fri, 03 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLTEyLWNhYmluLW9wZW4tdG8tYWxs0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 15% of the global population – around one billion people - is disabled. With this figure set to rise by 2050 as the traveling population ages, Airbus’ long held commitment to accessibility and inclusion for passengers of all abilities has never been more important.

A recent IATA survey showed that airlines are seeing a steady increase in passenger demand for wheelchair assistance, and up to 70% of disabilities are not always visible, such as difficulty in hearing and poor eyesight

The ageing passengers and persons with reduced mobility (PRMs) are probably the most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as a high risk group. With the current situation, the travel experience has been significantly impacted by increasing travel barriers and the challenges of a more digitised travel environment.

Innovating to stay ahead of the curve

Where physical distancing is needed, these practices may not be possible for disabled passengers who require additional assistance such as seat transfers, use of wheelchairs, or help with carry-on baggage. Some passengers may have a health condition which prevents them from wearing a mask. For airport operations it is challenging for airlines to mandate face mask-wearing without offending passengers who are legitimately qualified for an exemption.

“Airbus’ cabin and cargo team dealing with accessibility are working to stay ahead of the curve, developing solutions to facilitate cabin comfort with a better traveling experience for all cabin users”, explains Hans Giesa, Cabin and Cargo Senior Expert, Human Factors.

“Our job is to ensure that aircraft products and services meet everyone’s requirements, taking into account a wide scope of special needs along with operational efficiency,” he says. “The challenge is to balance all these different areas”.

Specialists who are experts in this field

There are multidisciplinary experts, including psychologists, ergonomics and aeromedical experts, engineers who specialise in usability, and experts with cabin crew experience. “In the early design phases, we use Virtual Reality tools - a mock-up will only be built if we can prove passenger usability” Hans says. “To analyse the ergonomics and operational aspects, we use digital mannequins representing our reference population. We can use small mannequins to test the reachability of a handle and the taller ones for clearances and postures where the space is limited,” adds Hans. “As soon as a mock-up is ready the team tests it with real users. There are a lot of accessibility regulations and part of our role is to ensure we comply. And we want to go even further, ” he adds.

Airbus’ cabin and cargo team dealing with accessibility are working to stay ahead of the curve, developing solutions to facilitate cabin comfort with a better traveling experience for all cabin users.

Hans Giesa, Cabin and Cargo Senior Expert, Human Factors.

For instance, Airbus is looking into innovation-based approaches to traveling with wheelchairs. The impact of damaged wheelchairs on passengers during the travel experience is clearly an issue. “I have seen it happen,” says design office engineer Dirk Thalheim, himself a wheelchair user and Airbus employee, who regularly advises the team on accessibility, acting as a tester for new solutions. “Your wheelchair is your legs so it is a horrible scenario to be stuck in an airport chair.” Mobility devices to be transported are growing in size, weight and complexity.

Airbus’ latest reduced mobility lavatory for the A320 Family cabin, offers optional transfer seats which enables a passenger to move from an onboard-wheelchair to an intermediate seat and then onto the lavatory. “People who don’t need assistance from a support person can use it and the wheelchair itself stays outside,” Hans explains.

Inclusive Travel

Going forward, the aviation industry is taking into consideration that the traveling public includes people who have a wide spectrum of disabilities and challenges that are not so obvious, such as hearing or visual impairments, hidden or intellectual disabilities, all of which need to be supported when they fly.

“With cabin design, we are mainly looking at the use of space but digitisation brings new opportunities to improve travel for everyone,” says Hans. “We can act as an integrator and push new ideas via organisations like Airbus Scale. Recent projects include a start-up looking at facilitating wheelchair use at airports and a navigation app for visually impaired travelers, which gives them information during the flight.”

Accessibility and inclusion remains a key priority for all our passengers who travel on an Airbus aircraft.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9878785014152527}",neutral,0.9878785014152527,0
Taking the Airbus Foundation's youth development outreach further - Airbus,"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLTEyLXRha2luZy10aGUtYWlyYnVzLWZvdW5kYXRpb25zLXlvdXRoLWRldmVsb3BtZW50LW91dHJlYWNoLWZ1cnRoZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When most of its youth development programmes were put on hold due to the first wave of COVID-19, the Airbus Foundation worked closely with non-profit partners to help them transition to using the organisation’s digital platform wherever possible.



As part of this effort, the Airbus Foundation adapted its youth programmes to support remote activities, created video sessions with partners, but also launched the Airbus Foundation Discovery Club newsletter to address educators and parents.

Marie Claire Certiat, Youth Programme Manager at the Airbus Foundation, experienced these challenges first-hand and took on the task to expand the Airbus Foundation's youth development outreach. We spoke with her to find out where the strategy stands now.

How have you gone about integrating a more digital approach to youth development efforts?

In 2020, a revised youth development strategy was approved to move towards a more digital approach, maximising the reach of our current and new STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and aerospace educational content.

We want to develop the audience for our digital platform (Airbus Foundation Discovery Space – AFDS) by expanding the Foundation content and partnerships while continuing to involve employees and be mindful of diversity, inclusion, and equity.

A review of STEM engagement trends has been completed in 2020. The primary result is the accelerated innovation in education due to the COVID-19 crisis, leading to:

Project-based learning, such as working on real-life challenges;

A need for self-learning formats (e.g., podcasts that are specifically adapted to students).

But it also clearly appears now that an all-digital approach in education has its limits for many young students and can even increase inequalities in some cases. That’s why we are deploying today a hybrid approach which can combine the use of digital content with in-person workshops.

What are your main targets to expand the reach?

Our main targets regarding the Airbus Foundation’s youth development pillar are to involve young people in need in our activities and with our content.

To do this, we are addressing teachers and educators, who are the main gatekeepers and facilitators for the young people, directly or via our NGO partners. Finally, we rely on our committed and engaged Airbus volunteers – who are the faces and ambassadors of the youth programmes around the world.

Some specific actions are being taken:

Leveraging and developing proximity to the Airbus sites;

Encouraging and enabling volunteerism;

Leveraging the hybrid approach to deploy programmes in the COVID-19 era;

Maximising the use of the Airbus Foundation Discovery Space content; and

Adapting the deployment of each programme to the local context.

Identifying local impact measurement in each programme around the world

Can you explain how you are combining three programmes into one?

Historically, the youth development programmes were defined as:

Airbus Foundation Flying Challenge (AFFC)

Since 2011, the AFFC programme has been inspiring young people who may be at risk of dropping out of school, to continue their education, to find their professional vocation and to realise their dreams through mentoring. Over 15 different versions have been launched over the years, according to the local context and needs. AFFC is almost all in-situ, close to Airbus sites and relying on Airbus volunteers.

Airbus Foundation Little Engineer (AFLE)

AFLE is a robotics-based workshop, supported by trained Airbus volunteers in some countries. It aims to encourage students between the ages of 10 and 16 to understand and embrace technology. It is a programme managed through our partner The Little Engineer, covering international markets (i.e., Kenya, Pakistan, Philippines) since 2016.

Airbus Foundation Discovery Space (AFDS)

Launched in 2018, AFDS is an online portal offering short animations that help young people (ages 8 to 12) understand science through the world of aerospace.

At the end of the day we will have all the youth activities under one roof and one branding: the Airbus Foundation Discovery Space. Our objective is to host content that is inspired from AFFC and AFLE. This will allow us to extend our age target and be able to offer digital content when physical interaction is not possible (as we have experienced during the COVID-19 lockdowns).

The objective today is to finalise the transition of our youth programmes across the world and to have a sustainable platform in 2023.

Marie Claire Certiat, Airbus Foundation Youth Programme Manager

How will it be on the sustainable platform?

The updated platform will eventually include three segments:

Discover (for ages 8-12): This segment will include existing AFDS animations and booklets (Mission to the Moon, Science of Flight). It also will feature Future of the Skies and its latest hydrogen-focused animations. Some learning scenarios, based on these animations, are available for teachers and educators to run sessions autonomously.

Experiment (for ages 12-14): Teenagers will be able to learn through experience videos supporting some scenarios created by our partners.

Inspire (for ages 14-18): Through a series of animations complemented by dedicated activity manuals (for both teachers and students), teenagers will learn more about various inspiring topics such as hydrogen, the environment, and mathematics, as well as female role models in aerospace. A self-development booklet also is under preparation, to be used individually or with an educator/mentor, addressing various topics in the frame of STEM and aerospace (i.e., self-care, tackling misinformation).

As the Foundation expands its strategy through our Airbus Foundation Discovery Space platform, we look forward to working with all our partners to reach even more young people from 8- to 18-years-old with engaging STEM content. So far, the youth development programmes have reached over 19,000 young people across the globe, and we are focusing on new populations in need.

How can I find out more about the Airbus Foundation’s Youth content?

Sign up for our Airbus Foundation Discovery Club newsletters to join a community of educators, parents and kids who are passionate about subjects on STEM and aerospace. You’ll get access to teaching materials such as videos, experiments, crafts, games, design challenges and quizzes which are fun and interactive!

In addition, you can always stay up to date on our activities via the Airbus Foundation website.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9969237446784973}",neutral,0.9969237446784973,0

The A400M provides cargo, passenger and tactical transport capabilities along with refuelling. Credit: Airbus.

The A400M (formerly known as the future large aircraft) is a military transporter designed to meet the requirements of the Belgium, French, German, Spanish, Turkish, Luxembourg and UK air forces.

The aircraft is manufactured by Airbus Defence and Space, a division of the European aerospace and defence firm Airbus.

Other companies with a share in the programme include BAE Systems (UK), EADS (Germany, France and Spain), Flabel (Belgium), and Tusas Aerospace Industries (Turkey).

A400M future large aircraft programme

A development and production contract was signed between Airbus and the European procurement agency OCCAR for 212 aircraft in May 2003. France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK, Turkey, Belgium, and Luxembourg initially signed it, but Italy subsequently withdrew. The order was consequently reduced to 180 aircraft, with deliveries starting in 2009.

The first metal cut for the airframe of the A400M took place in January 2005 and assembly began in 2007. The first flight was scheduled for early 2008; however, this was delayed due to engine development problems. The first A400M aircraft was officially rolled out in June 2008 and the long-awaited maiden flight took place on 11 December 2009.

The aircraft took off with 127t in weight, carrying 15t of test equipment, including 2t of water ballast. Its official maximum take-off weight is 141t.

In January 2009, EADS postponed the first deliveries of the A400M until 2012 and wanted to develop a new approach for the A400M to discover new ways to advance the programme.

2009 continued to be a troubled year for the A400M as estimates on the cost overrun of the project were released. The project was predicted to be up to €11.2bn over budget. The South African Air Force started to look at alternatives to the A400M and the European partners placed it under consideration. Airbus suggested that the programme may be scrapped unless €5.3bn could be provided.

Belgium, the UK, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, and Turkey agreed to lend Airbus €1.5bn to proceed with the programme in November 2010; however, Germany and the UK reduced the number of aircraft ordered to 53 and 22 respectively, decreasing the total to 170.

The first deliveries were made to the French Air Force in August 2013, and the remaining deliveries are expected to conclude in 2025.

A400M test flights

Following the maiden flight of the first A400M, known as MSN1, the second A400M, MSN2, completed its maiden flight on 8 April 2010, while MSN3 completed its maiden flight on 9 July 2010. The fourth A400M MSN4 completed its maiden flight in December 2010. The first production aircraft of the A400M (MSN7) completed its maiden flight on 6 March 2013.

The development of the A400M fleet was designated as Grizzly in July 2010. Trials with the MSN1, MSN3, and MSN5 are performed in Toulouse while those with the MSN2 and MSN4 are carried out in Seville, providing greater flexibility and taking advantage of the best weather conditions available.

The A400M was displayed at two events in 2010: the Berlin Air Show in Germany, and the Farnborough International Air Show in the UK.

The A400M was tested on wet runways and taxiways in October 2011. The water ingestion test was completed successfully. The latest cold-weather tests were concluded in February 2013.

Airbus completed a certification testing of the A400M on grass runways in November 2015. The aircraft demonstrated its ability to land on the soft unpaved runway at Pembrey Sands Beach, UK, in May 2017.

An A400M refuelled six of the Spanish Air Force’s F 18 fighter jets in a single flight as part of an air-to-air refuelling human factors certification flight conducted in December 2017.

The airlifter successfully demonstrated its paratrooping deployment capability, with a maximum dispatch of 116 paratroopers using both side doors in a certification fight test, which was conducted in May 2020.

The aircraft reached a new milestone with the qualification of its automatic low-level flight capability, which provides a special class capability for military transport aircraft, in May 2020. This first qualification phase involves operations with visual meteorological conditions with visibility for the crew. The second phase certification includes the instrumental meteorological parameters, without visibility.

In collaboration with the Spanish Air Force test centre (CLAEX), Airbus successfully completed the certification flight tests for the A400M cargo hold tanks (CHT) refuelling unit in February 2019.

The French Armament General Directorate (DGA) and Airbus Defence and Space conducted an important helicopter refuelling certification campaign for the A400M in April 2021. The flight tests for the airlifter involved refuelling operations with two H225M helicopters from the French Air Force.

The tests were conducted during the day and night at altitudes ranging between 1,000ft (304.8m) and 10,000ft (3,048m), and speeds as low as 105kt. The aircraft achieved the objective of refuelling two helicopters simultaneously for the first time.

A400M orders and deliveries

The number of firm orders for the A400M stands at 174 aircraft. Malaysia ordered four, and 170 aircraft were ordered by seven countries, including the UK (22), Belgium (7), Turkey (10), France (50), Germany (53), Luxembourg (1) and Spain (27).

In April 2005, South Africa signed a contract with Airbus Military to be a full participant in the A400M programme. South Africa ordered eight aircraft to be delivered between 2010 and 2014. South Africa then cancelled the order in November 2009.

In December 2005, Malaysia signed a contract for the purchase of four A400M aircraft. Deliveries began in March 2015 and concluded in March 2017.

The Spanish Air Force received a delivery of its first A400M in December 2016. The French Air Force received its 14th A400M aircraft in March 2018. Germany received the delivery of its 18th A400M in March 2018.

The Airbus A400M airlifter ordered by the Luxembourgish Air Forces made its maiden flight in April 2020, marking a significant milestone in its development. The aircraft, named the MSN104, was delivered in October 2020.

A total of 90 A400M aircraft have been delivered as of April 2020. Airbus delivered the tenth A400M to the Spanish Air Force in May 2021, which marked the completion of 100 deliveries globally.

In June 2019, German Bundesamt für Ausrüstung, Informationstechnik und Nutzung der Bundeswehr (BAAINBw) signed a contract with Airbus Defence and Space for the integration and certification of a J-MUSIC directed infrared countermeasure (DIRCM) system inside the defensive aids sub-system (DASS) for the A400M aircraft of the German Air Force.

Airbus delivered the first aircraft to the Belgian Air Force in December 2020. Known as the MSN106, the aircraft is based at the 15th Wing Air Transport in Melsbroek, Belgium.

The Republic of Kazakhstan signed a contract with Airbus Defence for the delivery of two A400Ms in September 2021. The contract also includes maintenance and training support. The first aircraft is expected to be delivered in 2024.

A400M design

The A400M has a much larger payload than the C-160 Transall and C-130, and the design makes extensive use of composite materials. Its capability for short, soft field landing and take-off is part of the requirement and the aircraft has six-wheel high-flotation main landing gear.

Airdrops and tactical flight requires good low-airspeed flight, and the aircraft is also capable of long-range, high-cruise speeds for rapid and flexible deployment.

UK-based GKN Aerospace supplied the complex carbon composite wing spars. South Africa’s Denel Aviation supplied the fuselage top shells and wing-fuselage fairings and EADS provided the 7m x 4m composite cargo door.

Assembly of the fuselage shells takes place at Airbus Deutschland in Bremen, Germany. The final assembly of the A400M aircraft takes place at EADS CASA in Seville.

A400M cockpit and avionics

The A400M cockpit is fully night-vision compatible and provides accommodation for two pilots and an additional crew member for special mission equipment operations. It is fitted with a fly-by-wire flight control system developed for the Airbus range of civil airliners.

Two sidestick controllers are installed to provide the pilot with an unrestricted view of the electronic flight displays. The throttle controls are placed centrally between the two pilot stations.

Thales and Diehl Avionik Systeme developed the A400M’s FMS400 flight management system, based on integrated modular avionics modules.

The avionics includes cockpit control and display systems with nine 6in² displays and a digital head-up display, which features liquid crystal display (LCD) technology and enhanced vision systems (EVS), for improved situational awareness, automated CG calculation, automated defensive aids systems, simple EMCOM switching, simplified switching, uncluttered screens, automated tanker and receiver fuel control, and auto fuel tank inerting.

The A400M for the German Air Force is fitted with a terrain-masking low-level flight (TMLLF) system, from EADS Military Aircraft, for low-level flight control. The TMLLF system has a Saab Avitronics flight computer. EADS Defence & Security Systems digital map generator is also fitted.

The aircraft also has a military mission management system (MMMS), which includes two mission computers, from EADS Defence Electronics. The MMMS controls cargo handling and delivery, load plan calculations, and the computed air release point before an airdrop, as well as fuel management and fuel operational ranges. The MMMS also manages the tactical ground collision avoidance system (T-CGAS) and military/civil communications.

Rockwell Collins was selected to supply the HF-9500 high-frequency communications system and the avionics full-duplex ethernet (ADFX). Cobham Antennas Division provides the SATCOM antennas. The A400M is integrated with very high frequency (VHF)/ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio equipment from Rohde & Schwarz’s SOVERON family.

Countermeasure technology

The EADS Defence Electronics defensive aids suite includes an ALR-400 radar warner from Indra and EADS, a multicolour infrared alerting sensor (MIRAS), a missile launch and approach warner developed by EADS and Thales, and chaff and flare decoy dispensers. Diehl Defence is the supplier of the DE DIRCM system, which is based on Elbit Systems’ J-MUSIC DIRCM and will be integrated into the German A400M fleet. The company awarded a $73m contract to Elbit Systems to provide the J-MUSIC DIRCM in June 2019.

The aircraft can also accommodate armour plating crew protection, bulletproof windscreens, engine exhaust treatment for infrared emission reduction, and inert gas explosion retardation and fire retardation in the fuel systems. The wings have hardpoints for the installation of electronic warfare pods and refuelling pods.

A400M transporter cargo systems

Rheinmetall Defence Electronics is supplying the loadmaster control system for electronic cargo control. The loadmaster consists of a workstation and control panel, eight sidewall lock panels, and a crew door panel. It provides efficient ground loading and airborne cargo drops.

The payload requirements include a range of military helicopters and vehicles, heavy engineering equipment, pallets, and cargo containers. The maximum payload carrying capacity of the aircraft is 37t and its volume is 340m³ (12,000ft³).

The cargo bay can transport up to nine standard military pallets (2.23m x 2.74m), including two on the ramp, as well as 58 troops seated along the sides, or up to 120 fully equipped troops seated in four rows. For Medevac, it can carry up to 66 stretchers and 25 medical personnel.

The A400M can carry 116 paratroops and airdrop them and their equipment either by parachute or gravity extraction. It can air-drop single loads up to 16t, multiple loads up to 25t total,120 paratroops and a wedge load of 6t, or up to 20 1t containers or pallets.

It can also perform simultaneous drops of paratroops and cargo (RAS/wedge or door loads) and very-low-level extraction (VLLE) of a single load up to 6.35t, or multiple loads up to 19t in total. Gravity extraction can be performed for a single load up to 4t, or multiple loads up to 20tt.

The cargo compartment can be configured for cargo, vehicle or troop transport or airdrops, a combination of these, and for aero-medical evacuation. A single loadmaster can reconfigure the cargo compartment for different roles, either in flight or on the ground. A powered crane installed in the ceiling area of the rear section of the fuselage has a 5t capacity for loading from the ground and cross-loading.

The rear-opening door has a full compartment cross-section to allow axial load movement, roll-on and roll-off loading, and the airdropping of large loads. The autonomous ground operations of the aircraft reduce the time on the ground to minimise the risk of hostile action from enemy forces.

A400M tactical tanker and refuelling

The A400M can be converted into a tactical tanker that has the ability to refuel a range of aircraft and helicopters within two hours. Flight Refuelling is supplying the 908E wing pod drogue system, which provides a fuel flow of up to 1,200kg/min for each pod, plus the centreline pallet-mounted hose drum unit fitted in the rear cargo bay, which supplies a fuel flow of 1,800kg/min.

Up to two cargo bay fuel tanks (CBT), which connect directly to the A400M’s fuel management system, can be fitted. The total fuel capacity is 46.7t or 58t with the CBTs.

GKN Aerospace won a £6m ($9.54m) contract from Cobham Mission Equipment in October 2011. It includes supplying the air refuelling pylon for the A400M and supplying a wing spar for the A400M.

Navigation in the A400M

The aircraft’s independent navigation system comprises an inertial reference system (IRS) integrated with a global positioning system (GPS). The weather and navigation radar is the Northrop Grumman AN/APN-241E, which combines wind shear measurement and ground mapping capabilities.

The radio navigation suite includes a pair of instrument landing systems, VHF omnidirectional radio ranging (VOR), radio distance measuring equipment (DME), air traffic control (ATC) transponders, automatic direction finders (ADF), and a tactical air navigation unit (TACAN).

Engines onboard the A400M

Airbus Military selected the three-shaft TP400-D6 turboprop engine manufactured by EuroProp International (EPI) in May 2003. EPI is a consortium formed by Rolls-Royce (UK, Germany), ITP (Spain), MTU (Germany) and Snecma (France). Rolls-Royce is responsible for the overall integration.

Each of the four engines has a maximum output of more than 11,000shp. EPI states that they are the largest turboprops ever made in the West. The engines are fitted with FADEC (full authority digital engine control), supplied by BAE Systems and Hispano-Suiza.

The turboprop arrangement has two turbofans on either side of the fuselage. The counter-rotation of the fans creates a symmetrical airflow over the wing to improve the lift capacity, handling, and stability. Additionally, it reduces the structural weight of the wing and minimises the adverse yaw in the event of an engine failure.

French firm Ratier-Figeac, a business unit of US-based Hamilton Standard, supplies the eight-bladed composite variable pitch FH386 propellers. The propellers are 5.33m (17.5ft) in diameter and can reverse and support the fully loaded aircraft up a slope. FiatAvio supplies the propeller gearbox. Electrical power generation systems are supplied by Aerolec, a joint venture between Thales and Goodrich. The variable frequency generators provide up to 400kVa.

Landing gear on the A400M

Messier-Dowty was chosen as the supplier of both the main and nose landing gear. Each main landing gear consists of three independent twin-wheel assemblies, providing six wheels on each side. This allows the plane to land on unprepared runways. The landing gear system also enables the A400M to ‘kneel’, which lowers the rear ramp to enable the loading of large vehicles.

The main landing gear shock absorbers maintain a minimum distance from the ground. The aircraft has two nose wheels and 12 braked wheels supplied by Messier-Bugatti.

The power plant is installed on the inner engine mount of the C-130K flight test-bed.

The A400M’s normal operating speed is 555km/h, but it can reach a maximum speed of 780km/h. The normal and ferry ranges of the aircraft are 3,298km and 8,710km respectively. The service ceiling is 11,300m.

The take-off and landing distances of the aircraft are 980m and 770m respectively. The aircraft weighs approximately 76,500kg and the maximum take-off weight is 141,000kg.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9982559084892273}",neutral,0.9982559084892273,0

Dubai & Mirabel — Global headlines over the next week will mark the end of the A380 with Airbus’s final delivery. Less visible will be its final delivery of an A320ceo family aircraft this week — an A321 for Delta Air Lines — marking the end of a 33-year production run of more than 8,100 aircraft for the European single-aisle.

The end of both the fraught superjumbo era for Airbus and the end of the line for the original A320 family are part of a shift taking place in the company’s overall strategy. Every civilian aircraft Airbus will deliver from here on out began its service life over the last six years, following a period of near-continuous development.

For the last decade, Airbus has consistently launched a new development effort roughly every two and a half to three and a half years. There was a notable hiatus between January 2015 (A321LR) and June 2019 (A321XLR), punctuated in the middle by the October 2017 acquisition of Bombardier’s CSeries program.

Now the A220, Airbus’s journey has been one of integration since the deal was finalized in July 2018; accelerating production, while retooling its supply chain and factory operations to reduce the cost of production. The jet’s customers are formalizing their ask of the plane maker, a stretched A220 — a model 500 — that would find itself in a spot once occupied by the sunsetting A320ceo, an airplane seating about 150 in two-classes.

In an interview with The Air Current at the recent Dubai Airshow, Airbus’s Chief Commercial Officer, Christian Scherer, called the launch of an A220-500 a “highly likely” decision and outlined the potential positioning for the aircraft.

Qatar Airways said Monday it had launched legal proceedings against Airbus in the High Court in London, following a dispute with the aircraft manufacturer over degradation of the exterior fuselage surfaces.

The issue has led the airline, one of the Gulf region's ""big three"" carriers, to ground some of its A350 planes and not accept further deliveries of the wide-body aircraft from the European firm until the problem is resolved.

""We have sadly failed in all our attempts to reach a constructive solution with Airbus in relation to the accelerated surface degradation condition adversely impacting the Airbus A350 aircraft,"" Qatar Airways said in a statement.

The airline added it ""has therefore been left with no alternative but to seek a rapid resolution of this dispute via the courts"".

Airbus declined to comment Monday.

The plane manufacturer said earlier this month it was ready to seek independent arbitration to settle the dispute.

It has argued the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has confirmed its findings that the paint-related issue had ""no airworthiness impact on the A350 fleet.""

The firm has also accused Qatar Airways of misrepresenting the problem as an airworthiness issue.

In its statement, the airline said it had initiated the legal proceedings in the technology and construction division of London's High Court ""to ensure that Airbus will now address our legitimate concerns without further delay"".

Qatar Airway noted it has currently grounded 21 A350 aircraft.

""We strongly believe that Airbus must undertake a thorough investigation of this condition to conclusively establish its full root cause,"" it added.

""Without a proper understanding of the root cause of the condition, it is not possible for Qatar Airways to establish whether any proposed repair solution will rectify the underlying condition.""

In a statement, Emirates President Tim Clark praised the A380 as a truly special aircraft. ""For Emirates, it gave us the opportunity to redefine the travel experience. ... The A380 will remain Emirates' flagship product for the coming years, and a vital pillar of our network plans.""

The largest commercial airplane ever built, the double-decker A380 was Airbus' bid to muscle past the Boeing 747, which had created the era of mass air travel. With two full passenger decks, it could it could carry about 555 people, depending on the configuration, with a range of 8,000 nautical miles, or 9,200 miles. Other facts about the plane, like its 310 miles of wiring and the complicated process for building the plane, were just as groundbreaking.

Emirates, long the largest A380 customer, made the airliner its flagship by installing features like premium class lounges and showers. Other carriers added their own posh comforts, like Etihad's first-class suite with separate living area and bedroom.

But for all advancements and the quiet and smooth ride it offered to all passengers (even in the back), the A380 had a remarkably short life as airliners go. Most are in production for decades -- Boeing built the 747 for more than half a century -- but the A380's assembly line was open only for 15 years with only 251 built.

For most airlines, the A380 was just too expensive, costing almost $500 million each. And while its mammoth size served Emirates' hub-and-spoke business model through Dubai, most other airlines opted for smaller planes like the Boeing 777 or Airbus A350 that could fly fewer people between more cities with a cheaper operating cost.

Though the pandemic struck another blow by parking many A380s around the world, airlines are beginning to return them to service as travel resumes. So even though the last A380 has been built, you'll still have a chance to fly in one for years to come.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9979586601257324}",neutral,0.9979586601257324,0
Bavaria orders eight five-bladed H145s for its police force - Airbus,"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0xMi1iYXZhcmlhLW9yZGVycy1laWdodC1maXZlLWJsYWRlZC1oMTQ1cy1mb3ItaXRzLXBvbGljZS1mb3JjZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Donauwörth, 15 Dezember 2021 – The Ministry of Interior of Bavaria has ordered eight five-bladed Airbus H145s for its police force, following a European tender launched earlier this year. The helicopters will replace the state’s current H135 fleet and will be operated by the two bases of the Bavarian helicopters squadron at the airport in Munich and in Roth, close to Nuremberg. The first delivery is planned for 2023.



“We’d like to thank the Bavarian government for its continued trust in our helicopters. This is good news for the employees at our Donauwörth site”, says Wolfgang Schoder, Managing Director of Airbus Helicopters in Germany. “The five-bladed H145s will further enhance the mission capabilities of the Bavarian Police. The flood in Germany and the pandemic have clearly demonstrated how important helicopters are for our society.”



There are more than 200 helicopters from the H145 helicopter family deployed for public services and law enforcement missions around the world.



The new version of Airbus’ best-selling H145 light twin-engine helicopter was unveiled at Heli-Expo 2019 in Atlanta. This latest upgrade adds a new, innovative five-bladed rotor to the multi-mission H145, increasing the useful load of the helicopter by 150 kg. The simplicity of the new bearingless main rotor design will also ease maintenance operations, further improving the benchmark serviceability and reliability of the H145, while improving ride comfort for both passengers and crew.



In total, there are more than 1,500 H145 family helicopters in service, logging a total of more than six million flight hours. Powered by two Safran Arriel 2E engines, the H145 is equipped with full authority digital engine control (FADEC) and the Helionix digital avionics suite. It includes a high performance 4-axis autopilot, increasing safety and reducing pilot workload. Its particularly low acoustic footprint makes the H145 the quietest helicopter in its class.

Microsoft Azure joins Airbus and others to build space ecosystem - GeekWire,"Thu, 09 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlZWt3aXJlLmNvbS8yMDIxL21pY3Jvc29mdC1henVyZS13aWRlbnMtaXRzLXNwYWNlLWVjb3N5c3RlbS10aHJvdWdoLWRlYWxzLXdpdGgtYWlyYnVzLWFuZC1kYXRhLXBhcnRuZXJzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An Airbus satellite image shows Seattle Center. (Pleiades Neo © Airbus DS 2021 / via Microsoft)

One year after Microsoft expanded its Azure cloud domain to the final frontier, the company is taking another giant leap in its campaign to build a digital ecosystem for the space community.

Today, Azure Space is lifting the curtain on a new array of space-centric offerings, including satellite imagery from Airbus, software-based communication links from ST Engineering iDirect and geospatial data analysis from Esri, Blackshark.ai and Orbital Insight.

Microsoft is also unveiling a couple of in-house tools to enhance satellite images.

Taken together, the enhancements should provide more possibilities for solving problems on our home planet, said Stephen Kitay, senior director of Azure Space.

“What we’re focused on is bringing the space community and cloud together,” Kitay told GeekWire. “Our purpose is to innovate faster, to help these companies innovate faster and democratize the benefits of space, because ultimately space is critical to life here on Earth.”

Satellite data has long been crucial for national security purposes — for example, to track Chinese military exercises or Russian troop movements. Emergency agencies can also use overhead imagery to coordinate the response to disasters ranging from floods and wildfires to refugee migrations.

Now commercial enterprises are now realizing that satellite imagery, combined with other geospatial data, can also point the way to better crop outlooks and smoother supply chains.

“Supply chains are extremely important to all of us, with what’s happening in the world right now,” Kitay said. “You’ll be able to monitor and analyze ports using spaceborne data, understand how many ships are at the port, how many containers are on the ships, do the math to understand how many trucks would then need to get the containers out of the ports.”

Azure Space’s new offerings are aimed at beefing up the space assets available to Microsoft’s cloud customers, delivering those assets more efficiently, and providing the analytical firepower that’s needed to extract insights from the torrent of space-based data that’s now available:

Azure Maps will start incorporating high-resolution imagery from Airbus satellites including SPOT, Pleiades and Pleiades Neo, along with elevation data from the WorldDEM dataset. The resolution for Pleiades Neo imagery is 30 centimeters (1 foot) per pixel — not quite good enough to read a license plate, but good enough to tell a car from a truck.

Azure Orbital is going into public preview, which means that anyone can communicate and control their satellite networks from ground stations operated by Microsoft and its partners. KSAT is the first of those partners to go online, but the network will continue to expand early next year with support from ViaSat and USEI.

Azure Orbital is partnering with ST Engineering iDirect to make software-based radio tools more available for space and satellite communications. iDirect specializes in satellite modems that work on the principle of virtualization — that is, moving functionality from proprietary hardware into software that can be deployed on general-purpose hardware to deliver a more cost-efficient solution for customers.

Three new partners will boost the Microsoft Azure’s capabilities for geospatial data analysis: Esri will work with Azure Orbital to streamline workflows for handling spaceborne data. Blackshark.ai’s advanced geospatial intelligence and 3-D synthetic environments will be incorporated into Azure. And Orbital Insight’s GO data analysis platform will become available on Azure as well.

Microsoft Research has found ways to enhance satellite imagery using artificial intelligence. SpaceEye can uses radar data from the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-1 mission as a baseline for transforming cloud-obscured satellite images into cloud-free images. Project Turing can use machine learning to heighten the resolution of satellite images. The technology is already being used to enhance Bing Maps worldwide.

Microsoft Research’s SpaceEye uses AI on Azure to remove cloud cover from satellite images. An actual image from Sentinel-2 is at left, and the predicted image with fusion of Sentinel-1 data is at right. (Microsoft Photos)

Microsoft’s Project Turing uses artificial intelligence to analyze raw imagery (left) and enhance details (right).

Judging by all this activity, it might sound as if Microsoft is encroaching on the market segments currently occupied by satellite operators and geospatial intelligence companies such as Maxar, Planet and BlackSky. But Kitay doesn’t see those companies as competitors.

“They are absolutely potential partners, because what we’re trying to do is enable an ecosystem, and bring together those in the industry on our platform,” he said. Kitay pointed to Azure Space’s collaboration on cloud connectivity with SpaceX’s Starlink satellite service and SES’s O3b service as another example of ecosystem-building.

“What you’ll see us continue to do is grow our partnerships, grow this ecosystem to ultimately serve the customers with multiple options in a resilient cloud-enabled platform,” he said.

There’s one company that Azure Space isn’t likely to enlist as a partner: Amazon.

Amazon Web Services has its own aspirations for cloud-enabled space services (or should that be space-enabled cloud services?), with an ecosystem that includes AWS Ground Station, AWS Space Accelerator and AWS for Aerospace and Satellite. Amazon is also well into the planning stages for its Project Kuiper broadband satellite constellation.

When Kitay was asked about the rivalry with AWS, he indirectly alluded to Project Kuiper as the sort of thing Azure Space won’t be doing.

“I would say that we are taking a strategically unique approach with the partner ecosystem that we are building out, where we’re not actually building and launching satellites,” he said. “We’re partnering with others who do, to enable this ecosystem built on the Azure cloud.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.5109168887138367}",positive,0.5109168887138367,1
Singapore Airlines selects the world's newest freighter - the A350F - Airbus,"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0xMi1zaW5nYXBvcmUtYWlybGluZXMtc2VsZWN0cy10aGUtd29ybGRzLW5ld2VzdC1mcmVpZ2h0ZXItdGhlLWEzNTBm0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 15 December 2021 – Singapore Airlines (SIA) has signed a Letter of Intent (LoI) with Airbus for seven A350F freighter aircraft. The agreement will see the A350F begin replacing the airline's existing B747-400F fleet in the fourth quarter of 2025.

“We are honoured by Singapore Airlines’ vote of confidence in the A350F as it renews its freighter fleet. The A350F is the world’s all-new large freighter and will be unmatched in its market segment in terms of operational efficiency, lower fuel consumption and CO₂ savings,” said Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer and Head of Airbus International. “It is gratifying that Singapore Airlines recognises the value of the A350F as we build on the strong partnership we already enjoy.”

Earlier this year Airbus received Board of Directors approval for a freighter derivative of the A350 designed to meet the imminent wave of large freighter replacements and the evolving environmental requirements, shaping the future of airfreight. The A350F will be powered by latest technology, fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce Trent-XWB97 engines.

As part of the world’s most modern long-range family, the A350F will have a high level of commonality with the A350 passenger versions. With a 109 tonne payload capability, the A350F will serve all cargo markets. The aircraft features a large main deck cargo door, with its fuselage length and capacity optimised around the industry’s standard pallets and containers.

Over 70% of the airframe will be made of advanced materials, resulting in a 30 tonne lighter take-off weight and generating at least 20% lower fuel consumption and emissions over its current closest competitor. The A350F will fully meet ICAO’s enhanced CO₂ emissions standards coming into effect in 2027.

Singapore Airlines is the world’s largest operator of the A350, with 56 aircraft currently in service across its network. The agreement with Singapore Airlines is the third commitment received for the new A350F over the past month.

The aircraft (MSN 272) departed Airbus’ Hamburg facility bound for Dubai as the 123rd A380 in the Emirates fleet. The airline, by far the A380s best customer, has taken nearly 50 percent of the A380s delivered to a customer.

A final goodbye

After lifting off, A6-EVS circled back for a low pass over the Finkenwerder runway. The pass was low enough that calibrated altitude (which is reported in 25 foot increments) reported 0 feet—even though the wheels never touched the runway.

Why fly the wrong way?

In a word: paperwork. To complete the financial paperwork attached to the delivery of the aircraft, it needs to be in UK airspace. So the flight headed into UK airspace for a very short period and then continued home.

Airbus’ heartfelt goodbye

During the customer acceptance flight earlier this week, the aircraft drew a giant heart in the sky over Germany.

""Copernicus Sentinel-6"" mission is already delivering high-precision measurement of the topography of ocean surfaces through the first of two satellites, “Sentinel-6A”, launched in November 2020. The mission’s two satellites are built to measure the distance to the sea surface to an accuracy of a few centimetres and map it in a 10-day rhythm over a mission duration of up to seven years. Their purpose is to record changes in the height of the sea surfaces, variations in sea levels and analyse and observe ocean currents. Accurate observation of sea surface height changes provides information about global sea levels, the speed and direction of ocean currents and the heat stored in the oceans. The measurements – obtained from 1336 km above the Earth – are crucial for ocean modelling and predicting sea level rise.

This information helps governments and institutions to establish effective protection for coastal regions. The data is also valuable for disaster management organisations, and for authorities carrying out urban planning, flood protection schemes, or dyke construction.

As a result of global warming, global sea levels are currently rising by an average of 3.3 millimetres per year - with potentially dramatic consequences for countries with densely populated coasts.

Part of Europe’s Copernicus, Sentinel-6 is also an international collaboration between ESA, NASA, NOAA and Eumetsat.

Airbus Delivers Last Superjumbo Airplane - VOA Learning English,"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbGVhcm5pbmdlbmdsaXNoLnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvYWlyYnVzLWRlbGl2ZXJzLWxhc3Qtc3VwZXJqdW1iby1haXJwbGFuZS82MzU3NjgwLmh0bWzSAV1odHRwczovL2xlYXJuaW5nZW5nbGlzaC52b2FuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvYWlyYnVzLWRlbGl2ZXJzLWxhc3Qtc3VwZXJqdW1iby1haXJwbGFuZS82MzU3NjgwLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus delivered its final A380 superjumbo airplane to Dubai's Emirates Airline on Thursday. The plane has been in production for 14 years.

The A380 is the world’s largest passenger airplane. It can seat up to 500 people on two levels. It includes things such as bars and showers in first class.

Production of the plane ended after just 272 were built. The company first had plans to produce 1,000 or more.

Airbus is an airplane-making conglomerate made up of separate companies in Britain, France, Germany and Spain. It decided to stop producing the A380 in 2019, as airlines became more likely to purchase smaller models.

Emirates Airline is by far Airbus’ largest buyer. The airline still believes in the superjumbo jet’s ability to appeal to passengers. Even though no more A380s will be built, Emirates will keep flying them for years. But many airlines disagree and stopped flying the A380 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Emirates Airline president Tim Clark disagrees with critics who say the days of large four-engine planes like the A380 are in the past.

""I don't share that view at all,” Clark recently told reporters. “And I still believe there is a place for the A380.” He added that the traveling public “absolutely (loves) that airplane.”

Talks to build the plane began in 2000. It was meant to be Airbus’ 21st-century answer to Boeing’s 1960s jumbo jet, the 747. The A380 has quiet Rolls Royce engines placed far out on its long wings. The body of the plane is light and easy to control.

The plane was a symbol around the world of European technology. But it was costly to make and did not become very popular with airlines. The A380 lost the company $522 million in 2018. Airbus decided to halt production a year later.

In January, Boeing announced that it would stop producing the 747 in 2022, after more than 51 years. The 747 is credited for changing the airline industry. But the company has been struggling to recover from production failures of its 737 Max plane, which led to deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019.

The first delivery of the A380 came in 2007, more than two years later than expected. When Emirates got its first A380 a year later, the financial crisis hit. Sales for the biggest planes fell.

Airlines seemed more interested in mid-size planes for shorter trips. Even on longer trips, airlines seemed to prefer smaller planes that were easier to fill with passengers.

Boeing began selling models of its smaller 787 Dreamliner, which was later followed by the Airbus A350.

""There was a slowing down of appetite and enthusiasm. We didn't share that view; we put this great (A380) aircraft to work,"" Clark said at an airlines meeting.

He added, ""We have what I think is one of the most beautiful aircraft ever flown.""

SPAINSAT NG programme successfully passes Critical Design Review - Airbus,"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0xMi1zcGFpbnNhdC1uZy1wcm9ncmFtbWUtc3VjY2Vzc2Z1bGx5LXBhc3Nlcy1jcml0aWNhbC1kZXNpZ24tcmV2aWV30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Madrid, 20 December 2021 – The SPAINSAT NG programme has successfully passed another important milestone, the critical design review (CDR) of the payload and the complete satellite, including the CDR elements of the Pacis 3 partnership project with the European Space Agency (ESA). The review was declared successful after verifying the good progress of the tests performed on the development models of the X-band payload.

This important milestone confirms the robustness of the design and technical capabilities of the SPAINSAT NG satellite system. At the same time, it signals the start of the manufacturing of all the flight elements of the satellites, noting however that long lead flight equipment is already being manufactured, in particular for the all-electric Eurostar NEO satellite platform.

Furthermore, the structure of the Communications Module of the first satellite, SPAINSAT NG I, is already at Thales Alenia Space's site in Tres Cantos, Madrid, to begin payload assembly, integration and testing activities.

""The technical teams of our co-contractors, Airbus Defence and Space and Thales Alenia Space in Spain and France, together with the rest of the subcontractors are doing an outstanding job, as are those of Hisdesat, acting as customer"", comments Miguel Ángel García Primo, CEO of Hisdesat. ""Likewise, ESA and CDTI are participating in an important way in the Pacis 3 programme, a Public Private Partnership between ESA and Hisdesat to develop the most innovative elements of the satellite, especially the X-band payload, with the most advanced active antennas in Europe, and the pallet, antennas and mechanisms in Ka-band.""

""This milestone confirms the viability of the satellite flight elements, with new technologies developed, here in Madrid by Airbus,"" said Fernando Varela, Head of Airbus Space in Spain. ""Our teams are ready to start the integration of the satellite payload, especially that of the new active antenna fully reconfigurable in orbit with geolocation capabilities.""

""The success of the CDR and the arrival of the Communications Module structure of the first satellite at Tres Cantos marks the beginning of a new momentous phase of the project,"" said Stéphane Terranova, CEO of Thales Alenia Space in Spain. ""For the first time we are going to carry out in Spain the integration of the communications payload of both satellites, which means making a qualitative leap for the national industry.""

Elodie Viau, Director of Telecommunications and Integrated Applications at ESA, said: “The Pacis-3 Partnership Project with Hisdesat has proven to be a catalyst for key technologies. Pacis-3 shows how the European space industry can respond to an emerging global market for secure satellite communications.”

ESA's Pacis 3 partnership project supports the development and integration of innovative satellite payload elements, such as reconfigurable transmit and receive X-band active antennas, and the deployable pallet with individually steerable Ka-band antennas. The partnership project takes the risk out of the partners' investments to respond to market needs.

The SPAINSAT NG programme comprises two satellites, SPAINSAT NG I and II, which will be located at different geostationary positions to operate in X, military Ka and UHF bands. The communication payloads of both satellites are provided by Spanish industry, including the integration of the Communications Module in Spain, a major step forward for Spanish industry. Airbus Defence and Space in Spain is responsible for the X-band payload, while Thales Alenia Space in Spain is responsible for the UHF and Ka-band payloads. Other companies from the Spanish space industry are also involved.

The SPAINSAT NG satellites include a fully flexible X-band payload, which employs active antennas with in-orbit reconfiguration capability, an integrated digital processor that will interconnect the X- and Ka-band payloads for cross-banding, and a dedicated high-speed service link that enables rapid reconfiguration. The satellites are based on Airbus' Eurostar Neo platform, a significant evolution of the successful and highly reliable Eurostar series with a full range of important innovations.

The latest technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Internet of Things, etc. are being applied in the development of new applications and services provided on the new satellites.

The first one of the SPAINSAT NG satellites will be launched at the end of 2023 and the second one a year later, guaranteeing the continuity of secure communications services.

The SPAINSAT NG satellites will have an operational lifetime of 15 years, remaining in service until 2039.

Reinforcing cabin hygiene | FAST Online | News - Airbus Aircraft,"Tue, 07 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vYWlyY3JhZnQuYWlyYnVzLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzcm9vbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEtMTItcmVpbmZvcmNpbmctY2FiaW4taHlnaWVuZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For over 50 years, Airbus has taken great care to design a safe environment for passengers and crew - a priority which remains unchanged for us in today’s world.

Since the onset of COVID-19, passenger concerns about cabin hygiene have increased drastically. Some key existing features of Airbus aircraft interiors that were previously less important for passengers - such as HEPA air filters and touchless surfaces - have now become well-known.

For airlines, getting back to service after being grounded by the pandemic means ensuring the aircraft is a clean and safe environment for passengers and crew. After in-depth studies on different technologies for cabin disinfection, Airbus assessed possible solutions and their advantages and constraints. One solution was to use antimicrobial polishes and a first product is already available for airlines, approved by Airbus for use in its aircraft. Further antimicrobial surfaces and textiles are also under examination and will be coming soon.

Following customer feedback, Airbus is working on different solutions but also on a comprehensive approach to on-board hygiene using “Clean Space” labelling in the cabin. This comprises three key elements:

Clean Air: Highest air quality for passengers & crew

Clean Interior: Disinfection methods

Clean Touch: Touchless functionality and antimicrobial surfaces

Here we focus on the antimicrobial surface solutions that teams are developing and improving.

6 questions from airlines about antimicrobial solutions

Airlines were clear about what they needed in terms of a cabin hygiene solution:

an easy-to-manage solution which would not severely impact turnaround times

a cost-friendly solution

a solution which would make passengers feel more protected in the cabin

a solution without health side-effects on passengers and crew

On top of these criteria, it was important to consider the amount of potential waste generated (products, cleaning cloths...) from an environmental view.

1. What are antimicrobial technologies?

Antimicrobial technologies further enhance hygiene in the cabin by introducing protection against bacteria, viruses and fungi to surfaces, both in linefit and retrofit.

Surface polishes and fabric treatments are typically for retrofit needs and have to be reapplied on a yearly basis to keep their efficacy.

Coatings and textiles have an antimicrobial additive embedded into the material or surface. T heir efficacy can last for the lifetime of the part they are protecting and are suitable for linefit as well as refurbishment.

These technologies will enhance the cabin hygiene, as they work 24/7 to self-sanitise the protected surfaces.

Statistical simulation

2. Where and how can they be applied?

Airline and passenger surveys conducted by Airbus (based on feedback from 85 customers worldwide) and IATA* have shown that the main hygiene concerns for passengers are the lavatories and frequently touched cabin surfaces. Hence we focused on solutions for both hard as well as soft surfaces. Polishes and fabric treatments can be applied through an easy “spray and wipe” process and require only a few hours of drying time. The whole procedure can be accomplished during a night shift, with the treatment lasting for up to a year before re-application is required.

The antimicrobial linefit solutions are introduced during the manufacturing process of the material - be it a coating, a synthetic material or a fabric - and do not require any specific maintenance by the operator.

When it comes to the cargo area, Airbus recommends focusing on the touch points of the ground staff such as controls and handles. Solutions for the cockpit are currently under investigation.

3. How did Airbus test the technologies?

We conducted a broad test programme to ensure cabin material compatibility in terms of chemical resistance, corrosion and of course airworthiness, mainly related to flammability, smoke and toxicity. We identified some additional advantages of the antimicrobial technologies: they do not show an impact on materials compared to UV light, or a risk of corrosion compared to fogging the cabin with disinfectant agents.

After a successful testing campaign the product (depending on the material type) can follow one of two paths:

It can be introduced in the Consumable Material List (CML) and the Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM), mainly applicable for retrofittable add-on solutions such as polishes.

CML reference: Self-Sanitizing - Aircraft interior Polish, Application code: 11LAD1

It can follow an entire material qualification scheme, mainly applicable for new linefit materials with embedded antimicrobial additives.

4. What about efficacy, durability and skin tolerance?

Of course, we also carefully reviewed the antimicrobial test report of the technologies provided by the manufacturer and conducted by independent, accredited test laboratories. It was key to see significant antiviral efficacy (not only antibacterial) before going further in the evaluations.

To evaluate the lifetime of the products we required a test report proving antimicrobial efficacy after artificial aging to simulate abrasion or ‘wear and tear’ in service, as well as the chemical and mechanical exposure due to regular cleaning cycles.

The reviewed products and their biocidal ingredients are in line with current EU and US regulations for these applications. We also considered potential restrictions on the ingredients, in order to be ready for the future.

None of the products are reported to cause skin irritation. For some products, even dermatological tests were performed in addition, as for cosmetics. Some products are also qualified in the medical and/or food industry or already used in public transport, showing good performance levels.

Airbus continues to follow the development and evolution of the technologies and will not accept any environmental, health or safety risks.

5. How will passengers know if or where these solutions are being used in the aircraft?

A specific challenge is to make these solutions perceivable for passengers, as they usually cannot see the technologies applied on the surfaces. However, perception is key! To address this issue, Airbus is testing its “Clean Space” labelling on surfaces which have been treated with antimicrobial materials. The labels are designed for a consistent approach across aircraft but also throughout the cabin, instead of a patchwork of symbols or pictograms different in each aircraft or module (e.g. in the lavatory and at the cabin seat). We believe this will help increase visibility for passengers on hygiene features, contributing to reassuring them during their flight.

6. Are the technologies meeting a short-term need or are they relevant for the future?

We need to think beyond the current pandemic. Hence, all solutions we have been looking at have a general working principle against microbes, whether viruses or bacteria. Of course, we need to provide a response to the current COVID-19 challenges but we also aim to make the cabin more resilient for potential future hygiene or health risks.

Antimicrobial polishes and surface solutions are recognised by Airbus as a viable cabin solution, enabling airlines to offer passengers a more hygienic and reassuring cabin environment. They tick the boxes in terms of application time, efficacy, tolerance and cost compared to other solutions already tested.

Technology in this field is evolving quickly, and Airbus continues to work with its partners to propose a wider choice of antimicrobial solutions and other hygiene features for their aircraft cabins.

Airbus validates the Galileo satellite navigation system's resistance to data attacks - Airbus,"Thu, 02 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTEyLWFpcmJ1cy12YWxpZGF0ZXMtdGhlLWdhbGlsZW8tc2F0ZWxsaXRlLW5hdmlnYXRpb24tc3lzdGVtcy1yZXNpc3RhbmNlLXRvLWRhdGHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Europe’s Galileo satellite-based navigation system will become the first to offer increased robustness in face of “spoofing” threats – providing enhanced security against malicious data forging attacks through an authentication mechanism developed and validated with Airbus expertise.

Called the Open Service Navigation Message Authentication (OSNMA), this new service allows Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers to verify the authenticity of all transmitted information – ensuring that data is coming from Galileo and has not been modified in a malicious attempt to misguide the user.

Airbus is supporting the EU Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA) in OSNMA’s service definition, including performance analyses and simulation. The company also has taken the lead for Galileo’s internal OSNMA testing phase – which commenced one year ago using a set of Airbus-identified service configurations. Since 15th November 2021 the OSNMA test signals are publicly available to any Galileo user. Thanks to Airbus developed software the global OSNMA service provision is monitored continuously and NMA data received by any GNSS receiver during the OSNMA test is processed to verify the authenticity of Galileo navigation messages.

Data security for billions of users

To be provided free of charge to any Galileo user worldwide, OSNMA enables a receiver to verify – using cryptography – whether incoming navigation messages truly originate from the GNSS system. It provides the user with keys and message authentication codes, which are processed by the receiver to verify the authenticity of transmitted navigation data.

Following successful completion of the internal testing, a public observation phase has been started – with the OSNMA signal made widely available, allowing receiver manufacturers and application developers to test and prepare their products. User feedback will be gathered as well.

This type of protection is increasingly important as billions of users rely on satellite navigation data across many market segments – including such critical infrastructures as telecommunications networks, power grids, police/fire services and financial trading systems, along with air, maritime and ground transportation.

By definition, satellite-based navigation systems utilise extremely weak signals to broadcast over wireless channels, making their data vulnerable to interference. Even low-power interference can jam or “spoof” (trick) users’ receivers within a radius of several kilometres, creating an attractive target for criminal attacks by terrorists, hackers and others.

Continuing Airbus’ space innovation

Airbus is a global space industry leader in satellite navigation, and provides a full range of capabilities to support the successful implementation of satellite navigation systems.

The company has been actively involved in Galileo system engineering activities for nearly two decades, supporting Europe in Galileo system design, signal definition, system performance analysis, system verification and more recently in the definition and validation of Galileo services and production of the Galileo Second Generation satellites.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9188260436058044}",neutral,0.9188260436058044,0

The contract includes the development of several prototypes and the delivery of a first batch of 30 aircraft (21 for the army, 8 for the navy and one for the air force). The French Ministry for the Armed Forces plans to order a total of 169 H160M helicopters, or Guépard as it will be known in the French armed forces. Deliveries will start in 2027 beginning with the French Army.

“The Guépard is the result of ten years of close cooperation with the DGA and the French armed forces,” said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters. “The H160M will bring new capabilities to the armed forces as it is adapted to modern warfare thanks to its increased connectivity, maneuverability, low acoustic footprint, and a fully integrated support system. Having the French armed forces, a world reference, as our launch customer for the H160M is extremely valuable.”

The first of a new generation of helicopters, the H160M is derived from the EASA-certified H160. It benefits from a low cost of operations and optimised flight safety. The H160 was designed to be a modular helicopter, enabling its military version, with a single platform, to perform missions ranging from commando infiltration to air intercept, fire support, and anti-ship warfare in order to meet the needs of the army, the navy and the air force. To ensure a high level of availability while reducing operating costs, the H160M’s support and services needs were taken into account from early in its design phase. Innovative and simplified, the H160M’s support is based on the exploitation of data through analytics.

Airbus Helicopters will guarantee a high level of availability through an innovative maintenance contract. Airbus Helicopters commits to an innovative management of maintenance and aircraft availability through a dedicated organization that has proven to be successful. This organization was introduced with the global support contract signed in 2020 for the French Cougar and Caracal fleet and has led to a significant increase in aircraft availability.

Trials conducted in the Moroccan desert in July 2021 demonstrated the efficiency of the H160’s inlet barrier filtration system in protecting the Safran Arrano engines against sand ingestion. The tests in the desert also demonstrated the efficiency of the automatic flight control system during the takeoff and landing operations with limited visibility due to sand clouds. The H160M will be ready to operate in the roughest conditions.

The military version of the H160 will be more discreet than previous helicopters with a reduced acoustic signature made possible by the Blue Edge blades. The H160’s stability, maneuverability, and an automatic flight control system will be key assets for the military version. The H160M will be equipped with Airbus Helicopters’ HForce weapon system, a modular and incremental solution enabling the use of a large choice of weapons. Equipment will also include a hoist and a fast roping arm.

The H160M Guépard will be equipped with the Safran Euroflir 410 electro-optical system, the Thales FlytX cockpit avionics suite, and AirMaster C radar. The pilots will be able to use the Thales TopOwl Helmet-mounted Sight & Display. The Guépard will also carry a self-protection suite, a satellite communication system and tactical data link system. The weapon package will include the MBDA ANL anti-ship missile, pod mounted and door mounted guns.

The airline manufacturer delivered the last of its double-decker superjumbo jets to Emirates on Tuesday, according to a press release from the company. The handoff, which took place in Hamburg, Germany, puts an end to a 15-year production run for the gigantic airplane.

The A380—which was announced in 1990 and made its debut nearly two decades later, in 2007—was Airbus’s attempt to knock the Boeing 747 off its perch. It didn’t accomplish this goal, but that doesn’t make the aircraft any less impressive. The plane has two full decks and typically seats 525 passengers, but can hold a maximum of 868 (the newest 747 version can hold just 467), making it the largest commercial plane ever built. It also has a maximum flying range, in its standard configuration, of 8,000 nautical miles (9,200 miles).

Airbus has built a total of 251 A380s over the last decade and a half, 123 of which were purchased by Emirates. Despite costing $500 million each, the Dubai-based carrier made the superjumbo jet the flagship of its fleet, according to CNET Roadshow. The airline made sure that flying aboard the A380 was a special experience, equipping each of the planes with opulent features like premium class lounges, showers and sleeper-style suites. The plane helped Emirates build a reputation as one of the world’s finest airlines.

“Emirates has built its growth and success with the A380,” Bertrand George, head of the A380 program for Airbus, said in a statement. “Each new A380 is an opportunity for Emirates to offer passengers a new experience in terms of cabin comfort and choice of destination, taking full advantage of the business model offered by the A380.”

The 15 years the A380 spent in production may sound like a lot, but it’s actually quite short compared to other major aircrafts. For comparison, Boeing has been building the 747 for over 50 years.

Airbus will build ESA's Ariel exoplanet satellite - European Space Agency,"Tue, 07 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzYS5pbnQvU2NpZW5jZV9FeHBsb3JhdGlvbi9TcGFjZV9TY2llbmNlL0FpcmJ1c193aWxsX2J1aWxkX0VTQV9zX0FyaWVsX2V4b3BsYW5ldF9zYXRlbGxpdGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Science & Exploration Airbus will build ESA’s Ariel exoplanet satellite 07/12/2021 6154 views 90 likes

ESA and Airbus have signed a contract to move forward with the design and construction of the Atmospheric Remote-sensing Infrared Exoplanet Large-survey, Ariel, planned for launch in 2029.

Ariel is the third in a trio of dedicated exoplanet missions conceived by ESA focusing on various aspects of this rapidly evolving subject area. It will follow Cheops, which launched in 2019, and Plato, scheduled for launch in 2026. Ariel will study the composition of exoplanets, how they formed and how they evolve, by surveying a diverse sample of about 1000 extrasolar planets, simultaneously in visible and infrared wavelengths. It is the first mission dedicated to measuring the chemical composition and thermal structures of exoplanets, linking them to the host star’s environment. This will fill a significant gap in our knowledge of how the planet’s chemistry is linked to the environment where it formed, or if and how the type of host star drives the physics and chemistry of the planet’s evolution. Observations of these worlds will give insights into the early stages of planetary and atmospheric formation, and their subsequent evolution, in turn contributing to the understanding of our own Solar System. They could help us find out whether there is life elsewhere in our Universe and if there is another planet like Earth.

Ariel artist impression “With this milestone for the Ariel mission we celebrate the continuation of the outstanding relationship with our industry partners to keep Europe at the forefront of excellence in the field of exoplanet research well into the next decade and beyond,” says Günther Hasinger, ESA’s Director of Science. The contract was celebrated between the two parties with a small ceremony at ESA headquarters in Paris on 6 December. “It is an exciting phase in a mission to move forward with a chosen design and assign a prime contractor,” adds Jean-Christophe Salvignol, ESA’s Ariel Project Manager.

Airbus will lead the European industrial consortium building the satellite and provide expertise and support to ESA for the development of the payload module. The Toulouse facility in France will be the main site for designing, manufacturing and integrating the spacecraft elements, while Airbus Stevenage in the UK will lead the engineering of the avionics, radio frequency communication and electrical design of the platform. “Airbus has extensive experience of leading ground-breaking science missions, including Juice, Gaia, Solar Orbiter, Lisa Pathfinder and Cheops, on which we are building for ESA’s latest science mission, Ariel,” said Jean-Marc Nasr, head of Space Systems at Airbus.

ESA’s new and future exoplanet missions The mission’s payload module, which includes a one metre-class cryogenic telescope and associated science instruments, is provided by the Ariel Mission Consortium. The consortium comprises more than 50 institutes from 17 European countries. NASA also contributes to the payload. The spacecraft is anticipated to launch on ESA’s new Ariane 6, together with the Comet Interceptor mission. It will operate from the second Lagrange point (L2), 1.5 million kilometres directly ‘behind’ Earth as viewed from the Sun, on an initial four year mission. Thanks to its very stable thermal and mechanical design, the spacecraft will be able to carry out long term observations of the same exoplanet system for a duration of between 10 hours and up to 3 days. “Launch may still seem a long way ahead for Ariel, but we are firmly on the road to a wonderful science mission, which will further broaden our understanding of solar system science well beyond the boundaries of our own planetary neighbourhood,” says Theresa Lueftinger, ESA Ariel Project Scientist. Ariel was selected in 2018 as the fourth medium-class science mission in ESA’s Cosmic Vision plan.

20 astonishing facts about the A380 superjumbo - CNN,"Sat, 18 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtc3VwZXJqdW1iby1hc3RvbmlzaGluZy1mYWN0cy9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFPaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtc3VwZXJqdW1iby1hc3RvbmlzaGluZy1mYWN0cw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

Beloved by passengers for its spaciousness and comfort, but disliked by airlines because of its running costs, the Airbus A380 has already entered its sunset years, even though it debuted commercially just 14 years ago.

Its final chapter was brought into sharper focus this week, when Airbus delivered the last ever A380 ever made to its new owners, Emirates, ending 18 years of the aircraft’s production.

The superjumbo was conceived at a time when larger planes carrying hundreds of passengers between hubs were an attractive proposition, but by the time it started flying, a different business model – smaller planes connecting smaller airports – had taken over in the aviation industry.

The biggest airliner ever produced, however, has amassed a following and even though a significant portion of the fleet won’t survive the pandemic, news of the airplane getting back into the air have electrified those who specifically look out for it when making flight reservations.

Now several airlines – including Emirates, British Airways and Singapore – are offering long-haul flights on the superjumbo again.

Whether you plan to catch a flight on an A380 while you still have the chance or not, here’s our pick of the 20 most interesting facts about this unique aircraft.

1. Bigger than ever

As the only full-length double decker passenger aircraft ever built, the A380 is so large that it could, in theory, carry a maximum of 853 passengers if all seats were economy class. However, no airline has ever fitted out an A380 like that: the highest recorded capacity is 615 people in a two-class (economy + business) configuration.

2. Wires for miles

Each A380 contains over 300 miles of electrical cables and wiring, and installing them proved so challenging that some of the initial delays with the production of the aircraft were blamed specifically on the wiring. In 2009, Airbus streamlined operations by speeding up the installation of the brackets that hold up the wiring – there are up to 80,000 in each aircraft.

3. Turbulent air

The size and weight of the superjumbo can cause problems to smaller planes closely following it – a phenomenon known as “wake turbulence.” In 2017, a small private jet flipped in the air when it crossed paths with an A380. Recent guidelines suggest that light aircraft should wait four minutes before taking off or landing on the same runway that was just used by an A380.

4. A serious paint job

It takes 950 gallons of paint to cover the entire 38,000-square-feet surface of an A380. A regular layer of paint adds 1,400 lbs of weight to the plane. The process usually takes about two weeks.

5. No need to pack light

The cargo hold of an A380 can carry up to 3,000 suitcases, and two loading belts – one at the front and one at the back – can be used simultaneously to speed up the process.

6. A true globalist

Each A380 is made of 4 million individual components, produced by 1,500 companies from 30 different countries. They all used to converge via road, air and sea to Toulouse, in the south of France, where the final aircraft was assembled.

7. A chance of showers

A fully stocked bar with onyx countertops on the upper deck is a relatively common sight on the A380. Less so are the fully functional showers fitted into the First Class suites on Emirates and Ethiad A380s, or the full-size double bed that Singapore introduced in its Double Suites.

8. More room than a basketball court

With its full-length double deck, the A380 offers almost 6,000 square feet of usable floor space, about 40% more than the second largest airliner, the Boeing 747-8.

9. Loved by Emirates

By far the largest operator of the A380 is Dubai-based Emirates, with 123 orders, followed by Singapore Airlines with 24. In total, 14 airlines have ordered and flown the A380. When Emirates canceled an order for 39 A380s in early 2019, Airbus decided to cease production of the aircraft altogether, by the end of 2021.

10. You can own a piece of one

While it has only just taken delivery of the last A380 ever made, Emirates has already retired the first one it acquired 14 years ago and handed it over to be recycled and turned into furniture items. Among items listed for pre-order at the Dubai Airshow in November were coffee tables made out of wheels, clocks made from wing fuel panels and the airplane’s entire 24-meter-tall tail. Also up for grabs was the plane’s fancy upper deck bar.

11. The secret compartment

With a cockpit crew of three and up to 21 flight attendants, the A380 has the largest crews of any airliner. The galley area has enough room for five people to work simultaneously, and crew members can rest in a “secret” area found in the third deck (the cargo one at the bottom), complete with bunk beds and a private restroom.

12. Not for everyone

The A380, due to its size, can’t be operated at all airports and many had to undertake modifications to be able to handle the superjumbo. In Munich, special hangar doors needed to be built to accommodate the aircraft’s tail. Airbus says that 140 airports worldwide are compatible with the plane, and over 400 can accept it in case of an emergency landing.

13. The longest flight

Emirates operates the A380’s longest scheduled passenger flight: Dubai to Auckland, 8,800 miles and over 17 hours in the air. In 2019, Qantas flew one of its A380s back to base in Sydney from Dresden, Germany, after refurbishment. The plane was empty and flew for over 18 hours and about 10,000 miles.

14. The shortest flight

Singapore Airlines has announced it will offer the new shortest A380 flight in the world: a quick hop of only 180 miles between Changi Airport in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. Previously, Emirates held this record with a flight from Dubai to Muscat, Oman, which clocked in at around 210 miles.

15. The cargo version that never was

When Airbus launched the A380 in December 2000, it offered a cargo version called A380F, designed to compete with the equivalent cargo-only models of the Boeing 747. UPS and FedEx both initially placed orders for the plane, but after its release was delayed they canceled them, leading to the cancellation of the A380F program itself.

16. Flappy wings

During takeoff, the A380’s wings flutter so much that they flex upwards by as much as 13 feet. That’s a lot, but not as much as aircraft with a higher amount of composite materials, such as the Boeing 787, whose wings can flap by as much as 25 feet.

17. Jumbo depreciation

The list price of an Airbus A380 was about $450 million, without factoring in discounts, which are common. The current fleet value, however, has plummeted: one estimate says that a 2005 model is now worth just $77 million, and a like-new A380 built in 2019 just $276 million.

18. Two per wing

The plane’s four engines are both one of its most distinctive factors and a drawback, as they require more fuel than twin-engined jets. They are made by either Rolls-Royce in the UK or Engine Alliance in the United States, and can lift the airplane’s maximum takeoff weight of 650 tonnes to cruising altitude in 15 minutes.

19. No US buyers

One of the main reasons why the A380 was never a commercial success is the fact that not a single US airline ever bought the plane. Major European carriers such as Air France, British Airways and Lufthansa did, but in small numbers. By the time the A380 was available, US carriers had already moved away from jumbo planes and towards more fuel-efficient, twin-engined aircraft such as the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350.

20. A partial comeback

The pandemic hit the aviation industry hard, and the A380 harder. Lufthansa and Air France never put their A380s back into service after they were grounded, deciding to retire their entire fleets instead, while Qatar sent half its fleet to permanent storage. On the flip side, Qantas, British Airways, Emirates, Qatar, Singapore, All Nippon and Korean Air have all announced that they are restarting A380 service.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9954707622528076}",neutral,0.9954707622528076,0

"Airbus, Boeing See Strong Narrowbody Demand Despite Disruptions - Aviation Week","Wed, 08 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvYWlyY3JhZnQtcHJvcHVsc2lvbi9haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLXNlZS1zdHJvbmctbmFycm93Ym9keS1kZW1hbmQtZGVzcGl0ZS1kaXNydXB0aW9uc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Almost two years after the onset of the novel coronavirus pandemic, which is the biggest shock experienced by aircraft manufacturing in recent history, Airbus and Boeing are still in crisis mode to varying degrees. Building production rates back up has proven more complicated than expected for a variety of reasons. Making decisions even on near-term product development appears to be on the back burner for the time being, except at Embraer. And the coming year is likely to be full of more operational challenges that will absorb the attention of management.

Airbus and Boeing plan to rebuild narrowbody production

Boeing 787 quality issue resolution will drag on well into 2022

Airbus A321XLR flight-testing and A350F development work to kick off

Boeing: Quantity and Quality

As 2020 drew to a close, Boeing eagerly anticipated seeing its two most important commercial programs, the 737 and 787, getting back on track in 2021. The 737 MAX family was grounded in the wake of two fatal accidents, and deliveries had stopped in March 2019. Quality problems had halted 787 deliveries in the fall of 2020.

A year later, Boeing is largely in the same spot. The 737 MAX is flying again, but the company’s goal of wiping out a stored backlog of about 460 aircraft by 2023 is out of reach. A production-line change forced Boeing to pause deliveries for a few weeks in the spring of 2021, and orderbook shuffling means already-built aircraft are changing hands, forcing the manufacturer to reconfigure them. The cascading issues resulted in handover of as few as six airplanes per month from Boeing’s stored inventory in late 2021—far below the target of 19-20 needed to clear the backlog by 2023.

New production is faring better. Boeing’s 737 program production rate was up to 19 per month in October and on track to hit 31 per month in early 2022, according to Boeing executives. The rate of 31 was picked to match demand with supply chain capabilities, Boeing CEO David Calhoun said in October. How much higher the rate will go, and when it might increase, will be dictated more by supplier capacity than market demand.

“As we go through the second half of the year and forward, I think that will be an assessment of the supply chain, not an assessment of demand, that gets us to whatever number we get to,” Calhoun said. “I think we’re going to be in a supply-constrained world, probably from [the] second half [of 2022] through all of 2023 with respect to narrowbodies.”

Boeing’s planned 737 MAX rate ramp-up will come alongside additions to the family. The 737-7 is on track for certification and first deliveries in 2022, while the 737-10 is slated to follow in 2023.

The -10 incorporates several changes ordered by regulators as part of modifications mandated following two fatal accidents, one in 2018 and one 2019, that together killed 346 people and grounded the fleet. The most significant is an enhanced angle-of-attack (AOA) system, championed by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), that adds redundancy to the original, two-AOA system (AW&ST Nov. 22-Dec. 5, p. 16). Faulty AOA data factored prominently in both accidents, prompting Boeing to redesign the MAX flight control software. EASA pushed to have the new system developed and phased in as part of Boeing’s return-to-service plan (AW&ST Feb. 22-March 7, p. 24).

With the 737 MAX program steadily gaining altitude, the 787 has assumed the spotlight as Boeing’s most troubled commercial program. Barring a major change as the year comes to a close, Boeing will end 2021 with just 14 787 deliveries—a figure that reflected an average month’s worth of customer handovers before the pandemic and production problems created intense headwinds.

While the airplane remains popular among customers—the 81% of 787s in regular service in October 2020 was the highest percentage among all widebodies and trailed only the A320neo and A220, Aviation Week Fleet Discovery data show—Boeing is struggling to address a spate of quality issues. They range from unfilled gaps between structural parts to potentially contaminated composite material. The issues likely will require attention on in-service aircraft, but that work may end up being phased into schedule maintenance checks.

The larger headaches come before delivery. In order to avoid ripping each one apart to check for every known defect, Boeing is working to develop effective techniques for identifying if an airframe has issues. As of late November, Boeing had not convinced the FAA that its methods were sufficient, and 787 production had slowed to less than two per month, down from an already reduced rate of five per month established in early 2021 (AW&ST July 26-Aug. 8, p. 22). The travails have left Boeing with more than 100 787s waiting for delivery and little certainty when the backlog will begin to decline.

“The exact timing of deliveries and future production rates will depend upon inspections and rework, ongoing customer and supplier conversations, production stability and our activities with the FAA,” Calhoun said.

In the coming year, Boeing will continue to transition its 777 program from current-generation models to the 777X, starting with the 777-9 (AW&ST Oct. 11-24, p. 22). The company is shifting production of the 777X from the low-rate initial production (LRIP) line at Everett, Washington, to the main line, which began producing the first few non-LRIP 777-9s or 777F freighters in the middle of 2021. Demand for large twin-engine freighters prompted Boeing to add extra positions on the line. The uptick means the combined output of the 777F/777X line has stabilized at around two per month—most of them freighters.

Meanwhile, the 767 line continues at three aircraft per month—all freighters or military tankers. As of Oct. 31, Boeing had 47 767-300Fs in its backlog—about twice the number of 777-8s believed to be on order. Boeing’s official orderbook does not break out variants within aircraft families.

The airframer remains confident that the extended 777-9 certification campaign likely will be completed just under two years from now—putting it on track for first deliveries in the last quarter of 2023. Production of additional 777-9s will therefore begin to increase in late 2022 as Boeing works to build up its delivery inventory and perform rework on the initial batch of 777-9 airframes already produced.

The future of the shorter 777-8, development of which was pushed back in 2019, now looks to be increasingly tied to that of the 777XF, the freighter version. Boeing is on the cusp of officially launching the cargo model and, according to industry sources, aims to reduce production cost and complexity by extending the size of the 777-8 and configuring the 777XF around the same fuselage length.

The 777-8 is currently defined with a shortened 229-ft. fuselage, compared with the 242-ft. 777-9, and a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of up to 788,000 lb. However, the 777XF probably will be offered with an MTOW target of around 805,000 lb., compared with 766,800 lb. for the current 777-200LR-based 777F model.

The 777XF is Boeing’s heir apparent to the 747-8F, production of which will end in late 2022—bringing down the curtain on a 53-year run and marking the end of the longest continuous jet transport assembly line. In close second place is the long-running 767 line, which continues at three aircraft per month—all freighters or military tankers.

Airbus: The Large and the Small

A key strategic decision Airbus made in 2021 was to get into the freighter business in earnest. At the November Dubai Airshow, the manufacturer received its first orders for the A350F from Air Lease Corp. (ALC) and CMA CGM Air Cargo. Aside from the A321XLR, the A350F is Airbus’ only near-term development program that will gain momentum in 2022 in preparation for entry into service in 2025.

The A350F, based on the A350-1000, will have a forward fuselage shortened by five frames and a large cargo door in the rear to make ground handling easier. The aircraft will have a 109-ton maximum payload and 4,700-nm range. It is being designed to accommodate 30 pallets or 30 AM-base containers on the main deck and 12 pallets or 40 LD-3 containers on the lower deck.

The decision to launch the freighter was obvious and long overdue, given that Boeing has enjoyed a monopoly in the space and with the cargo market far outperforming the passenger business in growth rates and margins. It is also a good way to keep Airbus engineers busy in the absence of many concrete near-term projects.

Work on the first A321XLR is even more advanced, with the first aircraft now in final assembly. The long-range version of the A321neo, able to fly missions of up to 4,700 nm, is expected to make its first flight next year and then enter a flight-test program ahead of its entry into service in 2023.

The A321neo is gaining more momentum as Airbus’ most important model. At the recent Dubai Airshow, Indigo Partners alone ordered 255 additional aircraft, and ALC bought an extra 75. The two orders underscored its importance: The A321neo has surpassed the A320neo as the most in-demand Airbus single-aisle, with more than 4,000 firm commitments. The A320neo has 3,800. The A321neo makes up 57% of the undelivered A320neo family backlog, a share that is likely to rise.

One big question going into 2022 is whether others will follow the lead of ALC and Indigo Partners and secure more production slots early. Their orders do not include any near-term deliveries—they are mostly for deliveries starting in 2025. Airbus certainly will try to persuade airlines and lessors that now is the time to buy further out, too, particularly since production in 2022 and 2023 is already sold out, and airlines that need additional lift in the short term essentially have to revert to lessor portfolios.

Another big unknown in the Airbus production planning is the future of orders from China. The backlog of undelivered aircraft from previous deals is fast diminishing, and Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury had hoped for a follow-up purchase that would ensure enough supply for Chinese airlines even in 2021. That has not happened, leaving Airbus looking toward a possible agreement in 2022. It is not clear whether China will be back in the market that soon, however. There is plenty of capacity available, and regional lockdowns are forcing airlines to ground aircraft frequently. The more or less complete halt of international flying also means that many widebody aircraft are available for use on domestic routes.

Airbus is factoring into its slot allocation the likely level of orders from China, but as pressure builds from clients in other regions that are ready to commit to purchases, these allocations are bound to be released in the not-too-distant future.

The A321neo boom has consequences for Airbus’ industrial setup, too. The Tianjin final assembly line will be enabled to build A321neos, and a dedicated A321neo facility is planned to be created in the former A380 hangar in Toulouse.

Airbus’ largest aircraft program came to a close in December, with Emirates scheduled to take delivery of the last A380 off the production line at the end of December or in January.

Ramping down is otherwise not one of Airbus’ problems. Many considered too ambitious the plans to raise production rates that Faury announced at the end of May 2021. Airbus stuck to them nonetheless, even though it experienced substantial issues with late cabin parts in September and October. In both months, the OEM fell short of its targets to raise output to around 44 from 40 aircraft per month by year-end. And it delivered just 30 and 32 A320neo-family aircraft in September and October, respectively. Faury says the OEM is “on top of it” and that the bottlenecks will be an issue of the past soon.

Airbus is still committed to raising single-aisle production to 65 aircraft per month by the middle of 2023, and much of that needs to be achieved during the course of 2022. Output of the A220, A330neo and A350 are also increasing: The A220 is slated to go to six from five aircraft per month in early 2022, the A330neo to three from two at the end of the year and the A350 to six from five in early 2023.

Embraer: New Props

Embraer is the only manufacturer of large commercial aircraft that is considering launching an all-new conventional aircraft in the near term. The company is talking to all three major engine manufacturers about a powerplant for a new large turboprop planned to enter service in 2027 or 2028, provided the OEM can stick to its schedule of firmly launching the aircraft before the end of 2022.

The turboprop would be offered in versions seating around 70 and 90 passengers. Embraer is pitching the smaller aircraft as a replacement for 50-seat jets in the U.S. market, putting forward the much better economics of a turboprop and the bigger cabin based on the E-Jet fuselage. In a three-class layout—including domestic first class, premium economy and regular coach—the cabin would have space for around 50 passengers.

The turboprop is planned to have rear-mounted engines and a propulsion system that can be adapted to future alternative sources such as sustainable aviation fuel or even hydrogen. Moving the engines aft also should reduce cabin noise and improve passenger appeal. The aircraft likely would be used typically on short sectors of around 250 nm, but it would be able to fly up to 800 nm.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9977144002914429}",negative,0.9977144002914429,-1
Airbus and Boeing express concerns over 5G interference in US - The Guardian,"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9zY2llbmNlLzIwMjEvZGVjLzIxL2FpcmJ1cy1hbmQtYm9laW5nLWV4cHJlc3MtY29uY2VybnMtb3Zlci01Zy1pbnRlcmZlcmVuY2UtaW4tdXPSAW1odHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vc2NpZW5jZS8yMDIxL2RlYy8yMS9haXJidXMtYW5kLWJvZWluZy1leHByZXNzLWNvbmNlcm5zLW92ZXItNWctaW50ZXJmZXJlbmNlLWluLXVz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The aerospace giants Airbus and Boeing on Tuesday warned that the US aviation industry had “concerns” about the potential interference of 5G networks with vital flight safety equipment.

The intervention increases pressure on US regulators in a dispute between airlines and mobile operators over the introduction of the high-speed mobile broadband technology in the US.

The Airbus Americas chief executive, Jeff Knittel, and the Boeing boss, David Calhoun, co-signed a letter to the US transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, “detailing the US aviation industry’s shared concerns over 5G implementation in the United States”, an Airbus spokesperson told AFP.

“Airbus and Boeing have been working with other aviation industry stakeholders in the US to understand potential 5G interference with radio altimeters,” which measure a plane’s height above the ground, the statement said.

Boeing said the aerospace industry was focused on “fully evaluating and addressing the potential for 5G interference with radio altimeters”.

“We are collaborating with aviation authorities, government leaders, airlines, and industry groups to ensure the continued operational safety of aircraft throughout the aviation system worldwide,” it added in a statement.

Leading telecom operators Verizon and AT&T were due to start using 3.7-3.8 GHz frequency bands on 5 December, after obtaining licences worth billions of dollars in February.

But they postponed the launch in November after the US aviation regulator expressed concerns over 5G signals’ possible interference with the altimeters.

The Federal Aviation Administration requested further information about the instruments, which can use the same frequency bands as 5G.

The FAA also produced directives limiting the use of radio altimeters in certain situations, sparking US airline fears over the potential costs.

In November, Verizon and AT&T wrote to the Federal Communications Commission confirming their intention to start deploying 5G in January 2022.

But they said they would take extra precautionary measures beyond what is required by US law until July 2022 while the FAA completed its investigation.

The conflict between 5G networks and aircraft equipment led French authorities to recommend switching off mobile phones with 5G on planes in February.

France’s civil aviation authority said interference from a signal on a nearby frequency to the radio altimeter with similar or greater power would cause “critical” errors during landing.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.77330082654953}",neutral,0.77330082654953,0

Qantas to switch domestic fleet to Airbus in blow to Boeing - Fox Business,"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL3FhbnRhcy10by1zd2l0Y2gtZG9tZXN0aWMtZmxlZXQtdG8tYWlyYnVzLWluLWJsb3ctdG8tYm9laW5n0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL21hcmtldHMvcWFudGFzLXRvLXN3aXRjaC1kb21lc3RpYy1mbGVldC10by1haXJidXMtaW4tYmxvdy10by1ib2VpbmcuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd said on Thursday it has chosen Airbus SE as the preferred supplier to replace its domestic fleet, switching from Boeing Co in a major win for the European planemaker.

Deliveries would start in mid-2023 and continue over the next 10 years to replace an ageing fleet of 75 Boeing 737s and 20 717s, Qantas said, adding that the new planes would also lower its carbon emissions.

""This is a clear sign of our confidence in the future and we've locked in pricing ahead of what is likely to be a big uptick in demand https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airlines-place-their-bets-looking-past-pandemic-renew-fleets-2021-12-15 for next-generation narrowbody aircraft,"" Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said.

It caps a successful week for Airbus after Singapore Airlines on Wednesday agreed to launch the A350 freighter plane and the planemaker looks likely to seize a narrowbody order from KLM as early as Thursday, in what would be the second defection to Airbus in 24 hours.

AMERICAN AIRLINES CUTS BACK ON INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS NEXT SUMMER DUE TO BOEING DREAMLINER DELAYS

The loss of the contract, first reported by Bloomberg News, is a blow to Boeing's 737 MAX. It interrupts a strong run of sales since the jet was cleared for flight late last year following a safety ban and means a further loss of narrowbody market share to Airbus.

Qantas has operated Boeing jets since 1959 and was once the world's only airline with an all 747 fleet. After the Airbus narrowbody win, the U.S. planemaker will now supply only its long-haul 787 Dreamliners.

Joyce said he was not concerned that his airline would be overly reliant on Airbus, weakening its ability to play the manufacturers against each other to get the best prices in the future.

""I'm sure that Boeing will be very, very aggressive to maintain their relationship with us, which is a big one with the 787s, when other competitions come up,"" he told reporters.

DEMS’ BILL TARGETS ‘RIDICULOUS’ AIRLINE FEES AS HOLIDAY TRAVEL RAMPS UP

Boeing said it was disappointed but looked forward to continuing its longstanding partnership with Qantas, while Airbus said it was honored by its selection.

Joyce said the flexibility to combine the Qantas narrowbody order with one already placed by low-cost arm Jetstar for more than 100 A320neo family planes was a key attraction of the Airbus deal.

Qantas plans to order Pratt & Whitney engines for the fresh batch of Airbus A320neo family planes, having chosen rival CFM International engines from GE and Safran for much of the Jetstar order. Pratt will also supply the engines for the A220.

""Pratt & Whitney gave us the best arrangements,"" Joyce said. ""We do feel that since both airlines will have a large amount of aircraft there are not mixed fleet issues.""

Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard said the Qantas deal was a sign that Airbus was more focused on building up its narrowbody backlog than raising prices even though it already has a higher market share than Boeing.

""From an Airbus perspective, this should also help convince sceptical suppliers of the business case for moving the A320 family (production) to 75 a month over time,"" he said.

French MoD Orders 169 HIL Guépard From Airbus Helicopters - Naval News,"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEyL2ZyZW5jaC1tb2Qtb3JkZXJzLTE2OS1oaWwtZ3VlcGFyZC1mcm9tLWFpcmJ1cy1oZWxpY29wdGVycy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French MoD Orders 169 HIL Guépard From Airbus Helicopters The French Armament General Directorate (DGA) yesterday awarded a 10 billion Euro contract to Airbus Helicopters for the development and procurement of the H160M in the frame of the Light Joint Helicopter program (HIL). Close to a third of the future ""Guépard"" fleet is intended for the French Navy (Marine Nationale).

The contract includes the development of several prototypes and the delivery of a first batch of 30 aircraft (21 for the army, 8 for the navy and one for the air force). The French Ministry for the Armed Forces plans to order a total of 169 H160M helicopters, or Guépard as it will be known in the French armed forces. Deliveries will start in 2027 beginning with the French Army. Among the whole fleet, 49 helicopters will be produced for the French Navy, with a first delivery expected in 2029.

Besides the helicopters, the contract includes the development of a training and support system and the fleet support starting delivery of the first helicopter. Production is to take place in four batches over a period of 10 years.

Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters said:

“The Guépard is the result of ten years of close cooperation with the DGA and the French armed forces. The H160M will bring new capabilities to the armed forces as it is adapted to modern warfare thanks to its increased connectivity, maneuverability, low acoustic footprint, and a fully integrated support system. Having the French armed forces, a world reference, as our launch customer for the H160M is extremely valuable.”

The H160 was designed to be a modular helicopter, enabling its military version, with a single platform, to perform missions for air-sea combat, protection and support of the naval force, special naval actions, State action at sea for the naval version. To ensure a high level of availability while reducing operating costs, the H160M’s support and services needs were taken into account from early in its design phase. Innovative and simplified, the H160M’s support is based on the exploitation of data through analytics.

Airbus Helicopters will guarantee a high level of availability through an innovative maintenance contract. Airbus Helicopters commits to an innovative management of maintenance and aircraft availability through a dedicated organization that has proven to be successful. This organization was introduced with the global support contract signed in 2020 for the French Cougar and Caracal fleet and has led to a significant increase in aircraft availability.

The French MoD ordered the H160M in three main versions, with at the bottom right the one for the French Navy (Airbus Helicopters picture)

Trials conducted in the Moroccan desert in July 2021 demonstrated the efficiency of the H160’s inlet barrier filtration system in protecting the Safran Arrano engines against sand ingestion. The tests in the desert also demonstrated the efficiency of the automatic flight control system during the takeoff and landing operations with limited visibility due to sand clouds. The H160M will be ready to operate in the roughest conditions.

The military version of the H160 will be more discreet than previous helicopters with a reduced acoustic signature made possible by the Blue Edge blades. The H160’s stability, maneuverability, and an automatic flight control system will be key assets for the military version. The H160M will be equipped with Airbus Helicopters’ HForce weapon system, a modular and incremental solution enabling the use of a large choice of weapons. Equipment will also include a hoist and a fast roping arm.

The Guépard offers an operational range of 700 km and an autonomy of 4 hours. Its maximum speed is 260 km / h. In addition to its crew (2 pilots), it can transport five equipped soldiers or a stretcher with a medical team. It will also be able to be refueled by a KC-130J aircraft in a later increment.

The H160M Guépard will be equipped with the Safran Euroflir 410 electro-optical system, the Thales FlytX cockpit avionics suite, and the AirMaster C AESA 2D tactical radar for the Navy and Air Force variant. The pilots will be able to use the Thales TopOwl Helmet-mounted Sight & Display. The Guépard will also carry a self-protection suite, a satellite communication system and tactical data link system. The weapon package will include the MBDA ANL anti-ship missile, pod mounted and door mounted guns.

Meanwhile, the French Navy will start operating an interim fleet of 6 commercial H160 helicopters in 2022 for a period of ten years. The selection of the Euroflir™410 optronic (electro-optical) system for the interim fleet was announced by Safran in September 2020.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9492118954658508}",neutral,0.9492118954658508,0

Airbus sees market for hundreds of H160Ms outside France - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 01 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLXNlZXMtbWFya2V0LWZvci1odW5kcmVkcy1vZi1oMTYwbXMtb3V0c2lkZS1mcmFuY2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has set an ambitious sales goal for the militarized H160M helicopter, projecting that hundreds of the medium twin could enter service in Europe and elsewhere over the next two decades.

France is expected to finalize a deal for up to 180 H160M helicopters for its army, navy and air force by the end of the year. Beyond that, Airbus expects to sell as many as 400 helicopters through 2030, according to Matthieu Louvot, executive vice president of Airbus Helicopters programs.

“We think, until 2030, the market beyond France could be 400 helicopters. So, very significant,” Louvot said Nov. 30 during a trade media briefing broadcast from Munich, Germany. “We think another 400 could be ordered by different nations around the world based on the fleets they have, the capabilities they could request.”

France has laid out plans to purchase at least 169 H165Ms, which it calls the “Guepard” — French for cheetah — and plans to sign a contract to formalize the Hélicoptère Interarmées Léger (HIL) or joint light helicopter, program with Airbus by the end of the year. The HIL aircraft, for which the H160M was selected in 2017, is scheduled to enter service and begin replacing five different light attack helicopters currently in use by 2026.

“We are progressing in the right direction and it should be hopefully soon, but it’s not my call entirely, otherwise it would be over already,” Louvot said when asked if the French contract was still on track to be signed before the new year. Louvot did not specify which countries outside France are targets for H160M sales.

Beyond France, the H160 has been floated as a potential replacement for the British Ministry of Defence’s New Medium Helicopter (NMH) requirement, which will replace the Royal Air Force fleet of 23 Airbus Puma HC2 support helicopters beginning in 2025. Airbus’s own H215M has direct lineage with the current Puma and the larger H225M Super Puma is another potential offering for the U.K. program. Airbus also sees the H175M, a militarized version of the H175, as an ideal candidate for the U.K.’s emerging requirement.

Leonardo Helicopters is also shopping its AW149 for Britain’s NMH program.

Though a military aircraft, the H160M owes its design and capabilities to the civil H160, which gained certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in 2020 but is still waiting for the validation of that approval from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The first delivery of a civil H160 is to a U.S. customer, making the FAA’s seal of approval all the more valuable, but travel restrictions resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic has prevented FAA personnel from visiting Airbus’s headquarters in Marignane, France.

Still, Louvot said the program is “well progressing” and that the H160M will benefit from the development, certification and looming entry to service of its civil counterpart.

“The H160M both leverages on all the advantages of the civil 160 machine and brings in all the new generation of sensors, of mission systems, of communication systems that you would expect from the state-of-the-art latest generation military helicopter,” Louvot said. “Most important for military missions, the autopilot alleviates the workload of the pilot and allows him to focus on the mission. And it’s a key advantage in many difficult environments where military customers fly. So, all these key advantages of the 160 platform will be carried on to the 160M and of course it will embed latest generation military sensors and mission systems.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999951124191284}",neutral,0.9999951124191284,0
Airbus-built MetOp-A weather satellite retires after 15 years of operations - Airbus,"Wed, 01 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTEyLWFpcmJ1cy1idWlsdC1tZXRvcC1hLXdlYXRoZXItc2F0ZWxsaXRlLXJldGlyZXMtYWZ0ZXItMTUteWVhcnMtb2Ytb3BlcmF0aW9uc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse/Friedrichshafen, 01 December 2021 – After 15 years of successful operations ESA´s/Eumetsat´s weather satellite MetOp-A ,which was built in the satellite centres of Airbus Defence and Space at Toulouse (France) and Friedrichshafen (Germany), has now retired. Launched on 19 October 2006, MetOp-A has tripled its planned lifetime and has become a game changer in contributing to weather forecasting and climate research.

MetOp-A was Europe’s first operational polar-orbiting satellite and the first in a series of three satellites which has brought tremendous benefits to numerical weather prediction (NWP). The satellite was packed with a set of novel and advanced instruments as well as with proven sensors. With the combined use of these eleven instruments, MetOp-A was the most influential weather satellite of its generation.

MetOp-B, launched in 2012, and MetOp-C, launched in 2018, will be used until the second generation of MetOp satellites – MetOpSG - is operational. This new generation of meteorological satellites will comprise two types of spacecraft, of which there will be three each. They are currently under development at Airbus. These new generation satellites will carry even more sophisticated technology to support weather forecasting and will increase our understanding of Earth system science.



The combined use of data from the original Metop satellites, of which two remain operational in orbit, represents on average nearly 45% of observations used at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and accounted for around 27% of the total impact of all observations assimilated by the Centre.

Data from Metop helps to analyse many aspects of the atmosphere in the forecasting model: the vertical distribution of temperature, humidity and indirectly the wind (IASI, AMSU-A, MHS and GRAS); surface winds (ASCAT); surface moisture over land (ASCAT); atmospheric winds (AVHRR); and ozone (GOME-2).

Derived products from IASI, GOME-2 and AVHRR are used to monitor and constrain many aspects of atmospheric composition.

The Airbus made ASCAT was a new generation scatterometer instrument designed primarily to measure surface wind over oceans. The data are also useful to derive soil moisture over land.

The instrument is equipped with two sets of three antennae allowing simultaneous measurements to be made from three directions to reduce the wind direction ambiguity.

For extended periods, ASCAT was the only scatterometer providing marine surface winds.

GRAS was the first fully operational European GNSS radio occultation mission, following on from successful research missions such as Airbus-built CHAMP.

The instrument is designed to measure temperature profiles and tropospheric humidity using refracted GPS signals. The consistent availability of GNSS-RO data helped fill large observation gaps in the stratosphere.

The Airbus built Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) instrument delivers atmospheric temperature and water vapour information for use in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) forecasts enabling short term weather forecasts to be made with greater accuracy. It is also sensitive to liquid water in clouds and so measures cloud liquid water content, and it provides qualitative estimates of the precipitation rate. The follow up instrument to MHS is the MWS (Microwave Sounder) also built by Airbus, and all MetOp-SG satellites will be equipped with them.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9751708507537842}",positive,0.9751708507537842,1

Star wars mugs flank her desk and several funny photo-shopped team pictures line the walls around her office. She is an engineer in the Airbus Helicopters design office and is responsible for finding alternatives to lead soldering and removing harmful substances from equipment and production processes to meet new European regulations.

She also has Werdnig-Hoffmann, a genetic condition that causes muscular atrophy and means she is in a wheelchair. “Travel can be challenging, and it’s not easy all the time,” she says with a laugh. “But my colleagues are there for me every day. From helping me take off my jacket in the morning, using the copy machine or to do some technical manipulations in the laboratory – I know I can count on them.”

Since the COVID-19 pandemic Nathalie Rubi has largely worked from home – staying in touch with her team with daily virtual meetings.

“Work hard and you’ll have a chance”

Nathalie was always drawn to computers and engineering. She was the eight year old who wanted to learn how a computer worked and who could be found every Saturday watching Airwolf, the 80’s television show about a renegade helicopter pilot. When she was ten, she went with her parents to an airshow and saw a Dauphin performing an impressive maneuver for the audience. “I knew right then and there that I wanted to work with helicopters and I told my parents. They both said to me, ‘Work hard at school and you’ll have a chance.’ And that’s what I did.” She went on to get a Diplôme d'Études Supérieures Spécialisées (DESS) in GEII (Génie Electrique et Informatique Industrielle) and graduated first in her class from Aix Marseille University at the St Jérôme Faculty of Sciences.

She applied for an apprenticeship at Airbus Helicopters (then Eurocopter) and the following year signed her first job contract with the company. “I love working with all of the different divisions at Airbus. I am working on solving problems for helicopters equipment, but many of my colleagues in the commercial aircraft or defence and space divisions are working on similar challenges, so we share information and if someone has a good idea, we all try to make use of it. It’s a really collaborative environment.”

When asked what advice she would give to girls and women interested in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), Nathalie says: “Work hard and demonstrate that there is no difference between women and men in the workplace. Some people want to think there is, and so you must demonstrate that there really isn’t. If you continue to work hard, they will see this.”

Adapting to the pandemic

With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic though, her work conditions have changed. “Due to my medical condition, my doctors told me to work from home. My job hasn’t changed – we have many virtual meetings and my colleagues call me every day to keep me up to speed on what is going on in the office. I miss being able to have a break and get a coffee with them, but we still talk all the time, they come by my home to see me – and they still send me jokes by email,” she says with a twinkle in her eye. “I’ve got a really good team.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997578263282776}",neutral,0.9997578263282776,0

With the model officially being retired following the delivery, Airbus officials decided to send the A380 out with extra love.

Flight Radar 24 reports that Airbus pilots routed the A380's final test flight in the shape of a heart over northeast Germany.

The test flight took off from an Airbus facility at Hamburg-Finkenwerder Airport and took a haphazard tour of the region. But before returning to the airport, test pilots drew a miles-wide heart in the German sky.

According to CNN, the Airbus A380 has been flying since 2007. The massive plane can carry up to 850 passengers on a single flight.

CNN reports that the plane is ""the largest mass-produced civil airliner in history.""

Airbus announced it would stop producing the A380 in 2019 and has since pivoted to making smaller and more fuel-efficient aircraft.

The final A380, registered as MSN 272, will be delivered to Emirates Airlines later this month.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998955726623535}",neutral,0.9998955726623535,0

Counterfeit Deicing Fluid? An Iced-Up Airbus A320 Flies A Horror Flight In Ice - Plane & Pilot,"Tue, 07 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBsYW5lYW5kcGlsb3RtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvdGhlLWxhdGVzdC9jb3VudGVyZmVpdC1kZWljaW5nLWZsdWlkLWFuLWljZWQtdXAtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjAtZmxpZXMtYS1ob3Jyb3ItZmxpZ2h0LWluLWljZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"From shortly after takeoff on Thursday evening, the pilots of an S7 Airlines Airbus A320 heading from Magadan (Sokol) to Novosibirsk in Russia were forced to fight for their survival and that of their crew and 200 passengers as the single-aisle Airbus started to go out of control. S7, formerly Siberia Airlines, has a fleet of 105 aircraft and flies to 150 destinations.

Preparations for Thursday’s flight had started normally, with the ground crew deicing the plane’s surfaces, paying special attention to the wings and tail surfaces. S7 pilots are, as you might guess, all too familiar with cold-weather operations, but they had no way of knowing what kind of challenge they would be up against that night.

Once they encountered control issues (a phrase no pilot wants to hear) shortly after departure, the pilots had to figure out what to do. Making it pretty was clearly not in the cards, as the plane and its occupants suffered through extreme departures from what we think of as controlled flight. Picture one of those terrible C-grade Hollywood movies that show an airliner out of control, with baggage bins coming open, carry-ons floating through the cabin and oxygen masks dropping. It was that kind of awful.

And it lasted for more than an hour. The crew initially tried to land back at Magadan twice, but were wildly unsuccessful, so they went flying, banging wildly as they made their way along at lower altitudes than jets ever fly during cruise, and eventually successfully landing at Irkutsk, near Lake Baikal, where warmer temperatures allowed the ice to subside, and the crew was able to make a normal landing.

No one was injured, but Russian authorities are already looking into why the plane went out of control, with much of the speculation centered on whether or not the deicing fluid was good, or if it was, if there were irregularities in the amount that was applied, or the time between its application and when the flight departed.

The Airbus A380s that never were | - AirInsight,"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vYWlyaW5zaWdodC5jb20vdGhlLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwcy10aGF0LW5ldmVyLXdlcmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Care to share?

With the delivery of the final Airbus A380 to Emirates on December 16, the book on the production of the world’s biggest passenger aircraft can be closed. The aircraft registered as A6-EVS is the 251st A380 that has been delivered new to an airline, yet it has manufacturing number MSN272. Indeed, between the last one and MSN001 (main picture), there are some twenty A380s that never made it to final assembly or weren’t built. Let’s have a look at the Airbus A380s that never were.

Checking the production list on A380.Boards.net, a group that consists of a bunch of A380 addicts, you can easily see where the gaps in the manufacturing of the aircraft have been.

Malaysia Airlines shows three frames that were not assembled. Parts of MSN018 reportedly ended up being used in MSN034, which is Singapore Airlines 9V-SKI. The same happened to MSN024 with parts used in MSN045 or Singapore SKJ. MSN032 was also destined for MAS but has never been built.

MSN037 was supposed to have been the first full freighter A380F for FedEx as part of an order for ten plus ten options announced in January 2001 and confirmed in July 2002. But by November 2006, the express delivery company had rethought its fleet plans and canceled its order, leaving 037 as unfinished business and a gap in the production sequence. It’s the same for MSN053 for FedEx, which fitted in nicely between Air France HPJE and China Southern B-6138.

Emirates took delivery of its 123rd A380 on December 16 in Hamburg. (Airbus)

While Emirates is the biggest A380 customer, having ordered 123 since placing the launch order on April 30, 2000, for five passenger versions, two -800Fs, and five options, there was supposed to have been another A380 based in the United Arab Emirates: that of the UAE government. Whatever happened isn’t known, but MSN060 wasn’t built.

Qantas initially ordered twelve A380s in November 2000 and placed a follow-on order for eight in December 2006, but got second thoughts in 2014 and finally canceled the eight options in February 2019. This also left a gap in the production sequence, as MSN091 (supposed to be VH-OQM) and MSN102 (OQN) weren’t built.

MSN095 is listed as destined for Qatar-registered Viajes Marsans, but not built. MSN097 wasn’t built without further information available. MSN104 was supposed to become F-HPJI for Air France, but the production was postponed and the frame was not built. HPJI actually was built later as MSN115. An identical situation happened to MSN118, destined to be Lufthansa D-AIMK. That one eventually was MSN146.

MSN129 was scheduled for Air Austral as the first of two A380s ordered in January 2009. They would have been the double-decker with the highest seat density of 840 seats. But Air Austral changed its mind too and finally confirmed the cancelation in early 2016.

Air Austral’s 840-seat A380 remained just a model aircraft as the airline canceled the two it had on order.

MSN162 was originally built for Japanese Sky Mark Airlines, as was MSN167. But this time, it was Airbus that canceled the order in 2014 as it questioned the financial solvability of the airline and the ability to take delivery of the four A380s it ordered in 2010. The two A380s have been in long storage until Emirates bought them and still flies them as EVB and EVA respectively. MSN185 was also destined for Sky Mark but never built.

The financial situation also determined the fate of the A380s for Russian airline Transaero, which initially ordered four A380s in 2011, then reduced it to three. When Transaero went bankrupt in 2015, the order remained in the book as Air Accord until it was finally canceled in February 2019. MSN196 and 212 were meant for Transaero but not built, although some parts might have ended up in another A380.

Two unbuilt frames, MSN245 and 246, were both originally destined for Emirates but postponed. There hasn’t been an MSN265 either, not built for no specific reason.

Two out of four Sky Mark A380s on order were already built when Airbus canceled the order with the Japanese airline. MSN162 now flies as Emirates A6-EVB. (Airbus)

This leaves nineteen unbuilt A380s. There were of course more canceled orders: Emirates canceled 39 firm orders plus sixteen options in February 2019, which meant the end of the production. Air France canceled two firm orders in 2017, lessor ILFC ten firm orders plus four options in 2011, Virgin Atlantic deleted its six A380s that were ordered in 2000 only in 2018, Lufthansa canceled three in 2013, UPS bought five A380Fs plus five options in 2005 but canceled in 2013. Kingfisher also ordered A380s in 2005 (five), but the airline was in deep trouble before production had started and canceled in 2013.

Vietnam Airlines ordered four in 2009 but deleted them four years later, Hong Kong Airlines wanted ten in 2011 but none in 2018. Lessor Amedeo was seen as a lifeline back in 2013 with an order for twenty, but was unable to place them and deleted the order in February 2019. And for some weeks in early 2016, Iran Air seemed to become a key customer with a potential order for twelve after the Obama Administration relaxed sanctions on the country. Reportedly, the airline and government weren’t on the same page as the fleet renewal was concerned and the deal never happened.

Virgin Atlantic’s A380 never made it on the production line but stayed in the order book for eighteen years. (Airbus)

The A380 book ends with 251 deliveries, of which 123 to Emirates, which already has parted out two with five more on the short-term list. Qantas got twelve and will keep only ten post-Covid, whenever that may be. Singapore took delivery of 24 A380s but phased out the five oldest when it got the five newest. Five SIA’s double-deckers have already been parted out, with to more awaiting the same faith, but has brought back five aircraft into service since November.

Air France has retired all ten A380s as the first airline to do so in 2020. Lufthansa has followed suit this year, with fourteen aircraft in deep storage that are unlikely ever to return with the German flag carrier. Korean Air took delivery of ten A380s in the past decade and today only operates one on just a weekly basis. China Southern has five of them, with two currently in maintenance. Malaysia Airlines’ six A380s, including the 100th to be delivered (9M-MNF) haven’t been in active service for a long time but four of them did very short flights since October. Thai’s fleet of six has been grounded since the start of the pandemic, while Hi Fly ended operations with its ex-Singapore A380 about a year ago.

British Airways has five out of twelve A380s back in service since November and plans to increase the number in the coming summer season. Qatar resumed A380s in December with four of its ten aircraft, but only because it had parked twenty A350s because of the paint quality issue. Etihad’s ten doubledeckers are all in storage, with the airline undecided if it wants to bring them back into service, saying it won’t one time and not ruling thing out the next.

The last new A380 customer became All Nippon Airways, but it has only had a short spell to enjoy the type on the dedicated route to Hawaii until the pandemic started to play havoc. It took delivery of its third aircraft on October 15 but since arriving in Tokyo the next day, the orange sea turtles have been sitting idle on the ground.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999884366989136}",neutral,0.9999884366989136,0

The Helicopter Company purchases 26 aircraft from Airbus Helicopters - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 06 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL3RoZS1oZWxpY29wdGVyLWNvbXBhbnktcHVyY2hhc2VzLTI2LWFpcmNyYWZ0LWZyb20tYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Helicopter Company (THC), established by the Public Investment Fund (PIF) as the first and only helicopter services provider licensed to operate commercial flights in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, has announced that it has signed a second purchase agreement with Airbus Helicopters.

Under the agreement, THC will purchase 20 of the newly launched five-bladed H145 and six ACH160 models. Eric Raz Photo

The agreement was signed by Raid Ismail, chairman of the board of THC and Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters, in the presence of His Excellency Khalid Al Falih, Minister of Investment and His Excellency Franck Riester, Minister Delegate for Foreign Trade and Economic Attractiveness.

The partnership will contribute to the ongoing expansion of THC’s regional fleet ahead of announcing an exciting new journey as a general aviation champion, with 20 orders of the newly launched five-bladed H145 and six ACH160 models. All aircraft feature cutting-edge technologies and biofuel-compatible engines, marking a significant milestone in developing alternatives to conventional aviation fuels and achieving decarbonization of helicopter flights.

Launching its services in 2019, THC was established by PIF as part of its strategy to activate new sectors in Saudi Arabia that support the realization of Vision 2030 and generate long-term commercial returns, while meeting the growing demand for luxury tourism and air travel services. THC previously signed an agreement to buy 10 Airbus H125 helicopters to increase access to domestic tourism destinations and provide services such as filming and aerial surveying – and is now further expanding its services with the addition of the H145 and H160 to its fleet.

“Our mission is to create a world-class national aviation champion and today, by signing this agreement with our trusted partner Airbus, we mark an important milestone in our journey to grow together with the nation in focus to fulfill Saudi Vision 2030. This deal comes as part of THC’s commitment to introduce new services with advanced technology that fulfill market demand and support the development of the Kingdom’s wider aviation sector,” said Raid Ismail, chairman of the board of THC.

“We are honored by the trust that THC is placing once again in our products and our teams and I am personally thrilled with this expansion of our partnership”, said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters. “THC will be taking full benefit of Airbus’ latest innovations with the five-bladed H145 and the ACH160, which we are certain will be valuable assets in their portfolio, enabling them to develop operations in the country,” he added.

Commenting on the partnership, Captain Arnaud Martinez, CEO of THC said, “We are extremely proud to sign this deal today with a world-leading aircraft manufacturer like Airbus. This important milestone is indicative of our growth as a business since our inception and of our positive contribution to the delivery of Saudi Arabia’s 2030 Vision in terms of stimulating new sectors. Moreover, it is a commitment to the recently announced goals of the Saudi Green Initiative to not only grow our business and industry, but to do so in a sustainable manner.”

The purchase agreement forms part of THC’s ongoing strategic regional alliances with industry leaders, including a recent partnership with The Red Sea Development Company (TRSDC), the developer behind the world’s most ambitious regenerative tourism project. The contract for the provision and operation of a twin-engine helicopter, crew and maintenance technicians, facilitates TRSDC emergency medical services (EMS) with alternate configuration change capability for passenger utility transport at TRSDC’s site on the west coast of Saudi Arabia.

John Pagano, CEO of TRSDC said, “As we strive to lead the way in creating a smart and sustainable mobility network for our destinations, we are thrilled to witness the growth and expansion of our partner, The Helicopter Company, who are paving the way to a sustainable future for aerospace in Saudi Arabia. It is imperative that the full aviation ecosystem continues to come together to build a resilient, stronger and greener future.”

"Air France-KLM, Qantas Order 300 Airbuses in Double Blow to Boeing - Skift","Thu, 16 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZXdlZWtseS5za2lmdC5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi9haXItZnJhbmNlLWtsbS1xYW50YXMtb3JkZXItMzAwLWFpcmJ1c2VzLWluLWRvdWJsZS1ibG93LXRvLWJvZWluZy_SAXBodHRwczovL2FpcmxpbmV3ZWVrbHkuc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvYWlyLWZyYW5jZS1rbG0tcWFudGFzLW9yZGVyLTMwMC1haXJidXNlcy1pbi1kb3VibGUtYmxvdy10by1ib2VpbmcvP2FtcD0x?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has picked up 302 new aircraft commitments from Air France-KLM and Qantas Airways in the past 24 hours. The deals flip the long-time Boeing narrowbody customers to Airbus narrowbodies in what is the latest blow to the struggling U.S. airframer.

Air France-KLM, on Thursday, unveiled orders for 100 A320neos and A321neos for its KLM and Transavia subsidiaries with deliveries from the second half of 2023. The deal includes purchase rights for another 60 narrowbodies. In addition, the group has signed a letter of intent for up to eight of Airbus’ recently launched A350 freighters for Air France.

And down under, Qantas on Thursday unveiled an agreement in principal for up to 134 A220 and A320neo family jets with an initial firm commitment for 40 aircraft — split equally between A220-300s and A321XLRs — to be finalized by the end of the airline’s 2022 fiscal year next June. Deliveries of the jets would begin in its 2024 fiscal year and continue for a decade.

The new Airbus narrowbodies will replace Boeing 737s at both Air France-KLM and Qantas. KLM and Transavia operated 136 737s at the end of September, and Qantas 75 737-800s. The latter will also use the Airbus jets to replace the 20 Boeing 717-200s in its fleet.

While neither airline commented directly on why it selected Airbus over Boeing, which was in the running for both deals with the 737 Max, some reasons are clear. For one, both Air France-KLM and Qantas already have sizable Airbus orderbooks, the former for the A220 and the latter for the A320neo family at its budget subsidiary, Jetstar. In addition, Boeing continues to face challenges getting jets out the door to customers. These problems include supply chain snags slowing the ramp up of 737 Max production, and quality issues that have temporarily halted 787 deliveries.

Qantas CEO Alan Joyce, however, said the Airbus deal had the “added advantage of providing ongoing flexibility within the order, meaning we can continue to choose between the entire A320neo and A220 families depending on our changing needs in the years ahead.” Qantas also considered Embraer’s E-Jet-E2 family in the narrowbody campaign that it launched in October.

Joyce’s comment hits at two widely criticized strategic decisions Boeing has made in the past two years: Cancelling its new mid-market airplane, or NMA, that would have competed with the A321XLR in January. And terminating its deal to acquire the majority of Embraer’s commercial airplane business — including the A220 competitor E2 program — in 2020. Without either offering, Boeing was hamstrung by the limits of the 737 Max family.

Tensions between Air France-KLM and Boeing over the 787 delays factored into the group’s decision, Reuters reported. In October, group Chief Financial Officer Steven Zaat said that roughly €500 million ($566 million) in 2021 capital expenditures had to be pushed to 2022 due to the delivery issues.

Air France-KLM had nine outstanding orders for 787-10s at the end of November, according to Boeing’s orders and deliveries data.

Boeing has also faced criticism from major customer Ryanair. Michael O’Leary, group CEO of the Irish discounter, said in November that the airline was not “overly impressed by the management locally in Seattle,” on top of disagreements over pricing for additional 737 Maxes.

“They need to get their shit together,” O’Leary said of Boeing, adding that their orderbook was going “nowhere.”

In one positive note for Boeing, Reuters reported that International Airlines Group is leaning towards firming up some or all of the memorandum of understanding for 200 737 Maxes it signed at the Paris Airshow in 2019.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9886800050735474}",neutral,0.9886800050735474,0
Qatar Airways takes Airbus to court over skin flaws - DW (English),"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3LmNvbS9lbi9xYXRhci1haXJ3YXlzLXRha2VzLWFpcmJ1cy10by1jb3VydC1vdmVyLXNraW4tZGFtYWdlL2EtNjAyMDQwNjHSAVVodHRwczovL2FtcC5kdy5jb20vZW4vcWF0YXItYWlyd2F5cy10YWtlcy1haXJidXMtdG8tY291cnQtb3Zlci1za2luLWRhbWFnZS9hLTYwMjA0MDYx?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qatar Airways is taking European manufacturer Airbus to court over its A350 passenger jets. The airline has grounded 21 of its A350s, saying a surface degradation issue could be a safety risk.

Qatar Airways said on Monday it had moved a court London against European planemaker Airbus for a dispute over skin flaws on its A350 passenger jets.

The Gulf airline has grounded 21 A350 jets, which represents 40% of its fleet of A350s. It says it's reacting to damage including blistered paint and corrosion to a sub-layer of lightning protection that could be a safety issue.

Airbus meanwhile intensified the dispute last week by accusing Qatar Airways of trying to misrepresent the problem as a safety issue.

Airbus said the A350 has a metallic material lying between its fuselage and its exterior layer of paint, which is designed to protect against lightning strikes. The planemaker says wear and tear can happen on the paint or the material, depending on plane usage.

Legal row unprecedented

Qatar Airways has 53 long-range wide-body of the twinjets, and has ordered another 23. But the company has not been accepting delivery of new jets since June, due to the corrosion problem.

""We have sadly failed in all our attempts to reach a constructive solution with Airbus in relation to the accelerated surface degradation condition adversely impacting the Airbus A350 aircraft,"" said Qatar Airways in a statement. ""Qatar Airways has therefore been left with no alternative but to seek a rapid resolution of this dispute via the courts.""

Airbus executive vice president for programs and services Philippe Mhun recently said the problems noted by the airline were not a safety issue, as argued by Qatar Airways. The aviation giant also recommended calling an independent assessor to review the dispute, which has been going on for more than a year.

A public legal fight between two aviation industry giants is unusual. Documents accessed by Reuters agency showed at least five other airlines in varying climates had complained about similar problems to Airbus since 2016.

By Tim Hepher and Tassilo Hummel

PARIS (Reuters) -Airbus completed a triple crown of aircraft orders at the expense of rival Boeing on Thursday with a deal to supply 100 narrowbody jets to Air France-KLM subsidiaries in the airline group's largest purchase based on number of jets.

The planemaker's third big win in 36 hours - after deals in Singapore and Australia - involves Dutch subsidiary KLM and a pair of low-cost units, all of which have traditionally relied solely on Boeing for widely used medium-haul passenger planes.

The contract covers Airbus A320neo and A321neo aircraft and will renew the medium-haul fleets of KLM and Dutch low-cost unit Transavia Netherlands, while also allowing for both the renewal and expansion of the fleet at sister unit Transavia France.

The bigger-than-expected order from Europe's second-largest airline group by fleet size came hours after Airbus clinched a deal to supply two tranches of aircraft to Australia's Qantas in a separate defeat for existing supplier Boeing.

Air France-KLM said it had also signed a letter of intent to buy four Airbus A350 freighters.

Collectively, those orders cap a dramatic week for Airbus after Singapore Airlines threw its weight behind its efforts to break Boeing's grip on the cargo plane market, with its own tentative order for seven A350 freighters.

Reuters reported earlier on Thursday that Airbus was poised to win all or part of the widely watched Air France-KLM deal after emerging as front-runner last week.

First deliveries are expected in the second half of 2023, with the bulk of deliveries expected beyond mid-decade.

Neither side gave a value for the deal, which experts said is worth billions of dollars.

Factors in Airbus's favour in recent months have included a gradual thawing of relations between French and Dutch arms of the airline group, which have different suppliers, and tensions over recent Boeing 787 delays, industry sources said.

Story continues

U.S. analysts said pressure from European governments to buy Airbus planes in return for bailouts may have played a role.

Even so, Boeing is ahead on firm orders so far this year as of the end of November, due to a sharp recovery in sales of the 737 MAX after it returned to service following a safety ban.

Boeing is expected to grab at least one more order before year-end and has the edge in a relaunched narrowbody contest at British Airways owner IAG, industry sources said.

Airlines are once again placing orders for jets as the industry starts to map growth beyond the pandemic and take advantage of lower fuel costs and emissions.

KLM and Transavia also jump ship from Boeing to Airbus | - AirInsight,"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vYWlyaW5zaWdodC5jb20va2xtLWFuZC10cmFuc2F2aWEtYWxzby1qdW1wLXNoaXAtZnJvbS1ib2VpbmctdG8tYWlyYnVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Care to share?

Christmas is a week early for Airbus. In another blow to Boeing after the Letter of Intent earlier today from Qantas for 134 A320neo-family and A220s, tonight it’s KLM that will jump ship. Air France-KLM announced an order for 100 A320neo’s and A321neo’s for itself, Transavia, and Transavia France. Air France-KLM will also buy four A350Fs. KLM and Transavia also jump ship from Boeing to Airbus.

A decision on the renewal of the medium-haul fleet KLM fleet was imminent, with the airline saying in October that the selection was nearing the final ten laps of the race. But Boet Kreiken, executive vice president of customer experience at KLM, also said that it was a very tough decision.

Earlier reports from Reuters in December indicated that KLM might opt for the Airbus while Transavia and Transavia France would select the Boeing MAX. But the Air France-KLM Board of Directors today opted wholeheartedly for the European aircraft models “to move forward on the Group’s goal to improve its economic and environmental performance through the introduction of next-generation aircraft. In doing so, the Group also demonstrated its ability to leverage purchasing synergies.”

KLM will take an unspecified number of A320neo’s and A321neo’s. (Airbus)

While the KLM press release says it is still a Memorandum of Understanding, the Air France-KLM statement speaks of 100 aircraft on firm order plus purchase rights for another sixty. The Group hasn’t specified the numbers by airline, even after questions from AirInsight, but KLM and Transavia will get both the A320neo and A321neo. “They will be divided proportionally between the three parties”, Air France-KLM says in an email. If A321neo means it also includes the A321LR and XLR, the airline says: “We ordered the A321neo family.” Which seems not to rule out sub-versions.

Engine choice in due course

There is no word either on the engine choice, which will be made “in due course.” If synergies will play a factor, then the Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan must be the favorite as it already powers the A220 fleet with Air France. Boet Kreiken said that the offerings from the engine manufactures would play an important role in the final selection.

When deliveries commence in the second half of 2023, the Airbus will begin replacing the existing Boeing 737-700s, -800s, and -900s. In the email to AirInsight, the airline says: “All 737s will be phased out gradually, which will take at least six years, starting in 2024.”

KLM has 46 Boeing 737s, Transavia 38, and Transavia France is about to grow its 737NG-fleet to 54. This makes 142 in total, so including the purchase rights, KLM and Transavia plan additional aircraft for future growth. Kreiken said in October that KLM would get some fifty aircraft.

KLM has a few pretty young NGs: it took delivery of four 737-800s in 2019, but they are all leased from Bocomm Leasing. However, the average age of the 737 fleet at KLM is 14.8 years, at Transavia 11.8 years, and at Transavia France 9.1 years. Part of the 737-700s at KLM is in the process of being replaced by the Embraer E195-E2.

Transavia and Transavia France have a combined 92 Boeing 737NGs that are likely to be replaced all by A320neo’s and A321neo’s. (Airbus)

The selection of the A320neo and A321neo for both Transavia and Transavia France comes somewhat as a surprise. In January 2019, the Dutch airline said it was close to finalizing an order for the Boeing MAX 10, which was supposed to be announced at the Paris Airshow. It was before the grounding of the MAX when AirInsight learned about this.

Kreiken confirmed in October that the 2019 plan played no longer a role in the imminent decision as the A320neo-family and the MAX 8 and 10 had become part of a new review process. The initial preference of Transavia France for Airbus was also gone. Eventually, KLM and Transavia will jump ship from Boeing to Airbus.

Air France will get four A350Fs

Air France-KLM also signed a Letter of Intent for four Airbus A350Fs plus purchase rights for another four. They will be placed with Air France, possibly by swapping outstanding orders for the A350-900. Air France recently received its eleventh -900 out of 38 on order.

In the media statement, Group CEO Ben Smith says: “These evolutionary orders will position our Group airlines on the path to improved performance while accelerating our decarbonization trajectory. This is a major step forward for KLM, Transavia, and Air France, which will operate the best aircraft available for their network needs. The outstanding performances of the A320neo family and of the A350F Full-Freighter, which are quieter, more fuel-efficient, and more cost-effective aircraft, make them the best choices for the long-term growth of our fleet. They will be instrumental in reaching our ambitious targets, including zero net CO2 emissions by 2050.”

KLM CEO Pieter Elbers says: “This order for fleet renewal is an important new step for KLM in achieving our objectives in terms of sustainability, customer experience, comfort, and efficiency. These new aircraft will allow us to substantially reduce CO 2 emissions and noise levels. I’m glad that, by continually investing in our product, we can improve our efficiency and customer experience. The coronavirus pandemic has forced us to focus on survival for the past eighteen months. Now that we are on the road to recovery, we can look to the future once more. With this order, which is an important component of our restructuring plan, we will further prepare our company as well as our customer experience for the future.”

Airbus most happy

Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer said: “We are honored with Air France-KLM Group’s foresight, after an in-depth evaluation, to acquire the latest generation Airbus A320neo Family aircraft and A350F to modernize its European medium, short-haul, and cargo fleets. This milestone decision shows again that an aircraft’s value lies primarily in performance, reliability, fuel efficiency and reduced CO2 emissions, all criteria in which the Airbus product line excels.”

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury tweeted: “Thank you Air France-KLM for this show of confidence. We’re humbled by the magnitude and deep significance of your choice.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999499320983887}",neutral,0.9999499320983887,0
Air Canada A220 business seat excites with comfort options - Runway Girl Network,"Mon, 27 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvYWlyLWNhbmFkYS1hMjIwLWJ1c2luZXNzLWNsYXNzLXNlYXQtZXhjaXRlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With over 24 hours of transit under my belt, the last flight of a multi-leg trip home to Seattle from Dubai was finally here. I had been looking forward to this experience: Air Canada business class on the Airbus A220 plying Toronto Pearson-Seattle.

Thanks to its PaxEx-friendly reputation, the A220 is one of my favorite jets. Air Canada began flying the type just before the pandemic. And I had been pining for it ever since.

The adventure began at Air Canada’s US departures check-in desk at Toronto Pearson, on the top level of Terminal 1. A friendly agent printed a fresh ticket for me, and directed me toward security.

Pearson is a pre-clearance airport, and travelers headed back to the United States clear US immigration at the departure airport instead of on arrival. I followed the signs for Global Entry, which took me on a circuitous path that led to the exact same security lines everyone else was in. The line was short, but almost every single bag was being flagged for a secondary search. That included mine, which added an extra 15 minutes. Once cleared, it was an easy breeze through US customs and immigration.

I was looking forward to catching a quick bite and some water in Air Canada’s well-regarded transborder lounge. Unfortunately that didn’t happen. An elevator bank simply wouldn’t go to the correct floor. Eventually I gave up. There were no signs marking the lounge’s closure, though I later discovered online that it had been temporarily closed for renovations.

Luckily, Toronto’s transborder area is large, airy, and well-appointed with shops and dining, the opposite of many others that frankly feel like traps. I bought a bottle of water and a snack before finding a quiet place to rest before the flight.

Boarding began on time, and I quickly settled into seat 3F in the business class cabin. I found space for my two bags in the oversized overhead bin.

There were no pillows or blankets on offer, which was a shame as the cabin was very chilly for the first hour. There was, however, a COVID-19 sanitary kit with mask and hand sanitizer. A pair of headphones were offered by the crew, who took dinner and drink orders in business class before departure.

The A220 business cabin is simple but stylish, relying on gray-scale neutrals that help the airline’s classic red maple leaf logo to stick out in a good way. It’s also small, with only three rows in a standard 2-2 layout.

The hard product shines in both look and feel. Living space is ample, with 21 inches of width, and 37 inches of pitch. The A220’s oversized windows do some serious heavy lifting here too. Their large size — over a foot long and almost as wide — let in lots of natural light and make the space feel much larger.

The Collins Aerospace-built MiQ seat boasts both a legrest and a footrest, a decision I absolutely love.

The legrest and the seat’s four inches of recline are controlled via two buttons tucked into the armrest. The other armrest holds a large, bi-fold tray table.

There’s a small amount of personal storage in the center armrest, enough for chargers and personal items. The same cubby also holds an international power port, USB port, and headphone jack. The only downside is that the space is not well lit, making it hard to find anything there on a dark evening flight.

The seat’s entertainment screen is large — 13 inches — and incredibly crisp and sharp. It also comes with USB and USB-C charging ports.

Unfortunately the Panasonic Avionics eX1-powered system quit on me during taxi, taking three full resets and over an hour to resolve before starting back up. Once it did, it was initially slow and glitchy before settling into its typical snappy self. I appreciated the crew’s diligence in attempting to solve the issue, but it was deeply frustrating nonetheless.

That said, much like my other experiences with the carrier’s IFE, the system did not disappoint. It was well stocked with plenty of content, enough to still hold my interest after more than 22 hours of flight time.

I didn’t give a nod to it in earlier reviews, but the airline offers entertainment in 15 languages plus closed captioning and accessibility options for folks who need them. That’s a serious commitment to inclusivity that should be lauded, and one I wish I saw more widely in the industry.

While I was waiting for the IFE to return, I fired up the Intelsat 2Ku onboard Internet and bought a full-flight browsing pass for $10.

There were two faster options available, both of the streaming variety; they could be purchased in one-hour increments or for the full flight. Prices topped out around $35 for the fastest, full-flight plan.

My $10 browse pass was more than ample, recording usable speeds of 5 Mbps down and 3 Mbps up.

The meal service began maybe twenty minutes after departure.

Drinks came first, and I ordered an apple juice that was presented to me in a juice box with a glass on the side. It didn’t exactly feel very premium.

The entrée came shortly after that, a beef tenderloin dish that was sadly both simultaneously dry and swimming in a bland demi-glace sauce. The sauce overpowered whatever flavor profile the vegetables brought to the table. I didn’t finish the meal.

It turns out the IFE wasn’t the only thing that needed a system reset. After dinner, what I thought would be a short nap cascaded into a full four hours of sleep. By this time, I had already been awake for most of the last 24 hours. I got a genuinely solid sleep in the MiQ seat, which was also a nod to the comfort of the product.

The flight landed shortly thereafter in Seattle, parking at a remote stand on the edge of the airport.

Despite a bus ride and a walk from the farthest reaches of the terminal, I didn’t beat the bags. Luckily, they still appeared some thirty minutes later on the carousel, having likewise completed the long journey from Dubai via Frankfurt.

A shuttered lounge, underwhelming catering, lack of premium touch, and an initially broken IFE system were a disappointing way to close out my long trip home. But I suspect that many of these issues were just bad luck.

The hard product was quite impressive. And if I’d chosen a different seat number or a different main meal, things would’ve almost certainly gone differently.

Qantas picks Airbus for fleet refresh - PaxEx.Aero,"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vcGF4ZXguYWVyby9xYW50YXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjFuZW8tYTIyMC1vcmRlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The next several decades of flying will see a lot of Airbus planes in the skies over Australia. Qantas announced its intention today to renew its single-aisle fleet with a mix of up to 134 A220 and A320neo family aircraft. These new orders and options – still to be finalized – come on top of a significant existing order book for its JetStar brand. The total backlog for the company is listed at 299 aircraft for the decade ahead.

This is a clear sign of our confidence in the future and we’ve locked in pricing just ahead of what’s likely to be a big uptick in demand for next-generation narrow-body aircraft. That’s good news for our customers, our people and our shareholders. – Qantas CEO Alan Joyce

The agreement covers 134 firm orders and options, with deliveries beginning in FY2024 and extending for a decade. Details on the first 40 aircraft from the order, split 20/20 between the A321XLR and A220-300, are expected to be finalized by the end of FY2022. The order still requires approval from the Qantas Board of Directors, as well as an agreement with employee unions regarding operating the types.

These aircraft will replace the 737-800 and 717 currently flying for the company.

CEO Alan Joyce was clear that flexibility from Airbus in terms of specific aircraft models to be delivered was a key factor in the decision. “We can continue to choose between the entire A320neo and A220 families depending on our changing needs in the years ahead,” he explained. “The ability to combine the Jetstar and Qantas order for the A320 type was also a factor.”

Joyce also called out a “next-generation cabin” coming to these planes with improvements for passengers. Details are expected in the months ahead.

Choosing the A321XLR for the first tranche of deliveries raises some questions about the carrier’s intent in terms of routes served. The type is optimized for increased range, including an additional fuel tank on board. That makes it heavier and more expensive to operate than a typical A321neo on short-haul, trunk routes such as the Sydney-Brisbane-Melbourne triangle. Yet that is the market the company identified in its release as a launch pad for these new planes.

The XLR can carry around 15 per cent more passengers on each flight than the airline’s existing B737-800s, making it well suited to busy routes between capital cities like Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.

That also suggests a 200-seat configuration far more than most airlines are considering for the XLR when planning to operate it on truly long-haul routes.

Qantas has the flexibility to swap the specific A320neo family aircraft type around, so maybe these won’t be XLRs to start. Or maybe the company is waiting to negotiate with pilots and flight attendants on work rules that would enable the longer routes before starting to make those choices. But if the XLRs end up mostly flying that triangle of routes that would be a very interesting fleet planning choice.

Both types will be powered by Pratt & Whitney GTF engines, offering a double-digit reduction in fuel burn compared to prior generation aircraft.
