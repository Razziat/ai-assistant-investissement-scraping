"Airbus' 'flying taxi' isn't much to look at, but it's a major step toward electric flight - The Verge","Thu, 22 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDE4LzIvMjIvMTcwMzY3NTAvYWlyYnVzLXZhaGFuYS1mbHlpbmctdGF4aS1lbGVjdHJpYy1maXJzdC1mbGlnaHTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Last month, aerospace giant Airbus conducted the first successful test flight of its Vahana electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. At the time, Airbus only provided still photos to prove its claim of 53 seconds of hovering. But now we’ve got a video, and... yep, still just 53 seconds of hovering.

At first glance, it’s not much to look at: an egg-shaped cabin perched on landing skids with eight rotors and wings that tilt up or forward for vertical or horizontal flight. It’s the kind of thing many people would dismiss as an up-jumped drone, or a very confused helicopter. But the Alpha One prototype is a huge departure from Airbus’ traditional lineup of aircraft. And with an all-electric motor, it represents a pretty major breakthrough for battery-powered flight.

a huge departure from Airbus’ traditional lineup of aircraft

Airbus has said it wants to build a fleet of autonomous, multirotor eVTOL aircraft that can be used to fly from rooftop to rooftop in dense cities where traffic is often at a standstill. The project launched in early 2016 as one of the first pursuits of A³ (pronounced “A cubed”), its Silicon Valley-based subsidiary. (Vahana is a Sanskrit word that refers to the vehicle or mount of a god.)

“Our goal is to democratize personal flight by leveraging the latest technologies such as electric propulsion, energy storage, and machine vision,” Zach Lovering, project executive at Vahana, said in a recent blog post. “Our first flights mark a huge milestone for Vahana as well as the global pursuit of urban air mobility.”

The reason Airbus’ efforts here are notable is because, simply put, there are no electric-powered aircraft, or even gas-electric hybrid aircraft, in commercial operation today. Flying requires an incredible amount of energy, and present battery technology just doesn’t offer the power-to-weight ratio needed to achieve liftoff. Most experts predict that it will be years, if not decades, before the technology catches up.

Vahana isn’t Airbus’ only play in the electric flight. The European aerospace giant announced last year that it was partnering with Rolls-Royce and Siemens on a hybrid electric aircraft prototype, the E-Fan X, that will prove the mixture of conventional and electric engines will work. Airbus flew a demonstrator version of the E-Fan across the English Channel in 2015, but then later scrapped the project. The new version is currently slated to fly sometime in 2020.

So for a public company like Airbus (market cap $76 billion), with all its stockholders and board members, to be invested in a ludicrous-sounding venture like “flying taxis,” it can’t help but feel like we’re on the cusp of some major breakthroughs. Just look at Ehang, the Chinese drone company, which recently demonstrated its own electric, autonomous, passenger-carrying quadcopter. Or Volocopter, which aims to launch an electric flying taxi service in Dubai soon. Or Zunum Aero, the electric jet startup backed by Boeing and JetBlue.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996846914291382}",neutral,0.9996846914291382,0
Airbus' Vahana Makes Its First Flight—And Now Must Defeat Bureaucracy - WIRED,"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9haXJidXMtdmFoYW5hLWZpcnN0LWZsaWdodC1mYWEtY2VydGlmaWNhdGlvbi1mbHlpbmctY2Fycy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At 8:52 on the morning of January 31, eight buzzing rotors lifted a black bubble of an aircraft off the ground for the first time. About 20 feet from nose to tail and the same from wingtip to wingtip, Vahana spent 53 seconds aloft, under its own power and autonomous control. It reached a height of 16 feet, looming over the runway at Oregon's Pendleton UAS Test Range like a gigantisized quadcopter drone.

The flight may not sound like much, but the team from Airbus’ Silicon Valley outpost, A^3, and aerospace experts say such flights of experimental aircraft mark the start of a fundamental change in the way we get around.

“The revolution of aviation we see today is comparable to the jet age,” says Jim Gregory, director of the Aerospace Research Center at The Ohio State University.

Alpha One, as this prototype is dubbed, is a full-scale demonstrator of a single-person, vertical take-off and landing aircraft. The idea behind this thing and its many competitors is to remake the way we fly. Instead of piling dozens or hundreds of people into big jets that fly back and forth between airports, these little VTOL aircraft would work much like personal cars, taking a few people (or just one) on short trips in and around cities, making full use of the third dimension to blast traffic jams into the past. (This is why we dig the term ""flying car""—even if the things don't drive on the ground, they serve the function of a car, and they fly.)

Thirty Vahana engineers worked for two years to make their aircraft ready for its January flight. Just after sunrise, about half a dozen people crowded into the control room to watch. “I remember holding my breath for what felt like an eternity, my heart rate must have gone up two or three times,” says project lead Zach Lovering. When the vehicle safely touched down again, it was hugs and cheers all around. “Light aircraft are a bit of a special creature, they require every system to function appropriately to even get off the ground, let alone land safely,” Lovering says—meaning this test was make or break.

A hallmark moment to be sure, but now the Vahana team faces a challenge more beguiling than making this funky thing fly: convincing the bureaucrats to let it loose in American skies.

It's the job of the Federal Aviation Administration to keep us safe when we fly, and that includes keeping a tight grip over what kinds of machines can be used in commercial service. Right now, Airbus' Vahana is so different from existing aircraft—it blends aspects of planes and helicopters—the FAA doesn't have a classification for it. That's why FAA representatives were in Oregon for the test flight, watching over the engineers' shoulders. They're the folks anyone hoping to lift you up and over traffic needs to impress, and everyone moving into this new airspace knows it.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999393224716187}",neutral,0.9999393224716187,0

Airbus-built PAZ radar satellite successfully launched - Airbus,"Thu, 22 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wMi1haXJidXMtYnVpbHQtcGF6LXJhZGFyLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1zdWNjZXNzZnVsbHktbGF1bmNoZWTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Spain’s first radar satellite will start operations in May 2018

Airbus engineers to support LEOP and IOT phases

PAZ will join the Airbus high resolution SAR satellite constellation

Madrid, 22/02/2018 – The Airbus-built PAZ radar satellite has been successfully launched today from Vandenberg Air Force Base, in California, USA. Ten minutes after launch, the satellite separated from the launcher and will soon be positioned at its 514 km orbit.



First contact with the satellite was established from the DLR Ground Control Centre in Germany, where Airbus engineers are supporting the Launch and Early Orbit Phase (LEOP) to check out and configure the satellite, ensuring that all satellite critical systems and communications are functioning as planned. These activities will take around five days, then the satellite will be handed over to the Ground Control Centre located at INTA (Instituto Nacional de Técnicas Aeroespaciales) in Torrejón de Ardóz, near Madrid. The satellite will be operated by INTA and Hisdesat (owner of the satellite) technical teams.

During the next three months all In-Orbit Testing (IOT) activities will be carried out from Madrid, and will serve to validate the correct functioning of the spacecraft and its radar performance. The verification of the two secondary payloads, the sophisticated Automatic Identification System (AIS) for global control of the maritime scenario and the Radio Occultation and Heavy Precipitation experiment (ROHP), will be carried out.

As prime contractor, Airbus Spain built the PAZ satellite, leading a team of 15 European companies and three universities. “PAZ is the first Spanish radar satellite and has now joined the TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X satellites. Operating on the same orbit, the three satellites form a very high-resolution SAR constellation providing reduced revisit time and increased acquisition capacity,” said Nicolas Chamussy, Head of Space Systems within Airbus. “PAZ is another good example of the advanced technologies that Airbus has to offer to improve our everyday lives. Environment monitoring, management of natural resources, urban and agricultural planning and crisis evaluation are just a few examples of the numerous applications this satellite will be used for.”

PAZ is equipped with advanced active SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) technology designed for high flexibility and the capability to operate in multiple modes with different image sizes and resolutions. It will take images 24/7 and in all weather conditions. PAZ is designed for a mission life time of five and a half years, serving both Spanish government and commercial needs. The initial investment made in the project was 160 million euros.

The new constellation will be jointly exploited by Hisdesat and Airbus. PAZ data will also be used as part of Copernicus, the European Union’s Earth monitoring programme.

Electric self-piloted Airbus VTOL aircraft completes first full-scale test flight - New Atlas,"Thu, 01 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy12dG9sLXZhaGFuYS1maXJzdC10ZXN0LWZsaWdodC81MzIyOC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The race is most certainly heating up in the world of autonomous flying taxis. From the Intel-backed Volocopter's recent debut at CES to Ehang's autonomous passenger drone, what seemed like a crazy sci-fi idea just a few short years ago is rapidly becoming reality. The latest leap forward comes from Airbus and A³ with the first successful, full-scale test flight of its single passenger, self-piloted, electric VTOL aircraft called Vahana.

The Vahana project is relatively new compared to much of its competition with Airbus only launching the project two short years ago. To move from concept sketch on a napkin to a working prototype in such a short time is undeniably a remarkable achievement.

In late 2017, the Vahana team moved to this hangar at the Eastern Oregon Regional Airport Vahana.aero

The full-scale aircraft tested was dubbed Alpha One and its first flight was completely self-piloted, lasting 53 seconds and reaching a modest height of 5 m (16 ft). The test aircraft measured 5.7 m (18.7 ft) long, 6.2 m (20.3 ft) wide and 2.8 m (9.2 ft) high and had a takeoff weight of 745 kg (1,642 lb). The next stages for testing will involve transitioning from vertical to forward flight.

There are undeniably many hurdles, both technically and regulatory, that need to be overcome before these things are set loose in the airspace over our cities ,but the pace of development seen in the Vahana, and others, is truly startling. So much so, it isn't unreasonable to expect to see autonomous flying taxis in our skies within the next 10 years.

The Phony War Between Airbus and Boeing - france-amerique.com,"Thu, 01 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZnJhbmNlLWFtZXJpcXVlLmNvbS90aGUtcGhvbnktd2FyLWJldHdlZW4tYWlyYnVzLWFuZC1ib2Vpbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus was long thought of as the baby of the two businesses. The aircraft manufacturer was founded in 1970 as a joint-venture between France, West Germany, the U.K., and Spain, and long struggled to break into the American market. The U.S. companies swore by Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, who had forged their reputations building bombers during World War II.

Airbus won an initial victory in 1984, when its factories in Toulouse received an order for 28 aircraft for Pan Am, a company that had been a faithful Boeing customer until then. The New York Times praised the decision, proclaiming the European group that had “struggled for a decade to penetrate the American aircraft market,” had succeeded its “coup.” The Europeans triumphed once again in 2009 when Delta Air Lines diversified its suppliers and placed an order with Airbus.

The duopoly now dominates the global air transport market, and the press still like to play on the rivalry and kinship between the two companies. At aviation trade shows in Le Bourget (France), Farnborough (England), Dubai, and Singapore, Airbus and Boeing go head to head in tireless “rounds of negotiations.” But this sales war has no winner. “Since the early 2000s, Airbus has performed just as well as Boeing,” says Bruno Trévidic, aviation specialist for the French daily Les Echos. “The boom in low-cost airlines has played into the hands of Airbus, a company renowned for its mid-haul aircraft, whereas the development of the intercontinental transport sector has helped Boeing, the leader of the long-haul segment.

The statistics confirm the balance. American Airlines – the biggest company of its kind – owns just as many Airbus as Boeing planes. Delta Air Lines, the second-largest, launches one Airbus for every two Boeings, while Air France-KLM, the fifth market leader, prefers two Airbus for every three Boeing. The U.S. manufacturer finished 2017 with 912 commercial aircraft ordered and 763 machines delivered, while its European counterpart totaled 1,109 orders and 718 deliveries.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8690987229347229}",neutral,0.8690987229347229,0
"Boeing displaces Airbus at Hawaiian, wins 787-9 deal; airline cancels A330-800 order - Leeham News and Analysis","Tue, 20 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxOC8wMi8yMC9ib2VpbmctZGlzcGxhY2VzLWFpcmJ1cy1oYXdhaWlhbi13aW5zLTc4Ny05LWRlYWwtYWlybGluZS1jYW5jZWxzLWEzMzAtODAwLW9yZGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Feb. 20, 2018, © Leeham Co.: Boeing has displaced Airbus at Hawaiian Airlines, winning an order for 787-9s. Hawaiian canceled an order for six A330-800s, the only order on the books for this sub-type.

An announcement could come as early as this week.

The campaign has been underway for months and the outcome was expected. Airbus offered to cut the price on the -800 and also offered the A350-900. The latter always was considered too big by carrier executives.

Boeing’s effort to displace Airbus A330neo at Hawaiian is part of an all-out, hand-to-hand combat campaign by Boeing to kill the A330neo program in advance of the potential launch of the Boeing 797.

LNC detailed the battle here.

Winning Hawaiian

Information obtained by LNC over several months, concurrent with the Hawaiian contest, indicated Boeing appeared to be winning over airline executives.

Although not directly related to the campaign, Boeing Capital Corp agreed to release Hawaiian from three 767-300ER leases well in advance of the termination dates. Hawaiian’s desires to exit the 767 fleet had been stated publicly many times.

The airplanes are going to United Airlines. This was described to LNC as not a sweetener to win the 787 order, but the favor by BCC clearly was a psychological link. BCC was under no obligation to terminate the leases early.

LNC is told Boeing “was determined to win at any cost.” Boeing bid below Airbus’ cost of building the airplanes, LNC is told, though it’s unclear whether this was below the cost of the A330-800 or the A350-900. Since Hawaiian wanted out of the A330 contract, because it was the only customer for the airplane, the context suggest the Boeing price was below the cost of the A350-900.

Shades of Bombardier trade case

This form of aggressive pricing by Boeing and the desire to keep a competitor out of the US has parallels to the trade complaint Boeing filed against Bombardier over the Delta Air Lines CSeries order.

Boeing acknowledged it offered extremely aggressive pricing to sell 65 737-700s to United Airlines to block a sale by BBD to UA for the CS100. Although Boeing wasn’t even in the competition that was being run between BBD and Embraer, Boeing swooped in with an offer for a reported $22m and won the order. (Ancillary deals involving the 777-300ER and the 787 were also involved, LNC was told at the time.)

At Delta, Boeing—which didn’t offer any 737 in this competition—charged Bombardier with price dumping. Bombardier responded that it was a special launch customer price for a key airline in the US market.

Boeing argued that launch customer pricing for an eight-year old aircraft program is nonsense. But the 787 program is now 14 years old and if the alleged pricing below the cost to produce the Airbus is true, then Boeing offered the 787-9 for something less than $115m and perhaps less than $100m

The normal sales price of a 787-9 is in the $125m range, market intelligence indicates. The cost to produce a 787-9 is now believed to be between $80m and $90m, Wall Street analysts suggest.

AirAsiaX

Boeing made a similarly aggressive move to persuade another A330neo customer to switch. AirAsiaX has 60 A330-900s on order, a big chunk of the backlog. If Boeing succeed in persuading AirAsiaX to switch, the A330neo program would have been seriously hurt.

The airline announced at the Singapore Air Show it was sticking with the A330neo.

As LNC described in its Feb. 8 post, Airbus hopes to sell the A330neo to United and American Airlines. Boeing wants the carriers to be launch customers for the 797. If Boeing wins these two campaigns, the A330neo will be dealt a serious blow.

Airbus said its full-scale aircraft made two short flights on Wednesday. The self-piloted aircraft climbed 16 feet before successfully returning to the ground after the 53 second trip. The Vahana flew again on Thursday, the company said in a statement.

The test flights took place at the Pendleton Unmanned Aerial Systems Range in Oregon.

The 20.3 foot-long and 18.7-foot wide Vahana is designed to take off and land vertically in a small area. It has helicopter-like struts, and two sets of tilting wings each with four electric motors. There's room for a passenger under a canopy that retracts like a motorcycle helmet visor.

Airbus offers a keep at its flying taxi

The project is part of Airbus's expansion into new flying technologies through its silicon valley unit, A3 (pronounced A-cubed).

Unlike the slow and years-long process of designing, building and testing Airbus's airliners, Vahana's first flight comes just 24 months after A3 's founding.

""In just under two years, Vahana took a concept sketch on a napkin and built a full-scale, self-piloted aircraft that has successfully completed its first flight,"" said Zach Lovering, project executive of Vahana.

Future tests will further validate the company's technology and the prototype will eventually test the transition from hovering a few feet off the ground to forward flight. Vahana has to master that transition if it wants to fly passengers from the rooftops of skyscrapers in crowded cities.

Vahana executives have said they hope to have a more refined version of Vahana ready to sell in 2020.

""Our goal is to democratize personal flight by leveraging the latest technologies such as electric propulsion, energy storage, and machine vision,"" said Lovering in a Medium Post about the first flights.

Uber's Elevate project cited the Vahana project as a possible candidate to move the company beyond ground transportation and transform how people get around cities.

Airbus's chief rival, Boeing, is also rapidly advancing technology for future air taxis. The aerospace giant last year acquired Aurora Flight Sciences, a maker of automated drones and aviation parts.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.99937504529953}",neutral,0.99937504529953,0

When a customer receives a commercial aircraft produced by Airbus at its Toulouse, France-area facilities – home to final assembly lines for the A320, A330 and A350 XWB jetliner families – they can be sure that the highest level of care went into to applying their livery, which is a critically-important element of an operator’s identity.

At the heart of Airbus’ Toulouse paint centre are its more than 300 operators and 120 support function members – who work together in harmony across the facility’s 13 separate paint halls to apply the special colour schemes and logos on more than 350 jetliners delivered each year.

Meeting the needs of Airbus customers

The Toulouse paint shop is well-equipped to meet the varied customer designs and changing production rates of today and tomorrow. According to Head of Paint Jean-François Paul, this is due in large part to the support function members – who work in close partnership with the final assembly teams, supply chain personnel and programmes management so they can quickly adapt to changes.

He added: “Inside the paint centre, meetings take place on a daily basis to anticipate the variations and manage the quality, lead times and costs. The fact that our teams are strongly engaged gives us such flexibility.”

The 13 paint halls are organised by programmes, providing capacity for both the single-aisle and widebody product lines. And when production schedules require even more capacity, the Toulouse paint team knows they can rely on Hamburg, Germany – home to additional A320 Family final assembly lines – to handle some of the painting.

Airbus’ Toulouse paint centre is part of a network of painting facilities at the company’s final assembly sites, which also include Hamburg, Germany; Tianjin, China; and Mobile, Alabama, USA.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.827290952205658}",neutral,0.827290952205658,0

Vahana, the all electric, self-piloted, VTOL aircraft from A³ by Airbus, today announced the successful completion of its first full-scale flight test, reaching a height of 5 meters (16 feet) before descending safely. The test was completed at 8:52AM Pacific on January 31, 2018at the Pendleton UAS Range in Pendleton, Oregon. Its first flight, with a duration of 53 seconds, was fully self-piloted and the vehicle completed a second flight the following day.

“Today we are celebrating a great accomplishment in aerospace innovation,” said Zach Lovering, Project Executive of Vahana. “In just under two years, Vahana took a concept sketch on a napkin and built a full-scale, self-piloted aircraft that has successfully completed its first flight. Our team is grateful for the support we’ve received from A³ and the extended Airbus family, as well as our partners including MTSI and the Pendleton UAS Range.”



Vahana is a project developed at A³, the Silicon Valley outpost of Airbus. A³ enables access to unique talent and ideas, new partnership opportunities, and execution at speed. Vahana aims to democratize personal flight and answer the growing need for urban mobility by leveraging the latest technologies in electric propulsion, energy storage, and machine vision.



“Vahana’s first flight demonstrates Airbus’ unique ability to pursue ambitious ideas quickly, without compromising the quality and safety for which the company is well-known. For A³, it proves that we can deliver meaningful innovation with aggressive project timetables, to provide a real competitive advantage for Airbus,” said Rodin Lyasoff, A³ CEO and former Project Executive of Vahana. “Our focus now is on celebrating the work of the tireless Vahana team while maintaining the momentum of this accomplishment.”



Vahana leverages its self-piloted capabilities to operate without a passenger. Following these successful hover flights, the team will turn to additional testing, including transitions and forward flight.

This replaces previous national approvals from France, Germany and Spain by a single, integrated framework allowing for simplified industrial exchanges between Airbus Helicopters’ manufacturing facilities and supporting the company’s industrial strategy of site specialisation across Europe.

“The implementation of the single POA allows us to work as a truly integrated company, and ensures that our various sites are no longer considered as each other’s suppliers from a regulatory perspective”, said Christian Cornille, Airbus Helicopters Executive Vice-President Industry. “I would like to congratulate our teams and thank EASA for their support in achieving this milestone which will streamline certification processes associated to our manufacturing activities, create synergies and improve our competitiveness.”

“A Single POA is of great value for Airbus Helicopters as it ensures continuity of its production procedures across its various European production sites and according to Europe’s highest safety standards” said Ralf Erckmann EASA’s deputy Flight Standards Director. “It is also a proof that EASA and the European National Aviation Authorities work hand in hand for the benefit of the European aviation industry and its customers.”

Since June 2016, Airbus Helicopters is also operating under a single Design Organisation Approval (DOA) from EASA which has simplified and harmonized development processes and facilitated the implementation of an increased transnational approach to certification, including through the establishment of a unified airworthiness office within Airbus Helicopters.

French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on Sunday hailed the signing in Dubai of a $16 billion purchase by Emirates Airlines of the Airbus A380 superjumbo commercial airliner.

""This is obviously excellent news for the French aerospace industry and for the European industry as a whole, as it allows Airbus to consider continuing production of the A380,"" the visiting premier told reporters on the sidelines of the World Government Summit.

The deal was signed by Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the Emirates chairman and CEO of Emirates, and Mikhail Houari, president of Airbus Middle East.

In December, Emirates agreed to buy 20 of the double-decker aircraft with an optional 16 more, just days after the European manufacturer said it would have to halt production if no new orders were received.

The economics of the 853-seat, four-engine A380 have proved daunting, with airlines having to operate every flight at full capacity in order to make a profit.

The Emirates order was in question after the November Dubai Airshow, when the UAE airline inked a deal with competitor Boeing to buy 40 Dreamliners for more than $15 billion.

Sunday's closing of the deal represents a lifeline for Airbus.

A major transcontinental air routes transit hub, Dubai is one of several Gulf-based airports to have experienced prodigious growth in recent years.

Dubai airport was the world's busiest for international passengers in 2017 for the fourth year running, with 88.2 million travellers.

Looking only at the A320neo family vs the 737 MAX, Airbus had a 59% market share of the backlog at Dec. 31. Adding the ceo and the NG makes no difference; there was only one airplane difference between them.

The addition of the 737-10 to the MAX family, coming at mid-year, only marginally helped Boeing: there were about 150 incremental orders after swaps from the 737-8 and 737-9, launching the program at the Paris Air Show.

The shortcomings of the MAX 7, in our view, have been discussed many times, so I won’t repeat them here. Its future is that of a niche airplane for airlines, a BBJ and as a military transport, in our view.

The MAX 9 was getting killed by the Airbus A321neo sales, so Boeing launched the MAX 10. LNC has written that the MAX 10 gave Boeing a product that’s on an economic par with the A321neo (Boeing and Airbus each claim the advantage; our independent analysis shows there is “economic indifference” between the two.) It was creation of the MAX 10 that put Boeing in the race for the Delta Air Lines order, which ultimately went to Airbus, but which was a highly competitive race.

But the MAX 10 has field performance issues that can’t match the A321neo, giving the latter airplane its historic advantage over the MAX 9.

While Boeing sharply trails Airbus today in market share, this is, perhaps, a bit misleading. A far larger percentage of A320 family operators ordered the neo compared with a smaller number of 737NG operators. Based on this alone, Boeing has more upside to regain market share than Airbus has to maintain its lead.

Airbus needs to grow the market for the neo, which it can do at the lower end of the Middle of the Market sector with the A321neo—something Boeing can’t do with the MAX 10.

Emerging competitors

Boeing’s market share looks worse, however, when the emerging competitors in the single-aisle sector are factored in.

Airbus’ commanding lead over Boeing shrinks slightly when these competitors are factored in.

Bombardier and Embraer cover the low end of this sector, 100-150 seats, that Airbus and Boeing essentially have exited. The A319neo and 737-7 are largely rejected by the market.

The COMAC C919 and Irkut MC-21 don’t have much market penetration and as yet are restricted by market forces to their home countries.

None of these four OEMs command more than 3% of the backlog of new generation aircraft. Collectively, they capture 10% of the market. This reduces Airbus’ share to 53% of the single-aisle backlog and Boeing to just 37%.

(If Bombardier’s C Series is lumped in with Airbus, pending the acquisition of 50.01% of the program, Airbus’ share climbs to 56% of the six OEMs.)

It’s a surprisingly low showing for the venerable 737.

Boeing needs to new airplane to replace the 737. However, with a MAX backlog of more than 4,000 aircraft, Boeing isn’t hurting. In fact, the financial results from the 737 program, along with the increasing cash flow from the 787 program, are staples of Boeing’s financial performance.

Wide-bodies

Last year was Boeing’s year for wide-bodies. Boeing captured 77% of the firm orders and announced commitments for many more. The Emirates Airline order for 40 787s, announced at the Dubai Air Show in November, wasn’t booked into last year’s tally.

Boeing ended the year under a 1:1 book:bill for the 787—it hasn’t won more orders than deliveries since 2013. Had the EK order been firmed up, the 1:1 would have been reached. But the deal gives Boeing a good jump-start on this year’s contracts, when it’s firmed up.

The 777 did well, logging 70 orders—43 for the -300ER, 20 for the 777X and eight freighters.

In all, there were 208 orders for all types.

Airbus trailed badly, with just 63 orders, adjusted for the cancellation of two A380s. The A350 won 40 orders. The A330ceo won 15 and the A330neo won 10.

The A330neo continues to struggle in a low-price fuel environment.

However, as badly as Airbus was thumped last year, the backlogs are close: Airbus has 1,123 wide-bodies in backlog at December 31; Boeing has 1,158.

Europe's Airbus-built Columbus orbital outpost: 10 years in space - Airbus,"Tue, 06 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE4LTAyLWV1cm9wZXMtYWlyYnVzLWJ1aWx0LWNvbHVtYnVzLW9yYml0YWwtb3V0cG9zdC0xMC15ZWFycy1pbi1zcGFjZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The space station module underscores Airbus' European leadership in human space flight

Circling the Earth every 90 minutes since its launch in February 2008, the Airbus-built Columbus module serves as a well-equipped research environment for astronauts working aboard the International Space Station. As importantly, this 6.9-metre-long laboratory demonstrates the company’s leadership in creating and supporting European-made systems that contribute to exploration of space as the final frontier…today and for the future.

Airbus was prime contractor for Columbus, overseeing a large consortium of companies from 10 European nations to develop and build the module – also providing its life support system, and continuing to supply experiments and associated racks for operation.

Columbus marked an important milestone for Airbus, building on the company’s experience gained in developing and building the predecessor Spacelab – a laboratory that was carried 22 times in the payload bay of space shuttle orbiters beginning in 1983. Spacelab missions provided new perspectives in research and space-based industrial activities, involving cutting-edge experiments for such fields as new materials, the processing of pharmaceutical products and astronomical observation.

Impressive numbers for Columbus in orbit

While Spacelab missions were constrained by the limits of its space shuttle carriers’ flight duration in orbit, Columbus serves as a long-term laboratory, remaining attached to the International Space Station during its operational lifetime. Columbus already has logged some impressive statistics: circling the globe nearly 60,000 times; with some 1,800 experiments performed in the microgravity conditions of low Earth orbit.

Airbus’ contributions to human spaceflight also included its overall industrial responsibility for Europe’s Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) – a cargo spacecraft used to resupply the International Space Station. The most complex spacecraft ever developed and constructed in Europe, ATVs were launched by Ariane 5 rockets, and maneuvered using their autonomous rendezvous and docking system to meet up with the International Space Station.

A total of five Automated Transfer Vehicles were produced and deployed from 2008 to 2015, with the final ATV remaining attached to the International Space Station for more than 200 days. After performing the duties of bringing cargo such as water, food, air, fuel, clothing and hardware to the International Space Station, each of these space freighters were undocked and guided to a controlled destructive reentry in the Earth’s atmosphere.

Columbus is a pressurized laboratory with its own independent life support system. It's one of the primary European contributions to the International Space Station (ISS) that was built and is being operated by Airbus.

Lunar missions…and beyond…with Orion

Looking to the future, Airbus now is applying its expertise in crewed space flight to a new adventure: the travel of humans to the Moon and beyond. The company is prime contractor for the European Service Module (ESM), which will be launched for a first uncrewed flight end of 2019 with NASA’s new Space Systems Launch vehicle.

To be located below Orion’s crew module, the European Service Module will supply power, propulsion, thermal control, water and air for future deep-space missions. The ESM is the first system-critical element to be entrusted by the U.S. NASA space agency to an international partner

Current planning calls for Orion to perform its first flight with an astronaut crew in 2022/2023 at the earliest. This will open the way for lunar missions and beyond, with the optional aim of reaching an asteroid and perhaps Mars in the 2030s – ensuring that Airbus will continue its role in exploration to probe the mysteries of space.

Alexander Gerst will test the technology demonstrator aboard the ISS Watson AI (IBM’s artificial intelligence technology) is designed to support space flight crews

Friedrichshafen / Bremen, 26/02/2018 – Airbus, in cooperation with IBM, is developing CIMON (Crew Interactive MObile CompanioN), an AI-based assistant for astronauts for the DLR Space Administration. The technology demonstrator, which is the size of a medicine ball and weighs around 5 kg, will be tested on the ISS by Alexander Gerst during the European Space Agency’s Horizons mission between June and October 2018.

“In short, CIMON will be the first AI-based mission and flight assistance system,” said Manfred Jaumann, Head of Microgravity Payloads from Airbus. “We are the first company in Europe to carry a free flyer, a kind of flying brain, to the ISS and to develop artificial intelligence for the crew on board the space station.” Pioneering work was also being done in the area of manufacturing, Jaumann continued, with the entire structure of CIMON, which is made up of plastic and metal, created using 3D printing.

CIMON is designed to support astronauts in performing routine work, for example by displaying procedures or – thanks to its ‘neural’ AI network and its ability to learn – offering solutions to problems. It uses Watson AI technology from the IBM cloud and, with its face, voice and artificial intelligence, becomes a genuine ‘colleague’ on board. With CIMON, crew members can do more than just work through a schematic view of prescribed checklists and procedures; they can also engage with their assistant. In this way, CIMON makes work easier for the astronauts when carrying out every day routine tasks, helps to increase efficiency, facilitates mission success and improves security, as it can also serve as an early warning system for technical problems.

Airbus initially examined the concept for the assistance system as part of a self-financed study. Then, in August 2016, the Bonn-based DLR Space Administration commissioned Airbus’ aerospace experts to carry out the project. Since then, a 50-strong project team comprising members from Airbus, DLR, IBM and the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität Munich (LMU) has been working to ensure that CIMON takes shape and is brought to life: the system is learning to orientate itself and move around, it accumulates knowledge with the help of Watson AI technology and is training to recognise its human partners.

Amongst other things, the Watson AI was trained using voice samples and photos of Alexander Gerst, and procedures and plans of the Columbus module of the International Space Station were loaded into the database. Alexander Gerst also had a say in the selection of CIMON’s screen face and computer voice so that he, too, could ‘make friends’ with his electronic colleague.

Once the functional testing of the system has been completed, Gerst will work in Space with CIMON a total of three times: They will experiment with crystals, work together to solve the Rubik’s cube and perform a complex medical experiment using CIMON as an ‘intelligent’ flying camera.

In its first Space mission, CIMON will only be equipped with a selected range of capabilities. In the medium term, aerospace researchers also plan to use the CIMON project to examine group effects that can develop over a long period of time in small teams and that may arise during long-term missions to the Moon or Mars. Social interaction between people and machines, between astronauts and assistance systems equipped with emotional intelligence, could play an important role in the success of long-term missions. Airbus’ developers are convinced that, here on Earth, developments of the assistance system could also find future use in hospitals and social care.

CIMON will get its first ‘taste of space’ as early as March 2018: the 31st DLR parabolic flight campaign will focus in particular on testing and optimising GNC algorithms (Guidance, Navigation and Control) under zero G conditions.

Airbus to pay 81 mn euros to end German corruption probe (Update) - Phys.org,"Fri, 09 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE4LTAyLWFpcmJ1cy1tbi1ldXJvcy1nZXJtYW4tY29ycnVwdGlvbi5odG1s0gFDaHR0cHM6Ly9waHlzLm9yZy9uZXdzLzIwMTgtMDItYWlyYnVzLW1uLWV1cm9zLWdlcm1hbi1jb3JydXB0aW9uLmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"German prosecutors have ended their probe, but authorities in Austria are are still investigating claims bribers were paid to land the two-billion-euro sale of 18 Eurofighter jets to Vienna

European aircraft manufacturer Airbus on Friday said it had agreed to pay a fine of 81.25 million euros ($99 million) to end a German corruption probe into the 2003 sale of Eurofighter jets to Austria.

Prosecutors in Munich said in a statement that their investigation did not find evidence of bribery to secure the lucrative contract.

But they said Airbus management had failed in its supervisory duty by allowing employees to make multi-million-euro payments linked to the deal for ""unclear purposes"".

The firm said in its own statement it had accepted the fine, meaning that the probe first opened in 2012 ""has been terminated"".

But its legal woes are far from over.

Authorities in Austria are still investigating whether bribes were paid to land the two-billion-euro sale of 18 Eurofighter jets to Vienna.

And the Austrian government last year launched a lawsuit against the company, seeking up to 1.1 billion euros in damages over the Eurofighter purchases.

It accuses Airbus, previously called EADS, of deliberately hoodwinking Vienna over the order, overcharging it to make up for kickbacks and other shady expenses linked to winning the contract.

Current Airbus chief Tom Enders was head of the EADS defence division that negotiated the contract at the time.

The corruption probes in Germany and Austria, as well separate graft investigations in Britain and France, have long cast a pall over one of Europe's most successful and best known companies.

Airbus announced in December that embattled Enders would not seek reappointment when his current term ends in April 2019.

'Major efforts' to do better

The Eurofighter Typhoon is a major prestige product for the European defence industry, with some 500 aircraft delivered so far to Germany, Britain, Italy and Spain, as well as to Austria and Saudi Arabia.

The four founding nations in the consortium—Germany, Spain, Britain and Italy -– all use the planes in their own air forces. Other contracts have been signed with Oman and Kuwait.

Austria was the first country outside the consortium to sign up.

But allegations of graft soon began swirling around the deal.

A first probe was set up in Austria in 2007 and led to the suspension of the then air force chief following revelations that his wife's company had been paid 87,600 euros by a lobbyist.

In 2012, Austrian and German authorities then launched probes to investigate whether officials had been paid millions of euros through advisory firms to secure the contract.

A spokesman for the prosecutor's office in Vienna told Austria's APA news agency that it could not yet say when its investigation would be completed.

The prosecutors in Germany meanwhile said Airbus had fully cooperated with their probe and had improved its internal controls since 2012, ""which is why there is reason to believe such events could not happen again"".

Airbus also said it had made ""major efforts"" to bolster its compliance procedures.

Separately, Britain's Serious Fraud Office and French prosecutors are investigating Airbus for suspected corruption in its UK-based civil aviation arm.

The probes were opened last year after Airbus raised suspicions itself over irregular transactions.

Airbus has since warned that the British and French investigations into possibly irregular payments via middlemen could have a ""material impact"" on its profits and businesses.

• Expands commercial drone business to Asia-Pacific in key sectors

• Bernard Leong appointed Head of Airbus Aerial Asia

Singapore, 7 February 2018 – Airbus has launched the Asia-Pacific operations of its “Airbus Aerial” commercial drone services at the Singapore Airshow 2018. The newly established regional base of Airbus Aerial adds to two existing hubs based in Atlanta, U.S. and Munich, Germany.

“We have chosen Singapore as the headquarters for our Asia-Pacific operations because it is a well-established regional hub with excellent connectivity to key countries such as Australia, India, Japan and China,” said Jana Rosenmann, Head of Unmanned Aerial Systems at Airbus. “It is also a great centre for innovation and potential partnerships, enjoying strong support from the local government for start-ups as well as the development of smart technologies.”

Initially focussing on the development of new imagery services, Airbus Aerial leverages the latest software and aerospace technologies to provide actionable data and analysis of information provided by drones, satellites, high altitude aircraft and other sources. With its imagery services, Airbus Aerial targets a range of applications for industries such as insurance, agriculture, oil and gas and utilities, as well as state and local governments.

During its first year in operation, Airbus Aerial played a critical role in the U.S., helping several major insurance companies assess damage and process claims faster than ever before. These results were achieved by providing before-and-after satellite imagery of affected areas and real-time imagery collected by drones during fly-overs. These images were then blended with proprietary Airbus data analytics to help insurers assess damage and prioritise resources.

These initial services were provided in 2017, following Hurricane Harvey in the Houston, Texas area and Hurricane Irma in southern Florida and, more recently, after the devastating wildfires in California.

The Asia-Pacific base of Airbus Aerial is led by Bernard Leong, who joined Airbus in January 2018. Previously, he was Head of Post Office Network and Digital Services at Singapore Post, with an extensive business and technology management background, including drone delivery and autonomous vehicles within the Asia-Pacific markets.

The first target of the Singapore team will be to explore potential within the Asian regional insurance market and extend Airbus Aerial’s footprint from the U.S. and Europe to the Asia-Pacific region. It will gather information to provide relief and recovery in disaster prone regions with dedicated disaster management support, and also identify local possibilities including agriculture, critical infrastructure monitoring like power lines and railroad, and oil and gas mining where the business model may fit.

Airbus Aerial Asia also aims in the next years to offer cargo drone services with autonomous logistic systems, applying the principle of supporting an open ecosystem while seeking strong partnerships with technology providers and drone operators in the Asian region.

Transatlantic test for Airbus low-cost airliner - Phys.org,"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE4LTAyLXRyYW5zYXRsYW50aWMtYWlyYnVzLWxvdy1jb3N0LWFpcmxpbmVyLmh0bWzSAUhodHRwczovL3BoeXMub3JnL25ld3MvMjAxOC0wMi10cmFuc2F0bGFudGljLWFpcmJ1cy1sb3ctY29zdC1haXJsaW5lci5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A321 neo LR(long range) test plane is making its maiden flight across the Atlantic on Tuesday

The long-range version of Airbus's updated single-aisle aircraft took off Tuesday on a flight from Paris to New York in what could be a boon for low-cost flights across the Atlantic.

The A321neo LR is essentially taking a workhorse of the medium-haul market that is widely used by low-cost airlines and extending its range so it can handle the transatlantic and similar routes.

Airbus believes that the plane will help airlines open new market segments and routes.

""You can look at it as a step towards the democratisation of long-haul flights where a students on a budget could pay just a bit more for a Paris to New York ticket than what they pay now to fly from Paris to Toulouse"" in the south of France,"" said Cedric Favrichon, an engineer on the flight.

Like other Airbus's other 'neo' aircraft, the A321neo LR uses new engines and has other design features meant to conserve considerable amounts of fuel, one of the greatest costs for airlines.

The low-cost sector has yet to make much inroads into the transatlantic segment, partially due to the lack of a suitable aircraft.

The only other single-aisle aircraft that made transatlantic flights, Boeing's 757, is no longer in production and occasionally needed to stop for fuel if winds were strong.

Low-cost Norwegian, which is making transatlantic flights with Boeing's widebody Dreamliner, has ordered 30 A321neo LR aircraft.

Airbus has received more than 100 orders for the aircraft.

The European aircraft maker believes that in addition to transatlantic flights it could also be used for routes such as Dubai-Beijing, Kuala Lumpur-Tokyo or Singapore-Sydney where long-haul carriers are currently needed.

Airbus is hoping to obtain certification from US and EU regulators in the coming months for the aircraft so it may enter service by the end of the year.

Boeing is expected to make a decision this year whether it will launch an aircraft in this segment, which it estimates at some 4,000 aircraft.

Airbus group 2017: The A320 is the group moneymaker despite problems - Leeham News and Analysis,"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxOC8wMi8xNS9haXJidXMtZ3JvdXAtMjAxNy1hMzIwLWdyb3VwLW1vbmV5bWFrZXItZGVzcGl0ZS1wcm9ibGVtcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Bjorn Fehrm

February 15, 2018, ©. Leeham Co in Toulouse: Airbus Group presents better results for 2017 than predicted, despite challenges in several programs. Profit was up 34% on flat revenues. The underlying driver for the strong performance is the A320 program, and with record 2017 orders and backlog, no end is in sight.

Airbus CEO, Tom Enders, says the A320 is “sold out’ until 2023 and the company is working on how to produce 70 per month, to keep up with demand.

2017 group results

The Airbus revenue and net profit were beating guidance at €66.8(66.6)bn (2017 figures followed by 2016 in brackets) and €3.4(2.3)bn respectively. Results, like last year, were cut by one-time charges of €1.3bn for A400M and €0.1bn compliance costs, partly compensated by one-time gains of €0.6bn from selling Defense electronics.

The company ended the year with €13.4(11.1)bn in cash, of which €6bn was generated in 4Q2017.

Guidance for 2018

Airbus expects to deliver 800 aircraft during 2018, of which 600 will be A320 series with two-thirds being A320neos and one-third A320ceos. This is contingent on engine deliveries, see below. The higher deliveries of civil aircraft will increase profits by another 20% compared to 2017.

CSeries

The guidance does not include the effects of adding the Bombardier CSeries to Airbus aircraft programs. The joint venture talks are going well according to Enders and the confidence of concluding the cooperation agreement in the second half of 2018 is high.

Aircraft programs

A320

Airbus delivered 182 A320neo aircraft out of a planned 200 during 2017. The balance was filled with A320ceos to a total of 558 A320 deliveries for 2017.

Both neo engine manufacturers had problems during 2017. Pratt & Whitney with the well-known technical problems and CFM with LEAP engine deliveries being late. Despite the troubles with engine deliveries, the A320 program was the undisputed cash engine for the group.

For 2018 the plan is to produce more than 600 A320 aircraft. This is contingent on engines being available. A new problem was detected for the Pratt & Whitney GTF engine last week. About 50 Airbus aircraft are affected by a changed component not performing correctly, causing major engine problems for affected aircraft.

Enders was confident the joint Airbus and Pratt & Whitney team would get on top of this problem as well. How long engine deliveries would be disturbed was too early to tell.

A330

The A330neo is in full flight test with first A330-900 delivery in the summer. The sole A330-800 test aircraft is getting ready for flight test. The program is running at six aircraft per month and will stay at this level until the neo transition is finished. Then the order situation will decide any rate adjustments.

A350

The A350 program has performed better than expected during 2017. Production is running smoothly with traveled work at a record low level, almost on the level of the A330 Final Assembly Line.

Ramp to 10 per month is secured for the end of the year and the program now plans cash positive deliveries beginning end 2019.

A380

Airbus secured a critical order for an additional 20 aircraft from Emirates in January 2018. This secures the program for the next 10 years according to Enders, even without further orders.

Should no additional orders come about, Airbus is prepared to reduce the rate of A380s to six each year. At this level, the program is not profitable but losses are “acceptable” according to Enders. The long-term outlook this gives improves the discussions with existing customers to order more A380 and for new customers, like Chinese airlines, to enter the program says Enders.

A400M

Airbus reached a critical agreement with the six customer nations and their procurement agency, OCCAM, on the 5th of February 2018.

The agreement outlines a realistic production and capability roadmap for the A400M. It also limits the customer’s penalties and withholding of payments for delivered aircraft.

By it, Airbus has planning certainty with limits to future losses. The agreement turns the A400M program from an unpredictable liability to an aircraft program which can be fulfilled by Airbus with acceptable consequences.

Airbus could thank to the agreement make a provision for a €1.3bn charge against 2017 results. This shall be the last large write-off for the program, according to Enders.

The production rate was 15 aircraft for 2017, with 11 planned for 2018. Should no new orders be placed, then the program can continue at a rate of eight A400M per year until new orders arrive.

Aerospace giant Airbus has announced the first successful flight of its self-piloted ""flying car.""

Two years on from the launch of the ""Vahana"" project, a full-scale electric vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) craft reportedly reached a height of 16 feet before landing safely at a site in Pendleton, Oregon.

Airbus said the flight took place Wednesday and lasted 53 seconds. A second flight took place Thursday.

""In just under two years, Vahana took a concept sketch on a napkin and built a full-scale, self-piloted aircraft that has successfully completed its first flight,"" said Zach Lovering, Vahana's project executive, in a press release Friday.

The VTOL is being developed at ""A³,"" the Silicon Valley outpost of Airbus. The explicit aim is to provide commuters with a self-piloted craft that is cost-comparable to using a car or a train.

The Vahana team had previously said it was aiming for speeds as much as four-times faster than road traffic, with a flight range of about 50 miles.

Airbus said the VTOL could in future also perform as a cargo delivery platform, ambulance, search and rescue device or taxi.

The Vahana team developing the drone-like craft said development of ""sense and avoid"" technology would be key to achieving desired safety levels.

Airbus said testing of the VTOL would now move on from hovering to being able to change direction in flight.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9691727757453918}",neutral,0.9691727757453918,0
Airbus profits soar despite new charge on A400M military plane - Phys.org,"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE4LTAyLWFpcmJ1cy1wcm9maXRzLXNvYXItYTQwMG0tbWlsaXRhcnkuaHRtbNIBRGh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE4LTAyLWFpcmJ1cy1wcm9maXRzLXNvYXItYTQwMG0tbWlsaXRhcnkuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus took a new 1.3-billion-euro charge against its A400M four-engine turboprop military transport aircraft

Airbus said Thursday that increased deliveries, windfall gains from divestments and favourable exchange rates enabled profits to take off last year, even though it booked a ""substantial"" new charge on its A400M military transporter plane.

The European aircraft maker said in a statement that net profit nearly tripled to 2.87 billion euros ($3.6 billion) in 2017 from 995 million euros a year earlier.

Full-year sales held steady at 66.8 billion euros.

""We overachieved on all our 2017 key performance indicators thanks to a very good operational performance, especially in the last quarter,"" said chief executive Tom Enders.

""Despite persistent engine issues on the A320neo, we continued the production ramp-up and finally delivered a record number of aircraft,"" he said.

A net capital gain of 604 million euros resulting from the divestment of the defence electronics business and ""a strong positive impact"" from exchange rate developments also helped boost the group's bottom line, it said.

But Airbus booked a new one-off charge of 1.3 billion euros against its A400M turboprop military transport, plagued by delivery problems and technical problems.

""On A400M, we made progress on the industrial and capabilities front and agreed a re-baselining with government customers which will significantly reduce the remaining programme risks. This is reflected in a substantial one-off charge,"" Enders said.

Airbus had already booked a charge of 2.2 billion euros on the A400M in 2016.

Nonetheless, given the ""strength of our 2017 achievements,"" Airbus would propose lifting its dividend to 1.50 euros per share for last year from 1.35 euros a year earlier, Enders said.

""This also endorses our earnings and cash growth story for the future,"" he said.

Airbus has delivered the world’s first A350-1000 widebody airliner to launch customer Qatar Airways at a delivery event in Toulouse, France. The aircraft is the first of 37 A350-1000s ordered by the carrier and is the first ever Airbus aircraft fitted with the revolutionary new Qsuite seats, offering the first ever double bed in Business class. Qatar Airways is the world’s largest A350 XWB family customer with 76 aircraft on order and the largest A350-1000 customer.



“Qatar Airways always demands the very best for its customers, so it is right that we are the first airline in the world to fly the Airbus A350-1000,” said Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, His Excellency Mr. Akbar Al Baker, “This remarkable state-of-the-art aircraft will become a firm part of Qatar Airways fleet and will keep us ahead of the curve, allowing us to continue to offer our passengers outstanding levels of comfort and service”.

The A350-1000 fits seamlessly alongside Qatar Airways’ growing fleet, including 20 A350-900s today. Both aircraft are complementary and provide for maximum commonality with unmatched operating efficiencies and the same unique passenger experience in their Airspace cabin. Flyers will benefit from absolute well-being in the cabin, with more personal space, optimised cabin altitude, more fresh air, controlled temperature & humidity, integrated connectivity and the latest generation of in-flight entertainment system.

Chris Cholerton, Rolls-Royce President – Civil Aerospace, stated “We are very proud to have worked with Qatar Airways and Airbus to deliver engines for this latest version of the A350 XWB family. This delivery marks another significant day in our partnership with the airline and the manufacturer as the new aircraft is powered by the most powerful engine ever developed for an Airbus aircraft, the Trent XWB-97.”

Fabrice Brégier, Airbus, said “It is a huge pride for us to deliver the very first A350-1000 to our launch customer Qatar Airways. Bringing major advantages in fuel and cost efficiency along with unmatched passenger comfort, the A350-1000 is the ideal aircraft to showcase Qatar Airways’ legendary customer service. With its greater capacity compared to the A350-900, the newest widebody will play a major role on the carrier’s busiest long-haul routes and will contribute to strengthen their position at the forefront of the aviation industry.”

The A350-1000 is Airbus’ latest and largest widebody in the twin-aisle category. With a 7-metre longer fuselage, the A350-1000 space for premium cabin products is 40% larger than its smaller sibling the A350-900. In Qatar Airways configuration the A350-1000 offers 44 additional seats. It is a truly long-range aircraft with a range of 8,000nm (14,800 km) at entry into service. The A350-1000 features a modified wing trailing-edge, new six-wheel main landing gears and more powerful Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines. As with the A350-900, the A350-1000 brings together the very latest in aerodynamics, design and advanced technologies for a 25 per cent step change in operating cost compared to previous generation competitor aircraft.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999997615814209}",positive,0.9999997615814209,1

The goal of the initiative is to encourage students between the age of 10 and 16 to understand and embrace technology, and ignite passion that could grow into an exciting career in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.

In the spirit of “think global, act local”, the Airbus Foundation is working with The Travelling Telescope, a local organisation founded by Susan Murabana and Daniel Chu Owen that helps to encourage both children and adults to learn more about astronomy.

Since its launch in 2012, the Airbus Little Engineer programme successfully positioned itself as an effective vehicle for discovery-based learning, working to enlighten and empower youth in the areas of science and technology through robotics and aerospace.

Held in partnership with the M-PESA Foundation Academy, the workshop challenged close to 30 Kenyan students to carry out a simulation of a launch mission to space. It focused on introducing students to the world of space exploration and enhancing their understanding of both the benefits and applications of space technology. Over the course of four hours, students assembled and launched a rocket, set up a base and established communications.

“We want to support and work with Kenyan youth whose innovative and high-tech spirit is getting stronger with many small and medium sized companies, social entrepreneurs and local non-profit organizations,” said Andrea Debbane, Executive Director of the Airbus Foundation. “The Airbus Little Engineer programme helps to facilitate access to STEM skills which are crucial in solving the complex problems of today. I would like to thank all partners for joining efforts and making this project possible in Kenya.”

“We are very excited to be partnering with the Airbus Foundation and The Travelling Telescope. The Airbus Little Engineer initiative fits well into how we approach education at the M-PESA Foundation Academy where we focus on leadership, technology, entrepreneurship training and co-curricular activities alongside academic learning,” said Les Baillie, CEO of the M-PESA Foundation.

Like in many African countries, in Kenya the youth will be the driving force behind sustainable growth across the country. According to the UN, in Kenya the small and medium-sized enterprises play a key role in the economic development, contributing 33.8% of GDP and 81.1% of employment opportunities. Most of these enterprises are run by young people aged between 18 and 35. Therefore, investment in education and training is essential in building an educated and skilled workforce. With the Airbus Little Engineer initiative, the Airbus Foundation aims at supporting the countries’ efforts in creating a sustainable pipeline of talent for Africa.

This inaugural flight demonstration follows the launch of the experimental project with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) in February 2016 to develop an urban unmanned air system to address the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of the air delivery business in cities such as Singapore. The collaboration was subsequently extended in April 2017 with Singapore Post (SingPost) becoming the local logistics partner to the project.

Airbus Helicopters is the overall Skyways system architect and provider, contributing its capabilities in drone platforms as well as its concept of future parcel delivery. This concept involves systems and structures that allow drones to land, dock with secure structures, discharge or take on payloads, and then fly off to other destinations.

“Today’s flight demonstration paves the way positively to our local trial service launch in the coming months. It is the result of a very strong partnership among the stakeholders involved, especially the close guidance and confidence from the CAAS,” said Alain Flourens, Airbus Helicopters’ Executive Vice President of Engineering and Chief Technical Officer. “Safe and reliable urban air delivery is a reality not too distant into the future, and Airbus is certainly excited to be a forerunner in this endeavour.”

Airbus Helicopters is at an advanced stage of the Skyways project. The research and development phase is progressing well, with equipment and facilities installed at the NUS campus. Various tests are already underway, and the unmanned air system will be demonstrated in the university when the trial service commences this year. Campus students and staff will be able to make use of Skyways to have small parcels between 2kg and 4kg delivered to designated parcel stations within the campus, which is the size of 150 football fields.

“The Skyways project is an important innovation for the aviation industry. CAAS has been working closely with Airbus on the project, with an emphasis on co-developing systems and rules to ensure that such aircraft can operate in an urban environment safely and optimally. For Singapore, this project will help to develop innovative rules to support the development of the unmanned aircraft industry in Singapore. We are pleased with the good progress that Skyways is making and look forward to deepening our partnership with Airbus,” said Mr Kevin Shum, Director-General, CAAS.

“The urban logistics challenge is complex and an ecosystem of parcel lockers and autonomous vehicles will be a key piece to solving this puzzle,” said SingPost Group Chief Information Officer, Alex Tan. “The trial service that is taking off later this year will be an important step forward for SingPost in our efforts to develop solutions for the future logistics needs of Singapore and other cities of the world.”

“Project Skyways aligns with NUS’ vision of serving as a living lab to pilot innovative technologies and solutions. The NUS community is very excited to be the first in Singapore to experience this novel concept of parcel delivery by drones – an endeavour that could redefine urban logistics,” said NU Senior Deputy President and Provost, Professor Ho Teck Hua. “Students from the NUS Faculty of Engineering also have the opportunity to gain valuable experience as interns with Airbus for this project. We look forward to working closely with Airbus, CAAS and SingPost to carry out the campus-wide trial.”

An experimental project aimed at developing a safe and economically viable aerial unmanned parcel delivery system for use in dense urban environments, Skyways is one of a number of innovative Urban Air Mobility projects currently being researched at Airbus. These also include the Racer high-speed helicopter demonstrator, as well as the Vahana and CityAirbus autonomous flying vehicle concepts.

Airbus ramping up H225 production to more than 100 over next 5 years - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 22 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLXJhbXBpbmctaDIyNS1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLTEwMC1uZXh0LTUteWVhcnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Despite a flatlining of orders from the oil-and-gas market for the H225 Super Puma, a swelling of bookings from other sectors has led to Airbus Helicopters ramping up its production line to enable the delivery of more than 100 aircraft over the next five years.

Last year saw just eight H215/H225s delivered, but was also one of the type’s strongest years in terms of bookings, with 54 aircraft ordered.

Airbus has not received any orders for the H225 from the oil-and-gas market since the April 2016 crash of a CHC-operated H225 near Turøy, Norway. The incident resulted in the worldwide grounding of the fleet while Airbus and regulatory authorities explored the cause of the incident and confirmed preventative measures — such as the development of a full flow magnetic plug that improves the detection of metal spalling.

Despite the type subsequently gaining approval for operation from aviation authorities around the world, only 22 are now flying in offshore oil-and-gas operations, largely in Asia. In February 2018, Omni Táxi Aéreo signed a contract with Total E&P that marked the return of the type to operation in Brazil.

“Without the oil-and-gas [market], we are surviving in the Super Puma [program],” said Michel Macia, head of the H225 program. “Why? Because it’s a very versatile aircraft, a very flexible aircraft. Yes, oil-and-gas [offshore transport] was a big mission for this aircraft, but [it] can also provide public services, law enforcement, search-and-rescue, or military [service]. . . . So it’s a very versatile aircraft, and [there is] still a big market [for it].”

Because of the market interest, Airbus is making adjustments to its H225 final assembly line in Marignane, France, that will allow it to raise the production rate from 2017’s eight aircraft, to 13 in 2018, and 30 per year thereafter.

“It’s a huge ramp-up,” said Macia. “[It’s] a huge challenge in terms of people, because we need to find the right people to do it, but it’s also a challenge in terms of supply chain.”

At the end of last year, there were 100 people working in the final assembly line — which can accommodate 14 aircraft. This had increased to 150 staff by February 2018, and will reach 400 by the start of 2019. The workers will come from other programs, and some will be externally subcontracted, said Macia.

Because of the domination of oil-and-gas orders in the past, the assembly line was previously adapted to produce aircraft for that operation. With the lack of oil-and-gas orders, the organization of the line has been changed to more of a “flow line,” said Macia.

Together with improved control and monitoring of the supply chain, and increased efficiency at the various production stations, Airbus hopes to decrease the time it takes an aircraft to reduce the global lead-time for the aircraft by 15 to 20 percent.

An image problem in the North Sea?

Régis Magnac, head of customer operations at Airbus Helicopters, said the general downturn in the oil-and-gas market had led to an overcapacity that would have affected H225 sales in that segment regardless of the impact of the Turøy crash — but admitted the aircraft suffers from an image problem in the key market of the North Sea.

“We recognize that there is a perception issue in the North Sea because of the history of the aircraft, because of what happened,” he said. Indeed, in a survey from the manufacturer last year, 60 percent of the 5,000 respondents in the offshore oil-and-gas sectors said they would be uncomfortable flying in the H225. But the survey also found that the majority of respondents didn’t know what the company had done to address any issues in the aircraft.

Because of this, the manufacturer has embarked on an “awareness campaign,” communicating the work it has done and modifications it has made to the type. “It takes time, we’re doing this in a stringent manner and not trying to push anything to the market,” said Magnac. “We’re just helping our customers that own the aircraft in their will to fly again . . . and in that process, we see some positive trends. The people that have witnessed the improvements [Airbus has made to the aircraft], the things that have been performed, all the tests, and that have had discussions with the engineers here [in Marignane] are very much more convinced coming back than they were arriving here.”

Looking ahead to the longer-term future for the H225 program, Macia said Airbus was “requestioning . . . our strategy” on the potential of enhancing the type with equipment or weight upgrades due to the postponement of the X6 program to develop a new heavy-lift helicopter. “We need to reconsider something [for the H225] without the X6,” he said, but declined to give further details.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9239436388015747}",neutral,0.9239436388015747,0

Helisim, a joint venture of Thales and Airbus Helicopters, will develop and operate the simulation center, which will include the first H145 and H175 Level D simulators in North America. These Reality H simulators, built by Thales, will allow pilot training for two of Airbus Helicopters’ newest, most high-tech civil helicopters now entering wide use in the Americas.

The initial investment in the new facility is estimated to be about $40 million. It will have the capacity to train several thousand pilots and maintenance personnel a year, providing both initial and recurrent training. The center will be designed for future expansion, with the installation of an H160 simulator planned when the new model is certified and production is underway. It will also incorporate the existing training facilities of Airbus Helicopters Inc., including its H125/AS350 full flight simulator and H135/H145 flight training device.

""With this expansion, we will be able to support our customer’s needs for world class helicopter training in one convenient location,"" said Christopher Emerson, president of Airbus Helicopters Inc. ""Expanding our capabilities with H145 and H175 Level D simulators will allow customers to optimize their training programs and benefit from the expertise that we can provide onsite at our headquarters in the U.S.""

Airbus reports additional $1.6B charge in A400M aircraft program - Defense News,"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS8yMDE4LzAyLzE1L2FpcmJ1cy1yZXBvcnRzLWFkZGl0aW9uYWwtMTZiLWNoYXJnZS1pbi1hNDAwbS1haXJjcmFmdC1wcm9ncmFtL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Airbus has reported a 2017 charge of €1.3 billion (U.S. $1.6 billion) on the A400M military airlifter and restated its expectation that further heavy financial damage was limited on the program.

That charge was based on a detailed review in the 2017 fourth quarter on changes of “schedule, capabilities and retrofit” on the A400M, Airbus said Thursday in a statement with 2017 financial results.

That provision brought total charges on the A400M to €8.5 billion. The charges reflect the cost of late delivery, while Airbus seeks to fit tactical capabilities on the turboprop plane.

“With a clear road map in place, Airbus’ remaining exposure going forward is expected to be more limited,” the company said, reiterating a statement made Feb. 7 on negotiations for a new schedule with OCCAR, the European defense agency, and the seven client nations.

“The charge was actually less than feared,” said Sash Tusa, an analyst with equity research firm Agency Partners, which had thought it could be as high as €2 billion. “If this now ring-fences the entire A400M issue, it’s very good news indeed.”

Parties have effectively agreed to a rescheduling of delivery; what remains to be settled is a timetable for fitting capabilities on the aircraft. “It is an unrealistic expectation to have 100 percent capability on Day One,” he said.

Airbus delivered 19 A400M units last year, up from 17 in 2016. That delivery rate reflected a slowdown in production, stemming from the repair of the propeller gearbox on the TP400-D6 turboprop engine.

RELATED

A reduced production rate is expected over the next two years, an Airbus spokesman said. The company had slowed assembly in Seville, southern Spain, to avoid a buildup of completed aircraft on the tarmac, waiting for delivery to the clients.

That slowed delivery allowed time to fit “matured” capabilities, as some clients preferred to wait for aircraft fitted with military equipment rather than take delivery on time and then send the plane back for retrofit.

There was also less prospect of a buildup of aircraft while Airbus sought export sales, which have been slower than expected.

Airbus also booked a charge of €117 million following settlement with German authorities on an inquiry into alleged corruption in the sale of the Eurofighter Typhoon to Austria. That charge included legal costs for investigations.

The total €1.3 billion charge included €1.1 billion booked in the fourth quarter.

""On A400M, we made progress on the industrial and capabilities front and agreed a re-baselining with government customers, which will significantly reduce the remaining program risks,"" Airbus CEO Tom Enders said. ""This is reflected in a substantial one-off charge.""



Airbus reported an 8 percent increase in adjusted 2017 operating profit of €4.6 billion on steady sales of €66.8 billion.

Airbus shares soared 10 percent on better-than-expected free cash flow of €3 billion, up from €1.4 billion.

A Feb. 7 declaration of intent on the A400M “represents an important step towards reaching a contractually binding agreement also mitigating the commercial exposure while satisfying customer needs with regard to capabilities and availability of the aircraft,” Airbus said.

The clients are Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9910945296287537}",neutral,0.9910945296287537,0

Building digital leadership and co-innovating with regional and international partners

Creating an empowered Airbus Customer Services hub in Asia-Pacific



While air traffic is doubling every 15 years in the world, the Asia-Pacific fleet is set to almost triple by 2036. For services, this translates into more than a third of the global maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) business coming from this region by 2036. This represents more than $660 billion – the sum total of the accumulated spending during the next two decades, and encompasses the following segments: components; line maintenance and airframe base maintenance and engine maintenance.

Airbus predicts that the MRO business alone in the Asia-Pacific region will grow by 4.5 percent annually (compared with 3.7 percent worldwide) until 2036. Anticipating this growth, Airbus has clearly accelerated its presence in the region since the last Singapore Airshow, seizing all opportunities via acquisitions, joint ventures and partnerships, with digitalisation and co-innovation as key drivers. Airbus also foresees a global Asia-Pacific demand to train 220,000 new pilots for aircraft (above 100 passengers), and more than 200,000 new technicians, representing around 40 percent of the pilots and technicians worldwide training market.

Recent Services trends/highlights:

The Kannad ELT-DT complies with ICAO’s Global Aeronautical Distress and Safety System (GADSS) recommendations. Air France Industries and KLM Engineering and Maintenance have signed up to develop supplemental type certificates for the system. The first is expected to be complete next year and will be a retrofit for the Airbus A320 family.

“We’re very pleased to be the first on the market able to integrate a GADSS-compliant autonomous distress tracker as we continue to enhance the safety and confidence of the people who travel with the world’s airlines,” said Sami Smaoui, vice president of aircraft modification at Air France Industries. “This STC will be extremely important in bringing this critical technology to a huge portion of the world’s commercial fleet in that the A320 family is one of the most popular models in operation.”

The Kannad ELT-DT uses proven satellite-based distress beacon technology, providing detailed aircraft position information autonomously when a distress situation is detected in flight. GADSS capability will be recommended for aircraft with a takeoff weight greater than 12,500 pounds and required for newly built aircraft weighing in at more than 59,500 pounds beginning on November 8, 2018.

Orolia developed the system as part of the European Commission’s H2020 Helios program, which provides funding to companies in an effort to improve search and rescue capabilities. Helios sprouted as a result of several accidents in which the location of the distressed airplane remained unknown for an extended period of time, including an Air France accident in 2009, in which the flight recorders were not located for two years, as well as the Malaysia Airlines flight that vanished on March 8, 2014, the wreckage of which has yet to be located.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9993332028388977}",positive,0.9993332028388977,1

Unmanned drones will begin flying between parcel stations on campus by the middle of the year. The drones will land on roofs of stations, where a robotic arm will retrieve a package and place it in an individual locker. Customers can then pick up their package at any hour from the lockers.

CNBC attended the initial flight demonstration at the National University of Singapore campus where the drone appeared quite large and carried a packaged shirt inside.

The drone can carry between 2 to 4 kilograms, under 9 pounds. The machine weighs approximately 25 kilograms, which is about 55 pounds.

A representative from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore said the eventual plan is to roll out the drone parcel delivery system across the city-state, so long as it's done in phases.

EFW secures launch contract for A321P2F conversion from Vallair - Airbus,"Wed, 07 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wMi1lZnctc2VjdXJlcy1sYXVuY2gtY29udHJhY3QtZm9yLWEzMjFwMmYtY29udmVyc2lvbi1mcm9tLXZhbGxhaXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Elbe Flugzeugwerke (EFW), the joint venture between ST Aerospace and Airbus, announced today that it has secured a launch contract from Vallair Solutions Sàrl (Vallair) for its A321 passenger-to-freighter (P2F) conversion solution. The Germany-based aerospace company will convert 10 A321-200 passenger aircraft to a 14-pallet cargo configuration for Vallair. The first aircraft will be inducted in the last quarter of 2018, scheduled for redelivery by end of 2019.

Gregoire Lebigot, President and CEO of Vallair, commented: “My personal history with the A321 goes way back to the start of my career with Air France when it first introduced this aircraft in its fleet. At Vallair, through years of trading and supporting the A320 Family, we have built a solid technical competence on this aircraft type. Today, we see a huge potential in the A321 P2F, not only as a replacement of the B757F, but as a key tool for the cargo industry to achieve the projected growth rate of the air freight market in general – in particular driven by express services and e-commerce. The A321 P2F will be the first aircraft to introduce a containerized lower deck to the market segment of narrow body freighters: a significant game changer for any hub and spoke operation.""

Christopher Buckley, Airbus Executive Vice President, Europe, Africa and Pacific said: “We are delighted to see the A320/A321 P2F project – the only A320 Family freighter conversion programme co-developed with Airbus – move up a gear with this important order from Vallair. This milestone affirms our view, coupled with the positive feedback from the market, that the A321P2F is the only viable successor to the 757 freighter over the coming years.”

Dr. Andreas Sperl, CEO of EFW said: “We are pleased to have Vallair as our launch customer for our A321P2F solution, which we believe will play a lead role in the narrow body freighter segment. Together with our parent company, ST Aerospace and its global network of maintenance facilities, we are confident we will achieve the high standards of service we have demonstrated over the years on all of our other conversion programs, and deliver to Vallair its A321P2F aircraft, on time and budget, to their full satisfaction.”

Mr. Lim Serh Ghee, President of ST Aerospace said: “As the e-commerce and express market continue to grow, our investments in new freighter conversion programs will allow us to seize the opportunities created by the uptick in freighter demand. While offering a strong proposition with its unique container position in the lower deck, the A321P2F will also complement our other freighter solutions such as the mid-sized A330P2F program, to provide customers with a range of options to select from in support of their diverse operational needs.”

The A321 & A320 P2F conversion programs, launched in 2015, are the result of a collaboration between ST Aerospace, Airbus and EFW. ST Aerospace is responsible for the engineering development phase, up to the Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) approval by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Airbus contributes to the program with Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) data and certification support, while EFW leads the overall program and marketing & sales.

The A321P2F conversion program is the first in its size category to offer containerized loading in both the main deck (up to 14 container positions) and lower deck (up to 10 container positions). With a generous payload-range capability that can carry up to 27.9 metric tons over 2,300 nautical miles, the A321P2F is the ideal narrow-body freighter aircraft for express domestic and regional operations.

Other P2F solutions that ST Aerospace and EFW have in their family of Airbus freighters include the A330 which has two variants – the A330-200P2F and the larger A330-300P2F. EFW redelivered the first A330-300 freighter in December 2017 following the successful completion of test flights in October and awarding of the Supplemental Type Certificate by the European Aviation Safety Agency in November.

Currently leading the Japanese civil and parapublic helicopter market with more than 50% market share, Airbus Helicopters plans to increase its position in tandem with the Japan’s projected fleet growth of 2% annually over the next 20 years.

The first contract was signed with longstanding customer Excel Air Services, for a Helionix-equipped H135 helicopter. This new aircraft will join the operator’s growing Airbus fleet currently comprising an AS355N, AS350B2, AS350B3 and Hermès-designed H135. This best-seller light-twin helicopter will be dedicated for electronic news gathering missions.

The second contract was signed with a new customer the Hokkaido Government, which placed an order for one AS365N3+ helicopter from the Dauphin family. The helicopter will be dedicated for rescue missions and supporting activities in the Prefecture and will play an important role in the North of Japan, known for its extensive fields and harsh winter conditions.

Additionally, Airbus has delivered one AS365N3+ helicopter each to the Fukuoka City Fire Department and the Kumamoto prefecture respectively, for firefighting work, search and rescue missions and emergency support.

“The successive orders and deliveries signal a good start to the new year in Japan, as we renew long-lasting relationships and welcome new ones,” said Olivier Tillier, Managing Director of Airbus Helicopters in Japan. “With more orders expected in the coming months, we are all geared to provide total support through our well established value chain to serve the growing needs of our customers.”

Qatar Airways takes delivery of Airbus' biggest A350 yet - USA TODAY,"Tue, 20 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmF2ZWwvZmxpZ2h0cy90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTgvMDIvMjAvYWlyYnVzLTM1MC0xMDAwLzM1NDg5NjAwMi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qatar Airways takes delivery of Airbus' biggest A350 yet

TOULOUSE, France -- Airbus delivered its first A350-1000 passenger jet to Qatar Airways on Tuesday at the jetmaker's headquarters here. The ""dash 1000"" variant of the A350 is now the largest twin-engine jet Airbus has ever produced.



The jet was initially to be delivered late last year, but complications installing the airline's new Qsuite business class seats forced the target date to slip into the new year. The new seats have already been installed in some of Qatar's other aircraft, but it took than expected to adapt the new-design to the newer A350-1000s.



“It is very difficult to install a new program in a new airplane, especially the first one,” Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker said at a press conference prior to the delivery.

Qatar will fly the aircraft's first commercial flight Saturday (Feb. 24) between Doha and London Heathrow. The carrier will eventually work the jet into longer routes between Doha and the East Coast of the United States, according to Al Baker.

Airbus says the airplane can fly up to 7,950 nautical miles non-stop, making it capable of connecting Boston and Shanghai, or Paris and Santiago, Chile.



The -1000 is the second variant of the A350 family to be delivered to an airline. It joins its older-but-smaller sibling -- the -900 -- the first of which was first delivered to Qatar Airways in late 2014. The jets are manufactured with lightweight carbon-fiber composite materials instead of the more traditional aluminum. This change allows for greater fuel efficiency and more flier-friendly features, such as larger windows and lower cabin humidity.

A number of other carriers have since taken deliveries of Airbus' A350, including Delta, Cathay Pacific, Finnair, LATAM, Singapore Airlines and Vietnam Airlines, among others.

As for the -1000 variant, it's now Airbus' largest twin-engine jet to ever enter service. At 242 feet long, the jet can haul up to 440 passengers in an all-economy configuration or 366 in a more-typical three class layout.



However, sales of the -1000 variant have been sluggish with airlines showing increasing wariness about purchasing — and then having to fill — larger airplanes. Boeing's 777 program has fallen victim to the same fate, with its new 777X receiving record-busting orders after launch only to slow to a few dozen tepid commitments in the years since.

IN PICTURES: Behind the scenes: Airbus' A350 final assembly line (story continues below)

In the case of Airbus, a handful of airlines -- including Cathay Pacific and United Airlines -- have opted to swap previous orders for -1000 in favor of the smaller -900.



As a result Airbus says it is not presently pursuing plans for a third, even bigger version of the A350. The company had been toying with the idea for some time as a more direct competitor to Boeing's 777X, but has backed off the plan in the absence of a stronger business case for moving ahead.



Despite the sluggish sales and unfavorable trends, Airbus has not given up hope for the A350-1000.



“I believe [sales] will open up,” outgoing Airbus COO Fabrice Bregier said here.

TODAY IN THE SKY: First look: Delta shows off new 'flagship' Airbus A350 in Atlanta (story continues below)

Airbus' newest aircraft -- the A350 XWB -- passed through Milwaukee's General Mitchell International Airport on July 19, 2015. Airbus was showing this A350-900 as part of a A350 demonstration tour of the USA.



“The big wave of replacement of Boeing's 777-300ER, which we target with the -1000, will start around 2020-23,” he said, adding that now was the time for the company's sales team to kick into high gear.



“It is time to be much more aggressive, to explain to Boeing's customers that this aircraft will be the better choice than the 777-9X,” he said.



That will leave Airbus on something of a barnstorming sales tour across the Middle East and Asia-Pacific, a move that it hopes will drum up more orders for the -1000. The company is betting on huge growth from Asia-Pacific in particular, forecasting a need for some 4,000 new widebody jets in the coming decade.

Separately, the event was the last for Bregier, who ended his lengthy career at Airbus on Tuesday after being passed over to replace outgoing CEO Tom Enders.



Unrelated, Al Baker also made a curious remark that he was interested in becoming a launch customer in supersonic passenger jet travel. Al Baker said the primary hangup was in the engine technology.

Stay tuned ...

"Airbus reveals, clams up on A350 “Cabin Get Well” programme - Runway Girl Network","Wed, 21 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTgvMDIvYWlyYnVzLXJldmVhbHMtY2xhbXMtdXAtb24tYTM1MC1jYWJpbi1nZXQtd2VsbC1wcm9ncmFtbWUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TOULOUSE — Highlighting the continued existence of cabin supply problems with the Airbus A350 XWB family of aircraft during the delivery of the stretched -1000 version of the aircraft yesterday, Airbus disclosed the existence of a detailed supplier management programme called “Cabin Get Well”, but then declined to discuss any details in response to followups from Runway Girl Network.

During a media briefing in advance of the delivery of launch customer Qatar Airways’ first A350-1000 — delayed from December owing to problems with the manufacturing and integration of the Rockwell Collins-manufactured Qsuite — Airbus’ head of A350 marketing Marisa Lucas-Ugena revealed the Cabin Get Well programme was working with multiple suppliers to Airbus’ latest widebody.

“The [A350] programme has launched at the beginning of the year a programme that was called Cabin Get Well,” Lucas-Ugena said. “They are working very, very closely in particular with suppliers to make sure that all the parts arrive in Toulouse with the right quality, and we are working with our airline customers to solve all these issues.”

One such issue has been the delay for Qatar Airways in putting the launch A350-1000 into service. “This issue of Qsuite installation on the A350 is an issue that [was] raised with Rockwell Collins and us,” Qatar Airways group chief executive Akbar al Baker confirmed to RGN later in the media briefing.

Continued al Baker, “This is a very complex programme. It is very difficult to install any new programme in a new airplane, especially being the first one. The requirement was extremely complex and it was done in record time, though we took the delay as Qatar Airways — the aircraft was already delivered to us on time, as committed by Airbus to us. Unfortunately the installation and calibration on the first airplane of a very complex seat programme will always take time. However, I must tell you that we have achieved this ten days ahead of schedule that was provisionally given to us.”

While RGN recently highlighted quality and reliability issues with the Boeing 777-300ER version of the Qsuite, similar problems — to a greater or lesser extent — have been experienced by other manufacturers.

Airbus’ problems with supplier quality and production on the A350 cabin have been well documented across seats, lavatories and other cabin elements, particularly notably for Qatar Airways, with al Baker previously not holding back his criticism of the airframer for integration failures and quality gaps. The mercurial chief executive’s latest position on the XWB is markedly more rosy, with a suggestion that Qatar Airways may convert some of its smaller A350-900 aircraft to the larger -1000 model.

A350 marketing chief Lucas-Ugena, who characterised her role as “my job is to talk about the good things — I normally don’t talk about programs” in response to RGN’s questions, followed her comments about the Cabin Get Well programme with a more positive spin on the XWB. “The airplane family, the -900 and the -1000, is extremely mature. Of course, when you put a new airplane in service there are always some things that you need to fine tune. The cabin is one of them. Fortunately, the airplane is so mature that we can really focus on those things that otherwise we couldn’t have focused so quickly on in such an efficient way. The few things that were not at the level that we wanted to them to be, we are catching up with them very quickly.”

During a one-on-one interview with Airbus executives, RGN asked senior vice president for marketing François Caudron for further details of the Cabin Get Well programme.

Caudron declined to discuss it, summarising only the earlier issues at the time of the 2014 delivery and early 2015 entry into service of the -900. “We had, it was known – and passengers – regretfully the issues with lavs on the first A350-900 that we did put into service. Therefore, Airbus did launch a joint programme together with Zodiac to improve the product. From what I’m hearing now, things are getting much better.”

RGN asked Caudron whether that work was also taking place with other suppliers, as A350 marketing head Marisa Lucas-Ugena had said earlier. “I cannot comment on that,” Caudron said. “I’m not really following on all the in-service — I think that was essentially what we heard from the entry into service.”

Caudron declined to discuss Cabin Get Well further, telling RGN that “you would need to interview someone from the programme to talk about that. I cannot comment on that.”

During this set of one-on-ones, Lucas-Ugena said from her perspective in charge of A350 marketing only that “everything is working extremely well on the aircraft. The airplane is good, it’s mature, the production ramp-up is working extremely well. We have introduced the -1000, we have certified the -1000 — it’s on target or exceeding targets, so that makes us able to concentrate on the development of both and the little details that we need to keep improving to make it even greater than we have today. The news is: no big worries, so we can concentrate on things like the cabin getting well.”

Clearly, there would appear to be an inconsistency between a named programme that Lucas-Ugena said was “working very, very closely in particular with suppliers” in the plural and this later, rosier picture.

Despite repeated requests, Airbus media representatives declined to make any A350 programme executives available to discuss the matter further.

BLR FastFin system for Airbus H125 gains market momentum - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 26 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYmxyLWZhc3RmaW4tc3lzdGVtLWFpcmJ1cy1oMTI1LWdhaW5zLW1hcmtldC1tb21lbnR1bS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters has commenced factory installations of the optional BLR Aerospace FastFin system for the H125, giving operators the opportunity to benefit from the FastFin system from the day their aircraft is delivered.

BLR announced at HAI Heli-Expo 2018 that the first factory installation of an H125 FastFin system has now been completed, for an aircraft that will be delivered in June to Heli-Austria. The operator is a long-time supporter of BLR FastFin systems, employing them on its Bell medium helicopters as well as its H125s.

“The H125 systems we are already flying with are operating very well,” Heli-Austria president Roy Knaus stated in a press release. Knaus said that while the FastFin system is beneficial in all flight regimes, the company considers it “essential for high-altitude operations,” with Heli-Austria aircraft routinely working at altitudes between 7,000 and 10,000 feet, and sometimes up to 13,000 feet.

BLR became famous in the helicopter industry with its FastFin systems for Bell medium helicopters, which have proven to be so popular and effective that they now come standard on the Bell 412EPI. Like the Bell medium solution, the H125 FastFin system directs airflow more efficiently to improve aircraft performance, although the systems differ in their details.

The H125 FastFin system uses an “Advanced Tailboom Aerodynamic Cowling” to change the shape of the left side of the tail boom, increasing lateral force on that side. A line of vortex generators further increases lateral force on the left side of the tailboom, while a small strake reduces lateral force on the right side.

According to BLR, the system increases useful load by up to 120 pounds (55 kilograms) in hot and high conditions, while also delivering a 10 percent improvement in pedal margins. As Vertical discovered during a 2016 test flight, the enhanced handling qualities associated with the FastFin system also make the H125 significantly smoother to land and hover.

Since the H125 system was first certified by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in December 2016, BLR has sold more than 30 kits for aircraft operating in seven countries. While Bell mediums still account for the vast majority of the more than 1,100 FastFin systems flying worldwide, BLR president Mike Carpenter is optimistic that the H125 system will find similar success as the market gains exposure to it.

“That’s what happened with the Bell 412,” he told Vertical before Heli-Expo, explaining that after the first firefighting operator won contracts with FastFin-equipped Bell mediums, “it just spread after that — everyone jumped on.”

Whereas adoption of the FastFin system for Bell medium helicopters was primarily driven by operators seeking improved performance, Carpenter said that H125 customers are also expressing interest in the improved handling qualities.

“Relative to the 412 FastFin system, the [H125] FastFin system has a more pronounced stability and handling qualities improvement,” he said. “So I think that while our Bell 412 FastFin system is sold generally to people who need to lift more stuff, with the system for the H125, there will be a bigger percentage of the market that buys it because it makes such a significant difference in the way the aircraft handles.”

In addition to the system now being installed at the factory, 25 Airbus Helicopters Customer Centers worldwide have also been authorized to sell and install the FastFin system. Carpenter said that BLR is now working with those centers to train them on the installation process, and expects them to become “a big part of our sales funnel going forward.”

Carpenter emphasized that Airbus has been an outstanding partner in bringing the H125 FastFin system to market. “They’ve really been great to work with,” he said.

In a press release, Axel Aloccio, head of the H125/H130 program at Airbus, stated, “We are excited to work with BLR to offer our H125 customers worldwide the FastFin system for both factory installation and retrofit. The FastFin system enhances the H125 performance in hot and high conditions and further reinforces the superiority of the H125 in the single-engine helicopter market.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999631643295288}",positive,0.9999631643295288,1
Honeywell Launches a New APU Engine Rental Bank Service for Airbus A330 and A340 Aircraft - aviator.aero,"Thu, 01 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20uYXZpYXRvci5hZXJvL2hvbmV5d2VsbC1sYXVuY2hlcy1hLW5ldy1hcHUtZW5naW5lLXJlbnRhbC1iYW5rLXNlcnZpY2UtZm9yLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzMwLWFuZC1hMzQwLWFpcmNyYWZ0L9IBfGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20uYXZpYXRvci5hZXJvL2hvbmV5d2VsbC1sYXVuY2hlcy1hLW5ldy1hcHUtZW5naW5lLXJlbnRhbC1iYW5rLXNlcnZpY2UtZm9yLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzMwLWFuZC1hMzQwLWFpcmNyYWZ0L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ROLLE, Switzerland, Feb. 1, 2018 – Honeywell (NYSE: HON) has joined forces with rental dealership Logix Aero to provide an auxiliary power unit Engine Rental Bank that loans Honeywell’s 331-350C auxiliary power units to operators with Airbus A330 and A340 aircraft.

“There is an increasing need for local services to help operators maintain their aircraft, and customers are looking toward rental dealerships to provide short-term and long-term APU rental solutions,” said Jean-Christian Morin, president, Logix Aero. “We’re working with Honeywell to provide airlines with rentals for Airbus A330 and A340 aircraft when they need them and without having contractual obligations toward the repair of their core units.”

The agreement permits operators to rent, rather than purchase, an auxiliary power unit (APU) with the added benefit of allowing them to use the maintenance service of their choice for existing equipment. This removes the need to prepare separate contracts with Honeywell for APU purchase, upkeep and repair, helping to save on costs and reduce downtime.

Working with Logix Aero will see Honeywell deliver its 331-350 APUs to operators without a direct repair contract for the first time. Customers can choose to rent over a period that addresses their business and operational needs, whether on a short-term basis to cover maintenance time on existing equipment, or over a longer term. APUs are flown by the operators during the loan period and returned to Logix Aero when it ends.

“Unscheduled engine and APU maintenance can lead to aircraft downtime and flight cancellations. Renting an APU through Honeywell’s Engine Rental Bank, implemented by Logix Aero, will cost significantly less than ordering a new one to cover repairs to existing equipment,” said Randy Anderson, president, Europe, Middle East, Africa and India Aftermarket, Honeywell Aerospace. “This agreement allows airlines to plan aircraft upkeep ahead of time, while providing an alternative solution to ensure customers can continue operations locally without worrying about unplanned costs.”

Honeywell is the world’s largest manufacturer of APUs, which are found on many leading aircraft, including regional, executive, commercial and military platforms. APUs are primarily used to power an airplane during ground operations, providing electricity, air conditioning, main engine starting and more. They also provide backup electrical power during flights.

"Airbus readies A350-1000 for delivery, dismisses Boeing 777-9 - Leeham News and Analysis","Tue, 20 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxOC8wMi8yMC9haXJidXMtcmVhZGllcy1hMzUwLTEwMDAtZGVsaXZlcnktZGlzbWlzc2VkLWJvZWluZy03NzctOS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Feb. 20, 2018, © Leeham Co.: Toulouse: Airbus will deliver its first A350-1000 to launch customer Qatar Airways within hours, making the end to a nearly two-month wait for the ceremonial handover.

The aircraft was legally delivered to Qatar in the closing days of 2017, but issues with the QSuite interior held up the hand-over until today. The airplane will enter revenue service between Doha and London Heathrow Airport.

Earlier today, Marisa Lucas, Head of A350 XWB Marketing, extolled the virtue of the A350-1000 and, in a response to a question, dismissed the coming Boeing 777-9 as a threat to the -1000. She also waved off the prospect, for now, of stretching the -1000 into a “2000” that would directly challenge the -9.

Not worried about 777-9

Today is supposed to be about the delivery of the A350-1000, but a reporter asked Lucas whether Airbus is concerned about the 777-9, which is planned to enter service in 2020.

Lucas dismissed the 777-9 as a “compromise” airplane, using old and new features. The new ones—the wing, engines and fuselage stretch—add weight to the airplane, she said.

A fully loaded A350-1000 weighs as much as an empty 777-9, she said. The -1000 is 15% more economic than the 777-9, she says. (Boeing claims the 777-9 is more efficient than the -1000.)

Although the 777-9 nominally carries 40 more passengers than the -1000, Lucas said going to 10-abreast in the -1000 will even the seat count, though at the expense of comfort.

Dismissive of an A350-1000 stretch

Lucas also dismissed the prospect of stretching the A350-1000 into an “1100” 0r “2000” that would have the same capacity of the 777-9.

Airbus studied the prospect, she said, but there are no plans to do so.

Final Assembly Line

Media was given a tour of the A350 Final Assembly Line as well.

Airbus is ramping the production rate up to 10/mo by the end of this year. LNC understands that Airbus will go to 13/mo next year.

Airbus has a different assembly philosophy than Boeing for its wide-body airplanes.

Boeing has an in-line production system for its 777 and 787, with moving elements on each. Airbus assembles the A350s side-by-side, a process of long-standing.

Airbus prefers the side-by-side in part to avoiding stopping the entire line in the event there is a significant problem on one plane in the lines. If one occurs in the side-by-side production, Airbus can, if needed, back the airplane out of the position and work on it elsewhere, replacing the plane with another.

The Airbus method also enables “stuffing” the fuselage with large components that otherwise might have to be inserted disassembled through passenger doors, only to be reassembled once inside the airplane.

Airbus' growing A350 XWB Family makes its mark - Airbus,"Tue, 06 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE4LTAyLWFpcmJ1cy1ncm93aW5nLWEzNTAteHdiLWZhbWlseS1tYWtlcy1pdHMtbWFya9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The A350-1000 will build on the highly-successful commercial service experience with its A350-900 sibling

Just over three years since entering commercial service, Airbus’ A350 XWB is flying high – with its A350-900 baseline version becoming an increasingly-common sight at airports around the globe, and the extended-fuselage A350-1000 variant positioned for a smooth start in its own operational career.

At the beginning of 2018, a total of 142 A350-900s had been delivered to a constantly growing customer base that already includes 17 airlines: Air Caraïbes, Air Mauritius, Asiana Airlines, Cathay Pacific, China Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Ethiopian Airlines, Finnair, French Blue, Hong Kong Airlines, LATAM, Lufthansa, Malaysia Airlines, Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways International (THAI) and Vietnam Airlines.

The twin-engine A350-900 has demonstrated an exceptional entry-to-service, evidenced by the fleet-wide dispatch reliability rate above 99.2% – which exceeds the level of reliability targeted by Airbus for this point in time. The jetliner also is delivering on its promises to reduce take-off and cabin noise and cut fuel burn by 25% compared to previous-generation widebody airliners.

Quiet on the outside, comfortable inside

In-service measurements show that the A350-900 has the quietest cabin of any twin-engine jetliner, while the aircraft also has demonstrated the dramatic fuel burn reduction announced, as well as great maturity. In addition, customer feedback indicates that passengers appreciate the innovative Airspace by Airbus cabin design and features – which provides the best in comfort, well-being and technology.

In a typical three-class cabin configuration, the A350-900 version in service today seats 325 passengers while the A350-1000, the largest member of the A350 XWB family, will accommodate 366 passengers. Both aircraft offer the same true long-range capability of 8,000 nm.

Thanks to an exceptionally-high level of airframe and systems commonality, the A350-900’s successful service entry portends a similarly strong start for the A350-1000.

A high-profile A350-1000 stopover before entry-in-service

The primary difference between the A350-900 and A350-1000 versions are the engines: the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-84 powerplant has played an important role in the -900’s fuel savings and dispatch reliability, as well as lower noise levels; and the Trent XWB-97 – also produced by Rolls-Royce – will offer the same for Airbus’ A350-1000.

With the A350-1000 certified in November 2017 by European and U.S. airworthiness authorities, Airbus is readying to deliver the world’s first aircraft to launch operator Qatar Airways shortly. Currently, an A350-1000 cabin-fitted flight test aircraft is undergoing a three-week demonstration tour and visiting customers in 12 destinations in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions – including a starring role at this week’s Singapore Airshow.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999996423721313}",positive,0.9999996423721313,1
Airbus Soars With Maiden Flight of the Longest-Range Single-Aisle Jet Ever - Popular Mechanics,"Thu, 01 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHVsYXJtZWNoYW5pY3MuY29tL2ZsaWdodC9haXJsaW5lcy9hMTU5NTQ2NDQvYWlyYnVzLW1haWRlbi1mbGlnaHQtbG9uZ2VzdC1yYW5nZS1zaW5nbGUtYWlzbGUtamV0LWEzMjFsci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus conducted the first flight of the A321LR (long range) on Wednesday, January 31. The jet is the newest in Airbus's A320neo (new engine option) family, and has the longest range of any single-aisle commercial aircraft at 4,000 nautical miles. For comparison, the A321LR's main competitor, the Boeing 737 MAX 7, can fly 3,850 nm.

Fuel efficiency and range on smaller, single-aisle aircraft keep getting better, which is one big reason airlines are moving away from the the large jumbo jets they used to rely on for long transoceanic flights. The big Boeing 747 has already flown its last route for a U.S. airline, and the enormous Airbus A380 is being phased out as well.

Single-aisle jets with enough range to cross the oceans are the future, and the A321LR is Airbus's latest jet to make that future a reality. Boeing is also working on a new long-range, single-aisle jet, one that could fly over 5,000 nm, officially known as the New Midsize Airplane (NMA)—though it is believed the jet will become the Boeing 797.



""Thanks to its outstanding performance and unbeatable efficiency, the A321LR will allow our customers to perform flights of up to 4,000nm, allowing them to open new routes—for example transatlantic—and conquer new markets,"" said Klaus Roewe, head of the A320 Program at Airbus, in a press release.

The jet's efficiency can be attributed in large part to its engines, which are CFM International LEAP-1As. CFM International is a joint venture of GE Aviation and French aerospace company Safran Aircraft Engines. The high-bypass LEAP turbofans use composite fan blades manufactured through resin transfer molding. These flexible blades untwist as the primary fan runs at higher rotational speeds, maximizing the fuel efficiency of the engines.

The Airbus 321LR's maiden flight clocked in at two hours, 36 minutes. It carried two test pilots, three flight test engineers, and an aircraft cabin specialist. The pilots took the aircraft through a series of flight control, engine, and main systems tests at low and high speeds while the crew monitored aircraft conditions.

The A321LR also has Airbus's widest single-aisle fuselage and a new door configuration, allowing the plane to carry 240 passengers. The European aerospace giant increased the maximum takeoff weight of the A321LR by 97 metric tons, allowing the aircraft to carry a third additional center fuel tank and achieve its range of 4,000 nm.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9210662245750427}",neutral,0.9210662245750427,0

Then the next steps I would say would be the technical milestones, such as electrification, to reduce the costs.” Airbus anticipates that fully certified VTOLs should be flying by 2023, according to Rotorhub.

The aircraft will be driven by four 140-kw lithium-ion batteries to power the eight Siemens SP200D electric motors, which directly drive the eight fixed-pitch propellers, according to a report in VerticalMag based on Bebesel’s news conference. “The only real mechanical part on this aircraft is the propeller shaft,” said Bebesel. “Of course, this simplicity has a big impact on operational cost, and this simplicity has an impact on maintenance costs.” Airbus is targeting a range of about 60 miles and a speed of about 75 mph for the aircraft, according to Bebesel. Those parameters will enable the VTOL to operate efficiently in “all the megacities of the world,” he said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9775329232215881}",neutral,0.9775329232215881,0
CityAirbus eVTOL urban air mobility program presses ahead - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvY2l0eWFpcmJ1cy1ldnRvbC11cmJhbi1haXItbW9iaWxpdHktcHJvZ3JhbS1wcmVzc2VzLWFoZWFkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters has revealed new details of its CityAirbus electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) program, with a first flight of its demonstrator aircraft still firmly in its sights for the end of this year.

Airbus hopes the aircraft is a vision of the future of “urban air mobility,” and its striking multirotor design and stylized aerodynamic appearance certainly make it look like something taken from the set of a science fiction movie.

But the manufacturer believes it’s the most practical attempt yet to develop a viable product for the next evolution of aviation transportation.

The aircraft’s propulsion is provided by four pairs of propellers: the lower propellers sit towards the bottom of four large ducts on the fuselage’s corners, while the counter-rotating upper rotors sit exposed slightly above the ducts.

“This kind of multicopter architecture allows you to completely redesign the aircraft from scratch,” said Marius Bebesel, head of urban air mobility at Airbus Helicopters, during a recent presentation for aviation media at the company’s facility in Donauwörth, Germany — where the project will be based until it has completed its first flight.

Despite representing something of a technological leap forward, simplicity is at the core of the aircraft’s design. Four 140-kw lithium-ion batteries power the eight Siemens SP200D electric motors, which directly drive the eight fixed-pitch propellers. Instead of pitch control, the aircraft will adjust the revolutions per minute (RPM) of the propellers to move the aircraft forwards.

“The only real mechanical part on this aircraft is the propeller shaft,” said Bebesel. “Of course, this simplicity has a big impact on operational cost, and this simplicity has an impact on maintenance costs.”

The aircraft is also relatively compact at just eight meters wide by eight meters long — a necessary consideration given its ultimate goal to operate in built-up urban environments.

“We want to keep this vehicle very efficient and compact at the same time,” said Bebesel, highlighting the “three-dimensional ducts” as one of the key elements of CityAirbus’s design. “This three-dimensional duct is making this concept really viable, because the ducted propeller allows you to increase the lift capability, while keeping the vehicle very compact.”

This is important to reduce drag during cruise flight, he said, during which the ducts function as “a bit of wing.”

And it’s because of this that the aircraft will be able to meet one of the team’s key performance targets — being able to achieve cruise speed in forward flight without having to pitch its nose down to any large degree. Bebesel claimed it will even be able to fly at a more neutral attitude than a traditional helicopter.

Performance characteristics

At the start of the development process, Airbus performed a market study to establish popular requirements for an urban air transport vehicle — and it is these targets for size, speed and range that CityAirbus is being developed to meet.

“The [market study] has proven that you don’t need to fly too fast for this mission, so for us it’s 120 km/h [75 miles per hour],” said Bebesel. “But, as we’re improving the vehicle, I think we we’ll go beyond [that speed].”

The team is aiming for a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of 2.2 tonnes (4,850 pounds) for the demonstrator; the airframe represents just 10 to 15 percent of that total, but the four batteries alone weigh about 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds). Bebesel emphasized that the team is constantly improving the aircraft’s weight and that there is plenty of room for optimization due to an oversized motor for the demonstrator, but still, the aircraft will clearly have plenty of room to carry the weight of the final fittings of a production model, as well as the four passengers it is designed to carry.

CityAirbus is currently targeting a range of about 60 miles (96 kilometers), which Bebesel said “will be enough to cover all the megacities of the world.”

The cabin will be accessed through a door in the fuselage underneath the rear of the fore ducts. The clearance to the bottom of the ducts from the ground is just 1.95 meters (6 feet and four inches), so the propellers will need to be completely stopped before passengers embark or disembark. However, this is unlikely to be too much of an issue with the aircraft’s ability to bring the propellers to a complete stop in “a few seconds” if required, said Bebesel.

The inside of the cabin will feel spacious “like in a British taxi” he said. Behind the cabin, the batteries will hang on a rail in the rear of the aircraft’s fuselage, allowing them to be moved fore or aft to adjust the aircraft’s center of gravity according to its payload.

The batteries present one of the main challenges facing the program team. “We need to get the batteries at a point that they have enough energy on board, they are lightweight, you can allow a big recharge, and then lifetime will be an issue as well,” said Bebesel.

For the first few years of the aircraft’s life as a production model, it’s likely to need to have its batteries replaced once or twice per year, and those batteries would likely require a recharge time of 30 to 60 minutes between flights. But as battery technology improves, Airbus hopes to lengthen their lifetime and reduce charging time to around 15 minutes.

Airbus is using a mix of metal and composite for the demonstrator’s airframe, with metal providing the team greater flexibility to quickly and cheaply adjust the design as it changes during the development.

Any production model would also use a mix of materials, said Bebesel, with composite used “where it is really needed” for its stiffness and weight.

The design is being kept as simple as possible to allow for high volume production if the project proves a success.

Single failure tolerance is built into CityAirbus’s design, with Airbus claiming the aircraft will be capable of losing one propeller, motor, or battery, and still be able to safely land. Bebesel said the team has “a concept” for how the aircraft will cope with a potential bird strike.

“It’s not a cage, but we will work with the design of the duct in front to prevent a direct bird impact,” he said.

Demonstrator development

The program reached a major milestone last December with the completion and powering-on of the “iron bird” ground test facility, which has the capability to operate CityAirbus’s propulsion system chain from flight controls to the dynamic loads of the propellers.

Once the electric, mechanical and thermal dynamics of the aircraft’s propulsion system have been matured and verified on the test bench, it will be embedded on the demonstrator.

The first flight — scheduled for December 2018 — will be piloted, albeit remotely, through the use of a joystick in a ground control system. However, as Airbus is designing and developing the aircraft to be self-piloting, the flight tests will plan to use manual control as little as possible.

“We will start automatically, we will land automatically, [and] we will fly around a given route and waypoints,” said Bebesel.

The eventual certification of the aircraft will be another challenge, largely because it will again be breaking new ground. Bebesel said his team has “a concept of how to certify” CityAirbus, but that the certification of the batteries and the aircraft’s complex electrical architecture would present the largest challenge.

While using CityAirbus as a personal air vehicle “could be an option,” Bebesel said the ultimate plan for the type is as a mass form of transit between established hubs within cities — similar to existing car-share programs — which could be ordered through the use of an app on a phone.

It’s here that the program is most ambitious — given that it requires large-scale infrastructure development and buy-in from cities and the general public.

“The number of hubs we need are equivalent to the number of metro stations/underground stations [in a city],” said Bebesel. For cities such as London, New York, and Paris, this would equate to over 200 hubs.

Such a proliferation would mean fleets of aircraft in the skies — and the prospect of the noise this would bring. Because of this, Airbus knows it is crucial to keep CityAirbus as quiet as possible.

Airbus is aiming for around 70 A-weighted decibels — less than the noise of cars on a highway at a distance of 100 meters, and much quieter than a helicopter.

“It’s just the beginning, so we are experimenting a lot,” said Bebesel. “There are a lot of [options] in terms of noise, you can really design to get the acoustic [element] very silent.”

The speed of the propellers is one such element. Compared to a helicopter’s rotor tip speed of 210 meters per second, the propellers in CityAirbus have a rotor tip speed of around 120 meters per second.

An important project

Around 50 engineers are working on the CityAirbus project, and while Airbus hasn’t revealed the exact level of investment it has made in the program, it’s clearly a significant amount — showing just how important it is for the company’s future.

“We really think this will be a very important, a very interesting segment of the vertical lift industry,” said Dr. Wolfgang Schoder, CEO of Airbus Helicopters Deutschland. “CityAirbus is exactly the center of our competence, the center of our market.”

The program is one of several initiatives Airbus is undertaking to stake a claim of the future urban air mobility market. It also has the Skyways project in Singapore for autonomous drone parcel delivery, and its A^3 Silicon Valley outpost is developing the self-piloted Vahana eVTOL aircraft, as well as the Altiscope project to shape future regulations and air traffic control requirements to safely integrate eVTOL aircraft into urban skies.

Finally, Voom — the on-demand helicopter booking platform that launched in São Paulo, Brazil, in April 2017 — recently joined Airbus Helicopters after having been incubated at A^3.

“[Voom] is showing pretty clearly there is a need for urban air transportation in cities,” said Bebesel. “Even with a conventional helicopter — which is a bit more noisy and higher in costs than a CityAirbus will be — even with this concept and the right approach you can deliver an opportunity for cities.”

Airbus: Back to square one – DW – 02/14/2018 - DW (English),"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3LmNvbS9lbi91bmNlcnRhaW4tdGltZXMtdGFrZS1haXJidXMtYmFjay10by10aGUtZHJhd2luZy1ib2FyZC9hLTQyNTY0ODI20gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The European aircraft manufacturer has never faced as much upheaval as it does today. At Airbus' headquarters in Toulouse, there is much uncertainty, but many also see opportunities. DW's Andreas Spaeth reports.

It was a surprise not to see Airbus' legendary sales boss John Leahy sitting on the podium at the company's Singapore Air Show press briefing last week: In his place was his successor Eric Schulz.

After more than 30 years at Airbus, where Leahy played a key role in turning the European aircraft-making consortium from a newcomer into the global market leader, the 67-year-old New Yorker has sold his villa in Toulouse and is moving back home.

His French successor, who is 10 years younger, comes from the engine manufacturer Rolls Royce and has yet to show that he can fill the huge footsteps left by Leahy.

This week, another Airbus heavyweight will make his last major appearance. Fabrice Bregier (56), the head of the firm’s commercial aircraft division, will present the Airbus’ financial results for 2017 on Thursday in Toulouse, before leaving the aircraft manufacturer later in the month.

Unlike John Leahy, whose doctors have urged to adapt a healthier lifestyle after persistent heart problems, Bregier is leaving because he failed in his bid to succeed the German CEO Tom Enders (59), who in turn will wrap up more than a decade at the helm in April 2019.

Turbulent times for new management

The current turbulence being felt in Toulouse is probably the biggest upheaval in Airbus' 48-year history.

Both Enders and Brégier find themselves in the spotlight of investigators following massive allegations of corruption against Airbus' military and civilian operations, although so far no personal misconduct has been proven.

In November, a raid took place at Airbus' Paris offices in connection with a probe into a satellite business with Kazakhstan in 2010. Enders by then had already prepared his staff to expect ""hard and turbulent times."". ""We need fresh faces for the 2020s,"" he told them.

Bregiers will be replaced by the former head of Airbus’ helicopter division, Guillaume Faury (49). That will ensure the delicate balance of German and French control at the top of Airbus will be maintained. But whether Ender's successor will be German remains uncertain.

Enders had always endeavored to change the small-minded national mindset at Airbus, but achieved only moderate success. He moved the corporate headquarters from Munich to Toulouse and put its Paris office up for sale, ignoring the disquiet in political circles. But he has not been able to completely stop many of the national resentments that still fester within the group.

Insiders hope that Enders, in his remaining year in charge and with more autonomy than ever, will be able to force through further integration measures, and set the company on a firm footing for the future.

Airbus and Boeing's eternal duel

The corruption charges, internal squabbles, and now the changes at the top of Airbus, have diverted attention internally. As a result, some staff are unsettled.

Some industry insiders fear that the aircraft maker has allowed its succession plans to detract from important issues, especially the troubles in its commercial aircraft division.

But the fact is, Airbus had a surprisingly successful year in 2017, largely due to major year-end sales. In December 2017 alone, Airbus took 776 firm orders following the Dubai Air Show, more than in 2016 as a whole.

Overall, Airbus ended 2017 with 1,109 orders, far ahead of Boeing with 912, maintaining an advance that Airbus has kept for years and years.

Airbus has, however, traditionally often lagged Boeing in terms of aircraft delivered, as it did again in 2017. The Europeans delivered a total of 718 jets from their factories in Toulouse; Hamburg; Mobile, Alabama; and Tianjin, China, compared to the 763 aircraft that left Boeing's.

A380: saved for the time being

Before leaving, outgoing sales chief Leahy had not only posted the biggest order of all time at the Dubai Air Show — 430 aircraft at a total list price of nearly $50 billion (€45 billion) for the US investment firm Indigo and four affiliated airlines. But in January the firm revealed a significant deal for the ailing A380, the world's largest passenger plane.

After Emirates Airline refused to sign a contract to buy more A380s, Leahy threatened the double-decker plane’s biggest customer publicly by announcing that the entire A380 program would have to be discontinued without an Emirates order.

Just a few days later, Emirates signed a letter of intent to buy 36 of the giant planes (20 directly with the option to buy another 16). The deal was finalized in Abu Dhabi earlier this week.

The deal has saved the A380 program for now, which means production is likely to continue for at least the next ten years.

Even so, the A380 urgently needs more customers to ensure long-term sustainable rates of production. This year, only 12 will be produced, and in 2019 only eight.

But before that, on February 20, Qatar Airways — Emirates' biggest competitor in the Persian Gulf — will be welcomed to Toulouse. The Qataris are the launch client for the stretched version of the Airbus A350, the A350-1000.

With just under 370 passengers in two classes, the longer A350 can carry around 40 more passengers than the original model, and is designed to compete with the new versions of the Boeing 777.

However, orders for the A350-1000 are at a standstill. Customers have repeatedly migrated to the smaller base model and the -1000's order book shrank from 211 to 169 units.

That leaves sales boss Eric Schulz with a huge mountain to climb to show that he can handle the role with as much virtuosity as his legendary predecessor Leahy.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9942591190338135}",neutral,0.9942591190338135,0

news by Alasdair Whyte 14 February 2018 Print this page

Digital helicopter-booking platform Voom has joined Airbus Helicopters as an exclusive on-demand service.

Voom was first launched in April 2017 as part of the Airbus’s A^3 programme – its Silicon Valley project that invests in visionary aerospace entrepreneurs – providing helicopter commuter flights for passengers in São Paulo, Brazil’s largest and endemically bottle-necked city..

Voom will provide the manufacturer with an established platform to support its growth in the urban mobility market and is planning to expand outside of the region later this year.

“We are thrilled to join Airbus Helicopters to build the urban air mobility experience around the world,” said Uma Subramanian, CEO of Voom. “Our services provide convenient, reliable and affordable air transit to urban areas that so desperately need an alternative to traditional ground transportation. Following our launch in Brazil, we are expanding into additional cities, beginning with Mexico City early this year.”

E-Vtol innovation

As well as pursuing on-demand urban transport services, Airbus is also developing an aircraft to fly on these short-range urban flights.

Airbus’s self-piloted Vahana eVTOL aircraft Vahana looks to be a cost-effective replacement for cars and trains in cities. The aircraft is fully automated to minimise human error and can carry up to four passengers. Vahana completed its first flight earlier this month

“Urban transportation on and below ground is reaching its limits and, naturally, Airbus is looking to the skies to redefine a third axis for public transportation solutions,” said Matthieu Louvot, Airbus Helicopters executive vice-president customer support and services. “Voom will allow us to grow the usage of existing helicopters for the benefit of urban citizens and operators. With Voom we will also explore and develop new business models in order to support our innovation roadmap.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9448527693748474}",positive,0.9448527693748474,1
Airbus picks Safran's Aneto engine for Racer compound demonstrator - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 27 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLXBpY2tzLXNhZnJhbnMtYW5ldG8tZW5naW5lLXJhY2VyLWNvbXBvdW5kLWRlbW9uc3RyYXRvci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Safran Helicopter Engines, which had initially planned on supplying a pair of RTM322 engines for the Airbus Helicopters Racer compound demonstrator, has seen its more modern Aneto selected by the airframer. The move goes along with an increase in the target cruise speed, at 215 knots. Moreover, the 2,500-shaft-horsepower turboshafts will benefit from an innovative architecture, allowing one engine to be throttled back to idle in cruise to save fuel.

The Racer, which benefits from the experience gained during the earlier X3 program, is slated to fly in 2020. It features a main rotor, a box wing, and two side-mounted pusher propellers. Such a design makes it easier to fly at high speeds. The main rotor has to provide less lift, thus needing less power. Its rotating speed becomes aerodynamically easier to handle.

The Aneto, already selected for use in the Leonardo AW189K, is exceptionally compact, Safran emphasizes. The manufacturer claims it delivers 25 percent more power than existing engines of the same volume. The engine “will play a key role in supporting the wider Racer demonstrator project, which brings together technologies from a wide network of more than 25 industrial, academic and research partners from across the European Union in order to make a significant and durable contribution to the competitiveness of the European aerospace industry”, said Tomasz Krysinski, Airbus Helicopters vice-president for research and innovation.

The specification for cruise speed, which was standing at 220 knots on the X3, was downgraded to 190 knots on the RTM 322-powered Racer, and is now referred to as “400 kilometer per hour” (215 knots).

Developed by Safran Electrical & Power, the Aneto’s Power Pack Eco Mode configuration will allow the crew to “pause” an engine in cruise. In that phase of flight, it is more fuel-efficient to use one engine at high power than two engines at medium power. The fuel saving is estimated a 15 percent for a given mission. In just 10 seconds, the idling engine can rapidly and automatically be restored to full power using a specially-designed electric motor. This feature can be used in case the engine running at full power fails.

Safran has conducted extensive ground testing and the system will fly for the first time on the Racer.

For the engine manufacturer, this will be a first step towards a hybrid engine architecture. The second step is planned to be “transient assistance,” in which an electric motor complements the turboshaft when high power is needed. It allows engineers to size the engine for cruise flight, as opposed to takeoff. The engine’s fuel consumption is thus optimized for the longest phase of flight. Ground testing is underway.

The third step will be a multi-rotor system. Electric motors will drive the rotors but a turboshaft will supply electric power via a generator. Such a system, rated at 100 kW (135 shaft-horsepower), is planned to be tested this year. Safran is working with an unnamed designer of futuristic vertical takeoff and landing vehicles.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9931111335754395}",positive,0.9931111335754395,1
Digitising maintenance for end-to-end continuity - Airbus,"Fri, 09 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE4LTAyLWRpZ2l0aXNpbmctbWFpbnRlbmFuY2UtZm9yLWVuZC10by1lbmQtY29udGludWl0edIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"How do you digitise and automate maintenance activities? Airbus’ Singapore-based head of technology in APAC Cyrille Schwob is determined to show the industry how.

Cyrille, how did ‘Hangar of the Future’ get off the ground?

The Hangar of the Future project came into existence in February 2016 as a response to the challenges faced by the MRO providers in Singapore due to an ever-increasing level of maintenance activities required by growing fleets in Asia.

With the mass application of digital manufacturing technologies to production assembly lines we were seeing as part of the Industry 4.0 revolution, it became clear to us that that achieving true end-to-end digital continuity for the entire life cycle of an aircraft meant extending digital technologies and principles to maintenance activities.

My role is to oversee the project’s continuous development, making sure we integrate next-generation technologies and develop state-of-the-art business applications. I am a big believer in the Hangar of the Future initiative, and I am far from being alone on this one: the concept has attracted several interested players over the last two years with whom we have discussed and analysed the potentially huge savings it could provide.

What is Hangar of the Future in a nutshell?

The premise is simple: Hangar of the Future combines various technologies that together speed up maintenance and improve efficiency to be able to cope with more work in less time.

Airlines are already moving more and more towards predictive maintenance and automated inspections to reduce the burden of inventory costs and lead times. This initiative demonstrates how leveraging new digital technologies can transform the MRO industry, which appeals to both MRO centres as well as the technicians who work in them. Maintenance technicians are one of the most in-demand vocations nowadays given the constantly growing number of in-service aircraft, and they welcome solutions that make their job more efficient and enjoyable.

How did you decide which technologies to include?

We started off by analysing real-life use cases provided by our partners in the MRO sector. After an in-depth analysis, we selected technologies that will speed up every step of the maintenance process.

This includes smart, IOT-connected equipment such as collaborative robots, drones, scanners, cameras, non-destructive sensors, couple with Airbus’ open data platform, Skywise.

Skywise collects essential in-service data from the various IT and aircraft systems and offers powerful tools and a framework for conducting analyses. As an example, we are currently using it to correlate various maintenance events to identify patterns that allow us to further optimise distinct maintenance operations.

Why Singapore?

It was really a no-brainer to set up the Hangar of the Future in Singapore, a region where Airbus has fast-growing services presence, important maintenance operations and several key partners, such as ST Aerospace and SIAEC.

Singapore’s innovation ecosystem is an extremely welcoming environment for R&T demos, not to mention the country boasts world renowned universities, such as the Temasek Polytechnic education institution, high-quality research organisations such as ASTAR, and a vibrant start-up scene that enabled us to work with Unabiz.

All of this has been facilitated by a strong partnership with the country’s Economic Development Board (EDB), co-founder of the project.

Vahana air taxi gets 16 feet off the ground during first flight in Oregon - GeekWire,"Fri, 02 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlZWt3aXJlLmNvbS8yMDE4L3N1Y2Nlc3MtYWlyYnVzLWFpci10YXhpLXZhaGFuYS1nZXRzLTE2LWZlZXQtb2ZmLWdyb3VuZC1maXJzdC1mbGlnaHQtb3JlZ29uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This week marked a milestone for Airbus Ventures’ Vahana team, which is developing a self-flying, electric-powered air taxi — also known as a flying car.

Vahana’s 20-foot-wide Alpha One prototype executed its first test flight at the Pendleton Unmanned Aerial Systems Range in eastern Oregon, rising to a height of 16 feet (5 meters) during 53 seconds in the air on Wednesday morning. Another test flight came a day later, Vahana project leader Zach Lovering reported in a Medium posting.

Representatives from the Federal Aviation Administration and Airbus’ A3 advanced-projects division were in attendance, along with the full Vahana team, Lovering said.

“In just under two years, Vahana took a concept sketch on a napkin and built a full-scale, self-piloted aircraft that has successfully completed its first flight,” he said in a news release.

Lovering said there’ll be further milestones ahead:

“Following the completion of this successful test, the Vahana team will continue development and perform further flight tests to transition and forward flight. We also have identified a new partner for our motors, MAGicALL. The California-based company designs and manufactures custom, cutting-edge components (motors, generators, inductors, transformers, etc.) with impressive performance on rapid and affordable delivery schedules. We will begin using the MAGicALL motors soon, and will provide additional technical details and insight.”

Vahana’s all-electric air taxi is designed for vertical takeoff and landing, with a battery range of 100 kilometers (62 miles). Once it enters service, passengers would use smartphone apps to book rides, a la Uber.

Uber is among the other top players in a competition to field electric-powered air taxis. During last month’s CES electronics show, one of Uber’s aviation partners, Bell Helicopter, showed off a passenger cabin mockup for the vehicle it’s developing. Uber is aiming to demonstrate air taxi services in Dallas-Fort Worth, Los Angeles and Dubai in 2020, and start commercial flights by 2023.

“There will be people flying around Dallas, Texas,” Uber CEO Dana Khosrowshahi said last week during a tech conference in Germany. “I think it’s going to happen within the next ten years.”

Aurora Flight Sciences, which recently became a Boeing subsidiary, is also participating in Uber’s air-taxi initiative.

Other flying car ventures include Joby Aviation, which just reported a $100 million investment round, Terrafugia, VerdeGo Aero, Kitty Hawk, China’s EHang, Switzerland’s Passenger Drone, Germany’s Volocopter and Lilium, Slovakia’s AeroMobil and Japan’s Cartivator Project.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9921321272850037}",neutral,0.9921321272850037,0
