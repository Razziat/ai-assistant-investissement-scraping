It has secured a large fine against a substantial multi-natio­­nal organisation. It has also demonstrated the impact of successful cross-border co-operation. However, the question of individual accountability remains live.

Introduction

On 31 January 2020 the SFO announced that it had entered into a DPA with Airbus. Under the terms of the DPA, Airbus has agreed to pay a fine and costs amounting to €991 million in the UK, and in total €3.6 billion as part of a larger global resolution for bribery, involving agreements with authorities in France (the Parquet National Financier (""PNF"")) and the United States (the Department of Justice (""DoJ"") and Department of State (""DoS"")). This is the seventh DPA the SFO has negotiated and is the largest (in terms of financial penalty) to date. The DPA was the result of a long-term investigation alongside the PNF as part of a joint investigation team (""JIT"") which worked in parallel with the US investigation and US authorities. The scale of the investigation was very significant – 30.5 million documents (excluding duplicates) were collected from over 200 custodians, the SFO‘s costs were £6.9 million and Airbus engaged five international law firms to handle the investigation, defence work and related remediation.

The misconduct

Airbus' alleged misconduct which the SFO investigated and was the subject of the DPA, took place between 2011 and 2015 across five jurisdictions (Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan and Ghana) and concerned Airbus' Commercial and Defence & Space divisions.1

The scale of the alleged misconduct was large and varied, and included2:

Paying US$50 million in sponsorship to a sports team jointly owned by executives of a major airline that went on to purchase large amounts of aeroplane stock from Airbus.

Making numerous corrupt payments directly to airline executives, employees and/or their relatives.

Making numerous corrupt payments to relatives of government officials.

Engaging intermediaries known as ""Business Partners"" (""BPs"") in several jurisdictions, who were paid (often undue) commission for sales Airbus made in their region. BPs were managed by an Airbus subsidiary with an annual budget of $300 million. The JIT reviewed more than 1,750 entities and identified around 110 BPs as having ""red flags"" for corruption.

Alerting authorities

No disclosure of misconduct was made by Airbus until UK Export Finance (""UKEF"") declared its position (see below). On the contrary, in 2012, at the height of the alleged misconduct, Airbus commissioned a private company to review its compliance programme and was awarded with an ""Anti-Corruption compliance certificate"" for the design of its anti-bribery compliance program.3 Certainly, as Dame Victoria Sharpe (President of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court) pointed out in her judgment, Airbus had an elaborate compliance programme including detailed written policies governing payments and contractual relationships with third parties which belied the reality of Airbus‘ conduct (see more below). The programme extended beyond policies and was put into action soon after Airbus’ conduct came to light – for example from 1 June 2015 the Legal & Compliance functions at Airbus were merged and re-structured; being given far greater prominence and authority under a newly-appointed General Counsel, who became a member of the governing Group Executive Committee (which also comprised of a new Board of Directors).4

As part of its business, in 2015 Airbus obtained export credit financing from UKEF, a Government body. The UKEF initially raised concerns regarding the suspicious practice of BPs, and the lack of information that had been provided to it in relation to one BP in Sri Lanka. In April 2015 UKEF wrote to Airbus, informing it of its duty to report all suspicious circumstances to the SFO. In response to this, Airbus conducted a review of the accuracy and completeness of its declarations to the UKEF relating to the use of BPs in applications for export credit financing. This review culminated in a detailed report made to the UKEF in 2016, following which the UKEF felt it appropriate to contact the SFO and expressed a strong preference that Airbus do the same. Both Airbus and the UKEF reported to the SFO at the same time on 1 April 2016.5

The interests of justice

As with all DPAs, in performing its duties the Court had to conclude that the SFO's agreement with Airbus was in the interests of justice and fair, reasonable and proportionate. The Court spent some time deliberating the first part of this test in its judgment approving the DPA.

In this case Dame Victoria Sharpe was satisfied that the DPA met the required test - in spite of the following factors:

the extent of the alleged misconduct;

the fact that the Court acknowledged that seriousness was a key factor in rendering a DPA outside the interest of justice; and

that the Court stated that the ""seriousness of the criminality in this case hardly need[ed] to be spelled out"".6

The key factors that contributed to the Court's ultimate decision in this regard was the level of Airbus’ self-reporting, co-operation and remediation efforts including significant changes to its internal systems and senior management team, which were described as ""exemplary"" (see below).7

Co-operation and compliance

Though Airbus’ co-operation was described by the Court as initially ""slow [to] start"" Airbus received credit for reporting conduct which had taken place “almost exclusively overseas”8. Airbus was then commended for the extent to which it co-operated with the authorities including accepting the extraterritoriality of section 2 notices.

The Court also made much of the changes that Airbus carried out on its internal systems and compliance, on this topic it stated:

""Airbus has (i) created numerous new compliance roles and extensively recruited highly experienced senior compliance professionals; (ii) revised its Anti-Bribery and Corruption policies and procedures in response to recommendations by external stakeholders, the Independent Compliance Review Panel (ICRP), PwC and Agence Française Anticorruption (AFA), the French state anti-corruption agency which is positioned within the Ministry of Justice and headed by a Magistrate; (iii) launched a company-wide, systemic and comprehensive ABC Risk Assessment; (iv) significantly reduced the use of external consultants across the Airbus group of companies, and has stopped the use of consultants in relation to sales of aircraft within the Commercial Aircraft Division; (v) redesigned the 'onboarding', due diligence and ongoing monitoring for all third parties with a business relationship with the Airbus group; (v) implemented a targeted ABC 24 month training plan under the supervision of the Ethics and Compliance Engagement Team for all employees identified in high and medium risk"".9

On this topic, the Court further stated:

“Airbus has made significant changes to its internal processes… Airbus has commissioned an ICRP to complete an independent review of Airbus’ ethics and compliance procedures. The ICRP’s instructions have included reviewing Airbus’ policies and procedures, conducting site visits with employees and carrying out focus groups with employees. The ICRP has produced two reports to date. The first report in 2018 noted the considerable progress made by Airbus and made fifty five recommendations. The second report, in 2019, noted that “the company is now in a very different place than it was two years ago”. The ICRP is due to issue another report later this year. Further, the Airbus Ethics and Compliance teams have been restructured to ensure functional independence from the business. Amongst other things, there has been a merger of legal and compliance functions and the change of the reporting line to the newly appointed General Counsel; the creation of a subcommittee of the Board, entitled the Ethics & Compliance Committee to provide independent oversight of the company’s Ethics & Compliance programme; and appointed a new Ethics & Compliance Officer with changed reporting lines directly to the General Counsel and the Ethics & Compliance Committee.

Co-operation between authorities”10

The SFO's collaboration with the PNF, DoJ and DoS was fundamental in achieving the enormous fines attributable to the DPA and related settlements. In this case, the SFO formed a joint investigation team with the PNF which worked in parallel with the US investigation. Each of the prosecuting authorities took responsibility for a number of geographical areas or customers and have entered into separate DPAs. SFO Director Lisa Osofksy also praised of the collaboration between authorities stating: ""A resolution of this scope would not have been possible without the commitment, determination and hard work of SFO staff and our French and American colleagues"". 11

Conviction of individuals

However, the DPA represents the completion of only the first stage of the investigation into the offences. A large part of the misconduct involved systematic bribe-paying, primarily through the use of BPs. Such misconduct can include multiple levels of involvement: those paying the bribes, those involved in any cover-up, professionals who failed to respond to red flags, senior managers who either actively encouraged the practice or deliberately turned a blind eye, and executive directors and board members who permitted the culture to allow misconduct to happen. Clearly, there may be several culpable individuals operating at different tiers of Airbus that may face prosecution.

In the recent past the SFO has notably been unsuccessful in prosecuting individuals for their role in an organisation's misconduct (e.g. the SFO investigation into Guralp resulted in the prosecution of three employees, all of whom were acquitted; the investigation into individual involvement in the Rolls Royce misconduct was dropped and most recently the SFO failed in its high profile prosecution of Barclays executives). It remains to be seen whether any current or former employees of Airbus will face charges in the UK arising from the offences which were the subject of the DPA, but a failure to properly investigate individuals will undoubtedly increase the scrutiny faced by the SFO. 12

Conclusion

The Airbus DPA is noteworthy for the record breaking fine and its international co-operation with French and US authorities which eventually led to the DPA. It also demonstrates that, even where there is significant and pervasive misconduct, a DPA can still be deemed in the interest of justice, provided an exceptional level of co-operation is established by the organisation at fault. Elsewhere, the DPA provides an understanding of the weight the court gives to co-operation over other factors when deciding on awarding a DPA (e.g. self-reporting, the level of misconduct etc.) and provides some clarification over the level of ongoing co-operation that is required by organisations subject to a DPA. Looking beyond the DPA, the SFO have demonstrated that it is capable of co-operating with other international authorities in order to achieve a common purpose. This serves as a reminder to the international community that no organisation is too large to avoid scrutiny. However, past failures mean this DPA will place increased pressure on the SFO to investigate and successfully prosecute culpable individuals."
Our decarbonisation journey continues: looking beyond E-Fan X - Airbus,"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTA0LW91ci1kZWNhcmJvbmlzYXRpb24tam91cm5leS1jb250aW51ZXMtbG9va2luZy1iZXlvbmQtZS1mYW4teNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aviation connects and unites people. As people discovered the magic of flight, serving this fundamental need drove a steep growth in air travel. This increase led us to explore innovative technologies to ensure that future generations can enjoy flying as much as we do.

When I first started my career at Airbus, the notion of electric flight was considered a far-off pipedream. Today, it’s a reality. Airbus’ overriding goal remains unchanged: we’re fully committed to decarbonising aviation. We’re steadfast in our belief that there’s no world in which the future of air travel is not a sustainable one.

As we start to navigate the realities of a post-COVID-19 world, I’m more certain than ever that we need to continue full-speed ahead with our sustainability ambitions. In fact, given the unprecedented challenge of climate change, we at Airbus have been asking ourselves if we could take an even bolder approach to reduce CO2 emissions. Today, our answer is a resounding yes!

But decarbonising the aviation industry is no small feat. To achieve this, we need to re-focus all of our efforts on technology bricks that will take us there. It’s for this reason that Airbus and Rolls Royce have jointly decided to bring the E-Fan X demonstrator to an end. As with all ground-breaking R&T projects, it’s our duty to constantly evaluate and reprioritise them to ensure alignment with our ambitions. These decisions are not always easy. But they’re undoubtedly necessary to stay the course.

When we launched the E-Fan X project in 2017, we set out with the ambition to push the limits by testing disruptive technologies in a game-changing approach to future aircraft. And we did just that: E-Fan X has shattered pre-conceived notions of what is possible in future flight. This helped us to pave the way for an industry-wide decarbonisation movement of which we’re proud to take the lead.

To say we’ve learned a lot from this demonstrator project would be an understatement. Over the past three years, each successful E-Fan X milestone has offered us rich insights for the future, including:

Serial hybrid-electric propulsion: Hybrid architectures, high-voltage systems and batteries are indispensable technology bricks for several other demonstrator projects across our wider R&T portfolio to diversify power sources. We will continue to develop and mature them at our E-Aircraft System Test House.

New pathways for disruptive CO2 reduction: Exploring the possibilities—and limitations of—serial hybrid-electric propulsion also opened up inquiry into new technology pathways. Hydrogen being one of them, which is equal parts a huge opportunity as it is a new challenge.

Future certification and regulatory acceptance: From the start, we have been consistently delighted by our customers’—and indeed, the entire aviation ecosystem’s—overwhelming enthusiasm for E-Fan X. With our research partnerships on hybrid-electric and hydrogen airport infrastructure and operations, we will have laid a foundation for the future industry-wide adoption and regulatory acceptance of alternative-propulsion commercial aircraft.

Thanks to these key learnings, Airbus has developed a more focused roadmap on how to progress on our ambitious decarbonisation commitments. A lofty achievement for a first-of-its-kind demonstrator like

E-Fan X.

As we head into the future, I would like to sincerely thank all partners, engineers and designers—at Airbus and beyond—who have tirelessly brought their expertise, passion and engagement into driving this pioneering project. I’m extremely grateful and proud of the team: you’re an amazing group of bold, talented and dedicated professionals! Also, I’d like to thank Paul Stein, Rolls-Royce CTO, and his team for an extraordinary partnership on E-Fan X. I invite you to read Paul’s moving statement here. It’s through cross-industry partnerships like these that the aviation industry will bring competitive zero-emission solutions to the future of flight.

Although E-Fan X will not take to the skies, I strongly believe that its spirit will live on as we continue on our journey towards climate-neutral flight.

It’s a journey that we’re all on together. And only together, we will succeed.

Airbus and Boeing hustle to keep airplanes flowing to a collapsed market - The Air Current,"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYWlyY3VycmVudC5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnktc3RyYXRlZ3kvYWlyYnVzLWFuZC1ib2VpbmctaHVzdGxlLXRvLWtlZXAtYWlycGxhbmVzLWZsb3dpbmctdG8tYS1jb2xsYXBzZWQtbWFya2V0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Log-in here if you’re already a subscriber

Release Date April 21, 2020 Airbus and Boeing hustle to keep airplanes flowing to a collapsed market Purchase a PDF of this article

“This is not a great time to sell airplanes, let’s not kid ourselves,” said U.S. President Donald Trump summing up the state of the industry earlier this month.

It’s an understatement, of course. Passenger demand is near zero, well over half of the world’s fleet is parked and credit markets — by all accounts — are effectively frozen. No less than 55% of the $570 billion in industry revenues are slated to evaporate this year. Airlines are selling planes to lessors for immediate cash with the intent of parking them. On top of it all, oil futures have reached a point that producers will pay you to take their oil.

The commercial aviation market has collapsed.

Amid this COVID-19 chaos, it is apparent both Boeing and Airbus are trying every trick in the book to keep airplanes moving and their industrial ecosystems alive. More than a dozen interviews by The Air Current with senior leaders at airlines, plane makers, lessors and suppliers around the world reveal a host of short and longer-term efforts at moving airplanes to buyers. All this at a time for most airlines and lessors, taking delivery of a new airplane looks more like a burden than a blessing.

“The vast majority of their revenues have been put down to zero and most of them are fighting for their survival and fighting for short term ways of securing their balance sheet, their cash positions and being able to navigate through their next weeks and months,” Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said of the company’s customers in a recent call with the media.

In slashing its production plans by a third on April 8, Faury said, “What we are doing in terms of rate reflects the blending of the very diverse situations around the world.” The conversations have been “very granular” in trying to understand the financial positions of its customers and how many airplanes the company should be building. Airbus was left with 60 unclaimed aircraft at the end of the first quarter, some of which it is now trying to re-sell. The surge in deferrals has forced Airbus to scale back A350 output from 10 to 6 per month, A330s from three to two and A320 production from 60 down to 40.

For both Boeing and Airbus, near term strategies are geared around an “exchange of short term deliveries against long term relief,” said Henri Courpron, chairman of Plane View Partners consultancy. The goals, he told TAC, are aimed at clearing the inventory of aircraft in the production system, which is holding onto billions of dollars in working capital."

by J. Kasper Oestergaard, European Correspondent, Forecast International.

Boeing and Airbus delivered 20 and 36 commercial jets in March 2020, compared to 54 and 74 deliveries, respectively, in the same month last year. With just 50 deliveries this year to date, Boeing is 99 shipments behind last year’s total for the first quarter. Airbus delivered a total of 122 jets from January to March, compared to 162 during the same period last year. Boeing’s deliveries have suffered for many months in the aftermath of two 737 MAX crashes and the subsequent suspension of deliveries and grounding of the fleet. Deliveries of 737 MAX aircraft have been put on hold since March 2019. Due to COVID-19, both manufacturers have been forced to temporarily close down production facilities. For the full year 2019, Boeing delivered 380 aircraft, while Airbus set a new all-time annual record, handing over 863 jets. Prior to this, Boeing had retained a deliveries lead over Airbus since 2012. In 2018, Boeing delivered 806 jets (763 in 2017), with Airbus handing over 800 (718 in 2017).

In March, Boeing delivered one 737NG, five 767s, three 777s and 11 787s. Boeing’s shipments will likely take a substantial hit in April due to the ongoing suspension of production at the company’s locations in Washington and South Carolina. On March 23, Boeing announced that all production at its facilities in Washington would be shut down for 14 days commencing March 25. On April 5, Boeing announced that the suspension had been extended until further notice. In addition, on April 6, Boeing announced it will temporarily suspend all 787 operations in South Carolina until further notice, starting April 8. On April 13, Boeing reopened some of its production operations, including the build line for the 767-based KC-46 tanker at its Everett facility. Work has also resumed on the P-8A Poseidon in Renton and the 737 MAX at Moses Lake. On April 16, Boeing announced it will restart commercial airplane production in a phased approach at its Washington facilities starting Monday, April 20. Employees on the 737, 747, 767 and 777 programs will return on April 20, with most returning to work by April 21. Employees on the 787 program will return on April 23, with most returning to work by April 24.

Production of the 737 MAX has been suspended since January. Prior to this, Boeing had been producing 737 MAX jets at a reduced rate of 42 aircraft per month. Boeing expects the aircraft to resume service in mid-2020, and the latest plans are calling for a restart of 737 MAX production by May. However, in these uncertain times, plans are frequently postponed, and the 737 MAX’s return to the fleet has been delayed several times in the past. In the meantime, test flights and software changes continue. In any case, it will be a few years before Boeing is able to hit the planned monthly production rate of 57 aircraft. Prior to the suspension of deliveries in March 2019, Boeing had delivered 387 737 MAX jets.

In March, Airbus delivered two A220s, 30 A320s (1 CEO / 29 NEO), one A330, and three A350s. Prior to COVID-19, Airbus was targeting a 5 percent rate increase to 63 jets per month from 2021 and was also discussing a further ramp-up with its supply chain that could have brought the production rate up to as high as 67 aircraft per month, or 804 per year, by 2023, putting the company within reach of a total of 1,000 jet deliveries per year. Those plans have now been shelved. For the full year 2019, Airbus handed over 642 A320 family aircraft, of which 551 were A320neos. This compares to a total of 386 A320neo family aircraft deliveries in 2018, up from 181 and 68 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Airbus delivered a record 112 A350s in 2019, up from 93 and 78 in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Airbus increased the monthly A350 production rate to 10 during 2019.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Airbus will cut production on several programs for the remainder of the year. The A320 production rate has been reduced to 40 aircraft per month, down from an average of over 53 aircraft per month in 2019. The A330 and A350 programs are reduced to a rate of two and six aircraft per month, respectively. No rate cut has been announced for the A220 or A380, but Airbus has delayed a planned A220 production ramp-up at its Mirabel facility near Montreal, where the company has been producing four A220s per month. Production at the facility is currently suspended until early May. Airbus has also suspended production at its U.S. facility in Mobile, Alabama, where it produces A220 and A320 narrowbody jets. Commercial production and assembly activities in Bremen, Germany, are paused until April 27. Airbus in Stade near Hamburg was closed down from April 5-11 but has since reopened. Production and assembly work in France has resumed gradually since March 23, although commercial aircraft wing production in the U.K. and commercial production activities in Spain have been temporarily suspended. Airbus has also received multiple requests from customers to defer deliveries, and the company is seeking solutions case by case and aircraft by aircraft.

Turning to the orders race, Boeing reported 31 gross orders in March and 150 cancellations, for a total of -119 net new orders. Orders included 11 787-10s and one 787-9 for Japan’s All Nippon Airways (ANA), the 787 launch customer. Also, FedEx ordered a single 767 freighter. Also, on March 30, Boeing was awarded a $1.5 billion contract by the U.S. Navy for the next 18 P-8A Poseidon maritime warfare aircraft. The P-8A is a heavily modified 737-800. The contract includes eight aircraft for the U.S. Navy, six aircraft for the Republic of Korea Navy, and four aircraft for the Royal New Zealand Air Force. Year-to-date, Boeing has accumulated 49 gross orders (196 cancellations => -147 net new orders). For the full year 2019, Boeing accumulated 243 gross orders (330 cancellations => -87 net new orders). For the full year 2018, Boeing booked 893 net new orders and 1,008 gross orders.

In March, Airbus booked 60 gross orders and reported 44 cancellations, for a net of 16. Irish leasing firm AerCap placed orders for 25 A320neos and 25 A321neos, while an undisclosed customer ordered 10 A350-900s. For 2020 to date, Airbus has accumulated 356 gross orders (66 cancellations => net of 290). For the full year 2019, Airbus landed 1,131 gross orders (363 cancellations => net of 768), thereby retaking the orders crown from Boeing. In 2018, Airbus booked a total of 747 net new orders and 831 gross orders, thereby losing the 2018 orders race. Prior to this, Airbus had retained an orders lead over its rival every year since 2012.

At the end of March, Airbus reported a backlog of 7,650 jets, of which 6,749, or 88 percent, were A220 and A320ceo/neo family narrowbodies. This is 75 aircraft below the company’s all-time backlog record of 7,725 aircraft set in January 2020. By the end of March 2020, Boeing’s backlog (total unfilled orders before ASC 606 adjustment) was 5,428 aircraft, of which 4,407, or 81 percent, were 737 NG/MAX narrowbody jets. Boeing’s all-time backlog high of 5,964 aircraft was set in August 2018. The number of Airbus aircraft to be built and delivered represents 8.9 years of shipments at the 2019 production level. In comparison, Boeing’s backlog would “only” last 6.7 years at the 2018 level, which we use as a proxy for 2019 due to the drop in 737 MAX deliveries. This year to date, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio, calculated as net new orders divided by deliveries, is negative due to cancellations exceeding gross orders. Airbus’ book-to-bill ratio is 2.38, mainly thanks to very strong order bookings in January. In 2019, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio was negative, while Airbus reported a book-to-bill of 0.89.

But the coronavirus pandemic has forced it to face a devastating fact: Some airlines that put in orders do not want its planes now.

The aerospace company said on Wednesday that 60 of its aircraft could not be delivered in the first quarter, partly because the airlines that ordered them want to put off paying for them.

With the majority of the world’s commercial aircraft sitting on runways and not earning money, airlines do not need new planes.

“We are now in the midst of the gravest crisis the aerospace industry has ever known, ” Guillaume Faury, the company’s chief executive, said in a statement on Wednesday."

French design firm Cabinet Alberto Pinto is one of the leaders in private aircraft interior design.

The firm's portfolio, under the direction of Linda Pinto, includes airliners turned private jets from Airbus and Boeing, which manufacturer some of the world's largest planes. Alberto Pinto was behind the interior design of a massive Boeing Business Jet 747-8i, a four-engine palace that's currently the largest private jet to roam the skies.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

One plane with which the design firm is intimately familiar is the Airbus ACJ319, the private jet variant of the Airbus A319 currently in service with scores of airlines ranging from British Airways to Spirit Airlines. Unlike the airline operators of the type, however, Alberto Pinto's clients are expecting the most lavish and luxurious interiors for their aircraft.

A recent addition to the Cabinet Alberto Pinto line-up is an ACJ319 purchased for private use by a Chinese businessman, according to Architectural Digest. After delivery, the plane was entrusted to the firm and Swiss aircraft interior builder AMAC Aerospace to create the masterpiece.

"On its 15th birthday, the Airbus A380 is facing retirement - CNET","Mon, 27 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvdGVjaC1pbmR1c3RyeS9vbi1pdHMtMTV0aC1iaXJ0aGRheS10aGUtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtaXMtZmFjaW5nLXJldGlyZW1lbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Big, burly and a bit bulbous, the Airbus A380 has never been the sleekest airliner in the skies. I'm not disputing that it's an engineering achievement, because it certainly is. The largest commercial aircraft ever to fly, it delivers a supremely smooth and quiet ride for passengers. On my first A380 flight, five years ago, it felt like we were hovering noiselessly as the British Airways giant descended over San Francisco Bay. It took the San Mateo Bridge flashing by my window to remind me that, yes, we were actually moving.

It's just that from the outside, the double-decker Airbus A380 looks like, well... a bus. Enormous? Yes, Powerful? Absolutely. Elegant? Not so much. One snarkier nickname for it is ""the flying forehead."" But even so, I respect what the superjumbo represents and I'll eagerly wish it a happy birthday. Fifteen years ago today, April 27, the A380 flew for the first time. Since then, it's been a hit with passengers, even if its commercial success hasn't been what Airbus originally hoped. There's nothing like it in the sky today, and as Airbus winds down production completely by 2021, hastened by the coronavirus pandemic, there never will be again.

From A3XX to A380

Airbus first conceived of the A380 as a way to compete with the Boeing 747, which dominated long-haul flights in the last quarter of the 20th century. First announced in 1994 as the A3XX, the new airplane would be larger than the Boeing 747-400 and cheaper to operate, Airbus promised. In 2000, the company chose the A380 designation, but problems with configuring the 310 miles of wiring in the fuselage and other developmental hurdles (building a new plane is never easy) delayed the first flight and the A380's passenger service. The company also had to develop a complicated process for getting the aircraft's parts from production centers across Europe to the final assembly plant in Toulouse, France. Finally, on Oct. 25, 2007, the ""21st Century Flagship"" entered service with Singapore Airlines. Depending on the configuration, it could carry about 555 people with a range of 8,000 nautical miles, or 9,200 miles (an all-economy class A380 could carry more than 800 people).

The A380's massive size made onboard lounges, like this one on an Emirates aircraft, possible. Kent German/CNET

It wasn't long before the A380 was a regular visitor to megahub international airports like Los Angeles, Hong Kong, Sydney and London Heathrow, all of which had to reconfigure terminals and taxiways to fit it. Though grand visions of onboard spas, gyms and shopping arcades never panned out -- airlines always realize they'll make the most money by adding more seats -- some did add lounges, showers and private first class suites with separate living areas and bedrooms. US airlines rejected the A380, but carriers in Asia, the Middle East, Australia and Europe placed orders. The A380's real savior was Emirates, which now has 118 A380s, with another eight aircraft on order. As Emirates mostly flies people to its Dubai base and then on to somewhere else, the A380 fits its business model well.

By its 10th birthday, though, the A380 was flying into turbulent skies. Airbus had gambled on a future like the reality that Emirates operates -- a ""hub and spoke"" model where airlines would need a big airliner to fly a lot of people to one city, and then put them on other big planes to somewhere else. But to many carriers, the A380 was far more aircraft than they needed. Also, the cost to buy (about $445 million apiece) and operate it was more than many could afford (Airbus announced a more fuel-efficient model at the 2017 Paris Air Show). Those airlines opted instead for smaller, two-engined aircraft like the Boeing 787 and 777 and Airbus' own A350, which could fly fewer passengers nonstop between cities and for less money (called a ""point-point"" model). Airbus initially projected 1,200 A380 deliveries over two decades, but as of March 30, it's delivered only 242 aircraft, with nine orders still left to fill.

The A380 is most impressive when it's just a few feet above your head. Kent German/CNET

The coronavirus pandemic has now grounded almost all A380s in service, but the end of the program came in February 2019 when Airbus announced it would stop A380 production and deliver the last aircraft by 2021. ""Today's announcement is painful for us and the A380 communities worldwide,"" Airbus CEO Tom Enders said in a release at the time. ""But, keep in mind that A380s will still roam the skies for many years to come and Airbus will of course continue to fully support the A380 operators."" Around the same time, the first two A380s were scrapped for parts after flying for only a decade. Ten years is an incredibly short life for an aircraft -- it's not unusual to fly on planes more than twice that age.

When mass air travel can return, it's unclear how long the A380s will keep flying with airlines that aren't called Emirates. I hope the aircraft will be around for a few more years at least. It's a spacious way to fly, even when you're not in a premium class (though that certainly helps). And I had a ton of fun flying one in a British Airways simulator. If it does return, and flying on one yourself isn't in the cards, you have another option. Get yourself to an airport where A380s visit and wait near the end of the runway just before one's set to arrive. Watching the superjumbo thunder overhead just before touchdown, its four engines roaring as it blocks out the sun, is an incredible sight to behold. We've come a long way since that little Wright Flyer."
CIMON-2 makes its successful debut on the ISS - Airbus,"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC0wNC1jaW1vbi0yLW1ha2VzLWl0cy1zdWNjZXNzZnVsLWRlYnV0LW9uLXRoZS1pc3PSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Experimental technology for human-machine interaction in the space industry successfully masters the next stage of development in space

Scientific investigation into the effects of stress and isolation during long-term missions

Friedrichshafen, 15 April 2020 – CIMON-2, the updated version of the CIMON astronaut assistant, developed and built by Airbus for the German Aerospace Center Space Administration (DLR), has now demonstrated its capabilities during initial tests on the International Space Station (ISS). The free-flying, spherical technology demonstrator with artificial intelligence (AI) showed off a number of its features during interactions with ESA astronaut Luca Parmitano. CIMON-2 started its journey to the ISS on 05 December 2019, launching with the CRS-19 supply mission from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. It is scheduled to stay on the ISS for up to three years. Just shy of two months after the successful first use of CIMON-2, the project team has now received the analysis.



A number of tests have now been carried out on CIMON-2, for example on its autonomous flight capabilities, voice-controlled navigation, and its ability to understand and complete various tasks. It also managed to fly to a specific point in the ISS Columbus module for the first time. Thanks to absolute navigation capabilities, CIMON-2 was able to follow verbal commands to move to a particular location, regardless of where it was to begin with. For example, while starting up its new hardware and software, ESA´s Astronaut Luca Parmitano asked CIMON-2 to fly to the Biological Experiment Laboratory (Biolab) inside the Columbus module.



It was also given the task of taking photos and videos in the European ISS module on request – and then showing these to the astronaut. Using these capabilities, CIMON-2 will be able to help with future scientific experiments on the ISS.



The microphones of the current version of the technology demonstrator are more sensitive than its predecessor’s (CIMON), and it has a more advanced sense of direction. Its AI capabilities and the stability of its complex software applications have also been significantly improved. The degree of autonomy of the battery-powered assistant has been increased by around 30%. Astronauts can also activate a feature on CIMON-2 that allows it to analyse emotion in language and show empathy when interacting with the astronauts.



In addition, the project aims to research whether intelligent assistants such as CIMON could help reduce stress. As a partner and assistant, CIMON could support astronauts with their high workload of experiments and maintenance and repair work, thereby reducing their exposure to stress. CIMON lays the foundations for social assistance systems that could reduce stress resulting from isolation or group dynamics during long-term missions. Such systems could also possibly help to minimise similar problems back on Earth as well.



With the new improved hardware and complex software working so well, the CIMON team from DLR, Airbus, IBM, Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich (LMU) and the ESA User Support Centre Biotesc in Lucerne (Switzerland) are extremely satisfied with CIMON-2’s performance. This continued success of the CIMON project is yet another pioneering achievement in the use of AI in human space flight.

The CIMON ‘family’

The interactive astronaut assistant CIMON was developed and built by Airbus in Friedrichshafen and Bremen on behalf of the German Aerospace Center Space Administration (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt – DLR) and funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy. Watson AI technology from IBM Cloud provides voice-controlled artificial intelligence. Scientists from the Ludwig-Maximilian University Hospital in Munich (LMU) helped develop and oversee the human aspects of the assistance system. Biotesc at the University of Lucerne ensures that CIMON works perfectly in the Columbus module of the ISS and supports interaction of astronauts with CIMON from ground. Starting in August 2016, an approximately 50-strong project team from DLR, Airbus, IBM and LMU worked on the implementation of CIMON-1 for around two years. The prototype of the technology experiment flew on board the ISS from 02 July 2018 to 27 August 2019, and made its 90-minute debut – a world first – on 15 November 2018 with German ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst. It is no coincidence that CIMON’s name is reminiscent of ‘Professor Simon Wright’, the robotic assistant – or the ‘flying brain’ – from the Japanese science fiction series ‘Captain Future’. Following the successful CIMON-1 mission, the first European autonomous robot in human space flight was declared a German cultural asset and returned to Earth. The work on CIMON-2 was completed in less than a year by 20 employees from the CIMON ‘family’.

CIMON – the idea

Developed and built in Germany, CIMON is a technology experiment to support astronauts and increase the efficiency of their work. CIMON is able to show and explain information and instructions for scientific experiments and repairs. The voice-controlled access to documents and media is an advantage, as the astronauts can keep both hands free. It can also be used as a mobile camera to save astronaut crew time. In particular, CIMON could be used to perform routine tasks, such as documenting experiments, searching for objects and taking inventory. CIMON can also see, hear, understand and speak. CIMON can orientate itself using its ‘eyes’ – a stereo camera and a high-resolution camera that it uses for facial recognition – as well as two other cameras fitted to its sides that it uses for photos and video documentation. Ultrasound sensors measure distances to prevent potential collisions. Its ‘ears’ consist of eight microphones to identify directions, and an additional directional microphone to improve voice recognition. Its ‘mouth’ is a loudspeaker that it can use to speak or play music. At the heart of the AI for language understanding is IBM Watson AI technology from IBM Cloud. CIMON has not been equipped with self-learning capabilities and requires active human instruction. The AI used for autonomous navigation was provided by Airbus and is designed for movement planning and object recognition. Twelve internal rotors allow CIMON to move and rotate freely in all directions. This means it can turn towards the astronaut when addressed, nod and shake its head, and follow the astronaut – either autonomously or on command.

COVID-19 European Status: Airbus Contemplating Large A320 Production Cut - Defense & Security Monitor,"Mon, 06 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vZHNtLmZvcmVjYXN0aW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC5jb20vMjAyMC8wNC8wNi9jb3ZpZC0xOS1ldXJvcGVhbi1zdGF0dXMtYWlyYnVzLWNvbnRlbXBsYXRpbmctbGFyZ2UtYTMyMC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLWN1dC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"by J. Kasper Oestergaard, European Correspondent, Forecast International.

According to Reuters, Airbus is contemplating a large A320 production cut due to the fallout of COVID-19. Airlines are currently scrambling to preserve cash amid a huge drop in global air traffic caused by travel restrictions and closed off borders. Many airlines have either suspended all flights or reduced their flight schedule by as much as 60-95 percent. Airbus is reportedly examining scenarios that include cutting the current monthly output of 60 A320 family jets by up to 50 percent for a period of three to six months. Reuters also reports that A320 suppliers have been asked to reduce deliveries by 40 percent, a reduction that is compatible with the production of 36 jets per month.

Editor Note: Shortly after this article was published, Airbus announced that it would suspend production at its German sites in Bremen and Stade as well as at its US-based A220/A320 manufacturing facility in Mobile, Alabama. Commercial Aircraft production and assembly activities in Bremen will be paused until April 27. Airbus in Stade will pause production and assembly through April 11 , with some additional pause days in the weeks that follow in selected production departments. In Mobile, the pause in production is expected to last until April 29.

On April 9, Airbus detailed the production cuts.

Prior to COVID-19, Airbus was targeting a 5 percent rate increase to 63 jets per month from 2021 and was also discussing a further ramp-up with its supply chain that could have brought the production rate up to as high as 67 aircraft per month, or 804 per year, by 2023, putting the company within reach of a total of 1,000 jets delivered per year. Those plans have now been shelved.

According to an analysis published by IATA, revenues are expected to fall by 68 percent and airlines may burn through $61 billion of cash reserves during Q2 2020, while posting a quarterly net loss of $39 billion. On top of unavoidable fixed costs, many airlines have to refund sold tickets. Among nations providing aid packages to the industry are the United States, Australia, China, Colombia, New Zealand, Norway, and Singapore. Recently, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, and the Netherlands have relaxed regulations and are allowing airlines to offer passengers travel vouchers instead of refunds.

A final decision on an A320 production cut is expected at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on April 16. It is expected that Airbus will seek to avoid mandatory layoffs and instead make use of short-time working schemes at facilities in France and Germany.

Airbus is also studying major cuts in the production of A330 and A350 widebody jets. Suppliers on the A350 program are being instructed to run at half speed, equivalent to five aircraft per month. The monthly A330 production rate could be reduced to two down from 3.5.

By the end of February 2020, Airbus reported a backlog of 7,670 jets, of which 6,756, or 88 percent, were A220 and A320ceo/neo family narrowbodies. This represents 8.9 years of deliveries at the 2019 production level. While a slew of airline bankruptcies could certainly put a dent into Airbus’ order book, most of the damage will likely be caused by the ongoing uncertainty and reduction in near-term business activity. Even in bankruptcy, airlines will often choose to retain their orders as they may need the capacity in the future, but would cancel or seek to postpone near-term deliveries until air traffic volumes normalize. As for U.S. airlines, carriers emerging from Chapter 11 reorganization have cleaner balance sheets and thus, while not obligated to, are more likely to make good on their orders assuming they need the capacity.

2020 Forecast

Forecast International’s Platinum Forecast System® is a breakthrough in forecasting technology which, among many other features, provides 15-year production forecasts. The author has used the Platinum Forecast System to retrieve the latest delivery forecast figures and, for 2020, Forecast International’s analysts expect Airbus to deliver 692 commercial jets. Currently, there is much uncertainty surrounding this figure. When Airbus officially announces its production plans for the coming months, there will be more clarity.

Update on COVID-19 in Europe

As of Saturday April 4, Spain overtook Italy and is now the country in Europe with the most reported COVID-19 cases to date, with Italy coming in as a close second. The two nations account for a combined 38 percent (45% one week ago) of Europe’s 643,263 reported COVID-19 cases and 58 percent (73%) of the continent’s 46,407 deaths. In Italy alone, the number of fatalities last week surpassed the 15,000 mark. Germany has reported 92,150 cases, or 14 percent, of total European cases, but “only” accounts for 1,330 fatalities, or 3 percent, which is certainly a figure that stands out. Worldwide, Europe Accounts for 54 percent of total COVID-19 cases and 73 percent of fatalities. With key manufacturing operations in France, Germany, Spain and the U.K. and, to a lesser extent, Italy, Airbus and its employees are significantly impacted by the war on COVID-19.

While deaths are still high, it appears that the worst could soon be over in Spain and Italy. Daily new cases seem to have peaked in Italy on March 21 at 6,557 and have been coming in well below 5,000 for five days in a row. In Spain, the highest number of daily new cases so far was on March 26.

Airbus achieves world's first fully automatic refuelling contacts - Airbus,"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC0wNC1haXJidXMtYWNoaWV2ZXMtd29ybGRzLWZpcnN0LWZ1bGx5LWF1dG9tYXRpYy1yZWZ1ZWxsaW5nLWNvbnRhY3Rz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Getafe, 17 April 2020 – Airbus has achieved the first ever fully automatic air-to-air refuelling (A3R) operation with a boom system. The flight test campaign, conducted earlier in the year over the Atlantic Ocean, involved an Airbus tanker test aircraft equipped with the Airbus A3R solution, with an F-16 fighter aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force acting as a receiver.

This milestone is part of the industrialisation phase of A3R systems ahead of its implementation in the A330 MRTT tanker development.

The campaign achieved a total of 45 flight test hours and 120 dry contacts with the A3R system, covering the whole aerial refuelling envelope, as the F-16 and MRTT consolidate the maturity and capabilities of the development at this stage. The certification phase will start in 2021.

Didier Plantecoste, Airbus Head of Tanker and Derivatives Programmes, said: “The achievement of this key milestone for the A3R programme highlights the A330 MRTT’s excellent capability roadmap development and once more confirms that our tanker is the world’s reference for present and future refuelling operations. Our special thanks go to the Portuguese Air Force for their continued support and help on this crucial development”.

The A3R system requires no additional equipment on the receiver aircraft and is intended to reduce air refuelling operator (ARO) workload, improve safety and optimise the rate of air-to-air refuelling transfer in operational conditions, helping maximise aerial superiority. The goal for the A3R system is to develop technologies that will reach fully autonomous capabilities.

Once the system is activated by the ARO, the A3R flies the boom automatically and keeps the alignment between the boom tip and the receiver receptacle with an accuracy of a couple of centimeters; the proper alignment and the receiver stability is checked in real-time to keep a safe distance between the boom and the receiver and also to determine the optimum moment to extend the telescopic beam to achieve the connection with the receiver. At this point, the fuel transfer is initiated to fill up the receiver aircraft and once completed and the disconnection is commanded, the boom is cleared away from the receiver by retracting the telescopic beam and flying the boom away to keep a safe separation distance. During this process, the ARO simply monitors the operation.

New “eTech 3D Repair” portable tool introduced with airlines - Airbus Aircraft,"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYWlyY3JhZnQuYWlyYnVzLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzcm9vbS9uZXdzLzIwMjAtMDQtbmV3LWV0ZWNoLTNkLXJlcGFpci1wb3J0YWJsZS10b29sLWludHJvZHVjZWQtd2l0aC1haXJsaW5lc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is introducing with airlines a new integrated solution for recording, assessing, monitoring and reporting aircraft structural damage via a tablet based portable tool. Called “eTech 3D Repair”, it can be used on the flight line by pilots and mechanics. Damage localisation is quickly and easily performed thanks to the built-in 3D aircraft models, and the tool provides a complete historical view of any previous damage logged for the aircraft. As well as making it easy to record damage characteristics in one click, eTech 3D Repair guides the user in assessing damage by giving access to the relevant digital structural repair manual (SRM) “ATA” chapters, as well as part names. eTech 3D Repair also includes a lookup function for consulting supplier manuals. If no standard repair solution is already listed in the SRM, then the tool facilitates a direct way to contact engineering to initiate an “Airbus Tech Request”. It is therefore possible to share quickly and efficiently all the damage data with the aircraft manufacturer or a FAR Part 21 repair organisation [or contact other suppliers by email], thus avoiding time-consuming message exchanges and administrative paperwork. The tool also enables maintenance staff to obtain rapid approval from the authorities for the repair, which will reduce the delay in putting the aircraft back into service.

In summary, the new solution, which replaces Airbus’ PC-based “Repair Manager” system, now brings mobility with a handheld device, making it usable by line mechanics and pilots, and generating significant time savings. It allows them to avoid dependence on paperwork, provides them with easy access to digital documentation, quickly shares information with OEM, ensures full damage traceability, and produces damage reports quickly – which is key to ensure the compliance of the airline’s process with regulations."

The first customer to adopt the remote end-to-end process is Pegasus Airlines, which in the last few days received three brand new ‘e-delivered’ A320neo Family aircraft. More airlines will follow likewise in the coming days and weeks. This new e-Delivery approach comprises three main stages: (a) Technical Acceptance Completion (TAC) tasks delegated to Airbus (or to a local third party appointed by the airline); (b) electronic Transfer-of-Title (electronic ToT); and (c) ferry-flight and subsequent reception of the aircraft at the customer’s base.

For the TAC (which is a prerequisite for ToT) the airline can delegate Airbus to perform, on its behalf, all the necessary actions. These include the ‘ground-check’, the acceptance test flight, acceptance manuals and procedures, as well as minor cosmetic rework if needed. Then for the ToT completion, Airbus’ and customers’ teams take benefit from a new secure collaborative platform: “e-SalesContracts”. This brings them all together – wherever they happen to be – into one real-time virtual environment where they can optimise and simplify all the contractual transactions, from the paperless drafting and commercially negotiating the delivery documents up to the remote ToT digital signature. This platform thus obviates the need for any of the customer’s own staff to be physically present at the Airbus Delivery Centre. After the TAC and ToT formalities are complete, the subsequent ferry-flight is also performed in a health-wise safe manner whereby the customer’s own flight crew (or an appointed third party) can pick-up the sanitised aircraft and fly it straight back from the delivery centre to the airline’s home base.

As well as affording a means of safe business continuity during the current COVID-19 crisis, the e-Delivery process, especially its new collaborative digital aspects – which confer enhanced workflow efficiencies, flexibility, transparency, plus a more environmentally-friendly and smoother overall customer experience – could become the blueprint for Airbus and its customers going forward.

Airbus Customer Services teams are working hard to adapt maintenance recommendations and support customers which have fleets partially or wholly grounded during this period. The situation calls for exceptional measures and reactivity to provide pragmatic support to operators during this difficult period, while keeping the highest levels of safety. To this end, Airbus is helping airlines to reduce the huge and sudden maintenance workload, and to ensure a quick return to service of their aircraft when required. In addition to increasing its support teams and giving recommendations to customers, Airbus is providing technical justifications and solutions for maintenance burden reduction. This includes extending calendar intervals for scheduled maintenance tasks and reducing the frequency of periodic ground checks wherever justified by experience and engineering analysis. Airbus has published technical data via Operators Information Transmissions (OITs). Customers can submit technical queries directly to Airbus Customer Services via the AirbusWorld portal. For a comprehensive overview on aircraft storage measures, please consult the latest Airbus online FAST article on this subject:

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has approved the A330-800 for ETOPS (Extended-range Twin-engine Operations) “beyond 180 minutes” diversion time. This achievement means that operators of this A330neo variant will benefit from the most efficient, reliable and direct long-range routings. In particular it will maximise the A330-800’s exceptional transpacific range capability of up to 8,150nm.

The latest approval for the -800, which includes ETOPS 180 minutes capability in the aircraft’s basic specification, also includes the option for “ETOPS 285 minutes”. This extends the potential air diversion distance to around 2,000nm. The US FAA’s respective ETOPS certification for the A330-800 is expected soon. The similar ETOPS approval for the larger A330-900 took place in January 2019.

The A330-800, which in February 2020 received its joint Type Certification from EASA and the FAA, like the larger A330-900 model incorporates highly efficient Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, a new 3D-optimised wing with greater span and lighter composite materials, plus new wingtip Sharklets.

A321XLR programme development and industrialisation gathers pace

Following its launch at the Paris Air Show last year, the industrialisation of the A321XLR long range single-aisle programme is underway and the aircraft’s design is moving from concept to reality. By early 2020, the first long-lead components for the initial A321XLR flight-test aircraft were already in production – including the main landing gear forgings by Safran and the first parts for the centre wingbox by Airbus in Nantes.

Most recently, in March, Airbus completed its supplier selection for the new major components and systems which are specifically being designed for the A321XLR variant. These suppliers include: Spirit AeroSystems (inboard single-slotted flap); Diehl Aviation (potable water & water waste systems); FACC (modified belly fairing); Premium Aerotec (rear-centre fuel tank primary structure); Collins Aerospace (fuel system); Parker Aerospace (fuel tank inerting system); Vincorion (heated floor panels); Safran (main and nose landing gear); and Triumph Group (landing gear uplock mechanism).

In anticipation of the industrialisation phase, where relevant, the programme is applying Airbus’ new “digital design, manufacturing and services” (DDMS) product lifecycle approach. This enables accurate virtual factory simulations to validate investments and ramp-up planning. A key pillar of the DDMS framework is the 3D “Digital Mock-up Unit” (DMU) database, which will allow concurrent design, assembly simulations, and real-time 3D visibility across the transnational co-design plateaus at Toulouse, Hamburg and Filton. Furthermore, the A321XLR programme brings the benefits of 3D visualisation to the non-engineering community, including programme managers – who can now work in 3D thanks to 3D viewer tools.

In addition to the aforementioned digital environments, the installation of complementary physical demonstrators is also well underway for ‘validation and verification’ (V&V) of the various new structures and equipment of the A321XLR. For example, the Structures Demonstrator programme includes ‘major component assembly’ (MCA) join-up of fuselage sections 15 & 17, fuselage integration of the new rear-centre-[fuel]-tank, plus other modules and detailed parts. In parallel, the Equipment Demonstrator programme features physical trial installation in a full-size wooden mock-up by a multi-functional team representing each installed system, with experts from Engineering, Manufacturing Engineering, Production, Maintenance and Ergonomics. This approach minimises design clashes, as well as optimising ergonomics. Testing of the cabin comfort for long-range operations has already started, including the use of a climatic test chamber on ground.

To date, 24 customers have ordered a total of more than 450 A321XLRs, validating the market need for the unique capabilities offered by this aircraft. Flight-testing is due to start in 2022, and service entry from 2023. The A321XLR will provide airlines with a range of up to 4,700nm and a 30% lower fuel burn per seat compared with previous-generation competitor aircraft.

Airbus has recently received certification for a new digital audio cockpit system, “Digital Radio and Audio Integrating Management System” (DRAIMS) for the A320 Family – which replaces the current analogue audio systems. DRAIMS, which features new Audio Management systems and new Control Panels with a large modern digital display, multifunction keys and a numeric keypad, handles all cockpit communication tasks. During a flight, the system facilitates clearer communication between pilots, cabin crew and the ground to ensure safety of flight, answer to air traffic control, or prepare for ground operations. Benefits of DRAIMS include 30% weight saving – compared with the previous analogue architecture. Furthermore, installation lead-time is now reduced due to the much simplified wiring between the cockpit and the avionics bay. It is also more robust, offers advanced back-up capability and improves A/C dispatch capability. Currently being evaluated in-service, DRAIMS will be installed as standard from mid-2021 for the A320 Family. Certification for the A330 Family is planned for around the end of 2020, and subsequently for the A350 XWB.

Airbus has expanded its digital offering for airlines with a new solution, Performance Factor Optimizer, connected to Airbus’ Skywise open data platform. Developed by NAVBLUE, Airbus’ Flight Operations subsidiary, the new app provides an accurate interpretation of the performance variation for each Airbus aircraft, on an individual aircraft basis. This web-based solution automatically computes the “delta specific range” (DSR) and the associated performance factors used in the Flight Management System (FMS) and the flight planning system, with an automatic aircraft performance database pairing. Performance varies over the life of all in-service aircraft, leading to slightly higher fuel consumption levels as an aircraft ages. This is attributed to degradation effects, which impact both the engines and airframe. The Performance Factor Optimizer application automatically identifies and investigates the resulting DSR trends over time, allowing a more continuous and regular monitoring while reducing the operator workload. As a next step, using the power of additional aircraft data sources (QAR, DAR, SAR*) the app will enable an increased number of points to be analysed, resulting in better coverage of the flight phases for even greater accuracy.

New “eTech 3D Repair” portable tool introduced with airlines

Airbus is introducing with airlines a new integrated solution for recording, assessing, monitoring and reporting aircraft structural damage via a tablet based portable tool. Called “eTech 3D Repair”, it can be used on the flight line by pilots and mechanics. Damage localisation is quickly and easily performed thanks to the built-in 3D aircraft models, and the tool provides a complete historical view of any previous damage logged for the aircraft. As well as making it easy to record damage characteristics in one click, eTech 3D Repair guides the user in assessing damage by giving access to the relevant digital structural repair manual (SRM) “ATA” chapters, as well as part names. eTech 3D Repair also includes a lookup function for consulting supplier manuals. If no standard repair solution is already listed in the SRM, then the tool facilitates a direct way to contact engineering to initiate an “Airbus Tech Request”. It is therefore possible to share quickly and efficiently all the damage data with the aircraft manufacturer or a FAR Part 21 repair organisation [or contact other suppliers by email], thus avoiding time-consuming message exchanges and administrative paperwork. The tool also enables maintenance staff to obtain rapid approval from the authorities for the repair, which will reduce the delay in putting the aircraft back into service.

In summary, the new solution, which replaces Airbus’ PC-based “Repair Manager” system, now brings mobility with a handheld device, making it usable by line mechanics and pilots, and generating significant time savings. It allows them to avoid dependence on paperwork, provides them with easy access to digital documentation, quickly shares information with OEMs, ensures full damage traceability, and produces damage reports quickly – which is key to ensure the compliance of the airline’s process with regulations.

New manufacturing milling centre operational in Finkenwerder

Airbus has opened a new Manufacturing Milling Centre (MMC) in Hamburg at its Finkenwerder site, following a year of construction. Brighter, more ergonomic, more interconnected than the previous facility, all processes for the production of wing corner fittings and special parts production for structural assembly are now located under one roof, from the milling shop to surface protection. The Hamburg MMC stands out for its new system technology, in particular regarding the transfer of data for on-demand production which is now all-digital. This works both interactively and visually, such that staff in the Final Assembly Line (FAL) can see the real-time situation in the MCC and vice versa. Moreover, the optimised workflow ensures rapid transit between completion, collection of the fittings and their installation at the FAL. In addition, quality inspections, which were previously performed manually are now automated thanks to two robot-assisted measuring units employing 3D scanners. Also contributing to the production efficiencies are two overhead cranes which allow the set-up of two milling machines at the same time. The new MMC location also improves the working conditions for the specially qualified employees, with large windows for more light and fresh air. In addition, the surface area of 1,100 square metres offers optimised ergonomic conditions and sufficient space for the required logistics areas.

First resin-transfer-moulded large component produced for A320 Family

The first shipset of composite A320 wing spoilers to be produced using an advanced automated manufacturing technique called Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) was delivered last month from a new facility jointly managed by Airbus and Spirit AeroSystems in Prestwick, UK. This milestone represents one of the first uses of RTM in commercial aviation for large components. The technique involves injecting resin into dry fibres in a press rather than the traditional, more expensive and time-consuming method of ‘baking’ pre-impregnated carbon fibre and honeycomb in large pressurised autoclaves. RTM enables each part to be manufactured to be identical, to within hundredths of a millimetre, which not only realises significant time and cost savings but also “right-first-time” quality for the RTM spoilers, resulting in more efficient assembly operations downstream at the Broughton wing factory. The first set of spoilers will undergo certification in the coming weeks, as well as trial fits at Broughton and then functionality test at the Final Assembly Line (FAL). The € 50 million project, which will bring around 80 jobs to the region, was launched in 2017 and is joint-funded by Airbus, its supply partner Spirit AeroSystems and the local government."

Posted on April 20, 2020

Engineers from Airbus and faculty from the University of South Alabama are working with healthcare workers at USA Health during the coronavirus pandemic to produce hundreds of reusable face masks for providers in clinics and hospitals.

One of the team members is John Ding, who earned a master’s degree in business administration from South and is an aircraft engineer at Airbus.

“At Airbus, we do a lot of 3D printing, we try all kinds of stuff,” Ding said. “And we’d seen on the news that people around the country were using printers to make masks. We knew we wanted to do something, but we didn’t know where, so I decided to reach out to the University.”

The first call went to Dr. Robert Cloutier, who teaches systems engineering classes for Airbus employees. The next step was a conference call with Dr. Matthew Reichert, who uses 3D printing in his chemistry research lab, and Lynne Chronister, vice president for research and economic development at South.

The COVID-19 response soon reached Dr. Benjamin Estrada, an infectious disease specialist at USA Health. Instead of face shields, which was the initial idea, he suggested making what’s called a “Montana mask,” which has a replaceable filter and a hard nylon shell that can be washed and reused.

Within just a few weeks, the Mobile Airbus engineers should be able to print 500 masks with adjustable straps. The Airbus employees work at the company’s engineering and assembly centers at Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley.

“Kudos to Airbus,” said Estrada, who’s also a professor and assistant dean at South’s College of Medicine. “They’ve done a great job for us. This will definitely help our healthcare workers be better protected.”

Nick Simpson, an Airbus project leader, was one of many who joined the mask-making project.

“I’m excited to be helping the local medical community using the skills I and other team members normally use for making things fly,” Simpson said. “We’ve had some very clever people working on this, and we are gratified to help our local medical teams where and when it’s most needed.”

Through aggressive conservation, USA Health has not faced the extreme shortages of personal protective equipment seen in some parts of the country, Estrada said, but administrators are concerned about maintaining stockpiles at University Hospital, Children’s & Women’s Hospital, Mitchell Cancer Institute and USA Health clinics.

The Airbus masks will not replace N95 respirator masks, which have run short at hospitals across the country. They do, however, meet requirements from the National Institutes of Health, and will provide an alternative to surgical masks.

“For the large majority of patient contact, we use standard surgical masks, and these are an excellent backup,” Estrada said. “The advantage is that they can be re-used, so you’re extending the life of the masks. It seems to be a very clever design. And they use a rubber window seal, so air doesn’t escape, and it’s actually a better seal than with a typical mask.”

In the chemistry department at South, Reichert is using a few 3D printers to produce tension-relief bands for the Airbus masks as well as for N95 and surgical masks. It takes about two-and-a-half hours for a printer to produce nine adjustable straps. They are also being printed at Mobile Makerspace by Ricky Green, an information technology instructor in South’s School of Computing.

At Airbus, meanwhile, there are seven 3D printers producing the larger nylon mask pieces, which take about five hours to complete. Finally, filters and bands are attached to complete the masks.

The division of labor was worked out in about a week.

“It was kind of serendipitous,” Reichert said. “I wasn’t sure what the Airbus capabilities were for 3D printing, and then they were reaching out to us. If John hadn’t had that connection to South, it would have taken a lot longer to get going.”

Ding, the Airbus engineer with the MBA from South, said many of his colleagues and co-workers volunteered to work on the project. On Friday, the Airbus and University teams working on the project made the first delivery to Estrada’s office at the Strada Patient Care Center in Midtown.

“We feel pretty good about the whole project,” Ding said. “The whole team is pretty engaged at this time.”"
Airbus will support France and India to monitor climate change with TRISHNA - Airbus,"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC0wNC1haXJidXMtd2lsbC1zdXBwb3J0LWZyYW5jZS1hbmQtaW5kaWEtdG8tbW9uaXRvci1jbGltYXRlLWNoYW5nZS13aXRo0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris, 20 April 2020 – The French Space Agency (Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales, CNES) has recently signed a contract with Airbus Defence and Space for the development and manufacture of the thermal infrared instrument for the TRISHNA satellite.

TRISHNA (Thermal infraRed Imaging Satellite for High resolution Natural resource Assessment) will be the latest satellite in the joint Franco-Indian satellite fleet dedicated to climate monitoring and operational applications. CNES and ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) are partnering on the development of an infrared observation system with high thermal resolution and high revisit capability including a satellite and associated ground segment.

TRISHNA observations will enhance our understanding of the water cycle and improve management of the planet’s precious water resources, to better define the impacts of climate change, especially at local levels.

In the international partnership workshare, ISRO will provide the platform, the visible and short wave infrared instrument and will be the prime contractor for the satellite, while CNES is co-responsible for the mission and will provide the thermal infrared instrument, to be developed by Airbus. The ground segment is shared between both countries.

For this mission, Airbus is leveraging the latest innovations and synergies from other programmes (IASI-NG, CO3D…) to offer an affordable high performance instrument, with the aim of encouraging development of a commercial market.

Measuring surface temperatures provides information on hydric stress - a lack of water - and its impact on the vegetative cycle, and this monitoring of water and energy cycles is one of the main objectives of the mission, to be applied particularly in agriculture and hydrology. This mission will also serve numerous other applications: surveillance of continental and coastal waters, follow up of urban heat traps, risk monitoring (fire detection and volcanic activity), study of the cryosphere (glaciers, frozen lakes) and radiation budget assessment.

TRISHNA represents a significant step forward, both in terms of resolution and refresh rate, compared with existing missions, improving research opportunities and enabling further development of applications.

While existing missions are limited in terms of resolution (above 1km) and with revisit only every few weeks, TRISHNA will image the Earth every three days, at 50m resolution, observing a wide temperature range, from approx. -20°C to +30°C, with high precision (0.3°C).

Jean-Marc Nasr, Head of Space Systems at Airbus said: “Thanks to ambitious science missions like TRISHNA, our industry has reached a technological maturity that opens up a new era of commercial observation of the Earth and all related applications. France’s world-leading expertise in the Earth observation export market, combined with the unmatched efficiency and ambition of the Indian Space industry is going to bring thermal infrared imagery to a new level. This will enable breakthrough applications in agriculture, urban and coastal zone management, meteorology, climate science and many commercial applications.”

Mission accomplished: Airbus helicopter hailing service Voom closes down - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 01 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXItdm9vbS1jZWFzZXMtb3BlcmF0aW9ucy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus’s helicopter booking service Voom has permanently ceased operation, citing completion of its twin goals of establishing a first-to-market rotorcraft ridesharing platform and “democratizing the urban skies.”

The ongoing coronavirus pandemic forced Voom to shutter its operations in São Paulo, Brazil; Mexico City; and the San Francisco Bay area on March 23. A week later, Voom chief executive Clément Monnet, in concert with Airbus leadership, “made the tough call that Voom will not resume its operations.”

Voom launched in 2016 as one part of a multi-pronged effort by Airbus to position itself for the emerging eVTOL and urban air mobility market. Using helicopters, the company tackled the logistical challenges of providing efficient, safe, relatively affordable air mobility in major urban centers before next-generation aircraft come online.

In four years, Voom grew from a project inside Airbus’ innovation center in Silicon Valley, A3 or Acubed, to a multinational company, but scaling the app-based flight-booking service from Brazil to Mexico, San Francisco, and elsewhere proved a difficult hurdle, according to Monnet.

“Scaling globally isn’t easy for any business, and we found this to be especially true in an expensive industry with a truly transformative model for both Airbus and the transportation market as a whole,” Monnet wrote in a March 30 blog post announcing the closure. “Couple these truths with the recent COVID-19 pandemic, and we have been faced with some hard choices, as are so many businesses today. . . . While we would have loved to continue our ambitious work, we have achieved our two major initial goals for this project.”

Voom chose as its initial launch cities three of the most populous and traffic-clogged metropolitan areas in the world. It managed to amass 150,000 total active users and fly 15,000 passengers during its relatively short period of operation. It partnered with existing Airbus-vetted third-party helicopter operators and helipads to deliver its service in those cities.

Voom’s São Paulo, Brazil, operation began in 2017, Mexico City the following year, and the company ultimately ran a network of six helipads in and around both cities. San Francisco was seen as a launchpad to establish operations elsewhere in the U.S., but Voom never chose another city in which to expand.

In its first year of operation, 60 percent of Voom customers were first-time helicopter users, “proving that we truly opened the skies to a new audience,” Monnet said.

“We achieved a 45 percent repeat customer rate and an average ticket price equivalent to 2x the cost of a private car service for 1/10th of the time, making accessible and affordable urban air transportation a reality,” he said.

That was enough to satisfy Voom’s primary goal of launching a mobile helicopter booking platform that provided Airbus with behavioral and operational data about urban air mobility (UAM) in globally representative markets.

“We learned a lot about customer preferences — booking and movement patterns, most popular routes, willingness to pay — as well as about operational challenges related to lack of infrastructure, public acceptance, on-demand versus scheduled routes, etc.,” Monnet said.

Airbus will use the data to inform decisions on the design of any future eVTOL vehicle, including the average number of passengers per flight, ideal flight time, optimum end-to-end customer experience, and expected infrastructure costs.

Monnet said he is “extremely proud” of the Voom team of employees, made up of “aviation enthusiasts who are passionate about urban air mobility” and who worked “to improve people’s lives by giving them access to urban skies.”

Making UAM a reality with eVTOL aircraft within the decade poses real and difficult challenges to the aerospace and other industries, Monnet said. Airbus continues to invest in the technologies that will be required to realize that reality, he wrote.

“This is just one chapter in urban air mobility, with so much more to come,” he said. “It is not a question of whether the UAM market will open up, but when.”"

Airbus engages 'remote delivery' initiative to transfer aircraft to customers - Flightglobal,"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mbGlnaHRnbG9iYWwuY29tL29yZGVycy1hbmQtZGVsaXZlcmllcy9haXJidXMtZW5nYWdlcy1yZW1vdGUtZGVsaXZlcnktaW5pdGlhdGl2ZS10by10cmFuc2Zlci1haXJjcmFmdC10by1jdXN0b21lcnMvMTM3OTgwLmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has started capitalising on communications technology and amended logistical procedures to enable delivery of aircraft remotely, allowing it to continue handing over jets to customers despite the restrictive measures imposed by the coronavirus crisis.

Turkish budget carrier Pegasus Airlines has received three Airbus A320neo-family jets through the remote process – dubbed ‘e-Delivery’ by the airframer – which combines a delegated technical acceptance completion with an electronic transfer-of-title, before the aircraft is picked up for ferry, either by the customer or a third party.

“Business continuity is not just a buzz-word,” Airbus head of contracts delivery Alain Vilanove tells FlightGlobal. “It’s a reality to Airbus.”

Vilanove says the airframer had been using the electronic transfer-of-title capability for some 45-50 deliveries over the past year.

But with government restrictions and changes to working practices obstructing routine deliveries, leading to newly-completed aircraft being parked, Airbus has incorporated this capability into a broader ‘virtual’ end-to-end process.

Vilanove believes the efficiency and cost-savings of the ‘e-Delivery’ scheme – through reduced travel and accommodation expense, and eliminating the need for customers’ key personnel to leave their workplace – mean it is likely to become a regular option, even after the crisis passes.

“We’ve seen a trend. We’re going to use this tool more and more,” he says. Vilanove envisions a substantial proportion of deliveries, perhaps 30% or more, being conducted remotely within a couple of years.

“I personally don’t see a negative side to this,” he says, although he acknowledges that some customers might still prefer the social engagement that accompanies deliveries.

Technical acceptance is the first stage of the formal process and the customer can delegate this aspect to Airbus through the final assembly line customer manager. Completion includes ground checks, acceptance test flight and documentation, and – if necessary – any cosmetic refinements.

Vilanove says a customer’s willingness to allow this work to be conducted remotely illustrates its “ultimate proof of trust” in the airframer.

The technical acceptance is a condition of transfer-of-title, which is undertaken through a secure collaborative sales contract platform.

“This brings them all together, wherever they happen to be, into one real-time virtual environment where they can optimise and simplify all the contractual transactions,” the airframer states.

The process allows paperless drafting of delivery documentation up to, and including, the digital signature for transfer-of-title – without the need for any of the customer’s own personnel to be present at the Airbus delivery facility. This is particularly valuable given the quarantine requirements implemented by several countries’ governments.

But the aircraft, sanitised as part of the delivery, still needs to be flown to the customer’s base and this is carried out through a pick-up by an inbound crew – either the customer’s own or third-party pilots – with procedures which follow the current health-and-safety guidelines.

“We want to offer a totally contained process from arrival to departure,” says Vilanove.

He says aircraft deliveries are taking longer than usual, because of the changes in working practice, but that the ‘e-Delivery’ scheme under normal circumstances should be able to offer customers a smoother and more efficient delivery process and become the “blueprint” for future handovers."
Airbus profit plunges in ‘gravest crisis’ for aviation industry - Al Jazeera English,"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vZWNvbm9teS8yMDIwLzQvMjkvYWlyYnVzLXByb2ZpdC1wbHVuZ2VzLWluLWdyYXZlc3QtY3Jpc2lzLWZvci1hdmlhdGlvbi1pbmR1c3RyedIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vYW1wL2Vjb25vbXkvMjAyMC80LzI5L2FpcmJ1cy1wcm9maXQtcGx1bmdlcy1pbi1ncmF2ZXN0LWNyaXNpcy1mb3ItYXZpYXRpb24taW5kdXN0cnk?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The planemaker’s CEO said cutting production and laying off staff may be just the start of coping with lower demand.

Planemaker Airbus has posted a 49 percent slump in first-quarter adjusted operating profit to 281 million euros ($304.7m) as revenue dropped 15 percent to 10.631 billion euros ($11.56bn) amid the “gravest crisis the aerospace industry has ever known”, said Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury.

Europe’s largest aerospace group also reported on Wednesday a negative cashflow of 8.03 billion euros ($8.73bn), including a previously published record fine of 3.6 billion euros ($3.91bn) to settle bribery and corruption investigations in the United Kingdom, France and the United States.

Planemakers, airlines and suppliers have been left reeling by the coronavirus pandemic, which has crippled passenger travel and catapulted major economies into recession.

“The crisis is really unprecedented,” Faury said on a call. “It’s hitting all regions of the globe and all industries at the same time so the role of governments is obviously key. One of the major risks for us is suppliers going bust.”

Faury said the measures taken by Airbus so far, which include cutting annual production by slightly over one-third and temporarily laying off more than 6,000 workers, maybe just the start, and it will review the situation in June when there may be more visibility into the direction the crisis is headed.

Airbus suspended its profit outlook, scrapped its dividend and negotiated new commercial credit lines last month as the spread of the coronavirus began to affect airline operations and almost halted the delivery of aircraft.

Several other top aerospace firms are also expected to report weaker results on Wednesday, including US rival Boeing, which is also hit by the continued grounding of its 737 MAX, though the impact of the coronavirus is mostly expected in the second quarter.

Airbus said it would focus squarely on saving cash.

The France-based group will reduce 2020 capital expenditure by approximately 700 million euros ($760.91m) to nearly 1.9 billion euros ($2.07bn) and defer or suspend activities which are “not critical to business continuity” or meeting other commitments."

April 8, 2020, © Leeham News: Airbus today said it will cut production of the A320, A330, and A350 lines due to COVID-19.

The new rates are:

A320 to rate 40 per month (from 60-63);

A330 to rate 2 per month (from 3.5)

A350 to rate 6 per month (from 10)

Airbus is still assessing the A220 production rate. The Mirabel facility will return to 4/mo (from 5) but the Mobile (AL) facility is coming on line. Production is currently suspended to the end of the month.

“We are still assessing our industrial planning to adapt to the rapidly evolving situation as best as is possible in the current context,” an Airbus spokesman said.

“We are preparing our operations in Mirabel for restarting at a progressive return to rate 4, which we plan to stabilize until mid-2021, while our plan in Mobile is unchanged for now.” Mobile is producing at 1-2/mo.

The plunge in oil prices is the last thing Boeing and Airbus need right now - CNBC,"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDIwLzA0LzIwL3RoZS1vaWwtcGx1bmdlLWlzLXRoZS1sYXN0LXRoaW5nLWJvZWluZy1hbmQtYWlyYnVzLW5lZWRzLW9uLXRvcC1vZi10aGUtY29yb25hdmlydXMtcGFuZGVtaWMuaHRtbNIBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMC8wNC8yMC90aGUtb2lsLXBsdW5nZS1pcy10aGUtbGFzdC10aGluZy1ib2VpbmctYW5kLWFpcmJ1cy1uZWVkcy1vbi10b3Atb2YtdGhlLWNvcm9uYXZpcnVzLXBhbmRlbWljLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rising oil prices can help boost sales of more fuel-efficient aircraft, the opposite of sales trends for larger personal vehicles like SUVs.

""One thing that kept the industry aloft during the great financial meltdown [in 2008] is fuel prices actually rose,"" said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at vice president at Teal Group, referring to record oil prices that year.

The duopoly that dominates most of the world's aircraft production spent more than a decade racking up record orders for planes they boasted could save millions in fuel.

The coronavirus pandemic, the threat of airline bankruptcies and a global recession. Now a historic oil glut and price crash are adding to the woes of Boeing and Airbus.

The Airbus A320neo and the Boeing 737 Max, each manufacturer's best-selling narrow-body airplanes were developed after the Great Recession when fuel prices were again rising and airlines were on the hunt for models that would help them cut fuel costs. Both companies amassed years of orders for thousands of planes.

But manufacturers have lost that selling point, adding to a slate of challenges that are expected to last at least into 2021, if not later, and a sharp turnaround from earlier this year when airlines couldn't get new single-aisle airplanes fast enough.

Aboulafia estimates that manufacturers of large aircraft like Airbus and Boeing should net around 1,000 canceled orders this year combined, an unprecedented drop compared with 681 net orders last year. Boeing, already reeling from the grounding of its 737 Max after two fatal crashes, is posting an increasing number of canceled orders. Airbus, for its part, earlier this month said it would cut aircraft production rates by about a third ""to adapt to the new Coronavirus market environment.""

As the pandemic causes travel demand to crater and cities lock down, jet-fuel demand is falling faster than other products made from oil. Globally, jet-fuel demand is set to drop 47% in the second quarter from a year earlier, nearly twice the rate of the forecast decline in gasoline consumption and more than three times the rate of the drop in diesel, which is crucial for freight transportation, according to estimates from S&P Global Platts. Jet-fuel prices in the U.S. fell more than 65% since the start of the year as of Friday's close.

""The problem that's what's happening right now is [the crisis] is hitting all the countries at the same time,"" said Claudio Galimberti, head of oil demand, refining and agriculture analytics at S&P Global Platts.

Airlines are now focused on slashing flights to match paltry demand from would-be travelers as they navigate stay-at-home orders and other severe measures aimed at stopping the virus from spreading.

Those carriers are also parking hundreds of planes and deferring orders of new planes. Some customers are canceling orders altogether, spelling more pain for aircraft manufacturers. While airlines are planning to accelerate the retirement of older, less fuel-efficient jets, but that isn't expected to be enough to spur a flurry of new orders with a recovery in air travel demand still unclear.

Airlines for America, a lobbying group that includes American , Delta , United Southwest and other large U.S. carriers, said as of April 15, U.S. airlines had idled more than 2,700 planes, more than 44% of their fleet."

Airbus Helicopters mobilizes to keep customers flying in service of the COVID-19 crisis - Airbus,"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTA0LWFpcmJ1cy1oZWxpY29wdGVycy1tb2JpbGl6ZXMtdG8ta2VlcC1jdXN0b21lcnMtZmx5aW5nLWluLXNlcnZpY2Utb2YtdGhl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Images: Armée de l’air, Sebastien Bozon – AFP, Frederick Florin – AFP, SAMU 21 - CHU Dijon Bourgogne

As COVID-19 continues its spread around the globe, stressing healthcare systems and disrupting daily life and business operations, many of Airbus’ helicopter customers have found themselves on the front lines of their countries’ efforts to combat the virus, helping hospitals and governments provide air medical transport and other critical services.

Encompassing emergency medical services (EMS), para-public and military fleets, these customers need Airbus Helicopters now more than ever to keep business running so that they can continue to perform their life-saving missions. Airbus Helicopters has been doing everything it can to ensure that the availability rate of the different French SAMU aircraft, the helicopter emergency medical services who have been working tirelessly in the recent weeks, stays at almost 100 percent.

Adapting helicopter cabins to protect crews

Airbus Helicopters has mobilized its teams to inform operators of the new and existing solutions for separating the cockpit from the cabin.

“Many EMS operators and militaries are transporting COVID-19 patients while lacking the means to isolate the cockpit from the cabin to protect the crew,” says Stefan Bestle, EMS marketing manager at Airbus Helicopters. “But a solution exists for certain aircraft in the form of cabin cockpit isolation, which provides a barrier between the infected or possibly infected patients and the flight crews, thereby increasing the level of protection.”

The company has already identified and communicated options available in local markets for the H135/H145 as well as the AS332/H225 fleet. Additional solutions for AS365/H155/H175 are under final approval and will be included in the next days. Solutions for the intermediate single engine helicopters are currently under exploration. It has also communicated technical information concerning the ventilation, heating and air conditioning systems on Airbus helicopters. (Information Notice 3492-I-25 accessible via AirbusWorld or T.I.P.I.)

In addition, Airbus Helicopters has issued guidance about how to properly clean and disinfect helicopters, workspaces and tools that have been contaminated by COVID-19, including processes to be followed and disinfection material to be used. (Information Notice 3476-I-12 accessible via AirbusWorld or T.I.P.I.)

And on the newly launched online Marketplace, part of the AirbusWorld collaborative customer portal, customers in Europe and the United States can now purchase aircraft disinfectant solutions from a number of suppliers.

Training from the comfort of home

Physical distancing measures have put a temporary freeze on traditional classroom training courses, troubling customers with urgent training needs. Airbus Helicopters is addressing this gap by recommending distance learning for theoretical training courses. Both pilot and technician trainings can now be performed via online courses, as long as practical tasks are not concerned.

“These remote courses replace classroom trainings and are adapted to a virtual environment with specific software, a different pedagogical approach, and dedicated instructor training,” said Sabrina Barbera, Head of Training at Airbus Helicopters.

Keeping military and governmental helicopter operators in the air

Military and para-public operators worldwide have found themselves on the front lines, often transporting critical patients to hospitals.

To support NH90 operators worldwide, such as the French and Spanish armies, Italian Navy, but also the Australian Ministry of Defence, and the Royal Air Force of Oman, the NH90 Program support office has mobilized, together with NHI and its partner companies Leonardo and Fokker, to ensure the delivery of spare parts, faster turnaround times for repairs, the development and deployment of new solutions such cabin isolation or disinfection among other measures, to ensure the customers can perform their life-saving missions as planned.

And to supplement Airbus Helicopters staff already working on customer bases like in Sweden, Australia, New Zealand and Finland, the company is dispatching teams to perform aircraft and/or component repairs at customer premises in order to prevent AOGs and increase reactivity and responsiveness. In these challenging times, it is of utmost importance that the customer receive the right level of support and immediate answers to their technical concerns all around the world.

Extra support for the Military Support Centre in France

The team at the Military Support Centre in France (MSCF) has been supporting the French armed forces and the French Ministry of Interior by providing the means to fulfill their critical missions, ranging from EMS and public services to logistics flights.

The MSCF was one of the first areas to restart production activities after a four-day pause mid-March that allowed Airbus Helicopters to implement the most stringent health and safety measures to protect the employees. The teams at MSCF even created their own protection visors, an initiative that has since been implemented in other production zones at the Marignane site.

“The French armed forces have been on the front line from the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, performing critical missions such as transporting COVID-19 patients to other hospitals for treatment. Helicopters have played an essential role in these missions, and we, at the Military Support Centre in France, are here to support them,” said Olivier Tillier, Head of the Military Support Centre in France. “This includes responding to urgent demands to deliver spare parts, and finishing up scheduled maintenance work to deliver helicopters faster. Our slogan is “Supporting those who protect us” and this rings so true in today’s situation.”

Of note, the MSCF has been assisting the French armed forces with “Operation Résilience” with tasks ranging from dispatching equipment and supplies to disinfect their helicopters, extending scheduled maintenance tasks, adapting spare parts deliveries, maintaining personnel at the bases, and finalizing maintenance or retrofit work to enable Cougars, EC145s, Caracals, Pumas, and NH90s to be put back into flight or to continue flying.

They have also investigated technical solutions for the installation of electrical converters to power ventilators during the evacuation of COVID-19 patients. Another notable example was providing the necessary equipment kit in record time for mooring the Sécurité Civile’s EC145 on the Dixmude, a French helicopter carrier. The team also provided spare parts that will be needed for operations once the Dixmude reaches its destination in the Antilles.

Air France-KLM carried a total of around 3.6 million passengers in March, down 56.6 percent from a year earlier. Its load factor – which measures the extent to which an airline's planes are full – also fell by 20.5 points from a year ago.

The airline added it was expecting to suspend more than 90 percent of its planned capacity over the course of April and May, as a result of travel restrictions imposed around the world in a bid to thwart the spread of the coronavirus.

""Beyond May 2020, the group is currently unable to provide insight due to the high level of uncertainty over the duration of the crisis,"" Air France-KLM said in a statement.

The airline added it was continuously monitoring the situation and accordingly evaluating if additional network adjustments would be required.

The French government has pledged to support Air France-KLM.

Earlier this week, French junior transport minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari said a figure of €6 billion ($6.5 billion) in loans to help Air France-KLM was ""not unrealistic”.

Sources have told Reuters that Air France-KLM is in talks with banks to receive up to €6 billion in loans guaranteed by the French and Dutch governments as it braces for a sustained coronavirus shutdown.

The French and Dutch states have a 14 percent stake each in Air France-KLM.

Airbus to cut jetliner production

In the aviation sector, European manufacturer Airbus announced plans on Wednesday to cut jetliner production across the board after the coronavirus epidemic triggered aviation's worst industrial crisis and drastically reduced deliveries to cash-starved airlines.

In its largest-ever production adjustment, Airbus said it was reducing output of its best-selling A320 narrow-body family by a third to 40 aircraft a month.

It also cut production of larger wide-body jets with the A350 falling by about 40 percent to six aircraft a month, and the A330 family down by more than 40 percent to two aircraft a month, based on the most recently published Airbus production figures.

Announcing a parallel slowdown in new investments, chief executive Guillaume Faury said the cuts reflected the ""new realities"" of airlines, whose industry association warned this week of the loss of 25 million jobs dependent on air transport.

“We have no short-term cancellations in front of us, but we have a lot of requests for postponements and deferrals ... for 2020 and sometimes 2021,"" Faury told reporters. ""That’s why we are decreasing our production rates.”

The move, which Airbus said represented an average output reduction of a third, came as data showed that March deliveries had halved to 36 jets.

Reuters reported last week that Boeing's European rival was considering sharp cuts in all models in the face of plunging demand, cash problems at airline customers and logistical difficulties in delivering aircraft.

Airbus has experienced particular disruption since France and Spain – two of its host nations alongside Britain and Germany – put their populations in lockdown last month. Since then, it has delivered just six aircraft. Total first-quarter deliveries fell 25 percent to 122.

Airbus produced a further 60 jets that it was unable to deliver because of the crisis, which has forced many airlines to seek postponements and prevented others from sending teams.

In some cases, sources say Airbus has hired private jets to fly in customer pilots as commercial flights dwindled.

(Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg News)

[Ensure you have all the info you need in these unprecedented times. Subscribe now.]

Airbus SE is pausing production at two German sites and its factory in Alabama to adjust to a demand slowdown and supply issues related to the coronavirus pandemic.

The company said in a statement April 6 that it halted production at its German plants in Bremen and Stade for parts of April, while activity at the Mobile, Ala., facility where the A220 and A320 aircraft are made will stop at least through April 29.

The decision comes in response to the pandemic, which has led to high inventory levels and impacted production flow as sites seek to follow government requirements. The move is the latest among a series of isolated measures the European plane maker has taken since the spread of the virus began. It has held off on instituting an official cut in production.

Airbus told its employees in a letter April 3 that a return to full operations isn’t feasible in the short term because of parts shortages and the inability of struggling airlines to take delivery of new aircraft, according to people familiar with the matter. The European plane maker also asked workers in France to take 10 days of vacation between now and mid-May, so it can meet demand once business resumes while a similar move was being discussed in Germany, the people said.

Activities in Bremen will be paused from April 6 until April 27, while Stade began its standstill April 5, and it will last to April 11, with some additional pause days in the weeks that follow in selected areas. Key business-support services will remain active at both sites and will follow social distancing measures, the company said.

The Mobile, Ala., production line will be paused from this week until April 29. With Canadian activity also on hold, both assembly lines for the A220 are offline.

Airbus previously paused production and assembly work in France and Spain for four days to implement health and safety measures, with activity there resuming gradually after March 23. Commercial aircraft wing production operations in the U.K. and commercial aircraft production activities in Spain and Canada remain on pause to reflect stock levels and government restrictions.

Airbus' mobile app-based helicopter ride-hailing subsidiary is no more.

After four years of operations, Voom closed its doors on March 23 with CEO Clement Monnet citing the COVID-19 virus as the primary cause of its demise. The Airbus-incubated and backed startup was one of the first forays into urban air mobility for the European aircraft manufacturer, which has a sizeable helicopter division.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""On March 23, we were forced to cease global operations due to the virus, and today, with our Airbus leadership, we have made the tough call that Voom will not resume its operations,"" Monnet said in a blog post on Airbus' website.

Voom successfully brought app-based ride-hailing to the skies by offering on-demand helicopter service in three major cities that could be booked from a mobile phone. Before its ultimate collapse, Voom had seen operations in the San Francisco, Mexico City, and São Paulo areas, acting as a booking platform that connected travelers with existing helicopter companies in each region.

Though the business will be no more, Monnet and Airbus say that they've proved urban air mobility to be viable and the latter will continue to invest in making robust intra-city networks viable using helicopters and future vertical take-off and land aircraft.

Airbus reduces jet production to cope with coronavirus crisis - The Guardian,"Wed, 08 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIwL2Fwci8wOC9haXJidXMtcmVkdWNlcy1qZXQtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy1jcmlzaXPSAWFodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMC9hcHIvMDgvYWlyYnVzLXJlZHVjZXMtamV0LXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tY29yb25hdmlydXMtY3Jpc2lz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is to slash the number of planes it builds by a third, amid expectations that the coronavirus pandemic will continue wreaking havoc on global aviation long after travel restrictions are eased.

The aircraft manufacturer usually produces more than 60 of its bestselling Airbus A320 every month at assembly lines in Toulouse and Hamburg, but said it would reduce that to 40. It will also cut A330 output to two a month and A350s to a rate of six.

“The impact of this pandemic is unprecedented,” said the chief executive, Guillaume Faury. “At Airbus, protecting our people and supporting the fight against the virus are our chief priorities at this time.

“Our airline customers are heavily impacted by the Covid-19 crisis. We are actively adapting our production to their new situation and working on operational and financial mitigation measures to face reality.”

The decision, which comes days after its biggest rival, Boeing, shut several US plants, could have a significant knock-on effect on Airbus staff and suppliers around the world, including in the UK.

The company has 13,500 UK workers, most of whom make wings at its two key sites in Broughton, north Wales, and Filton, Bristol. Airbus also supports about 2,500 firms in its supply chain.

The Franco-German company did not initially say whether it expected to lay off staff or put them on a furlough scheme.

Airbus and Boeing are by far the largest suppliers of planes to commercial airlines, which have been hit hard by the pandemic, triggering requests for government bailouts.

4:00 How the coronavirus changed what we worry about – video

John Strickland, the director of the independent transport consultancy JLS Consulting, said aircraft manufacturers were bracing for a severe and long-lasting impact.

He said the effect on the industry was expected to be more significant than 9/11, the 2008 economic crisis or the volcanic ash cloud that led to the cancellation of flights over much of Europe in 2010.

“All of those were far more localised and, though they looked bad at the time, they had boundaries. This is global. It’s of a much greater magnitude and is provoking an economic slowdown. It’s all of the worst things put together.

“It’s really going to be long lasting. First of all we have the uncertainty of when airlines can get flying again, which they cannot do until countries lift border restrictions.

“Nor will they suddenly fly everything as normal if bookings aren’t there, which they might not be if people are fearful of travelling and catching the virus. Some destinations may be unwilling to accept tourists or will at least temporarily lose their traditional popularity.”

Strickland said leisure travel could be impacted by people losing their jobs, with business travel also affected by bankruptcies in the private sector and a switch to video conferencing. The enforcement of physical distancing on flights could also result in fewer seat sales, he said.

The aviation sector would probably to emerge significantly smaller, Strickland said, in turn reducing demand for aircraft made by the large manufacturers Airbus and Boeing.

“Not all airlines will come back from this and those that do are likely to do so with reduced capacity. Any combination of these elements could last for years.”"

An Airbus flight test crew has just completed its latest mission with an A350-1000 test aircraft. This is the third of such missions between Europe and China. The aircraft returned to France with a cargo of 4 million face masks on Sunday 5 April.

The A350-1000 left Toulouse, France, on Friday 3 April, reaching the Airbus site in Tianjin, China on 4 April and returning to Hamburg the same day.

Since mid-March, the previous two missions were performed by an A330-800, an A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT). Airbus also deployed an A400M and its Beluga fleet to transport shipments of masks between its European sites, in France, Germany, the UK and Spain.

Airbus will continue to support the fight against the Coronavirus pandemic wherever possible.

""I would like to pay tribute to all the Airbus teams, globally, supporting the fight against COVID-19. They're living our values in assisting those who are saving lives every day”, said Guillaume Faury, Airbus CEO. ""

Airbus is focused on the health and safety of its employees and supporting its customers and the industry eco-system with business continuity. At the same time Airbus is contributing to many vital public and private services and working with partners who rely on aircraft, helicopters, space and security solutions to carry out life-saving missions in support of the global pandemic.

Airbus is deploying its employees, their expertise and know-how and leveraging technology in this fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, for example in designing and manufacturing ventilators and 3D printed visors which are critical resources for hospitals.

The Company is partnering with other organisations in unprecedented ways to achieve this goal as fast as possible."

In Q1 2020, Airbus booked 290 net commercial aircraft orders and delivered 122 aircraft. A further 60 aircraft were produced during the quarter, however they remain undelivered due to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic.

36 aircraft were delivered in March across the different aircraft families, down from 55 in February 2020. This reflects customer requests to defer deliveries, as well as other factors related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This include Turkish Airlines new A350.

The new average production rates going forward have been set as follows:

40 A320 family per month

2 A330 per month

6 A350 per month

This represents a reduction of the pre-coronavirus average rates of roughly one third.

“The impact of this pandemic is unprecedented...Our airline customers are heavily impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. We are actively adapting our production to their new situation and working on operational and financial mitigation measures to face reality.” Airbus Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury

Cancellation And Deferred Orders

Kuwait Airways

Five A350-900s, ordered by Kuwait Airways, have been removed from the backlog, although these aircraft had already been due for cancellation after the airline signed for A330-800neos.

"Airbus Mulls 'Smaller Scale' Rate Changes, May Not Need State Aid - Aviation Week","Wed, 29 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcmNyYWZ0LXByb3B1bHNpb24vYWlyYnVzLW11bGxzLXNtYWxsZXItc2NhbGUtcmF0ZS1jaGFuZ2VzLW1heS1ub3QtbmVlZC1zdGF0ZS1haWTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FRANKFURT—Airbus will not decide on further changes to its production rates before June and any potential adaptations will be “on a smaller scale” than previous cuts, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said April 29.

Airbus plans to spend the next few weeks on a deep dive into the plans and financial performance of its customers, both lessors and airlines. The OEM wants to better assess what both their short-term behaviour and long-term strategies will look like. Faury said the analysis will be “very granular.” Airbus is also trying to assess what the recovery in traffic will look like and is adapting its financial planning accordingly.

Importantly, the company’s CFO Dominik Asam believes that “if we are able to do what we plan, [government aid] should not be necessary, given that at the beginning of April we had about €30 billion ($32.5 billion) in liquidity resources, which should be ample funding under the circumstances I’ve described.”

The company decided April 8 to reduce output across its product line by around one third. Airbus plans to build 40 narrowbodies a month—down from more than 60—as well as two A330/A330neos and six A350s per month. Analysts have suggested that Airbus will have to make further cuts of a similar size as customers continue to defer deliveries.

Faury believes that deliveries will be “very low” in the second quarter after the manufacturer was able to hand over 122 aircraft in the first quarter, which was only partially affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Nonetheless, Airbus was unable to deliver 60 completed aircraft in Q1.

“After the summer we will start delivering aircraft at a better pace,” he said. Faury believes that the number of undelivered completed aircraft will peak in the third quarter. “But the picture is very dynamic,” he cautioned.

While the short-term focus is on cash conservation and cutting rates, Faury also wants to position Airbus in a way that enables it to resume growth quickly. “The race will start again, we want to be fast and agile. There is a threat to be stuck in the crisis and not be able to compete again.” Faury believes that the single-aisle market will recover faster than the widebodies but the pace of the recovery and the timing “are very difficult to predict.” He indicated that there could be “a very aggressive ramp up in single aisle production” after the COVID-19 crisis. The A321XLR development program will continued “at good speed.”

In discussions with airlines, Faury has observed there is more of a preference for smaller aircraft compared to pre-coronavirus planning. He argues that Airbus is well positioned in this regard, particularly with the A220 as its smallest narrowbody, and with the A321XLR taking on some former widebody missions.

Faury expects widebody demand to recover between 2023 and 2025, while the outlook for narrowbodies is “not that gloomy.” Therefore, Airbus is also trying to preserve its ability to go back to previous production volumes quickly once the demand justifies it. Investment in new facilities such as the additional single-aisle final assembly line in Toulouse will only be made once it is clear that there is demand to go beyond 60 aircraft per month.

Given the accumulated problems Boeing is facing because of the coronavirus and the MAX grounding, Faury argues that Airbus’ “capacity to compete is improved. Our product range is the right one.”

He also considers the crisis as “potentially an opportunity to accelerate fleet modernization.” He described the collapse of the planned commercial aircraft joint venture between Boeing and Embraer as “collateral damage [of the crisis] for the competition” and “positive for us.”

Faury made clear that while Airbus “cannot focus short-term on decarbonization,” it will come back “big time and Airbus intends to be a leader. This has not changed.”

He said that while some projects had stopped they were “very few” in number. The most prominent cancellation has been the E-Fan X project with Rolls-Royce, announced April 24. Most of the learnings in the project have been generated before flight and flying it would have been “very expensive,” Faury said.

Airbus reported a €481 million net loss for the first quarter on sales of €10.6 billion. That compares to a €40 million net profit on €12.5 billion in sales a year earlier. The adjusted operating profit was down 49% at €281 million. Free cash flow was a negative €8 billion in the quarter—almost twice the amount in the first quarter of 2019—as Airbus had to store 60 undelivered aircraft as inventory and as €3.6 billion in settlements for the bribery scandal were paid."
A fond farewell to five fantastic fleets - American Airlines Newsroom,"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hYS5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXdzLWRldGFpbHMvMjAyMC9BLWZvbmQtZmFyZXdlbGwtdG8tZml2ZS1mYW50YXN0aWMtZmxlZXRzLUZMVC0wNC9kZWZhdWx0LmFzcHjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FORT WORTH, Texas — Last month, American Airlines announced plans to accelerate the retirement of some older, less fuel-efficient aircraft from its fleet sooner than originally planned. As flying schedules and aircraft needs are fine-tuned during this period of record low demand, American will take the unique step of retiring a total of five aircraft types.

American has officially retired the Embraer E190 and Boeing 767 fleets, which were originally scheduled to retire by the end of 2020. The airline has also accelerated the retirement of its Boeing 757s and Airbus A330-300s. Additionally, American has retired 15 Bombardier CRJ200 aircraft operated by PSA Airlines.

These changes remove operating complexity and will bring forward cost savings and efficiencies associated with operating fewer aircraft types. It will also help American focus on flying more advanced aircraft as we continue receiving new deliveries of the Airbus A321neo and the Boeing 737 MAX and 787 family. American's narrowbody fleet also becomes more simplified with just two cockpit types – the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737 families. This benefits American's operational performance through training efficiency and streamlined maintenance.

American continues to evaluate its schedule and remains committed to caring for customers on life's journey. These changes will help American continue to provide a reliable travel experience around the world, even during these uncertain times.

Here's a snapshot of the aircraft that have exited American's fleet:

Airbus employees in Spain are working around the clock to make visor frames for protective face masks using innovative 3D printing technology. This activity complements Airbus’ series of transport flights from China – carrying millions of face masks to Europe for supply to hospitals and health-care workers.

More than 20 printers across Airbus sites in Getafe, Illescas, Albacete and Seville – supplemented by employees’ own personal machines – have been working non-stop for weeks. Together, Spanish employees from all sites are producing 300 visor frames a day, with thousands already being donated.

It only takes a few hours to go from designing to printing, but then with 3D printing serial production is slow. If 300 people all do it at the same time, we can make enough pieces.

- Pedro Lozano from Airbus’ Albacete, Spain facility

Every afternoon, the produced hardware is collected and distributed to local Spanish hospitals by those with special government mobility authorisation during the lockdown.

Airbus in Germany also is supporting the Spanish initiatives: ProtoSpace Germany, the Composite Technology Centre (CTC) in Stade, and the “Mobility Goes Additive” 3D printing network” are all producing visor frames for the virus-impacted Madrid region. And in France, Airbus’ Survey Copter tactical drone division is making visors for use by Spanish medical staff.

Taking action as a community

3D printing technology also is at the heart of COVID-19 support activities from employees at Airbus’ Wichita, Kansas Engineering Centre in the U.S. – which normally focusses on wing design for the company’s long-range aircraft.

Working remotely, these team members are helping 3D-print headbands for a crowdsourced protective face shield design from Prusa Research – which also consists of a polycarbonate shield and elastic strap.

Community members and businesses have been providing parts for the face shield, while several people from Airbus’ Wichita facility perform quality control and final assembly duties. Completed face shields are delivered to the Wichita Police Department and Sedgwick County Sheriff’s Department for distribution where they are needed.

Working remotely, Airbus’ Wichita employees already have provided more than 300 units.

Meeting the challenge for ventilators

In the UK, Airbus and its employees are answering the government’s urgent call for medical ventilators as part of the VentilatorChallengeUK Consortium. The UK’s National Health Service (NHS) currently has access to approximately 8,000 ventilators, however it is expected to need up to 30,000 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

With an urgent order for over 10,000 ventilators to fulfil, the consortium – which also includes BAE Systems, Ford, GKN, Rolls-Royce, Siemens and Thales – is working at full speed to define its product and ramp up production.

The consortium considered a range of options for its rapidly-manufactured ventilator system, developed by clinicians in conjunction with the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. It is now moving ahead rapidly on production of two agreed designs, which are based on existing technologies and can be assembled from materials and parts currently in production.

Airbus has a crucial role to play in the fight against COVID-19. Our engineers and technology teams are working flat out to respond to the challenge, and I'm proud to be a part of it.

- Martin Bolton, of Airbus’ Broughton facility in the UK

As the COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented threat to daily life, Airbus’ employees in France are working on “outside the box” ways to fight against the virus’ continued spread.

On 30 and 31 March, Airbus’ Humanity Lab organised a remote “hackathon” where over 200 participating employees considered, designed and quickly prototyped new solutions with a focus on helping medical staff and services, as well as protecting those affected by the crisis.

From the total of 116 ideas considered, 30 projects were launched, including a doorknob catch to avoid touching door handles. Manufacturing medical equipment such as filters for ventilators, masks, visors and glasses also were considered, as was a system for recycling masks."
"DB Schenker, Airbus innovations maximize cargo space in passenger jets - FreightWaves","Thu, 30 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWlnaHR3YXZlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9kYi1zY2hlbmtlci1haXJidXMtaW5ub3ZhdGlvbnMtbWF4aW1pemUtY2FyZ28tc3BhY2UtaW4tcGFzc2VuZ2VyLWpldHPSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVpZ2h0d2F2ZXMuY29tL25ld3MvZGItc2NoZW5rZXItYWlyYnVzLWlubm92YXRpb25zLW1heGltaXplLWNhcmdvLXNwYWNlLWluLXBhc3Nlbmdlci1qZXRzL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Logistics and aviation companies are proving extremely resourceful developing ways to add cargo capacity to an air transport system experiencing severe bottlenecks due to the shortage of freight-capable aircraft.

On Thursday, Germany logistics group DB Schenker announced it has created a virtual airline in partnership with Icelandair to shuttle medical supplies to Europe and the U.S. on passenger planes with seats removed. And giant aircraft manufacturer Airbus said it also has developed a system to maximize cabin space for cargo.

Schenker, the contract logistics and forwarding arm of German railroad operator Deutsche Bahn, said it has chartered three Boeing 767 passenger jets from Icelandair to operate daily flights from Shanghai to Munich with medical equipment for importers involved in subduing the COVID-19 outbreak. The China shuttle will be able to deliver personal protective equipment, such as surgical gowns, within five to seven days of booking.

Once fully operational, DB Schenker’s private airline will perform 45 initial shuttle flights in 12 rotations per week. DB Schenker, the third-largest global logistics provider by gross revenue, said it will expand the charter operation beyond the initial number of flights and is planning a twice-weekly service to Chicago too.

In the real world some need to be parked or stored for short, or even long periods of time.

Special COVID-19 update

Customer Services teams are working hard to adapt maintenance recommendations and support customers who have fleets partially or wholly grounded during this period.

The situation calls for exceptional measures and reactivity to provide pragmatic support to operators during this difficult period, while keeping the highest levels of safety.“Never in the history of aviation have airlines had to ground so many aircraft, so quickly. They need help to reduce the huge and sudden maintenance workload, and to ensure a quick return to service when required,” explains Gilles de Cevins, head of maintenance programmes and services.

In addition to increasing its support teams and giving recommendations to customers, Airbus is providing technical justifications and solutions for maintenance burden reduction. This includes extending calendar intervals for scheduled maintenance tasks and reducing the frequency of periodic ground checks from every week to every two weeks.

Airbus has published technical data via Operators Information Transmissions (OITs). Technical queries about these should be addressed to Airbus Customer Services through the TechRequest tool on AirbusWorld, selecting the Scheduled Maintenance domain and the Parking & Storage topic.

Parking and storage - what’s the difference?

‘Parking’ usually means the aircraft is taken out of operation for up to six months. Sometimes longer spells of parking mean coming out of a flight-ready condition, but it is more usual to carry out the regular light maintenance needed to preserve a ‘ready to go’ state which allows a rapid return to service. Every week over 100 aircraft are parked for periods which exceed 14 days.

‘Storage’ generally applies when a rapid or unexpected return to service is unlikely and the planned period out of service is up to two years. In these cases airworthiness can be maintained but more preferable is a reduced maintenance schedule combined with preservation activities, such as sealing and greasing.

Why store an aircraft that could be earning?

Aircraft are sometimes referred to as ‘revenue generators’. It is common for them to enter commercial service within days of delivery to operators and a key aim of fleet planning is to safely maximise the time each aircraft spends in the air carrying passengers or freight. Parking or storing an aircraft is an expensive option but there are sometimes compelling reasons to do so.

Time away from operations, such as when waiting for maintenance activities, isn’t unusual and some operators have business models which include being less busy at particular times of year. Offering holiday-related travel to regions where a seasonal climate is part of the destinations’ appeal might mean anticipating a regular ‘down-season’. Reducing flight frequency or closing some routes and then parking or storing part of the fleet makes better financial sense than flying aircraft with too many empty seats. Aircraft are also sometimes taken out of service while awaiting return to the leasing company that owns them. Getting all the relevant dates and activities involved to coincide perfectly can be difficult so a short period of parking can be a practical solution.

However, unplanned events can also create a need for parking or storage, usually in circumstances where the operator has little choice but still needs to protect their asset. These can range from technical issues which can’t be resolved quickly to an aircraft being grounded by the authorities while a long way from its base. Financial issues can also create a need for storage, such as bankruptcy, outstanding fuel bills, lack of ground and cabin staff or pilots, and abandonment of aircraft owned by lessors.

Regional or global crises can lead to a complete or partial collapse in the usual infrastructure needed to support aviation. Humanitarian disasters, widespread health or sanitary problems, extreme economic or political events; whatever the reason, parking or storage might be the only viable option available to aircraft operators caught in the middle of such events.

Why protection is key

Once an aircraft is out of service the likelihood of issues caused by the wear and tear of routine flying is reduced. Nevertheless, without proper protection a host of new threats to the condition of the aircraft can emerge depending on the climate and conditions the aircraft is stored in. Weather can cause problems. If rain, snow, salty air, dust or sand enter air ducts, they can degrade or contaminate the mechanical parts they come into contact with. Extremely high winds can also cause damage to an aircraft that might be considered safe and stable in normal circumstances. High humidity, lightning strikes and volcanic ash also require special consideration.

Protection against unwelcome ‘passengers’ is also vital. It only takes weeks for rodents, birds and insects to cause serious damage to a previously pristine cabin with seats, carpets and wiring all vulnerable particularly if a nest is established. Returning to service without an expensive and time-consuming deep-clean and repair operation is unthinkable. In extreme cases, infestation can also lead to blocked ducts, some of which could have safety repercussions – again thorough checks and remedial actions take time so avoiding the problem is the best solution.

Help! - Requests from around the world

A wide variety of natural phenomena can threaten stored or parked aircraft. Customer Services teams are often asked for advice on dealing with potential issues, some of which have a distinct regional flavour.

Caribbean:

Salty and humid conditions require extra protection.

Middle East:

With up to 80 million locusts in the central area of a swarm the need for extra caution is clear. Moving aircraft into hangars and sealing ducts and potential entry points is crucial.

Siberia:

In winter, temperatures can reach below 40°C. In ‘deep freeze’ cold of this nature, some plastic and rubber derived parts can become brittle so care is needed.

Asia and Northern Europe:

Heavy rain and high humidity can cause mildew inside the aircraft. Without careful sealing, extreme water levels can even cause cabin flooding leading to litres of water pouring out at the end of the storage period. However, sealing must be done correctly to ensure that evaporation is still possible, thus preventing mould.

Japan:

AMM (Aircraft Maintenance Manual) procedures cover mooring of aircraft in winds up to 75 knots. Severe typhoons have winds of at least 80 knots while super typhoons are defined by winds of at least 100 knots. Advice varies according to specific circumstances but it can include moving aircraft into hangars - or out of them if the buildings themselves are at risk. Filling fuel tanks can add extra weight to the aircraft while removing plastic sheeting prevents it from catching the wind and becoming a ‘sail’ which drags the aircraft.

Overall it is fair to say that, depending on location and on seasonal and operational conditions, the exact procedures for storage or parking vary. However, protecting the aircraft against contamination, mechanical degradation or damage is always essential.

Aircraft should be parked or stored in clean and serviceable condition. Measures should be taken to clean the cabin, galleys and cargo, service all the systems, protect the exposed areas, and carry out the periodical checks. Anticipation is also vital. Use experience and knowledge of the environment as a guide, to take appropriate actions for cold weather, ventilation, mooring, and ensuring that sufficient fuel is in the tanks for water draining or APU (auxiliary power unit) operation and engine runs.

AMM or Maintenance Procedure tasks exist to prepare an aircraft for parking/storage and return it to service and these should always be followed.

Asking the right questions

When deciding whether to park or store an aircraft, you should check requirements carefully. An out-of-operation aircraft can be maintained with an approved maintenance programme. Consult the AMM to find procedures and check which are mandatory.

Seven frequently asked questions:

ISI 10.00.00003 GUIDELINES FOR APPROPRIATE ACTIONS

Is it necessary to park or store an aircraft before a scheduled maintenance check, working party or cabin refurbishing?

Check the guidelines regarding your specific circumstances.

ISI 10.00.00004 PARKING or STORAGE EXTENSION

What can I do when the parking or storage period has expired?

Normally after two years an aircraft must return to operation before going back into storage. This should become a deviation in the future and there will be no need to re-fly if the aircraft is not required by the operator.

ISI 10.00.00005 AIRCRAFT SYSTEM INTEGRITY

Is it possible to remove parts from an aircraft that is parked or stored?

Parked aircraft should be flight ready – batteries can be removed to preserve them as they can be quickly reinstalled. Other items can be removed in specific conditions, for example some of the fire extinguishers in the cabin aren’t necessary for a flight without passengers. However, removing parts for parking is highly restricted.

In stored aircraft, it is more common for major components to be removed. Engines, APUs, flaps and computers all have high value and can be transferred to in-service aircraft. The best solutions often depend on the planned storage time. Operators have some flexibility and should check with Airbus if in doubt. It can become a costly process if an aircraft needs to return to service when major parts have been removed, so operators should be clear about the storage mode and duration before making decisions.

ISI 10.00.00006 SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE CONTROL

What is the starting date to be used to calculate future ground checks?

All dates must be calculated based on the last flight date. This rule applies even if an aircraft is initially parked then moves to storage, or if it needs two months of maintenance then is parked.

ISI 10.00.00007 TASKS CALENDAR

How does a parking or storage period influence the scheduled maintenance?

Scheduled or planned maintenance must still be done, but may be postponed until the end of a parking/storage period if operators have agreement from their local authority. If an aircraft is in short-term parking mode, it is advisable to do scheduled maintenance when due, to avoid delays on return-to-service.

ISI 10.00.00008 ENGINES & APU ON WING

Who shall I ask questions to related to engines and APU?

Operators need to refer directly to the engine and APU manufacturers in line with legal requirements.

ISI 10.00.00009 ASSISTANCE and ISI 10.00.00010 COVER DEVIATIONS

How can Airbus support me regarding aircraft parking and storage?

Operators can log a request in the Airbus TechRequest too, for advice, deviation options, and overdue maintenance where aircraft needs to be flown to a specific maintenance base or to new owner.

Operators who supply full and accurate information to Airbus can be supported with documents confirming that procedures have been followed – these can be a requirement for airworthiness authorities.

Support and responsibilities

Airbus deals with several requests for support every day and offers advice as well services. It can evaluate specific situations to help ensure the safety and serviceability required for an easy return-to-service. Operators are responsible for ensuring correct and complete information for Airbus when preparing validation from their authorities.

As for any maintenance actions, parking and storage have to be approached like a planned maintenance check. All the regulations and standard practices apply. Preparation, traceability and proper execution of the maintenance tasks are essential for a safe and uncomplicated release back into service.

Keeping the AMM current

By reporting back to Airbus, operators can help keep the AMM up-to-date in the light of experience and evolving techniques. This happened, for example, when operators explained that the aluminium covers being used to prevent fabric fading inside the cabin were actually causing paint discoloration around the windows. A new technique was then developed to resolve this issue.

Scheduled Maintenance seminars

These include some information on critical situations for parking and storing, aircraft waiting for dismantling, or needing leasing company acceptance for flight, aircraft on standby and more

sched-maint.seminar@airbus.com

Back to service

To return an aircraft to service all the required maintenance must be carried out. This includes all scheduled maintenance, daily and weekly servicing when needed, and the restoration of any defects which may have arisen during the period of storage or parking. Everything required to bring the aircraft back to operational standards and ensure safe use is essential. Calendar items as well as mandatory items, Airworthiness Directives, All Operator Telex, shelf-life equipment, and inspections due must be included. Upon release into service the aircraft must be fully airworthy in every respect.

Conclusion

Whatever the circumstances, when parking or storage is the right solution for an aircraft it is wise to prepare in advance and strongly advisable to refer to the latest recommendations and guidelines in

the AMM, in-service information and technical follow-up documents.

Making full use of Airbus support as early as possible to evaluate specific needs, avoid unplanned deviations and anticipate costs will also help. Keeping delays and costs down means thinking through storage rental but also planning maintenance to avoid overdue work causing a backlog which ultimately delays return-to-service.

The most crucial piece of advice is to get in touch early. This helps all parties and allows the best possible experience of a potentially complicated situation. Poorly planned and handled storage or parking can lead to aircraft being prevented from returning to operation when required and the consequences for revenues can be serious."
Coronavirus Has Popped the Boeing and Airbus Bubble - Yahoo Finance,"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy1wb3BwZWQtYm9laW5nLWFpcmJ1cy1idWJibGUtMDAwMDA1MTcxLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s not just air tickets that are being canceled as the coronavirus causes global travel to seize up. Purchases of aircraft are also being pulled.

Aircraft lessors Avolon Holdings Ltd., China Development Bank Financial Leasing Co., and General Electric Co.’s GECAS have rescinded orders for 173 Boeing Co. 737 MAX aircraft over the past month, worth $17.8 billion at list prices. Airbus is cutting output of planes by a third, while Boeing will reduce production of 787 Dreamliners by half, people familiar with the plans told Julie Johnsson and Siddharth Philip of Bloomberg News.

There’s likely to be more to come. The global aviation industry is being hollowed out by the prospect of international and domestic travel grinding mostly to a halt for 18 months or so: The International Air Transport Association expects traffic to decline by 48% this year because of the coronavirus.

One of the first places airlines will look to make savings will be in their multi-billion dollar capital expenditure budgets — in other words, in the plane manufacturers’ revenue. Even that won’t be enough to save many carriers without extraordinary support.

By far the biggest slice of revenue for Airbus and Boeing is the single-aisle jets like the 737 and A320 used primarily by budget carriers. Discount airlines are probably the ones least likely to get bailouts from governments, which often own stakes in competing, and ailing, flag-carriers. Without the extraordinarily large orders for such aircraft entered in recent years by the likes of PT Lion Mentari Airlines, AirAsia Group Bhd., InterGlobe Aviation Ltd., EasyJet Plc, Vietjet Aviation JSC, Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, and Flydubai, manufacturers’ order books would be looking worryingly empty.

Boeing and Airbus have tended to shrug off the risk of one of these customers going belly-up. That’s because the multi-decade project to design and build a new aircraft isn’t driven so much by a poll of airlines, as models of where the entire aviation industry is heading.

Story continues

Both aerospace manufacturers put out annual 20-year market forecasts, shaped by deep macroeconomic factors such as GDP growth, people’s propensity to travel as incomes rise, and urban population changes. For such long-range predictions, these surveys often do remarkably well. Boeing’s 2000 outlook estimated that global traffic in 2019 would amount to 8.06 trillion revenue passenger-kilometers; in 2018, the actual number was 8.16 trillion RPKs.(1)

That impressive track record has led to hubris. If you believe air travel demand has a mathematical relationship to economic growth and airline services will be made available wherever potential demand exists, then there’s no reason to worry if an airline with hundreds of planes on order goes out of business. The invisible hand will conjure up another carrier to take its place, or the orders will be shifted to some other part of the world.

Dig into the detail, though, and the outlooks are often no more accurate than you'd expect a 20-year forecast to be. Boeing in 2000 expected that the top three “domestic” markets of North America, Europe, and China would account for about a third of global traffic growth over the coming two decades. In fact, they’ve made up almost three-quarters of the increase.

Those forecasting errors were most dramatic in relation to fleet growth. The number of jumbo jets like the Boeing 747 and Airbus A380 currently in passenger service is fewer than were flying back in 1999, and roughly half the 1,184 Boeing predicted back in 2000. Small regional jets have also fallen from favor as the A320 and 737 have swallowed up more than two-thirds of the market. The failure of heavy twin-aisle jets like the A340 and A380 is hard to separate from the expectation two decades ago that they were a growth market.

What current predictions might turn out badly? One area is the assumption that demand for air travel keeps going up at a fairly constant rate in relation to GDP growth, even as economies become wealthy. That view was questionable at the best of times — even rich people don’t like to spend every waking hour on long-haul flights. It looks even more so in a world where the long shadow of Covid-19 will cause people to take their leisure closer to home, and where quarantine barriers could be in place for some time.

Business travel, the financial backbone of full-service carriers, will also face existential questions as companies assess how their white-collar staff have coped through a global lockdown. Travel tends to increase in tandem with trade; that would suggest weaker prospects, too, in a post-Trump, post-coronavirus era.

These aren’t purely spreadsheet problems. Airbus and Boeing have built their supply chains and balance sheets to support expectations of about 40,000 new aircraft being delivered over the next 20 years.

Aircraft pay off their vast development expense not in the first year, but over the entire time that planes are being manufactured. Almost a decade after its first delivery, the 787 Dreamliner still has more than $20 billion of such costs that must be gradually worked off as more planes are sold.

Right now, it’s the unlimited demand for the A320 and 737 that’s bailing the manufacturers out of the mistakes they made with the A380, A340 and 787. Should that start to stutter, they’re in for problems that — like those forecasts — could last decades.

(1) Revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs are a measure of passenger traffic equivalent to the number of paid-for seats on planes multiplied by the distance they were flown.

On Monday, Boeing [NYSE: BA] announced it will temporarily suspend all operations at its 787 plant in North Charleston, South Carolina. The move comes two weeks after the company paused operations at its plants in Washington state, where Gov. Jay Inslee issued a stay-at-home order in mid-March.



Boeing’s decision in South Carolina coincided with Gov. Henry McMaster’s belated order for people to avoid public contact. After holding out against guidance from public health officials to lockdown the populace to prevent community spread, McMaster finally relented, but his order was watered down compared with most other states because it provides exceptions for all types of work, visiting family and recreating outdoors.

“It is our commitment to focus on the health and safety of our teammates while assessing the spread of the virus across the state, its impact on the reliability of our global supply chain and that ripple effect on the 787 program,” said Brad Zaback, vice president and general manager of the 787 program, in a statement. “We are working in alignment with state and local government officials and public health officials to take actions that best protect our people.”

Airbus announces triple-deck Airbus A380ultra - AeroTime,"Wed, 01 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjQ3NTQtYWlyYnVzLWEzODB1bHRyYS1hbm5vdW5jZW1lbnTSAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZXJvdGltZS5hZXJvL2FydGljbGVzLzI0NzU0LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwdWx0cmEtYW5ub3VuY2VtZW50L2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On February 14, 2019, Airbus broke everyone’s hearts. The company announced that one of the most iconic aircraft of the 21st century would be no more, as the manufacturer would cease production in 2021 due to the lack of demand for the A380. Emirates Airlines, which owns the majority of the Superjumbos ever produced by Airbus, indicated that the size of the double-decker is not ideal to the current state of the market and opted for something more conventional in the form of 30 Airbus A350-900 and 40 Airbus A330-900neo as it replaced previously unfulfilled orders of the A380.

However, on April 1, 2020, Airbus reinstated hope that the A380 is well and alive. The Toulouse, France-based manufacturer announced a new aircraft in its lineup ‒ the Airbus A380ultra. The new aircraft, just like its now-unwanted brother, will be a true giant of the skies. Featuring an extra deck on top of the second deck of the double-decker Airbus A380, the A380ultra would be a triple-deck aircraft.

The one-of-a-kind aircraft will seat up to 1060 passengers or 880 in a typical three-class layout, with first-class passengers enjoying the best view from the third floor, while economy class passengers would be seated on the bottom floor, as they should sit “like the plebeians that they are,” according to the CEOs of European low-cost-carriers, already discussing whether to order the new triple-decker.

Nevertheless, the ingenuity of the aircraft won’t stop there. The Airbus A380ultra is set to have a very flexible configuration, including the fact that the third floor could be converted into such facilities as a movie theater, spa center, shopping mall, restaurant, gym, food court, offices, basketball arena and numerous other configurations that the manufacturer, definitely not the author of the article, was not able to mention.

The Airbus A380ultra would be powered by four General Electric GE9X engines, which were specifically developed for the Boeing 777X. When asked why the GE9X engine was made available for the new A380, the engine-maker, in its best impression of Mr. Krabs, responded with “money.”

During the press announcement, airport representatives from around the world released a collective sigh as the presentation of the A380ultra concluded.

Emirates indicated that it would be the launch customer of the aircraft, making an initial order for 100 of the jets.

The type is set to be introduced in 2023, just a year later when the Dubai-based airline is supposed to start flying Concorde on some of its premium routes from Dubai International Airport (DXB).

While over the past few months the state of the aviation industry has deteriorated into an unprecedented crisis, such occasions as April Fools’ allows the tension to simmer down. After all, laughter heals. The article was not meant to offend or cause harm to anyone."
Airbus Cuts Commercial Aircraft Production By One Third - Aviation Week,"Wed, 08 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcmNyYWZ0LXByb3B1bHNpb24vYWlyYnVzLWN1dHMtY29tbWVyY2lhbC1haXJjcmFmdC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLW9uZS10aGlyZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FRANKFURT—Airbus decided April 8 to cut commercial aircraft production by roughly one third across the board as it deals with the fall-out of the coronavirus crisis.

The aircraft manufacturer plans to produce 40 A320neo family per month on average, down from a previous near-term target of 63. Airbus will also reduce A330/A330neo output to two aircraft per month from the pre-crisis production level of 40 per year. A350 deliveries are reduced from between nine and ten aircraft to just six per month.

Airbus said it “preserves its ability to meet customer demand while protecting its ability to further adapt as the global market evolves.” CEO Guillaume Faury pointed out that it is “not unlikely” that the new rates could go back up in 2021 as the situation improves but that it was too early to make firm commitments. The decisions made now reflect the “best knowledge” today and “many conversations with airline CEOs and COOs.”

“The impact of this pandemic is unprecedented,” Faury said. “We are in constant dialogue with our customers and supply chain partners as we are all going through these difficult times together. Our airline customers are heavily impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. We are actively adapting our production to their new situation and working on operational and financial mitigation measures to face reality.”

Airbus delivered 122 aircraft in the first quarter, 36 of which were in March. They included two A220s, 19 A320neos, one A321ceo, ten A321neos, one A330-200 and three A350s according to the company’s latest orders and deliveries figures. Airbus produced 60 more aircraft that were not delivered in the quarter because of the COVID-19 impact.

The production reduction will be implemented over the coming weeks and Faury believes that “this crisis will probably be a long one. Our industry is one of the most impacted.” The production rates are “the result of the best matching between the downturn and the remaining commitments. We needed to have a plan. We will review it probably on a monthly basis and I don’t know whether it will be modified.” There was still “uncertainty moving forward.”

The A330 will remain a profitable program, Faury said, but the A350 will face “more headwinds” having just moved into profitability in 2019.

According to Faury, the production cuts are to be made across all of its final assembly lines and no single site will be shut down. “It will be a dynamic situation and we will be flexible.” It is “not unlikely that aviation will look different after this crisis.” But having good products makes Faury stay “optimistic.” Efforts for long-term technology such as more electric flying will “slow down, but we will keep investing in the technology of the future.”

Airbus is removing all costs that are not “absolutely necessary” as the business is shrinking significantly. However, development programs such as the A321XLR that Airbus has committed to will not be touched and timelines not changed.

The manufacturer recorded 290 net orders in the first quarter. There were two new orders in March: AerCap bought 25 A320neos and 25 A321neos, and an undisclosed customer ordered ten A350-900s. The first quarter was “unusually strong” in terms of new orders, Faury said. But now “the situation has changed completely” and Airbus expects “a much lower level of orders for the coming months.” There are a lot of requests for deferrals of deliveries in 2020 and even in 2021, Faury said. Therefore, Airbus has decided to not produce them in the first place.

From snorkelling mask to emergency respiratory solution - Airbus,"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTA0LWZyb20tc25vcmtlbGxpbmctbWFzay10by1lbWVyZ2VuY3ktcmVzcGlyYXRvcnktc29sdXRpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Decathlon Easybreath full-face mask is among the most popular snorkelling accessories, enabling users to breathe comfortably underwater without invasive tubes. Today, the Airbus Humanity Lab is developing 3D-printed adaptor prototypes to transform it into a non-invasive ventilation mask for patients, as well as personal protective equipment for healthcare professionals on the front line of the COVID-19 pandemic.

When the Easybreath mask first hit the shelves of French sporting goods retailer Decathlon, it became an instant best-selling hit. And it is not hard to see why: unlike other snorkelling accessories that use mouth tubes for breathing, the Easybreath enables users to breathe comfortably via their nose and mouth thanks to a full-face mask configuration.

Today, this unique design—with the addition of potentially compatible accessories—is showing real promise to provide non-critical respiratory assistance to patients and to help protect healthcare professionals at hospitals across Europe. The Airbus Humanity Lab project team is bringing together industry players to develop 3D-printed adaptor prototypes that could transform the way the Decathlon Easybreath snorkelling mask is used during a health crisis.

One mask, two innovative applications

The idea to use the Easybreath for medical purposes first gained traction in Italy, after medical equipment shortages forced doctors to improvise respiratory assistance solutions. Thanks to ad-hoc adaptors, the full-face masks were attached to ventilators, which pumped pressurised air into the masks thereby avoiding the need for patient intubation. The concept proved feasible, however, further refinement was needed. Immediately, Decathlon halted the sale of the Easybreath to reserve its stock for medical purposes, and the healthcare community encouraged the development of low-cost accessories that could achieve this purpose.

In March, as the COVID-19 outbreak hit Europe, Airbus began collaborating with local hospitals on a project to further develop Easybreath mask applications. The project, which was selected as part of the COVID-19 hackathon organised by the Airbus Humanity Lab, focuses on adapting the Easybreath for two different applications: as personal protective equipment for healthcare professionals on the front line of the crisis and as a non-invasive ventilation mask for patients.

The success of this project lies in collaboration, agility and solidarity. It’s a great example of Airbus values and know-how. I’m very proud to be a part of this multinational team.

- Alvaro Jara, Head of Airbus ProtoSpace Getafe

The leap from concept to reality

Today, the project team is developing a complete kit of 3D-printed parts—including adaptors and valves—in preparation for large-scale production.

At the Infanta Leonor hospital in Madrid, the 3D-printed parts have already been tested and used with the masks, a modular prototype design that can be used both ways as personal protective equipment and as a ventilation mask. Clinical trials in Spain are ongoing. In France, a prototype for personal protective equipment was provided to medical staff at Clinique Pasteur in Toulouse and CHU Bayonne. The project team then collaborated with a French consortium—including the industrial company BIC and retailer Decathlon—to develop and mass-produce a similar part, which is now authorised for use across the country. Airbus UK has also succeeded in manufacturing adaptors based on the Italian concept.

“The 3D-printed adaptors for the Easybreath mask are a simple, cost-effective solution that will make a real difference in the lives of doctors and patients during the COVID-19 pandemic,” says Christophe Debard, Founder of the Airbus Humanity Lab.

The collaborative team—composed of Airbus ProtoSpace in Toulouse and in Getafe, Airbus St. Eloi and Seville production sites, local fab-labs, individual makers, Safran Electrical & Power, and CT Ingenieros in Spain—will continue to organise parts production over the next few weeks. Airbus’ role is to coordinate and support design and manufacturing activities, as well as logistics.

“The success of this project lies in collaboration, agility and solidarity,” says Alvaro Jara, Head of Airbus ProtoSpace Getafe. “It’s a great example of Airbus values and know-how. I’m very proud to be a part of this multinational team.”"

By Tim Hepher

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus is studying a sharp cut in output of its top-selling A320 plane series amid an industry-wide slowdown triggered by the coronavirus crisis, sources familiar with the matter said.

Europe's leading planemaker is examining scenarios including cutting its monthly output of 60 A320-family jets by as much as half for around three to six months as airlines scramble to save cash, two of the sources told Reuters.

Airbus <AIR.PA> has asked A320 parts suppliers to slow their deliveries to its factories by 40% to a rate compatible with production of 36 jets a month in the near term, one source said.

The coronavirus crisis has blindsided airlines and planemakers, prompting bailouts and drastic revisions.

Airbus additionally faces shortages in its own supply chain as it struggles to bring production back up to previous levels after pausing activity in several factories.

Airbus, which last month suspended its near-term 2020 delivery guidance, entered the coronavirus crisis with plans to increase A320-family production to 63 a month in 2021 and to add a further one to two planes per month in both 2022 and 2023.

Those plans have been shelved, the sources said.

Airbus said it was ""closely monitoring the evolving COVID-19 situation worldwide and is in constant dialogue with ...customers, suppliers and institutional partners.""

The planemaker added it was ""assessing the implications of the pandemic on its operations and the potential mitigation measures that could be implemented.""

HALF SPEED

A final decision is expected by the company's shareholder meeting in mid-April and depends on several unknowns, including how long the air travel crisis will last.

Airbus is expected to try to avoid mandatory lay-offs and make use of short-time working schemes in France and Germany.

Reuters reported on Thursday that Airbus and rival Boeing <BA.N> were also studying sharp cuts in production of larger, wide-body jets such as the Airbus A350 or Boeing 777.

Story continues

Suppliers for the A350 are being ordered to run for now at about half-speed, equivalent to 5 aircraft a month compared with about 9.5 before the crisis, the sources said. The A330 family, which recently slowed to 3.5 jets a month, could dip to two.

The rate at which suppliers are instructed to feed assembly lines does not always match official production rates in order to avoid disruptive whiplash effects in the supply chain.

Airbus and Boeing have a buffer of thousands of aircraft orders and have until now been able to find new homes for the most in-demand passenger jets like the A320 and 737, although Boeing is also wrestling with the grounding of its 737 MAX.

But the depth of the crisis and a worldwide meltdown in travel demand have raised questions over whether some of the airlines that placed large orders will survive, analysts say.

Airbus and Boeing have indicated they will adjust supply to demand rather than build aircraft that cannot be delivered.

Cuts in production of wide-body, long-haul jets could be deeper and last longer as international travel restrictions compound an existing problem of surplus capacity.

Delta working with Airbus on order book after deferring A350 orders linked to Latam - Yahoo Finance,"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9kZWx0YS1hYnNvcmJzLW9yZGVyLTEwLWFpcmJ1cy0xMjU5MTE4NDYuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SAO PAULO/PARIS (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc <DAL.N> confirmed on Tuesday it had taken over an order for 10 Airbus <AIR.PA> A350 jets from Latam Airlines Group <LTM.S>, but said it had deferred several of the near-term deliveries and was working with Airbus on options across its entire order book.

A Delta spokeswoman said the 10 A350 aircraft, which stem from Delta's tie-up agreement with Chilean carrier Latam, would be delivered through 2025.

The deal, which Reuters reported earlier on Tuesday, firms up a planned switch first announced when the two carriers forged their alliance in 2019 and whose completion was partially disclosed in manufacturing data issued last week.

The formal transfer of the jet order, worth roughly $3 billion at list prices, coincides with Delta and other U.S. airlines negotiating government aid to help them meet their payroll costs while dealing with a drastic drop in air travel demand because of the coronavirus pandemic.

""Given the current environment, we are working in close partnership with Airbus on further rescheduling opportunities across our entire order book,"" Delta spokeswoman Lisa Hanna said.

Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian told employees on Tuesday that the airline would receive $5.4 billion in U.S. government payroll support that would protect jobs through Sept. 30, but continued to encourage workers to consider taking unpaid leaves of absence as it weathers a 95% decline in passenger traffic.

Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people with knowledge of the matter, that Delta had agreed to sell and lease back aircraft valued at $1 billion as part of efforts to raise cash while it continues talks about U.S. government aid.

Delta did not comment on the report.

Happy birthday to a cool satellite - Airbus,"Wed, 08 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC0wNC1oYXBweS1iaXJ0aGRheS10by1hLWNvb2wtc2F0ZWxsaXRl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus-built CryoSat-2 gathering snow and ice data for a decade

Friedrichshafen, 08 April 2020 – Happy birthday to a ""cool"" satellite: CryoSat-2, the European Space Agency´s ice and snow satellite, was launched from the Baikonour Cosmodrone into orbit on 08 April 2010. Originally designed for a three and a half year mission, CryoSat-2 has been operating since 2010, far exceeding its nominal mission lifetime. Actual health data of the Airbus-built 720 kilogram spacecraft triggered programmatic funds to keep it operational until end 2021. Over the last decade the satellite reached an operational availability close to 99 percent and delivered almost 350 Terabytes of data - the equivalent of a 1,400 km long bookshelf.

Over the past 10 years, CryoSat-2 has delivered a wealth of information about Earth's changing ice cover and thickness, and has demonstrated that it is a valuable data source for oceanography, hydrology and geodesy, exceeding expectations with a range of results that go far beyond its original goals. CryoSat-2 has also made remarkable contributions to our understanding of the cryosphere and its effect on Earth’s climate.

A tenth of Earth's land surface is permanently covered by ice sheets or glaciers. The cryosphere is an important regulator of global climate, its bright albedo reflecting sunlight back to space and its presence influencing regional weather and global ocean currents. Some 77 percent of the globe’s freshwater is held within the ice – but the cryosphere appears disproportionately sensitive to the effects of global warming.

One example of data provided by CryoSat is that ice losses from Antarctica have increased global sea levels by 7.6 mm since 1992, with two fifths of this rise (3.0 mm) coming in the last five years. Antarctica stores enough frozen water to raise global sea level by 58 metres. Knowing how much ice it is losing, is key to understanding - today and in the future - the impact of melting ice masses on global climate change. Greenland has lost 266 billion tons of ice in a 16 year period.

Another example of the benefits of CryoSat measurements are operational services covering sea ice, wind and waves, bathymetry and iceberg monitoring for maritime purposes.

Radar altimeters gather data on changing ice height and mass: ESA's CryoSat is the first altimetry mission specifically designed to accurately measure the thickness of sea ice and land ice margins. CryoSat has two antennas, its dual-antenna radar SIRAL scans the surface very precisely giving an accurate perception of depth in the same way that our eyes enable a three dimensional view. Experts call this radar interferometry. With this system, an average accuracy of one to three centimetres can be reached. It can also collect data on non-homogeneous ice structures with very steep walls in the polar seas, glaciers or ice sheets. CryoSat's radar altimeter works day and night and can also penetrate cloud cover. Therefore, it is particularly suited to monitoring the large polar ice sheets, which are often covered by clouds.

TOP 5 Airbus plane designs inspired by animals - AeroTime,"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjQ4MzAtdG9wLTUtYWlyYnVzLXBsYW5lLWRlc2lnbnMtaW5zcGlyZWQtYnktYW5pbWFsc9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjQ4MzAtdG9wLTUtYWlyYnVzLXBsYW5lLWRlc2lnbnMtaW5zcGlyZWQtYnktYW5pbWFscy9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus brands itself as an expert of biomimicry ‒ taking inspiration from nature by observing animals and trying to reapply some things they do in their engineering. While many of these projects are still in the development stage, below are five examples of aviation’s inspiration on nature.

5. Silent planes

Not exactly an aircraft concept, but rather improvements for their parts such as wings or landing gear come from Airbus’ studies of owls. Contrary to most birds, owls have primary feathers serrated like a comb. These feathers allow the air to pass easily through their wings, which, in turn, muffles the sound of air flowing over the wing.

The European aerospace company is studying these birds in hopes of unlocking the secret of silent flight, and some of its current ideas include retractable, brush-like fringe on aircraft’s wings and a velvety coating on a landing gear.

4. Airbus fello’fly project

With the fello’fly project, Airbus is experimenting on alternative flying techniques of commercial aircraft that could boost fuel savings. Having officially unveiled the concept during the Dubai Airshow in November 2019, Airbus reportedly began flight tests with two of its A350XWB aircraft in March 2020.

The fello’fly idea is heavily embedded in biomimicry and is based on snow goose and their “wake-energy retrieval” flight technique. In other words, geese flocks often fly in a “V” shape, which allows them to stay aloft over long distances with minimal fatigue.

In this formation, birds benefit from free lift: follower geese surf on the wakes (left-over kinetic energy of moving air) created by the leader bird, Airbus observes. The company hopes to apply this model to commercial air travel, as flying in formation would allow for 5% to 10% fuel savings per trip, as its own studies show.

3. Airbus Bird of Prey

Bird of Prey is Airbus’ concept of a hybrid-electric, turbo-propeller regional aircraft for up to 80 passengers. It is heavily inspired by soaring birds, in particular bald eagles and their long, broad wings. Bird of Prey design mimics the eagle’s wing and tail structure, and even has individually controlled feathers for active flight control.

The theoretical design was unveiled at the Royal International Air Tattoo event in July 2019. The concept is not intended to represent an actual aircraft though, as Airbus cautions.

2. Airbus A320neo wing sharklets

All new Airbus A320neos, and some of the older A320 family planes, feature upwards-bent wingtips ‒ sharklets. They are used to reduce induced drag when an aircraft is airborne by reducing the size of wingtip vortex.

As the sharklet name suggests, the technology is named after white sharks, in particular, their dorsal fins. Airbus observed movement similarity between a shark and an aircraft. For instance, to move forward, the shark swings its tail to push water around its fins, while the aircraft pushes air around wings to create a lift. In addition, “shark also has dorsal fins that work exactly like the vertical stabiliser wing on an aircraft, giving it exceptional manoeuvrability,” the company has outlined.

1. Airbus Beluga

This list would not be complete without the mention of the animal after which Airbus super-transporter is named after. While contrary to all of the concepts above, Airbus never mentioned the Beluga whale as inspiration for engineering the Beluga ST or XL, the similarity between the heavy-weight airlifter and the animal is uncanny; and widely admired.

Airbus aircraft cabins have become far more customisable in recent years, leaving customers facing a huge number of choices, but technological innovations are helping to smooth the process.

Thierry ORILLAC, A350 Cabin

Project Leader

Thierry explains more:

""People who haven’t worked in an airline cabin, don’t always realise how complex it is.

They can just think it’s about seats, toilets and a galley and that’s it.

But there are also partitions, curtains, storage, lights, air conditioning, cabin communication systems and much more. And there is also a lot of interconnection in the cabin – so there is a domino effect, if you change one option it has knock-on effects elsewhere.

Driving an airline’s choices in the cabin are the different objectives of its teams – so cabin definition means balancing the priorities of management, alongside marketing teams and other airline teams such as cabin crew, catering and engineering.

Each cabin definition project is unique and as detailed as the airline wishes. Airlines’ aims vary depending on their goal as a carrier – for example, whether they’re targeting domestic or international passengers. But they all want to differentiate themselves from the competition. And they are all seeking profitability.

If they are investing a lot in the cabin, they also want a quick return on that investment.""

Cabin criteria

There are several variables for airline customers to consider when defining their cabin.

If it’s a big airline, there can be many stakeholders. While with smaller airlines, we are sometimes in direct contact with the CEO or board members. We have many ways to support the customer and we work to balance the best package for them and help them to take a decision.

Alongside the customer’s requirements, there are also regulatory obligations from the aviation authorities and technical constraints from Airbus – for example, not exceeding weight limits. In addition, there can be mandatory operational requirements from the airline to be considered – for example, having a minimum number of trolleys by the aircraft door, or no seats in front of the lavatory entrance.

After that, airlines are looking at points of differentiation for their cabin, features they want for passengers, requirements for cabin crew to perform effectively, and any additional necessities for pilots or engineering and maintenance personnel.

The requirements of airline and Airbus suppliers also need considering. We work in partnership with them to get the required equipment into the cabin.

The layout of the cabin is the main factor as it provides the basis for the cabin definition. This depends on the needs of the airlines, but we also have to consider integration into the aircraft. We’re creating a unique solution for each airline based on its requirement – considering seat models, lavatories, storage etc.

The cabin layout is modified and updated as the project progresses. Usually it’s about finding a compromise that works for the airlines, for example, there is a maximum number of possible seats and galleys. It’s about adapting the original requirement.

Definition Journey

The Airbus teams help guide the customer through the definition process.

After the kick-off meeting, customers have a product offer demonstration at the CDC, where they see the variety of the cabin offer. Suppliers – such as seat manufacturers - are present as needed to explain their products.

After the demonstration, comes the definition meeting. And then at the end is the Cabin Definition Closure Meeting, where we go step-by-step through the definition document. Then we sign the definition document with the customer and suppliers. Based on that document we build the cabin. Once that is done, the delivery centre and other customer teams take care of the delivery phase.

One-stop-shop

In March 2019, Airbus opened its extended Airspace Customer Definition Centre (CDC) in Hamburg for cross-programme cabin customisation including the A320 and A330 Family programmes – alongside the existing A350 XWB Family customisation areas.

Alexander JUERS, Project Manager,

Customer Definition Centre (CDC)

Alexander explains:

""The CDC now fully adopts the Airspace cabin brand, (see below “What is Airspace?”) which was first launched with the A330neo, and sets new cabin standards of comfort, ambience, service and design for airlines and their passengers.

Our teams, tools and state-of-the-art technology at the CDC are there to make it easier and faster for our customers to define their cabins.

A customer visit to the CDC typically lasts two to three days, with most visits dedicated to cabin definition although some are to support customer sales campaigns.

Today, many A350 XWB customers are also A320 or A330 operators, so the enhanced centre is a win-win situation for all stakeholders to streamline cabin definition across their fleet.

The CDC is the one-stop-shop for cabin customisation. Customers no longer need to travel to multiple destinations to see suppliers; they now have the CDC that brings together all the right people from Airbus and the suppliers in one place.

Customers can come to the centre and see what their future product will look like – using fully-integrated cabin mock-ups, virtual reality and mixed-reality tools.""

Watch the Airspace Cabin Vision 2030

What is Airspace?

Airspace is Airbus’ innovative cabin brand. Launched in 2016, it was created with passengers at heart and airlines in mind, and built around four key pillars: comfort, ambience, services and design. Signature design elements recognisable throughout all Airspace cabins offer more personal space; larger overhead storage bins; spacious, contemporary and more hygienic lavatories. Other features are personalised in-flight entertainment and connectivity options, a unique and customisable welcome area, the latest in LED technology for ambient lighting; plus straight lines, clean shapes and clear surfaces throughout the interior.

Delivered on Airbus’ A330neo and A350 XWB, and soon to be installed on the A320neo Family, the Airspace passenger experience will be available across the Airbus fleet and benefit travellers on all kinds of routes.

Definition process

Defining a customer’s cabin requirements can take anywhere from 6 months to 2 years.

Based on initial discussions with the customer, Airbus presents its cabin offer, adapting it to the customer’s objectives.

The customer works with Airbus on the specificities, progressing step-by-step through each commodity to reach a final decision.

Both parties fix the main concept of the cabin and requirements, reach the Contractual Definition Freeze (CDF) and sign a contract.

Airbus assembles the cabin, bringing all the parts into the aircraft before performing the final physical validation with the airline.

The referenced media source is missing and needs to be re-embedded.

Zoning in

In the CDC, the customers are led through specifically designed areas, from the private customer lounge to a hub of meeting rooms, from where they access the centre’s different zones.

Huge screens with virtual reality (VR) capabilities represent a 1:1 scale cabin experience. Using VR goggles, customers can move around a virtual cabin in 3D where their specification has been applied.

From that room, they can move into different functional zones, view the real equipment, access mixed-reality rooms and mock-up rooms, to clarify specific cabin situations further enriching the Virtual Reality. Today, the customer always asks for a combination of VR and hardware - it’s about making the definition as easy as possible for the customer.

Integrated mock-up rooms

When the customer is defining the cabin in 2D and 3D, they typically want to see the real equipment, such as seat options. We have fully-integrated mock-ups for A350, A320 and A330.

Customers can test fully functional seats in a cabin environment, so they can see how they feel in the aircraft. As the CDC is also a partnership platform, suppliers are invited so customers can get their questions answered on the spot.

As they make decisions, the customer’s specification is loaded into a file, with selections added to the 3D model so they can view it in VR. Mock-up zones for different areas of the cabin, such as galleys and lavatories, help customers further define the cabin.

Some customers bring their cabin staff to test out the galleys and equipment, and it becomes a ‘cooking session’ to see how the space and equipment performs.

Over the last few years, cabin lighting options have gained increasing importance alongside material trim and finish. Previously, there were a lot of material trim and finishes - which we still do, but they are more harmonised with lighting as customers take advantage of advanced systems.

We have dedicated mock-ups, where customers can define their lighting scenarios. There are 16.7 million colours in the lighting system on the A350; with the most advanced full LED system, you can enrich atmosphere in an aircraft. Customers can test materials and see how they change the finish of the cabin with different lighting.

Scenario testing

The speed that customers can access bespoke physical mock-ups at the CDC is one of its strengths. One airline customer was able to experience a specific door zone arrangement, taking advantage of VR and hardware.

They wanted to establish if there was sufficient clearance for cabin crew and passengers during the onboarding procedures. We mocked-up the respective door zone including lavatory and galley, as well as the area in front of it, to test the specific layout arrangement. Management and cabin crew came to test it with the onboard furniture and were able to perform the check within one day and validate the definition.

Configuring the layout

The Configure Room is where customers get more of a feel for the environment and space. This mixed-reality room has projectors in the ceiling, projecting in one-to-one scale the floor layout on the ground – showing galleys, lavatories, seats etc. Alongside original cabin elements and dimension mock-ups, customers can perform tests of alternative layouts and scenarios.

It allows customers to test the space on a functional level, as well as get a sense of the passenger experience. It helps them reach a balance between function and design. They get the impression of space. For example, they can test if a trolley goes smoothly through the aisle or the galley environment.

Customers can control the layout and change it easily. We can re-arrange room and cabin layout on the spot for them. The room is ideal for a group of people moving around together and reaching decisions.

The combination of functional playrooms for cabin equipment testing, exhibition areas for typical airline product staging, design studios for material and mood light definitions, virtual and augmented-reality technology complemented by customer-specific mock-up areas, make a unique space for customers.

The experience at the CDC is always customised, it’s for the customer to decide how to use it. The centre supports a faster process with full transparency and fosters decision-making. We bring all the people with the right knowledge together, so we can clarify things immediately for customers.

Retro-fitting

Retro-fitting a cabin has more technical constraints than line-fitting. We have to take into account the current aircraft we’re going to refurbish and the current specification it has, so there can be additional limitations.

Most of the airlines want to minimise the cost of refurbishment, so they want to use the most cost-efficient modifications – and we can support them to do that.

Customer experience

Morio Suzuki Manager, Interior Group, Engineering Project Office, JAL Engineering (JALEC)

Talks about introducing the A350-900 into Japan Airlines’ domestic fleet.

What are some of the most challenging things about choosing a cabin?

“The most challenging thing is making a seat layout to provide satisfaction and a good cabin experience to our customers. We need to pursue a maximized passenger area within a profitable range and certification restrictions. Airbus’s configuration tool provides lots of help to seek the viable and certifiable layout as it gives warnings when the selected layout goes against certification rules.”

How does the process for cabin definition compare now with how it was 10-20 years ago?

“3D imaging tools and viewers, such as VR, provide advanced experience. Before actual aircraft production, we can feel as if we are actually in the cabin. I remember when I entered the actual A350 cabin, I had a feeling of déjà vu: the actual aircraft was produced as per the image that we saw several months ago in the VR.”

What are JAL’s priorities when defining a cabin?

“Everything is for our customer. The passenger area is the first priority. The second one is the functionality of the seat (electrical motion, IFE, PC power, WiFi).”

Conclusion

Rapid solutions for customers

Cabin definition is a complex process with many deliverables. Despite increasing harmonisation of processes and tools, there are a huge number of deliverables to provide the cabin as expected by the airline. The number of interfaces internally and externally, with the airline and suppliers is also complex.

But advances in digitalisation are helping provide tools such as the virtual and mixed-reality mock-ups in the Customer Definition Centre, that make it easier for customers to define their cabin; it is becoming faster and simpler for them every day."
EasyJet founder threatens legal action over Airbus order - Flightglobal,"Wed, 08 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vc3RyYXRlZ3kvZWFzeWpldC1mb3VuZGVyLXRocmVhdGVucy1sZWdhbC1hY3Rpb24tb3Zlci1haXJidXMtb3JkZXIvMTM3ODEwLmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"EasyJet is standing behind its chief financial officer and its decision to borrow millions from the UK government after a fresh attack from founder and major shareholder Stelios Haji-Iaonnou, who is threatening to take legal action against the budget carrier.

The dispute is centred on an order for 107 Airbus aircraft, which Haji-Iaonnou argues should be cancelled or renegotiated in light of the heavy toll the coronavirus pandemic is taking on the aviation industry.

After threatening to dismantle EasyJet’s board one director at a time – starting with Andreas Bierwirth and moving on to chief financial officer Andrew Findlay – Haji-Iaonnou said on 6 April that he would not inject any fresh capital into the airline while the Airbus contract remained in place.

EasyJet has since announced plans to borrow £600 million ($740 million) from the UK government’s Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF) – a move Haji-Iaonnou describes as a “misuse of UK taxpayers’ money”.

In a strongly worded statement published on the London Stock Exchange on 8 April, he writes: “The reason Findlay wants to borrow this £600 million from the UK taxpayer is to pay [Airbus] £2 billion – that is the liability between this year and next year, and before the government loan is due for repayment.”

He adds that if EasyJet sends money to Airbus and fails to repay the UK government in March 2021, he will “personally sue” those involved for breach of their fiduciary duties.

Questioning the logic of keeping an aircraft order while much of the airline industry remains grounded, Haji-Iaonnou asks: “When was the last time in the history of aviation that one airline went from having £6 billion in revenues per year to zero revenues inside one month, with no firm date set in the future for returning to carrying fare-paying passengers? Why are these directors of EasyJet so keen to keep paying Airbus for additional redundant planes?”

EasyJet has responded to this latest escalation by saying it “fully supports Andrew Findlay” and “stands by its collective decision to access the CCFF, which was made in the best interests of the company”.

The carrier adds: “We remain absolutely focused on removing expenditure from the business, engaging with all of our business partners and suppliers including Airbus, and on safeguarding jobs and short-term liquidity.”

Holding a general meeting would, EasyJet argues, “be an unhelpful distraction from tackling the many immediate issues our business faces”.

In an 8 April research note, HSBC writes that the money raised through the government facility and the planned drawdown of a $500 million revolving credit facility will strengthen EasyJet’s financial position, but the bank expects the dispute with Haji-Iaonnou to rumble on.

“We think that recent developments have been constructive for the company’s liquidity, de-risking its outlook,” writes HSBC, adding that “the debate with the founder is likely to continue until the shape of the post-virus business is defined and its cash distribution policy is defined”.

Haji-Iaonnou has in the past argued that EasyJet should adopt a fixed dividend payout amounting to half of post-tax profits, and follow rival Ryanair’s approach of buying back shares."
Germany to replace Tornado bombers with Airbus and Boeing fighter jets - The Defense Post,"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRlZmVuc2Vwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIwLzA0LzIwL2dlcm1hbnktYWlyYnVzLWJvZWluZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BERLIN, Germany (AFP) – Germany confirmed Monday it aims to replace its aging fleet of Tornado fighter-bombers with aircraft from both European manufacturer Airbus and U.S.-based Boeing.

Berlin is eager to balance European and American alliances via its military aircraft-buying scheme, but the decision to move ahead with the U.S. purchases has angered some politicians who allege a lack of transparency.

An official decision on the procurement plan will be sent to parliament’s defence committee “in the coming days,” defense ministry spokesperson Arne Collatz-Johannsen told reporters in Berlin.

“Fewer than a third” of the new aircraft would be American models, with the majority made up of European products, he added.

A source close to the plans confirmed German media reports that the defense ministry prefers to hedge its bets between E.U. and U.S. suppliers, by purchasing around 90 Airbus-made Eurofighters and 45 Boeing F-18 jets.

A solution balancing allies on both sides of the Atlantic is seen by the conservative-led defense ministry as vital because even after the Tornados are retired, Germany must maintain its air force’s capability to carry American nuclear weapons as part of its commitments under the NATO military alliance.

At present, the Tornado is the only Luftwaffe, or air force, aircraft certified to carry the nuclear bombs.

“We recommend a mixed solution which would keep the European defense ministry running at capacity and what’s more, concerning less than a third of the total, possibly come from non-European suppliers,” Collatz-Johannsen said.

Grumbling in the ranks

German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer had told her American counterpart Mark Esper about the plans over the weekend, the spokesperson said.

Der Spiegel magazine recently cited a German federal auditors’ report describing the 1970s-era Tornado as a “weapons system that has become obsolete, increasingly marked by technical faults and lack of availability.”

Collatz-Johannsen said operating the planes would “no longer be economical” by 2030, making 2025 the deadline for finding a replacement.

Meanwhile a Franco-German next-generation fighter dubbed the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) is not expected to be ready until 2040.

“That leaves us with a capability gap to bridge,” the defense spokesman said.

But minister Kramp-Karrenbauer’s decision to inform the U.S. early – a final procurement decision is unlikely before the next parliament beginning in 2021 – has angered some from the the center-left social democrats (SPD), junior coalition partners in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government.

“Nothing has been made transparent to us in any way,” defense committee chief Wolfgang Hellmich told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily.

Airbus says virus aviation crisis still at 'early stage' - NBC 15 WPMI,"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbXluYmMxNS5jb20vbmV3cy9jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy9haXJidXMtc2F5cy12aXJ1cy1hdmlhdGlvbi1jcmlzaXMtc3RpbGwtYXQtZWFybHktc3RhZ2XSAV9odHRwczovL215bmJjMTUuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzL2FpcmJ1cy1zYXlzLXZpcnVzLWF2aWF0aW9uLWNyaXNpcy1zdGlsbC1hdC1lYXJseS1zdGFnZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS (AP) — says the aviation industry's unprecedented troubles are just beginning.



The European manufacturing giant reported 481 million euros ($515 million) in losses in the first quarter, put thousands of workers on furlough and sought billions in loans to survive the . And its CEO said Wednesday it's still at an ""early stage.""

Even after virus-related travel restrictions eventually ease, Chief Executive Guillaume Faury acknowledged it will take a long time to persuade customers to get back on planes. Just how long, he can't predict.

""We are in the gravest crisis the aerospace industry has ever known,"" Faury said. ""Now we need to work as an industry to restore passenger confidence in air travel as we learn to coexist with this pandemic.""

Images shared online of packed planes and maskless, elbow-to-elbow passengers on U.S. flights - despite virus protection guidelines - have worried travelers and airline unions alike. International travel restrictions, meanwhile, have grounded thousands of planes worldwide.

Faury insisted that airplanes are ""probably the best place to be"" during a virus outbreak because of air filtration systems put in place after previous virus outbreaks and other threats, but said Airbus will work with aviation authorities to try to calm the public.



Shares in Airbus and Boeing have dropped some 60% this year as customer airlines collapse or seek billions of dollars in government bailouts.

Airbus was unable to deliver 60 planned planes in the quarter because of virus-related problems, and said the second quarter looks similarly rough. Customers are asking for delays, which Faury called ""the biggest issue we are managing at the moment.""

Airbus executives expressed hope Wednesday that deliveries could start picking up in the second half of the year. But they refused to issue long-term guidance given that the virus is still spreading, and that governments are reluctant to relax international travel restrictions.

U.S. rival Boeing is facing similar woes. Boeing's CEO said Monday that it will take years for the aircraft-building business to return to levels seen before the coronavirus pandemic.

Airbus has slashed production by a third since the virus hit, and Faury said Airbus will study ""resizing"" the company after the crisis ebbs - a worrying prospect on a continent where Airbus has factories in four countries and is one of the region's industrial leaders.

Already 3,000 Airbus workers in France are on temporary unemployment and the number is expected to grow. In addition, 3,200 workers in the U.K. are on furlough and negotiations are under way to put thousands of German workers on short work plans.

A recent letter by Faury warning workers that the company is ""bleeding cash"" was a shock to many. But Frederic Romain of French union CFTC said ""the situation requires transparency. It allows workers to open their eyes"" to what's ahead.

""Fears? We have a lot of them. For the moment we don't have a clear vision of what awaits us,"" Romain said.

Airbus reported a 15% drop in revenues to 10.6 billion euros in the first quarter.

Looking longer term, Faury insisted that Airbus remains committed to reducing airplane emissions but said it's ""less urgent"" than before the coronavirus crisis because the company has more pressing problems to solve. ""For practical cash reasons,"" Airbus has stopped or suspended some projects aimed at ""decarbonizing"" its production, he said."
An Airbus MRTT Test Aircraft Has Carried Out The World's First Ever Fully Automatic Refuelling Contacts - The Aviationist,"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3RoZWF2aWF0aW9uaXN0LmNvbS8yMDIwLzA0LzE3L2FuLWFpcmJ1cy1tcnR0LXRlc3QtYWlyY3JhZnQtaGFzLWNhcnJpZWQtb3V0LXRoZS13b3JsZHMtZmlyc3QtZXZlci1mdWxseS1hdXRvbWF0aWMtcmVmdWVsbGluZy1jb250YWN0cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The A330 MRTT will be equipped the first automatic aerial refueling with a boom system.

An Airbus MRTT test aircraft has successfully completed the first ever fully Automatic Air-to-Air Refuelling (A3R) operation with a boom system, Airbus has just announced. The milestone was achieved during a flight test campaign, conducted earlier in the year over the Atlantic Ocean, using an Airbus 310 MRTT test aircraft equipped with the Airbus A3R solution and a Portuguese Air Force F-16 jet acting as a receiver.

“This milestone is part of the industrialisation phase of A3R systems ahead of its implementation in the A330 MRTT tanker development,” says the official news release on the company website.

The testing campaign was made of 45 flight test hours and 120 dry contacts with the A3R system; the certification phase will start in 2021.

The way the A3R system operates is particularly interesting, as it gives a clear idea about the level of automation achieved in the field of the aerial refueling:

“The A3R system requires no additional equipment on the receiver aircraft and is intended to reduce air refuelling operator (ARO) workload, improve safety and optimise the rate of air-to-air refuelling transfer in operational conditions, helping maximise aerial superiority. The goal for the A3R system is to develop technologies that will reach fully autonomous capabilities. Once the system is activated by the ARO, the A3R flies the boom automatically and keeps the alignment between the boom tip and the receiver receptacle with an accuracy of a couple of centimeters; the proper alignment and the receiver stability is checked in real-time to keep a safe distance between the boom and the receiver and also to determine the optimum moment to extend the telescopic beam to achieve the connection with the receiver. At this point, the fuel transfer is initiated to fill up the receiver aircraft and once completed and the disconnection is commanded, the boom is cleared away from the receiver by retracting the telescopic beam and flying the boom away to keep a safe separation distance. During this process, the ARO simply monitors the operation.”

This represent a significant development in the aerial refueling operations that involve the use of a flying boom a rigid, telescoping tube, maneuvered by a “boom operator” by means of a control stick. As opposed to the “hose and drogue” system this AAR system has the advantage to eliminate the requirement for the receiver pilot to plug the IFR (In Flight Refueling) probe into the hose’s drogue: once the aircraft has reached the refueling position the operator moves the boom to insert the tube in the receptacle of the receiver aircraft. The flying boom is the standard AAR system used by the U.S. Air Force and required by aircraft that are equipped with a receptacle (as the F-16, F-15 or the F-35).

Unlike the “hose and drogue” system with the flying boom, the effort of the AAR operation is mostly on the “boomer” (another nickname for the operator who moves the telescoping tube). In the previous generation tankers, as the U.S. KC-135 and KC-10, the boomer had to control the boom while lying prone inside a boom operator station located in the rear of the aircraft, watching the receiver through a rear observation window. More modern tankers, as the KC-767 and the problematic KC-46, use a remote boom operator’s station located behind the cockpit from where boomers move the boom using a joystick and watching the video from a series of cameras mounted on the tanker’s fuselage: the advanced camera system feeds a Remote Vision System (RVS) that provides high-definition stereoscopic imagery to the vision goggles attached to a sort-of flight helmet worn by the boomer during the air-to-air refueling.

That said, the A3R systems, like the one being developed by Airbus for the successful A330 MRTT, will probably be the reference for future refueling operation aboard manned tankers.

Note: a previous version of this article stated that the aircraft involved in the test was an A330 MRTT. Actually, Airbus news release didn’t specify the aircraft type (it refers to a generic MRTT test aircraft) but a reader spotted in a video that the test article involved in the test was an A310MRTT.

Airbus works to support Florida JV to sustain OneWeb vision - Runway Girl Network,"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjAvMDQvYWlyYnVzLXdvcmtzLXRvLXN1cHBvcnQtZmxvcmlkYS1qdi10by1zdXN0YWluLW9uZXdlYi12aXNpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is working to support its Space Coast-based satellite production joint venture facility “in finding a way through, to ensure that the vision of the OneWeb constellation can be sustained”, after its JV partner OneWeb filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month. OneWeb’s mission was to enable Internet access everywhere, for everyone.

The Exploration Park, Florida-headquartered 50-50 joint venture – largely known as OneWeb Satellites but formally named “Airbus OneWeb Satellites LLC” – laid claim to being the first to employ industrial-scale mass production techniques for satellites, enabling dramatically reduced costs and production times that could deliver two satellites per day.

Referencing the satellite production facility specifically – and not the separate OneWeb satellite operator – Debra Facktor, Head of Airbus US Space Systems, tells RGN:

OneWeb Satellites, the joint venture between Airbus and OneWeb, is going through difficult times with the Chapter 11 filing of OneWeb and the impact of COVID-19 directly on its operations. This is not an easy situation right now, but we at Airbus are doing all that we can to support OneWeb Satellites in finding a way through, to ensure that the vision of the OneWeb constellation can be sustained. Airbus is proud of our investments in developing the small satellite industrial base in the US and remains committed to keeping our people safe and healthy and supporting our customers’ missions during this difficult time.

Facktor also serves on the board of the OneWeb Satellites JV, which opened last year and quickly ramped up production. It was to manufacture over 600 satellites in support of the OneWeb program.

Shortly after celebrating the successful third launch of a batch of LEO satellites, London-headquartered OneWeb on 27 March filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New York to execute a sales process. OneWeb blamed the coronavirus pandemic as the reason why it faced difficulty in obtaining funding.

The news came after OneWeb failed to secure new funding from its biggest backer, Japan’s SoftBank. SpaceNews reported that OneWeb laid off 85% of its employees prior to the Chapter 11 filing. In subsequent filings to the bankruptcy court, OneWeb said the OneWeb Satellites JV can produce up to 15 satellites per week.

In addition to its JV with OneWeb, the broader Airbus Group owns 8.5% of the satellite operator.

Asked by RGN if Airbus has any interest in OneWeb’s assets – including spectrum – given that OneWeb is seeking a buyer, a spokesman for Airbus Defence and Space said the company cannot comment on the Chapter 11 process of OneWeb.

“OneWeb is the constellation operator and Airbus has no comment on OneWeb,” he said.

Press Release: Airbus mod enables pallet install onto floor seat tracks - Runway Girl Network,"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjAvMDQvcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZS1haXJidXMtbW9kLWVuYWJsZXMtcGFsbGV0LWluc3RhbGwtb250by1mbG9vci1zZWF0LXRyYWNrcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is developing a modification for A330 and A350 family aircraft which will enable airlines to install freight pallets directly onto the cabin floor seat tracks, after removal of the economy-class seats.

This solution will help with the airlines’ own business continuity, and also alleviate the global shortage of ‘belly-freight’ air cargo capacity due to the widespread grounding of long-haul aircraft in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Additionally, it helps the industry to address the high demand for humanitarian flights to transport large quantities of medical equipment and other supplies rapidly over large distances to where they are needed.

Compared with loading cargo onto seats, this Airbus solution facilitates easier and quicker loading and unloading operations, as well as reduced ‘wear & tear’ to the seats themselves.

Other important benefits include the added security of robust fire protection, and the 9g load restraint capability to prevent anything from shifting in flight.

The modification is packaged for operators as an Airbus Service Bulletin (SB). Under this arrangement Airbus defines the engineering workscope and also manages the process for obtaining the one-time certification from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).

Its scope includes the removal of the seats & IFE (Inflight entertainment), installation of cargo pallets and associated safety equipment – and also the re-installation of the original passenger cabin elements for reverting back to passenger operations.

The SB approach will also be valid beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

Thuraya Aero is an In-Flight Connectivity and data-sharing platform that uses mobile satellite communications to provide internet access, text messaging, phone calls, VOIP, video and audio conferencing as well as aerial surveillance, especially for Beyond-Line-of-Sight missions.

Airbus customers can now install and customize their Thuraya Aero kit when ordering new aircraft. Thuraya said the system will be fitted on the production line, with no need for further tests and verification, and the aircraft will be ready to use on delivery. This will allow it to be deployed immediately to deliver mission-critical capabilities instead of being grounded for months to retrofit communication systems.

Thuraya deputy CEO Sulaiman Al Ali said, “Line-fit certification, which undergoes a rigorous compliance process, is a testament to the reliability and robustness of our network and airborne satellite communications services. It is of paramount importance to our government customers to access onboard communication as soon as they take possession of their new aircraft so they are ready in their mission-critical duties.”"
"Airbus to furlough 3,000 staff in Wales after warning it is 'bleeding cash' - The Guardian","Mon, 27 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIwL2Fwci8yNy9haXJidXMtam9iLWN1dHMtc3RhZmYtY29yb25hdmlydXMtbG9ja2Rvd27SAVtodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMC9hcHIvMjcvYWlyYnVzLWpvYi1jdXRzLXN0YWZmLWNvcm9uYXZpcnVzLWxvY2tkb3du?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is to furlough more than 3,000 staff working at its site in north Wales, the company has said.

The announcement came after the plane maker’s chief executive, Guillaume Faury, warned the company was “bleeding cash at an unprecedented speed”.

Airbus said about half of the staff at its Broughton site would be placed on the UK government’s job retention scheme, which pays 80% of wages up to £2,500 a month. It is understood the company will top up salaries by a further 5% to 10%.

The coronavirus pandemic has led to airlines grounding the majority of their fleet and, earlier this month, Airbus announced a plan to cut its aircraft production rates by around a third.

An Airbus spokesman said the company had “agreed with its social partners to apply the government’s job retention scheme for approximately 3,200 production and production-support employees at its commercial aircraft site in Broughton”.

Airbus employs 13,500 people in the UK, at Broughton and at Filton in Bristol, and 135,000 people worldwide.

The aerospace manufacturer has already taken advantage of government schemes including a furlough programme in France to help pay nearly 3,000 local workers during the lockdown. It has also convinced banks to increase its line of credit, giving the airline “time to adapt and resize”.

Faury told staff in a letter that the plane maker was “bleeding cash at an unprecedented speed”, and had lost about a third of its business after scaling back production in response to the pandemic.

He wrote: “Yes, one third. And, frankly, that’s not even the worst-case scenario we could face. That may sound tough, but I want to be honest with you: there are still many unknowns.”

Airbus, which is one of the largest plane suppliers to commercial airlines, is considering other financial assistance including government-backed loans, according to Reuters. However, Faury warned that further measures and deeper cuts may be needed in a bleak message that signalled major job cuts.

He said: “We may now need to plan for more far-reaching measures. That’s because of the sheer magnitude of this crisis and its likely duration. Remember: we’ve lost a third of our business almost overnight and we need to cut costs throughout the company.

“We’re living through one of the largest economic shocks in history, so must consider all options. I am being straight and transparent with you, because I want to prepare you for the reality of our new operating environment. The survival of Airbus is in question if we don’t act now.”

The warning came weeks after the group announced it would slash the number of planes it produces by a third, due to travel restrictions that have wreaked havoc on global airlines and drastically reduced demand for new aircraft.

The company usually produces more than 60 of its most popular Airbus A320 model each month but is cutting that to 40. It will also reduce production of its A330 planes to two and A350s to six.

Airbus could end up revealing fresh job cuts as early as Wednesday, when it is due to release its first-quarter earnings.

A spokesman for Airbus said the company would not comment on internal communications.

Rhys McCarthy, national officer for aerospace at Unite, the union, said the message from the Airbus chief executive should serve as a “wake-up call” to the UK government and governments throughout Europe that they must provide state support to protect highly skilled jobs.

McCarthy added: “Government support will not just protect the workers directly employed in the aerospace industry but also the 100,000 plus workers in the UK who are employed in the industry’s supply chain.

“A do nothing approach will not only threaten tens of thousands of jobs, but make an economic recovery that more difficult and will result in UK forfeiting its leading role in aerospace.”"

Dreaming of palms and beaches rather than a white Christmas, I was able to secure reward tickets with Thai Airways and Airbus A350 from Brussels to Bangkok for my Christmas holiday.

Thailand has become a very popular holiday destination for Europeans, even if it is an 11-hour flight away from almost anywhere in Europe. Until now it hasn’t been a priority for me but needing an escape from snow and freezing temperatures, I decided it was about time.

I was able to secure a business class reward ticket with Thai Airways from Brussels, which wasn’t easy during Christmas holiday. The return trip set me back 82,500 SAS EuroBonus points and an American Express Companion Ticket.

Since I had plenty of time on the ground in Brussels, I had the chance to visit both The Loft and The Suite lounges before departure

Boarding

I arrive at the gate a few minutes ahead of scheduled boarding time. The line for priority boarding seems to equal the amount of business class seats on the Airbus A350. This isn’t surprising, since it’s Christmas Holiday for most of Europe and probably not many business travelers.

I boarded through the front door where I was greeted by two friendly flight attendants who point my to my seat 19K.

Cabin and seat

Thai Airways Airbus A350-900 business class cabin has eight rows in staggered 1-2-1 configuration with a total of 32 seats.

Thai Airways Airbus A350 business class cabin

If you’re traveling solo, I would recommend the window seats and the rows where the seat is closer to the window. These seats offer the best view out the window and the most privacy. Similarly, for couples my choice would be the center section “honeymoon” rows where you are close to you travel companion while retaining privacy. The other rows are preferable if you’re traveling solo and unable to get a window seat or just want some space between you and your travel companion. These seats are however close to aisle and offer less privacy.

Already waiting in my seat was the bedding and a basic Lacoste amenity kit. The slippers are a bit of a tight fit. The seats are very comfortable while seated, but slightly cramped for my 6’2” when converted to a bed.

My Airbus A350-900 is just over two years old. As a result, the interior is fresh and modern, and I like the bright purple colors of the cabin.

The entertainment system TV screen is crisp and clear, and the remote and seat controls are responsive and easy to use. The electrical outlet is near the floor in front of you, while the USB outlets is under the TV. WiFi is on the expensive side with $35 for 500MB and $60 for unlimited data. Buying smaller packages doesn’t really make sense as background services or apps on your laptop or smartphone with consume your data in no time.

My new favorite TV-show – The Airbus A350 rear view camera

Food and beverage

As soon as everyone is seated, I was offered a glass of Champagne. I was even offered a refill when the flight attendant came back to take my food order.

As soon as the fasten seatbelt sign is switched off after take-off, I was served another glass of Piper-Heidsieck Essentiel along with some nuts. The crew immediately starts to prepare the meal service and a few minutes later, my starter was served. The first course consists of Parma Ham, Creame Cheese and Roasted Scallops. It’s very good, although maybe not spectacular. The wine I have chosen, Chateau Tour Prignac 2016, is also very good and I stick to it throughout the meal.

For the main course I have chosen the Samrab Thai with green curry beef, deep-fried crab meat, soup, rice and stir-fried pickled turnip with eggs. I really enjoyed the dish and it was definitely the culinary highlight of the trip.

I was then offered a cheese plate which wasn’t on the menu before I had chocolate cream for dessert. Neither cheese plate nor the dessert was bad, but not very exciting either. I had a Glenmorangie The Lasanta 12YO single malt scotch whisky with the desert.





For breakfast I go with smoked salmon, scrambled eggs, bread, fruits and yoghurt. A solid, wholesome breakfast.

Thai Airways delivers a perfectly fine business class meal, although there is room for improvement. The cheese plate and desert are uninspiring, the presentation is simple, and everything is served on trays. The service is extremely efficient, perhaps a bit too much as it feels a bit robotic and impersonal. The crew is however, always smiling, friendly and helpful.

Thai Airways Business Class

Thai Airways delivered in line with my expectations. It’s not quite on the same level as Singapore Airlines or Qatar Airways, but not at all bad. The Airbus A350 is a fantastic aircraft and I like the cabin and seats, although a bit cramped. The food and service are good, but not spectacular. Entertainment system and Wifi were good as well, but a bit expensive.

All in all, I’m happy with my flight and I would gladly fly Thai Airways business class again."

This review was originally published in January of this year. The Singapore Airlines nonstop flight from Newark to Singapore was last operated on March 25, and the airline has cancelled most of its flights for the time being.

Singapore Airlines has held the title for the world's longest commercial flight on and off for the last several years, but last year Qantas of Australia made a splash when it decided to fly two of its brand-new 787 Dreamliners from New York and London to Sydney.

As part of Project Sunrise, Qantas used these flights as tests to learn more about the effects of ultralong-haul flying, but those were one-off test flights with no paying passengers aboard.

So the title of world's longest scheduled commercial flight is still owned by SQ21, which operates daily between Newark (EWR) and Singapore (SIN). With a block time of 18 and a half hours to complete the 9,534-mile journey, Singapore Flight 21 is, well, long. This flight has always been on my AvGeek bucket list, so I couldn't have been happier about being stuck in a metal tube for so much time. After my experience, though, it became clear that the flight's certainly not for everyone.

Booking

Because of the convenience of a nonstop flight, Singapore charges a pretty hefty premium for biz-class tickets on the flight. It's not unusual to see fares hovering closely to $5,000 or more for the round trip. If you don't need a flat bed, though, it's pretty easy to find deals on premium economy on this flight.

If you're set on flying flat, your best bet is to use miles for your ticket. Unfortunately, Singapore long-haul flights can't be booked with most Star Alliance partners. Your only two options are booking directly with Singapore KrisFlyer or with Alaska Mileage Plan.

Singapore releases a fair number of saver biz-class award seats, and the saver KrisFlyer award availability should match that of Alaska Mileage Plan. Singapore charges 99,000 miles for a saver seat, while Alaska charges 100,000 miles. Singapore also offers Advantage awards, which are more expensive (140,000 miles) than saver awards in exchange for expanded award availability.

Although no credit card points transfer to Alaska, all four of the major points currencies (Amex Membership Rewards, Chase Ultimate Rewards, Citi ThankYou Rewards and Capital One Miles) transfer to KrisFlyer.

Flight SQ 21 departs from Terminal B at Newark Liberty International Airport, which is home to almost all international airlines flying out of Newark. Since most of the international departures from Newark leave in the afternoon and evening, Terminal B was empty when I got there at 7 a.m.

Singapore's check-in counters are on the third level of Terminal B, and there was no wait for any of the 10 counters. I had already checked in online but couldn't print my boarding pass without visiting a counter.

The check-in agent was extremely friendly as she engaged me in small talk. She printed my boarding pass and directed me to the security checkpoint and lounge.

Even though I had TSA PreCheck printed on my boarding pass, the PreCheck lane wasn't open that early.

Singapore doesn't operate a lounge in Newark and instead contracts the Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse for its business-class passengers. The Clubhouse is one level above the gates, easily accessible by stairs or elevator.

The friendly lounge agent greeted me with a smile and explained that all food and beverages were included during my lounge visit. I chuckled when he handed me the lounge's Wi-Fi password (it was ""Spirit,"" like the budget airline).

The lounge was packed when I arrived. Virgin Atlantic flights don't depart until much later in the day, so the lounge must've been full with Singapore passengers. You can also access the Virgin Atlantic lounge with Priority Pass, but only between the hours of 12 p.m. and 5 p.m.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 7 ZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

The lounge is basically just one large room with different seating areas. There are no windows, and this is definitely one of the more bare-bones lounges that Virgin operates.

There is a small bar and some formal dining tables, but you can order off the menu from anywhere in the lounge.

Virgin was serving breakfast when I visited, and I wanted to save my appetite for food on board. All food and drinks were served by a waiter, as there was no buffet in the lounge.

My biggest gripe with the lounge was the bathroom and shower situation. There are two single-use restrooms and two single-use showers that double as restrooms when no one is showering. For a lounge that can easily fit 100 people, two single-use restrooms aren't enough. I had to wait multiple times to use the restroom.

I spent about 45 minutes in the lounge getting caught up with work before heading to the gate. The gate area was empty, which wasn't surprising, since Singapore A350-900ULRs — the ultra-long-range version of the Airbus A350 — only have 161 seats.

The departures board was the first and only reference to Singapore's flight being the world's longest.

Boarding began exactly 30 minutes before departure, and the entire plane was boarded within 15 minutes.

Singapore's business-class cabins on the A350 are really sleek and visually appealing. Seats are in a 1-2-1 configuration and split across two cabins. The cabin feels incredibly spacious, thanks to the lack of overhead bins in the middle of the plane.

The more intimate forward business-class cabin only has five rows of seats. The main business-class cabin is double the size, with 10 rows of seats. I'd definitely choose a seat in the forward cabin in the future for its privacy.

If you're flying alone, I'd do everything in my power to select a window seat, though a couple would find the middle seats great. There is a small privacy partition that extended between the middle seats for pairs of strangers.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 Aisle seat 0 1 2 3

The seats themselves are stunning. I particularly liked how the colors alternated between beige and brown. To add more privacy, the window and middle seats are slightly staggered from each other.

The leather seats definitely gave me boardroom vibes, but they were slightly more uncomfortable than a plush office chair.

At 28 inches wide, these are some of the widest business-class seats in the industry. But though the seats are wide enough to fit two average people, the footwell is incredibly small. Furthermore, because of the cabin configuration, the footwell is misaligned with the seat, meaning that you have to either sleep diagonally or in a fetal position.

I'm about 5 feet, 10 inches, and I had issues getting comfortable while sleeping or relaxing. If you're tall, you'll definitely want to choose a bulkhead seat, which has unobstructed footwells.

If the bulkheads are taken, you might want to consider another routing, since you may have trouble sleeping on the 18-and-a-half-hour flight.

There is a legrest that can be raised to 180 degrees, but the seat itself doesn't recline that much. When it's time for bed, flight attendants convert your seat into a bed by flipping the seat over, kind of like a Murphy bed.

Once in bed mode, you can't raise the seat to watch TV or get more comfortable. The bed is incredibly wide, but the sleeping surface noticeably hard. Singapore used a thin mattress pad that didn't help soften the seat.

There is also an uncomfortable diagonal seatbelt that you needed to wear while sleeping when the sign belt sign was illuminated.

The seat has plenty of storage. There is a narrow shelf for sliding in books, computers, iPads and papers. There is also an enclosed compartment to the right of the TV above the cup holder.

Just below the cup holder is a small mirror. There is another enclosed storage compartment on the armrest, which is where I found a bottle of water and the provided headphones.

The self-explanatory seat controls are on the armrest closest to the aisle.

The other nice thing about the seats is the variety in lighting choices. It's nice to be able to simulate an office environment when the cabin lights are dimmed. There are three lights to the left of the seat, one to the right and one above the seat. (There aren't any personal air nozzles next to the overhead light, though).

When it'a time to eat or work, the tray table can be extended from the armrest adjacent the window. The 20-inch-wide and 14-inch-long tray table is massive and can be raised or lowered. The tray table also swivels for easy egress during meals.

There are four standard-size bathrooms for the 67 business-class passengers. There was never much of a line, and the bathrooms were kept pristine throughout the flight.

Overall, the seats definitely look prettier than they are comfortable. The seat and bed are quite hard, the footwell is tiny and awkwardly positioned, and the seat doesn't recline much. Though the oversized width compensates for some of the seat's flaws, I'd still prefer a reverse-herringbone seat over the ones Singapore installed on the Airbus A350-900ULR.

Singapore's Airbus A350-900ULR operates some of the world's longest flights, so you'll be happy to hear that there's plenty of content to keep you occupied during your journey. KrisWorld, Singapore's inflight-entertainment system, had over 300 movies and 700 TV shows. Of the movies, about 20% of them were new releases like ""The Lion King,"" ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" and ""Toy Story 4."" If you're a frequent traveler, you'll be thrilled to learn that Singapore rotates many of their movies on a monthly basis. In November, Singapore offered 79 new movies on board.

Aside from random TV episodes, there were 49 full seasons of TV shows, including HBO classics like ""Big Little Lies"" and ""Game of Thrones,"" as well as dramas like ""Billions"" and ""This Is Us.""

There was also a robust game and music library on KrisWorld. With all the content, I didn't miss the lack of live TV — and I almost didn't miss the tailcam.

The moving map was high-quality and highly customizable.

Although the content selection itself was impressive, the actual TV screen was not. The high-definition TV screen measured 18 inches wide and tilted slightly downward to make it easier to watch TV in bed (though it still wasn't particularly comfortable).

Unlike most other cutting-edge entertainment systems, Singapore's was not touchscreen. Like a toddler, I found myself stupidly pressing the screen for a few minutes before realizing that I needed to use the remote instead.

Bring your own pair of headphones (AirPods Pro in my case), since the sound quality of the unbranded active-noise-canceling headphones Singapore provided was just OK.

For a flight so long, it's important to be connected to home, but Singapore dropped the ball on inflight connectivity. Wi-Fi, provided by Panasonic, was available throughout the flight. Note, however, that most flights on this route go via the North Pole, where there's no satellite connection. To take advantage of favorable winds, though, we proceeded via Europe, so we had a Wi-Fi signal the entire flight.

Business-class passengers got 100 MB of free Wi-Fi, and any additional data cost extra. Singapore charges based on usage, as opposed to time, which is really frustrating. I purchased a 200 MB package of Wi-Fi for $15.99, and I was through with the pass within 30 minutes. Expect a hefty bill if you're looking to stay connected for most of the flight.

Furthermore, the speeds themselves weren't great. I measured 779 ms of ping and 1.46 Mbps download. The upload test repeatedly failed.

There is a universal power outlet, a 0.5 A and 1.0 A USB port as well as iPod (really!) and HDMI connectors.

In terms of amenities, Singapore takes a different approach from most other carriers: They don't offer traditional amenity kits. Instead, there were low-quality slippers, socks and an eye mask waiting at my seat during boarding.

If you wanted traditional amenities, they were in the bathrooms. The lavs were stocked with single-use mouthwash, toothbrushes, shaving kits, combs and hairbrushes. There was also a shared bottle of eau du toilette, facial mist and hand lotion made by the British perfume house Penhaligon's in each restroom.

Flight attendants came through with a toiletries bag about midway through the flight. The bag had Laundress fabric freshener and fabric wrinkle remover, as well as hand cleanser, lip balm and a 1-quart Ziplock bag for toiletries. It was definitely a nice touch, but I missed the traditional amenity kit.

There was one plush pillow on the seat during boarding. Flipping the seat into bed mode revealed two other similarly sized pillows, as well as a thin mattress pad and duvet. While the mattress pad and duvet were of average quality, I loved that Singapore gave three plush pillows. It made all the difference in getting somewhat comfortable on the otherwise hard bed.

With over 18 hours in the air, you're bound to get hungry at some point. Fortunately, Singapore's menu is exhaustive, and the food actually tastes good.

Once I got seated, the flight attendant serving my aisle came through with a tray of predeparture drinks. Singapore didn't serve liquor on the ground, but I knew I'd have plenty once airborne, so I selected the coconut pineapple agua fresca — definitely a refreshing way to start the voyage.

As we were on our climb out, I browsed the menu for the flight. Singapore outlines the dining schedule in the menu, and I was happy to see that there was a meal right after departure, as well as a second meal on demand anytime between eight and 16 hours into the flight. Refreshments were always available on demand after the first meal service was completed.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 12 Menu - Page 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

Aside from the extensive inflight menu, Singapore also offers its Book the Cook service, which allows you to select from nine off-menu main courses at least 24 hours before your flight's departure. I was quite satisfied with what was being served on the inflight menu, so I made all my selections on board.

Once we hit our initial cruising altitude, flight attendants came through taking drink and meal orders. I had the famous Singapore sling, which was served alongside warm nuts.

Lunch began shortly thereafter with a green salad, which was served with smoked salmon and avocado picked at a farm just days before our departure.

From the breadbasket, I took some of Singapore's famous garlic bread and a sesame pretzel roll to accompany my meal.

The main was served about 90 minutes after takeoff. The baked, cheese-herb-crusted halibut filet was a tad too tough. At least the vegetable medley and potato side were delicious.

Once my main was cleared, I had a choice of cherry ice cream or mocha mousse cake for dessert. I had the cherry ice cream, a refreshing treat to end my meal.

Lunch didn't fill me up. I hadn't eaten breakfast in the lounge, so I was still hungry. Fortunately, I had lots of time to try many of the refreshment options on board.

I started by perusing the snack basket. I took SunChips and nuts, which satisfied my salt craving. But then I started craving something sweet, so I raided the snack basket again, this time for a bag of Tate's cookies, a Hershey's cookies-and-creme bar and an unbranded package of peas and crackers.

The snacks held me over for a few hours. Although I wasn't totally hungry yet, I ordered more food, all in the name of research.

The two refreshments I tried were the tikka masala wrap and vegetarian rice noodles. Both were excellent, but I preferred the rice noodles. The wrap was served warm, and my only complaint was that I would've preferred naan instead of a traditional wrap. I have no complaints about the rice noodles — they simply hit the spot.

I fell into a brief food coma before being woken up about nine hours into the flight by the cabin lights. At this point, the crew was preparing to serve the second meal.

Just like all the other food I'd had thus far, this meal was delicious. The smoked trout appetizer was light and refreshing.

I had the steamed cod filet with fried soybean crumbs as my main, and it sure didn't disappoint. The cod was flaky and tender, and the spicy Asian noodles added kick to the otherwise bland fish.

There was a choice of chocolate cake or apple pie for dessert, but I was so full at this point that I chose neither.

Singapore did a fantastic job curating an exhaustive menu for the world's longest flight. Not only was I spoiled for choice, but everything I ate was delicious, too.

When flying with Singapore Airlines, you're either going to have a good crew or a great one. On my flight, we had the latter.

From the moment I stepped aboard, I was referred to as ""Mr. Griff"" for the entire flight. Throughout the flight, the flight attendants checked on me every 20 minutes and offered snacks at each hour during the night. During the meal services, the crew was proactive about drink refills and removed my tray the minute I finished my food.

When the crew wasn't roaming the aisles, it only took them three minutes to respond to the call button.

In terms of service flow, it was interesting that the first meal was served on trays from trolleys while the second meal was placed directly on the tray table. I don't really have a preference for how the meal is served, especially since the service took about one and a half hours either way.

The crew also did a great job of catering to passengers' sleeping schedules. Some passengers went right to bed after takeoff, but the crew kept their lunches waiting for them if they wanted it when they woke up. The flight attendants were incredibly flexible about mixing and matching courses as well, and I heard one passenger request a lunch appetizer for dinner.

After experiencing 18 hours of Singapore's legendary service, it was clear to me how the carrier continually wins awards for the best airline service.

Overall impression

So would I do it again? Absolutely — and that's not just the AvGeek in me talking.

SQ21 is a really special flight. Aside from the title of the world's longest flight, the dining experience and service are so good that you may not want to get off the plane when you land.

The biggest issue with the flight was the seat itself. Though the seat is oversized compared to competitors, it's not comfortable for relaxing or sleeping, especially if you prefer a soft mattress or have trouble sleeping at an angle.

My recommendation? Do whatever you can to select a bulkhead seat on this flight. If you can't, rest assured knowing that there's enough IFE content to keep you entertained for multiple trips from New York to Singapore. But if you're a particularly sensitive sleeper, it may make sense to seek an alternative routing with a more comfortable seat.

To understand the magnitude of this response, the number of “pop-up” coronavirus crisis management teams created across the Airbus businesses is 10-times that of any previous situation, according to Craig Morton, who has been with Airbus for 16 years and is directing – together with Andreas Hermann and the newly-arrived Claire Nurcombe – the COVID-19 Enterprise Crisis Management Team.

Extraordinary, motivated people

“We are extremely fortunate to have extraordinary people with a very strong sense of purpose and commitment,” Morton explained. “I am very sincere in saying that the can-do approach from everybody involved demonstrates Airbus values.” He takes this opportunity to send a word of thanks to them all for their dedication in supporting the company’s response.

There is a sense of motivation, mutual confidence, solidarity and complete trust among the crisis management teams now in action, which spans the full range of Airbus businesses, nationalities and locations around the globe.

- Craig Morton, Director of the COVID-19 Enterprise Crisis Management Team

In describing the business impact of a large-scale crisis such as the coronavirus, the Scottish Morton compares it to jumping into the North Sea in winter. “There’s initial shock from the freezing water: eventually you begin to recover and swim, but you need to get through that initial shock, confusion and even danger. Crisis management is there to support through those critical moments.”

Morton led the effort in activating and even establishing the Airbus crisis management teams where necessary, which was followed by real-time leadership on how to structure the response, establishing guidelines (particularly in preventing the virus’ spread), and providing assistance in managing the situation as it evolved.

Turning the focus to Airbus business continuity

Airbus’ focus is naturally turning to business continuity led by the functions, another key part of the company’s resilience. Using the North Sea comparison again, Morton said Airbus is “now back swimming in rough seas…and so we switch to support, looking out for further obstacles and helping to stay on course until calmer waters.”

Andreas Fehring, a group executive with more than 30 years of experience at Airbus in programme and operations management, has taken on the interface role between the crisis management teams and Airbus’ Executive Committee.

As liaison with the Executive Committee, I am able to bring individual subjects to the table, look for solutions, and quickly decide on assisting the crisis management teams around the world in taking measures to cope with the situation.

- Andreas Fehring, Airbus Group Executive

Fehring said the focus – first and foremost – has been on Airbus employees: ensuring their health and safety, while synchronising protection efforts across the company. As the situation began to stabilise, this expanded to implementing the business continuity actions, ensuring Airbus’ role as a key supplier to the air transport sector; defence, security and law enforcement customers; as well as in space operations.

“We also have a role to play in a larger scope: helping countries in which we live and work as a responsible corporate citizen,” he added. “This is the motivation behind such efforts as our airlift flights that are making millions of face masks available for health personnel and caregivers, along with the 3D production of visor frames for protective masks, and a consortium effort to produce medical ventilators.”"
"No Body to Kick, No Wings to Clip: The Airbus Settlement and Corporate Criminal Liability - RUSI Analysis","Wed, 01 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ydXNpLm9yZy9leHBsb3JlLW91ci1yZXNlYXJjaC9wdWJsaWNhdGlvbnMvY29tbWVudGFyeS9uby1ib2R5LWtpY2stbm8td2luZ3MtY2xpcC1haXJidXMtc2V0dGxlbWVudC1hbmQtY29ycG9yYXRlLWNyaW1pbmFsLWxpYWJpbGl0edIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As it unfolds, the Airbus corruption saga will offer yet another opportunity to reflect on whether wrongdoers are all too often able to hide behind corporations for which they work.

Amid the turmoil of the coronavirus epidemic, Airbus’s multi-jurisdictional settlement of bribery charges for €3.6 billion in January may, in the scheme of things, prove to be a small dent in the finances of a company which now has to contend with a catastrophic fall in demand for air travel. For anti-corruption enforcement, though, this is a remarkable case – and not only by virtue of being the largest-ever bribery settlement, but also because it underscores the challenges of ensuring that the right person pays the price for corporate wrongdoing.

The Airbus enforcement action arises from allegations of bribes paid across multiple countries and continents, including in China, Latin America, the Middle East and Russia. Payments were allegedly arranged through intermediaries engaged by Airbus to win overseas contracts. In 2014, Airbus commenced a far-reaching internal review of its business practices. A year later, UK Export Finance (UKEF), the UK’s export credit agency, requested additional information on Airbus’s due diligence in relation to intermediaries. In 2016, Airbus and UKEF jointly reported the matter to the Serious Fraud Office (SFO).

These facts are laid out in Dame Victoria Sharp’s judgment, which approves the deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) between Airbus and the SFO. Under its terms, Airbus paid €990,963,712 to the SFO to avoid criminal prosecution. Similar settlements were also reached with US and French authorities, bringing the total amount payable in three countries to €3.6 billion, compared with €3 billion in net income earned by Airbus in the 2018 financial year. In contrast to the US DPA, which contains an acknowledgement by Airbus that the Department of Justice’s allegations are ‘true and accurate’, the UK judgment does not state that Airbus formally admits the facts presented by the SFO.

If justice was measured in moneys collected by governments, this would be nothing but a resounding success. Yet it is doubtful that, for now, justice has been done. The US Department of Justice’s filings detail a litany of alleged wrongdoing by Airbus executives, such as ‘funnel[ing] payments to business partners from bank accounts not directly affiliated with Airbus’ to conceal bribery. According to Sharp’s judgment, criminality at hand was ‘grave’ and ‘endemic in two core business areas within Airbus’.

The Individual, or the Corporation?

Corporate culture is a factor to be reckoned with, but even though companies too can face criminal liability, ultimately all crimes are committed by people – and sometimes very well-compensated ones. It is right, therefore, that the joint letter from Spotlight on Corruption and Transparency International UK – two leading anti-corruption NGOs – notes the ‘public concern that in order to ensure that DPAs are not seen as an easy way out for companies, senior executives should face penalties where they have run a company that engages in such wrongdoing’.

The choice – or balance – between individual and corporate criminal liability is fraught with difficulties. As counter-intuitive as it may seem, bringing successful prosecutions against men and women can be more difficult than going after corporations. Someone whose livelihood or even liberty is on the line is likely to contest the allegations more vigorously than a company would. And although one might expect that a company’s admission of incriminating facts would allow for the easy prosecution of the individuals involved, this is far from the truth.

US prosecutors learned this lesson the hard way in 2007 when criminal charges against 13 out of 16 KPMG executives on trial collapsed spectacularly despite the firm’s prior admission of criminal tax fraud. In early 2019, the SFO caused a furore by declining to pursue criminal charges against Rolls Royce executives following an almost £500- million corporate settlement related to bribery in Africa, Asia and Russia. As for Airbus, the SFO is currently considering possible individual prosecutions.

The need to enforce personal accountability is wholly uncontroversial, and there is no reason to doubt the SFO’s commitment to this principle. One can sympathise, however, with the difficult decisions that its director Lisa Osofsky may have to take, particularly since dedicating resources to Airbus-related prosecutions will inevitably divert them from other worthwhile targets. Although second-guessing such critical resource choices is always easier than making them, there is no doubt that public confidence in the justice system would be best served by mounting vigorous prosecutions against those (allegedly) culpable.

The Real Significance of the Case

What the Airbus case tells us about corporate criminal liability is more controversial. Much ink has been spilled in discussions of the UK’s legal framework, which generally only makes a company criminally liable for the acts of those who are its ‘directing mind and will’. Under the UK’s Bribery Act 2010, however, a commercial organisation can be guilty of failing to prevent bribery by an associated person, and this is the provision that enabled the charges against Airbus.

One of the principal considerations in the High Court’s ratification of the DPA was that, simply put, Airbus of today was no longer the same organisation that had orchestrated a worldwide bribery scheme. As Dame Victoria Sharpe put it in her Approved Judgment:

Airbus has changed its management team ... None of the new Executive Committee or Board of Directors is implicated in the conduct set out in the Statement of Facts. The Board of Directors is largely a different board … from that which presided over Airbus during the indictment period. The SFO has confirmed it has no evidence that the current Executive Committee members knew of the corrupt practices or culture of Airbus … Since 2015 [Airbus] has parted with sixty three of its top and senior management employees.

The fluidity of corporate life will be well-known to anyone who returns to a place of former employment years later, to find few if any familiar faces. And, in this instance, wholesale personnel renewal is a positive step. But if we accept that Airbus’s corporate culture has already undergone radical change, what purpose is served by penalising the company now?

Compare this with society’s typical treatment of offenders, which assumes that it is as a result of sanction and censure that they will be reformed. One might argue that fines will incentivise innocent shareholders to oversee their companies more closely – but there seems to be little knowledge on whether this incentivisation works.

The artificiality of prosecuting corporations is encapsulated in the 18th century Lord Chancellor Edward Thurlow’s phrase that they have ‘no body to kick, no soul to damn’. Corporations can be fined or, in extreme cases, debarred or dissolved, but it is not always the wrongdoer who suffers the economic impact.

In short, the key question that resurfaces as a result of the Airbus settlement is whether we, as society, are sufficiently adept at looking behind the corporate veil and ensuring that the right people – that is, the wrongdoers – bear the economic brunt of law enforcement action. If forcing a company to pay helps achieve that objective, then whether it is done as a criminal, civil or tax measure seems to be of little weight. Likewise, whether someone’s guilty mind can be ascribed to their employer is less important than ensuring they cannot hide behind a corporation to escape the fallout from their actions.

As the Airbus saga unfolds, it will become evident whether it can truly leave a lasting mark in anti-corruption enforcement or will be yet another temporary holder of the largest-ever bribery settlement award.

Airbus Helicopters maintains Racer's pace despite delays | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Thu, 09 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLW1haW50YWlucy1yYWNlcnMtcGFjZS1kZXNwaXRlLWRlbGF5cy8xMzc4MzguYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters insists that its Racer high-speed technology demonstrator is still on track to meet a revised first flight deadline of late 2021, despite some development items lagging behind schedule.

Under the company’s previous schedule, the Racer was due to perform its maiden sortie in 2020.

Part of the EU’s Clean Sky 2 programme, the Racer is a compound helicopter design featuring twin pusher propellers mounted on V-shaped box-wings.

In an article on the Clean Sky website, Brice Makinadjian, Airbus Helicopters chief engineer for the Racer effort, says that the development of the main gearbox is one of two items that are running late. However, he stresses that this should have no impact on the overall programme, which passed its critical design review (CDR) milestone last year.

“The first one is the main gearbox, where we are a bit late in terms of maturity of the design – we are not yet at the CDR level – but there is no impact on the global development of the demonstrator.

“This is because we have secured the external interfaces of the main gearbox so that we can progress the development of the whole aircraft – the gearbox will come later in the assembly,” he says.

The other item is the lateral drive line, which links the main gearbox with the lateral gearbox to drive the propeller at the end of each wing.

Balance tests of the component were carried out in 2019, while fatigue and endurance tests “to check that we can rely on this design for the test campaign” will follow this year, says Makinadjian.

Nonetheless, major structural sections are currently being produced by Airbus Helicopters’ partners across the continent.

In Romania, INCAS and Romaero – both headquartered in Bucharest – are constructing the fuselage, while Aernnova and Airbus Helicopters in Spain are manufacturing and assembling the tail boom in order to begin static testing.

“The fuselage will be delivered to our factory in the middle of 2020, and we will then officially start the Racer’s assembly sequence,” says Makinadjian.

He anticipates that from mid-2020 it will take around 12 months to obtain the necessary flight clearance for the helicopter, leading to a maiden sortie in the fourth quarter of 2021.

Airbus Helicopters is additionally constructing a mission demonstrator for the Racer in order to “stimulate the market”.

If the market response is positive, this could spur the manufacturer to launch a full commercial development based on the Racer’s technology, says Makinadjian.

Under Clean Sky rules, demonstrator aircraft funded by the programme can only be taken to technology readiness level 6 – short of full industrialisation.

Airbus Helicopters hopes the 7-8t-class Racer can achieve a cruise speed of around 220kt (407km/h).

It will be powered by twin Safran Helicopter Engines Aneto-1X powerplants, one of which can be shut down – and rapidly restarted – in forward flight to cut fuel consumption. This will allow the helicopter to meet ambitious environmental targets, which require 20% lower emissions of CO2 and NOx.

Airbus Helicopters has previously indicated that the Racer would require around 200h of flight testing."

Airbus has conducted maiden flight testing of its A400M new-generation airlifter ordered by the Luxembourg Armed Forces.

The move serves a key milestone before its scheduled delivery to the Luxembourg military.

In its maiden flight, the aircraft, known as MSN104, took off from Seville in Spain and remained airborne for five hours before landing back on site.

The A400M airlifter is scheduled to be delivered in this quarter.

Once delivered, the aircraft will be operated by a binational unit of Belgium and Luxembourg in the former country.

According to the Airbus website, the A400M is designed to carry strategic loads for deliveries to theatres of operations.

Capable of delivering payloads of up to 37t, the aircraft can be used to carry paratroopers, heavy vehicles, equipment and other cargo.

Furthermore, the A400M can be used in refuelling missions.

Overall, the aircraft has a maximum range of around 8,900km and can operate at a maximum speed of 0.72 Mach.

The aircraft assembly works are carried out in Spain while the wings and fuselage are built at the UK and Germany respectively.

The French Air Force inducted the first A400M aircraft in 2014. Since then, Airbus has delivered a total of 88 units.

Last year, the company carried out the A400M airlifter’s first air-to-air refuelling contacts with a helicopter in southern France.

Recently, Airbus also noted to have adapted wing production activity in the plants in the UK and Germany due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic."
Turning Airbus A320 passenger plane to cargo - AeroTime,"Sat, 04 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjQ3NzEtdHVybmluZy1haXJidXMtYTMyMC1wYXNzZW5nZXItcGxhbmUtdG8tY2FyZ2_SAVlodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZXJvdGltZS5hZXJvL2FydGljbGVzLzI0NzcxLXR1cm5pbmctYWlyYnVzLWEzMjAtcGFzc2VuZ2VyLXBsYW5lLXRvLWNhcmdvL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The ongoing coronavirus pandemic and subsequent crisis have accelerated passenger aircraft groundings at an unprecedented pace. However, some airlines, like Etihad Airways, striving to sustain at least some part of their operations, turned to repatriation or cargo flights – using passenger planes in both cases.

In the light of this change, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has recently certified a new option for airlines to modify the interior of their Airbus A320 family jets for goods transportation.

The EASA-certified Cargo Seat Bags, launched by Colibri Aero and J&C Aero, allow for commercial and humanitarian cargo transportation inside A319, A320, A321 passenger cabins. The solution is currently available only for Airbus A320 jets, but a version for Boeing is coming too, according to the companies.

The Cargo Seat Bag allows for transporting up to 252 kg (555 lb) cargo per a triple seat block, including postal correspondence, household goods, electronics, medical equipment, and other. The kits are developed in compliance with Structural Integrity, Fire Protection, and Emergency Evacuation requirements, according to the company’s statement.

Aircraft operators are provided with a cargo bag special condition compliance justification matrix, a loading manual and additional documentation required by their national aviation authorities (CAA). The MOD kit documentation may also be supplemented with an EASA Form 1.

“[…] While the passenger traffic has drastically fallen, many airlines keep operating their passenger aircraft for cargo deliveries – both ordinary goods and medical equipment like masks, respirators, and other items. Being able to promptly apply temporary modifications for passenger cabins for cargo purposes may allow aircraft operators to increase cargo capacities thus adapting operations to the growing demand for cargo air deliveries between countries and regions,” said Andrius Norkevičius, the CEO of Colibri Aero"
"Airbus, Rolls-Royce halt development on E-Fan X electric aircraft - PaxEx.Aero","Mon, 27 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vcGF4ZXguYWVyby9haXJidXMtcm9sbHMtcm95Y2UtaGFsdC1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1vbi1lLWZhbi14LWVsZWN0cmljLWFpcmNyYWZ0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The initial goal was a hybrid-electric aircraft demonstrator embarking on its first flight in 2021. The new reality is that the E-Fan X project has been scrapped. Rolls-Royce and Airbus pulled the plug on the joint development effort late last week.

[I]t has become clear to both parties that the actual requirement to carry out a test flight with all the elements integrated is not critical at this time. As an aircraft, E-Fan X was always designed to be a demonstrator only and never for actual use as a product in service. – Rolls-Royce Chief Technology Officer Paul Stein

In announcing the move Airbus Chief Technology Officer Grazia Vittadini suggests that Airbus is not satisfied with the incremental change that the E-Fan X demonstrator would deliver. Instead the company wants to “take an even bolder approach to reduce CO2 emissions.” Realizing the decarbonization of flight “is no small feat,” says Vittadini, requiring Airbus “to re-focus all of our efforts on technology bricks that will take us there.” The E-Fan X project is not one of those technology bricks.

Building on the success of the E-Fan flight in the first half of the decade, the E-Fan X planned to incorporate a 2 megawatt motor into a four engine BAe 146/Avro RJ 100, replacing one of the gas-powered engines. An on-board power generation system and battery pack would deliver the “fuel” for the motor, allowing the aircraft to operate normally, though with lower emissions.

Should a new project come along that requires electric propulsion, Rolls-Royce believes it is ready to fly. In announcing the program termination Chief Technology Officer Paul Stein was optimistic of that future potential, “[O]ur power generation system can and will be integrated into any future aircraft that is developed requiring a hybrid-electric propulsion system, including a comprehensive flight-test programme to ensure that all industry safety requirements are met.” That no such development program is on the books matters little, perhaps, with the promise being made that it will work just fine if needed.

Although E-Fan X will not take to the skies, I strongly believe that its spirit will live on as we continue on our journey towards climate-neutral flight. – Airbus Chief Technology Officer Grazia Vittadini

Reduced motivation to deliver climate-neutral flight

Delivering on the promise of reduced emissions in aviation is something of a moon shot. There are no easy pathways and no obvious shortcuts. It will be an expensive proposition, one that requires massive support from all sectors of the aviation industry, as well as governments. That support existed in small pockets, often reluctantly granted, until the beginning of this year. The incremental cost to the new sustainable fuels was vaguely tolerated, for example, but only in small quantities while awaiting larger production volumes and the associated reduction in unit costs. But companies were willing to invest in that production capacity.

What a difference a global pandemic grounding nearly all passenger air travel can make.

Fuel prices cratered. This is a short-term effect, at least right now, but delivering long-term implications. The incremental spend to reduce emissions is now dramatically larger. And it comes against the backdrop of drastically reduced revenues for the airlines. Airlines that were once keen to show their commitment to the environment through such spending have new priorities now.

Balking at the CORSIA commitments

Not only are the airlines balking at the costs of lower-emission fuels, but discussions about reducing the commitments made via the CORSIA scheme are now occurring. Again, the cost of compliance is at the forefront.

Some airlines are using the crisis to ground their oldest and least efficient aircraft in favor of newer planes in the fleet as they come out of hibernation. Other airlines don’t have that broad a range of aircraft to ground or retire. Nor do they have the funds to buy new, more efficient models.

Shifting gears in a big way

One interesting hint in Vittadini’s comments came as she discussed the successes of the program. Among them, she described the development of “New pathways for disruptive CO2 reduction” including “…inquiry into new technology pathways. Hydrogen being one of them, which is equal parts a huge opportunity as it is a new challenge.”

Will the previous focus on electric propulsion pivot to hydrogen systems? Batteries are spectacularly heavy and, despite recent improvements, still hard to bring on board in a volume that supports more than a very short flight on a very small plane. Hydrogen promises a higher energy density, perhaps as much as 10x greater in the near term.

So maybe it will be hydrogen. Maybe it will be sustainable alternative fuels. Maybe it will be something we don’t yet know. But seeing two industry leaders bail out on such a highly visible program at this point is hard to see as a positive, regardless of the spin applied.

Airbus and Rolls-Royce cancel E-Fan X hybrid-electric RJ100 experiment - Flightglobal,"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mbGlnaHRnbG9iYWwuY29tL2Fpci10cmFuc3BvcnQvYWlyYnVzLWFuZC1yb2xscy1yb3ljZS1jYW5jZWwtZS1mYW4teC1oeWJyaWQtZWxlY3RyaWMtcmoxMDAtZXhwZXJpbWVudC8xMzgwNjcuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus and Rolls-Royce have axed the E-Fan X demonstrator programme, a year before the experimental hybrid-electric engine airliner was supposed to fly.

The E-Fan X programme was launched to explore electric aviation and involved equipping a BAE Systems Avro RJ100 with a hybrid engine.

But Airbus chief technology officer Grazia Vittadini says that the airframer is having to “navigate the realities” of a world impacted by the coronavirus crisis, and concentrate on priorities.

She says Airbus and Rolls-Royce have “jointly decided”, as a result, to “bring the E-Fan X demonstrator to an end”.

“As with all ground-breaking [research] projects, it’s our duty to constantly evaluate and reprioritise them to ensure alignment with our ambitions,” adds Vittadini.

“These decisions are not always easy. But they’re undoubtedly necessary to stay the course.”

She points out that the effort to decarbonise the aviation industry is “no small feat”, adding: “To achieve this, we need to re-focus all of our efforts on technology bricks that will take us there.”

The E-Fan X, launched in 2017, was due to carry out its maiden flight in 2021.

Vittadini insists that, while the aircraft will “not take to the skies”, the effort invested in the programme has not been wasted.

“To say we’ve learned a lot from this demonstrator project would be an understatement,” she says.

“Over the past three years, each successful E-Fan X milestone has offered us rich insights for the future.”

Vittadini says these include exploration of hybrid architecture, batteries and high-voltage systems, and new carbon dioxide reduction technologies, as well as certification and regulatory knowledge. She adds that Airbus has developed a “more focused roadmap” on progressing with decarbonisation.

“As with all such leading-edge programmes, we constantly evaluate the best way forward and it has become clear to both parties that the actual requirement to carry out a test flight with all the elements integrated is not critical at this time,” says Rolls-Royce chief technology officer Paul Stein.

He says the level of industry interest and support for the E-Fan X programme has been “particularly encouraging”.

“Although our programme with Airbus concludes, we are planning that our power-generation system ground testing will complete, allowing us to demonstrate the technology and capture all the lessons.”"

It feels like years ago at this point, but in the days before ""social distancing"" entered the global lexicon — just over a month ago — I went on vacation.

It was early March, as the coronavirus outbreak was spreading and getting worse, but before we knew anything that we know today. It was before the virus was running rampant through New York and the US at large — or at least, before hospitals began seeing a surge and before testing was available enough to confirm the spread. At the time, we thought nothing of concepts like flattening the curve and social distancing.

My wife and I had been planning a huge vacation to South Africa for more than a year. Even though travel is one of the most important things to both of us, and we're lucky to have traveled a lot, this trip was going to be a special one, and a major item knocked off of our lifetime bucket lists.

So, based on what we knew at the time, we decided to leave for the trip, calculating a relatively low risk to us and others (again, this was before we knew what we know now). Part of our motivation was the fact that we'd invested a lot into the trip, compared to what we normally spend when traveling, it was nonrefundable, and since there were no travel bans and we were both healthy, our travel insurance would not cover anything if we canceled.

Advertisement

As part of the trip — really the impetus for it — we had booked our flights to and from South Africa in Qatar Airways' business class using American Airlines miles. Qatar's groundbreaking ""QSuite"" product has been widely acclaimed as the world's best business class, and I was incredibly eager to try it.

Ultimately, we weren't able to finish the two-week trip. After five days on the ground, the COVID-19 outbreak had dominated hearts and minds across the globe. The situation had gotten significantly worse in New York and the US, and so many airlines had canceled routes that we weren't sure we'd be able to get home.

Then South African officials announced a new travel ban that included Americans. We had to get back to the states.

We booked an emergency flight home, and while we were disappointed we couldn't finish our vacation, we've been working with our travel agent to get credits to use later for the parts we couldn't enjoy. Now, we have a trip to look forward to once this pandemic is behind us.

Advertisement

I've been torn over filing a flight review while we're all social distancing and none of us — aside from essential workers — can fly, even though the review is from a flight we took before this all began.

However, I decided that even while we stay distant from each other and watch the world as we know it change, possibly forever, it's worth remembering what we have to look forward to when we emerge from this.

I've been incredibly fortunate to fly with a ton of different airlines, in a ton of different seats and cabins, both for my job, and for fun. Based on my own past experiences, I can confidently say that Qatar's business class is, indeed, unique, and deserving of the accolades it has received.

Here's what it was like flying the world's best business class on the Airbus A350-1000 from JFK in the days before the coronavirus outbreak reached pandemic proportions."
