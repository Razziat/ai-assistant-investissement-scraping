CityAirbus NextGen makes its debut - Airbus,"Thu, 07 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyNC0wMy1jaXR5YWlyYnVzLW5leHRnZW4tbWFrZXMtaXRzLWRlYnV00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Donauwörth – Airbus has presented its full electric CityAirbus NextGen prototype to the public, ahead of its maiden flight later this year. The two-tonne class CityAirbus, with a wing span of approximately 12 metres, is being developed to fly with an 80 km range and to reach a cruise speed of 120 km/h, making it perfectly suited for operations in major cities for a variety of missions.

The unveiling coincided with the opening of the new CityAirbus test centre in Donauwörth, which will be dedicated to testing systems for electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles (eVTOLs). The centre, which is part of Airbus’ ongoing and long-term investment in Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), began its operations with the CityAirbus NextGen’s power-on in December 2023 and it will be now used for the remaining tests required before the prototype’s maiden flight later in the year. These tests cover the electric motors with their eight rotors as well as the aircraft’s other systems such as flight controls and avionics.

“Rolling out CityAirbus NextGen for the very first time is an important and very real step that we are taking towards advanced air mobility and our future product and market. Thank you to our community, team and partners all over the world for helping us make this a reality,” said Balkiz Sarihan, Head of Urban Air Mobility at Airbus.

At the same time, Airbus is expanding its global network and partnerships to create a unique ecosystem that will foster a successful and viable AAM market. Airbus recently signed a partnership agreement with LCI, a leading aviation company, to focus on the development of partnership scenarios and business models in three core AAM areas: strategy, commercialisation and financing.

Airbus widens aircraft delivery lead over Boeing as Max crisis deepens - CNBC,"Tue, 12 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDMvMTIvYm9laW5nLWZlYnJ1YXJ5LW9yZGVycy1haXJidXMtd2lkZW5zLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWRlbGl2ZXJ5LWxlYWQuaHRtbNIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDI0LzAzLzEyL2JvZWluZy1mZWJydWFyeS1vcmRlcnMtYWlyYnVzLXdpZGVucy1haXJjcmFmdC1kZWxpdmVyeS1sZWFkLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing handed over 27 airplanes to its customers last month as it continues to struggle with quality control problems and production delays that have frustrated the CEOs of some of its biggest airline customers.

So far this year, Boeing has handed over 54 planes, while Airbus has widened its lead over its main rival, delivering 79 planes in the first two months of 2024.

Delayed Boeing planes have been difficult for airline leaders. Southwest Airlines , which flies only Boeing 737s, on Tuesday said that it would trim capacity plans this year because of fewer Boeing Max deliveries and that it will have to reevaluate its 2024 financial estimates. United Airlines earlier this year said it was taking the 737 Max 10, which hasn't yet been certified, out of its fleet plans.

Boeing's February deliveries included 17 Max jetliners and seven wide-body 787-9 Dreamliners. Deliveries are important to manufacturers because customers pay the bulk of the aircraft's price when they receive the plane.

Boeing logged 15 gross orders for new planes in February, while Airbus sold just two. And customers aren't abandoning Boeing because of its recent struggles. Last week American Airlines announced an order for 260 narrow-body airplanes split between Boeing, Airbus and Embraer.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9999990463256836}",negative,0.9999990463256836,-1

Orders enable American to upgauge aircraft on domestic and short-haul international routes and offer more premium seats than any other U.S. airline.

American expects to remain within its previously announced guidance for capacity and capital expenditures inclusive of the aircraft orders.

With growing customer demand for a premium travel experience, American will retrofit its A319 and A320 fleets beginning in 2025, increasing the number of domestic first class seats on each aircraft.

Narrowbody orders complement existing orders of Boeing 787-9 and Airbus A321XLR long-haul aircraft.

FORT WORTH, Texas — American Airlines today announced orders for 260 new aircraft, including 85 Airbus A321neo, 85 Boeing 737 MAX 10 and 90 Embraer E175 aircraft. The orders also include options and purchase rights for an additional 193 aircraft. As part of the Boeing order, American has upgauged 30 existing 737 MAX 8 orders to 737 MAX 10 aircraft.

The orders are part of American’s continued investment to expand premium seats across its narrowbody and regional fleets and support the long-term strength of the airline’s domestic and short-haul international network.

“Over the past decade, we have invested heavily to modernize and simplify our fleet, which is the largest and youngest among U.S. network carriers,” said American’s CEO Robert Isom. “These orders will continue to fuel our fleet with newer, more efficient aircraft so we can continue to deliver the best network and record-setting operational reliability for our customers.”

Since 2014, American has taken delivery of more than 600 mainline and regional aircraft. With this announcement, American has 440 aircraft on order, extending its aircraft order book into the next decade so the airline can continue to meet the growing demand for air travel.

“We are very pleased to continue our longstanding partnerships with Airbus, Boeing and Embraer with these orders,” said American’s Chief Financial Officer Devon May. “As we look into the next decade, American will have a steady stream of new aircraft alongside a balanced level of capital investment, which will allow us to expand our network and deliver for our shareholders.”

Measured narrowbody fleet growth

The aircraft orders support American’s measured growth into the next decade and smooth the delivery schedule in the coming years. Accounting for these orders, American expects to remain within its previously announced guidance for capacity and capital expenditures.

For the past decade, the A321 and A321neo aircraft have flown American’s customers across the U.S. and to short-haul international destinations. American continues to be the largest single-carrier operator in the world of A320 family aircraft.

“The continued investment in the A321neo is a testament to the unprecedented value of the world’s most versatile and capable single-aisle aircraft,” said Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, EVP Sales, Commercial Aircraft, Airbus. “For nearly two decades, American Airlines has used its A320 family of aircraft, some of which have been produced in the U.S. in Mobile, Alabama, to grow its domestic and short-haul international network and provide an exceptional experience for its passengers and crews.”

American is planning for the future with the new order of 737 MAX 10s and looks forward to certification of the aircraft. The airline currently operates the 737 MAX 8 and the addition of the 737 MAX 10 will allow American to continue to upgauge its fleet and provide more flexibility across its network.

“We deeply appreciate American Airlines’ trust in Boeing and its confidence in the 737 MAX family. American’s selection of the 737-10 will provide even greater efficiency, commonality and flexibility for its global network and operations,” said Stan Deal, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. “Our team here at Boeing is committed to delivering on this new order and supporting American’s strategic growth with one of the industry’s largest and most modern fleets.”

Upgauged regional fleet

American is focused on bringing larger, dual-class regional aircraft into its fleet, which will continue to drive connectivity from smaller markets to the rest of the airline’s global network. The airline expects to retire all of its 50-seat single-class regional jets by the end of the decade and will continue to serve small and medium-size markets with larger regional jets.

Dual-class regional jets with premium seating, high-speed satellite Wi-Fi and in-seat power are expected to make up American’s entire regional fleet upon completion of the Embraer E175 deliveries. The new E175 aircraft will be operated by American’s wholly owned regional carriers.

“The E175 is truly the backbone of the U.S. aviation network, connecting all corners of the country,” said Arjan Meijer, CEO of Embraer Commercial Aviation. “One of the world’s most successful aircraft programs, the E175 was upgraded with a series of modifications that improved fuel burn by 6.5%. This modern, comfortable, reliable and efficient aircraft continues to deliver the connectivity the U.S. depends on day after day. This represents American’s largest-ever single order of E175s, and we thank American for its continued trust in our products and people.”

Enhancements to existing aircraft

To serve customers’ growing demand for a premium travel experience, American will be retrofitting its A319 and A320 aircraft beginning in 2025. The retrofit will refresh the interior with power at every seat, larger overhead bins and new seats with updated trim and finish.

American’s A319 fleet will be outfitted with more premium seats for a total of 12 domestic first class seats. The A320 fleet retrofits will increase the aircraft’s domestic first class seat count to 16.

With the planned refresh of existing aircraft and the expected deliveries of new aircraft, premium seating in American’s fleet is expected to grow by more than 20% by 2026.

"China Positioning C919 Passenger Jet to Take On Boeing, Airbus - Voice of America - VOA News","Thu, 14 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvNzUyODMzMS5odG1s0gEoaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm9hbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wLzc1MjgzMzEuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"China’s state-owned plane manufacturer is facing industry skepticism over its claims that its newest passenger aircraft, the C919, can break the passenger-jet duopoly of Boeing and Airbus.

COMAC’s promotional tour through the fast-growing aviation markets of Singapore, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Indonesia ended in Malaysia on Wednesday, according to China’s official Xinghua news agency. At each stop, the Shanghai-headquartered enterprise presented its C919 to potential buyers as a viable alternative to the Airbus 320 and Boeing 737.

International and regional tourism is expected to reach, then surpass pre-pandemic levels in many Southeast Asian countries this year, according to analysts who cautioned that subsequent growth may hinge on China’s economy making a full recovery.

The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) expects the demand for passenger aircraft in the Asia-Pacific market to increase over the next two decades from 3,314 to 9,701 planes, according to Chinese state media.

But Skift, a travel industry research site, quoted the executive chairman of Air Lease, one of the largest aircraft lessors in the world, saying the company isn’t planning to buy any C919 jets.

“The CCP [Chinese Communist Party] and COMAC are very interested in selling the C919,” said Steven Udvar-Hazy at the aviation industry’s Wings Club in New York on February 29. “But it’s a one-way dating relationship.”

Brendan Sobie of Sobie Aviation, an aviation industry consultancy in Singapore, told CNBC, “It’s still early days to know if COMAC can shake up the duopoly. … We are not likely to see a C919 overseas order of significance in the near term.”

As the C919 tour progressed, COMAC said its goal was to showcase the aircraft and lay “the groundwork for future market expansion in Southeast Asia.”

The C919 is certified only by the Civil Aviation Administration of China, which approved it in September 2022. The narrow-body jet entered commercial service with China Eastern Airlines last year in May.

COMAC says it has more than 1,000 orders for the C919, but most of those are from Chinese airlines and aircraft lessors. At the Singapore Airshow, COMAC took orders from Tibet Airlines, a Chinese entity, for 40 C919 single-aisle planes. Boeing and Airbus planes are sold out through the end of the decade, according to Bloomberg.

China has said it wants to secure broader international recognition for the C919 and plans on pursuing European Union Aviation Safety Agency certification.

Boeing and Airbus executives say they’re not worried about the aircraft that was shown for the first time outside China at the Singapore Airshow February 20-25.

The C919 is “not going to rock the boat in particular,” Christian Scherer, chief executive officer of Airbus’s aircraft commercial business, said at a media roundtable on the sidelines of the industry event.

Scherer added the C919 was a “legitimate effort” by China but is “not very different” from the Airbus and Boeing aircraft.

Dave Schulte, Boeing’s commercial marketing managing director for Asia-Pacific, said airlines in Southeast Asia may consider ordering C919s, according to Barron’s.

However, he warned that COMAC will face the same supply-chain disruptions as Boeing and Airbus as post-pandemic demand for air travel increases. Assembled in China, the C919 relies heavily on components, including engines, from companies outside China such as GE and Honeywell International.

After Singapore, COMAC took the C919 to Vietnam from February 26-29 for its own airshow followed by a two-week progression of shows in Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia and Indonesia.

Tan Wan Geng, COMAC’s board chair, described Vietnam as an important international aviation center in Southeast Asia and predicted increased exchanges and cooperation between his operation and Vietnam's aviation industry.

In Singapore, Tibet Airlines ordered 10 ARJ21 jets, the C919’s smaller predecessor, and China's Henan Civil Aviation Development and Investment Group ordered six ARJ21s.

Cambodia's State Secretariat of Civil Aviation Undersecretary of State and spokesman Sinn Chanserey Vutha said last week that Cambodia supported the entry of C919 and ARJ21 jets into the aircraft market.

""This is a good sign for the aircraft market,"" he told China’s official Xinhua while attending the demonstration flight event.

Nguyen Thien Thong, a leading expert in aviation engineering in Vietnam, told VOA Vietnamese in a February 28 telephone interview that it is unlikely that airlines in Vietnam will purchase or lease the COMAC aircraft in the near future.

The founder of the Aviation Engineering program at Van Lang University said that adding one more airline supplier to their current fleets of Airbus and Boeing would complicate maintenance, management and operations while increasing costs.

“I don’t think it is effective,” added the former head of the Aviation Engineering Department at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology.

Udvar-Hazy, the Air Lease executive chairman, pointed to a lack of support infrastructure needed to make the C919 commercially viable in international markets, according to Skift. He added the Chinese jet also lacks technical support training.

“Without that,” he said, “there’s no export market.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998056292533875}",neutral,0.9998056292533875,0

It includes a commentary on the year 2023, as well as a review of the commercial aviation safety record evolution over the previous decades.

The 2023 edition of A Statistical Analysis of Commercial Aviation Accidents reveals some good news. No fatal accidents and no hull losses were recorded in commercial aviation last year even though air traffic increased by 20% compared to 2022, reaching more than 32 million flights.

This confirms a long-term trend; the commercial aviation industry has achieved huge improvements in safety over recent decades. It also underlines how technology contributes to improving safety when taking a flight in a commercial jet aircraft.

The safety record for 2023 is a good result. However, it is important to remember that statistics for one year are not always indicative of the overall safety trends. This analysis uses accident rates calculated as a 10-year moving average to provide a more consistent trend.

Safety is a never-ending effort and preventing accidents is a constant quest for all those involved. This is why the runway collision between an A350 and a Dash-8 turboprop aircraft that occurred on 2 January 2024 in Tokyo, which claimed the lives of 5 people on board the Dash-8, is also mentioned in this 2023 edition. It is a stark reminder: we need to avoid the trap of complacency and remain vigilant in the reinforcement of all safety barriers to prevent accidents.

This new mission of NASA and the German Space Agency at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) will strengthen the more than 20 year long partnership between the USA and Germany to ensure uninterrupted measurement of the Earth's gravity field, which started in 2002 with GRACE and continues with GRACE Follow-On, launched in 2018.

During its five year nominal mission lifetime, the GRACE-C Mission (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment-Continuity) will continue the series of measurements observing how Earth’s groundwater, oceans, ice sheets, and land shift, month-to-month, by measuring changes in the planet’s gravity field.

Alain Fauré, Head of Space Systems at Airbus, said: “It is amazing to think that, without looking down at Earth, two satellites more than 200 km away from each other, can tell us how quickly our ice sheets are melting. In environmental monitoring, continuity is key. The valuable data provided by the previous GRACE missions is testament to their success and it is great news that Airbus continues to be part of this international mission providing the tools to measure how our climate is evolving.”

GRACE-C consists of two identical satellites flying around 200 km apart at an orbit altitude of 500 km with an inclination of 89 degrees. Each satellite will measure approximately 3 x 2 x 1 metres and weigh around 600 kg. Launch is planned no earlier than late 2028 from the USA.

Like its predecessors, the GRACE-C mission is designed to precisely measure small distance changes between the satellites due to gravity variations, with an unprecedented precision down to the micron. As the pair of satellites circle the Earth, areas of slightly stronger gravity (greater mass concentration) will affect the spacecraft’s positions and hence the distance between them. The extremely precise microwave ranging system will detect these changes and enable the mapping of Earth’s gravity field with unmatched accuracy.

Over the months and years, the comparison of these gravity maps, or the evolution of mass concentrations, will enable scientists to assess the global water balance, including groundwater tables and ice sheets, and the influence of climate change. It will also provide insights into deep and surface currents in oceans and ocean height contributors.

GRACE-C is a rebuild of the two GRACE Follow-On satellites with upgraded avionics based on state-of-the-art technology and the joint US-German Laser Ranging Interferometer (LRI), already flown on GRACE Follow-On as an experimental payload, now being the main ranging instrument.

The mission is based on a NASA/DLR interagency partnership: German contributions are funded by the Federal German Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action as well as the Federal and Ministry of Education and Research. The optical bench of the LRI instrument is built by SpaceTech GmbH in close cooperation with the Max Planck Institute Gravitational Science (Albert Einstein Institute).

Airbus Defence and Space in Friedrichshafen will design, build and deliver the satellites to the launch site, including Launch and Early Orbit Phase (LEOP) support for NASA/JPL. The mission will be operated by the German Space Operations Center (GSOC) of DLR.

GRACE-C – a successful series of missions to observe Earth’s environment continues

GRACE-C is a joint mission of the US space agency NASA and the German Space Agency at the German Aerospace Center (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt; DLR). The German contribution is being realised with funds from the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz; BMWK) and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung; BMBF). This is supported by contributions from other project partners on the German side. The GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam (GFZ) will be responsible for the scientific evaluation of the mission data and the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute) together with the company SpaceTech GmbH in Immenstaad for the construction of the laser system to measure the distance between the GRACE-C spacecraft

“Over the past decade, we have invested heavily to modernise and simplify our fleet, which is the largest and youngest among U.S. network carriers,” said American’s CEO Robert Isom. “These orders will continue to fuel our fleet with newer, more efficient aircraft so we can continue to deliver the best network and record-setting operational reliability for our customers.”

“The continued investment in the A321neo is a testament to the unprecedented value of the world’s most versatile and capable single aisle aircraft,” said Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, EVP Sales, Commercial Aircraft, Airbus. “For nearly two decades, American Airlines has used its A320 Family of aircraft, some of which have been produced in the U.S. in Mobile, Alabama, to grow its domestic and short-haul international network and provide an exceptional experience for its passengers and crews.”

American Airlines took delivery of its first A321neo in February 2019, and 70 have been delivered as of January 31, 2024. The airline is the world's largest operator of A320 Family aircraft, the world’s largest A321 operator (CEO and NEO) and the largest customer for the A321neo in North America.

The A321neo is the largest member of Airbus’ A320neo Family, offering unparalleled range and performance. By incorporating new generation engines and Sharklets, the A321neo brings a 50% noise reduction and more than 20% fuel savings and CO₂ reduction compared to previous generation single-aisle aircraft, while maximising passenger comfort in the widest single-aisle cabin in the sky. To date more than 6,100 A321neos have been ordered by more than 90 customers across the globe.

40 years of A320 Family innovation - Airbus,"Wed, 20 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDI0LTAzLTQwLXllYXJzLW9mLWEzMjAtZmFtaWx5LWlubm92YXRpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The 40th anniversary of the A320 programme, launched in March 1984, is a great time to pay tribute to the A320 Family and look back over four decades defined by confidence, boldness, innovation and, above all, success!

Over the past half-century, Airbus has gone from humble outsider to world leader in aeronautics. The company owes its success in large part to a programme that has grown steadily over the decades to become the ultimate benchmark in its category: the A320 Family.

When the A320 was launched, the programme counted 80 orders from five companies including British Caledonian and Air France. Over the years, the A320 and its subsequent variants the A318, A319, A321 and the game-changing neo (New Engine Option), have consistently demonstrated versatility, fuel efficiency and attractive range, making the programme a preferred choice among customers. Indeed, the A320 Family order book today stands at 18,460 aircraft (end of February, 2024) making it the world's best-selling commercial aircraft.

Customers continue to place their confidence in the A320 Family. 2023 saw the figures increase once again: more than 1,800 aircraft were ordered by customers worldwide. This figure, the largest ever registered in a single year, included 500 A320 Family aircraft for Indian airline IndiGo alone, which made history with this record order.

The A320 family’s stunning success can be attributed to a number of factors. Over the years Airbus, its suppliers and partners have successfully mobilised the know-how, skills and passion of a growing number of people, at an increasing number of production sites around the world. Final assembly lines in Tianjin (China) and Mobile (Alabama, USA) have joined Toulouse and Hamburg to meet growing customer expectations in terms of deliveries.

Forty years of A320 Family innovation

The A320 programme incarnates four decades of continuous improvement and bold innovation, from advanced avionics to Sharklet wingtips and the Airspace cabin. One of the A320 Family’s most revolutionary features is its pioneering use of fly-by-wire (FBW) technology. Introducing a digital control system to replace conventional manual flight controls was a technological leap forward that enables smoother aircraft handling, increased efficiency, and enhanced aviation safety.

The 2010 decision to re-engine the A320 Family made the New Engine Option a significant development not only for Airbus but the commercial aviation sector as a whole. Offering improved fuel efficiency, reduced emissions, and lower operating costs, the neo became an overnight best-seller. Airbus now counts over 10,000 A320neo orders on its books, way more than originally expected.

These neo orders include 550 A321XLRs. The A321XLR, the latest member of the family, is due to enter into service in 2024. It's another game-changing aircraft: able to connect more people on more routes more efficiently than any other single-aisle aircraft flying today it will reshape long-haul travel and play a pivotal role in the evolution of commercial aviation.

The urgent need to decarbonise economies and societies, and aviation in particular, means the A320 Family is sure to play a key role into the future. Burning 20 to 30% less fuel than previous generation aircraft, each neo that is delivered paves the way towards a lower carbon future.

Preparing the future

The next decade will be decisive for Airbus. The company will develop a hydrogen-powered airliner and a fuel- and CO2-efficient successor to the A320 simultaneously. This will require considerable resources, for which the A320 Family will be the major contributor. This will probably be the iconic aircraft’s last, but not least, contribution to the future of the aeronautical industry it has shaped so profoundly since 1984.

Stay tuned for more news of the A320 Family.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999997615814209}",positive,0.9999997615814209,1

Now Atos faces the challenge of bringing the two halves back together with what Saleh calls a coordinated go-to-market strategy while it considers other strategic options.

Saleh hasn’t ruled out looking for another buyer.

Back in January Atos said that another company was interested in buying just part of its big data and security business, but it has said nothing more about that while a deal with Airbus was still on the table.

For now, the company would only say: “Atos is analyzing the resulting situation and actively evaluating strategic alternatives that will take into consideration the sovereign imperatives of the French state.”

That last remark is an allusion to criticism of its now-failed deal with EPEI, controlled by a Czech billionaire, on national security grounds. Atos holds numerous contracts with the French Ministry of Defense.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8540855646133423}",neutral,0.8540855646133423,0

United did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

At a J.P. Morgan conference this week, United CEO Scott Kirby said he was glad was glad that Boeing was taking the time to fix safety and quality issues as it deals with the fallout of a January door plug blowout on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9. But he also expressed a bit of impatience.

“We are in the market,” for Airbus’s 737 Max rival, he said. “And if we get a deal that the economics work, then we’ll do something.” It looks like the company is going to do something.

Boeing has long struggled to build all its customers’ ordered planes on time. In 2022, Ryanair CEO Mike O’Leary told investors that Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun needed “a boot in his arse” to speed things up.

Flights of fancy

United had really been counting on the next-generation 737 Max planes. During an October earnings call, chief commercial officer Andrew Nocella said the airline has “a significant fleet of 777 and 767 that need to retire at some point later this decade.”

When the manufacturer announced United’s 737 Max 10 order in 2017, the company said it would deliver the planes in 2020. It’s now 2024, and the plane hasn’t even been cleared to fly by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Last week, United executives told staff in a memo announcing a pilot hiring freeze that they had no idea if the planes would ever come.

“Those aircraft aren’t even certified yet, and it’s impossible to know when they will arrive,” vice president of flight operations Marc Champion and vice president of flight operations planning and development Kirk Limacher wrote.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.994595468044281}",neutral,0.994595468044281,0
"American Airlines to buy 260 new planes from Boeing, Airbus and Embraer to meet growing demand - The Associated Press","Mon, 04 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2FtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLXBsYW5lcy1haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLWVtYnJhZXItMzYzYzE2YTk0N2IwM2YwYjg1MDQ1YzJmNWIxYTg0ODXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DALLAS (AP) — American Airlines announced a massive order for new planes on Monday, splitting 260 new aircraft between Boeing, Airbus and Embraer in a move designed to meet growing travel demand and increase the airline’s supply of premium seats.

American said it placed options for up to 193 more planes over the next several years.

The airline and aircraft-makers did not disclose financial terms for the orders.

The package of orders includes 85 Boeing 737 Max 10s — a larger version of the Max that has not yet been certified by U.S. regulators. The plane is already years behind schedule, and United Airlines — which has 277 on order — removed the Max 10 from its plans, at least temporarily.

Boeing is under intense scrutiny by the Federal Aviation Administration to fix problems in its manufacturing system, particularly since a panel blew off an Alaska Airlines Max 9 in midflight in January.

American gave the U.S. plane-maker a vote of confidence, however, even converting a previous order for 30 Max 8s to the larger Max 10s.

It also ordered 85 A321neo planes from Airbus, Boeing’s European rival. The A321 and Max 10 are about the same size.

The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline also ordered 90 smaller E175 aircraft from Brazil’s Embraer.

The planes are all single-aisle, so-called narrow-body aircraft that American will use for flights within the United States and to nearby international destinations. In a presentation for analysts Monday, American called its short-haul network “the foundation of value for customers and investors.”

American CEO Robert Isom said the airline has invested heavily in the last decade — more than 600 planes, including those used by its regional affiliates — to modernize and simplify its fleet, which is already the largest among U.S. carriers.

“These orders will continue to fuel our fleet with newer, more efficient aircraft so we can continue to deliver the best network and record-setting operational reliability for our customers,” Isom said in a statement.

American now has orders for 440 planes, some of which aren’t scheduled to be delivered until next decade.

American is joining rivals Delta Air Lines and United Airlines in chasing premium passengers. American said it will retrofit its current Airbus A319 and A320 jets with power outlets at every seat and more first-class seats.

Those upgrades and new planes will help American increase the number of premium seats in its fleet by more than 20% by 2026. That is key to the airline’s strategy: American said Monday that members of its frequent-flyer program and other customers who buy premium seats will account for 80% of company revenue this year, up from 70% in 2017.

American announced the aircraft order — which had been widely expected — a few hours before an investor day meeting with Wall Street analysts in New York.

American executives did not update their January forecast of first-quarter and 2024 earnings. They said capital spending on aircraft will rise from $1.9 billion last year to $2.3 billion this year and to between $3 billion and $3.5 billion per year to 2030.

Shares of American Airlines Group Inc. fell more than 5% by the end of regular trading.

Airbus officials say this expansion is representative of growing customer demand. The hangar is next to the Mobile Regional Airport. The new building adds 17,000 square feet bringing the total size of the facility to 62,000 square feet.

Airbus U.S. Space and Defense CEO and Chairman Rob Geckle says the focus at the Airbus U.S. Military Aircraft facility is component and maintenance repair.

""We do everything from avionics overhauls to refurb and repairs and this allows us to do larger aircraft and expand our capacity for support and sustainment,” said Geckle.

According to Geckle 140 to 150 employees work at the facility and the new hangar means they are looking to hire more people. Jose De La Fuente is the head of U.S. Military Aircraft for Airbus U.S. Space and Defense. He says the workforce has doubled in the last three years for Airbus’ defense operations.

""We've been hiring a lot of resources in engineering mechanics to do the different works and repairs for integration in the aircraft,” said De La Fuente.

Mobile Chamber of Commerce CEO Bradley Byrne says this expansion means more opportunities for what Mobile can offer in terms of aviation business.

""We truthfully can tell people when we go to recruit businesses here that we do everything in aviation,” said Byrne. “We do not just do commercial work. We do defense and space work as well. So, as they grow here, we're growing our opportunities to bring more people here to be in that business.""

This expansion not only benefits business in Mobile but also the Mobile Regional Airport.

""This is part of the future of the mobile regional airport,” said Mobile Airport Authority Executive Director Chris Curry. “When most people ask what are we going to do with the mobile regional airport we're going to continue to still own and operate it because of projects like this.""

According to Geckle, Mobile is the fourth largest aerospace manufacturing city in the world.

Airbus Soared Higher

Airbus enjoyed a successful year, surpassing its 2022 performance. It set three new industry records: the highest gross orders of 2,319 jets, the highest net new orders of 2,094 aircraft, and the highest backlog of 8,598 jets by the end of 2023. This performance was primarily driven by the strong demand for its A320neo family of narrowbody aircraft, particularly the fuel-efficient A320neo and A321neo variants.

In terms of deliveries, the European manufacturer managed to deliver 735 aircraft by December 2023, solidifying its position as the industry leader in terms of commercial aircraft delivery in 2023.

Boeing Faced Challenges

Despite Boeing securing a new company record backlog of 6,216 jets by the end of last year, it still faced delivery delays due to supply chain disruptions and ramp-up challenges for the Boeing 737 MAX production.

While it managed to deliver 528 aircraft in 2023, it fell short of Airbus’s delivery numbers. However, the American manufacturer remained optimistic, expressing confidence in its ability to bounce back in the coming years.

Air India’s Combined Order for 470 Planes

In February last year, Air India (AI) ordered 470 jets, including 250 Airbus jets and 220 Boeing planes plus 70 options. The agreement includes 140 A320neo and 70 A321neo single-aisle aircraft as well as 34 A350-1000 and six A350-900 wide-body jets.

The deal with Airbus for 250 aircraft is valued at around US$37 billion based on the list prices for the most popular model variants, even though airlines tend to receive steep discounts on such mega deals.

In addition to the large Airbus order, Boeing and AI ordered 220 Boeing aircraft, comprising 190 Boeing 737 MAX, 20 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, and 10 Boeing 777X airplanes. The deal also includes options for 50 Boeing 737 MAX and 20 Boeing 787-9 airplanes.

This historic order with Boeing is valued at $34 billion at current list prices. Although the exact number of aircraft in each variant isn’t confirmed yet, the 190 Boeing MAX aircraft will be split between the Boeing 737-8 and 737-10 variants.

Following the confirmation of this order, Air India became the 11th customer for the yet-to-be-certified flagship Boeing 777X jet.

“Air India is on a large transformation journey across safety, customer service, technology, engineering, network and human resources. Modern, efficient fleet is a fundamental component of this transformation. These new aircraft will modernise the Airline’s fleet and onboard product, and dramatically expand its global network. The growth enabled by this order will also provide unparalleled career opportunities for Indian aviation professionals and catalyse accelerated development of the Indian aviation ecosystem.” Tata Sons and Air India Chairman, Mr N Chandrasekaran

The first of the new batch of aircraft has already entered service, with the bulk of these aircraft scheduled to arrive in mid-2025. In the meantime, AI has already started taking delivery of 11 leased Boeing 777 and 25 Airbus A320 family aircraft to accelerate its fleet and network expansion.

Emirates, flydubai’s Orders for Airbus A350, Boeing 777X/787

On the first day of the Dubai Airshow, Emirates (EK) opened the order book with a significant order for 95 additional wide-body aircraft, taking its total order book to 295 aircraft.

The Dubai-based carrier ordered 90 Boeing 777X, including 55 777-9 and 35 777-8 jets in a deal valued at $52 billion at list prices. This order has boosted Emirates’ Boeing 777X family backlog to 205 aircraft. EK will be inducting new Boeing 777-9s to its fleet until 2035.

In addition to the Boeing 777X Order, EK updated its Boeing 787 Dreamliner order book by placing orders for five additional jets, thus growing its Boeing 787 backlog to 35 aircraft. EK has increased its commitment to 35 Dreamliners comprising 15 Boeing 787-10s and 20 Boeing 787-8s.

Emirates was one of the first airlines to order the Boeing 777X, signing up for 150 jets during the Dubai Airshow in November 2013. The order was finalized in July 2014 and included 50 additional options for the twin jet.

During last year’s Dubai Airshow, EK also ordered 15 Airbus A350-900s in a deal valued at US$ 6 billion at the list price. This takes EK’s A350 order book to a total of 65 units. The first A350 is scheduled to join Emirates’ fleet in August 2024, and with these additional orders, it will continue to receive A350 deliveries until early 2028. Despite wide speculations, the Dubai-based carrier didn’t order the larger A350-1000 variant at last year’s Dubai Airshow.

On top of the Emirates order, flydubai (FZ) also ordered its first widebody aircraft at the airshow. The low-cost carrier ordered 30 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners to be delivered in 2026 in a deal valued at US$11 billion. FZ plans to use the Boeing 787s to open new routes and grow capacity on existing routes.

Riyadh Air, Saudia, Up to 121 Boeing 787 Dreamliners

In March, Saudi Arabia’s new national airline Riyadh Air (RX) ordered 39 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, with options for an additional 33 aircraft. In addition, Saudi Arabian Airlines (SV) also announced the growth of its long-haul fleet with the addition of up to 49 Boeing 787 Dreamliners.

According to Boeing, the state-owned carrier SV ordered 39 Boeing 787s split between 787-9 and 787-10 models and has an option for another ten aircraft. The two national carriers decided to purchase up to 121 Boeing 787 Dreamliners. All of these aircraft will be fitted with General Electric Co. engines. The deal is valued at almost US$37 billion at list prices.

“Saudia continues its expansion efforts in all aspects of the airline; whether introducing new destinations or increasing the aircraft fleet. The agreement with Boeing delivers on this commitment, and the newly added aircraft will further enable SAUDIA to fulfill its strategic objective of bringing the world to the Kingdom.” His Excellency Engr. Ibrahim Al-Omar, Director General of SAUDIA Group

This deal also marked Boeing’s fifth-largest commercial order in terms of value and will significantly contribute to Saudi Arabia’s objective of serving 330 million passengers and attracting 100 million visitors by 2030.

Air France-KLM Ordered up to 90 A350 Aircraft

In September, Air France – KLM Group ordered 50 Airbus A350-900 and A350-1000 aircraft, with purchase rights for 40 additional aircraft. Deliveries of these A350s will begin in 2026 and continue through 2030. The Airbus A350s will eventually replace the Airbus A330s and older Boeing 777 aircraft across the group’s airlines.

According to Reuters, the decision to order additional Airbus A350s came after an intense competition between Airbus and Boeing, with support from engine manufacturers. The group’s fleet planners faced the challenge of balancing considerations such as range, size, and cost as they sought to replace their Airbus A330 jets and a significant portion of the group’s aging Boeing 777s.

“This new order will be a major step in the renewal of the Group’s fleet. The Airbus A350 is a state-of-the-art aircraft with an excellent track record at Air France, where it has rapidly become a favorite among passengers and crew since its entry into service in 2019. It is the perfect fit for the network needs of the Group and boasts outstanding performances.” Air France-KLM CEO Benjamin Smith

In addition to these large orders, Airbus and Boeing secured tens of orders for their narrowbody and widebody aircraft throughout the year. Both manufacturers bagged significant orders from the Paris and Dubai Airshow in 2023.

December Orders

Airbus secured orders for a record 807 jets (gross orders) from 16 customers in December. However, the company also faced 108 cancellations, including seven A320ceos, seven A321ceos, 34 A320neos, eight A330-200s, eight A330-300s, 28 A330-900s, and 16 A350-1000s. This resulted in a total of 699 net new orders for the month of December.

Also in December, easyJet (U2), a major UK-based low-cost carrier, placed a firm order for 153 A320neo family aircraft, comprising 52 A320neo and 101 A321neo aircraft.

Shifting focus to Boeing’s December performance, the company received orders from eight customers totaling 371 jets (gross orders). Boeing reported two Boeing 787 cancellations and logged 369 net new orders. Boeing’s December order was dominated by a large Boeing 737 MAX order for 156 aircraft and an order for 45 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, both placed by an undisclosed customer.

Financial Performance, Other Developments

Financially, Airbus and Boeing reported positive results in 2023 compared to 2022. Airbus reported a net profit of €3.789 billion and revenue of €65.4 billion, while Boeing reported a revenue of USD 77.794 billion and a net loss of US$2.2 billion. Despite the loss, Boeing’s financial performance showed improvement compared to 2022, reflecting its ongoing recovery efforts.

Production issues continued to pose challenges for Boeing, particularly regarding the Boeing 737 MAX and Boeing 787 program. While the company ramped up production to meet demand, it still faced supply chain constraints and hiccups related to the return of the usual delivery of these aircraft types after the grounding.

On the other hand, Airbus managed to navigate production challenges more effectively, maintaining a steadier pace of deliveries throughout the year. This and its solid order activity solidified Airbus’s position as the leading commercial aircraft manufacturer in 2023.

Airbus Future Outlook

Looking ahead, the future of the commercial aviation industry appears cautiously optimistic. The significant order activity in 2023 indicates airlines’ confidence in the long-term growth of air travel.

Airbus is continuing its manufacturing ramp-up efforts for the A220 program, aiming to achieve a monthly production rate of 14 aircraft by 2026. Emphasis is being placed on enhancing the program’s industrial maturity and financial performance. Meanwhile, progress is being made on the A320 Family program, with production advancing steadily towards the previously announced rate of 75 aircraft per month by 2026.

Construction commenced on the second A320 Final Assembly capacities in Tianjin (China) and Mobile (US), while the new A320 Family Final Assembly Line in Toulouse delivered its inaugural aircraft in December 2023. Also that month, the first customer A321XLR aircraft entered the Final Assembly Line, with its entry-into-service slated for Q3 2024.

Regarding widebody aircraft, the European manufacturer is moving forward with plans to achieve a monthly rate of four aircraft for the A330 in 2024 and a rate of 10 aircraft for the A350 by 2026.

Boeing Future Outlook

Boeing maintains transparent cooperation with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) following the Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 incident involving a Boeing 737-9 MAX aircraft. The manufacturer is implementing immediate measures to enhance the quality of its Boeing 737 program, including additional inspections within its factory and at key suppliers. It also supports expanded oversight from airline customers and temporarily paused its narrowbody production for one day to refocus its employees on quality.

The American manufacturer has appointed an external expert to lead a comprehensive independent assessment of Commercial Airplanes’ quality management system, directly providing recommendations to Calhoun and the Aerospace Safety Committee of Boeing’s Board of Directors. Despite these challenges, the Boeing 737 program continues to deliver airplanes, with its production rate currently at 38 per month. Similarly, the Boeing 787 program maintains a production rate of five per month.

However, challenges remain, including potential economic headwinds, geopolitical uncertainties, and the ongoing need for supply chain stabilization. To solidify their positions in the years to come, both Airbus and Boeing are expected to focus on further streamlining their production processes, developing new fuel-efficient technologies, and exploring emerging markets.

Fourth Airbus Eurostar Neo satellite delivered

Toulouse, 11 March 2024 – The Airbus-built EUTELSAT 36D geostationary telecommunications satellite has been shipped from Toulouse, France to Sanford, Florida, USA, on board an Airbus BelugaST (A300-600ST). Its next step is the Kennedy Space Center, in Florida, where it will be launched into orbit aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 later this month. With the advent of the new BelugaXL, based on the larger A330-200 platform, the A300-600 based BelugaST fleet is now fully available for outsized freight transport services globally.

EUTELSAT 36D is based on the latest generation Eurostar Neo geostationary telecommunications satellite and will provide TV broadcasting (DTH) and government services over Africa, Europe and eastern countries and has a planned lifetime of more than 15 years.

Philippe Pham, Head of Telecommunications & Navigation Systems at Airbus, said: “EUTELSAT 36D is the latest milestone of our longstanding partnership with Eutelsat stretching back more than 30 years. It is the 22nd geo satellite we have built for them and will provide extended capacity over Africa and Eurasia.”

With 70 physical Ku-band transponders, the all-electric EUTELSAT 36D will assure all the main legacy missions of EUTELSAT 36B, with enhancements to coverage and performance.

It is the fourth Eurostar Neo in orbit. Eurostar Neo satellites combine increased payload capacity and more efficient power and thermal control systems with reduced production time and optimised costs as part of a fully digitalised production process. EUTELSAT 36D combines 18 kW of electric power with a reduced launch mass of approximately five metric tonnes, enabled by Airbus’ EOR (Electric Orbit Raising) capability, reinforcing Airbus’ position as the world leader in electric propulsion.

The Eurostar Neo family of Airbus telecommunications satellites is based on a next-generation platform and technologies, developed with the support of the European Space Agency (ESA), and others, including the Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales (CNES) and the UK Space Agency (UKSA).

This is the third time that a Beluga transport aircraft is delivering an Airbus geostationary satellite to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Previous missions include HOTBIRD 13G on 17 October 2022 and Inmarsat 6-F2 on 30 January 2023.

"Airbus, Boeing And Embraer Begin Defining Next Narrowbodies - Aviation Week","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvYWlyY3JhZnQtcHJvcHVsc2lvbi9haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLWVtYnJhZXItYmVnaW4tZGVmaW5pbmctbmV4dC1uYXJyb3dib2RpZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Across the tarmac from the Singapore Airshow chalets, the aerospace industry’s newest narrowbody airliner was on full display. Four units are already in service and its manufacturer is beginning the challenging work of increasing production and trying to penetrate the global market. The aircraft was Comac’s C919.

The C919 enters a market that has been a duopoly ever since the 1997 merger of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. The only serious attempt at entering the narrowbody market, at least the lower end, finished in financial disaster for Bombardier and a further strengthening of Airbus, which picked up the former C Series program—now called the A220—essentially free of charge. Embraer watched and considered its options for some years before deciding to play it safe, developing the relatively small E-Jet E2 that would neither hurt Airbus or Boeing nor force them to move.

Airbus, Boeing and Embraer study future narrowbodies

Engine architecture, wing and aerodynamics will be key features

Service entry likely after 2035

For one reason or another, Airbus and Boeing never moved ahead with all-new projects at the time. There was little movement, and if anything, Comac was trying to catch up to incumbents, not eclipse them. However, driven primarily by existential sustainability requirements, that era of incremental steps has come to an end.

In recent years, both Airbus and Boeing have begun to talk about successors for the A320neo and 737 MAX—all-new aircraft that they aim to introduce in the second half of the next decade. Given that development cycles have significantly lengthened to close to 10 years, including prelaunch work, the time to kick off serious development efforts is now. The E2 has not become the growth engine that Embraer had hoped for, so the Brazilian manufacturer is again looking at going bigger. Doing so, possibly as Airbus and Boeing move up in the market in terms of aircraft size, could also create a gap at the lower end of the market that Embraer might be able to fill. Furthermore, the JetZero blended wing body (BWB) project targets the same niche addressed by narrowbodies.

Boeing Truss-braced Wing

Boeing’s path to more concrete plans for a next-generation narrowbody has been long and winding. Its customers argue that now is not the time for Boeing to dive into the project. First, the manufacturer must “get their house in order,” Air Lease Corp. CEO John Plueger says.

Nonetheless, Boeing has begun the internal work needed, Darren Hulst, the OEM’s vice president for commercial marketing, said at the recent ISTAT Americas conference in Austin, Texas. “But maybe [we’re] not talking as much about it as Airbus,” he added.

Boeing has built more than 11,700 737s and still holds the crown as the most popular single-aisle jet airliner in history. But the A320, launched 40 years ago, is catching up quickly and will likely overtake its archrival in production terms within the next year or two.

The vast production numbers accrued by the 737 owe as much to its longevity as its flexibility. The original project was given the go-ahead in 1964, long before Airbus even existed and 20 years before the A320 was launched on the back of only 96 orders. For much of the last 60 years, Boeing has looked hard at replacing the 737, but—just as the DC-3 frequently turned out to be the best replacement for the DC-3—the company concluded each time that the 737 was hard to beat and that reengining was the best solution.

When it came to the MAX, however, the decision was far from clear. Just weeks from Boeing’s decision to green-light the MAX in July 2011, even the aircraft’s engine provider, CFM International, was convinced that the airframe manufacturer was going to launch a competitor to the A320neo with an all-new design rather than follow the reengining route with its new Leap 1.

In the weeks leading up to the contest that year for an American Airlines deal that triggered the launch of the MAX—and which Boeing ended up sharing with Airbus anyway—the smart money had been on a clean-sheet design targeted at service entry by about 2020. In April 2011, less than three months before launching the 737NE (New Engine), later renamed the 737 MAX, even Boeing admitted that the results of a reengining survey with operators had been “underwhelming.” In short, most airlines wanted an all-new design.

But the cost and timescale of a new product were too daunting for Boeing’s management while the troublesome 787 program was already badly behind schedule and hugely over budget. During the company’s second-quarter earnings call in 2011, then-Boeing Chief Financial Officer James Bell said the development cost for the airframe portion of a reengining program would be 10-15% of the cost of a new program, estimated at $10-12 billion at the time. Besides, Boeing believed that extending the 737 into a fourth generation would preserve market share—giving it several precious years to prepare a true replacement design.

However, with the benefit of hindsight, Boeing’s 2011 decision to launch the MAX instead of pushing for a more ambitious clean-sheet design was a gamble with massive repercussions for the company and industry. Even without the debilitating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the simultaneous disaster of the MAX accidents in 2018 and 2019, and the subsequent grounding of the aircraft, the decision to proceed with the reengined 737 caused Boeing unparalleled financial and reputational damage.

In a financial filing this past February, Boeing reported having paid $400 million to 737 MAX operators in 2023, after paying $1 billion in 2022. Financial analysts quoted in a Feb. 5 report by The New York Times said the two 737 MAX crashes and the grounding of the fleet for nearly two years cost Boeing a staggering toll of about $20 billion. Even with more than 4,300 aircraft in the current backlog—adjusted for accounting standards—it is unclear that Boeing will make good on the program in the long run.

Having boxed itself into a corner with the MAX and its financial burden, where is the company now in its long-term ambitions for a 737 replacement? The answer lies firmly in the X-66A, an experimental aircraft in development with Boeing as part of NASA’s Sustainable Flight Demonstrator (SFD) project. The slender-winged aircraft, a heavily modified MD-90, is the agency’s first full-scale X-plane focused on helping the U.S. achieve its goal of net-zero aviation greenhouse gas emissions. For cash-strapped Boeing, it is also a golden opportunity to flight-test a sustainable design concept that could form the basis for a single-aisle 737 successor.

The roots of the design, also known as the transonic truss-braced wing (TTBW), go back to 2010, when Boeing’s Research and Technology branch developed different configurations for a Subsonic Ultra-Green Aircraft Research (SUGAR) study with NASA. Inheriting ideas developed during the 2000s-era Yellowstone product development initiative that also spawned the 787, SUGAR evolved into several high-aspect-ratio wing designs, the ultimate outcome of which gave rise to the TTBW.

Now launched as a full-scale demonstrator expected to fly in 2028, the NASA-Boeing program is the company’s best hope of producing an all-new design with the efficiency levels required for service in the late 2030s. Previous 737 successor efforts, most notably the 737RS (Replacement Study), were abandoned in 2008 after all the technologies available generated fuel-burn savings of only about 8%. This figure was well below the 20% level Boeing had set itself against as the baseline performance target for the 737 Next Generation.

Other key factors will come into play as Boeing refines its 737 replacement plan around the technology suite in development for the X-66A. While the SFD aims to primarily prove the aerodynamic benefits of the slender TTBW wing, the configuration is essentially agnostic to the three main next-generation propulsion systems also in development. These include the GE Aerospace-Safran CFM joint venture’s RISE (Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines) open fan technology program, an advanced version of Pratt & Whitney’s PW1000G geared turbofan (GTF) and smaller versions of Rolls-Royce’s very-high-bypass UltraFan. All three initiatives are currently supported by research on both sides of the Atlantic and are targeted at the Airbus and Boeing next-generation, single-aisle aircraft requirements for the 2030s.

Additionally, next-generation studies incorporate Boeing’s involvement in other research efforts, such as NASA’s High-Rate Composite Aircraft Manufacturing (HiCAM) project. Boeing has gained experience in composite fuselage and wing production through the 787 and has taken composite wing production in-house with the 777X program, but the company knows that even more advanced technologies will be needed for future single-aisle manufacturing tempos. HiCAM’s production concepts center on next-generation thermosets as well as resin-infused and thermoplastic composites, and the concepts are aimed at technologies that will enable a production rate increase of 4-6 times without ramping up costs.

Just as important, the TTBW concept is also agnostic to fuselage cross-section and gives Boeing its first chance to adopt a wider, circular or ovoid cabin section. The change could replicate small twin-aisle configurations studied under earlier projects going back as far as the 7J7, a 727/737 replacement featuring propfans and a 188-in.-dia. fuselage evaluated in the 1980s. The 7J7 in many ways represents a bellwether of what could come later this decade if Boeing finally commits to a new narrowbody design.

Against the Grain

Since Airbus’ market share is approaching 70%, conventional wisdom would have it that the OEM should not act at all. But Airbus Commercial CEO Christian Scherer and Airbus Group CEO Guillaume Faury are driving the company in a different direction.

“We are the market leader today,” Scherer told Aviation Week recently. “I am of the opinion that an even higher responsibility develops through that leading market position. We want to be the pioneer of the future. As a market leader, we should not react to the challenger but act ourselves.”

Sash Tusa, an aerospace analyst at Agency Partners, says the game is afoot in the market to develop a next-generation narrowbody aircraft. “Airbus cannot wait for Boeing to launch and credibly get this industry toward net-zero,” Tusa says. “I think there’s a realization now that there will have to be interim aircraft designs.”

Interim designs include a new, likely rather conventional tube-and-wing-shape aircraft featuring the latest in aerodynamic improvements, more efficient propulsion and full use of sustainable aviation fuel.

“That shows the industry is willing and the industry is prepared to keep moving toward net-zero,” Tusa says. “Producing A320s and 737s will attract an increasing amount of political pressure because it would suggest that the industry doesn’t care, and then they might be forced into something they really don’t want.”

What was previously called eAction is now the Next-Generation Single-Aisle (NGSA) project. It was moved into the general Airbus program organization under Philippe Mhun, executive vice president of programs and services, focusing it and the smaller ZEROe hydrogen aircraft on more concrete research and development. Airbus is working toward a service-entry date in the second half of the next decade. Given how long development and certification cycles have become, a launch decision would be required within the next three years.

There are relatively clear indications of what Airbus is looking at in principle, but the more detailed design questions are still wide open. “Strategically, the question is: What will follow the A321? Is it a conventional solution or are we already beginning [to introduce] disruptive technologies?” Scherer asked in his recent Aviation Week interview. “Probably it will be a bit of both. Two or three major innovations should flow into a new aircraft program.”

Consequently, it seems to be all but decided that the A320neo-family successor will start with a bigger baseline aircraft similar in size to today’s A321neo. The potential for a further stretch and possibly a smaller variant remains, although that seems to be a less pressing detail given that Airbus’ portfolio includes the A220, which could fill the gap left by the unwinding of A320neo production. “We need the right strategy, the right timing, and there are tactical considerations,” Scherer said.

Airbus has not revealed much yet about its thinking on what the next narrowbody looks like. “I think it starts at the A321 and goes higher,” Tusa says. “The market clearly wants larger aircraft.” That is not only because of the general upward trend in demand but also because environmental constraints imposed by European governments could lead to slot restrictions at large hub airports. Operating fewer flights with larger aircraft could mitigate the impact to a degree.

Although the size of Airbus’ next narrowbody could be in the 180-240-seat category, its shape largely depends on the engines. Airbus and GE Aerospace have been working closely on the feasibility of incorporating the RISE engine concept into the design of that new narrowbody. “It is going to be a much more challenging engineering process to put those on or under a wing,” Tusa says. Airbus will also ideally have to find an architecture that allows for engine choice even in the—so far likely—case that a competitor does not go for the open rotor idea.

Pratt & Whitney could offer a version of the GTF Advantage or whatever the second generation of its geared fan engine family looks like. Rolls-Royce has made clear that it is seeking reentry into the narrowbody market with its UltraFan technology. The two might join forces, as they have in the past on the International Aero Engines V2500 powerplant.

Wing design is another crucial feature for a next-generation narrowbody, given that it might have to accommodate very different large-diameter engines. A gull wing could be the solution, with the wing root attached to the lower fuselage but immediately rising upward to allow for much greater ground clearance. Wings are also likely to become much longer for higher efficiency, so folding wingtips might be a requirement to fit the aircraft into the existing gate infrastructure and could even be a tool in flight for more efficient cruise.

The question linked to wing design is whether Airbus will retain its dual engine source strategy. Faury and Scherer have said publicly that they prefer for their customers to have engine choice, a situation that would give it easier access to a broader base of airlines. But that comes with challenges, particularly if Airbus selects RISE and if the competing engine were to be a more conventional nacelle-covered powerplant. It would presumably be almost impossible to optimize a wing for both engine types. The question then becomes whether going with a sole source would be less painful than accepting a compromise design.

The NGSA project is not only about the aircraft itself. For Airbus, it is the once-in-a-generation chance to look at and possibly revamp its complicated production system. “We should think about how we could be better organized industrially without necessarily continuing the old Airbus model,” Scherer said. “That should be treated as an open question, the same way as what the aircraft should look like. In any case, one should think about a different industrial setup in which competencies are no longer shared but are more efficiently put together.”

Getting the transition right from the current A320neo family to its successor is a much more challenging task than it was to move from the classic A320 to the reengined version. To build an all-new platform featuring new technologies is difficult enough, but the task must be accomplished at very high rates and without cannibalizing the current product too much.

Airbus aims to put out 75 A320neo aircraft per month in 2026. Although Faury has made clear that the rates are not going to go significantly higher anytime soon after that milestone has been reached, they are not planned to go down either. The only caveats to that planned production rate would be both a shift to help generate the cash flow to fund an expensive development program and simultaneous continued work on a smaller hydrogen-powered aircraft.

Embraer’s Next Steps

Airbus and Boeing are no longer the only ones targeting the future narrowbody market. The C919 is in service, while Airbus picked up Bombardier’s C Series, the only new Western single-aisle challenger since the end of the McDonnell Douglas era. The main question is: What will Embraer do? Before it launched the E2, the Brazilian manufacturer considered going bigger but ultimately decided against it, opting to stay under the radar of Airbus and Boeing for the time being.

As part of the planned commercial venture with Boeing, a role for Embraer in bigger aircraft was conceivable. Its engineers could have taken part in the proposed New Mid-Market Airplane design work; as the new Boeing aircraft moved up in capacity, there could perhaps have been space at the lower end of the narrowbody market to jump into.

Industry sources say an internal debate is ongoing at Embraer discussing future options. One camp sees a window of opportunity now that Boeing might be too weak to fight two fronts at the same time: against Airbus for a share in the big jet market and against Embraer at the lower end. Of course, a larger Embraer commercial jet would compete head-to-head with the A220, which Airbus is positioning as a bridge aircraft for mainline airlines ahead of the introduction of the NGSA. It is not a comfortable place to be in—just ask Bombardier. A more disruptive design eclipsing A220 efficiency could be the solution.

Embraer CEO Fernando Gomes Neto says Embraer plans to make a decision “in a couple of years” about where to put its resources for its next aircraft development program. He sees executive and commercial aviation as possible sectors for the company’s next step.

“Embraer has the capability to do something bigger,” he says. “But we have no plans to do this right now. We understand the opportunities, but I really don’t want to put the company at risk.”

One new potential player that might affect the trajectory of the incumbents’ plans for the sector is California-based JetZero, which in 2023 announced plans to develop a full-scale multirole BWB demonstrator. Although sized for about 250 passengers and targeted at what JetZero says is the underserved middle tier of the market, the configuration is scalable and could be adapted to smaller designs.

Backed by an initial $235 million U.S. Defense Innovation Unit contract and buoyed by potential interest as an airlifter-tanker for the U.S. Air Force, the JetZero concept therefore appears a realistic potential challenger to the duopoly—particularly since airlines are expressing strong interest in the BWB’s advertised sustainability goals. JetZero says the aircraft’s advanced aerodynamics and lightweight structure, combined with high-efficiency engines, could offer 50% lower fuel burn compared with current aircraft in its size class.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.979476273059845}",neutral,0.979476273059845,0

This new Airbus air taxi has a 50-mile range and is quieter than a hairdryer - Electrek,"Fri, 08 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vZWxlY3RyZWsuY28vMjAyNC8wMy8wOC90aGlzLW5ldy1haXJidXMtYWlyLXRheGktaGFzLWEtNTAtbWlsZS1yYW5nZS1hbmQtaXMtcXVpZXRlci10aGFuLWEtaGFpcmRyeWVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has introduced its latest zero-emission eVTOL, designed to carry four people with a noise decibel range lower than a hairdryer when flying – which will radically cut into the noise pollution factor of a futuristic vision of eVTOLs buzzing around busy cities. Nearly five years in the making, this prototype targets a flight range of 50 miles (80 km) and a cruising speed of 75 mph (120 km/h).

Airbus’s latest prototype, the CityAirbus NextGen – unveiled at the opening of its new CityAirbus test center, which will be dedicated to testing systems for eVTOLs, in Donauwörth, Germany – is set to take its maiden flight this year.

The CityAirbus NextGen is an electric lift-plus-cruise vehicle designed for a variety of travel in major cities, including passenger transport, medical services, and ecotourism. Airbus says it will partner with operators and airlines to fly the model worldwide, with plans for it to take flight in Italy, Germany, Norway, and Japan, as well as regions in Latin America.

While at first, the CityAirbus will be flown by a pilot, it’s equipped with an operational automated flight mode that could enable future autonomous flying.

The aircraft, which can reach cruising speeds of 65 knots (about 75 mph) weighs two tons and has a 40-foot wingspan – so it’s by no means a tiny aircraft. It has a V-shaped tail, fixed wings, and a distributed electric propulsion system, with 16 electric power units and eight electric propellers. Back when Airbus introduced the NextGen design in 2021, it promised that these features keep sound levels to below 65 A-weighted decibels (dBA) during fly-over and below 70 dBA during landing – so that’s about the sound of a hairdryer or vacuum cleaner at landing, even less in flight. Perhaps closer to people talking loudly. Of course, Joby Aviation has its own air taxi that is 45.2 dBA when flying overheard, which it says is quieter than a typical conversation.

Electrek’s Take

Airbus is among many companies working on an electric aviation future, including US’s privately held Beta with its sleek CX300, a plane with a 50-foot wingspan, as well as establish players like Boeing and Embraer. In California, the aforementioned Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation, backed by companies like Toyota, Stellantis, and Delta and United Airlines, are both developing battery-powered eVTOLs like Airbus’s. Since today’s batteries can support limited range and weight, these aircraft, for now at least, are designed to just carry a few passengers for short distances, putting their usefulness in competition with helicopters or even trucks for cargo. Of course the costs of producing these aircraft are astronomical to start, so we can just expect a few well-heeled passengers to be ferried around, or for critical services like medical evacuations on the immediate horizon, with the promise of a broader future on the horizon.

Then again, some companies have stopped gambling on an electric aviation future altogether and have turned their focus to low-carbon fuels.

HIA Milestone Delivery Report lists critical next steps for UK to be leader in global hydrogen aviation race - Airbus,"Mon, 18 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyNC0wMy1oaWEtbWlsZXN0b25lLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LXJlcG9ydC1saXN0cy1jcml0aWNhbC1uZXh0LXN0ZXBzLWZvci11ay10b9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Hydrogen in Aviation alliance is calling for a comprehensive industrial strategy for aviation to ensure the UK is a global leader in the development of hydrogen aviation

The report sets out how to ensure the country has the right conditions for the technological development, regulation, infrastructure, financial framework and hydrogen supply that will be needed for hydrogen aviation

HIA's ultimate goal is to ensure hydrogen-powered flights become a reality to help preserve the huge social and economic benefits that aviation brings

The Alliance, formed of major players across the aviation, manufacturing and renewable energy sectors, see hydrogen as one of the key tools for the decarbonisation of aviation, and key to creating new jobs and supporting the sector's long term sustainable future

The Hydrogen in Aviation alliance (HIA), formed of easyJet, Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Ørsted, GKN Aerospace, Bristol Airport and ZeroAvia, has today released its Milestone Delivery Report – outlining the steps and timeline the UK Government and industry needs to follow to secure its position as a global leader in hydrogen-powered aviation.

The UK is home to many world-first advances in hydrogen-powered aircraft technology, from hydrogen engine testing to the first flights of hydrogen-fuelled planes – making it well placed to be a leader in hydrogen aviation. This would secure substantial economic, employment and sustainability benefits. To realise these benefits we need an industrial strategy for the sector focussed on these long term opportunities.

The UK will need to secure massive increases in hydrogen supply. This will involve the accelerated deployment of renewable energy generation and significant investment in hydrogen infrastructure and skills.

In order to achieve this, HIA's new Milestone Delivery Report – which has been shaped by accurate aviation demand figures and other critical industry data – outlines specific steps that need to be taken by industry, government and regulators to equip the UK with everything it needs to be a leader in the field of hydrogen-powered aviation.

Johan Lundgren, CEO of easyJet and first Chair of HIA, said:

“It's without doubt that the UK is well placed to be a global leader in hydrogen – but the opportunity will be gone if we do not act now to build on all the great work that has already been done.

“The breakthroughs in hydrogen-powered technology happening across the UK are truly astonishing but these advances will be inconsequential if we fail to complement them with the appropriate skills, infrastructure, investment and regulation needed to support hydrogen aviation.

“HIA's Milestone Delivery Report outlines the critical steps and the timeframe needed to do this and if followed, not only will it create significant wealth, jobs and prosperity across industry and across the UK, it will be a vital component in decarbonising the aviation sector.”

Mark Bentall, Head of Research & Technology at Airbus, said:

“Technology is already unlocking the potential of hydrogen as a new fuel and Airbus is firmly focused on getting a hydrogen powered aircraft in the air by 2035. Beyond the aircraft, we have to prepare people, policy and infrastructure to build a world-leading hydrogen aviation economy in the UK. This report gives us the blueprint for making it happen, so now is the time to follow through.”

Dave Lees, CEO of Bristol Airport, said:

“Having hydrogen refuelling infrastructure at airports, operated by a skilled workforce, is critical to the success of zero emissions flight. Leaders such as Bristol Airport stand ready to work with industry, government, and regulators to begin the first commercial hydrogen flights within this decade. We can play our part to support the UK to seize the economic and social opportunities of zero emission flight.”

Russ Dunn, CTO of GKN Aerospace, said:

“This report sets the direction for a very exciting carbon-free future of flight. At GKN Aerospace we are committed to making this a reality through our world-leading technology and partnerships across industry, academia and government. The UK now needs to commit to this at a national level - to truly coordinate efforts and seize the opportunity that is in front of us. Now is the time to prepare for and enable the huge sustainability and economic potential of hydrogen for both the aviation industry and wider economy.”

Robert Duncalf, Head of Commercial P2X at Ørsted, said:

“Across a number of sectors, including aviation, de-fossilisation will only be achieved through innovation and focussed investment from industry and government. The potential for use of green hydrogen produced through renewable energy in the sector is clear, but there are many challenges ahead. What we need to see now is further collaborative action to ensure sustained momentum to overcome these challenges and take the UK hydrogen journey to the next stage.”

Alan Newby, Director of Research and Technology, Rolls-Royce, said:

“We believe in the potential of hydrogen-powered flight, and we are making good progress in developing the key technology building blocks required to make it a reality. This is an ambitious but necessary challenge, and we look forward to further accelerating progress across the entire hydrogen ecosystem with our industry partners and the UK government to achieve our shared vision of a more sustainable future for aviation.”

Sergey Kiselev, Chief Business Officer, ZeroAvia said:

“This report is a real testament to cross-industry efforts to set a practical pathway to adopting hydrogen as the fuel of the future for aviation. Hydrogen-powered aircraft will be flying commercially in the UK within the next few years, meaning that there will be a clear roadmap needed to scale the fuel supply as it grows into larger aircraft segments. Hydrogen in Aviation is a powerful coalition for driving this change in partnership with with the Government.”

The six key recommendations outlined by HIA in its milestone delivery report, include:

Hydrogen-ready technology research and development: HIA recommends that measures are taken to support the transition from research to development, and ultimately industrialisation, of world leading propulsion and flight technologies in the UK.

See more information in Chapter 1 of HIA's milestone delivery report (p.9 onwards) A hydrogen-ready CAA: HIA recommends that the CAA is appropriately resourced and funded with the capacity to lead on certification, standard-setting, and new regulation – working in co-ordination with other relevant bodies and the academic community to support a hydrogen-ready future.

See more information in Chapter 1 of HIA's milestone delivery report (pp. 13-14) Hydrogen-ready airports: HIA recommends building a well-developed network of hydrogen-ready airports both in the UK and overseas.

See more information on this section in Chapter 3 of HIA's milestone delivery report (p. 23 onwards) Transition fund and incentives: HIA recommends the government provide the necessary support and incentives needed to get the sector over the hurdle of transition costs and investment in new infrastructure.

See more information on this section in Chapter 4 of HIA's milestone delivery report (p. 29 onwards) Plan to deliver aviation's hydrogen requirements: Given the significant rise in demand for hydrogen that's expected over the next several decades, HIA recommends scaling up both hydrogen production capacity as well as renewable power, carbon capture and low carbon hydrogen generation to ensure the UK can secure sufficient hydrogen for all sectors that need to decarbonise, including aviation.

See more information on this section in Chapter 2 of HIA's milestone delivery report (p. 17 onwards) A hydrogen-ready skillforce: HIA recommends government and industry work together to equip the UK's workforce with the appropriate skills and ensure industry-readiness to support the transition to this new technology.

See more information on this section in Chapter 1 (p. 14) and Chapter 4 (pp. 35-37) of HIA's milestone delivery report

Delivering net zero, securing and creating jobs for the future:

The aviation sector is incredibly valuable to the UK's economy, bringing in more than £22bn directly to GDP, plus £34bn from exporting aerospace components. It also directly employs over 230,000 people.

HIA believes hydrogen will be critical in securing these jobs into the future as zero-emission technology develops, and this will bring immense value to regions all over the UK.

East Midlands Hydrogen, the UK's largest inland hydrogen cluster estimates its future hydrogen network could support up to 110,000 jobs in just the East Midlands alone – showing the potential that hydrogen has in terms of job creation.

As well as preserving an industry that is a key part of our economy, HIA maintains hydrogen could generate an additional £34bn for the UK every year.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999911785125732}",positive,0.9999911785125732,1
C295 hits 300 orders: The story of a global leader - Airbus,"Tue, 12 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDI0LTAzLWMyOTUtaGl0cy0zMDAtb3JkZXJzLXRoZS1zdG9yeS1vZi1hLWdsb2JhbC1sZWFkZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus C295 medium tactical transport aircraft has reached 300 orders. From the Pacific Ocean to the Arabian desert, from the tropical jungle to the Sahel and the Kazakh steppe, the C295 and its market share have become a success story for the European and Spanish aerospace industry. Here are 45 interesting facts and figures about the aircraft:

From the first C295 to the 300

1. The Airbus C295 has reached 300 orders following the Republic of Kazakhstan’s acquisition of a third aircraft, in transport configuration, for the National Security Committee Aviation Service. This new aircraft joins the two C295s already operated by this agency.

2. In 1999, the Spanish Air and Space Force became the first customer for the C295 by acquiring nine aircraft, in transport configuration, with the first aircraft being delivered in 2000.

3. The C295 is the market leader in the medium tactical transport category with more than 80% of the market. There are currently 41 operators from 37 countries in Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia. Of these 41 operators, 19 have made repeat orders.

4. India is the largest customer for the C295, with 56 units, 16 assembled in Seville and the remaining to be assembled by Tata in Vadodara, India. In September 2023, the Indian Air Force (IAF) took delivery of the first aircraft. Delivery of the second aircraft is scheduled for May 2024 and the next 14 will be delivered at a rate of one per month until August 2025.

5. So far, the C295 has accumulated 610,000 flight hours among all its operators. The operator with the highest number of flight hours is the Spanish Air and Space Force with more than 90,000 flight hours. The Brazilian Air Force has the C295 with the highest number of flight hours, accumulating more than 9,000 flight hours.

Global citizen

6. Following the success of the C212 and CN235, Construcciones Aeronáuticas (C.A.S.A.), the origin of Airbus in Spain, decided to launch the C295, the natural evolution of the CN235, a slightly larger aircraft with 50% more capabilities.

7. Compared to its predecessor, the C295 is characterised by a more powerful engine, the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW100 of 2645 hp, a new propeller, a redesigned wing, among other changes, but maintaining as much as possible the commonality between both platforms.

8. The name C295 stands for C for CASA, 2 for the number of engines and 95 for the maximum payload initially planned: 9.5 tonnes.

9. The programme was officially launched in 1996, construction of the first prototype began in early 1997 and the first flight took place in November of that year in Getafe, Madrid. In November 1999, Spanish National Institute for Aerospace Technology (INTA) militarily certified the aircraft for the first time.

10. The development of the aircraft is performed by Airbus engineers, mainly Spanish, but still a success story of Airbus’ European endeavour.

11. The 35th Wing from the Spanish Air and Space Force operates its fleet of C295s in transport configuration from the Getafe Air Base. For example, these C295s form part of the Ivory Detachment in Senegal.

12. The Spanish National Institute for Aerospace Technology (INTA) has been operating a C295 since 2023 for scientific research, such as geospatial data collection (agriculture, geology, atmosphere, inland waters).

13. In December 2023, the Spanish Ministry of Defence also acquired 16 C295s in maritime patrol and surveillance configurations. These aircraft, which will be designed and manufactured entirely in Spain, reinforce the defence industrial footprint and national sovereignty.

14. The C295 MPA acquired by Spain is the most advanced mission configuration and the C295 with the highest capabilities. A major development project that will bring together the latest technologies to provide a major operational advantage to our customer.

Production, maintenance and training

15. Design and engineering work on the C295 is carried out at the Airbus facilities in Getafe.

16. The Tablada plant in Seville carries out the pre-assembly of large components for the C295, such as the fuselage, which is then assembled on the final assembly line (FAL).

17. The C295 FAL is located at Airbus’ San Pablo Sur facilities in Seville.

18. The assembly of an aircraft is a complex process that depends on many manufacturing variables but, as an approximation, it could be said that a C295 in transport configuration is delivered in a period of between one and two years. Delivery times for a standard mission version would be from 2 years. This time may increase depending on the configuration selected.

19. Between 200 and 250 people are directly involved in the C295 manufacturing process.

20. The final assembly process is divided into four parts: integration, testing, painting and flying.

21. The production of the C295 is characterised by digitalisation, with tablets or mixed reality glasses being used to assemble the parts instead of paper.

22. Another FAL is currently under construction at Vadodara in India for the production of 40 of the Indian Air Force’s 56 C295s. Delivery of the first ""Make in India"" C295 is scheduled for 2026.

23. The San Pablo Norte facility performs maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) on C295s already in service with various customers.

24. Pilots, maintenance technicians and loadmasters from different C295 customers are trained at the International Training Centre (ITC) in San Pablo, with courses lasting between 2 and 60 days. The ITC has two C295 flight simulators, one with Thales avionics and the other with Collins avionics.

25. Since the delivery of the first C295 aircraft, approximately 700 pilots and 1,700 maintenance technicians have been trained and qualified at ITC.

26. Airbus provides support at C295 operators' air bases through its service personnel to ensure the highest possible fleet availability. Airbus Field-Service Representatives (FSR) are currently deployed at C295 bases in Brunei, Canada, Colombia, Egypt, India, Ireland, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Portugal, Serbia and the United Arab Emirates.

Versions

27. The C295 is characterised by its versatility, both in terms of missions and configurations. The best-selling version of the C295 is the transport version, capable of carrying 70 military personnel or 48 paratroopers, VIP personnel, container loads, vehicles or pallets. Serbia, Poland and Mexico are some of the operators of the transport version.

28. The C295 can be converted into an air ambulance with up to 24 stretchers and 7 medical assistants or even intensive care. During the COVID-19 crisis, in humanitarian disasters such as Cyclone Idai in Mozambique or in war conflicts such as Afghanistan or Mali, the C295 has been used in medical evacuation configuration (MEDEVAC).

29. The maritime patrol version (C295 MPA) carries out surveillance, anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare missions, thanks to the use of active and passive sensors, a magnetic anomaly detector and a high performance radar.

30. Maritime and land surveillance and search and rescue are the main missions of the MSA (Maritime Surveillance Aircraft) variant, acquired by Portugal, Chile, Oman, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Canada, Ireland, Angola and Spain.

31. The C295 can also be configured to support Special Operations, with incremental configurations ranging from a transport aircraft to an internally armed and/or under-wing mission aircraft to perform close air support (CAS) operations.

32. The mission C295s are equipped with the FITS (Fully Integrated Tactical System) mission system, developed by Airbus Defence and Space, which enables the C295 to perform roles ranging from anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare (ASW) to search and rescue (SAR), maritime patrol (MPA), signals intelligence (SIGINT) and environmental protection, among others. FITS can be remotely operated from land.

33. The C295 can also be used as a tanker aircraft for aerial refuelling of other aircraft or helicopters, in both day and night operations. This requires the installation of a roll-on/roll-off kit.

Missions

34. Versatility, reliability and low cost are the hallmarks of the C295 and have made it a global success. In the most demanding deployments, it has achieved fleet availability rates of over 95%. This is the case of the two Spanish Air and Space Force C295s, which operated for an average of 160 hours per month for 11 months in Chad in support of the EUFOR mission to improve security in the region.

35. Senegal is using the C295 in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilisation Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). For example, in just 14 days in 2024, they flew 28 flights averaging 16 hours per day (221 hours in total). During these flights, they covered 43,400 nautical miles (about 80,000 km) and carried 1,000 passengers and 56 tonnes of cargo (at an average of 2 tonnes of cargo and 35 passengers per flight).

36. The C295 is capable of taking off and landing on short (STOL), soft-surfaced, unpaved runways, making it the ideal aircraft for theatres of operation around the world, from desert and arid to icy and tropical climates.

37. An example of a STOL capability is the training of the Polish or Finnish C295s to be ready to use roads as secondary runways in case of an attack on the country.

38. In June 2023, a Colombian Air Force C295 transported the four children who had spent forty days lost in the Colombian jungle to a hospital in Bogotá. Once it was known that the children had been found, a C295 was modified in just an hour and a half to become an air ambulance. The pilot landed with night vision goggles on an unprepared runway with no tower, where the children were picked up and flown to Bogotá.

39. The C295 cruises at altitudes of up to 30,000 ft but also excels at low altitudes and low speeds, ideal for maritime patrol missions.

40. The missions of the two Irish Air Corps C295s include monitoring illegal fishing in their fishing grounds and pollution from vessels near their coastlines.

41. Portugal often uses its C295s to transport patients in need of medical care between the islands of the Azores or Madeira archipelago or to the mainland.

42. During the COVID-19 crisis, the 35th wing of the Spanish Air and Space Force transported masks and food rations in a C295 to the island of Tenerife, off the coast of Africa, while Brazilian authorities loaded the aircraft with respirators in Sao Paulo, bound for Fortaleza, in the north-east of the country. Other C295 operators used it to transport citizens infected with the virus.

43. The Chilean Navy has used its C295s to support firefighting in the Biobío region in the south of the country, while Colombia has used the aircraft to create water lines to fight fires in Vichada, on the border with Venezuela.

44. The C295 is also used for the shipment of humanitarian material, as in the case of the Philippine Air Force, which sent 1,500 aid boxes to Visayas and Mindanao following the floods that affected these regions of the country.

45. The C295 can also fly on up to 50 per cent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a blend of waste oils, vegetables and fats, free of aromatics and sulphur, without modifications to the aircraft, as part of the military aviation decarbonisation goal.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9998843669891357}",positive,0.9998843669891357,1
"Qatar Airways to launch First Class, as airline courts Airbus and Boeing for new planes - CNBC","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDMvMTUvcWF0YXItYWlyd2F5cy10by1sYXVuY2gtZmlyc3QtY2xhc3MtYXMtYWlybGluZS1jb3VydHMtYWlyYnVzLWFuZC1ib2VpbmctZm9yLW5ldy1wbGFuZXMuaHRtbNIBf2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDI0LzAzLzE1L3FhdGFyLWFpcndheXMtdG8tbGF1bmNoLWZpcnN0LWNsYXNzLWFzLWFpcmxpbmUtY291cnRzLWFpcmJ1cy1hbmQtYm9laW5nLWZvci1uZXctcGxhbmVzLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"watch now

Qatar Airways is developing a First Class concept and pursuing aircraft orders from aviation giants Boeing and Airbus, as part of a broader strategic overhaul under new group CEO Badr Mohammed Al Meer. ""This is a new era,"" Al Meer told CNBC on Thursday, unveiling changes at the airline that follow a multi-month ""war room"" review. Formerly the chief operating officer of Qatar's Hamad International Airport, Al Meer took over from long-time predecessor Akbar Al Baker as Qatar Airways CEO in November and seeks to refresh the airline's strategy and reset supplier relationships. Al Meer confirmed to CNBC that Qatar Airways is now developing a high-yielding First Class concept for its cabins. ""We wanted to combine the experience of flying commercial and flying on a private jet and develop something new,"" he said. ""We are 70% to 80% ready. We are only finalizing colors and small touches, but hopefully we will be able to announce it very soon."" First Class seating typically offers a more spacious, premium quality and higher cost experience aboard an aircraft. Some airlines have abandoned, reduced or rebranded First Class seats in a bid to maximize aircraft space and offer more economic seating for budget-conscious travelers. Along with preparing its First Class proposal, Qatar Airways is redesigning its premium ""Q-Suite"" class of seats, and the latest offering is set to debut at the Farnborough International Airshow in July.

New orders

The Gulf carrier has also submitted a Request for Proposal to Boeing and Airbus for a ""big"" new aircraft order, Al Meer said. ""We released an RFP to create some competition between both suppliers,"" he noted, without disclosing specifics. ""We will go through the process, and, with an order this big, we need to take our time."" Al Meer wants to enhance the service offering and capitalize on momentum following the Qatar World Cup, which helped the airline deliver a record net profit of $1.21 billion in the fiscal year 2022-23, as well as the highest yields and load factors in its history. ""The markets that we want to grow in are China, India, Australia, Japan, Korea, and a few others,"" Al Meer said. He separately flagged that regional demand for flying is high, and passenger numbers had picked up by more than 30% in the last four months, while forecasting growth is likely to ""be more settled below 10%-15%,"" for the rest of the year.

The new aircraft order proposal follows a major legal dispute between Qatar Airways and Airbus over safety concerns caused by paint degradation. It also comes amid an ongoing crisis of confidence at Boeing after the Max 9 door blowout in January raised concerns over safety, quality controls and production and delivery delays. ""We are affected when our aircrafts are not being delivered on time,"" Al Meer said. ""I know Airbus and Boeing have certain problems. We have full trust in both organizations and they're strong enough to overcome those problems."" Al Meer noted he expects to receive Qatar's latest Boeing 777X order by the end of next year, adding he's ""110% confident"" Boeing makes safe planes.

Al Meer also said Qatar Airways would halt Al Baker's plans for a fast ""phase-out"" of the flagship Airbus A380. Rival Emirates also signaled it would hold onto the airliner, despite Airbus ending its production in 2021.

New hangar expands Airbus footprint in Mobile – this time at the other airport - Fox 10 News,"Wed, 06 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDEwdHYuY29tLzIwMjQvMDMvMDcvbmV3LWhhbmdhci1leHBhbmRzLWFpcmJ1cy1mb290cHJpbnQtbW9iaWxlLXRoaXMtdGltZS1vdGhlci1haXJwb3J0L9IBdWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDEwdHYuY29tLzIwMjQvMDMvMDcvbmV3LWhhbmdhci1leHBhbmRzLWFpcmJ1cy1mb290cHJpbnQtbW9iaWxlLXRoaXMtdGltZS1vdGhlci1haXJwb3J0Lz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MOBILE, Ala. (WALA) - The latest Airbus facility now officially is open for business.

The company on Wednesday unveiled a new 17,000-square-foot hangar, plus an adjacent building, that expands the total facility at Mobile Regional Airport to 62,000 square feet. This is part of the company’s U.S. Space & Defense affiliate.

“Another Airbus announcement,” Mobile Chamber President & CEO Bradley Byrne said. “Most Airbus announcements we get to do are at Brookley. Today is special because we’re here.”

The sprawling facility at Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley, where Airbus assembles commercial airplanes, is the better-known of the company’s facilities in Mobile and has made the city the fourth-largest aircraft manufacturing hub in the world.

But the company’s first facility actually was the operation at Mobile Regional Airport. It dates to 2005 and repairs and refurbishes military aircraft. It is basically a repair shop for military planes, a bit like taking your broken-down car to the mechanic.

“A little bit more complicated than the car getting overhauled,” said Robert Geckle, chairman and CEO of Airbus U.S. Space & Defense. “But essentially, it’s a support sustainment and overhaul operation. And then we’ll get it back in service for the end user.”

Geckle said the expansion allows the company to service larger aircraft.

“Nothing makes me happier than expanding out footprint in Mobile, Alabama,” he said during the ribbon-cutting ceremony.

Jose-Antonio De La Fuente, head of U.S. Military Aircraft for the company, was one of the first Airbus employees in Mobile – long before it built its commercial airline assembly plant at Brookley.

“The expansion during the last 10 years is really impressive on the commercial side,” he said. “On the defense side, even though at a smaller scale, we have also grown in terms of autonomy, the way we provide support to our customers.”

The expansion means more jobs at one of the city’s most important employers. There are about 2,000 workers at Brookley, with plans to ramp that up to 3,000 by the end of the year. De La Feunte said employment at the military aircraft site has doubled the last three years to about 140 – with plans to add more.

Airbus has announced plans to bid on a contract to build aerial refueling tankers for the Air Force. The company said it remains committed to providing the Air Force with the “most modern and capable tanker on the market” and is responding to the government’s formal request for information. Should it win that contact, the planes would be assembled at Brookley, but there would be a role for employees at Mobile Regional Airport, as well.

Chris Curry, president of the Mobile Airport Authority, said operations like Airbus facility there take on added importance with commercial flights soon relocating to Brookley.

“So when most people ask, ‘What are we gonna do with the Mobile Regional Airport?’ – we’re gonna continue to still own and operate it because of projects like this,” he said.

Airbus establishes an OpenCargoLab with leading airfreight industry partners - Airbus Aircraft,"Wed, 13 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2FpcmNyYWZ0LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyNC0wMy1haXJidXMtZXN0YWJsaXNoZXMtYW4tb3BlbmNhcmdvbGFiLXdpdGgtbGVhZGluZy1haXJmcmVpZ2h0LWluZHVzdHJ50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse/Bremen, 13 March 2024 - Airbus has launched the OpenCargoLab, a collaborative initiative with leading partners from the airline, logistics and handling sectors, focusing on the entire airfreight ecosystem. The collaboration involves a team of experts from CHAMP Cargosystems, Fraport, KLM Cargo, Kuehne+Nagel and Swissport. Together, the partners will work to drive digital, resource-saving concepts, contributing to more resilient and efficient airfreight processes.

Announced at the IATA World Cargo Symposium in Hong Kong taking place from 12 to 14 March, the OpenCargoLab supports Airbus’ forecast, which expects the global freight market to grow by 50% by 2042. Specifically for Asia-Pacific, the region’s continued rapid economic growth means this market remains highly promising for modern airfreight business with digital-savvy hubs. Airbus anticipates demand for around 400 widebody freighters, including new builds and conversions, in Asia-Pacific over the next 20 years. This represents more than 25% of global demand for 1,490 cargo aircraft in the above 40 tonne segment.

As part of the OpenCargoLab initiative, Airbus will also evaluate digital solutions such as augmented reality and robotics in order to optimise data connectivity in general and, for example, the transport of dangerous goods in particular.

""With the OpenCargoLab, we benefit from a holistic think tank for the dynamically growing cargo market and thus an agile environment for developing innovations connecting the airfreight market of today and tomorrow,” says Marvin Ehrmann, Head of Airbus’ OpenCargoLab. “We are very excited to have established a thought leadership platform where experienced partners can drive the airfreight sector to become even more efficient, sustainable and connected.”

In addition, the OpenCargoLab will contribute to the A350F’s further design and application development. Just two-and-a-half years after launch, the order book for this all-new, next-generation freighter stands at 50 firm orders from nine customers as Airbus steadily expands its market share in this highly competitive segment.

In order to test the findings developed at the OpenCargoLab, an innovative test field for validating these new technology concepts is currently established at Airbus’ Cargo competence site in Bremen, Germany, e.g. known for the development of the cargo loading systems or the cargo door actuation systems. Among others, a replica of the A350F fuselage with the large cargo door included will be installed at the sites’ new Cargo Test Center by the end of 2024.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999511241912842}",positive,0.9999511241912842,1

Spirit AeroSystems is in parallel conversations with Boeing and Airbus about its strategic shape, 19 years after it was first divested by the U.S. plane maker in what has been widely considered a massive strategic error by Boeing.

Boeing confirmed Friday that it is in “preliminary discussions about making Spirit AeroSystems a part of Boeing again.” That statement followed reporting by the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News that the pair were in talks and Spirit had hired bankers to explore strategic options for the aerostructures supplier that was spun off from Boeing in 2005.

Airbus-built TEXUS sounding rockets take to the skies to conduct experiments in microgravity - Airbus,"Mon, 25 Mar 2024 13:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDI0LTAzLWFpcmJ1cy1idWlsdC10ZXh1cy1zb3VuZGluZy1yb2NrZXRzLXRha2UtdG8tdGhlLXNraWVzLXRvLWNvbmR1Y3QtZXhwZXJpbWVudHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Great discoveries may start with these little experiments

TEXUS 59 & 60 successively and successfully launched in less than two months

The TEXUS 60 rocket was successfully launched on Sunday 24 March, at 10:45 CET, from Esrange Space Centre in Kiruna, Sweden. The rocket reached an apogee of 251 km and provided 362 seconds of microgravity time. The payloads on board included two DLR experiments for the German Aerospace Center (DLR), called Simona and GECO, as well as a joint experiment of DLR and the Japanese Space Agency JAXA, called Phoenix 2.

During a microgravity time period of six minutes, Simona performed an experiment to study specific reactions of liquid alloys in microgravity to enhance advanced materials for car engine bearings, while GECO recorded calcium interaction with microgravity in plants to expand our knowledge about plant cultivation to ensure, for instance, a food source in space. Finally, Phoenix 2 got deeper into droplet interaction in spontaneous ignition of multiple fuel droplets that will lead to a better understanding of liquid spray combustion which is employed in industrial furnaces, boilers, gas turbines, diesels, spark-ignition, and rocket engines.

Previously, the TEXUS 59 rocket was successfully launched from Esrange on 15 February carrying two ESA experiments, Safari and T-REX , and one DLR experiment, Topoflame, on board.

Safari, for example, aimed to study the growth of crystals that can lead to improvements in drug development to better understand the function of molecules that are important in health and disease, and agricultural solutions that better protect crops and enhance plant growth on Earth. T-REX, studying different behaviour of immune system cells under microgravity. Its findings could help to understand the biological process that allows a cell or an organism to respond to a variety of signals since this is one of the leading causes in various human diseases. More than fifty percent of cancers arise due to frequent mutations in genes.

The last experiment aboard TEXUS 59 was Topoflame, aimed to understand the insights of fire safety in astronautical spaceflight, studying flame propagation along solid fuels. Planned space exploration missions raise concerns about fire safety and propagation under conditions of reduced gravity.

These launches represent a double success generating an enormous amount of data to support scientists.

Airbus as prime contractor for TEXUS

Airbus is in charge of the development of the TEXUS rockets, from the mission concept and engine procurement to the data recovery. The average weight of a TEXUS payload is around 350 kg.

Airbus engineers from different disciplines develop, integrate and test the experimental equipment. In collaboration with customers and scientific teams, they establish experimental concepts. Breadboard tests are conducted to support design decisions. Depending on the results, further tests may be required to determine or verify critical parameters of the experiment before launch. Design reviews with customers ensure that their requirements are fully met.

Finally, the experimental equipment is integrated, tested at various stages and verified. All this goes hand-in-hand with the development of the ground support systems needed to control the experiments during the test phase in Bremen and during the flight from Esrange.

Before transferring all flight hardware and ground systems to Esrange, a flight system acceptance review is organised with customers, which also covers the contributions of subcontractors: the service system (communication between the experiments and the ground station), the recovery system (parachutes), the rocket engines (solid propellant) and the readiness of the facilities at Esrange.

Reduced volume makes payload more complex - Copyright Airbus

What is at stake?

Sounding rockets – also known as research rockets – launch scientific and technological experiments to the edge of space before falling back to Earth. Put simply, TEXUS helps scientists conduct biological, material science and physical experiments under microgravity conditions. The programme also plays an important role in preparing experiments for the International Space Station (ISS).

In ballistic flight, a TEXUS rocket reaches a peak altitude of about 260 kilometres. The flight, from lift-off to landing, takes about 15 minutes. As it falls freely, the experiments inside experience weightlessness for a duration of six minutes, which is only about one ten thousandth of the Earth’s normal gravity. During these six minutes of valuable research time, the scientists can directly control and monitor their experiments from the ground using telecommand and video transmission. The data is collected during the flight by telemetry and after recovery of the payload. The rocket’s payload lands by parachute and is recovered by helicopter with the support of Airbus and the Swedish Space Corporation, Esrange’s operator.

In gravitational biology, for instance, the role of gravity for cellular growth, development, reproduction, movement, orientation and other physiological processes, as well as the mechanisms of adaptation and compensation, are investigated. In bioprocessing, cell fusion and cell cultivation techniques are investigated. Also, growth of high-quality monocrystals of biological macromolecules for crystal structure analysis; or rapid technological processes such as electrophoresis and electrofusion can be performed. These are only some of the research areas studied that ultimately translate into tangible benefits for society.

The advantages of sounding rockets

Mission costs are substantially less than those required for orbital missions

Since they never enter orbit, they do not require extreme propulsion or telemetry and tracking coverage. The costs of the rocket are shared between 2, 3 or 4 research centres that provide their experiments. In addition, they serve as a test bed for future innovations that will go on board satellites or even the Space Station.

Rapid availability from conception to flight

The payload can be developed in a very short time frame of 6 to 18 months. Moreover, with such a short development time, the latest technology can be incorporated into its experiments. It also offers a very fast response capability, e.g. to arrive in time to study cosmological phenomena, such as the effects of an extreme solar flare on the auroras' behaviour.

Direct involvement

Investigators are directly involved in developing the hardware, and in the preparation and execution of the experiment. Remote operation of the experiment can be done directly by the scientist during flight via telecommand and the support of adequate laboratory facilities at the launch site.

Support of orbital research

Sounding rockets offer the possibility of conducting a series of periodical investigations for rapid verification of data used to prepare experiments that will later be implemented on the ISS.

TEXUS (Technological Experiments in Zero Gravity) is the world's most successful and longest lasting sounding rocket programme – the first TEXUS rocket launched in December 1977. Customers include the European Space Agency and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) working together with various research institutes and universities around the world.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.966200053691864}",positive,0.966200053691864,1

The order consists of 85 Airbus A321neo planes, 85 Boeing 737 Max 10 jets and 90 smaller Embraer E175 aircraft. Boeing’s equal standing in the deal suggests that American remains confident in the manufacturer after a panel blew out from a Max 9 plane during a Alaska Airlines flight in January. That episode resulted in no major injuries but reignited concerns about the safety and quality of Boeing planes.

The airline’s chief financial officer, Devon May, told reporters in an interview on Monday that American had faith that Boeing would improve quality after a preliminary federal investigation suggested that the Alaska Airlines plane might have left Boeing’s factory without bolts critical to securing the panel.

Here are 30 facts and figures on why the European fighter jet will continue to be state-of-the-art for the next three decades:

Experience of a lifetime

On March 27, 1994, the Eurofighter Typhoon DA1 (Development Aircraft) took off for its maiden flight in Manching, Bavaria. A unique experience for test pilot Peter Weger: ""I knew that I was piloting an incredible aircraft and that we had something special. It was one of those days that you will remember for the rest of your life.""

A true European

The Eurofighter is an all-weather, twin-engine, multi-role combat aircraft that can be used for air-to-air and air-to-ground combat. It was developed jointly by four European countries: Germany, Great Britain, Italy and Spain.

One for all and all for one

Airbus (Germany and Spain), BAE Systems (UK) and Leonardo (Italy) form the Eurofighter consortium, which manages the Eurofighter Typhoon in consultation with the four partner nations.

Guarantee of security and freedom

The Eurofighter continues to do what it does best: Among other tasks, it secures NATO's eastern flank and ensures that Europeans can live in security and freedom. Find out more here.

Always on duty

In June 2023, along with other Airbus military aircraft, the Eurofighter played a crucial role in Air Defender, the largest deployment of NATO air forces in the alliance's history. Learn more here.

With 150,000 hp to Mach 2.35

The two engines of the Eurofighter Typhoon produce around 150,000 horse-power and accelerate it up to Mach 2.35 - just under 2,900 kilometers per hour.

Soaring to 11,000 metres in 2 minutes

The Eurofighter only needs 2 minutes to climb to almost 11,000 meters. This makes it ideal for QRA duty (Quick Reaction Alert), preventing intruders from penetrating national territory.

680 orders worldwide

To date, 680 Eurofighter Typhoons have been ordered by 9 countries - 603 of which have already been delivered. The first Eurofighter was delivered to the German Air Force in 2003.

Backbone of European air forces

With over 850,000 flight hours, the Eurofighter Typhoon forms the backbone of the German, British, Italian and Spanish air forces.

International player

Five export customers fly the Eurofighter Typhoon: Austria (15 aircraft), Saudi Arabia (72), Oman (12), Kuwait (28) and Qatar (24).

The Eurofighter partner companies continue to pursue a number of significant opportunities around the world and are confident to sell more Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft internationally.

Four final assembly lines

Airbus produces the Eurofighter in Manching near Ingolstadt (for the German Air Force) and in Getafe near Madrid (for the Spanish Air Force). BAE Systems and Leonardo produce the aircraft in the UK (Warton) and Italy (Turin) respectively.

The best from Europe

The main components for the Eurofighter come from the four Eurofighter partner companies. Airbus Germany supplies the centre fuselage section, Airbus Spain the right wing. BAE Systems from the UK contributes the front fuselage section, the fin and, together with Leonardo from Italy, the rear fuselage. Leonardo also produces the left wing.

14 steps to the finished Eurofighter

Eurofighter final assembly comprises the assembly of the main components, including the subsequent ground and flight tests before handover to the customer. In total, there are 14 steps to the finished Eurofighter.

Always on for customers

Airbus is also there for its customers after delivery. In Germany and Spain, the company is making sure that the respective air force’s Eurofighters are ready for action when it counts.

In Manching, Airbus has been working together with the German Air Force for over 20 years. More information about the unique cooperation here.

Airbus supports the Spanish Air Force’s Eurofighters in Albacete and Morón. This includes a training centre at Morón Air Base and in-service support, for example during NATO air policing missions.

Quadriga Eurofighters for the German Air Force

Airbus is currently manufacturing 38 Tranche 4 Eurofighters for the German Air Force, the so-called Quadriga, in Manching. The company will deliver 30 single-seaters and 8 twin-seaters between 2025 and 2030. The contract was signed at the end of 2020. Those new aircraft are planned to replace the Bundeswehr's first tranche of Eurofighters.

Halcon Eurofighters for Spain

Airbus will also deliver 20 new Tranche 4 Eurofighters, also known as Halcon I, to the Spanish Air Force from 2026 to 2030. On September 12, 2023, the Spanish government also gave its approval for the expenditure for a further series of Eurofighters. Halcon 2 would comprise around 25 Eurofighters for the Spanish Air Force.

Fit for electronic combat

Airbus will equip Eurofighters of the German Air Force for electronic combat by 2030. The Eurofighter EK (Elektronischer Kampf - Electronic Warfare) will expand the jet's already broad operational spectrum and strengthen European sovereignty and autonomy. More information here.

Bridge to the future - 2 important decisions

According to current planning, production of the Eurofighter in Germany will come to an end in 2030 with the delivery of the last Tranche 4 aircraft. The consequence would be a production gap of 10 years without orders for the domestic industry until the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) goes into operation in 2040.

Without a follow-up order, the end of combat aircraft construction in Germany would be imminent - and with it the loss of jobs, tax revenues, cutting-edge technologies and expertise.

In order to prevent this, the timely commissioning of the further development of the Eurofighter (Long-Term Evolution; LTE) and a fundamental decision on a follow-up procurement of new Eurofighters (Tranche 5) are necessary.

Find out more on this here.

Eurofighter LTE upgrade: new cockpit, more computing power

The Long-Term Evolution capability development programme of the four core nations (Germany, Spain, Great Britain and Italy) provides for the modernization of important components, including the cockpit and adding more computing power. This will keep the Eurofighter at the cutting edge of technology. Contract signature is expected in 2024.

Need for 100 new Tranche 5 Eurofighters

In order to keep the expertise and strategic capability to develop and produce fighter jets in Germany and to bridge a potential production gap of 10 years (see above “Bridge to the future”), an additional order of approximately 100 new Tranche 5 Eurofighters would be required. 50 of these aircraft would then be produced by Airbus in Manching, Germany. The remaining 50 aircraft, coming from potential export orders, would be assembled in one of the three other assembly lines in Italy (Leonardo), Spain (Airbus) and the UK (BAE Systems).

In addition, Spain also has up to 25 aircraft in the pipeline (Halcon 2, see above “Halcon Eurofighters for Spain”).

Guarantee of jobs in Europe

The Eurofighter programme is a significant economic factor. It secures 100,000 European jobs and involves 400 companies across Europe.

Over 120 German suppliers

According to a recent study, more than 120 suppliers throughout Germany are involved in the Eurofighter programme. In total, the Eurofighter secures 25,000 jobs in Germany. Find out more here.

Significant contribution to German GDP

By 2060, Eurofighter Tranche 4 will have contributed around € 6.5bn to German GDP. More details here.

Significant tax revenues in Germany

By 2060, Eurofighter Tranche 4 will generate tax revenue of around €3.6bn. Click here.

26,000 new jobs in Spain

The Eurofighter programme will cumulatively secure 26,000 jobs in Spain until 2060, according to a current study on the economic impact of the 'Halcon' and 'Quadriga' contracts for the country. For more details click here.

€1.7 billion for the Spanish GDP

The Spanish Halcon (20 Eurofighters for the Spanish Air Force) and German Quadriga (38 Eurofighters for the Luftwaffe) contracts are expected to contribute nearly €1.7 billion to Spanish GDP, with the manufacturing and maintenance of Halcon generating approximately €1.5 billion and the production of Quadriga making up the remaining €200 million.

Tax contribution of €430 million

The employment and economic impact will generate a total tax collection of €430 million, from which €151 million will be direct contribution. Furthermore, for every euro collected directly, €2.8 of total tax revenue will be generated in the Spanish economy.

Service-life beyond 2050

Thanks to its continuous development, the Eurofighter will remain state-of-the-art in the long term. It will remain the defence backbone of the European air forces into the 2050s, laying important technological foundations for the next generation of air combat platforms.

Technology bridge towards FCAS

Eurofighter will also be part of the Future Combat Air System (FCAS), where it will fly in a network with unmanned and manned platforms. This makes the Eurofighter the logical platform for bringing FCAS technologies and operational concepts to maturity. These include plans of teaming with drones in the early 2030s and the first ability to command multi-domain force packages including satellites, fighter aircraft, tankers, frigates and special forces from the fighter's cockpit.

Joint missions with drones

Drones with different sizes and capabilities are vital assets of FCAS, where they will complement and operate in a network with manned aircraft such as the New Generation Fighter and the Eurofighter, all connected to a cyber-secured combat cloud. Operating under the command of a manned fighter aircraft, drones provide better protection for pilots while enhancing the fighter’s operational envelope and the ability to act in risky situations.

See what it will make

Even after dozens of major economic development victories, including the $2.5 billion announcement for Aluminum Dynamics to build an aluminum flat roll mill, Joe Max Higgins, CEO of Golden Triangle Development Link, has no intention of taking his foot off the gas pedal.

The latest was recently announced that California–Airbus is to establish a final assembly line for the company’s H145 twin-engine light helicopter in Mississippi.

The new line will be located at Airbus’ facility in Columbus and will be capable of delivering 16 helicopters a year in 2025.

""Just a few months ago, we celebrated our 20th anniversary of doing business with Airbus,"" Higgins said. ""Everybody always wants to talk about the aluminum mill or the steel mill or whatever. We can never forget that the first Airbus project is what put the Golden Triangle on the map in modern day manufacturing.""

The Columbus facilities have built 480 UH-72 Lakota Light Utility Helicopters for the U.S. Army. It has also built around 25 EC145e aircraft for specialist EMS operator and completion firm Metro Aviation. More recently, the Columbus line built 18 UH-72Bs, a version of the five-blade H145, for the U.S. Army. It is also continuing to assemble H125 single-engine light helicopters for the U.S. market.

""We weren't putting a widget in a squidget. We were putting together a product that flies and flies people,"" Higgins said. ""More importantly, it has always been viewed as best in class. They are an exemplary partner. They are doing God's work for our men and women in the military as well as rescue equipment for hospitals and things like that.""

After a record year of sales for the H145 in 2023, which saw 186 aircraft ordered by customers, there is an “ambition to double production,” of the platform, Airbus Helicopters CEO Bruno Even said in a release. “The decision we took is based on the potential we see in North America.”

Since Airbus came to Columbus, it has made more than 1,700 deliveries, including 480 Lakotas, 500 H125s, 60 aircraft for the Department of Homeland Security, 500 retrofit modifications, 200 completions of aircraft and 12 re-engineered MH-65 aircraft.

""As long as we do our job and make the best damn helicopter in the world, Airbus in Columbus should never stop,"" Higgins said. ""We knew this contract was coming, but we couldn't be more proud for continuing this relationship.""

Airbus hopes to begin the contract on the H145 this year.

“This is another step to be even more close to our local customers by offering them a local product built in the U.S.,” Even said.

The Rosetta odyssey: first ever comet-chaser - Airbus,"Fri, 01 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDI0LTAzLXRoZS1yb3NldHRhLW9keXNzZXktZmlyc3QtZXZlci1jb21ldC1jaGFzZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Comets are time capsules containing original material left over from the epoch when the Sun and its planets formed. But before scientists planned the Rosetta mission only a handful of spacecraft had ever observed one up close for a short time only – let alone pushed space science to its limits by trying to follow a comet and even land on one…

20 years ago on 2 March 2004 the European Space Agency’s Rosetta mission lifted off on an Ariane 5 from French Guiana to make a 7.9 billion kilometre trip to rendezvous with comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P for short) and then despatch its tiny lander Philae onto the surface.

But 67P was not the original target for the Rosetta mission – it was actually due to head for comet 46P/Wirtanen in 2003, however after a problem with an Ariane 5, the launcher was grounded until the fault was found, and Ariane 5 was ready for the next launch. This meant the scientists had to hunt for a new target with a similar orbit as they only had one chance to catch that comet.

During its 10 year journey, the Airbus-built Rosetta performed a series of orbital manoeuvres using the gravitational pull of the Earth and Mars to act as a sling shot to pick up acceleration and reach the 55,000 km/h (over 15km per second!) it needed to catch up with 67P. Travelling at this speed and trying to rendezvous with the comet only 4 km wide was described as like a fly trying to land on a speeding bullet. Rosetta actually reached 123,000 km/h when shadowing the comet at the closest point to the Sun.

In July 2011, Rosetta was put into hibernation for its cold and lonely journey chasing 67P. It was kept alive by heating with the equivalent of just six lightbulbs to stop freezing its fuel. Thankfully in January 2014 the spacecraft was successfully woken up by 4 pre-programmed internal alarm clocks and started its tricky final approach to 67P. On 6 August 2014 its thrusters put the spacecraft into an orbit just 100km above the comet and matching its speed through space. Now Rosetta started its work, by measuring all the parameters of the comet, and by scanning and mapping the surface of this unknown body, to find a place to land on it.

Everyone remembers the tiny lander Philae bouncing down onto the surface of the comet – but this was only one of Rosetta’s achievements and discoveries. Equipped with 11 instruments Rosetta managed to take amazing measurements of the comet when it was inactive and then studied it as it approached the Sun and became active. And crucially also saw what happened when it flew away from our star and calmed down again.

On its journey Rosetta had to survive the searing heat of the Sun from the distance of Venus, as well as temperatures dipping down to minus 270°C in deep space from the distance of Jupiter, all the while making sure its fuel did not freeze.

As Gunther Lautenschlaeger, who was Airbus’ Rosetta project manager at the time said: “Reaching out behind the horizon, where nobody had been before, was incredibly challenging, we had to develop new concepts for the spacecraft so it could operate and survive autonomously. What we achieved has paved the way for many modern Airbus spacecraft.”

One example is the huge solar arrays developed to keep Rosetta alive at its furthest point where there is only 4% of sunlight compared to Earth’s orbit. This revolutionary technology enabled the arrays to be developed for JUICE, launched in 2023, which is successfully heading for Jupiter and its icy moons.

The lander Philae achieved a world first of landing on a comet – and it successfully carried out the majority of its mission sending scientific data up to Rosetta for onwards transmission to Earth. Its final resting place was sadly too shady to keep its batteries charged and so after 55 hours it went into hibernation.

Incredibly more than six months after it went silent in its shadowy landing spot, Philae came back to life on 14 June 2015 and pinged Rosetta. And started to send back more of its unique, invaluable data. It was early September 2016, towards the end of the momentous mission, before the first picture revealed where Philae had ended up, wedged in a dark crack that was christened Abydos.

And finally on 30 September Rosetta was instructed to make a controlled descent onto the comet’s surface – but unlike other exploration missions which are high velocity impacts, Rosetta’s touchdown was made at a sedate walking pace of 2 km/h.

Everyone will always remember the comet landing of Philae, but that would have been impossible without the amazing Rosetta spacecraft. Not only did it manage to rendezvous with the comet, but also successfully orbited it for more than two years, at altitudes from 100km right down to 2 km. With signals taking up to 40 minutes to reach the spacecraft from Earth. Rosetta’s autonomous navigation systems had to work perfectly to provide all 11 scientific instruments with a perfect view of the comet. Their journey together lasted from deep space well beyond the asteroid belt, right down to the closest approach to the Sun and out again, continuously scanning the comet, generating huge data volumes, and also of course, taking hundreds of incredible photos. A real mission to remember.

Airbus-built Rosetta was the first spacecraft to ever orbit a comet, and its lander Philae, the first to land on a comet.

In total, Rosetta travelled nearly 8 billion kilometres.

The Rosetta spacecraft did the mission with 11 Instruments on-board.

Rosetta needed 10 years to get up to the same speed as the comet.

Rosetta was able to follow the comet at a speed from 55,000 (at rendezvous) up to 123,000 km/h (at Sun closest point).

Mass of the orbiter was less than 3 tons, otherwise not possible to reach the comet - though there were 1,670 kg of fuel on board. The science payload weight 165 kg and the Lander (Philae) 100 kg.

Dimensions: Orbiter: 2.8 × 2.1 × 2.0 m with two 14 metre long solar panels

High performance Solar Arrays (68 m2) in both distances.

During its hibernation, which lasted over 900 days before approaching the comet, Rosetta was so far away from the Sun that the solar arrays could only get 400 watts of energy from the Sun, the equivalent of just six lightbulbs!

"Boeing's issues are prompting Hong Kong's flagship airline Cathay Pacific to consider an 'ABC' future: Airbus, Boeing ... - Fortune","Thu, 28 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vYXNpYS8yMDI0LzAzLzI4L2NhdGhheS1wYWNpZmljLWNlby1yb25hbGQtbGFtLWFiYy1mdXR1cmUtYm9laW5nLWFpcmJ1cy1jb21hYy1jOTE5LWNoaW5hLWhvbmcta29uZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing’s dominance of the commercial airplane market, alongside its rival Airbus, is looking more shaky than ever, after a door plug was ripped from a Boeing 737 Max 9 jet operated by Alaska Airlines earlier this year. Airline CEOs are now publicly demanding Boeing prioritize safety, as U.S. federal officials uncover dozens of manufacturing problems.

That may leave an opening for China’s state-backed Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) to shake things up. COMAC has spent the first few months of the year showing off its C919, a competitor to Boeing’s 737 and Airbus’s A320.

And Ronald Lam, CEO of Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong’s flagship airline, is paying attention. The airline CEO, in an interview with Fortune editor-in-chief Alyson Shontell at the Fortune Innovation Forum in Hong Kong on Thursday, said he expects a future “ABC” market for planes: Airbus, Boeing and COMAC.

The Cathay CEO said this “triangular competition” will be good for the industry. “We are very hopeful we can create another source of competition.”

Lam took over as Cathay’s CEO in January 2023, after previously serving as its chief customer and commercial officer and director of commercial and cargo.

Airline chiefs have been complaining about Boeing’s spate of safety and quality issues for the past few months. In January, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby called the temporary grounding of the 737 Max 9 the “straw that broke the camel’s back for us.”

And on Wednesday, Emirates CEO Tim Clark told CNBC that Boeing needs a “strong engineering lead as its head” and a “governance model that prioritizes safety and quality.”

Cathay Pacific has both Boeing and Airbus planes in its fleet. On Thursday, Lam was optimistic that the U.S. planemaker will be able to “come on strong in time.”

“They have some immediate issues they need to tackle, but I do have faith,” he said.

Lam is one of the first airline CEOs based outside of mainland China to comment on COMAC’s entry into the market. COMAC’s C919 does not fly commercial flights outside of mainland China, and only one non-Chinese carrier, a small Indonesian airline, flies the smaller ARJ21.

But COMAC still has a lot to overcome before it gets mass acceptance. The C919 needs to be approved by both U.S. and European regulators; without their assent, airlines won’t be able to operate the C919 commercially in those markets.

Moving past COVID

Cathay Pacific recorded a $1.25 billion profit last year, its first annual profit since 2019, off the back of surging post-pandemic travel demand.

The Hong Kong-based airline suffered throughout the pandemic because, unlike many other airlines, it could not fall back on a domestic travel market. Mainland China, a key market for Cathay, only reopened its borders to people from overseas locations, including Hong Kong, in early 2023. The carrier lost $4.3 billion during the three years of the pandemic.

Yet after both Hong Kong and mainland China lowered COVID restrictions, Cathay, like many other airlines, had a patchy recovery. The airline struggled to get its passenger services back online quickly, leading to a spate of cancelled or delayed flights due to staff shortages.

Now that Cathay’s financials have improved, Lam said he wanted to put the airline on a path to future success. China in particular could be Cathay’s “secret sauce to success in the future,” he said on Thursday.

The airline is also trying to build better customer experiences, including launching new business class and first class offerings on its Boeing 777s in 2024 and 2025.

And to fix its staffing shortage, Cathay Pacific will go on a hiring spree: It aims to grow its workforce by 5,000 employees this year, hiring both internationally and from mainland China.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9750789403915405}",neutral,0.9750789403915405,0
Airbus Debuts NextGen Air Taxi Ahead of First Flight - Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 07 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9haXJidXMtZGVidXRzLW5leHRnZW4tYWlyLXRheGktMTYyMTEwODU3Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus today unveiled the prototype of its fully electric CityAirbus NextGen, an electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicle (eVTOL) designed to operate in major cities. With its first flight scheduled for later this year, the two metric-ton class CityAirbus has a wing span of approximately 12 meters and will have about a 50-mile (80 km) range with a cruising speed of about 75 mph (120 km/h).

The CityAirbus NextGen has a unique configuration with fixed wings, a V-shaped tail and eight electric-powered propellers.

The unveiling coincided with the opening of a new CityAirbus test center in Donauwörth, Germany, which will be used to test eVTOL systems. The center is part of Airbus' Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) strategy, and it began operations in December 2023 with NextGen's power-on. The facility will next be used for remaining tests on the motors, flight controls, avionics and other systems before the prototype's maiden flight.

Airbus has been chasing the air taxi dream for some time now. Advanced Air Mobility between strategic locations in urban and suburban environments could complement existing transportation methods and alleviate congestion and other problems. The eVTOL could be used for everything from passenger transport and medical services to ecotourism, which is tourism directed toward threatened natural environments as part of conservation efforts.

The aircraft is designed to be quiet since it will be working in urban environments. Safety and efficiency during hover and cruise flight phases are also crucial, and NextGen relies on a mix of in-house and externally supplied components to make it happen.

Airbus has been expanding its global network to create the AAM supply chain. For example, Airbus recently signed a partnership agreement with LCI, a leading aviation company, to focus on developing partnerships and business models in strategy, commercialization and financing.

And in June, Airbus partnered with STMicroelectronics, a global semiconductor company, to collaborate on R&D to support the more efficient and lightweight power electronics required for future hybrid-powered aircraft and full-electric urban air vehicles.

EarthCARE goes west for launch - Airbus,"Sat, 09 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyNC0wMy1lYXJ0aGNhcmUtZ29lcy13ZXN0LWZvci1sYXVuY2jSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Munich, 09 March 2024 – The Airbus-built EarthCARE (Earth Clouds, Aerosols and Radiation Explorer) spacecraft has left Munich, Germany, and is now on its way aboard an aircraft to its launch site in Vandenberg, California. EarthCARE is planned to be launched in May on a Falcon 9 rocket.

EarthCARE is the most complex Earth Explorer mission in the European Space Agency’s (ESA) FutureEO programme. This new satellite mission will quantify and reduce the uncertainty about the role that clouds and aerosols (tiny atmospheric particles) play in heating and cooling Earth’s atmosphere, contributing to our better understanding of climate change. The spacecraft was developed, built and tested with the involvement of experts from 15 European countries as well as Japan and Canada.

Marc Steckling, Head of Earth Observation, Science and Exploration at Airbus said: “As the world’s climate continues to change at a faster and faster rate, scientists need ever more sophisticated space assets to enable better analysis. EarthCARE will help fill in the gaps by providing unprecedented measurements so that meteorologists and climatologists can better understand how energy is transmitted within the atmosphere.”

A joint undertaking between ESA and the Japanese Space Agency (JAXA), EarthCARE will examine the role clouds and aerosols play in reflecting solar radiation back into space and also in trapping infrared radiation emitted from the Earth’s surface.

EarthCARE will draw up vertical profiles of natural and human-made aerosols, register the distribution of water droplets and ice crystals and how they are transported in clouds, and provide essential input to improve the modelling of the warming climate and weather forecasting. Aerosols influence the life cycle of clouds, and so contribute indirectly to how they give off radiation – measuring them will give a better understanding of Earth’s energy budget.

EarthCARE is backed by more than 200 research institutes around the world. Scientists will be able to use the data to improve the accuracy of cloud development models, their behaviour, composition, and interaction with aerosols.

The atmospheric lidar ATLID is one of four instruments on the EarthCARE satellite providing vertical profiles of aerosols and thin clouds. ATLID is the second European spaceborne ultraviolet lidar after the wind sensing spacecraft Aeolus, making Airbus a worldwide specialist in spaceborne lidars.

In addition to ATLID the satellite also includes a Broad-Band Radiometer developed by ESA through European industry, a Multi-Spectral Imager developed by Airbus subsidiary SSTL and a Cloud Profiling Radar developed by JAXA. This unique combination of instruments will allow scientists for the first time to directly assess the role of clouds and aerosols on Earth’s radiation budget with one integrated satellite system thereby reducing current uncertainties. EarthCARE will circle Earth in a Sun-synchronous 400 km polar orbit crossing the equator in the early afternoon to optimise daylight conditions.

Airbus Defence and Space in Friedrichshafen (Germany) is prime contractor to develop and build the 2 tonne satellite, with Airbus Defence and Space in Toulouse (France) supplying the Atmospheric Lidar ATLID.

Korean Air Seals Deal With Airbus to Replace Long-Haul Jets - Skift Travel News,"Thu, 21 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjQvMDMvMjEva29yZWFuLWFpci1zZWFscy1kZWFsLXdpdGgtYWlyYnVzL9IBQ2h0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjQvMDMvMjEva29yZWFuLWFpci1zZWFscy1kZWFsLXdpdGgtYWlyYnVzL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Despite Boeing having its new 777X and 787 Dreamliner on offer, Airbus' best-selling widebody jet has clinched the deal.

Korean Air has confirmed a major deal with Airbus for a new generation of long-haul planes.

The Seoul-based flag carrier is adding a total of 33 Airbus A350s to its fleet. This comprises 27 of the largest A350-1000s and six of the smaller -900 variant.

The list price of the contract is $13.7 billion, however airlines typically negotiate discounts for such large deals.

Korean Air says the new jets will be mostly used for fleet renewal.

Boeing planes such as the 777 form the majority of the airline’s existing long-haul fleet. The U.S. planemaker’s yet-to-be certified 777X aircraft was not selected to replace outgoing Boeing models.

Korean Mega-Merger Pending

Korean Air also highlighted synergies with Asiana Airlines – which it is in the final stages of acquiring – as a key consideration. The carrier, which is also based in Seoul, already has a large fleet of A350 jets.

Of 13 global regulators, only the United States has yet to give the merger its approval. Korean and Asiana have already had to forfeit flying rights in select markets to appease international competition authorities.

While precise seating configurations are still to be confirmed for the new A350s, the -1000 has a capacity for between 350 and 410 in a regular three-class setup. The shorter -900 typically seats between 300 and 350 passengers, again in the three-cabin layout.

Air India and Delta Air Lines are among the other big name carriers to have opted for the European-built jet in recent months.

Where Will Korean Air’s A350 Fly?

In a statement, Korean Air referenced Seoul to New York as an example of a route well-suited to the new aircraft. The airline currently flies between the capitals twice daily, usually using Boeing planes such as the 747-8 jumbo.

The deal comes at a busy time for the flag carrier. Aside from the Asiana transaction, it also has more than 100 other new planes in the pipeline.

These include 50 A321neos narrowbody aircraft, also supplied by Airbus, as well as 30 787 Dreamliners and 30 737 Max 8s from Boeing.

Korean Air has traditionally hedged its fleet requirements by ordering aircraft from both of the big plane manufacturers. However, this latest deal for widebody jets looks set to tip the scales in Airbus’ favor.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999867677688599}",neutral,0.9999867677688599,0
"'Subcritical' Europe isn't ready for a Trump presidency, says Airbus boss - Fortune","Mon, 11 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjQvMDMvMTEvYWlyYnVzLWV1cm9wZS10cnVtcC1wcmVzaWRlbnQtY29tbWVudHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Europe is leaving its security in the hands of a fraught U.S. presidential election, the CEO of one of the world’s biggest aircraft makers says, arguing the continent is “subcritical” in several defense areas amid the backdrop of a potential all-out war with Russia.

In an interview with The Guardian, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said Europe wasn’t ready for a potential conflict with Russia, and the election of NATO-skeptic Donald Trump would expose the bloc to a plethora of risks.

“We are coming from peacetime,” Faury told The Guardian. “I don’t think Europe has yet the level of preparedness that you would need for a conflict between Europe and Russia. Let’s call a spade a spade. And it seems like Russia is ramping up its defense capabilities.”

Faury, a former military helicopter test pilot, explained that the West was coming out of a post–World War II era where defense strategy was focused on deterrence rather than conflict, something that has changed since Russia invaded Ukraine two years ago.

Unfortunately, that 80-year period has coincided with Europe becoming more reliant on the might of an increasingly isolationist U.S.

“We’ve put a lot in the hands of others,” Faury told The Guardian. “We are subcritical on most of the different systems in Europe, we don’t collaborate enough to create investment at scale. We buy mostly from outside of Europe, and mostly from the U.S.”

NATO’s looming Trump threat

Faury told The Guardian that Europe currently had the cushion of the military alliance NATO, but given the saber-rattling during the previous “Trump 1” presidency, the continent should be braced to lose that security blanket were he reelected.

“​​If Trump 2 is of the same nature or even more in terms of the U.S. expecting Europe to take care of itself … we’d better take it seriously.”

Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee for the 2024 U.S. presidential election after his biggest rival, Nikki Haley, withdrew from the race last week.

Polls have shown that Americans favor the former president over incumbent Democrat President Joe Biden, increasing the genuine prospect of a second Trump term four years after he was voted out of the White House.

Trump has repeatedly voiced his disapproval of NATO, and in recent months, his rhetoric has escalated to perhaps its most aggressive on record.

Trump has threatened to pull the U.S. out of NATO if “delinquent” European nations keep failing to contribute 2% of their GDP to the alliance.

“No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You gotta pay. You gotta pay your bills,” Trump said of Russia at a rally in South Carolina in February.

A few days later, Trump was careful not to double down on encouraging Russia to attack U.S. allies but was steadfast in his threats to pull the country out of NATO.

“Look, if they’re not going to pay, we’re not going to protect. Okay?” Trump said.

Faury told The Guardian that Europe needed to become more self-reliant for its military infrastructure, after decades of relying on U.S. makers like Lockheed Martin and Boeing.

Europe’s flagging economy

It’s not just Europe’s security arrangements that are on policymakers’ minds in the event of a second Trump term, but also its economy.

In January, European Central Bank (ECB) chief Christine Lagarde said Trump’s potential reelection posed a “clear threat” to Europe and the continent’s economy.

“You just have to look at the trade tariffs; you just have to look at his commitment regarding NATO; you just have to look at his attitude regarding the battle against climate change.

According to CNBC, Airbus has delivered 79 planes in January and February of 2024, compared to 54 for Boeing.

Multiple troubles, including federal investigations, have brought delays to Boeing’s manufacturing that are beginning to bite with customers. On March 12, Southwest, which exclusively uses Boeing’s 737s, announced its intention to scale back its capacity and rethink its financial outlook for 2024, as it now assumes there will be no 737-7 aircraft deliveries this year[1] . United Airlines also removed the yet-to-be-certified 737 MAX 10 from plans for its own fleet.

This all goes back to a January 5 incident when a door plug on a Boeing 737 MAX blew out right after takeoff out of Portland, forcing an emergency landing, and ultimately leading to months of increased scrutiny and criticism from federal leaders and lawmakers.

Boeing’s woes have only escalated since the door-plug incident, amid a criminal investigation from the Department of Justice, ongoing production delays, and cratering stock prices.

Just days after reports of the DOJ’s investigation surfaced, on March 11 a 787 Dreamliner plunged in mid-flight over New Zealand. Dozens of injuries were reported, after the pilot of the plane said he “temporarily lost control of the aircraft,” according to a report from CNN. It’s unclear what exactly caused the incident, with the airline describing it as a “technical event.”

Then on March 12, it was revealed that Boeing whistleblower John Barnett was found dead from a “self-inflicted” wound in his truck at a hotel car park in Charleston, South Carolina. The 62-year-old worked for the company for more than three decades, before coming forward in 2019, claiming that rushed processes on the assembly line at Boeing’s North Carolina plant had compromised the safety of the 787 Dreamliner.

Barnett was reportedly in South Carolina for legal interviews related to an ongoing lawsuit against Boeing.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9986633062362671}",negative,0.9986633062362671,-1
Airtelis rises to the challenge - Airbus,"Tue, 19 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDI0LTAzLWFpcnRlbGlzLXJpc2VzLXRvLXRoZS1jaGFsbGVuZ2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"2022 was one of the worst years for wildfires in France, with almost 80,000 hectares going up in smoke. In the wake of a dramatic summer, the government decided to reinforce its fleet of water- bombing helicopters (hélicoptères bombardiers d’eau, HBEs) by turning to private operators. The request for proposal launched in October 2022 was for 10 helicopters, including six heavy helicopters, for 2023 to 2026.



“We secured this contract by forming a temporary grouping of companies (Groupement Momentané d'Entreprise, GME) with the SAF1,” explains Laurent Giolitti, Executive President of Airtelis. “Under the terms of the contract signed with public authorities, we each provide three aircraft from the Super Puma family for the fire season, from the beginning of June to the end of September. For our part, we own two of the aircraft we provide, while the third is leased from our partner Heliswiss.”



Powerful and versatile

Airtelis is a longstanding user of the H215 and H225 in France, and already owns four helicopters. Its blue and white helicopters are regularly used at lifting sites, and one has also been leased to the French Air Force since 2017 to train its H225 crews. ""Our helicopters were also well known to the French fire service, as we have been under contract with French Civil Security since 2020,"" notes Laurent Giolitti.



Powerful and versatile, and particularly well suited to slinging heavy loads (up to 4.7 tonnes for the H225), the H215 and H225 make ideal HBEs. The helicopters are equipped with bubble doors to improve pilot visibility, cable cutters and versatile air inlets to protect the engines. “In the HBE configuration, we add radios to communicate with the fire brigade and a siren to alert them of the drop,” he adds. The work is done with a 4,000 litre capacity Bambi Bucket, fitted with an integrated pump and carried by a 30 or 40 metre long sling. In this configuration, the H225 offers around 1 hour and 15 minutes of autonomy.



Our pilots in command are HESLO2 qualified and train with the fire brigade before the fire season. In flight, they are always joined by personnel from the French Civil Security who liaise with the troops on the ground and give operational instructions.



Laurent Giolitti, Executive President of Airtelis

Using the Bambi Bucket with a sling makes it possible to reach water in deep ravines and valleys, while still allowing extremely precise drops close to the flames. This makes the HBE ideal for fighting emerging fires or ‘beating down’ existing ones. Its versatility also means it can move equipment or firefighters if necessary. There is no doubt in our mind that, thanks to their speed of response, flexibility of use and the fact that they can be based extremely close to highrisk areas, with a minimal logistical footprint, HBEs are an excellent complement to Canadair CL415 and Dash 8 water bombers. The contracts signed with the French Civil Security in 2022 also specify that the HBEs can be deployed outside France, so the French fire brigade’s satisfaction now goes beyond borders.



And four for Airtelis

The company based in Avignon (Vaucluse) currently has four Super Puma family helicopters: the two H225s and one H215 were joined at the beginning of November 2023 by an additional H225 purchased secondhand. The helicopter, which entered into service in 2014, had an initial, relatively inactive career in the offshore industry, with just 900 flying hours to its credit. It will be rapidly adapted to lifting activities and benefit from a PBH per flight hour maintenance contract with Airbus Helicopters.

The two-tonne class CityAirbus, has a wingspan of 12m (40ft) and can fly up to 80km (50 miles), reaching a cruise speed of 120km/h (75mph). The four-seater eVTOL aircraft’s design was first revealed in 2019 as an update from earlier work to develop an air taxi and the Vahana R&D program.

At the same time as the unveiling of the prototype Airbus officially opened its new test centre for the CityAirbus in Donauwörth, Germany, which will be used to test eVTOL aircraft systems.

Construction of the Donauwörth test center began in July 2022. Donauwörth is Airbus’ main helicopter production and technology site in Germany, with several hundred engineers working at its development centre. The company developed and makes the H135 and H145 light utility helicopters in Donauwörth.

The eVTOL test centre began operations with the CityAirbus NextGen’s power-on in December 2023. Ground testing will continue there over the coming months, and will cover the electric motors with their eight rotors as well as the aircraft’s other systems such as flight controls and avionics, before the prototype’s maiden flight.

Balkiz Sarihan, head of urban air mobility at Airbus said, “Rolling out CityAirbus NextGen for the very first time is an important and very real step that we are taking towards advanced air mobility and our future product and market. Thank you to our community, team and partners all over the world for helping us make this a reality.”

Airbus recently signed a partnership agreement with aircraft leasing company LCI to focus on the development of partnership scenarios and business models for commercialising and financing the CityAirbus.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999651908874512}",neutral,0.9999651908874512,0

Airbus CFO Thomas Toepfer told CNBC that the company is “obsessed” with making sure its safety and quality standards stay high so it doesn’t have to deal with the same mess that Boeing is stuck in with the 737 Max. The planes were supposed to be the company’s future, but production delays made worse by a 737 Max 9 door plug blowout in January have turned them into a headache.

“The way I would look at it is ... it’s a factor that makes us even think more, how can we make sure that these things will never happen at Airbus?” Toepfer said Thursday.

What has happened is that Airbus stock is up more than 20% so far this year, while Boeing stock is down almost 28%.

Putting the rivalry aside

Airbus told investors last month during an earnings call that the company knows it is in a “very aggressive competition” with Boeing for business from commercial airline companies. Boeing used to be the leader between the two, but since the last 737 Max crisis in 2018, Airbus has taken the industry’s top spot.

A report last week revealed that United Airlines is even leasing Airbus planes while it waits on delayed 737 Max models. But Toepfer told CNBC that his company is still sympathetic to Boeing’s struggles.

“We’re not happy with the issues that our competitor’s having,” he said. “I think it’s not helpful for the industry, and if it’s not helpful for the industry, it’s not helpful for Airbus.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8095510601997375}",positive,0.8095510601997375,1

DALLAS — Korean Air (KE) has signed a contract with French-German aircraft producer Airbus to procure 33 variants of the A350 family. The deal, which includes 27 A350-1000s and six A350-900s, is valued at US$13.7 billion.

The order is intended to supplement KE’s long-term fleet operations as the airline gradually retires its older aircraft. The large procurement of the next-generation, eco-friendly A350 aircraft is not only aligned with KE’s sustainability efforts. Still, it is also seen as a step toward preparing for the merger with newly acquired Asiana Airlines (OZ).

The airline has opted for two Airbus A350 variants since the model is suited to its operations. Owing to its physical location, Korean carriers operate long-haul flights to many of the world’s sought-after destinations. Hence, there is a need for reliable, fuel-efficient long-range aircraft.

Airbus A350 Variants

The A350-1000 is the largest variant in the A350 family and can accommodate between 350 and 410 passengers in a standard three-class configuration. The aircraft uses advanced composite materials, resulting in a reduction in fuel consumption and carbon emissions of up to 25% compared to similarly sized previous-generation aircraft models. With the longest flight range among existing passenger aircraft, the A350-1000 can operate up to 16,000km with full payload.



The A350-900 variant is about 7 meters shorter than the A350-1000 with a range of 15,370km and typically seats 300-350 passengers in a three-class layout. KE might deploy the aircraft on its long-haul services, such as its Seoul Incheon-New York route. The airline currently operates two flights a day on this route.

In addition to the agreement to purchase 33 A350s, KE plans to acquire several other new aircraft, including wide-body and narrow-body aircraft. KE intends to introduce 50 Airbus A321neos, 10 Boeing 787-9s, 20 Boeing 787-10s, and 30 Boeing 737-8s into its fleet.

Korean Air’s latest aircraft order makes financial sense and helps it improve its sustainability targets. The airline will continue prioritizing fleet modernization and reducing carbon emissions by operating new aircraft and other sustainability activities.

But the company is always looking to expand its portfolio.

Airbus on Thursday unveiled the full prototype of its four-seat CityAirbus NextGen to the public. The electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) design makes its debut ahead of its anticipated maiden voyage later this year.

CityAirbus NextGen is a zero-emission, lift-plus-cruise design for a variety of missions in major cities and urban environments, including passenger transport, medical services, and ecotourism. Airbus will partner with operators and airlines to fly the model worldwide.

At first, the eVTOL will be flown by a pilot. But it’s equipped with an operational automated flight mode that could enable autonomous operations in the future.

“Rolling out CityAirbus NextGen for the very first time is an important and very real step that we are taking towards advanced air mobility [AAM] and our future product and market,” said Balkiz Sarihan, head of urban air mobility (UAM) at Airbus.

Airbus revealed the NextGen concept—a descendant of its CityAirbus demonstrator—in 2021. The aircraft is designed for a pilot to fly up to three passengers, with a range of about 50 sm (43 nm) and cruise speed of 75 mph (65 knots). It weighs approximately two tons and has about a 40-foot wingspan.

The NextGen design includes a V-shaped tail, fixed wings, and distributed electric propulsion system, with eight electric propellers and 16 electrical power units. Airbus in 2021 said these features will keep sound levels below 65 dBA during fly-over and below 70 dBA during landing.

The aircraft was built using a mix of in-house and externally supplied components, such as wings from Spirit AeroSystems, flight controls from Thales and Diehl Aerospace, and electric motors from MagicAll.

CityAirbus NextGen will include a human machine interface, with a single piloting stick controlling all aircraft axes and replacing cyclic, pedal, and collective controls. Airbus claims the design is a first in the helicopter industry. Using the stick, a pilot will be able to perform takeoff and landing, climb, descent, acceleration, deceleration, turn, and approach.

Airbus will certify the air taxi in the enhanced category under the European Union Aviation Safety Agency’s (EASA) Special Condition for VTOL (SC-VTOL) regulations. The manufacturer describes these as “the most stringent certification requirements.” FAA certification is expected to follow in the months and years beyond.

The unveiling of the NextGen prototype took place as Airbus opened its CityAirbus test center in Donauwörth, Germany, a site dedicated to eVTOL aircraft development. Donauwörth will host remaining tests of the aircraft’s electric motors, rotors, and other systems such as flight controls and avionics, required before it makes its maiden flight. Airbus began operations at the facility in December after powering on the first NextGen model.

Airbus intends to fly the air taxi in countries such as Italy, Germany, Norway, and Japan, as well as regions such as Latin America. But it will need to establish operational partners and infrastructure such as electric aircraft chargers prior to a rollout.

Recently, the manufacturer expanded its partnership for service in Italy—which already included ITA Airways, nation’s flag carrier—to include vertiport operator UrbanV and green energy firm Enel, which will help airports transition to electric infrastructure.

It also intends to collaborate with international helicopter and fixed-wing lessor LCI to develop business models and partnership scenarios revolving around AAM strategy, commercialization, and financing.

It is, however, the oldest, having set up shop at Mobile Regional Airport in west Mobile in 2005. That’s two years before Airbus opened an engineering center at the Brookley Aeroplex, a forerunner of the massive Final Assembly Lines it would later bring to Brookley.

The Airbus U.S. Military Aircraft facility in west Mobile specializes in MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul) work on aircraft used by various armed forces, including the HC-144A Ocean Sentry used by the U.S. Coast Guard. (Back in 2017, Airbus and Coast Guard officials gathered at the Mobile facility to celebrate a partnership that had supported 100,000 hours of flight time for the Ocean Sentry fleet.)

The news on Wednesday was that the facility was ready to open a brand new hangar adding nearly 18,000 square feet of workspace, bringing the site’s total to around 65,000 square feet. Jose-Antonio De La Fuente, head of Airbus U.S. Military Aircraft, told the crowd of local dignitaries and employees that the operation had doubled its workforce in the last three years.

Rob Geckle, chairman and CEO of Airbus U.S. Space & Defense, said that 140 to 150 people now work at the operation, and expansion continues. The new hangar represented an investment of between $5 million and $10 million, he said.

“Most of the Airbus announcements we get to do are at Brookley,” said Bradley Byrne, president and CEO of the Mobile Chamber. “Today is special because we’re here.”

“You are helping to protect our country and the interests of our country, and we’re grateful to you for that,” said Byrne. “But what this does to our economy in terms of being able to offer an ever-widening array of aviation services, aviation production, is huge. Mobile has become a center for aviation excellence in the world and you are a big part of that.”

Chris Curry, president of the Mobile Airport Authority, said the authority’s job “primarily is to create an environment where businesses like Airbus Space & Defense can flourish.”

“I’m frequently asked the question, what are you going to do with the regional airport?” Curry said, referring to plans to build a new international airport at Brookley and relocate commercial passenger services there in late 2025. “I gently remind them that we do have the Coast Guard aviation training unit and Airbus Space & Defense here at the Mobile Regional Airport.”

The upcoming swap would seem to promise more room for growth, for an operation already based at the regional field.

“It’s going to free up more space for many more opportunities,” said Curry. “I think Airbus Space & Defense expansion is just one, but there’s a lot of other abilities for an airport that is in the shape that this airport is in.”

“I think it’s an opportunity,” said Geckle. “I mean, we will support whatever the local authority wants to do with the space. But if we can help as this moves towards [being an] MRO center of excellence, it fits in well with our growth plan and not necessarily just the U.S. fleet. I mean, if you have aircraft in Latin America, this could make sense to service them from here as well.”

Geckle said it’s a challenge finding qualified new employees, partly because the work must meet exacting standards.

“What we do is amazing,” he said. “When you’re talking about modifying or repairing, overhauling an existing aircraft and pulling out the avionics (aircraft electronics), you have to know how the aircraft is built and then you also have to know what these components can withstand in terms of repairing. So it’s highly qualified folks that we’re looking to hire. These are high-tech jobs, well-paying jobs.”

De La Fuente said some of the classes of workers needed include structural mechanics, electrical engineers and aircraft mechanics.

“Talking broadly, because of the rapid growth in the area, huge growth in the area, finding the workforce is a challenge,” he said. “There are a lot of projects in Mobile in different industries, but the common factor is that there is fast growth. So that puts some challenges on the, you know, trying to find the resources, the workforce.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998277425765991}",neutral,0.9998277425765991,0
"Breeze Airways Focuses On Long, Thin Routes With Airbus A220-300s - Aviation Week","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcnBvcnRzLW5ldHdvcmtzL2JyZWV6ZS1haXJ3YXlzLWZvY3VzZXMtbG9uZy10aGluLXJvdXRlcy1haXJidXMtYTIyMC0zMDBz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Breeze Airways founder and CEO David Neeleman believes the U.S. airline, launched in 2021, can eventually operate as many as 2,000 routes, 10 times the 200 it currently flies.

Neeleman cited the figure in February when discussing Breeze’s decision to exercise options for 10 Airbus A220-300s. The airline currently operates 22 A220-300s, and expects to have 32 in its fleet by the end of 2024 and 90 by the end 2028.

During a conference call with reporters, Neeleman said the airline will operate only A220-300s on scheduled service flights by the end of this year, with its 10 Embraer E190s to be dedicated to charter flights.

Neeleman pointed to the A220-200’s range, noting it can fly nonstop routes of up to 3,400 nautical miles and describing it as the ideal aircraft for long, thin routes. “We can easily go transcon,” he said.

The airline continues to focus on routes connecting larger airports to smaller markets, including transcontinental services. Recent route announcements have included service between Denver and Providence, Rhode Island; between Los Angeles and Greenville-Spartanburg, South Carolina; and between San Diego and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina.

“Breeze’s business model is to bring air service to underserved markets across the U.S., so the vast majority of our routes have no nonstop competition,” Neeleman said, adding the “economics of the A220 are integral to that success, which enables thin routes to be profitable.”

Neeleman said it was necessary to exercise options to ensure Breeze has the capacity to grow. With A220 production slots in high demand, “you have to exercise options to get in line,” he explained. “We didn’t want to wait until 2025.”

Breeze configures its A220-300s with 137 seats, including 12 premium seats with 39-inch pitch. Neeleman said the airline is considering expanding to 16 premium seats on the aircraft. “Passengers want to be upgraded,” he noted.

The carrier, which is not publicly traded, will be profitable this year, according to Neeleman. “When you start an airline, revenue is at an all-time low and cost is at an all-time high,” he said. “When you spread the overhead across more airplanes, the cost comes down.”

Neeleman said Breeze is quickly building customer bases at the airports it serves. “On routes we’ve been on for over six months, 25% of the traffic is repeat,” he explained.

“So, that repeat business really drives profitability and then your average fares go up a little bit, and then you have this transition point where you cross and you become breakeven and then you start making a profit … We fully anticipate making a profit this year and then continue to make a profit.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999982476234436}",neutral,0.999982476234436,0
"Korean Air close to ordering Airbus A350 widebodies, considering more A321neos - AeroTime","Mon, 18 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMva29yZWFuLWFpci1jb25zaWRlcnMtb3JkZXItYWlyYnVzLWEzNTDSAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy5hZXJvdGltZS5hZXJvL2FydGljbGVzL2tvcmVhbi1haXItY29uc2lkZXJzLW9yZGVyLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Korean Air is reportedly close to placing a “significant” order with Airbus for its A350 widebodied long-haul aircraft. The Seoul-based carrier is planning the order as part of a fleet restructuring program that will take effect once its long-awaited merger with Asiana Airlines has been finalized.

The airline plans to buy around 20 A350 jets, according to sources close to the negotiations who spoke to Bloomberg. The agreement could be announced as soon as March 2024, although the final decision rests with the outcome of a board meeting being held by the airline’s executives on March 21, 2024.

The new aircraft could be used to replace at least some of the carrier’s aging Boeing 777-200ER and 777-300 fleets. The shorter fuselage 777-200ERs, of which the airline has eight, have an average age of 18.8 years old. The company also has four 777-300s with an average age of 24.8 years. It also employs 25 777-300ERs which average 9.8 years old. Asiana currently operates 15 A350s, with a further 15 on order.

The order would mark Korean Air’s first widebody purchase since 2019 and be seen to be a big success for Airbus, as Korean Air has traditionally relied upon Boeing for providing the bulk of the aircraft in its long-haul fleet.

A spokesperson for Korean Air told Bloomberg that the carrier was unable to comment on any potential order at this point. Meanwhile, an Airbus spokesperson said the planemaker does not comment on “discussions we may or may not be having with airlines”.

In addition to a potential widebody order, Korean Air is also said to be mulling over the addition of further A321neo single-aisle planes, of which it already operates 41 of the type. The carrier already placed a multi-million-dollar top-up order for 20 of the type in October 2023, taking its total outstanding order for the popular narrowbody to 50. Asiana operates 21 A321 with a further 16 on order.

Korean Air currently has 162 aircraft in its fleet with a further 183 on order. Although Airbus appears to be the front runner for the new widebody order, the airline has been considering the disposal of its small fleet of A220 twinjets of which it has 10.

According to Korean Air’s CEO Walter Cho, the airline has also been evaluating Boeing’s 777X. However, with that aircraft not due for certification until sometime in 2025, plus other production issues that have affected Boeing in recent months, Korean Air may be holding off ordering the type for some time yet.

Korean Air’s pending acquisition of Asiana, valued at $1.4 billion, is now just awaiting US regulatory approval, having already received approvals from authorities representing 13 of the 14 jurisdictions in which it is required. US approval is expected before the end of 2024.

The enlarged Korean Air is aiming to simplify the number of aircraft types it operates to simplify operations and reduce overall costs.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999920129776001}",neutral,0.9999920129776001,0

The lease agreement was initially planned for just eight months but has been extended slightly by a few months.

Surinam Airways has issued a press release announcing the exit of its only Airbus A340-300. According to the statement, the aircraft is set to leave PY’s fleet on 24 March 2024. It will be returned to its lessor, V2 Aviation

The airline has a small fleet of two Boeing 737-800 aircraft and the leased Airbus A340-300, which will leave its fleet in the coming weeks. The airline intends to replace this with another long-haul, wide-body aircraft.

Wide-body Aircraft for Long Haul Route

Scramble reports that PY seeks to purchase a suitable aircraft for scheduled long-haul flights to Europe. However, Surinam Airways will wet-lease an Airbus A330-200 from Maleth Aero until it secures an appropriate plane. This aircraft will operate PY’s flights between PBM and Amsterdam (AMS).

Surinam’s national carrier operates a compact route network comprising several regional destinations. From its hub in PBM, the airline offers scheduled flights to destinations including Aruba (AUA), Barbados (BGI), Belem (BEL), Curacao (CUR), Timehri (GEO) and Miami (MIA). The airline also operates Fifth and Seventh Freedom flights. It is permitted to carry passengers between specific destinations outside of Surinam.

The carrier offers scheduled flights on only one long-haul route. Having close ties with the Netherlands, the airline operates direct services between PBM and AMS.

Icelandair Selects Viasat for High-Speed Wi-Fi on Airbus A321LR - Business Traveler USA,"Wed, 06 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3N0cmF2ZWxlcnVzYS5jb20vbmV3cy9pY2VsYW5kYWlyLXNlbGVjdHMtdmlhc2F0LWZvci1haXJidXMtYTMyMWxyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Passengers flying on Icelandair’s new Airbus aircraft will enjoy high-speed Wi-Fi onboard thanks to the airline’s partnership with satellite communications provider Viasat.

In a press release, the internet service provider announced that the Icelandic flag carrier has chosen its Wi-Fi solutions to keep its passengers connected when flying with its new fleet of Airbus A321LR aircraft.

Icelandair is scheduled to take delivery of these brand-new long-range planes during the fourth quarter of 2024, and they are expected to be used to operate several routes from Iceland to both Europe and North America.

Viasat uses its own network of satellites to deliver reliable high-speed internet. It also has the ability to flex its satellite capacity to meet concentrations of intense demand, eliminating instances when passengers find their connection slowing down when sharing bandwidth with the rest of the cabin.

This consistent, high-speed connectivity will allow passengers to seamlessly browse the internet and stream entertainment such as movies, TV shows, and music on their own devices from the minute they board the plane.

Icelandair currently uses Viasat technology to deliver high-speed internet on its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft fleet, having first partnered in 2021.

Currently, passengers in economy class can purchase access to a single Wi-Fi device for €10 ($10.87) on flights between Iceland and Europe and €20 ($21.75) on flights between Iceland and the U.S. or Canada.

Frequent flyers can also pay for the service using Saga Points, while Saga Premium Saga Premium Flex passengers, as well as Saga Gold members, can get complimentary access on up to two devices.

“By expanding our high-speed streaming Wi-Fi offering to the new aircraft, we are doubling down on the state-of-the-art connectivity that has become a highly sought-after element of the Icelandair passenger experience,” said Helga Huld Bjarnadóttir, Icelandair’s Director of Product and Service Management.

“Viasat has proven to be an innovative and trusted partner for how we approach the future of Wi-Fi at Icelandair, and we look forward to continuing this into the future.”

Don Buchman, VP and GM of Commercial Aviation at Viasat, said: “For several years now, we have enjoyed a great partnership with Icelandair while servicing its complete Boeing 737 MAX fleet.

“We understand the patterns of Icelandair’s operation and passenger demand for in-flight Wi-Fi, and we are excited to extend this experience and trust to include fast and resilient connectivity on the new Airbus aircraft.”

Viasat is one of the most popular providers of high-speed onboard Wi-Fi in the world and is currently available on JetBlue and United Airlines flights, while it is coming to Qantas flights soon. And now, passengers can expect it on Icelandair by the end of the year. Icelandair serves 14 U.S. destinations, including New York (JFK), Boston (BOS), Chicago (ORD), Washington (IAD), and Denver (DEN), as well as three in Canada.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.997043788433075}",neutral,0.997043788433075,0
