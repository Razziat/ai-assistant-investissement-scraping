Airbus and Dassault Systèmes embark on strategic partnership to create the European aerospace industry of tomorrow - Dassault Systèmes,"Wed, 06 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy4zZHMuY29tL25ld3Nyb29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1cy1hbmQtZGFzc2F1bHQtc3lzdGVtZXMtZW1iYXJrLXN0cmF0ZWdpYy1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcC1jcmVhdGUtZXVyb3BlYW4tYWVyb3NwYWNlLWluZHVzdHJ5LXRvbW9ycm930gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 6 February 2019 – Airbus and Dassault Systèmes have signed a five-year Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) to cooperate on the implementation of collaborative 3D design, engineering, manufacturing, simulation and intelligence applications. This will enable Airbus to take a major step forward in its digital transformation and lay the foundation for a new European industrial ecosystem in aviation.

Under the MOA, Airbus will deploy Dassault Systèmes’ 3DEXPERIENCE platform, which delivers digital continuity, from design to operations, in a single data model for a unified user experience, making digital design, manufacturing and services (DDMS) a company-wide reality for all Airbus divisions and product lines.

DDMS paves the way for breakthroughs in new product design, operational performance, support and maintenance, customer satisfaction and new business models, as it represents a move from sequential to parallel development processes. Instead of first focusing on product performance, Airbus will be able to co-design and develop the next generation of aircraft with the manufacturing facilities that will produce them, reducing costs and time to market.

“We are not just talking about digitalisation or a 3D experience, we are rethinking the way aircraft are designed and operated, streamlining and speeding up our processes with customer satisfaction in mind,” said Guillaume Faury, President Airbus Commercial Aircraft. “DDMS is a catalyst for change and with it we are building a new model for the European aerospace industry with state of the art technology. Our target is a robust production setup that offers a reduction in product development lead time.”

“Nothing exemplifies the intersection of technology, science and art more than aviation. When we reflect on how the industry has evolved to where it is today, it’s a blend of technical prowess, digital precision and inspiration,” said Bernard Charlès, Vice Chairman and CEO, Dassault Systèmes. “The Aerospace industry has a proven track record of fast transformation, faster than in most industries. It delivers high quality innovation and new services for operations in highly complex and regulated environments. The 3DEXPERIENCE platform will accelerate the digital transformation of Airbus. Airbus can capture insights and expertise from across its ecosystem to deliver new experiences that only the digital world makes possible.”"
Too big to sell: Airbus bids pained adieu to superjumbo A380 - The Associated Press,"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzAzNTI4MzE2NjU3MjQ3Zjc4ZThkZDlhMzdhOTI5Nzc50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TOULOUSE, France (AP) — To passengers, the A380 feels immediately different — spacious, smooth and oddly elegant for a jet so gargantuan. Yet to Airbus, it’s become a burden so super-sized that the European manufacturer is ending its production for good.

The A380 is simply too big to sell. With funereal faces, Airbus CEO Tom Enders and other executives made a stunning yet long-anticipated admission Thursday that it was the wrong product at the wrong time, created to feed a demand for 800-seat jets that never materialized.

Less than 14 years after its maiden flight, barely a decade after it started carrying passengers, the A380 is being mothballed.

Just 17 more of the planes will be completed, wrapping up in 2021. Emirates, its last and most loyal customer, said Thursday it’s switching to smaller planes instead.

Distraught fans — even within Airbus’ own ranks — decried the decision. Unions in Britain, Spain and France fear for the 3,500 jobs Airbus says it might threaten.

One of the jetliner’s first test pilots took a more philosophical view. While he’s “feeling a bit sad” about the news, Claude Lelaie says the giant plane will be remembered for pushing the barriers of aviation, like the supersonic Concorde.

“Both made history and allowed progress, technological progress,” he told The Associated Press from the southern French city of Toulouse, the cradle of Airbus’ worldwide operations. “That’s business — you have to ensure the success of the company.”

This isn’t how things were supposed to pan out for the world’s biggest passenger jet.

Development talks for the plane began in 2000, meant to be Airbus’ 21st-century answer to rival Boeing’s 1960s-era 747, and one of the most ambitious endeavors in aviation. Its Rolls Royce engines were quieter than ever, far out on the extra-long wings. Carbon-fiber technology was used for the body to make it lighter and easier to maneuver. Its double-decker construction allowed room for bars, duty-free shops and even showers.

Lelaie was a co-pilot aboard the maiden flight of the superjumbo in 2005, 101 years after the Wright brothers’ first flight.

Despite its huge size and weight, he called the A380 a “very nice aircraft to fly” — even on special low-speed flights when they deliberately stalled the plane to test its reactions.

Then French President Jacques Chirac hailed the plane as “a symbol of what Europeans can do together.” Airbus’ then chief salesman, John Leahy, called it “game-changing” for the industry.

Yet to detractors, the A380 smacked of hubris, a vanity project by managers who saw bigger as better despite an uncertain market for a plane so huge that airports had to modify their runways and gates.

It faced repeated production setbacks and cost overruns. Order cancellations led to a restructuring at Airbus that saw thousands of job cuts.

One emblematic problem: a standoff between German and French engineers over which software to use to design the cockpit. The company lost a quarter of its market value in a single day in 2006 when the resulting delays became public.

Enders says the A380 wasn’t a flight of folly but a carefully studied gamble.

“We didn’t stumble into it,” he said. “Little did we know how the world would look in 2010, in 2019.”

Airlines in fact seemed more interested in mid-size planes for regional routes, notably in Asia, where travel within the region has boomed in recent years. Even on longer routes, airlines seemed to prefer smaller planes that were easier to fill.

Salesman Leahy spent much of the 2000s trying to persuade customers not to cancel orders. The last major order was in 2013, from trusted Emirates.

Enders said he was “knee-deep” in the A380, and personally suffered from its failures, but the only way to get out of this “trap” was to say good-bye.

“The 380 may have just been too large of a step for the market to handle,” said Rob Watts, CEO of aviation consulting company Aerotask.

The end came Thursday, as Airbus and Emirates announced that the airline had decided to transfer existing orders for A380s to smaller A350s and A320s.

The chairman and CEO of Emirates, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al Maktoum, said: “While we are disappointed to have to give up our order, and sad that the program could not be sustained, we accept that this is the reality of the situation.”

The A380 has been the backbone of the Emirates fleet, based out of Dubai, the world’s busiest airport for international travel.

The pall of grief at Airbus headquarters was tinged with a hint of relief, after years of straining to keep the A380 alive.

Airbus quietly prepared for the decision a year ago, building in the 463 million euros ($522 million) in losses the A380 cost the company last year into its 2018 financial results, announced Thursday. The company posted a jump in profit and upbeat forecast for the coming year despite a slew of challenges, including Britain’s pending exit from the European Union without a new trade deal.

Even though the A380 wiped billions off Airbus profits in its development phase, Chief Financial Officer Harald Wilhelm says the company is expecting to break even on the overall program before it’s scrapped.

Airbus, which has some 130,000 employees worldwide, is focusing on its many other planes, made in facilities from Mobile, Alabama, to Tianjin, China.

Among those who foresaw the A380’s demise was analyst Richard Aboulafia of Washington-based Teal Group.

“But thanks to the strength of the market right now, and the strength of Airbus’s other products, the damage will not have a huge impact on the industry,” he told the AP. “For Boeing, it has been a very long time since they needed to worry about the A380 as a competitive factor.”

The A380 is still among the youngest aircraft in the skies, and Airbus will maintain the more than 230 planes currently in service for years to come. Guillaume Faury, who takes over from Enders as CEO in April, promised: “It will continue to fly.”

But the era of ever larger jets, and the romantic idea of continent-hopping travel they inspired, came to an unofficial end with the announcement by Airbus on Thursday that it plans to cease production of the A380, the largest passenger airliner ever built.

An engineering marvel expansive enough for showers and sleekly designed bars, the planes hark back to the age when flying had glamour. The four engines are powerful enough to reach cruising altitude in roughly 15 minutes, all the while keeping noise to a tolerable hum. There are fan clubs for the A380 on both Twitter and Facebook.

But for years, the jet has been far more popular with passengers than airlines. When it debuted in 2005, the A380 was a bet that the future of air travel was big planes flying between major hubs, followed by connectors to final destinations.

Instead, the dominant trend became smaller planes and direct flights. Dropping $445 million for a jet — the A380’s list price — that can carry more than 500 people made little economic sense, especially as budget airlines cropped up as competition."

Why did the Airbus A380 fail? - WIRED,"Sat, 16 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9haXJidXMtYTM4MC1mYWlsdXJlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Getty Images

The rapid demise of the Airbus A380 is a complex tale of missed connections, a changing market and, ultimately, a staggering lack of demand for the largest commercial airplane ever built. And, as a result, this giant of the skies could well be the last of its kind.

The decision to stop production on the A380 came after Emirates, which operates more than half of all flights using the plane, halved its latest order. After being in production for a little over 12 years, the A380 will go down as one of the shortest-lived models in aviation history. But why did it fail?

To understand that, you first need to understand how Airbus hoped it would succeed. The thought process behind the aircraft’s design – specifically, its size – had two major threads. The first, argues John Grant, director of JG Aviation Consultants, was “a strategic desire to distance themselves from being just another Boeing.” (Boeing had released a smaller aircraft, the 787 Dreamliner, at the same time back in 2007). To an extent, that worked. So far so good.

The second problem was a gamble on the future of the market. “It was designed to solve an expected problem”, says Keith Mason, Professor of Air Transport Management at Cranfield University, who assessed Boeing and Airbus’s differences in philosophy back in 2007. Airbus’s logic here was simple: if the industry continued to grow at the expected rate – Mason says passenger numbers typically double every 15 years – then airports would be overwhelmed by the sheer number of people. A large plane, so the argument went, would help ease this bottleneck by picking up more people per flight while also maximising value for pricey landing slots. This prediction proved to be wrong. “Airport congestion hasn’t happened,” says Mason. In fact, airport capacity in many markets, especially Asia, has grown.

The A380’s failure is also a result of a switch in the aviation world towards smaller, more efficient aircraft. Boeing’s B787, for example, seats around half as many passengers as the A380. In fact, Emirates, as it cut back on the A380, placed a large order of Airbus’s own saller A350 and A330. Grant points out that these aircraft offer “better operating economics, lower costs, smaller capacity and therefore less pressure to fill every seat”.

The sheer size and luxury of the A380 also played a role in its undoing. The plane, which is estimated to have cost $25bn (£19.4bn) to develop, runs on a capacity of 320,000 litres of fuel, packs four 70,000lb thrust engines, carries 555 passengers over two decks and 500 square meters of floor space, and has a duty free shop, bar restaurant and beauty salon."
Stepping into the virtual world to enhance aircraft maintenance - Airbus,"Fri, 08 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE5LTAyLXN0ZXBwaW5nLWludG8tdGhlLXZpcnR1YWwtd29ybGQtdG8tZW5oYW5jZS1haXJjcmFmdC1tYWludGVuYW5jZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Determining the best way to maintain, repair or replace an aircraft component in crowded or tight environments – such as the avionics compartment or an engine pylon – could be a challenge. With digital technologies, it’s as easy as putting on a pair of virtual reality glasses.

​Virtual reality (VR) brings real benefits and value, making it possible to simulate and reproduce situations in a safe environment that would otherwise be costly, complex or even dangerous. In recent years, virtual and augmented reality have become more mobile and easier to use than ever, creating the potential to completely transform many areas of business.

Airbus has been at the forefront of virtual and augmented reality technologies in the industry, implementing VR software tools throughout the aircraft design process, as well as on the digital shop floor and for inspection purposes.

Adapting existing Airbus VR programmes for new maintenance operations

During an aircraft’s design and development phases – and when modifications or updates are implemented – Airbus engineers need to check and improve the feasibility of the related maintenance activities. The aim is to support high levels of operational reliability and minimise direct maintenance costs for airlines.

This has generally been done with traditional digital technologies such as CATIA (a computer-based modelling system), and the DMU (digital mock-up). Depending on the situation, physical verification also can be performed on the aircraft for more complicated items and processes at a later phase in the development. The downsides of these traditional verification methods are their requirements in cost, time and engineers’ experience.

To seek more efficient maintenance validation methods, Stephane Benazet, Head of Fuselage and Pylon Operability and Design Maturity, worked with Airbus’ IT teams to explore new technologies – partnering with augmented and virtual reality architect Xavier Laville to adapt existing Airbus virtual reality programmes in meeting the needs of an operability engineer.

For many years, Airbus' RHEA (Realistic Human Experiment Analysis) rooms have offered a full-scale, immersive experience based on the aircraft's digital mock-up – where cameras are used to track sensors installed on the user's arms and legs, while the headset accurately displays the body movements. Now, the team has created a “portable RHEA” kit that includes a virtual reality mask, touch pads and two infrared cameras, allowing users to work in a similar immersive environment without leaving their desks.

Virtual reality is truly helping us with our real daily tasks, while reducing time and costs.

- Stephane Benazet, Head of Fuselage and Pylon Operability and Design Maturity

""This technology puts you in the place of an airline mechanic,"" explains Benazet. ""If there's an issue that does not let you gain access or remove a component – the system won't let you do it.""

In addition to portability, the VR-based system has further advantages: learning how to use it takes just one day. “The feedback has been great,"" says Laville. ""It's a beautiful technology that enables users to perform verification and validation activities in just 25% of the time needed for traditional CATIA and DMU methods.""

Training and deployment are set to begin in 2019. ""We can optimise procedures and tasks included in service bulletins – such as those before launching retrofits on in-service aircraft, for pre-design, or for system architecture reviews,” added Benazet. “We have engineers in multiple countries, so the portability and accessibility of RHEA lets us deploy the system wherever we have people, reducing onboard physical verification."""
Airbus A380: from high-tech marvel to commercial flop - The Conversation Indonesia,"Tue, 19 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS9haXJidXMtYTM4MC1mcm9tLWhpZ2gtdGVjaC1tYXJ2ZWwtdG8tY29tbWVyY2lhbC1mbG9wLTExMjA4NtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This time it really is over. Airbus chief executive, Tom Enders, recently announced the end of the A380, the largest commercial aircraft ever built. Despite reported investments of more than €14 billion, this iconic European project has not been as successful as was originally hoped. With only 234 units delivered out of 313 ordered over 13 years, it is far from the break-even point – originally estimated at 1,200 aircraft over 20 years. With orders drying up and production already running at a minimum, it was time for Airbus to stop the damage.

Long before its launch date, the A380 appeared to represent the future of Airbus, which anticipated that air traffic would double in the next 20 years. That’s why it is both big – it can carry anywhere from 550 to more than 800 passengers on two full decks – and luxurious, with options such as private rooms, restaurants and bars – even an in-flight casino. Its engines are on average 30% more powerful than those of the Boeing 747 and are worth €13 million each – the value of a ton of gold for all four.

To keep the overall weight down, the A380’s designers used groundbreaking composite structure, including carbon ribs within aluminium wings. Equipped with the most advanced navigation system in commercial aviation, it can operate for more than 13 hours and fly more than 9,000 miles.

The aircraft is built on a continental scale: the wings are made in Wales, engines are made in England (Rolls Royce) or the US (Engine Alliance), the fuselage and the vertical stabiliser is built in Germany and the horizontal stabiliser in Spain. Final assembly is carried out in France. Each wing weighs 6.5 tons and is composed of tens of thousands of components, carrying the fuel, supporting the fuselage and channelling the power of the engines.

Niche market

If the A380 is undeniably one of the most impressive aircraft of all time, its unique design and distributed production system created numerous technical and coordination problems. The initial launch was delayed 18 months by a range of difficulties, and the ability of airlines to customise the aircraft proved to be an additional source of delays.

While the A380’s first flight – on April 7 2005 – was a success, the market was already changing. Airlines that initially favoured big hubs such as Singapore and Dubai began to offer more direct flights from a significant number of middle-sized airports. The rise of low-cost airlines brought in influential new players and weakening the long-time leaders that had been seen as big prospects for the A380.

Most importantly, the 2008 economic crisis seriously cut into the growth in air traffic. While growth has returned, the market is smaller than expected, making it harder to fill a wide-body aircraft, much less a double-deck one. It is simply not profitable for an airline to have flights with less than 80% of the seats filled. Emirates, which owns half of all operating A380s, has the financial resources to take on this risk, but not other carriers.

It was Airbus’ mimicry of its historic competitor, Boeing, that led to the gap between supply and a considerably evolved demand. While some experts claimed that the A380 was 10 to 20 years ahead of the market, Airbus executives now admit that the plane was 10 years too late. As Enders said when announcing the A380’s demise: “What we are seeing here is the end of the large four-engine aircraft.”

With A380 sales lagging, Airbus launched its new mid-size flagship, the A350, in 2014. It and Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner, both of which have only two engines yet can fly great distances, were preferred because they had lower costs and fewer constraints than the A380.

A380 orders started to dry up in 2015 and persistent rumours suggested that the end was near. There were no orders from US carriers, few in Asia and even Air France halved its anticipated A380 fleet. On January 15 2018, John Leahy, Airbus’ chief commercial officer, declared that if Emirates didn’t order at least 30 more A380s, it wouldn’t be possible to keep the program alive. British Airways, which owns a dozen A380s, has suggested that it could acquire others, but only if Airbus was “aggressive on the pricing”. Whatever the result of those discussions, they are unlikely to alter the company’s decision.

An inevitable disaster?

Today, the very design of the A380 is being questioned – that it was in many ways a delusion of grandeur by Airbus, which wanted at all costs to beat the Boeing 747. But its four engines consumed too much fuel, and being able to carry more passengers wasn’t enough to make up the difference. The A380’s immense size and double-deck layout also require airport investments not needed for other airliners.

Without the support of Emirates, which has made the A380 its flagship and is probably the only company that will regret its end, the decision to cease production would have been made a long time ago. Emirates has agreed to convert part of its latest order to A330neo and A350 aircraft, remaining faithful to Airbus. The last delivery is scheduled for 2021 and there will be no new versions brought into service. Meanwhile, the Boeing 747 celebrates 50 years of service – though it too is ending production, marking the end of an era for airline behemoths.

The end of the A380 is not necessarily good news for Boeing: it releases Airbus from a weight that has long prevented it from delivering its full potential. Resources and skills can be better allocated and thousands of workers may be offered jobs on other production lines. If the end of the A380 is a hard blow, the end of the story has yet to be written for Airbus."
What Killed the Biggest Passenger Plane Ever Flown? - New York Magazine,"Thu, 21 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbnltYWcuY29tL2ludGVsbGlnZW5jZXIvMjAxOS8wMi93aGF0LWtpbGxlZC10aGUtYWlyYnVzLTM4MC10aGUtYmlnZ2VzdC1wbGFuZS1ldmVyLWZsb3duLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A380.

The Airbus A380 is awesome and huge — the biggest passenger plane ever made, in fact. But less than 12 years after its entry into service, airlines feel they have enough of them. With orders having slowed to a trickle, Airbus has announced a wind down in production.

To understand why, look to this 2017 Business Insider interview with Qantas CEO Alan Joyce, where he explains why even newer planes have quickly rendered the A380 inappropriate for many of the uses airlines thought they might have for it.

An A380 seats 484 passengers, as configured for the Australian airline, meaning it has a bit more than twice the capacity of a Qantas Boeing 787. And Joyce told BI that Qantas can operate two 787s for a bit less than the cost of running one A380, meaning the airline’s per-passenger cost is actually lower if it splits passengers up into the smaller planes. Given the obvious flexibility of using multiple planes instead of one — you can fly them at different times, or to different destinations — why would any airline want the giant plane?

The theory behind the A380, as Airbus was conceiving it almost 20 years ago, was that airlines would continue to serve passengers through increasingly congested hub airports like London Heathrow and Los Angeles International, and that ever larger planes would be necessary to cope with the limited number of daily takeoffs and landings these airports could handle. Instead, air traffic grew more slowly than expected, and the rise of long point-to-point routes to secondary cities, increasingly operated by 787 or Airbus’s own A350, took pressure off the largest hubs.

In a way, the A380 was a victim of Airbus’s own success. Around the same time it was rolling out the superjumbo jet, Airbus was — along with Boeing — developing a midsize jet that made superjumbos less necessary. The A350, like the 787, is a wide-body jet for about 250 to 300 passengers. These planes are built in large part out of lightweight composite materials, and they have super fuel-efficient engines that allow them to travel similarly long distances as the A380 while burning less fuel per passenger. They are small enough to provide economically viable service on “long and thin” routes like Boston to Seoul and Los Angeles to Qingdao. And passengers will pay a premium for the opportunity to fly these routes nonstop.

Even on ultra-high-volume routes between the world’s busiest airports, where you would think airlines could easily fill a 500-passenger plane, consumer demand for high flight frequencies has led many carriers to continue using smaller planes. New York to London is the busiest transoceanic airline route in the world; on a given Friday, six airlines operate 31 flights from New York-Kennedy or Newark Liberty to London Heathrow or London Gatwick. Not one of those flights is operated with an A380. That’s because an airline that chose to operate, say, three daily A380 flights on the route would lose customers to its competitors, which run five or more flights a day on smaller jets, allowing customers to leave almost exactly when they want.

It’s not that the A380 has no valid uses. Not every carrier finds the cost comparison to be as stark as Qantas does. Jet fuel is heavy, and when a long-range plane takes off with enough fuel to fly almost halfway around the world, it’s burning a lot of fuel just to carry fuel. For this reason, a 12-hour flight requires much more fuel than two six-hour flights. Oliver Lamb, managing director for Ailevon Pacific, which consults with airports and airlines about route development, told me the 787’s fuel-efficiency advantage over the A380 is especially great on these ultralong routes — a style of flight toward which Qantas’s network is especially weighted.

For airlines whose long-haul flights are shorter, the A380 can make more sense, especially if the flights go in or out of congested airports where landing slots are at a premium. British Airways doesn’t fly A380s to New York, but it does use them on other routes where frequency is less essential. And not every airline is all-in on the point-to-point model. Emirates, which expects most passengers to connect in Dubai, operates about half the A380s in the world.

In that 2017 interview, Joyce even identified circumstances where the A380 is the best choice for Qantas: routes where it can’t get enough landing slots to operate as frequently as it would like, and routes where a scheduling concern (such as the need to not take off or land at 3 a.m.) limits the airline’s ability to spread traffic over widely spaced frequencies throughout the day. But the airline already has 12 A380s, and that seems to be enough. Earlier this month, Qantas formally canceled its order for eight more of the planes. Even Emirates is only going to buy so many.

In the end, Airbus expects to sell 251 A380s — one more than the manufacturer initially said it would need to make to break even on the program, though the Wall Street Journal notes that target was set before the plane became plagued with cost overruns and delays.

Coincidentally, 251 is just one more than the number of L-1011 TriStar jets that Lockheed Martin produced from the late 1960s into the 1980s. The three-engine L-1011 was part of the first wave of wide-body aircraft, launching just two years after the even larger Boeing 747. It became a fleet mainstay for some U.S. carriers, especially Delta, but was widely regarded as a commercial failure. Lockheed quit the passenger aircraft business after ending that program.

But Lamb thinks Airbus may have just been ahead of its time with the A380.

“We are not building new airports in the U.S.,” he said. “What happens to the Los Angeles and New York markets in 20 years? How do they keep flying with 3 percent annual growth, already pushing capacity limits, and no realistic way to grow runway slots and gates at 3 percent per year?”

Those capacity limits will be addressable in the near future by moving up from planes much smaller than the A380 to larger planes that are still smaller than the A380. Airlines can replace regional jets with Boeing 737s, and 767s with A350s. But in the long run, the time for the superjumbo jet may come again."

Airbus is giving up on the A380 - CNN,"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAxOS8wMi8xNC9idXNpbmVzcy9hMzgwLWFpcmJ1cy1uZXdzLWVtaXJhdGVzL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"London CNN Business —

Airbus will stop making the A380, pulling the plug on its iconic superjumbo jet that once promised to revolutionize commercial air travel but failed to deliver on outsized expectations.

The European plane maker said Thursday that it will stop delivering A380s in 2021 after its key customer, Dubai-based airline Emirates, slashed its orders for the world’s largest airliner.

“It’s a painful decision,” Airbus CEO Tom Enders said during a conference call with analysts. “We’ve invested a lot of effort, a lot of resources and a lot of sweat into this aircraft.”

“But obviously we need to be realistic,” he added. “With the decision of Emirates to reduce orders, our order backlog is not sufficient to sustain production.”

The decision could hit as many as 3,500 jobs at the manufacturer, whose operations span four major European countries, over the next three years.

The A380 was developed at a cost of $25 billion and first took to the skies 14 years ago. But the giant bet that airlines would need a plane that can carry up to 853 passengers between major airport hubs didn’t pay off.

The company has delivered 234 of the superjumbos to date, less than a quarter of the 1,200 it predicted it would sell when it first introduced the double-decker aircraft. Its plans were undermined by airlines shifting their interest to lighter, more fuel efficient passenger jets that have reduced the need to ferry passengers between the big hubs.

“Passengers all over the world love to fly on this great aircraft. Hence today’s announcement is painful for us and the A380 communities worldwide,” Enders said in a statement. “But keep in mind that A380s will still roam the skies for many years to come and Airbus will of course continue to fully support the A380 operators.”

Shares in Airbus (EADSF) surged 5% on Thursday after it reported its 2018 earnings and the A380 news. Net profit increased 30% over the previous year to €3.1 billion ($3.5 billion). Sales jumped to €63.7 billion ($71.7 billion).

The company said it hoped to deliver 880 to 890 commercial aircraft during 2019, more than some analysts had expected. US rival Boeing (BA) said in January that it would build as many as 905 planes this year.

Boeing is still making its jumbo jet, the 747. But production has slowed dramatically in recent years and only six of the aircraft were delivered in 2018.

End of a legend

Emirates had kept the A380 program on life support early last year by placing a big order for the aircraft. But this week, it followed other airlines like Qantas (QABSY) of Australia in canceling orders. Emirates is redirecting its money into buying 70 smaller passenger jets from Airbus, a mix of the manufacturer’s newest A330 and A350 models.

“While we are disappointed to have to give up our order, and sad that the program could not be sustained, we accept that this is the reality of the situation,” Emirates Chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said in a statement. “The A380 will remain a pillar of our fleet well into the 2030s.”

Airbus said it will begin discussions with employee representatives in the coming weeks over the 3,000 to 3,500 jobs that are likely to be affected by the end of A380 production. It added that the expanding A320 program and the big new order from Emirates “will offer a significant number of internal mobility opportunities.”"

N400AN, American’s first Airbus A321neo, touched down at Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT) shortly before noon Feb. 1. After clearing customs, the plane will head to American’s Base Maintenance facility at PIT, where it will spend a couple of weeks undergoing the usual extensive acceptance checks conducted whenever the airline adds a new aircraft type to its fleet. The Tech Ops – PIT team will install ViaSat satellite Wi-Fi, conduct general ops checks and add interior and exterior placards as they customize the aircraft for American. After that, it will visit other American bases before entering service.

The A321neo is scheduled to begin flying customers April 2 between Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX) in Arizona and Orlando International Airport (MCO) in Florida. Once the company takes more deliveries, additional routes will include PHX–Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (ANC) in Alaska over the summer, and PHX and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to Hawaii later this year as the A321neo begins to replace retiring Boeing 757s. The A321 is already a versatile aircraft, and the A321neo (which stands for “new engine option”) adds about 400 nautical miles in range thanks to improved fuel burn from the new engines, putting additional destinations within reach.

American has ordered 100 of these jets with deliveries running over the next several years. They seat 196 customers and, in addition to the fast Wi-Fi, include power at every seat and free wireless entertainment to each customer’s own device including free live television. Additionally, American is the launch customer for Airbus’ new XL overhead bins which significantly increase capacity. The A321neo is American’s first aircraft delivered with these bins and the company will begin retrofitting existing A321s with this same bin later this year.

American is taking the “Cabin Flex,” or “NX,” option of the A321neo, which has a new door configuration. The A321neo is part of the order for 460 aircraft placed by American in 2011, which also included 100 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. The aircraft from that order have transformed American’s fleet into the youngest among U.S. network airlines."

Modern day technology makes connectivity an everyday reality, with online access increasingly available as an in-flight option aboard airliners and at airports.

However, security and price remain important considerations, and figuring out the benefits and the pitfalls can be a challenge.

During the flight

Being connected in the air is becoming increasingly common, expanding from widebody jetliners to the single-aisle segment – especially with the increased time aloft for aircraft such the A321LR long-range variant of A321neo member of the Airbus A320 Family.

Airborne connectivity generally is a paid service, while limited access is provided free by some airlines – with this no-charge accessibility typically restricted to in-flight entertainment options or linking to a map showing the flight’s progress, as examples.

The price usually depends on the time spent online and the volume of data used, ranging anywhere from $7 to $30 (U.S.) per device. If passengers have several devices on board, using a free session on each can help keep the costs down, as connectivity is treated per device. Certain plans also can have data limits in addition to time limits, which can bring potential extra charges – even if the plan covers the flight’s entire duration.

In-flight network services typically have connection speeds of 15 Mbps – which is fast enough for streaming. Connectivity is constantly improving.

While connection speeds tend to be slower in-flight than on the ground, performance usually is sufficient for basic online browsing and text-based messages. It’s a good idea to check the airline’s Wi-Fi data plans before the trip: some offer discounted plans for members or frequent flyers, while others have a monthly pass for regular travellers. In some cases, there can be a significant mark-up to purchase access in the air, rather than before take-off.

Since in-flight network speed may be lacking, disabling background apps and automatic backup can help accelerate connectivity – as can downloading large files before boarding and visiting the desired websites before connecting to in-flight Wi-Fi so they cache locally. When travelling with several devices, passengers can share in-flight network access between them with a travel router, effectively turning a laptop into a Wi-Fi hotspot.

Airborne Wi-Fi may not be available during all phases of flight, based on factors that include altitude and the aircraft’s orientation.

As an alternative to in-flight Wi-Fi, some airlines offer a broadband connection, allowing passengers to use their own telephones to make calls, send messages or browse the internet rather than using the aircraft’s network. However, this also means that service providers may apply roaming changers as per the individual’s plan.

At the airport

To make passengers’ travel experience easier and more convenient, many airports offer free and simple access to the internet – although airport Wi-Fi connection speeds can vary.

When using public Wi-Fi, it’s important to keep in mind that certain networks may not be completely secure. There are steps passengers can take to keep their information safe, such as joining the official airport network – and not simply choosing the first one that appears on the list. This can be validated by seeing if the hotspot name matches the official connection name for the airport or its operating authority. Most airports will also require passengers to enter their email address and a password. Wi-Fi networks in business lounges may be more secure and faster, but the same rules of caution apply as well.

Airports in the United States, Southeast Asia, Germany and the Baltic countries get top rankings for Wi-Fi connection speeds, while airports in South America tend to have much slower connections.

To keep personal data safe, it is best to avoid sending any such information over a public Wi-Fi network while also ensuring the sites visited have secure HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) encryption. Passengers should avoid transferring documents via FTP (file transfer protocol) while also disabling automatic file sharing to the cloud while working on sensitive documents.

Using a personal or company VPN (virtual private network) also improves browsing safety, as it encrypts all communications. Having a VPN connection can also help access certain blocked websites, including social media and news sites, when travelling in a country with internet restrictions."

@AirbusDefence #Verde #data_farming #API

Toulouse, 04 February 2019 – Airbus launched an innovative service called Verde that delivers detailed crop analytics from satellite imagery, perfectly clipped to the field and accurately de-clouded. Served as plug and play API to any precision agriculture portal, Verde provides reliable and quantified measures of the vegetation, consistent over time and space, whatever the satellite used.



The new service primarily addresses in-season monitoring, to help anomalies detection, optimise field scouting, irrigation, seeding, fertilization, and crop protection. It is also of interest for off-season analysis, thanks to multi-year series of analytics, in order to review the farming strategy, define management zones based on persistent growth patterns and improve practices over the long run. Verde targets the entire chain of precision farming consulting providers, from the smallest start-ups to the largest machinists, seeds and fertilizers companies.

“With Verde, we underline our ambition to become the reference layer for precision agriculture portals. Both leveraging our wide imagery harvesting and our unrivalled crop analysis capacities, we are offering a totally different way to derive agronomic information from satellite imagery”, says François Lombard, Head of Intelligence Business at Airbus Defence and Space.

Verde has already been adopted by DataFarming, an Australian agtech company based in the regional city of Toowoomba, Queensland, delivering precision agriculture solutions for farmers and agronomists around the world.

“We are looking at expanding our product offering to our 7,500 farm user base who want more detail about the crop, beyond just NDVI. Having higher resolution on some of the data is also a key value proposition. This is where VERDE fits quite nicely. We have already processed 4,000,000 hectares of NDVI to date, and want to leverage our user base to offer this value added service. Crops such as cotton, rice, and sugarcane will certainly benefit” says Tim Neale, Managing Director of DataFarming.

Verde is a solution powered by OneAtlas, the digital platform of Airbus Defence and Space Intelligence.

OneAtlas is an industry-leading collaborative environment, designed with and for users to access premium imagery, perform large-scale image processing, extract industry-specific insights and develop the smartest geospatial solutions.

Airbus Won't Miss the A380 Jumbo Jet - The Motley Fool,"Sat, 16 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDE5LzAyLzE2L2FpcmJ1cy13b250LW1pc3MtdGhlLWEzODAtanVtYm8tamV0LmFzcHjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus will stop building its four-engine jumbo jet in 2021 -- and it's good news for shareholders.

On Thursday, Airbus (EADSY -1.16%) finally bowed to the inevitable and announced that it will end production of its A380 jumbo jet in 2021. The A380 production run will end with just over 250 having been built -- of which 234 have already been delivered -- a far cry from the 1,500-unit opportunity that Airbus initially envisioned.

The demise of the A380 means that Airbus will never recover its $20 billion-plus research and development costs. That said, it has been years since Airbus could reasonably expect to make a profit on the A380. Ending production sooner rather than later will allow the company to shift resources toward more promising projects, boosting future earnings and cash flow.

Check out the latest earnings call transcripts for companies we cover.

An airplane without a market

Airbus' rationale for developing a massive jumbo jet was that surging global air traffic would put strain on airlines' hubs, forcing them to use bigger aircraft like the A380.

This turned out to be a miscalculation. The development of more efficient small wide-bodies -- particularly Boeing's (BA -1.94%) 787 Dreamliner -- has allowed airlines to open up hundreds of new long-haul routes. More and more travelers can bypass the busiest hubs to get where they are going, obviating the need for airlines to shoulder the high operating costs of the Airbus A380.

Middle Eastern airline giant Emirates has been the exception that proved the rule. It operates the largest hub for international travel in the world and has used the A380 to deliver a high-end customer experience while rapidly adding capacity at its crowded Dubai hub. Only Emirates has the passenger volumes at a single hub to justify a substantial fleet of A380s. As of last month, it accounted for more than half of the A380s ever ordered and an even higher proportion of the remaining orders in the backlog.

However, Emirates is struggling to meet its financial targets and has no clear need for more A380s -- particularly because it plans to eventually move its hub to the more spacious Al Maktoum International Airport. The last straw was that the engines on its newest A380s haven't delivered the expected levels of fuel efficiency. As a result, even Emirates is finally ready to move on from the A380.

Emirates trades A380 orders for smaller wide-bodies

As of the end of January, Emirates had 53 outstanding firm orders for A380s. It will now reduce that order book by 39 aircraft. Between now and 2021, Emirates will take delivery of 14 more A380s. Japan's All Nippon Airways is also scheduled to receive three A380s this year. All of the remaining orders are likely to be canceled, paving the way for Airbus to discontinue A380 production in 2021.

The good news is that in conjunction with canceling its A380 orders, Emirates ordered 40 A330-900neos and 30 A350-900s from Airbus. That means a tentative agreement to buy 40 Boeing 787-10 Dreamliners struck in late 2017 is probably dead in the water.

Whereas Airbus has been struggling just to break even on the A380, the A330neo and A350 are quite profitable. However, the pace of A330neo sales has been quite slow. Emirates' order will significantly boost the backlog and may also give other airlines the confidence to commit to this model. That will allow Airbus to maintain or even increase its A330 family production in the coming years.

The A350 has a healthier backlog, but with Emirates' regional rival Etihad Airways recently deciding to cancel 42 orders, every new sale is important.

Positioned for profit growth

In its Q4 earnings report, Airbus reported a special charge of 463 million euros related to ending A380 production. However, Airbus' underlying results improved dramatically in 2018 relative to 2017, with adjusted operating profit nearly doubling to 5.8 billion euros. Falling production costs for the A350 family and rising A320neo production drove most of this increase.

The outlook for 2019 and beyond is even better. Airbus expects its adjusted operating profit to rise by about 15% this year. Meanwhile, adjusted free cash flow is on track to reach 4 billion euros, up from 2.9 billion euros in each of the last two years.

This will still leave Airbus dramatically less profitable than Boeing. (Boeing expects to produce about $15 billion of free cash flow this year.) However, it is finally on the right track. The A350 program's profitability should continue to improve over the next few years. The new Emirates order could eventually pave the way for a rebound in A330 family output. Finally, winding down A380 production will free up factory space for Airbus to build even more A320neos.

Airbus still needs to prove that it can stay disciplined on pricing and costs in order to grow its earnings further. But discontinuing the slow-selling A380 is definitely a good start."
A380: Airbus to stop making superjumbo as orders dry up - The Guardian,"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE5L2ZlYi8xNC9hMzgwLWFpcmJ1cy10by1lbmQtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1vZi1zdXBlcmp1bWJv0gFcaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMTkvZmViLzE0L2EzODAtYWlyYnVzLXRvLWVuZC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLW9mLXN1cGVyanVtYm8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has announced it will end production of its A380 superjumbo passenger jet after failing to secure orders – a move that puts UK jobs at risk.

The European aerospace group said it had made the “painful” decision to stop making the world’s largest superjumbo in 2021 after Emirates, the A380’s biggest customer, reduced an outstanding order for 53 planes to only 14.

Emirates will instead order 70 of the smaller A330 and A350 aircraft, underlining the trend towards smaller, more efficient aircraft that made the A380 unsustainable.

The cancellation of the A380 will affect the jobs of as many as 3,500 Airbus staff, including about 300 at its factory in Broughton, north Wales, which constructs the model’s wings.

The Broughton site has about 6,000 employees, while there are another 3,000 in Filton, near Bristol; some of whom work on landing gear and fuel systems for the A380. However, Airbus said a “significant number” of staff will move to production of other, more popular models and major job losses in the UK are not expected as a result of the announcement.

Rhys McCarthy, the national officer for aerospace at Unite, said the union is seeking assurances from Airbus that there will be no job losses. He added that companies in the A380 supply chain, including Redditch-based GKN, are a “key concern”.

Tom Enders, Airbus’s outgoing chief executive, said the cancellation was “painful for us”. He said: “We have no substantial A380 backlog and hence no basis to sustain production, despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years.”

Speaking at Airbus’s headquarters in Toulouse, France, Enders said the effect on jobs in the UK “needs to be evaluated”. He said: “Hopefully we can reuse and redeploy a significant number of employees there.

“What we’re seeing here is the end of the large, four-engine aircraft,” said Enders, who admitted that the company was a decade late in developing the superjumbo. Boeing, Airbus’s American arch-rival, this month celebrated 50 years of production of its 747.

Engines for the A380 are produced in Derby by Rolls-Royce, another major British aerospace employer, although it is thought that the effect on UK jobs numbers will be small.

In a statement, Chris Cholerton, Rolls-Royce’s civil aerospace president, said: “The A380 is a world-class feat of engineering, much loved by passengers, and we are obviously saddened that deliveries will come to an end.”

Airbus said that more than 190 million passengers have flown in the A380 since the first plane rolled off the assembly line in Toulouse, France, in 2007. However, the plane, which can theoretically carry as many as 800 passengers, has struggled for profitability as demand for mid-sized jets boomed.

Airbus, which on Thursday also announced stronger than expected profits for 2018, is planning to ramp up production of its smaller models even as the A380 winds down. It is targeting between 880 and 890 deliveries of aircraft to its customers during 2019, a 10% increase from its record haul of 800 in 2018.

However, the A380 cancellation will add another element of uncertainty for the future of UK operations already threatened by the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. Enders last month decried “Brexiteers’ madness”, saying that future investment decisions would be influenced if Brexit led to significant trade frictions.

Enders on Thursday said he believed the “voices of reason” would prevail, avoiding a no-deal Brexit. In June last year Airbus said there would be a cost of €1bn (about £880m) for every week of delay in production. The company and its suppliers have built up buffer stocks of about €1bn, in line with estimates made in June.

Enders said: “Looking at the situation as it is I’m still optimistic that a solution can be found that avoids a fall from a cliff.”

The end of the A380 may free up space at Airbus’s Toulouse and Hamburg facilities, where final assembly is currently carried out, giving them a boost in the competition for business with the UK. However, Enders denied reports that Spain had made a formal offer to take wing production from the UK after Brexit.

The end of the A380 comes at a crucial time for Airbus as it takes on a new leadership team after losing out to Boeing in the aircraft deliveries race in 2018. Guillaume Faury, a former helicopter engineer who became the president of Airbus’s commercial aircraft business in February 2018, will take over from Enders as chief executive in April.

Faury said the risks from Brexit were “enormous” in both the short and long term, with the principal risk to Airbus coming in delays at the UK’s border with the rest of the EU."

Australian flag carrier Qantas on Thursday confirmed it would not take up eight Airbus A380s already ordered—the latest blow for the European airspace firm.

In a statement, Sydney-based Qantas said it would focus instead on refurbishing its existing 12 Airbus super-jumbo planes.

""Following discussions with Airbus, Qantas has now formalised its decision not to take eight additional A380s that were ordered in 2006,"" a Qantas spokesperson said.

""These aircraft have not been part of the airline's fleet and network plans for some time.""

The decision, which was expected, is another hit for the troubled A380 programme.

Airbus recently confirmed that it was in talks with Emirates to change an order of 36 A380 planes to smaller A350s.

Launched a decade ago the double-decker plane was hailed as a revolution for the industry and a challenge to Boeing's stranglehold on the super-large-aircraft market.

But the superjumbo has struggled to win orders, leading it to ramp down production.

Analysts point to customers demanding flights directly to their destination rather than following Airbus's model of taking a long haul journey from hub-to-hub followed by a short hop on a smaller plane.

Qantas is expected to take delivery of six of Boeing's rival Dreamliners sometime this year, and will continue to run A380s already in the fleet.

""Qantas remains committed to a major upgrade of its existing A380s, which begins in mid-calendar 2019 and will see us operate the aircraft well into the future,"" the spokesperson said.

Farewell to the A380: Why It Became a Drag for Airbus - Knowledge@Wharton,"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8va25vd2xlZGdlLndoYXJ0b24udXBlbm4uZWR1L3BvZGNhc3Qva25vd2xlZGdlLWF0LXdoYXJ0b24tcG9kY2FzdC9ob3ctY2hhbmdpbmctdHJhdmVsLXRyZW5kcy1raWxsZWQtdGhlLWEzODAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"More than 50 years ago, the Beatles told us that ‘All You Need Is Love.’ But Roger W. Clark, visiting professor at Rutgers University Law School where he teaches aviation law, said that statement didn’t quite live up to its promise in the case of the A380 aircraft, the largest commercial jetliner, which manufacturer Airbus said earlier this month that it plans to stop producing beginning in 2021.

“If all you needed was love, the A380 would be flying forever because it probably has the most comfortable ride,” said Clark, who has practiced aviation law for more than three decades and is also founding member and managing partner of the Clark Law Group, which has offices in California and Florida. “It’s silent. It has a very stable platform. You have an incredible amount of room, and bars and showers in first class. It’s a passenger paradise.”

As it turned out, the A380 needed some business logic as well to survive. Kenneth Button, public policy professor at George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government and an expert on transportation policy, recalled a meeting he once had with the president of Air France, which was buying an A380 at the time. “I asked the [Air France] president why he was buying one. He simply used one word: politics.”

The A380 was supposed to revolutionize commercial air travel, and was launched in 1990 as a response to Boeing’s 747. The first deliveries of the A380 began in 2007 to Singapore Airlines, and the aircraft had its prime years between 2012 and 2014. Airbus announced the end of the A380 in a press release about Emirates reducing its A380 order book from 162 to 123 aircraft. Earlier this month, Australian airline Qantas, too, canceled its order for eight A380 aircraft.

Clark and Button examined the causes behind the discontinuation of the A380 on the Knowledge at Wharton radio show on SiriusXM. (Listen to the podcast at the top of this page.)

Misreading the Market

For starters, Airbus had overestimated sales of the wide-bodied, 544-seat jet. Also, the A380 is designed for passenger transport and cannot accommodate cargo, although cargo transportation was a fast-growing market, they said. The A380 also fell victim to Open Skies agreements, where airlines could respond to market demands and not be subject to political arrangements between countries on how many landings and takeoffs they would permit. Alongside, Airbus also did not anticipate the rapid growth of intermediary or secondary cities, and the ability of smaller jets to directly service them, bypassing the megacity hubs, according to a Reuters report.

Perhaps the biggest mistake Airbus made was wrongly forecasting demand for the A380. Clark noted that while Airbus expected to have about 1,500 A380s in service by 2020, it has thus far delivered fewer than 300 of them. As of January 2019, Airbus had 313 firm orders for the aircraft.

Missing the cargo market with the A380 was another failure of Airbus. “It’s not a cargo plane and it’s very difficult to convert,” said Button, adding that its main competitor, the Boeing 747, continues production of the cargo version. “[Airbus] misjudged the type of traffic that is growing.”

Although Airbus has invested an estimated $25 billion over the years to develop the A380, it targeted a relatively limited market niche. “You can’t use it for smaller routes,” said Button. “The planes which are successful and where you make your money [are those] that you can continually evolve, change, modify and stretch, like the Boeing 737. When you go for a specialized plane like the Concorde or the A380, you are really risking an awful lot on basically one type of market.”

“If all you needed was love, the A380 would be flying forever because it probably has the most comfortable ride.” –Roger Clark

The Open Skies Factor

The A380 was designed to serve large hubs in megacities, “but the markets are different now,” said Button. “There are a lot of gateways into America, and ditto when you fly to Europe or the Middle East, or from the Middle East to Asia. It’s not all going to the major hubs anymore. The world has changed quite considerably and that’s what Boeing was actually banking on and that’s what their forecasts told them would happen. Airbus didn’t get the forecast right.”

While Airbus was banking on the hub-and-spoke model for the A380, the aircraft made its market touchdown at a time “when Open Skies began to kick off,” said Clark. Under Open Skies agreements, countries agree to open up their airspace to market dynamics as opposed to trying to control the entry, routing, landings and takeoffs based on political allocations, he explained. Europe, the U.S. and many other countries are now in the Open Skies environment, he pointed out. “That was a political [development] that I think Boeing was anticipating. Airbus, I think, anticipated the wrong way, and that was one of the nails that went into the coffin of the A380.”

The industry is under a lot of pressure to get away from the hub-and-spoke model “because of the continued increase in passenger traffic of more than 5% per year,” Clark added. “JFK, Philadelphia and Logan [in Boston] can only take so many landings per day per day, so you need to find other locations that are more convenient to passengers and have point-to-point service.”

Advantage Boeing

Airbus’s debacles have often benefited Boeing, its biggest competitor. That would be the case this time around as well, and Boeing’s new aircraft line, the 777-9, which can carry 414 passengers, is in line to fill the market that the A380 would vacate, according to Clark. “Airlines that may have been going for the A380 will probably now be looking at the 777- 9 because it is specifically designed to be more fuel-efficient,” he said.

Fuel efficiency is critical to the bottom lines of airlines, according to Button. He noted that airlines gain 1% more fuel efficiency every year when they buy new aircraft, although some aircraft allow the requisite technology to be fitted in retroactively. “Airlines want fuel economy and reliability, but they also want in particular aircraft which fit into their network systems,” he said. “Boeing markets many of its airplanes specifically on that particular feature [of fuel efficiency].” It doesn’t help the A380 that it requires “quite a lot of downtime because of the nature of the network it serves,” he added.

“When you go for a specialized plane like the Concorde or the A380, you are really risking an awful lot on basically one type of market.” –Kenneth Button

Next Strategies at Boeing and Airbus

Aircraft design and manufacturing entails long-term strategies and planning, and orders for planes arrive up to 15 years in advance, Button noted. “It releases resources for speeding up production of existing models,” he said. “There are always some bottlenecks in these production lines for different planes; [the A380 phase-out] may allow development and refinements of existing planes to take place more rapidly. One assumes that this decision was made within a larger strategic plan. So, Boeing has got to somehow second-guess what Airbus will do and adjust its strategy accordingly.” As it happens, Airbus’s stock price actually rose after the announcement of the decision to phase out the A380, Clark pointed out.

Meanwhile, optimism rules the broader aircraft market. “Both Boeing and Airbus are bullish on the future of the commercial market,” said Clark. He noted that while the current worldwide fleet of commercial aircraft is an estimated 20,000, Airbus and Boeing are forecasting that market to go up to 40,000 over the next several decades. About 70% of those are expected to be narrow-bodied aircraft, and not the wide-bodied version, he added.

Clark pointed in particular to increasing aircraft demand from China and India, which typically serve regional markets. In response to the growing demand from regional markets, Airbus and Boeing have partnered with relatively smaller players to produce aircraft variants. Boeing has a partnership with Embraer of Brazil, while Airbus has a partnership with Bombardier of Canada.

As with all closures, layoffs are on the horizon at Airbus. Airbus has said it will begin discussions with its partners in the next few weeks on how to deal with the 3,000 to 3,500 positions that will be potentially impacted over the next three years by its A380 decision. It noted that “the ongoing A320 ramp-up and the new wide-body order from Emirates Airline will offer a significant number of internal mobility opportunities.”"
Is Boeing or Airbus Better? We Asked an Airline Pilot - The Points Guy,"Tue, 12 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2lzLWJvZWluZy1vci1haXJidXMtYmV0dGVyLXdlLWFza2VkLWFuLWFpcmxpbmUtcGlsb3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The corporate rivalry between Boeing and Airbus is the one of the most heated on the planet. The American planemaker and its European rival share the market for large airliners almost 50/50, based on deliveries in 2018, and fight tooth and nail to beat one another. Last year, Boeing delivered 806 jets to customers while Airbus set a new company record with 800 deliveries.

While many flyers may not be able to tell the two apart at the gate, pilots know there's a big difference. And there are two very different philosophies behind how they fly those two brands of airplanes.

That's not to suggest that one approach is better than the other.

Let's take as an example the companies' top products, the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320, respectively the number one and two biggest-selling jetliners ever. They have safely flown countless millions of hours, and both programs have been hugely successful.

Launched in 1984, the A320 was a clean-sheet design that incorporated digital fly-by-wire control systems. It was revolutionary at the time, with side-sticks replacing traditional yokes and extensive use of glass displays instead of mechanical dials and gauges on the flight deck. With the A320, Airbus transformed how pilots interact and fly the airplane. Fly-by-wire meant that pilots sent their inputs to a computer that would then move the control surfaces.

Airbus has continuously updated the aircraft, and its latest iteration is the A320neo, or ""New Engine Option,"" with more fuel-efficient and quieter Pratt & Whitney or CFM International turbofans. More than 8,600 A320-family aircraft, including the smaller A318 and A319 and larger A321, have been delivered.

The twin-engine Boeing 737 goes back over 50 years, with a first flight in 1967. It was a descendant of two early Boeing planes, the four-engine 707 and the 727 tri-jet. The 737's cabin and flight deck width are still the same size as the original 707 that first went into service in the 1950s.

Boeing, too, has continuously updated the 737. It's had four different types of engines and three different wings during its life. Pilots got four generations of cockpits, all which maintained some attributes of the original 1967 airplane.

Over 10,000 737s have been delivered to airlines. The aircraft has been stretched and upgraded over the years, the latest being the 737 MAX series with the latest CFM International turbofans and distinctive winglets. They are so different that the first 737, the 100 model, was 94 ft long and had a maximum takeoff weight of 110,000 lbs — but the latest, the MAX 10, stretches to 144 ft and can weigh up to 194,000 lbs.

But what does a professional, highly experienced pilot think of the planes?

""I love both aircraft for different reasons. Where one comes up short, the other one excels,"" said Captain Rory Kay, in an interview with TPG.

He should know. He's flown them all. Early in his airline career, Kay flew the Boeing 727 and the 737s that entered service in the late 1980s, now known as 737 Classic. He went on to be First Officer on the larger Boeing 757 and the twin-aisle 767, before making captain on the Airbus A320, which he flew for years. With over 24,000 hours in the air, Kay is a training and check pilot on the 757 and 767 and will soon move to captaining the Boeing 777, the biggest passenger plane flying for any US airline. He's also former Air Safety Chairman for the Air Line Pilots Association.

Physical differences aside — and we'll get to those — the fundamental distinction between the two types is in the flight control system and how pilots fly the plane. On the 737, the pilot's yoke and pedals are hydraulically boosted and mechanically connected to the plane's aerodynamic control surfaces: ailerons, elevator and rudder. In a fly-by-wire (FBW) aircraft like the A320, the movements of the side-stick are interpreted by the computers driving the control surfaces. Although there might be a mechanically-connected backup for some controls, the FBW system's algorithms are designed to simplify aviating and limit extreme maneuvers.

""I can't just put the stick full over on an Airbus and roll it upside down. As long as it's in Normal Law, it will not let you exceed certain roll and pitch limits,"" Kay said. (Normal Law describes the active protections that operate on a regular flight ""where everything is functioning as designed,"" he added.)

That can be critical when pilots are faced with an emergency escape maneuver, perhaps due to traffic, wind shear or terrain. The system is designed to limit how high the nose can be safely raised, easing the pilot's workload.

""I can absolutely pull that side-stick hard back, that's all I have to do. It's going to give me the best possible climb out, the best escape performance, and the plane isn't going to stall. That's one very nice thing about the Airbus FBW system.""

Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger partially attributed his safe landing at the controls of US Airways 1549 to the computer protections that aided the aircraft's engineless glide into the Hudson River.

But there is a major limitation to the Airbus side-sticks, according to Kay.

The side-sticks aren't linked, so whichever pilot isn't flying can't see or feel what the pilot who is flying is doing with the controls. That's a major difference from a Boeing's synchronized yokes, which are linked mechanically. And they're sitting right in front of each pilot¸ giving both visual and tactile feedback on what the other pilot is doing.

""On the Airbus, you don't know what the other pilot is doing in terms of control inputs whereas on a Boeing, I've got instant feedback on how hard my copilot is working, or how little he's working on the situation. That's always troubled me on an Airbus. I've looked over and my copilot is just mangling the side-stick — left, right, forward, back — like it's a video game or something, and I've said 'Whoa, slow down and take it easy!'""

In 2009, when sensor icing on an Air France Airbus A330 degraded the plane's built-in protections, investigators concluded that confusion over the pilots' side-stick inputs contributed to the crash of the plane in the South Atlantic. This tragic accident renewed discussions about the lack of feedback or interconnect between the two sides of the cockpit in aircraft equipped with this system.

Addressing this, BAE Systems developed electronically-coupled ""active"" side-sticks, with the first installations now certified in the new Gulfstream G500 corporate jet and on military aircraft like the Embraer KC-390 airlifter. Russia's MC-21, now in testing, will be the first large commercial passenger jet to use the new technology, supplied by Collins Aerospace.

The Airbus and Boeing philosophies on engine throttle systems diverge, too. On an Airbus, pilots adjust the throttles incrementally to taxi and set the levers that sit between the two pilots to command a computer-assigned level of take-off thrust. But once the throttles are moved to the ""cruise"" position after takeoff, the levers don't budge, even though the computer may be commanding a change in engine thrust.

At the end of the flight, when the plane is in the flare just feet above the runway — that's when the nose is pulled up so the main landing gear touches down first — the system calls out ""retard, retard, retard,"" telling the pilots to move the throttles to idle. Airbus calls this an auto-thrust system, whereas Boeing designs its jets with an autothrottle.

With Boeing's autothrottle system, the thrust levers are ""back-driven,"" constantly adjusted by motors changing the levers' position based on the system's commands.

""With the Boeing, I see the throttles moving and it gives me that feedback. It improves my situational awareness to no end because I know what the airplane is trying to do to the engines,"" Kay said.

On the down side, the legacy of the 737's original 1950s-era flight deck dimensions doesn't make it a particularly comfortable place to spend a long flight, according to Kay.

""The Airbus has a very quiet and comfortable cockpit, much better than a 737. There's much less 'white noise' in the Airbus, so it's less fatiguing, and the seats are much more comfortable. And the windows are huge — I really like that.""

""There's a lot that Airbus does right. If the airline came to me and said, 'You can only fly either the 737 or the Airbus for the rest of your career,' I'd go with the Airbus."" That said, ""if I had to have my perfect narrow-body plane, it would be a combination of the two. It would be mostly Airbus design, but with a traditional control wheel and back-driven autothrottles.""

Embraer did just that when it developed its own fly-by-wire philosophy for its business jets and newest commercial airliners. The Brazilian company studied the lessons of both Boeing and Airbus cockpits, taking the best attributes of both. And the Airbus A220, originally the Bombardier C Series, has side-sticks, but along with back-driven thrust levers.

As Airbus developed its newest aircraft, including the A330, A350 and A380, it maintained a consistent flight-deck philosophy that allows pilots to transition between aircraft easily.

Pilots flying Airbus planes can be trained in so-called ""mixed-fleet flying,"" where they can fly a long-haul A330 in the morning, and shift to a single-aisle A321 in the afternoon.

And while the 737 may have its roots in its 1950s-era ancestors, as Boeing has introduced new airplanes over the decades, like its fly-by-wire 777 and 787, it has introduced more computers and electronic aids to the smaller 737 as well.

But the original feud remains. It's still side-stick versus yoke, and Airbus versus Boeing."
Are A380s now heading for the scrapheap? - CNN,"Sat, 16 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtc2NyYXBoZWFwLXNjbGktaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

A whopping great beast of an aircraft, the double-decker Airbus A380 – the biggest passenger airplane the world has ever known – is an incredible sight whether on land or in the air.

Such gravity-defying proportions combined with the genuinely enjoyable experience of flying in one have won it legions of admirers since its first commercial voyage in 2007.

So it was no surprise that there was widespread consternation at the February 14 announcement that Airbus intends to cease production of the A380 in 2019, effectively placing an expiry date on an aircraft that was once seen as the future of aviation.

But how quickly are A380s going to vanish from our skies? Is widespread affection for the huge aircraft enough to keep it flying well into its dotage, in the way many classic planes continue flying well beyond their service life?

Commercially, the superjumbo’s days are clearly numbered. Airbus’s announcement follows the cancellation of several orders by key airlines despite a decade of efforts by the aircraft’s manufacturer to persuade them the aircraft was part of a new revolution in air travel.

That said, with Airbus continuing to offer mechanical support, the A380 potentially has many more years of flying ahead of it. Such modern machines typically have a lifespan of at least two decades, meaning we could still be boarding them in the 2040s, maybe even later.

But some experts believe it could be heading off to the bone yard far sooner. In death, as well as life the A380 seems doomed to an ignominious fate.

You wouldn’t think that from the initial reaction to news of its demise.

“A very sad day for an amazing aircraft which pilots & passengers love,” wrote British Airways pilot Dave Wallsworth, who regularly blogs about his experiences helming the airplane.

“It is absolutely sad,” says CNN anchor and aviation expert Richard Quest. “I covered this from the days when it was still a project known as the A3XX and even before that, right through to its maiden flight and entry into service.

The reason for such affection is partly down to size. The flying leviathan’s hulking presence would, in its early days, draw crowds of spectators to airfields. Pilots of other airplanes would deliberately slow down while taxiing to give their passengers a better drive-by gawp.

At 79.75 meters, the A380’s wingspan is only beaten by the Antonov An-225 Mriya, the world’s largest aircraft by weight, length and wingspan. It can hold up to 853 passengers in a single-class economy configuration, although most of its operators opt for a more spacious 450 to 500 passenger layout.

“From a purely technological point, everyone agreed this was an amazing plane,” says CNN’s Quest. “When they designed it, they could require changes to jetways and to terminals, they could require changes to taxiways to allow two planes to pass each other, but they couldn’t require larger runways.

“Instead, they had to build a plane that could take off on length of about 10,000 feet or 3,000 meters. So they did it by use of the wings and the engines, an incredible achievement.”

And then there’s the experience of actually flying in an A380.

“It is an exceptionally quiet plane,” says Quest. “I flew recently sitting on the upper deck, behind the wings and those huge engines, and you could hold a normal conversation. There was virtually no noise.

The promise of greater luxury in the sky was one of the great selling points of the A380 for fliers more used to the cramped conditions of smaller aircraft or tight seating configurations even in bigger machines like the Boeing 747.

Ironically, the 747 – the original jumbo – first flew 50 years ago this month, February 1969. For decades it helped make international air travel available to more people than perhaps any other airliner.

Nonetheless it’s still in production, as Boeing cranks out the 747-8 model in modest numbers while major airlines have been phasing 747s out of service. It’s remarkable that the 747’s production life will outlive the A380s – perhaps adding more truth to the argument that making a superjumbo was an old-fashioned idea to begin with.

Flying in the lap of luxury

When the A380 launched in 2007, there was talk of marketing it to high rollers by installing onboard casinos and double bed suites, such was the amount of available space. While Virgin founder Richard Branson later backtracked on the casino idea, double beds have been installed on many planes.

Some carriers used it to set the gold standard for their first class offerings, with Singapore Airlines, the A380’s launch partner, pioneering its award-winning hotel-suite style accommodation on its superjumbos.

Gulf carrier Etihad is among airlines offering an onboard shower to first class A380, passengers, as well as an exclusive premium concept known as “The Residence” an entire apartment located in the corner of the upper deck, replete with a living room, double bedroom, ensuite shower and its own dedicated butler.

“To build such an extravagance into a commercial passenger jet just shows how much space airlines have to play with on these aircraft,” says CNN Travel’s global editor Barry Neild, who toured a “Residence” during a 2017 flight from London to Abu Dhabi.

But who flies in such opulence? According to airline staff it’s a combination of the super rich and aviation fanatics seeking the best experiences they can find in the sky, sometimes cashing in stockpiles of air miles to ride in style.

Naked at 40,000 feet

Inevitably for a UAE-based carrier, a lot of the custom comes from the country’s wealthy royalty.

“The butler on the aircraft I flew in told me that some sheiks prefer The Residence to their own private jets,” Neild adds. “Sometimes they’ll have their private jet follow on behind, so they can enjoy the comfort of long haul on the A380, and the convenience of their own plane for short hops at their destination.”

And is it worth it?

“I was given permission to take a shower in the residence during the journey,” says Neild. “Apart from the dubious bragging rights to being naked on a plane at 40,000 feet, it was a whole new level of airplane comfort that instantly blitzes the weariness of red-eye flight.

“It’s somewhat depressing to go back to economy class on a normal airplane after trying something like that.”

A victim of fashion

Airports too, bought into the A380 vision as experts conjured up a future in which air travel congestion would be eased by large airplanes ferrying passengers between major hubs like London, Dubai or Atlanta, where they’d then connect to short-haul flights on smaller jets.

Gates, sometimes entire terminals were reconfigured to accommodate the bigger planes.

However, despite huge rises in the number of people traveling by air – and the continued rise of airport superhubs – things haven’t quite turned out the way many imagined.

As with Concorde before it, the A380’s problem is one of economics. Had airlines been able to fill every flight to capacity, it would’ve been a success story – carrying more people at lower per-passenger cost.

“It’s always easy to be wise in retrospect, but Airbus’s gamble on the A380 went horribly wrong,” says Murdo Morrison, head of strategic content at aviation intelligence specialist FlightGlobal.

“The strategy of most airlines demanded smaller, more efficient widebodies that they could operate point-to-point on more frequent schedules,”

Instead, airlines shifted their interest to lighter, more fuel-efficient passenger jets, meaning that as of 2019, Airbus has sold less than a quarter of the 1,200 A380s it predicted it would sell.

Airbus’ A350 and Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner have already proved this. And the upcoming Boeing 777-9 will seat more than 400 passengers – thanks to the addition of huge, lightweight carbon fiber wings, hastening the A380s demise.

‘Too bloody big’

“Airbus has spent the last decade and a half trying to convince skeptical airlines and the media that the A380’s moment is nigh,” said Morrison. “In the end, simple economics won out.”

So how long with the A380 keep flying? Despite the decades of service life left in newer models, that future could again be determined by economics. Already the first superjumbos have reportedly been decommissioned and earmarked for salvage.

FlightGlobal’s Morrison says that with little demand in the secondhand market the lifespan of the giant plane will be shorter than smaller models.

“The early customers of the aircraft, Emirates included, have already made plans to retire their oldest A380s,” he said. “Many more will be heading for the scrapheap throughout the 2020s.”

But will the A380 follow the trajectory enjoyed by supersonic jet Concorde, enjoying an afterlife through the veneration of its supporters?

Already one A380 has been installed in the Le Bourget Aerospace Museum near Paris, but CNN’s Quest says other airplanes are unlikely to follow.

“Concorde conjured up an aspiration, it was something that only a few could fly on but everyone wanted to fly on,” he says. “And it did something that no other aircraft did. This cannot be said of the 380.

“Instead we’ll probably end up with a giant scrapheap of 380s, unless Airbus comes up with a deal to buy them back.

“It’s certainly too bloody big for a museum.”"

However, the work doesn’t end with issuance of a jetliner’s airworthiness certificate. Before it can be operated in countries other than the EASA member states, a nation’s own aviation authority must validate the EASA certification.

Three Airbus team members who are heavily involved with airworthiness validation – Didier Robin, Head of Airworthiness & Certification; Layla Gowland, office of the Chief Airworthiness Engineer – A320 Family; and Samuel Mericq, office of the Chief Airworthiness Engineer – A350 XWB – field questions on what it involves.

What’s the difference between certification and validation?

Robin: Type certification shows that the aircraft meets all of the regulations required by EASA. Airbus also endeavours, where possible, to obtain a concurrent Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) type validation. The EASA type certification or FAA validation is sufficient for some airworthiness authorities, most European countries and the U.S., and no further validation activity is needed.

For other countries, the national airworthiness authority needs to “validate” the type certification, to see that the aircraft meets all of their rules. Thanks to International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), all we need is this validation; we don’t need to recertify the aircraft in each country.

What is it that national authorities look for?

Gowland: It depends on the authorities’ domestic concerns and experience. Countries like Canada or Russia may want detailed information on cold weather performance while Middle Eastern countries might want more information on hot weather performance.

Others may have points of interest such as physical security, cyber security or runway capabilities. Then again, they may ask for information on new technology such as a composite material fuselage or a new function like ROPS (runway overrun protection system) or AED (auto-emergency descent).

Is the level of review the same from country to country?

Mericq: No, this varies from authority to authority and may also be influenced by the authority’s working arrangement (if any) with EASA. For some authorities, the EASA type certificate is sufficient. For some countries, with perhaps some aviation industry, the authorities may request more details and wish to have meetings with us to gain more information.

Then there are several countries – including Russia, Brazil, China and Canada – with well-developed aviation manufacturing industries and their own aviation regulatory references. Often, they may want to deep dive on different topics.

What is a typical validation process?

Robin: When we know that a new aircraft type is going to be delivered to a country, we submit an application to the national authority for the validation of the EASA type certificate. For new developments, this happens up to two years before delivery. Working with EASA, we start by giving the national authority general knowledge and then we get more technical. The authority may come to Toulouse for familiarisation sessions to discuss and define the validation items, things like new technologies or points of interest.

How does Airbus show that the aircraft complies with their regulations?

Mericq: We have our technical and certification dossiers from which we present the scope of the validation request. There can be some negotiation regarding what we share due to proprietary information we want to protect. We have worked hard over the years to build trust with the airworthiness authorities, spread knowledge and strengthen safety requirements. After all, we all have the same goal: promoting and serving safety.

Has the process changed over the years?

Gowland: Obviously, we sell more aircraft – for example, over 90 countries now have airlines that operate members of the A320 Family – and to support validation activities, we have people at our facilities in Europe, China and the U.S. And then there are the aircraft variants and new safety functions we develop that need to be certified and validated. It’s challenging but productive."

Aircraft manufacturer Airbus has announced plans to stop the production of the world’s largest commercial passenger plane, the A380 superjumbo, by 2021.

The European aviation giant said on Thursday it would cease production of the airliner after 12 years in service due to weak sales.

With two decks of spacious cabins and room for 544 people in the standard layout, the superjumbo was designed to challenge Boeing’s legendary 747, but it failed to take hold as airlines backed a new generation of smaller, nimbler jets.

The company said in a statement that Emirates – a UAE-based airline, which had the A380 as the backbone of its fleet – is cutting back its orders for the plane as a result.

“Emirates has been a staunch supporter of the superjumbo since its very inception,” Emirates Chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum told Reuters.

“While we are disappointed to have to give up our order, and sad that the programme could not be sustained, we accept that this is the reality of the situation,” he added.

Airbus will produce 17 more of the planes including 14 for Emirates and 3 for Japanese airline ANA.

Despite the Emirates reducing its orders for the iconic superjumbo, it struck a deal worth $21.4bn placing a new order for 70 of the smaller A350 and A330 neo models partially restoring a purchase of A350 aircraft which it cancelled in 2014.

The European company said it would enter into talks with unions in coming weeks over the 3,000-3,500 jobs potentially affected.

Discussions ongoing with unions

Al Jazeera’s Natacha Butler, reporting from the Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, said that while workers might find the news alarming, shareholders will be relieved that the long-haul aircraft’s days are coming to an end.

“In terms of the workers, they will be extremely worried about what this means for them and their future.”

“Discussions are ongoing with unions to try and see as to what will happen to the staff and the workers that are affected by this decision in the coming months.”

Airbus’s decision is good news for rival Boeing. Airbus had hoped the A380 would squeeze out Boeing’s 747 and revolutionise air travel as more people take to the skies.

170112112757271

But sales of the industry’s largest four-engined jets have fallen due to the improvements in lighter twin-engined alternatives, such as the Boeing 787 and 777 or Airbus’s own A350.

Airlines have also been cautious about committing to the costly plane, so huge that airports had to build new runways and modify terminals to accommodate it.

The twin-deck planes started flying in 2008 and seat more than 500 passengers.

The decision to scrap production is the last major step by outgoing Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders."

Emirates will take delivery of 14 further A380s over the next two years. As a consequence and given the lack of order backlog with other airlines, Airbus will cease deliveries of the A380 in 2021.

Emirates has also decided to continue growing with Airbus’ newest generation, flexible widebody aircraft, ordering 40 A330-900 and 30 A350-900 aircraft.

“As a result of this decision we have no substantial A380 backlog and hence no basis to sustain production, despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years. This leads to the end of A380 deliveries in 2021,” said Airbus Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders. “The consequences of this decision are largely embedded in our 2018 full year results”.

“The A380 is not only an outstanding engineering and industrial achievement. Passengers all over the world love to fly on this great aircraft. Hence today’s announcement is painful for us and the A380 communities worldwide. But, keep in mind that A380s will still roam the skies for many years to come and Airbus will of course continue to fully support the A380 operators,” Tom Enders added.

“The A380 is Emirates’ flagship and has contributed to the airline’s success for more than ten years. As much as we regret the airline’s position, selecting the A330neo and A350 for its future growth is a great endorsement of our very competitive widebody aircraft family,” said Guillaume Faury, President of Airbus Commercial Aircraft and future Airbus CEO. “Going forward, we are fully committed to deliver on the longstanding confidence Emirates is placing in Airbus.”

Airbus will start discussions with its social partners in the next few weeks regarding the 3,000 to 3,500 positions potentially impacted over the next three years. However, the ongoing A320 ramp-up and the new widebody order from Emirates Airline will offer a significant number of internal mobility opportunities."

Perhaps none more than the residents of Lévignac, who rush to their windows and line the sidewalks when six articulated trucks, carrying the wings, fuselage, and other bits of the aircraft squeeze through the quaint French town on their way to Airbus’ assembly plant in nearby Toulouse.

For most of its planes, Airbus moves such parts, which come from its plants in France, Germany, Spain, and the UK, by transport plane. The elements of the A380, though, are too big even for the whale-inspired Beluga. Instead, they move by sea and by river, a journey that Airbus calls the Oversize Transport Itinerary. And the streets of Lévignac are so narrow that getting those trucks through the town required a feasibility study by Airbus and the French government. It even produced a study called “Trailer truck trajectory optimization: the transportation of components for the Airbus A380.” That’s just to build the thing—actually flying it required rejiggering airport infrastructure. Getting people onto and off the plane requires dual boarding bridges (going to different levels). Some airports would have to widen taxiways; most would have to move signage around.

Everything about the plane is huge: It's 238.5 feet long and 262 feet from wingtip to wingtip. It’s seven stories tall. It contains 4 million parts and 220 cabin windows. airbus

All of which is to say, the A380 has always been a complicated machine, a feat of engineering, aeronautical as well as logistical. That’s because everything about the plane is huge. The double decker is 238.5 feet long and 262 feet from wingtip to wingtip. It’s seven stories tall. If you overlaid the A320 on the A380, the smaller plane’s tail just reaches to the jumbo’s wings. It contains 4 million parts and 220 cabin windows. In its standard 3-class configuration, it seats 517 people. You can fit 11 people in a single row. It is, as we said nearly a decade ago, awesome.

Awesome, however, does not mean successful. The plane’s sales figures were as dismal as its specs are impressive. In 2015, Airbus took orders for just two A380s. In 2016, it took none. In 2017, it took none."

The report can be read in full, here.

The study’s headlines are fairly positive. The researchers put questions to respondents in four locations around the world: Los Angeles, Mexico City, Switzerland, New Zealand. All have issues with road traffic congestion, liberal approaches to technological innovation or a combination of the two.

The aim of the study was to explore the perception around UAM and find out about the public’s major concerns and attitudes towards futuristic methods of transportation.

A total of 1,540 responses were collected.

Communities are most concerned about safety (55.6%), the type of sound generated by UAM (49.3%), and the volume of that sound (48.8%). Drones already have a reputation for high-pitched whining, it would seem. Nobody wants that to become a permanent fixture of their daily lives. Respondents also had concerns about the time of day UAM vehicles would be flown (47.8%) and the altitude at which they will fly (47.8%).

Of least concern is arguably the most significant of infrastructure problems: the landing spot of the

aircraft (41.2%).

Importantly, Airbus says that 44.5% of all respondents’ initial reactions to UAM is in support or strong support. 41.4% of all respondents believe UAM is would either be safe or very safe.

We stand at a thrilling point in the history of aviation. The skies are busier than ever, and Airbus is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of commercial aircraft, helicopters, military jets, rockets, drones, and spacecraft, among others. Our industry’s prospects for the future are exciting, with current air traffic—that is, commercial and cargo flights and helicopters— having quadrupled in the last 30 years, and set to double in the next 15 [1]. Soon there will be an estimated 25,000 human-piloted flights in the air at any given moment [2]. Nobody would have imagined that future a century ago. But there is another change on the horizon. An entirely new category of airspace user is on the rise, with self and remotely-piloted aircraft developing rapidly. Soon, autonomous aircraft will be transporting people and goods all around the world.” – Tom Enders, Airbus CEO.

The Preliminary Community Perception Study was released by Airbus UTM, an internal group designing digital traffic management systems that could help new aircraft to safely integrate into our future skies.

Designing future transport with public opinion in mind

“As conversations progress around the world concerning the future of our airspace, Airbus UTM continues to be a leader in researching and designing the infrastructure that will allow for the safe advancement of this field,” said Isabel Del Pozo De Poza, Head of Airspace Management, Airbus UTM.

“We want to ensure our communities are educated on UAM and that experts in the industry keep their opinions top of mind when designing alternative transportation systems of the future.”

Getting into the finer details of the research, some additional findings – broken down by demographic – highlight some interesting perceptions by location and age:

67 percent of respondents living in Mexico City are likely or very likely to use UAM

46 percent of respondents living in Los Angeles are likely or very likely to use UAM

Those respondents most likely to use UAM have an average commute time of 25 minutes, compared to the group least likely to use UAM whose average commute time is 19 minutes

The 25-34 age range has the most positive initial reaction, with 55 percent viewing UAM positively, compared to the 75-84 age range with the least positive initial reaction, with 15 percent viewing it negatively

“While UAM has made great strides with key stakeholders, the public acceptance of the world’s communities is vital to the growth and pace of future adoption,” said Jessie Mooberry, Head of Deployment at Airbus UTM.

“We are actively looking to bring the voices of these citizens to the table as evidenced by ongoing work such as these surveys to involve all interested parties to join us in creating this mobile future. We look forward to further tapping these communities as we inform our further work in the field.”

TOULOUSE, France – European plane manufacturer Airbus said Thursday it will stop making its superjumbo A380 in 2021 for lack of customers, abandoning the world’s biggest passenger jet and one of the aviation industry’s most ambitious and most troubled endeavors.

Barely a decade after the 500-plus-seat plane started carrying passengers, Airbus said in a statement that key client Emirates is cutting back its orders for the plane, and as a result, “we have no substantial A380 backlog and hence no basis to sustain production.”

The decision could hurt up to 3,500 jobs and already cost the plane maker 463 million euros (about $523 million) in losses in 2018, Airbus said.

The end of the young yet iconic jet is a boon for rival Boeing and an embarrassing blow for Airbus, a European economic powerhouse. A pall of mourning hung in the atmosphere Thursday at its headquarters in the southern French city of Toulouse.

It’s also sad news for Emirates, which had the A380 as the backbone of its fleet, based out of Dubai, the world’s busiest airport for international travel.

Still, Airbus announced Thursday a 29-percent jump in overall profits last year, and analysts said global demand is high enough for Airbus to weather the loss of its superjumbo.

The plane maker reported net profit of 3.1 billion euros over last year, up from 2.4 billion euros in 2017. In addition to the A380 loss, Airbus reported a charge of 436 million euros on the A400M, used by several European militaries.

Airbus said it forecasts similar profits in 2019, in line with growth in the world economy and air traffic.

Emirates announced Thursday that it had struck a deal valued at $21.4 billion with Airbus to replace some A380s with A350 wide-bodies and smaller A330 planes.

“While we are disappointed to have to give up our order, and sad that the program could not be sustained, we accept that this is the reality of the situation,” Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the chairman and CEO of Emirates, said in a statement. “For us, the A380 is a wonderful aircraft loved by our customers and our crew. It is a differentiator for Emirates. We have shown how people can truly fly better on the A380.”

Emirates long has been the largest operator of the A380. Before Thursday’s announcement, it had 162 of the jumbo jets on order.

The A380 has been a favorite of Emirates’ passengers, especially those in business and first class, which encompassed the entire upper deck of the airplane and was complete with a bar in the back.

Airbus had hoped the A380 would squeeze out Boeing’s 747 and revolutionize air travel as more people take to the skies.

Instead, airlines have been cautious about committing to the costly plane, so huge that airports had to build new runways and modify terminals to accommodate it. The double-decker planes started flying in 2008 and seated more than 500 passengers.

The A380 had troubles from the start, including tensions between Airbus’ French and German management and protracted production delays and cost overruns. Those prompted a company restructuring that cost thousands of jobs.

Industry experts initially expected A380s to long outlast the 747, which is celebrating its 50th birthday this year.

When it started taking on passengers in 2008, the A380 was hailed for its roominess, large windows, high ceilings and quieter engines. Some carriers put in showers, lounges, duty free shops and bars on both decks.

"Why Airbus Retired the A380, the World's Biggest Passenger Plane | TIME - TIME","Thu, 14 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZS5jb20vNTUyOTQzOS9haXJidXMtYTM4MC1yZXRpcmVkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The aviation graveyard is littered with superlative aircraft that didn’t stay in the air for long. There’s Howard Hughes’ “Spruce Goose,” then the largest plane ever built and designed as a military hauler, which flew just once (a very generous definition of “flew”), but arrived too late for its intended role in World War II. There’s the Concorde, among the fastest passenger airliners to ever fly, which succumbed to high operating costs and noise rules spurred by its deafening supersonic boom. And now there’s the A380, currently the world’s largest airliner, which maker Airbus announced Thursday is being retired after just 12 years in commercial service.

The A380 is an engineering marvel and widely beloved by passengers. But economics shares no such sentiment. A four-engine superjumbo in what’s become a twin-engine world, the A380 is expensive for airlines to fuel and maintain. Then there’s the sheer passenger capacity of the beastly aircraft, which could fit anywhere from around 550 passengers to upwards of a mind-boggling 800, depending on the configuration. Those numbers are impressive on paper, but troublesome from a business perspective. The aviation industry is about “putting butts in seats,” as the saying goes. The more unfilled seats on any single flight, the more an airline can lose. That’s why airlines sometimes offer crazy discounts — getting something is better than getting nothing. With the A380, having that many seats can get you in serious trouble if you can’t find enough butts.

“Filling up 600 passengers is relatively difficult for an airline. It’s much easier if you, for example, sell tickets for a [Boeing] 787 with capacity of, say, 200 passengers,” says Bijan Vasigh, professor of economics and finance at Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University. “Airlines didn’t want to take the risk of selling 600 seats, and at the end only 60% of the seats are sold.”

There was a time when the A380 made sense — or at least, there was a viable argument for building it. It takes many years for a new airplane design to go from a glimmer in a designer’s eye to sitting at gate B37, waiting to haul you off to London or Hong Kong or wherever. The A380 program can be traced back as far as the late 1980s or early 1990s, depending on how you count. In the aviation world, those years were what we now understand to be the tail end of the superjumbo era, dominated by Boeing’s iconic 747 (another beloved aircraft that’s not long for the passenger-carrying world for similar reasons as the A380.) International airline routes were then built around mega-hubs. For the airlines, there was some logic in cramming as many people as you could onto a single flight between these hubs, then using smaller aircraft (or partnering with other airlines) to get people to their final destination.

Like any process as complex as putting a new superjumbo in the skies, the A380 suffered from numerous delays. As it finally got flying commercially in 2007, the international air travel business was starting to change. New fuel-efficient airplane and engine designs have been making it possible to do long-haul flights on twin-engine aircraft, like Boeing’s 787 and Airbus’ own A350 series (airplanes with half the number of engines tend to be cheaper to fuel and maintain.) Those aircraft are making it feasible for international airlines to run more direct routes to a wider variety of destinations, lessening the reliance on the megahub model and, in turn, making it less practical to stuff hundreds and hundreds of people onto a single plane. Indeed, it was Emirates’ decision to switch a handful of A380 orders to smaller aircraft that proved the program’s death blow.

While some passengers may lament the impending death of this remarkable aircraft, they stand to benefit from the changes that caused the A380’s demise, says Vasigh. “For business travelers … the more frequent flights will be more attractive,” he says. “If you have smaller aircraft, you’re able to provide more frequency, for example one flight in the morning from London to New York City and one flight in the afternoon with an aircraft of 250 seats. But if you’re using an aircraft with 600 seats, you would not be able to provide more than one flight.”

None of this is to say the A380 will disappear from the skies overnight. Airlines like Emirates and Qantas will likely keep flying it for years, in part because they’ll probably have trouble finding anyone who wants to buy them (eBay, anyone?) Airbus stressed on Thursday that it’ll keep supporting the aircraft long after it stops building new models. And while it’s something of an embarrassment for the European planemaker, the company has other aircraft waiting in the wings that make more sense in today’s aviation world.

The @Airbus A380 line will remain open for a few years. Until then, I highly recommended a pilgrimage to Hamburg to tour the production line.

And, as they always do, aerospace companies will keep chasing the superlatives they seem to love so much. Boeing just this month announced a “significant investment” in Aerion, a startup that hopes to make a sort of mini-Concorde supersonic business jet, while a similar startup, Boom, is backed by Sir Richard Branson. Never mind history, someone in the aviation world will always be chasing the titles of “biggest” or “fastest.” Whether they can make money that way is another question entirely."

And not only fly but soar so quietly, especially compared with the Boeing 747 it was designed to supersede and outclass. Passengers love it, but the A380 never completely took off among the airline buyers.

The announcement from Airbus that the final curtain will come down on the A380’s pan-European production line comes after years of speculation that the superjumbo was doomed. Orders had dried up in a risk-averse airline industry, whose economics and route networks were altered just at the wrong moment for the A380.

Airbus had nosed ahead of the pack in producing a plane that was built with lighter materials and was much more fuel-efficient, and potentially offered big savings and profits on routes where airlines could guarantee to load hundreds of passengers on every flight. It looked an ideal solution for the packed transatlantic corridors, where airlines would compete for scarce and expensive slots at intercontinental hubs such as Heathrow.

Even as the first A380 entered service in 2007, however, orders were piling up for a different plane still in the pipeline from rival Boeing. The 787 Dreamliner could fly a similar range on only two engines. This upstart took the use of lightweight composite materials a leap further and would need roughly half the number of passengers, 250 to 300 rather than the typical 550 on an A380, to make long-haul flights economically viable.

The hub and spokes model of aviation, in which airlines feed in passengers from connecting flights, and the bigger the long-haul plane the better, was being challenged. Low-cost aviation had given secondary airports fresh life, and passengers were increasingly used to direct, point-to-point flying. The need for Airbus’s expensive double-decker, its wings so wide that airport stands and equipment had to be remodelled to accommodate it, was fading.

The doubts escalated when so few customers were willing to take a punt on a plane whose future was in question. Only one airline, Emirates, appeared fully enamoured, placing giant orders that single-handedly sustained the A380 manufacturing programme. Few others had the deep pockets of the booming Gulf carrier, or customers rich enough to merit turning part of the plane’s spacious interior into a shower spa suite.

British Airways talked up the plane’s qualities but talked down the price. The Australian carrier, Qantas, was stung by teething problems as an early adopter, stalled on an order made in 2006 and finally cancelled it last week. Even Air France cut back on the plane assembled by its compatriots in Toulouse.

The most ominous sign was the news that two of the first A380s, still in their infancy in aircraft years, were being parked in the Pyrenees and stripped for parts. The aircraft had gone from great birds of the sky to mere organ donors in a decade. It was a more economical solution for their owner, the German leasing firm Dr Peters, than trying to hire them out to unwilling airlines.

When Emirates finally decided enough was enough, seeking to convert its order to newer, smaller models, it was game over. Few can blame Airbus for wanting to cling on and push this incredible plane, whose virtues are unquestioned. But the world it was built for has not materialised as Airbus had hoped.

The Airbus A380 is one of the most impressive and controversial airplanes in aviation history. And as the largest airliner in the world, the superjumbo is undoubtedly a technological wonder.

When the European planemaker dreamed up the A380 three decades ago, it was for an aircraft that would revolutionize air travel, with grand visions of unprecedented luxury for passengers and earnings power for airlines.

Things haven't worked out quite as well as Airbus hoped. Instead of becoming the workhorse of airlines around the world, the A380 has become relegated to niche duty for high-traffic airports and markets with congestion issues.

This week, Airbus confirmed that production of the A380 would end in 2021. Airbus CEO Tom Enders cited the lack of orders as the reason for the shutdown.

Although popular with passengers, just 274 A380s have been sold since the early 2000s, with nearly half of them — 123 — going to Dubai's Emirates.

Through January, Airbus has delivered 234 A380s to airlines around the world.

Long-time Teal Group aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia expects only 17 more planes to be delivered as Airbus shutters the production line.

Some industry observers, including Aboulafia, have gone so far as to call it the biggest mistake in the history of Airbus. According to Aboulafia, the A380 is a poorly executed aircraft designed for a market that doesn't really exist. As a result, the $25 billion that Airbus spent on the A380 program could have been better used elsewhere, like on a rival for Boeing's next-generation 777X or on a true replacement for the aging 757, Aboulafia told Business Insider.

Regardless, the superjumbo remains a truly impressive aircraft. The Airbus A380 is the company's most expensive airliner, with a list price of $445.6 million. That's more than $79 million more than Airbus' second-priciest offering, the A350-1000. It's nearly $43 million more than the Boeing 747-8 and $19.8 million more than Boeing's next-generation 777-9.

"Goodbye to the A380, the biggest passenger plane there ever was - Popular Science","Fri, 15 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHNjaS5jb20vZ29vZGJ5ZS1haXJidXMtYTM4MC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The largest commercial passenger plane in the world, the A380, is a double-decker behemoth with four engines, a wingspan of 262 feet, and a cabin that can hold more than 500 people. It has enough space inside of it, Airbus says, to fit 35 million ping-pong balls, if you count its cargo hold along with its two main decks. It first left the ground in 2005, and on Valentine’s Day 2019, Airbus announced it would stop producing the aircraft. The last vessels will be delivered in 2021.

The official cause of death is a smaller-than-expected number of orders from Emirates Airlines, which is the largest operator of the craft—although it will still receive 14 new A380s between now and 2021.

“It’s a marvel of aviation to see an airplane that large, and that humans can make things that big fly,” reflected Richard Anderson, director of the Eagle Flight Research Center at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. By the standards of modern jets, the A380’s production lifespan—it first flew commercially in 2007—is short. The 747, in comparison, first flew in 1969 and Boeing still has orders to fill.

William Crossley, a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at Purdue University, says ultimately, aircraft makers and airlines are discovering what the “right size” of an airplane should be. He says the top end of the market “is probably the A350-size.” Airbus says customers have ordered more than 1,000 A350s, but the A380 has had a total of just 273 orders, according to the BBC. That’s a huge difference considering the A350 first flew commercially in 2015.

An A350 can hold between 325 to 366 seats. Other wide-body, two-engine planes hold a similar amount. A Boeing 777 can accommodate between 317 and 396 people, and Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner can seat between 242 and 330. All of those planes are big, but hold fewer people than the A380. (Boeing is even working on a next-gen 777 with fuel-efficient wings so long, they’ll need to fold at the tips to fit at the gate.)

Decades of air travel trends would indicate that cramming more people on an airplane would be more profitable. “If you could put 500 people on the airplane, then the cost per mile is low,” Crossley says. But if an airline can’t fill all those seats, then the plane’s size becomes a liability, not an asset.

It’s a point that Anderson makes, too. Consider the flexibility that comes with an airline flying two 787s instead of one A380 on a route, he says. If the airline doesn’t sell enough seats, “then you can peel an airplane off,” he says. “You can’t peel half of a 380 off.”

The A380 also has four engines, which is double that on aircraft like the A350 and Boeing 787. And fewer engines comes with its advantages. “All other things being equal, two very large engines will be more fuel efficient than four engines that make the same amount of thrust,” Anderson says. Modern jet engines are big enough, and reliable enough, that even if one fails, the plane can make it to an airport on one, making the redundancy of four fuel-thirsty engines unnecessary.

Maintenance is simpler, too. “It’s quicker to overhaul two engines than it is to overhaul four,” says Crossley.

The A380 is survived by, among other Airbus aircraft, the company’s A350s and A330s, which Emirates is ordering 30 and 40 of, respectively. “Passengers all over the world love to fly on this great aircraft,” the CEO of Airbus, Tom Enders, said in a statement. “Today’s announcement is painful for us and the A380 communities worldwide. But, keep in mind that A380s will still roam the skies for many years to come and Airbus will of course continue to fully support the A380 operators.”"
Airbus A380: Superjumbo jet line will come to and end - USA TODAY,"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmF2ZWwvZmxpZ2h0cy90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTkvMDIvMTQvYWlyYnVzLWEtMzgwLXN1cGVyanVtYm8tamV0LWVuZHMvMjg2ODI1ODAwMi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"No more A380s? Why Airbus' bet on 'superjumbo' jets failed

It’s official: Airbus will pull the plug on its A380 double-decker jet.

The move was announced Thursday, and comes after much speculation about the future of Airbus’ “superjumbo” jet amid tepid sales.

The latest A380 is now expected to roll off the assembly line in 2021. With that, there will be no new A380s beyond then, though it's possible many of the A380s now flying will continue to do so for a decade or more.

The A380 is the world’s largest commercial passenger jet, capable of sitting 600 passengers or more. It marked a bold and ambitious project for Airbus, which bet airlines would want a giant plane that could fly more passengers into busy airports with no capacity for new flights.

Around the same time, Boeing made a contrary bet. Instead of a double-decked behemoth, the U.S. jetmaker figured its airline customers would be better served by a smaller widebody jet with low operating costs that could instead make frequent flights between cities. Or open up international routes between medium-sized markets too small to serve with larger widebody jets.

ARCHIVES: Emirates pushes A380 seating capacity past 600

Boeing’s Dreamliner, made partially from composite materials, began flying for airlines in 2011. Boeing has now received more than 1,400 orders for the jet, which remains a strong seller for the company. And, as Boeing predicted, it opened up new overseas routes from cities like Austin and New Orleans. Even Charleston, South Carolina, will soon have a new nonstop flight to London that will be operated by British Airways on Boeing Dreamliners.

Airbus’ later A350, a smaller widebody model also made partially from composite materials, followed Boeing’s 787, flying its first passenger flight in 2015. That line also has sold well for Airbus.

But the A380 never found a profitable niche.

TODAY IN THE SKY: Emirates airline shows off its Airbus A380 at Washington Dulles (story continues below)

The A380 seats more than 500 passengers in a standard seat configuration, though some airlines have versions that seat more than 600. The A380 could seat as many as 850 passengers in an all-economy class layout, though no airline has yet to do so.

While the A380 can carry more passengers than any other commercial passenger plane, the four-engine aircraft also is more expensive to operate compared to modern two-engine jets. For example, Boeing's two-engine 777 models are cheaper to operate and can seat nearly 400 passengers.

The A380 also required some airports to modify taxiways and airport terminals to be able to accommodate the giant jet.

TODAY IN THE SKY: For airlines, two engines are better than four

Even Boeing's iconic humped 747, its closest in capacity to the A380, has seen sales decline as passenger airlines increasingly prefer two-engine models that are less costly to operate.

""The very clear trend in the market is to operate long-haul aircraft with two engines [such as] Boeing's 787 and 777, and Airbus's A330 and A350,"" Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor of Flight Global, says to the BBC.

The A380 began flying for airlines just in 2007, when Singapore Airlines put the jet into passenger service.

Dubai-based carrier Emirates was an enthusiastic supporter of the jet, ordering nearly half of all the roughly 270 A380s Airbus is expected to have made before the line ends.

Beyond Emirates, however, the A380 never found the broad customer base Airbus envisioned.

No U.S. carriers ever gave serious consideration to ordering the jet. About a dozen other global airlines bought the jet, including Air France, British Airways, Korean Air, Lufthansa and Qantas, among others. But, aside from Emirates, the A380 was just a niche player in the fleets of most airlines to fly it.

For many of the A380’s current operators, the giant jet served as a canvas to create some of the most opulent passenger seats ever.

Singapore Airlines, already regarded as one of the world’s most luxurious carriers, used the A380 to roll out its spacious suites with private sliding doors and separate bed and siting areas. Emirates, along with United Arab Emirates rival Etihad, added showers to their versions of the jet.

Now, though, the line will soon come to an end.

Some will view the Aribus' move as a validation for Boeing’s focus on its Dreamliner. And, for Airbus, the short-lived run of its signature A380 product will be viewed as an embarrassing miscalculation. The Associated Press notes that “a pall of mourning hung in the atmosphere Thursday at (the Airbus) headquarters in the southern French city of Toulouse — but there was also a hint of relief after years of straining to keep the A380 alive.""

""It's a painful decision for us,"" CEO Tom Enders said. ""We've invested a lot of effort, a lot of resources, a lot of sweat ... but we need to be realistic."""

Airbus to Stop Making World’s Largest Passenger Plane - VOA Learning English,"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vbGVhcm5pbmdlbmdsaXNoLnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvYWlyYnVzLXRvLXN0b3AtbWFraW5nLXdvcmxkLXMtbGFyZ2VzdC1wYXNzZW5nZXItcGxhbmUvNDc4NzAxMi5odG1s0gFqaHR0cHM6Ly9sZWFybmluZ2VuZ2xpc2gudm9hbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL2FpcmJ1cy10by1zdG9wLW1ha2luZy13b3JsZC1zLWxhcmdlc3QtcGFzc2VuZ2VyLXBsYW5lLzQ3ODcwMTIuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European aircraft maker Airbus has announced it will stop making the world’s largest passenger airplane.

The French-based manufacturer said Thursday it plans to stop making the Airbus A380 in 2021. The A380 made its first test flight in 2005 and began carrying passengers two years later.

The A380 is the largest commercial airplane operating today. The plane has two full levels of seating and normally is equipped to carry at least 500 people.

The announcement came after the company experienced major drops in demand and sales of its A380 in recent years.

In the latest decision, Emirates – Airbus’ largest buyer of the A380 – chose to cut the number of aircraft it had already ordered. Airbus officials said Emirates’ decision left the company with no “order backlog” to support continued production of the plane.

Airbus chief Tom Enders said the decision to end the A380 program was a “painful” one. “We’ve invested a lot of effort, a lot of resources, a lot of sweat...but we need to be realistic.”

The decision could affect up to 3,500 jobs. It already cost Airbus about $523 million in losses in 2018, the company said.

Airbus said it would enter talks with labor unions in coming weeks over jobs that could be affected. Most of the positions at risk are in France and Germany, but workers in Spain and Britain also could be affected.

In a statement, the head of Emirates said the airline had been a strong supporter of the A380 from the beginning. It said the plane had become a favorite among many passengers and crew members. The decision to cancel the orders marked “the reality” of the current situation, the statement said.

Emirates said it had reached a new $21.4 billion deal with Airbus to replace some of the A380 orders with A350 wide-bodies and smaller A330 planes.

Airbus has promised airline companies it will keep supporting the more than 230 A380s currently in operation.

At first, many industry experts expected the A380 to outlast the Boeing 747, which is celebrating its 50th birthday this year. But many major airlines are increasingly turning to more mid-size planes to support regional flights.

Airbus to stop production of A380 | Arkansas Democrat Gazette - Arkansas Online,"Fri, 15 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMTkvZmViLzE1L2FpcmJ1cy10by1zdG9wLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tb2YtYTM4MC0yMDE5MC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TOULOUSE, France -- Airbus will cease production of its mammoth A380 passenger jet, an engineering marvel that nevertheless couldn't keep up with shifts in the way people fly, the European aircraft-maker said Thursday.

Citing reduced orders from Emirates Airline, a major customer, and an inability to find other buyers, the company said it would halt deliveries of the jumbo jetliner in 2021, although it said it would continue to support existing A380s.

""As a result of this decision we have no substantial A380 backlog and hence no basis to sustain production, despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years,"" the company's chief executive, Tom Enders, said in a statement. ""Today's announcement is painful for us and the A380 communities worldwide.""

The decision will lead to job cuts at Airbus, potentially affecting as many as 3,500 of its 134,000 employees over the next three years. Airbus said it would start discussions in the next few weeks about the consequences for its workforce.

The announcement overshadowed the company's announcement on Thursday of its full-year results. Its net income rose 29 percent in 2018 to about $3.5 billion.

Development talks for the plane began in 2000, meant to be Airbus' 21st-century answer to rival Boeing's 1960s-era 747, and one of the most ambitious endeavors in aviation. Its four Rolls-Royce engines were quieter than ever, far out on the extra-long wings. Carbon-fiber technology was used for the body to make it lighter and easier to maneuver. Its double-decker construction allowed room for bars, duty-free shops and even showers.

From its inception, the A380 was a grand European project. The wings, like those of all Airbus aircraft, came from the U.K., and components were ferried across the continent from production sites in Germany and France. The giant fuselage tubes were taken by barge and flatbed truck to the main facility in Toulouse, and the planes were then painted and kitted out in Hamburg. Teams from across the region joined colleagues at other sites during crunch times, the bulbous Beluga freight planes would crisscross countries with parts, and the A380 was a popular backdrop at air shows for politicians celebrating Europe's achievements.

Airbus spent $25 billion developing the aircraft, which can carry more than 500 passengers. It was built for a time when crowded airports would demand that planes carry more people to reduce congestion.

But flight traffic instead shifted to smaller planes, which are cheaper to maintain, flying to regional airports, a move that reduced demand for larger aircraft.

Emirates, the Dubai-based airline, was Airbus' main customer for the jumbo jet, with a fleet of more than 100, but the airline has scaled back its plans and will take delivery of just 14 more over the next two years.

One of the jetliner's first test pilots took a philosophical view. While he's ""feeling a bit sad"" about the news, Claude Lelaie said the giant plane will be remembered for pushing the barriers of aviation, like the supersonic Concorde.

""Both made history and allowed progress, technological progress,"" he told The Associated Press from the southern French city of Toulouse, the cradle of Airbus' worldwide operations. ""That's business -- you have to ensure the success of the company.""

Lelaie was a co-pilot aboard the maiden flight of the superjumbo in 2005, 101 years after the Wright brothers' first flight.

Yet to detractors, the A380 smacked of hubris, a vanity project by managers who saw bigger as better despite an uncertain market for a plane so huge that airports had to modify their runways and gates.

It faced repeated production setbacks and cost overruns. Order cancellations led to a restructuring at Airbus that saw thousands of job cuts.

""The 380 may have just been too large of a step for the market to handle,"" said Rob Watts, CEO of aviation consulting company Aerotask.

The chairman and CEO of Emirates, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al Maktoum, said: ""While we are disappointed to have to give up our order, and sad that the program could not be sustained, we accept that this is the reality of the situation.""

The fate of the superjumbo has been in question for at least a year, and Enders acknowledged in January 2018 that the company would not be able to continue production of the plane without an order from Emirates.

Airbus was thrown a lifeline with a $16 billion order from Emirates a few days later, but Airbus confirmed last month that it was in discussions about whether that deal would ever be realized. The A380 took another hit last week as Qantas canceled its order from 2006 for eight of the planes.

Emirates is not abandoning Airbus, however. The plane manufacturer said Thursday that the airline would emphasize two smaller models instead, the A330-900 and the A350-900.

Airbus was at pains to emphasize that A380s will not disappear anytime soon. ""Keep in mind that A380s will still roam the skies for many years to come, and Airbus will of course continue to fully support the A380 operators,"" Enders said.

The Airbus A380 superjumbo is the largest and most expensive commercial airliner in history, which once promised to revolutionize air travel with unprecedented luxury.

It turned out to be mostly a bust for Airbus, and Airbus has announced it will stop producing the Airbus A380.

The biggest A380 customer is Emirates Airlines, which operates 101 A380s. However, Emirates reduced its last order before Airbus made its production announcment.

I'd never flown on an Airbus A380 or on Emirates Airlines. On a recent trip to Dubai, I decided to try them both out with an economy-class ticket for the 13-hour flight from New York to Dubai.

The Airbus A380 was supposed to be the plane of the future.

With a price tag of $445.6 million and room for as many as 800 passengers, the A380 was designed to be a game-changer for the aviation industry in the same way the Boeing 747 was in the 1970s.

But not a lot of Airbus' ambitions have panned out. For most of the A380’s decade in service, Airbus has struggled to find airlines willing to put the A380 into service.

Except for Emirates, an airline ranked as the Middle East’s largest, the world’s fourth largest, and rated the fourth best in the world.

Emirates operates 101 A380s, the most of any airline. In January 2018, the airline ordered an additional 20 A380s, with an option for 16 additional jets. The deal, which single-handedly kept Airbus’ A380 program afloat, is worth $16 billion.

However, Emirates reduced its last order from 162 aircraft to 123, and Airbus has now announced that it will stop producing the Airbus A380 and turn its attention to lighter, sleeker aircraft. The change in production will put up to 3,500 jobs at risk.

Airbus to Halt Production on The Airbus A320 After Emirates Cancels Orders - Popular Mechanics,"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHVsYXJtZWNoYW5pY3MuY29tL2ZsaWdodC9haXJsaW5lcy9hMjYzNDEwNjgvYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1jYW5jZWxsZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A380's days of ferrying more than 500 passengers through the sky are numbered. On Thursday, Airbus announced it would not manufacture its venerable superjumbo airliner beyond 2021, with its main contractor, Emirates Airlines, uninterested in further orders.

Emirates, the Dubai-based carrier, decided to reduce its A380 fleet from 162 to 123 aircraft, which spurred this move by Airbus. The plane manufacturer will deliver 14 more jets to Emirates by 2021, but cease manufacturing the giant four-engine, double-decker aircraft afterward.

Instead, Emirates is poised to bolster its fleet with 40 of Airbus' newer generation A330-900 and 30 A350-900 planes, seizing on the trend of lightweight and fuel-efficient aircraft that carry fewer passengers between major hubs. Airbus Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders said in a statement:

“As a result of this decision we have no substantial A380 backlog and hence no basis to sustain production, despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years. This leads to the end of A380 deliveries in 2021. The consequences of this decision are largely embedded in our 2018 full year results.”

Although the A380 drew comparisons to the Concorde upon its debut in 2004, it ultimately failed to reinvent commercial air travel like the supersonic jet did decades earlier. The airliner did help Emirates bolster its reputation as a luxury carrier, with lavish suites often serving a wealthy clientele in and out of its main hub in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Emirates A380s would feature extravagant amenities such as showers and ample champagne.

But the fate of the airliner hinged largely upon Emirates, according to Enders, who recently delivered the news to analysts in a conference call. ""It's a painful decision,"" he said, according to CNN. He continued, saying:

""We've invested a lot of effort, a lot of resources and a lot of sweat into this aircraft. But obviously we need to be realistic. With the decision of Emirates to reduce orders, our order backlog is not sufficient to sustain production...""But keep in mind that A380s will still roam the skies for many years to come and Airbus will of course continue to fully support the A380 operators.""

The decision to curtail production could have a calamitous effect on Airbus'A380 manufacturing unit over the next few years, which employs 3,000 to 3,500 people. The company says ""the ongoing A320 ramp-up and the new widebody order from Emirates Airline will offer a significant number of internal mobility opportunities.""

The writing had been on the wall for the A380 for quite some time: In 2017, Delta CEO Ed Bastian admitted the hulking airliner's problems outweighed its benefits, saying: ""Most operators of the A380 I've talked to are not thrilled with the performance of the A380 given the cost.""

The company has delivered only 234 A380s since the debut flight in 2005, when it lifted off from Airbus' hometown of Toulouse, France, per CNN. That's a marked shortcoming of its original intention to deliver 1,200 planes.

Airbus' flagship plane is primed for a similar fate as another gargantuan aviation legend: the Boeing 747. Despite reaching its 50th birthday this week, Boeing has had a hard time delivering the once-vaunted jet, as airlines continuously seek smaller, fuel-efficient aircraft. While the 747 has fought off extinction by repurposing itself as a cargo plane, it remains to be seen whether the Airbus A380—a plane manufactured with the express purpose of luxury travel—can reinvent itself in a similar way.

Airbus ends the A380 program - Leeham News and Analysis,"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxOS8wMi8xMy9haXJidXMtZW5kcy10aGUtYTM4MC1wcm9ncmFtL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Feb. 13, 2019, © Leeham News: Airbus announced today (Seattle time, Feb. 14 in Toulouse) that it is terminating the A380 program.

The last airplane will roll off the assembly line in 2021, for Emirates Airlines.

Emirates cancelled an order for 39 A380s. In its place, the carrier ordered 30 A350s and 40 A330neos.

The Emirates and Airbus press release is here.

Move was expected

The move had been anticipated years, with speculation increasing in recent weeks as news emerged that Emirates, the largest customer by far for the airliner, couldn’t reach agreements with the engine makers on improvements; Qantas Airways canceled an order for eight in a long expected move; and Qatar Airways said it will start retiring its A380s at age 10.

Speculation also arose that Tom Enders, who retires as CEO in April, would kill the program to clear the decks for his successor, Guillaume Faury.

“The consequences of this decision are largely embedded in our 2018 full year results,” Enders said in a press release. The earnings will be released in a few hours.

With a production rate of 6/yr, the A380 is at best about break-even.

Changing market

When Airbus launched the A380 in 2000, the market was very different.

The Boeing 777-300/ER was launched the same year, but the plethora of twin-engine, twin-aisle, long range airplanes had yet to come.

The Boeing 787 was first, in December 2003. It was followed in succession by the A350, A330neo, increased range of the A330ceo, the 737 MAX and the A321neo/LR. Each airplane further fragmented markets that otherwise would go through hubs to fill the A380.

Airbus based the business case in part on analysis that passenger traffic doubles every 15 years and airport congestion would require the A380. It’s a story that’s been peddled since 2000, right through yesterday.

Simon Pickup, a middle manager who presents every year at the Pacific Northwest Aerospace Alliance annual meeting in Lynnwood (WA), acknowledged an announcement was expected Feb. 14 (Toulouse time, 9pm Wednesday Seattle time). He carried the long-standing Airbus message about the traffic and the need for Very Large Aircraft (now called Xtra Large in the Global Market Forecast). But he didn’t have advance information about the announcement.

XL forecast

Airbus still forecasts a 20-year demand for more than 1,500 “XL” aircraft (400 or more seats). This is filled by any aircraft, including the A330-300/900 and Boeing 777-300ER, configured with more than 400 passengers.

Cebu Airlines at one point configured the A330-300 with more than 400 passengers. Air Canada configured the 777-300ER with 458. The 777-9 nominally carries 425 in standard three-class, international configuration.

The A350-1000, nominally seating 365, could be configured with more than 400.

Boeing had been reducing the VLA category forecast for years, to a few hundred, before doing away with it entirely a year ago. Boeing’s forecast now goes to 300 seats, with 777s, A350s and A330-900s falling within this sector.

The rise and fall of the Airbus A380 superjumbo - CNBC,"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTkvMDIvMTQvYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtc3VwZXJqdW1iby10aGUtcmlzZS1hbmQtZmFsbC5odG1s0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMTkvMDIvMTQvYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtc3VwZXJqdW1iby10aGUtcmlzZS1hbmQtZmFsbC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An A380 aircraft under construction at an EADS factory in Toulouse, France Pascal Parrot | Getty Images

The European plane maker Airbus announced an end to its A380 superjumbo program, just 12 years after it first took to the skies. The future of the world's largest commercial jet-liner had long been in doubt after it became clear that it was heavily reliant on just one customer, the Middle East airline Emirates. CNBC takes a look at the plane that was built to revolutionize air travel, but found that the skies had already moved on.

The business case

Built as a direct response to Boeing's 747, the A380 program was officially launched in June 1994. The European plane was seen as a big bet that air travel would become ""hub and spoke,"" where large planes would carry out the first long leg to big airports before passengers would splinter off to their final destination in smaller jets.

watch now

While Boeing's 747-8 can carry around 470 passengers, the A380 holds at least 500 and has been configured by Emirates to carry as many as 600. The plane's huge number of seats was seen as key in helping to free up the air traffic overcrowding at several big airports such as London's Heathrow, New York's JFK and Chicago's O'Hare. Each plane is priced publicly at around $445 million although airlines negotiate steep discounts.

The plane takes to the skies

The A380 is mainly built in a 1.6-million-square-foot assembly plant at Airbus' headquarters in Toulouse. The very first version to fly took off from Toulouse in April 2005 and was first used commercially by Singapore Airlines in October 2007, flying between Singapore and Sydney. British Airways, Air France, Emirates and Air China have all been among the A380's 13 different carriers although no U.S., South American or African airline has ever placed an order. Customer feedback was positive as additional space, walk-up bars, and a quiet ride all pleased flyers. Airlines found they could charge a small premium on tickets as customers hunted for routes using the superjumbo.

What went wrong?

An Airbus A380 in Emirates livery. Airbus

Airbus' Global Market Forecast from the year 2000 predicted that 1,235 ""very large aircraft"" would be delivered to customers between 2000 and 2019. But as of January 2019, Airbus had received 313 firm orders and delivered just 234 aircraft. The firm's lofty target was swiftly undermined by the arrival of more fuel-friendly offerings such as Airbus's own A350 or Boeing's 787 Dreamliner. The smaller aircraft were lighter and could be run more efficiently as the expectation of a steep rise in passenger travel failed to materialize. It was also found that very few routes could operate the A380 at full capacity. Timing does seem to have been a problem. As the A380 hit the world's runways, a worldwide liberalization of flight routes known as ""Open Skies"" was underway. This allowed airlines to downsize their planes and fly more regularly. Added to that is the rise of the ultra long-haul flight. Airlines have asked both Boeing and Airbus to come up with planes that can haul passengers from one side of the world without stopping.

Freighter future?

Boeing's 747 has just celebrated 50 years in the air. Demand for that plane has also dipped sharply but it has found a new role as a freighter. But a cargo version of the A380 is seen as unworkable for one reason — it is too big. The plane would reach maximum payload long before it's actually full. One estimate is that an A380 could carry 60 percent more volume than a 747 but only 28 percent more weight, thereby making it inefficient. WATCH: Airbus on changing demands of airlines"
"Airbus abandons iconic A380 superjumbo, lacking clients - OCRegister","Thu, 14 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jcmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy10by1zdG9wLW1ha2luZy1zdHJ1Z2dsaW5nLWEzODAtc3VwZXJqdW1iby1pbi0yMDIxL9IBY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jcmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tLzIwMTkvMDIvMTQvYWlyYnVzLXRvLXN0b3AtbWFraW5nLXN0cnVnZ2xpbmctYTM4MC1zdXBlcmp1bWJvLWluLTIwMjEvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By ANGELA CHARLTON and JON GAMBRELL

TOULOUSE, France — European plane maker Airbus said Thursday it will stop making its superjumbo A380 in 2021 for lack of customers, abandoning the world’s biggest passenger jet and one of the aviation industry’s most ambitious and most troubled endeavors.

Barely a decade after the double-deck, 500-plus-seat plane started carrying passengers, Airbus said that key client Emirates is cutting back its orders, and as a result, “we have no substantial A380 backlog and hence no basis to sustain production.”

The decision could affect up to 3,500 jobs and already cost plane maker 463 million euros (about $523 million) in losses in 2018, Airbus said.

The company, a European economic powerhouse, is also girding for serious disruption to its cross-continental manufacturing from a likely chaotic British exit from the EU next month. CEO Tom Enders, however, said Thursday that “We are getting signals that make me a little more optimistic that we’ll see a more orderly Brexit.” He wouldn’t elaborate.

The end of the young yet iconic jet is a boon for rival Boeing and an embarrassing symbolic blow for Airbus. A pall of mourning hung in the atmosphere Thursday at its headquarters in the southern French city of Toulouse — but there was also a hint of relief after years of straining to keep the A380 alive.

“It’s a painful decision for us,” Enders said. “We’ve invested a lot of effort, a lot of resources, a lot of sweat … but we need to be realistic.”

It’s also sad news for Emirates, which has the A380 as the backbone of its fleet, based out of Dubai, the world’s busiest airport for international travel.

When it started taking on passengers in 2008, the A380 was hailed for its roominess, large windows, high ceilings and quieter engines. Some carriers put in showers, lounges, duty free shops and bars on both decks.

Airbus had hoped the A380 would squeeze out Boeing’s 747 and revolutionize air travel as more people take to the skies.

Instead, airlines have been cautious about committing to the costly plane, so huge that airports had to build new runways and modify terminals to accommodate it. The double-decker planes started flying in 2008.

The A380 had troubles from the start, including tensions between Airbus’ French and German management and protracted production delays and cost overruns. Those prompted a company restructuring that cost thousands of jobs.

Among early detractors of the A380 was analyst Richard Aboulafia of Washington-based Teal Group, who said its demise “was inevitable.”

“But thanks to the strength of the market right now, and the strength of Airbus’s other products, the damage will not have a huge impact on the industry,” he told The Associated Press. “For Boeing, it has been a very long time since they needed to worry about the A380 as a competitive factor.”

Airbus reported net profit of 3.1 billion euros over last year, up from 2.4 billion euros in 2017.

But it also reported losses: In addition to the A380 hit, Airbus reported a charge of 436 million euros on the A400M, used by several European militaries — and another 123 million-euro charge for complying with ethics rules as the company faces fraud investigations in the U.S., Britain and France.

Airbus also acknowledged Thursday that a recent data breach apparently targeted intellectual property. Guillaume Faury, head of Airbus commercial aircraft and future CEO of the overall group, said the company is taking technical and legal measures in response.

Airbus said it forecasts similar profits in 2019, in line with growth in the world economy and air traffic.

It promised airlines that it would still maintain the more than 230 A380s currently in flight, with Faury calling it a “benchmark” for the company even as its death is being programmed.

Emirates said Thursday it had struck a deal valued at $21.4 billion with Airbus to replace some A380s with A350 wide-bodies and smaller A330 planes.

Emirates has long been the largest operator of the A380. Before Thursday’s announcement, it had 162 of the jets on order.

“While we are disappointed to have to give up our order, and sad that the program could not be sustained, we accept that this is the reality of the situation,” Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the chairman and CEO of Emirates, said in a statement. “For us, the A380 is a wonderful aircraft loved by our customers and our crew. It is a differentiator for Emirates. We have shown how people can truly fly better on the A380.”

Industry experts initially expected A380s to long outlast the Boeing 747, which is celebrating its 50th birthday this year.

But airlines seem to increasingly favor more mid-size planes for regional routes, notably in Asia, instead of the hulking A380s or even 747s, increasingly used as a cargo plane."

TOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Loved by passengers, feared by accountants, the world's largest airliner has run out of runway after Airbus decided to close A380 production after 12 years in service due to weak sales.

The decision to halt production of the A380 superjumbo is the final act in one of Europe's greatest industrial adventures and reflects a dearth of orders by airline bosses unwilling to back Airbus's vision of huge jets to combat airport congestion.

Air traffic is growing at a near-record pace but this has mainly generated demand for twin-engined jets nimble enough to fly directly to where people want to travel, rather than bulky four-engined jets forcing passengers to change at hub airports.

And while loyal supporters like top customer Emirates say the popular 544-seat jet makes money when full, each unsold seat potentially burns a hole in airline finances because of the fuel needed to keep the huge double-decker structure aloft.

""It's an aircraft that frightens airline CFOs; the risk of failing to sell so many seats is just too high,"" said a senior aerospace industry source familiar with the programme.

Once hailed as the industrial counterpart to Europe's single currency, the demise of a globally recognised European symbol coincides with growing political strains between Britain, France, Germany and Spain where the plane is built.

That's in stark contrast to the display of European unity and optimism when the engineering behemoth was unveiled in front of European leaders under a spectacular light show in 2005.

British Prime Minister Tony Blair called the A380 a ""symbol of economic strength"" while Spanish premier Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero called the rollout ""the realisation of a dream"".

Passengers marvelled at the European giant with room for 70 cars on its wings, looking rather like the hump-backed Boeing 747 but with the top section stretching all the way to the back.

Airlines had initially rushed to place orders, expecting it to lower operating costs and boost profits as the industry crawled out of a slowdown in tourism since September 2001.

Story continues

Airbus boasted it would sell 700-750 A380s, which nowadays cost $446 million at list prices, and render the 747 obsolete.

In fact, A380 orders barely crossed the 300 threshold and the 747 has outlived its rival, after reaching the age of 50 this week.

FALL FROM GRACE

The seeds of the A380's fall from grace were already present behind the scenes of the 2005 launch party, insiders say.

Despite public talk of unity, the huge task was about to expose fractures in Franco-German co-operation that sparked an industrial meltdown. When the delayed jet finally reached the market in 2007, the global financial crisis was starting to bite. Scale and opulence were no longer wanted. Sales slowed.

At the same time, engine makers who had promised Airbus a decade of unbeatable efficiencies with their new superjumbo engines were fine-tuning even more efficient designs for the next generation of dual-engined planes, competing with the A380.

Finally, a restless Airbus board started demanding a return and stronger prices just when the plane desperately needed an aggressive relaunch and fresh investment, insiders said.

""It was a triple whammy,"" said a person close to the debate.

As demand see-sawed, so did the plane's marketing: starting with luxuries including showers, then vaunting its green credentials with the messianic slogan 'Saving The Planet One A380 at a Time"" before joining the race to squeeze in more people and cut costs.

Yet despite its own deep industrial problems, Boeing was winning the argument with its newest jet, the 787 Dreamliner. It was designed to bypass hubs served by the A380 and open routes between secondary cities: a strategy known as ""point to point"".

Airbus fought back, arguing that travel between megacities would nonetheless dominate air transport.

But economic growth would splinter in ways Airbus did not predict. Intermediary cities are growing almost twice as fast as megacities, according to a 2018 paper posted by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development.https://bit.ly/2P28F3h

That's a boon for twinjets like the Boeing 787 and 777 or Airbus's own A350, which has outsold the A380 three to one.

Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders, who was rarely seen as an enthusiastic backer of the A380, toyed with ending the project about two years ago but was persuaded to give it a last chance.

But with Emirates unable to hammer out an engine deal needed to confirm its most recent A380 order, time had finally run out.

""Airbus tends to think of it as a flagship; Enders looks at it and sees a lack of orders,"" said a person close to the German-born CEO, who steps down in April.

Some insiders worry that Airbus will lose a valuable symbol of pride and commercial audacity when production ends in 2021.

Now, airline bosses are seeking assurances that Airbus will support the A380 with spare parts for years to come. Many invested in the A380 as their flagship while airports also spent heavily on new facilities.

Some customers like Air France and Lufthansa may not shed too many tears, analysts say.

They too invested in the A380 but may also be relieved to see a potent weapon removed from Gulf rivals like Emirates, whom they accuse of flooding the market.

Emirates insists it plays fairly and has called the A380 a ""passenger magnet,"" misunderstood and badly marketed by rivals.

Its chairman said on Thursday he was disappointed in the A380's demise, but added ""we accept that this is the reality of the situation"".

The move came after Emirates, a vital customer, reduced its order of the supersized plane from 162 to 123. With no backlog of orders from other airlines, Airbus said it sees no reason to carry on making the A380.

The decision did not come easy. Airbus CEO Tom Enders said in a statement:

The A380 is not only an outstanding engineering and industrial achievement. Passengers all over the world love to fly on this great aircraft. Hence today’s announcement is painful for us and the A380 communities worldwide. But, keep in mind that A380s will still roam the skies for many years to come and Airbus will of course continue to fully support the A380 operators.

Though the day may be sad for jumbo-jet enthusiasts, it’s been a long time coming. Air travel has changed irrevocably since the A380 first took to the skies just over a decade ago. The hub-and-spoke model of the past relied on shuttling large volumes of passengers from one big city to another, and then ferrying them onwards with smaller aircraft. Today, the skies are ruled by leaner, more efficient wide-body jets with two engines, rather than four. Aircraft like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A350 carry fewer passengers on more direct routes and are built with materials that make the jets much, much cheaper to fly.

Boeing’s take on the double-decker four-engine jumbo jet, the 747, has also long been in decline. And while both of these aircraft will continue to fly for at least another decade, the era of aviation they represent—one marked by a touch of glamor and grandeur—has been replaced by something else entirely.

Low-cost long-haul carriers have stripped back the flying experience to the bare essentials, and legacy carriers have followed suit. This has coincided with the democratization of travel, which means that more people than ever are willing to fly, so long as they can do so as cheaply as possible—comfort be damned.

While Boeing’s 747 debuted in 1969—giving it a long, much-admired lifespan as the world’s first wide-body jet—the Airbus A380 only began commercial flights in 2007, arguably right around the time commercial aviation began to shift. The company delivered just shy of a quarter of the 1,200 planes it planned to sell when the aircraft first came on the scene."

Qantas said in a statement on Thursday that it would instead upgrade the 12 A380 planes that it already had, adding that “these aircraft have not been part of the airline’s fleet and network plans for some time.”

Airbus has already said the giant plane’s days could be numbered, acknowledging a year ago that it would have to end production if Emirates, its only major customer, did not order more.

A bet that airport congestion and increased international travel would lead to demand for larger planes, the A380 was pitched as a way for airlines to transport more passengers with limited landing slots. The aircraft can carry more than 500 passengers."
"Airbus invests €25 million in the future of its aerospace site in Ottobrunn/Taufkirchen, near Munich - Airbus","Mon, 11 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wMi1haXJidXMtaW52ZXN0cy1ldTI1LW1pbGxpb24taW4tdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS1vZi1pdHMtYWVyb3NwYWNlLXNpdGUtaW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"@Markus_Soeder #satellite @AirbusSpace

Ottobrunn/Taufkirchen, 11 February 2019 – Airbus is expanding its aerospace activities at its site in Ottobrunn/Taufkirchen, near Munich. Today, it has reached two new milestones, with Bavarian Minister-President Markus Söder and Dirk Hoke, CEO of Airbus Defence and Space, giving the green light for the modernisation of solar array production for satellites, and for the commissioning of expanded clean rooms for optical satellite instruments. In total, the company will be investing approximately €25 million.

In February 2019, Airbus will begin building an Industry 4.0 factory to automate and digitalise the production of solar arrays for satellites. This will entail a complete revamp of the production building, during which it will be expanded by 800 m2 to a total of 5,500 m2. A robotic assembly line will also be introduced. This €15 million investment demonstrates the company’s ability to remain competitive on the world market, while the automated assembly line will allow throughput times and costs to be halved. This state-of-the-art technology will safeguard 170 jobs and position the company to maximise future growth opportunities such as satellite constellations or ‘New Space’ approaches. Furthermore, ongoing cutting-edge research will be supported, particularly in the area of scientific satellites, such as the Jupiter mission or missions to the Sun or Mercury.

In addition Airbus will use the clean room (expanded by 250 m2 to a total of 1,700 m2) for the integration of satellite-based optical instruments, an area in which Airbus has invested over €10 million at its Ottobrunn/Taufkirchen site. The new clean room will be used by some of the 150 employees in the Optical Instruments business unit to build the MERLIN instrument (Methane Remote Sensing Lidar Mission). MERLIN is a Franco-German satellite project to measure the methane concentration in Earth’s atmosphere to improve understanding of climate change.

“The aerospace site in Ottobrunn/Taufkirchen has not only shaped the history of cutting-edge technology over the last 60 years, it is also actively shaping the future. Today, our solar array production marks our entry into the age of Industry 4.0, with the site now boasting the largest clean room for optical satellite integration in Germany. This will improve our competitive standing worldwide and will contribute towards safeguarding local jobs,” said Dirk Hoke, CEO of Airbus Defence and Space.

Airbus May Assemble Newest Jet in China to Secure Far East Deals - Fortune,"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAxOS8wMi8yOC9haXJidXMtamV0LWFzc2VtYmx5LWNoaW5hL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus SE is looking at assembling its newest A330neo wide-body jet in China as part of a bid to win orders for the plane in one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

Airbus may expand its existing plant in Tianjin to accommodate the model, but a decision has not been made with the business case yet to be established, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. The plan may not go ahead, they cautioned. A spokesman for Airbus declined to comment.

Airbus previously offered to build its A380 superjumbo in China in exchange for orders from the country’s airlines, but that pitch was rejected amid concerns about the double-decker plane’s suitability for the local market, according to two of the people. The smaller, more fuel-efficient A330neo is potentially a better fit, with more than 200 of the original-generation model already sold in the Asian nation.

The move to extend the Tianjin plant — which currently assembles Airbus’ single-aisle A320 workhorse — comes as Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc is said to be offering to establish a Chinese plant to secure an engine deal for the wide-body plane being developed by Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac. The U.K. company is pitching a derivative of the Trent 7000 turbine for that aircraft, which is also the only option on the A330neo.

Biggest Market

China is set to become the world’s biggest plane market next decade and will need almost 8,000 aircraft worth $1.2 trillion over 20 years, according to Boeing Co. estimates. President Xi Jinping has also earmarked aerospace as a priority industry, encouraging Western producers to set up shop in the country.

The A330neo — abbreviated from new engine option -— assembly plant would add to an existing completion and delivery center for Airbus’ original A330, where planes get final touches before being shipped to the customers.

The upgraded aircraft entered service last year but has been battling for orders with Boeing’s more advanced 787 Dreamliner. Airbus has secured sales for 230 A330-900s but just eight smaller -800s, losing contracts from Hawaiian Airlines Inc. and American Airlines Group Inc. along the way as they switched to the Boeing aircraft.

The Toulouse, France-based company has since won a 40-jet deal from Emirates, though only after the Dubai carrier canceled the bulk of orders for the A380, which Airbus announced earlier this month was being wound up. The company is also targeting a follow-on contract for 44 planes from Malaysia’s AirAsia that was announced but never signed."

Airbus proposing X³ offshoot for U.S. Army FARA program - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 20 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLXByb3Bvc2luZy14JUMyJUIzLW9mZnNob290LWZvci11LXMtYXJteS1mYXJhLXByb2dyYW0v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is proposing an aircraft that utilizes technology developed from its X³ hybrid demonstrator program for the U.S. Army’s Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft Competitive Prototype (FARA CP) program.

The X³ was a highly successful demonstrator for Airbus, setting several speed records through its use of two propellers on short wings either side of a Dauphin-based fuselage, topped by a five-bladed main rotor. The aircraft logged more than 155 flight hours over 199 flights, reaching a level flight speed of 255 knots (472 km/h) on June 7, 2013.

The Army launched the FARA competition in October 2018 when it issued a formal program solicitation, with the aim of finding a new armed scout aircraft for the service.

“This platform is the ‘knife fighter’ of future Army Aviation capabilities, a small form factor platform with maximized performance,” the solicitation stated.

Airbus was among those to submit a proposal in December 2018, with the first of four potential phases of program development scheduled to begin in June 2019.

“Yes, we are looking at the FARA demonstrator program, based on the technology we have developed . . . in terms of [a] high-speed platform based on the X³ in particular,” Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters, told journalists during a media briefing ahead of HAI Heli-Expo. “These competencies, this technology, we have developed years [ago]. Clearly we want to leverage them in order to propose a competitive solution first at a demonstrator phase for the U.S. DoD [Department of Defense] program.”

The Army will select four to six bidders to take part in the program’s initial phase, which will give candidates nine months to develop preliminary designs and provide data supporting their bid. From there, two or more will be downselected to take part in a detailed design, build and test phase.

If selected for the second phase, the contenders will receive about $735 million to cover their aircraft’s development from 2020 to 2023, with an anticipated first flight in November 2022.

Since the X³’s retirement in 2013, Airbus has continued the type’s legacy in the form of the Racer — a high-speed demonstrator intended for commercial applications.

“You can also envision a military path for that technology as well,” said Scott Tumpak, head of military programs in North America for Airbus. “We’re in a competitive phase right now, so we don’t want to get too far out in front by going into too much detail as to what the specific offer is.”

The Army’s parameters for the aircraft include a 40-foot rotor disc and a speed of 180 knots.

When questioned as to whether the rotor disc of an X³ offshoot could fit in that space, Tumpak said it would be one of the discussion points the manufacturer will have with the Army.

“The answer is always, you could, but at what cost to your tradespace and other areas?” he said. “In our mind, that is what the major purpose is of this initial design review is — to have that dialogue of what the tradespace is with the end customer.”

Sikorsky and Bell have also declared their interest in the program, with the former highlighting the suitability of its X2 technology for the armed reconnaissance mission."

Culminating two years of construction involving some 450,000 working hours, Airbus’ new Integrated Technology Centre at Friedrichshafen, Germany was officially inaugurated this month.

It sets new standards for the production and testing of Airbus space systems, incorporating 4,200 square meters of cleanroom space for the assembly and processing of spacecraft, their instruments and systems for use in missions that range from Earth observation and meteorology to navigation, astronomy and the exploration of deep space.

At the heart of this four-storey Airbus Space Systems site is a central clean room integration hall. Sized at 2,100 square metres, it can accommodate the construction of up to eight large satellites – as well as accepting large space telescopes with its ceiling height of 18.50 metres. In addition, two side wings of the facility have a combined area of 1,100 square meters for systems integration, well as laboratory areas for component manufacturing and a visitor centre.

Clean room technology for the central integration hall enables purity classes from ISO 8 to ISO 5 without the need for partitions.

Also included in the Integrated Technology Centre are facilities for thermal, vacuum, and vibration tests, along with chambers for the verification of electromagnetic compatibility between satellites and their systems.

One of the Integrated Technology Centre’s features is its sophisticated, high-tech ventilation system, which contributes to the highly clean working environment required for spacecraft and their sensitive instruments. Unique in Europe, the ventilation process decreases operating costs by up to 70% compared to conventional technology.

The new centre continues Friedrichshafen’s heritage of satellite development for Airbus, which has included assembly of the Ulysses solar probe, the Rosetta comet hunter and the BepiColombo mission to planet Mercury.

At the same time, it could cause headaches for the supply chain.

Carter Copeland of Melius Research LLC makes a split decision on the future of the A380. There is speculation that retiring Airbus CEO Tom Enders might decide to end the program before he leaves office in April, clearing the decks for his successor, Guillaume Faury.

Blessing in disguise

“The recent A380 news is…a blessing in disguise,” Copeland writes. “An Emirates A380 cancellation and likely shutdown of the A380 in the coming years should have a limited EBIT/cash flow impact, as many observers have already concluded. However, we think the indirect impacts on internal resources (sales, cost reduction, cross-subsidization) are still underestimated, as few appreciate the resources it takes to keep a dying aircraft program on life support. Furthermore, we strongly believe that an end to A380 production end would further rationalize the product portfolio in a way that is accretive to our margin-focused thesis longer-term.”

Or not

On the other hand, Copeland sees a negative impact for the supply chain.

“A380 production cessation is not a positive for everyone,” he writes. “It’s been awhile since we killed a major program outright, and usually the Street (and often industry) underestimates the impact on inventory de-stocking. Watch out for long-lead suppliers (ARNC) and distributors of longer-lead parts (WAIR), as this is where the surprises from violent inventory corrections have historically shown up.”

ARNC is the stock symbol for Arconic, a prime supplier of aluminum. WAIR is the symbol for Wesco Aircraft Holdings, a supply chain management company.

Airbus Beluga XL spreads its wings at long last - CNN,"Mon, 18 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWJlbHVnYS14bC1maXJzdC11ay1mbGlnaHQvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBR2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uL3RyYXZlbC9hcnRpY2xlL2FpcmJ1cy1iZWx1Z2EteGwtZmlyc3QtdWstZmxpZ2h0?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

It’s almost here.

One of the aviation world’s most hotly anticipated planes, the Airbus Beluga XL, has just completed a key round of testing at Hawarden Airport in Wales, ahead of entering service later this year.

At a time when jumbo passenger airliners such as the Airbus A380 and Boeing 747 are on their way out, the Beluga XL – the first of five – will be one of the biggest beasts in the skies.

You won’t be able to travel in it, though. This is a super-transporter cargo plane, designed by Airbus to fly its aircraft components between European production sites and its final assembly lines in Toulouse, Hamburg and Tianjin.

Modified A330

The Beluga XL is the successor to the Beluga, or Airbus A300-600ST, which has been in operation since 1995.

Starting with an A330 airliner, Airbus engineers lowered the flight deck and grafted a huge cargo bay onto the fuselage to create this unusually shaped plane.

Through an upward-opening forward hatch on the “bubble,” completed aircraft wings, fuselage sections and other components easily slide in and out.

The XL’s bubble is six meters longer and one meter wider than the original, meaning its cross-section is a whopping eight meters wide.

Putting the ‘fun’ in functional

The plane’s distinctive bulbous shape has earned it the nickname “the flying whale,” due to its strong resemblance to the white-colored Arctic-dwelling mammal, the beluga.

The XL’s twinkly-eyed, smiling-faced livery capitalizes on this. The whimsical design was chosen by Airbus staff following a poll in which 20,000 employees were given six options and asked to choose their favorite. With 40% of the vote, it was the clear winner.

“We used to say that in Toulouse or in Hamburg, the kids recognize the Beluga,” Bertrand George, head of the Beluga XL program, tells CNN Travel. “They love this very special plane.”

However, the design is functional as well as cute. The enormous cargo bay is large enough to carry two A350 wings at a time (the old Beluga could transport only one), and the whale-like nose improves the craft’s aerodynamic efficiency.

Nature, after all, perfected the beluga whale and, explains Grosse, “flying in the air is a little bit like swimming in the sea.”

Pilot training

So how does one go about steering a machine like this through the skies? Well, says George, despite the plane’s unusual appearance, “for the pilots this is really an A330. Our pilots will be trained on the A330 and then they will get a Delta qualification to enable them to fly the Beluga XL.”

While you might think the aircraft would run slower, “the drag is about the same,” says George. “What changes really is the behavior of the aircraft at the rear, at the bottom of the cargo bay.

“This is why we have lifted the vertical tail plane by more than two meters to get it out of the flow behind the cargo bay and we have also the special acceleration on the horizontal tail plane to give stability to the aircraft.”

The Beluga XL is powered by two Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines, which, as with its wings, are also used on the A330.

Preparations for a very special guest

Airbus manufactures its wings in a large factory at Hawarden Airport.

The facility has undergone special modifications for the arrival of the Beluga XL, such as creating two sets of doors for the Beluga Line Station – one to fit the Beluga and one to fit the Beluga XL.

Airbus also resurfaced the landing strip, erected blast fences (to safely redirect the engines’ high-energy exhaust) and installed new turn pads – necessary for when the Beluga XL turns around on Howarden’s relatively short runway of around 1,600 meters.

Plane-lovers from across the UK gathered in Wales to see the arrival of the Beluga XL on Thursday, and again to see it depart for Toulouse, France, on Saturday.

“This plane is, I would say, iconic for our company,” George tells CNN Travel. “This is the workhorse for Airbus. So it is more than a plane. It is what enables Airbus to build aircraft every day.”"
Airbus Foundation launches youth development programme in Botswana - Airbus,"Mon, 25 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wMi1haXJidXMtZm91bmRhdGlvbi1sYXVuY2hlcy15b3V0aC1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1wcm9ncmFtbWUtaW4tYm90c3dhbmHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Gaborone, Botswana, 22 February 2019 – The Airbus Foundation, together with its partners – The Little Engineer and Dare to Dream – has launched the Airbus Little Engineer robotics programme in Botswana. The goal of the initiative is to encourage learners to understand and embrace technology, and ignite passion that could grow into an exciting career in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).

During its first year, the programme aims to reach at least 1,080 ten to sixteen year olds from urban and rural areas across the southern African country



Botswana-based Dare to Dream, organisation has become synonymous with advancement of women and girls in STEM, aviation and aerospace business leadership skills. The organisation was founded by Captain Kgomotso Phatsima, Botswana Defence Force’s first women pilots. Captain Kgomotso uses the power of flight to ignite dreams and help other young women to follow in her footsteps.



The Airbus Little Engineer programme, which is for girls and boys, began with two days seminars for Dare to Dream’s trainers, familiarizing them with the Airbus Little Engineer programme. These were followed by a workshop at the Botswana Innovaion Hub, involving 30 learners from Gaborone, Ramotswa and Bobirwa.



During this workshop the 30 learners were introduced to the exciting world of aviation, robotics and coding. The students were tasked to assemble an aircraft model, program it with their own algorithm so it is able to manoeuvre on the tarmac, ready for take-off.



""The inherent and extensive nature of science, innovation, engineering and aerospace technology offers boundless possibilities and opportunities for Botswana and its socio-economic development. They are essential to the realisation of Botswana Vision 2036 of achieving a knowledge based economy, the African Union Agenda 2063 of ‘The Africa We Want’ and the UN sustainable development goals.” Said Captain Kgomoto Phatisma



Programmes like the Airbus Little Engineer are designed to support these goals by helping to equip and prepare the future generation of talent needed to take societies and economies forward. Dare to Dream aspires to be the leading social entrepreneur advancing the next generation of aviation and space leaders as well as business aviation leaders of tomorrow not only in Botswana but across the African Continent.



Since its launch in 2012, the Airbus Little Engineer programme successfully positioned itself as an effective vehicle for discovery-based learning, working to enlighten and empower youth in the areas of science and technology through robotics and aerospace. The programme has reached more than 5,800 students and is operating in more than 12 countries.

Airbus Will Stop Producing Its Famous Double Decker Plane in 2021 - Travel + Leisure,"Fri, 15 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFuZGxlaXN1cmUuY29tL3RyYXZlbC1uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tZW1pcmF0ZXMtY2FuY2Vscy1vcmRlctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus announced this week that it will end production of the world’s largest passenger jet, the A380, in 2021.

Emirates reduced a previous order of 53 A380 aircraft to just 14, and Airbus said it will no longer take new orders and will halt production of the aircraft.

“As a result of this decision we have no substantial A380 backlog and hence no basis to sustain production, despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years,” Airbus CEO Tom Enders said in a statement. “This leads to the end of A380 deliveries in 2021.”

The famous double-decker plane took its first commercial flight with Singapore Airlines back in 2007. Since its inception, Emirates has been Airbus’s main customer for the aircraft — but Emirates switched its large A380 order to 70 of the smaller and more fuel-efficient A330 and A350 aircraft.

“What we’re seeing here is the end of the large, four-engine aircraft,” Enders said at Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, according to The Guardian. The death of the A380 signals a growing trend towards smaller, two-engine planes that are most cost-efficient for airlines to operate.

The gigantic A380 is capable of carrying more than 850 passengers, and its birth signaled what manufacturers thought would be the start of the megajet era. When the A380 debuted in 2005, Airbus had hoped on manufacturing 1,200 of the aircraft. To date, it has only produced 234, according to CNN.

But although there won’t be any new A380 after 2021, the aircraft won’t disappear from the skies for quite a while. The plane will still be used by airlines like Singapore, Emirates, British Airways, Air France, and All Nippon on some of its longhaul flights."
Airbus will end A380 superjumbo production in 2021 - The Air Current,"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYWlyY3VycmVudC5jb20vZGlzcGF0Y2hlcy9haXJidXMtd2lsbC1lbmQtYTM4MC1zdXBlcmp1bWJvLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24taW4tMjAyMS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It’s over: In the end it was the market, not the market forecast, that determined the fate of the Airbus A380. Emirates airline ended its deliberation about the future of its largest airplane, cancelling an order for 39 A380 aircraft and orders 40 A330-900neos and 30 A350-900s in their place.

As was widely expected, the change has brought the end of the Airbus superjumbo. “As a result of this decision we have no substantial A380 backlog and hence no basis to sustain production, despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years. This leads to the end of A380 deliveries in 2021,” said Airbus Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders said in a statement.

Related: Boeing 787 deal in jeopardy, too, as Emirates weighs killing A380 for A330neo

The timing of the decision is notable given the rolling leadership succession at Airbus. This places the “painful” decision to sunset the A380’s at the end of Enders’ tenure, not the first major decision of Guillaume Faury’s administration, which is set to begin later this spring. With its demise, Airbus will only offer two engine airplanes for the first time since 1986 just prior to the launch of the A340.

Emirates has 14 A380s remaining on order and will eventually have a total of 123 in its fleet at the conclusion of the production run. Given the Emirates decision and the likelihood orders from Air Accord and lessor Amedeo will materialize, the A380 production run should end with approximately 251 deliveries since 2007.

Before it combined the A380 and A350-1000 into a single “extra large” demand category in 2018, Airbus in 2017 was of the belief that 1,410 superjumbos would be needed over two decades. In 2007 that stood at 1,283.

The decision by Emirates came almost in parallel with a similar decision by Etihad Airways to significantly scale back its own committed orderbook. It will now take five Airbus A350-1000s (down from 62), 26 A321neos and six Boeing 777-9s (from 35) “over the coming years”. -J.O."

"Airbus, Dassault tapped to pin down Franco-German fighter plans - Defense News","Wed, 06 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9nbG9iYWwvZXVyb3BlLzIwMTkvMDIvMDYvYWlyYnVzLWRhc3NhdWx0LXRhcHBlZC10by1waW4tZG93bi1mcmFuY28tZ2VybWFuLWZpZ2h0ZXItcGxhbnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"COLOGNE, Germany — The French and German defense chiefs announced a contract award to Airbus and Dassault Aviation on Wednesday to narrow down the two governments’ vision of a common, sixth-generation aircraft.

The announcement moves the ambitious Future Combat Air System project further along, authorizing the contractor duo to come up with more concrete concepts for the future weapon’s main elements. Those include the manned aircraft at the center of the project, unmanned drones swarming around it and the data infrastructure tying all elements together.

The two-year deal is worth €65 million (U.S. $74 million) and is meant to lay the groundwork for demonstrator programs to be launched at the Paris Air Show in June, according to a joint Airbus-Dassault statement.

“FCAS is one of the most ambitious European defense programs of the century,” Airbus Defence and Space chief Dirk Hoke said in a statement. “With today’s contract signature, we are finally setting this high-technology program fully in motion.”

Dassault head Eric Trappier touted his company’s chops as ""systems architect and integrator” in the statement — a likely reference to the prized job of overseeing how all components work together. “This new step is the cornerstone to ensure tomorrow’s European strategic autonomy,” he said.

The FCAS program is meant to replace France's Rafale and Germany's Eurofighter aircraft sometime around 2040. Officials have termed the envisioned aircraft a sixth-generation weapon. With it comes the ambition for the European industry to skip an aircraft generation, having never built a plane on par with the F-35.

For the moment, the program is riding on the wave of enthusiasm for the Franco-German defense relationship envisioned by French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. At the same time, cultural differences are beginning to bubble up that register anywhere between one country’s boisterous assertiveness in global defense policy and the other’s propensity for calculated hedging.

For example, French industry executives have complained that defense cooperation with Germany could hurt their chances of exporting the joint products to countries that Berlin considers rogue nations because of human rights abuses.

Meanwhile, the French and German defense secretaries, Florence Parly and Ursula von der Leyen respectively, also announced Wednesday that a team of Franco-German engine makers, made up of Safran and MTU, would spearhead development of the future aircraft’s propulsion system. The two governments expect to sign a contract for an engine demonstrator in mid-2019, according to a statement from the French Armed Forces Ministry.

Parly and von der Leyen inaugurated a new Safran plan in Paris Wednesday where engineers will develop a new generation of turbine blades. The company received a €115 million study contract toward that end.

Airbus to cancel A380 programme after Emirates cuts order - Aviation Week,"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcnBvcnRzLW5ldHdvcmtzL2FpcmJ1cy1jYW5jZWwtYTM4MC1wcm9ncmFtbWUtYWZ0ZXItZW1pcmF0ZXMtY3V0cy1vcmRlctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has confirmed it will cease production of its A380 superjumbo after Gulf carrier Emirates reduced an outstanding order for 53 aircraft to 14.

The manufacturer said it had taken the “painful” decision because it has “no substantial A380 backlog and hence no basis to sustain production”.

Emirates will receive 14 more A380s from 2019 until the end of 2021, taking its total A380 order book to 123 units.

“As a result of this decision we have no substantial A380 backlog and hence no basis to sustain production, despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years. This leads to the end of A380 deliveries in 2021,” said Airbus chief executive Tom Enders.

“The A380 is not only an outstanding engineering and industrial achievement. Passengers all over the world love to fly on this great aircraft.

“Hence today’s announcement is painful for us and the A380 communities worldwide. But, keep in mind that A380s will still roam the skies for many years to come and Airbus will of course continue to fully support the A380 operator.”

Emirates’ revised order with Airbus instead comprises 40 A330-900 aircraft and 30 A350-900s.

Highness Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, chairman and chief executive of Dubai-based Emirates, said the airline has been a “staunch supporter” of the A380 since its inception and admitted the decision to reduce its order was “disappointing”.

But he added: ““Emirates’ fleet strategy to operate a young, modern, and efficient all-wide body fleet remains unchanged.

“The 40 A330neos and 30 A350s that we are ordering today will complement Emirates’ fleet mix, support our network growth, and give us more flexibility to better serve seasonal or opportunistic demand.

“Both the A330neos and A350s will play an important role in our future fleet and network plans.”

The A380 had its first commercial flight in 2007 with Singapore Airlines and continues to remain popular with passengers. It has delivered a total of 234 aircraft.

However, orders have dwindled in recent years and the programme has been under threat for some time."
Delta hits a home run with Airbus A220 passenger experience - Runway Girl Network,"Sun, 10 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTkvMDIvZGVsdGEtaGl0cy1hLWhvbWUtcnVuLXdpdGgtYWlyYnVzLWEyMjAtcGFzc2VuZ2VyLWV4cGVyaWVuY2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Few airlines in the world take product consistency as seriously as Delta. When it inducted the Airbus A220 into its operations, the carrier went to great lengths to ensure this small but extremely capable mainline aircraft is as similar to its legacy Airbus and Boeing narrowbody fleets as possible. In almost all regards, it met or exceeded its own standards.

After years of retrofit programs, every one of Delta’s Airbus A320s, Boeing 737s, and Boeing 757s offer very similar products, and the new A220 is no different. It features nose-to-tail seatback entertainment with 110-volt power and USB ports at all seats, as well as 2Ku satellite Internet from Gogo.

Up front, the aircraft features 12 Collins Aerospace MiQ First Class seats pitched at 37 inches, although the bulkhead row lacks a cutout for passengers’ feet, leaving that row feeling quite tight compared to the others.

The rather small Comfort+ cabin contains just 15 extra legroom seats pitched at 34 inches, while the 82 Main Cabin seats range in pitch from 30 inches up to 32 inches.

Most Main Cabin seats maintain an exceptionally comfortable 18.6-inch width, the widest in Delta’s domestic fleet. With its large windows and generously wide seats, the A220 is a very comfortable ride in nearly any seat.

The biggest attraction on board Delta’s A220 is actually something a regular passenger will never know about, and that’s by design. The A220 features the new joint Gogo and Delta Flight Products (DFP) hybrid wireless seatback entertainment system.

While Delta has exclusively installed seatback systems provided by Panasonic Avionics in the past, the airline has developed its own in-house system for future retrofits of other aircraft.

For a first generation system, DFP and Gogo knocked it out of the park. The user interface, look and feel of this system exactly mirrors Delta’s older generation Panasonic systems.

To the passenger using the system, there is no difference. The welcome screen, menus, and content selection screens are all an exact replica from the Panasonic systems. In fact, the new system seemed to be more responsive and quicker than the Panasonic systems I have used on Delta in the past.

The reversible USB-A port kept my busy iPhone fully charged up, though I would like to have seen some future-proofing with a USB-C port as well. The DFP system does not allow for Bluetooth audio, which is another feature I would like to see added in the future.

The massive content catalogue on board this medium-range aircraft rivals or bests what most long-haul airlines offer; there’s something for everyone to watch.

Even though content is streamed wirelessly to the individual screens, I experienced no lag in video playback while initially loading videos, or while scrubbing through the timeline while playing something back. This is something many legacy systems struggle with.

That is not to say the new system was perfect, however. The massive content catalog was not properly categorized, making it difficult to search for the right movie. Gone with the Wind is not a science fiction movie, nor is Grease a fantasy film.

The bulk of the problems I experienced involved the Collins Aerospace Airshow product, which is new to Delta and a break from its past use of FlightPath3D’s 2D mapping software. The initial load of Airshow took several minutes as the system extracted more than 14,000 files and passengers waited for several minutes.

The Airshow product contained more glitches than a final release product should, including constantly displaying the air speed as 999 knots and showing the aircraft banking to the right as it actually banked to the left.

Delta recently announced it has teamed up with Gogo to provide live TV content to its aircraft with 2Ku, integrating the 18 or so live channels right into its Panasonic seatback systems on other aircraft. On the A220, however, that hasn’t happened. The live TV option was nowhere to be found on the seatback system, and was relegated to the Wi-Fi portal to be streamed to individual devices.

Delta has been able to display live TV content on its legacy Panasonic systems, so this is an odd omission. The live content streamed well, but with a significant time delay. The feed appeared to be 5-7 minutes delayed, which if following a sports event on social media would render the feature quite useless.

Overall, Delta has hit a home run with its Airbus A220. At the end of the day, many passengers still don’t know what type of aircraft they’re on, be it an A319, A220, or 737-900ER. On Delta, however, it may not really matter. Aside from the much larger windows and 3-2 seating configuration in Main Cabin on the A220, there’s not much else to set these aircraft apart, and that’s exactly how Delta wants it to be.

The livery (exterior painting) originates from the 1980s, when Austrian Airlines managed to re-enter the intercontinental flight business after a long hiatus. Core elements of the aircraft design are the angular chevron (logo arrow), its grey aircraft belly and the traditional red-white-red flag on the tailfin of the aircraft.

Special connection to New York and Tokyo

The retro look is a tribute to New York and Tokyo. New York has been part of the flight network of Austria’s red-white-red flag carrier for 50 years (except for a break in the 1970s), whereas Austrian’s flight service to Tokyo is celebrating its 30th anniversary (also with some interruptions). In 1989, two Airbus A310 aircraft, named New York and Tokyo, became part of the Austrian Airlines’ fleet in order to commemorate the anniversary of the two destinations. Today, New York and Tokyo are among Austrian Airlines’ most successful long-haul destinations.

Nine days in the painting hangar

A full nine days were required in the “Air Livery” painting hangar in Bratislava until the aircraft was able to reveal its retro design. The complete exterior painting of the A320 aircraft weighs approximately 246 lbs. and consists of three layers. The main colors are white, grey and red. The airplane is expected to land in Vienna this evening at about 10:30 p.m. local time. For spotters, it is important to note that the aircraft will be prominently placed at parking position F04 at Vienna Airport.

Austrian Airlines

Austrian Airlines is Austria's leading airline. The once state-owned and still convincing red-white-red airline operates a route network of around 130 destinations. Thanks to its favourable geographical location and Austrian history as a melting pot of the former crown lands, its home airport Vienna Schwechat is still a hub between East and West today. About 120 of the 360 daily flights lead to Central and Eastern Europe. “AUA"", as it is often abbreviated in Austria, transports around 14 million passengers a year and employs 7,000 staff from 58 nations. AUA has been part of the Lufthansa Group since 2009. Austrian Airlines is also a member of the Star Alliance, the first global alliance of international airlines. Austrian Airlines has been in the black since 2012. It celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2018.

British Airways announced a multi-billion dollar order for up to 42 Boeing 777 fuel-efficient passenger jets on Thursday, just two weeks after Airbus said it would no longer make its A380 superjumbo.

BA-parent IAG said its British carrier would purchase 18 777-9 planes made by the US giant, while an option for a further 24 of the aircraft could bring the total cost to $18.6 billion (16.3 billion euros) at list prices, before the usual heavy discounts are factored in.

It comes as IAG, which owns several airlines including Iberia and Aer Lingus, said that group net profits last year soared 45 percent to 2.9 billion euros on higher passenger numbers and lower costs.

Separately, UK engineering group Rolls-Royce said it dived into a net loss last year as its Trent jet engines were hit by costly repairs—as well as the decision by Boeing's European rival Airbus to pull the plug on the A380.

IAG on Thursday said the 777s would replace BA's Boeing 747s, which were seen as a competitor to the A380.

Rolls posted an annual loss after tax of £2.4 billion ($3.2 billion, 2.8 billion euros) in 2018 that followed a net profit of nearly £3.4 billion a year earlier, as the group also decided to axe thousands of jobs as part of vast restructuring.

The British company also said it no longer wished to be a candidate to make the engine for a new midsize passenger jet proposed by Boeing.

""Rolls-Royce has decided to withdraw from the current competition to power Boeing's proposed middle of the market—or New Midsize Airplane (NMA)—platform,"" Rolls said in a statement.

""While we believe the platform complements Boeing's existing product range, we are unable to commit to the proposed timetable to ensure we have a sufficiently mature product which supports Boeing's ambition for the aircraft and satisfies our own internal requirements for technical maturity at entry into service.""

Rolls-Royce posted a net loss last year as its Trent engines were hit by costly repairs

Chicago-based Boeing is looking at building an NMA, or single-aisle commercial jet for long-haul journeys, to fill a gap in the market—but concrete plans have yet to be announced.

Trent troubles

On Thursday, Rolls said that costs linked to problems with its Trent 1000 engine that powers the Boeing Dreamliner stood at a higher-than-expected £790 million in 2018.

The Trent 1000 has seen some parts wear quicker than expected, forcing Rolls to carry out expensive repairs.

It added that last year's earnings were hit by an additional £186 million ""following Airbus' decision to close the A380 production line"".

On British Airways' big Boeing order, IAG chief executive Willie Walsh said in a joint statement:

""The new 777-9 is the world's most fuel efficient longhaul aircraft and will bring many benefits to British Airways' fleet.

""It's the ideal replacement for the 747 and its size and range will be an excellent fit for the airline's existing network,"" Walsh added.

Earlier this month, Airbus said it would stop building the A380 superjumbo.

A British Airways A380 superjumbo, which the chief of BA-parent IAG has said were ""excellent"" aircraft

The European titan axed production of the double-decker jet on February 14 after failing to win over enough airlines to justify its massive costs.

Prior to Airbus' announcement, Walsh had said that IAG was ""very pleased"" with the 12 A380s operated by BA and called it an ""excellent"" aircraft.

However, Walsh had criticised the high cost of the A380, pointing to the ""great competition"" currently existing between aircraft manufacturers.

Speaking Thursday of the BA order, Kevin McAllister, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said:

""The 777-9, in particular, simply has no competitor in its class when it comes to efficiency and performance.

""It is the right-sized airplane for British Airways to efficiently serve long-range routes with heavy passenger demand.""

Despite news of IAG's bumper profits, the airline's stock slid 0.2 percent lower to finish at 599 pence on London's FTSE 100 shares index, which closed down 0.46 percent.

Boeing's share price advanced 0.54 percent to $437.81 in early trades in New York.

The news comes amid troubled times for smaller airlines, who are more exposed to volatile jet fuel prices, Brexit uncertainty and a global economic slowdown than their larger rivals.

""The British Airways parent has produced an outstanding performance, which is particularly impressive given the difficulties being faced elsewhere in the airline industry,"" noted Interactive Investor analyst Richard Hunter.

Airbus pitches H135 as 'low-risk' option for U.S. Navy trainer program - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 20 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLXBpdGNoZXMtaDEzNS1hcy1sb3ctcmlzay1vcHRpb24tZm9yLXUtcy1uYXZ5LXRyYWluZXItcHJvZ3JhbS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters is pitching its H135 light twin as the lowest risk solution to the U.S. Navy’s helicopter trainer replacement program.

If chosen, the H135 would provide the Navy with a twin-engine training aircraft that has a modern glass cockpit, four-axis autopilot, integrated flight management system, and is certified for instrument flight rules (IFR) operation. While such a twin-engine platform would clearly not be cheap, Airbus believes the aircraft’s maturity and competitive lifecycle costs will prove appealing to the Navy following a request for proposals that prioritizes technical capability over price.

As detailed in the RFP issued Jan. 28, the Navy is looking for a fleet of 130 helicopters for initial rotary-wing training to replace its aging fleet of Bell TH-57 Sea Rangers, which were originally fielded in the 1970s.

The TH-57 currently serves to bridge Navy rotary-wing pilots from initial flight training in the fixed-wing Beechcraft T-6B to the Navy’s fleet rotary-wing aircraft, the Sikorsky MH-60 Seahawk.

“Where we see an advanced value proposition with an advance trainer like the H135 is an opportunity to kind of keep that steady build-up of skills . . . by moving from the TH-6 and maintaining the glass cockpit, [having an ] introduction to an advanced autopilot and the twin engine skills that translate to the fleet aircraft,” said Scott Tumpak, head of military programs in North America for Airbus.

Airbus believes the Navy is “engine agnostic” in regards to a preference between single and twin. Competitors may point to the cost of a twin, but Airbus is touting potential cost-saving in the ability to “download” hours from from initial training in the fleet aircraft. The manufacturer argues that gaining initial experience in a twin-engine aircraft with a glass cockpit will save hours in a considerably more expensive to operate MH-60.

“What we’ve seen on Lakota with the U.S. Army and other places around the world is the benefit of training like you fight,” said Tumpak. “And the U.S. inventory, whether the Army or the Navy, the [fleet] aircraft are all twin engine, and it makes sense to have a twin-engine trainer.”

One of the Navy’s key requirements for the new trainer is that it must be instrument flight rules (IFR)-capable. This is an area where Airbus believes it has an advantage over Leonardo’s proposed TH-119 (based on the AW119), which is yet to receive IFR certification.

“We obviously have an extremely mature aircraft in terms of IFR with zero development,” said Tumpak.

The Navy has established the trainer replacement program, known officially as the Advanced Helicopter Training System (AHTS), as a “best value” competition.

The service will be using Conklin & de Decker as a reference for lifecycle costs for the competition, and according to Airbus, the H135 will be “far cheaper” than the AW119.

Responses to the RFP are due by April 2, and a rapid program progression will see a contract award in October or November 2019, with deliveries set to begin by September 2020.

The proposed production ramp up from there is aggressive, with 28 aircraft scheduled for delivery in fiscal year 2021, 36 per year for the following two years, and 30 in the fourth and final year of delivery.

Airbus believes the maturity of the H135 will position it well to meet that schedule with low risk.

“It’s quite a similar situation to when the Lakota program was started in 2006 and the first delivery happened six months after the contract, because we were postured with a mature product,” said Tumpak.

Airbus’s proposed trainer would be produced at its existing facility in Columbus, Mississippi, which is currently home to UH-72 Lakota production, and a civil H125 final assembly line for commercial deliveries in North America.

As Lakota production would still be continuing at the beginning of the Navy trainer ramp up, the workforce at the facility would need to be increased, but Airbus does see efficiencies in building its light twins in the same facility — as is the case for the civilian variants of the two types in Donauworth, Germany.

The manufacturer hopes its track record with the Lakota, which has seen it deliver more than 430 aircraft on time and at cost to the U.S. Army, will bolster its case with the Navy. It also hopes the Army’s use of the Lakota for initial entry rotary-wing training at Fort Rucker, Alabama, will prove the suitability of using a glass cockpit, twin-engine aircraft as a trainer.

The H135 is already serving as a primary trainer for several countries’ armed forces, including the U.K., Germany and Australia.

Airbus also sees potential for the Navy contract to be expanded — as happened with the Lakota program, which began with an initial requirement for 322 aircraft before expanding to over 460.

“We are sure that with the 135 we can make and provide the best platform to train the future students for the Navy,” said Martin Schneider, vice president, program director of H135 at Airbus. “We think with the past performance of the 135… we are very, very sure that this is not the end with the 130 orders.”"

Airbus announced on Thursday that it would end production of its A380 superjumbo jetliner, citing Emirates Airlines’ decision to reduce its A380 orderbook to 123 aircraft from 162 and a lack of demand with other air carriers. The Dubai-based airline operates the largest fleet of A380 aircraft.

“As a result of this decision we have no substantial A380 backlog and hence no basis to sustain production,” Airbus CEO Tom Enders said in a statement.

The last delivery of the jet is scheduled for 2021.

It’s been just more than a decade since the A380 first took to the skies, and it wasn’t exactly an easy takeoff. From the start, the aircraft was plagued by production delays and cost overruns, while airports were forced to upgrade their infrastructures – adjusting terminals, runways and taxiways – to accommodate the gigantic airplane. For comparison, the A380 seats more than 500 in a typical configuration (and can fit more than 800 maximum), while Boeing’s 747-800 seats a maximum of 467. The wingspan of the Airbus jet is about 40 feet longer than the 747-800.

Ending production of the A380 is likely to affect up to 3,500 jobs over the next three years and has cost the company more than $500 million in losses in 2018. Still, Airbus said it will continue to “fully support” the A380 operators.

“Today’s announcement is painful for us and the A380 communities worldwide,” Enders said. “But, keep in mind that A380s will still roam the skies for many years to come.”

Airlines are opting for more efficient, twin engine aircraft like Airbus’ A330neo and A350, and Boeing’s 777 and 787 Dreamliners, to serve long-haul routes. Many carriers worldwide have retired the 747, known as the “Queen of the Skies,” from passenger service and instead getting more use as a freight aircraft."

The Airbus A220 is now in service for Delta Air Lines.

Delta completed its first revenue flight on the jet Thursday morning with Delta Flight 744. It departed New York LaGuardia at 6 a.m. and landed in Boston 18 minutes ahead of schedule at 7:02 a.m.

Delta’s second A220-operated flight departed New York LaGuardia at 7:47 a.m. ET for Dallas/Fort Worth. In Texas, the first A220 departure from Dallas/Fort Worth was scheduled to depart at 8:05 a.m. ET (7:05 a.m. local time), bound for New York LaGuardia.

Delta becomes just the fifth airline in the world and the first in North America to fly passengers on the A220, which was previously known as the Bombardier CSeries until Airbus took a stake in the aircraft line.

Delta’s A220s seat 109 passengers, including 12 in first class and 15 in Delta’s extra-legroom “Comfort+” section.

The narrowbody planes seem a candidate to become a passenger favorite on the routes they’ll fly. Delta's A220s have large overhead bins and feature two-by-three seating in economy, meaning fewer middle seats. All of the plane's seats will be wider than the industry average. The planes have extra-large windows, including one in the lavatory.

Delta has ordered two versions of the jet, with the current, smaller version seating 109 passengers and the larger 130. Delta expects all 90 of the A220s it has ordered to be delivered by the end of 2023.

Delta is deploying the jets at several of its hubs, using them to fly to markets with high business demand. The passenger-friendly A220 could help give Delta a competitive advantage against rivals using older or more-cramped planes on competing routes.

The two routes beginning Thursday – Boston-LaGuardia and Dallas/Fort Worth-LaGuardia – are among the first routes Delta has targeted for its first A220 flights. Among the others that will soon get A220 flights are Detroit-Dallas/Fort Worth; LaGuardia-Houston Bush Intercontinental; Salt Lake City-Dallas/Fort Worth and New York JFK-Houston Bush Intercontinental.

Delta’s A220s had been expected to debut on Jan. 31, but that had to be pushed back after the federal shutdown delayed the Federal Aviation Administration certification needed to put the planes into passenger service.

Europe’s most state-of-the-art satellite and space technology centre begins operation

@AirbusSpace @CopernicusEU @ESA_EO @DLR #ITC #Friedrichshafen

Friedrichshafen, 22 February 2019 – Airbus’ Friedrichshafen site has opened Europe’s most state-of-the-art satellite integration and space technology centre, known as the Integrated Technology Centre (ITC). The ITC, which triples the area of clean room space to 4,200 m2, is dedicated to building satellites, probes, space instruments and experimental technologies. The centre took only two years to build at a total cost of approximately €45 million.

“Airbus’s significant investment in this building also represents an investment in the future – both for the Airbus site at Lake Constance and for Baden-Wuerttemberg as an aerospace location. When it comes to space technology, we are now a step ahead of the rest of Germany – in terms of science and research, development and technology, and enthusiasm for the aerospace industry,” said Baden-Wuerttemberg’s Minister-President, Winfried Kretschmann. “With this technology centre, Airbus has shown it has the courage to take the leap into a new age of even better satellites, and this includes those intended for scientific purposes. Satellites can, for instance, document changes in sea levels and detect even small sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Satellites of this nature are helping to expand the basic scientific knowledge needed to combat climate change.”

“Space flight has undergone huge positive development over the past few years. In addition to scientific missions to explore our solar system and investigate fundamental physical laws, we as a space company are meeting a swiftly increasing demand for high-performance, ultra-reliable Earth observation, meteorological and navigation satellites,” said Nicolas Chamussy, Head of Airbus Space Systems. “Thanks to the new satellite hub, production at Airbus’s Friedrichshafen site is optimally positioned in terms of both quality and quantity compared with our competitors.”

With dimensions of 70 x 60 metres and a ceiling height of up to 18.50 metres, the building was designed to expand the current satellite integration hall. The new ‘dual’ complex enables projects to be executed more efficiently and economically and, thanks to cutting-edge technology and its new size, also offers new possibilities for developing future space projects, such as large space telescopes.

The centrepiece of the ITC is its large clean room. The final integration of the satellites takes place under clean room conditions of various ‘cleanliness classes’ (from ISO 8 to ISO 5) in facilities totalling approximately 2,100 m2, of which 400 m2 are dedicated to ISO 5. Extensive air conditioning and filter systems circulate an air volume of 900,000 m3 up to 60 times an hour, which not only ensures the required levels of cleanliness but also a consistently elevated air pressure, in addition to controlling humidity and temperature.

Four seismic blocks, each weighing 150 tonnes, ‘decouple’ special integration tables from the building and ensure a completely vibration-free environment for the installation of optical instruments. A computer-controlled fan and filter matrix on the south side of the clean room generates air-flow profiles that can be adjusted to the occupancy of the room. This concept allows different clean room classes to be created in a single hall with no disruptive partitions or curtains.

In the adjacent check-out rooms, technicians can conduct a broad array of electrical function tests without having to enter the clean room area. All computer systems are housed in their own air-conditioned, noise-insulated racks.

The two wings of the ITC provide a further 1,100 m2 of integration and laboratory space for component manufacturing and technical areas. The first floor of the building’s west wing houses a conference zone and a multifunctional showroom and information space, whose large panoramic windows provide a unique view of the flight hardware production process.

Four Sentinel satellites for the European environment and security programme ‘Copernicus’, the joint European-Japanese EarthCARE Earth observation satellites and two 12.30-metre-long planar radar antennas are the first projects to move into the new centre. The integration work for JUICE, a mission to the icy moons of Jupiter (set to launch in 2022), is also expected to start within the next six months.

The piece by WSJ’s editorial board member Holman W. Jenkins, Jr. is entitled, “Airbus’s Lesson for Young Socialists, Its A380 debacle shows how hard it is for state planners to outguess markets.” His argument is really problematic, but probably not in the way one might at first guess.

For starters, the argument isn’t really about socialism versus capitalism at all but about private versus state capitalism. I don’t disagree with the writer’s base assertion that private companies outperform government in making such guesses. I think he just picked a lousy example.

Are you an aviation enthusiast or pilot? Sign up for our newsletter , full of tips, reviews and more!

First, a little background. The A380 is the largest passenger carrying aircraft ever with a capacity up to around 550 passengers on two levels in a typical configuration. It was conceived in the early 1990s as a competitor to the hugely successful Boeing 747, it was launched in the middle of that same decade and it entered service ten years later in 2006 after a series of predictable delays. Its development was subsidized by Germany, France and Britain to the tune of around $9 billion. Total development cost has been pegged at anywhere from $15 billion to $25 billion. The aircraft’s sales are, again, subsidized, albeit indirectly, by Gulf State airlines that are backed by their governments. The result is a marketplace for the A380 and for tickets to fly in it that’s dominated by Middle Eastern countries, which account for half of A380 deliveries. Those sales have been impressive in their own right—Airbus has delivered almost 250 of the half-billion-dollar behemoth, though none to North American operators. In fact, there are only a handful of airports in the United States the A380 can fly into, due to its size and special needs.

Back to the Journal. The assertion that the A380 should be an object lesson to young socialists is an odd one. One presumes that the A380 is a colossal failure when measured by the success of the Boeing 747. But it’s important to remember that the 747 was the result of a US Air Force program to develop a big air transport solution, a competition won by Lockheed with what would become the C-5 Galaxy. Boeing’s development costs for what would become the 747 were paid for only with the hope that the plane’s future would be wholly supported by direct government sales.

Like Airbus’s call on the A380, Boeing’s decision to launch the 747 was a wild ass guess that the market would be there for an airplane unlike any other that had ever been built. It turned out, there was such a market, though today, 50 years after its first flight, that market has dried up.

And it’s not because of anything about the 747. It is a far better airplane than the day it was launched, more efficient, more reliable and more economical to fly.

So why is the 747 going away? One word: ETOPS. Okay, that’s actually seven words crammed into a five-letter acronym. Regardless, ETOPS (Extended-range, Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards) is the rule that governs how far overwater a twin-engine plane can fly, and that distance, as you might not know, is pretty much as far as operators feel like going. Without going into great depth, the idea is that the plane needs to be able to fly somewhere and land if it loses one of its two engines, so it has to show it can do that and how it will do it. New twins from Boeing and Airbus are great at ETOPS. They can carry lots of (but not too many) passengers, and they can pull the whole thing off for much lower acquisition and operational costs that either the A380 or 747 can pull off.

So the demise of the Super Jumbo wasn’t a result of poor guesswork on the part of the state regarding the market for a plane. It was the result of everyone failing to see that twin-engine airplanes would be really good at flying from London to Sydney, etc. and would dominate the market for long routes.

There are probably better examples of socialist failures, regardless. First, you could go back a ways and look at the supersonic Concorde, one of the coolest airplanes ever, one that was heavily funded by the governments of France and the UK and which was unprofitable from the day it started flying until the day it was retired. But people love how forward thinking Concorde was, so they hate to bring that up. Or you could look at any number of projects Boeing has done for the government, like the V-22 Osprey, which is operationally really limited and not long for this world for a host of other reasons, on the least of which is the development of new technology that promises to obsolete the V-22 within the decade.

Am I sorry to see the A380 go away? (For the record, it will be around until about 2022). Not really. I am a huge fan of the Boeing 747, and I think the A380 is far more evolutionary than revolutionary and that its evolutions, like great size, are not necessarily smart ones.

But its demise is for the same reasons that the 747 is nearly out of orders and due to wrap up production around the same time as the A380. And those reasons are wholly unrelated to how either program got funded in the first place."
Airbus pulls plug on costly A380 superjumbo as sales plummet - Tech Xplore,"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHhwbG9yZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDE5LTAyLWFpcmJ1cy1jb3N0bHktYTM4MC1zdXBlcmp1bWJvLmh0bWzSAUVodHRwczovL3RlY2h4cGxvcmUuY29tL25ld3MvMjAxOS0wMi1haXJidXMtY29zdGx5LWEzODAtc3VwZXJqdW1iby5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airlines struggled to fill a plane capable of carrying anywhere from 500 to 850 people

European aerospace giant Airbus said Thursday that it would stop building its A380 superjumbo, the double-decker jet which earned plaudits from passengers but failed to win over enough airlines to justify its massive costs.

The final two double-deckers will be delivered in 2021, just 14 years after the first A380 went into service, after the Dubai-based Emirates decided to reduce its total orders by 39 planes, Airbus said.

It marks a disappointing end to a bold bet on how millions of people would travel in the future, as airlines struggled to fill a plane capable of carrying anywhere from 500 to 850 people.

""Without Emirates, Airbus has no substantial order backlog and no basis to sustain A380 production after 2021,"" Guillaume Faure, who is taking over as Airbus CEO from Tom Enders this spring, said in a conference call.

Airbus had at one point chalked up over 320 orders for the superjumbo, which has a list price of $446 million—though the company often had to offer substantial discounts.

Analysts had warned that Airbus wouldn't start to recover the roughly 25 billion euros in investment and production costs unless at least 400 planes were sold, and possibly up to 600.

Airbus itself never disclosed how many planes it needed to sell to break even, a growing concern among analysts as technical problems and delivery delays piled up.

The Airbus A380 is capable of carrying anywhere from 500 to 850 people

With the reduced orders from Emirates, the A380's biggest client, Airbus said its order book now stood at just 274 planes.

'Sad day'

The A380's demise is a stark admission of defeat in the race against US rival Boeing, which had pointedly dismissed Airbus's bet that airlines wanted huge transporters serving a handful of global hubs.

Most airlines are instead using traditional—and less costly—jets to offer more direct flights between more cities.

Airbus had already warned last year that the A380 programme could be scrapped if no new orders came in.

It later received a lifeline when Emirates ordered 36 more A380s, but on Thursday Airbus said the airline had balked and would buy smaller A330 and A350 models instead.

After just 10 deliveries last year, Airbus will build eight this year, seven in 2020 and the final two in 2021.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel christens an Airbus A380 aircraft in 2015

""The A380 is a world-class feat of engineering, much loved by passengers, and we are obviously saddened that deliveries will come to an end,"" said Chris Cholerton, head of civil aerospace at Rolls-Royce, one of the A380's engine suppliers.

Airbus workers in Britain, where the plane's wings are manufactured, and in France where the jet is assembled, also expressed regret over the programme's demise.

The plane-maker has promised that the 3,000-3,500 workers employed on the superjumbo will be moved to other projects.

But Rhys McCarthy of Britain's Unite union said it was nonetheless ""a sad day"" for its UK employees.

""It is a much-loved aircraft manufactured by a highly skilled workforce,"" he said.

Jean-François Knepper of France's Force Ouvriere union said that although rumours that the programme was set to be scrapped had been swirling at the assembly plant it Toulouse ""everyone was hoping for a miracle"".

Winding up the programme cut Airbus's 2018 earnings by 463 million euros, but it still posted a 29 percent surge in net profit to three billion euros.

Airbus CEO Tom Enders, who is stepping down in the spring

Airbus said it expects to deliver 880 to 890 planes this year after 800 last year, reflecting steady demand for the A320, the workhorse midsize jet for short and medium-range flights.

It is also targeting more clients for its long-haul A350.

Turbulent history

Airbus had faced scepticism over the plane's prospects since the 1990s, when it began to envision a competitor to Boeing's hugely successful 747.

Initial orders however were solid, especially among Asian and Middle East airlines operating several busy long-haul routes.

And passengers raved at a noticeably quieter cabin with decent legroom even in economy class—most airlines configured the plane for 500 to 550 passengers, instead of the all-economy potential for 850 seats.

But Airbus suffered a series of costly delays before the A380's first commercial flight by Singapore Airlines in 2007.

The end of the A380 marks an ignominious end to a bold bet on how millions of people would travel in the future

Production problems, including extensive wiring issues, and cost overruns in the billions of euros continued to plague the project, forcing Airbus to report its first-ever annual loss for the 2006 financial year.

Airbus stood by the A380 even after it was slammed by the global financial crisis of 2008, when airlines started having second thoughts about owning huge planes that were profitable only when filled to the brim.

Pledges to get the A380 programme back on track were not enough to avoid further delays, even as a series of safety scares raised questions among potential clients, including long-targeted Chinese airlines.

""It is an extremely complex aircraft,"" Enders admitted to German magazine Der Spiegel in 2009.

Airbus to stop production of A380 - Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette,"Fri, 15 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDE5L2ZlYi8xNS9haXJidXMtdG8tc3RvcC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLW9mLWEzODAtMjAxOTAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TOULOUSE, France -- Airbus will cease production of its mammoth A380 passenger jet, an engineering marvel that nevertheless couldn't keep up with shifts in the way people fly, the European aircraft-maker said Thursday.

Citing reduced orders from Emirates Airline, a major customer, and an inability to find other buyers, the company said it would halt deliveries of the jumbo jetliner in 2021, although it said it would continue to support existing A380s.

""As a result of this decision we have no substantial A380 backlog and hence no basis to sustain production, despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years,"" the company's chief executive, Tom Enders, said in a statement. ""Today's announcement is painful for us and the A380 communities worldwide.""

The decision will lead to job cuts at Airbus, potentially affecting as many as 3,500 of its 134,000 employees over the next three years. Airbus said it would start discussions in the next few weeks about the consequences for its workforce.

The announcement overshadowed the company's announcement on Thursday of its full-year results. Its net income rose 29 percent in 2018 to about $3.5 billion.

Development talks for the plane began in 2000, meant to be Airbus' 21st-century answer to rival Boeing's 1960s-era 747, and one of the most ambitious endeavors in aviation. Its four Rolls-Royce engines were quieter than ever, far out on the extra-long wings. Carbon-fiber technology was used for the body to make it lighter and easier to maneuver. Its double-decker construction allowed room for bars, duty-free shops and even showers.

From its inception, the A380 was a grand European project. The wings, like those of all Airbus aircraft, came from the U.K., and components were ferried across the continent from production sites in Germany and France. The giant fuselage tubes were taken by barge and flatbed truck to the main facility in Toulouse, and the planes were then painted and kitted out in Hamburg. Teams from across the region joined colleagues at other sites during crunch times, the bulbous Beluga freight planes would crisscross countries with parts, and the A380 was a popular backdrop at air shows for politicians celebrating Europe's achievements.

Airbus spent $25 billion developing the aircraft, which can carry more than 500 passengers. It was built for a time when crowded airports would demand that planes carry more people to reduce congestion.

But flight traffic instead shifted to smaller planes, which are cheaper to maintain, flying to regional airports, a move that reduced demand for larger aircraft.

Emirates, the Dubai-based airline, was Airbus' main customer for the jumbo jet, with a fleet of more than 100, but the airline has scaled back its plans and will take delivery of just 14 more over the next two years.

One of the jetliner's first test pilots took a philosophical view. While he's ""feeling a bit sad"" about the news, Claude Lelaie said the giant plane will be remembered for pushing the barriers of aviation, like the supersonic Concorde.

""Both made history and allowed progress, technological progress,"" he told The Associated Press from the southern French city of Toulouse, the cradle of Airbus' worldwide operations. ""That's business -- you have to ensure the success of the company.""

Lelaie was a co-pilot aboard the maiden flight of the superjumbo in 2005, 101 years after the Wright brothers' first flight.

Yet to detractors, the A380 smacked of hubris, a vanity project by managers who saw bigger as better despite an uncertain market for a plane so huge that airports had to modify their runways and gates.

It faced repeated production setbacks and cost overruns. Order cancellations led to a restructuring at Airbus that saw thousands of job cuts.

""The 380 may have just been too large of a step for the market to handle,"" said Rob Watts, CEO of aviation consulting company Aerotask.

The chairman and CEO of Emirates, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al Maktoum, said: ""While we are disappointed to have to give up our order, and sad that the program could not be sustained, we accept that this is the reality of the situation.""

The fate of the superjumbo has been in question for at least a year, and Enders acknowledged in January 2018 that the company would not be able to continue production of the plane without an order from Emirates.

Airbus was thrown a lifeline with a $16 billion order from Emirates a few days later, but Airbus confirmed last month that it was in discussions about whether that deal would ever be realized. The A380 took another hit last week as Qantas canceled its order from 2006 for eight of the planes.

Emirates is not abandoning Airbus, however. The plane manufacturer said Thursday that the airline would emphasize two smaller models instead, the A330-900 and the A350-900.

Airbus was at pains to emphasize that A380s will not disappear anytime soon. ""Keep in mind that A380s will still roam the skies for many years to come, and Airbus will of course continue to fully support the A380 operators,"" Enders said.

On Thursday, the Airbus A220 jetliner official entered commercial service in North America with Delta Air Lines.

Delta's relationship with the A220, formerly known as the Bombardier C Series, started in 2016 when the carrier announced an order for 75 of the jetliners in a deal worth as much as $5.6 billion. The order made Delta the plane's North American launch customer.

In April 2017, Boeing filed a complaint with US Commerce Department and the US International Trade Commission alleging that the Delta C Series order was made possible only by abnormally low prices supported by Canadian government subsidies.

The US International Trade Commission agreed and in September of that year recommended a 219.63% tariff. A week later, the Commerce Department added a 79.82% tariff.

Bombardier and Delta both argued that Boeing's business couldn't have been hurt by the deal because Boeing didn't have a product in its lineup similar in capacity to the C Series.

In total, Bombardier and Delta faced a 299.45% tariff on any Canadian-built C Series plane exported to the US.

Facing the possibility of losing the most important order in the C Series program's history, Bombardier turned to Boeing's greatest foe, Airbus.

Less than a month after the tariff was announced, Bombardier handed 50.01% of its prized airliner program to Airbus with zero up-front cash investment coming from the European aviation giant.

In the summer of 2018, the Bombardier C Series was officially rebranded as the Airbus A220.

So what's all the fuss about?

The A220 is a state-of-the-art single-aisle airliner. The Canadian-built jet is a clean-sheet design that incorporates the latest in commercial aviation technology, like a carbon-composite fuselage and fuel-sipping Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engines.

The plane, which entered service with Swiss in 2016, has earned praise from its operators for its exceptional fuel efficiency.

The A220 lives in the 100-to-150-seat airliner market, a segment that Airbus and Boeing had effectively abandoned for a decade.

So nearly three years, a trade dispute, and a name change later, the jet is finally ready to fly with Delta Air Lines.

Here's a closer look at the inaugural flight of Delta's Airbus A220."
A380 cancellations by Qantas raise new questions about the superjumbo's future - CNN,"Thu, 07 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAxOS8wMi8wNy9idXNpbmVzcy9xYW50YXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBPmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMTkvMDIvMDcvYnVzaW5lc3MvcWFudGFzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hong Kong CNN Business —

Doubts about the future of the Airbus A380 have grown after yet another airline canceled an order for the superjumbo jet.

Australia’s Qantas (QABSY) said Thursday that it had scrapped longstanding plans to buy eight more of the double-decker planes.

The A380 has been a major disappointment for Airbus (EADSF), racking up less than a quarter of the sales the European company forecast when it first introduced the giant jetliner more than a decade ago. The underwhelming demand has fueled questions about how long the manufacturer can justify continuing production of the iconic aircraft.

Airlines like Qantas have shifted their interest to lighter, more fuel efficient passenger jets.

“For Qantas, the A380 is the aircraft of the past and not its future,” said Ellis Taylor, Asia finance editor at aviation intelligence firm FlightGlobal.

Other airlines including Virgin Atlantic have ditched plans to buy the aircraft in the past year. Airbus now has only 79 firm orders for it, according to FlightGlobal data.

The program’s future could hinge on Dubai-based Emirates, the largest A380 operator with more than 100 of the aircraft in service. The Gulf carrier last year ordered a further 20 of the superjumbo jets, with the option to buy an additional 16 on top of that.

But Airbus said last month that it was renegotiating the deal with Emirates following reports that the airline was looking to switch its orders to the smaller and newer A350.

“Emirates switching all of its order would certainly be the death knell for the A380,” Taylor said.

Other potential customers for the aircraft include British Airways and Japan’s All Nippon Airways, but neither airline has committed to adding more A380s to its fleet.

“That makes it hard to see where more sales will come from in the near term,” said Taylor.

An Airbus spokesman on Thursday confirmed that Qantas had changed its order but didn’t comment on what it meant for the A380’s future.

Qantas said it’s in the process of upgrading its 12 existing A380s and planned to “operate the aircraft well into the future.”"

On Thursday, Airbus announced that production of its flagship A380 superjumbo airliner would end in 2021. The European aviation giant made the decision after Emirates, the aircraft's most loyal customer, decided to reduce its A380 order to 123 planes from 162.

""As a result of this decision we have no substantial A380 backlog and hence no basis to sustain production, despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years,"" Airbus CEO Tom Enders said in a statement. ""This leads to the end of A380 deliveries in 2021.""

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Even though the A380 proved to be immensely popular with travelers, its size and expense made the plane persona non grata with airlines.

""The market wasn't there, and I never understood why they launched it,"" longtime aviation-industry analyst Richard Aboulafia said in an interview with Business Insider. ""Big is not good.""

""If you're looking for international long-haul aircraft, you want 250 to 300 seats,"" he added. ""That's what the markets want, and there doesn't appear to be a lot of deviation from that.""

The A380 usually flies with 470 to 600 seats.

The latest tally from Airbus shows that it has delivered 234 A380s to customers, including 109 to Emirates.

Aboulafia, the vice president of analysis at Teal Group, said there were only 17 undelivered A380s left before Airbus would shudder its production line in 2021. Of those, 14 are designated for Emirates and three for Japan's All Nippon Airways.

The analyst says Airbus made the right call to bring the A380 program to an end.

""Rip off the Band-Aid — it feels better that way,"" he said. ""With this out of the way, they can take advantage of all of the other market segments with their far more important products.""

Specifically, the end of the $25 billion A380 program allows Airbus to concentrate its time and resources on other more lucrative segments of the market like its hot-selling single-aisle A320neo family of jets or a clean-sheet middle-of-the-market aircraft to bridge the gap between its large single-aisle jets and its smaller twin-aisle offerings.

The A380's loss is the A330neo's gain

One of the positives to come from the end of the A380 is the shot in the arm Emirates gave to the underperforming A330neo program.

The Dubai, United Arab Emirates-based airline announced an order for 40 A330neos, an updated version of the popular A330ceo airliner.

Sales have been hard to come by for the A330neo, with several potential suitors opting for the rival Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Apart from Delta, AirAsia, and TAP Portugal, few major airlines have gone for the plane. Last year, Hawaiian Airlines canceled its A330neo order in favor of the Dreamliner. One of the reasons cited by Hawaiian's CEO was the lack of market acceptance for the Airbus.

The A330neo's reputation is certainly bolstered by the addition of Emirates to its customer base. ""It helps a lot,"" Aboulafia said.

Does the end of the A380 program mean Airbus is out of the business of big twin-aisle jets? For now, yes.

""Right now, no one wants a bigger twin-aisle, but in a few years, they aren't going to want to cede the market to the Boeing 777-9X,"" Aboulafia said. ""They'll do a growth version of the A350-1000.""

The Boeing 777-9X is expected to enter service in 2020. With the discontinuation of the A380 in 2021, the 777-9X is set to be the largest passenger plane in production."
Boeing's 777X Will Benefit From the Airbus A380's Demise - The Motley Fool,"Mon, 18 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDE5LzAyLzE4L2JvZWluZy03Nzd4LXdpbGwtYmVuZWZpdC1mcm9tLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLWRlbWlzZS5hc3B40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus will stop building the A380 jumbo jet in 2021 -- which should boost demand for Boeing's new 777X aircraft family.

Last week, Airbus (EADSY -1.16%) announced that it will wind down production of its A380 jumbo jet by 2021, confirming recent media reports. Airbus' vision of rising airport congestion forcing airlines to adopt ever larger airplanes was undermined by the growing popularity of small widebodies, such as Boeing's (BA -1.95%) 787 Dreamliner, which have enabled airlines to operate more point-to-point routes that bypass the most congested hubs.

That said, there is still a market for large widebody aircraft -- particularly if they can offer a unit cost advantage over their smaller brethren. Boeing's new 777X aircraft family is set to dominate this market in the coming years, capitalizing on the failure of Airbus' A380.

An overlapping customer base

The Boeing 777X is an updated version of Boeing's highly successful 777 aircraft family that will enter service next year. It promises to offer additional range and better fuel efficiency, thanks to a new wing and state-of-the-art engines. The smaller 777-8 model is roughly similar in size to the current 777-300ER model, as well as Airbus' competing A350-1000. Meanwhile, the larger and more popular 777-9 version is the largest twin-engine plane on the market and has no direct competitors.

Like the A380, the 777-9 will enable airlines to expand at congested airports where it's not practical to add lots of new flights. But the 777-9 should have significantly lower unit costs than the A380, while also being easier to fill, on account of being smaller.

Check out the latest Boeing earnings call transcript.

Given that the two planes are designed to perform similar missions, it's not surprising that there is a huge amount of customer overlap between the A380 and 777X. Of the roughly 250 A380s that Airbus will ultimately deliver, Emirates will have taken 123. Its two regional rivals -- Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways -- along with Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa together account for another 58 deliveries.

These same five airlines account for 275 of the 326 firm orders in Boeing's 777X backlog. As with the A380, Emirates is the dominant customer for the 777X, with 150 firm orders.

Unsteady demand for the 777X

While demand for A380s has fallen off a cliff in recent years, the 777X hasn't been much more popular. The proliferation of low-cost long-haul airlines has held down fares for international travel, making most airlines wary of committing to ambitious growth plans. As a result, Boeing has received only one significant order for the 777X since the beginning of 2015: a 20-plane deal with Singapore Airlines signed two years ago.

Meanwhile, falling oil prices, cutthroat competition for connecting traffic, and pockets of weakness in the global economy have pressured results at Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Etihad in recent years. This situation has made it clear that they need to radically scale back their ambitious growth plan, calling into question whether they need as many 777Xs as they have ordered.

The death of the A380 is a huge tailwind

Fortunately for Boeing, the end of A380 production could lead to a wave of 777X orders in the coming years. Emirates is already contemplating ordering at least 20 more 777Xs, according to Bloomberg, despite having 150 on order.

Emirates doesn't need to grow at a breakneck pace to justify an expanded 777X order book. The carrier currently has about 250 777-300ERs and A380s in its fleet, and the 777X is likely to be the airline's main replacement for both models. Emirates tends to retire its planes at a younger age than most airlines, so it will probably replace the vast majority of its current fleet by 2030.

Similarly, Singapore Airlines has already retired its oldest A380s, and Qatar Airways recently confirmed that it only expects to keep its A380s for a total of 10 years. As more airlines retire their A380s, maintenance costs are likely to rise, encouraging other major operators like Qantas to follow suit.

Boeing could still see some 777X order cancellations by Etihad Airways, which is dramatically restructuring its business. But on the flip side, it has a legitimate shot at snaring new orders from Qantas, Turkish Airlines, and some of the big airlines in East Asia.

In recent years, airlines have shown a clear preference for the smaller Boeing 787 and A350 families over the largest widebody jets. Nevertheless, with the A380 out of the picture, Boeing's 777X should be able to carve out a profitable niche for itself."
"Business Class Flight Review: Emirates, Airbus A380, Dubai to New York - Business Insider","Thu, 21 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MtY2xhc3MtZmxpZ2h0LXJldmlldy1lbWlyYXRlcy1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1kdWJhaS10by1uZXcteW9yay0yMDE5LTLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What did I think about business class on Emirates' Airbus A380? If it wasn't already clear from the previous 186 slides, I was enamored.

Harrison Jacobs/Business Insider

Though I had a solid experience on Emirates' economy class on the A380 several months ago, it was clear from the moment I booked the business-class ticket that the airline's luxury services are its specialty.

There were little (and big) touches that made me feel taken care throughout my trip.

The complimentary chauffeur service meant I didn't have to think about how I was getting to the airport or home. The separate airport entrance and security check-in at Dubai International Airport made getting to my flight a breeze.

It would be impossible to talk about flying in Emirates' business class without talking about the lounge experience. In the past year, I've visited dozens of business-class lounges thanks to my Priority Pass membership. The Emirates lounge at DXB was way better.

As far as the flight, I don't have a point of comparison because I'd never flown in business class before, though I'd seen business-class cabins countless times as I walked to my economy seat.

The Emirates' A380 business class seemed on a different level than business class on most other airlines. Rather than taking up a small part of the front of the plane, business class takes up an entire floor on the A380. And rather than having slightly roomier seats, Emirates has pods for each person, with a seat that turns into a bed, that feels secluded.

I can see why aviation junkies are so hyped on the A380. It feels huge, particularly in business class. I never felt as if I was going to bump into another passenger. There was tons of room to stretch out and walk around.

Ultimately, the best parts of the flight for me were the lounge area and the staff.

The flight attendants were exceptionally cheery and always willing to help. Many times they came around to offer things I didn't even know I wanted. More than that, though, they were personable. They took the time to chat with passengers and get to know them. It made the flight fun in a way I'd never experienced before. That's obviously not possible when attendants are serving 300 passengers in economy, but that's a benefit of having business class on a separate floor: There's a staff serving only those passengers.

I'd expected the lounge/bar area to be a gimmick that no one really used. But throughout the flight, there were always a few passengers there chatting or, more often, talking with the staff. An open social place creates a totally different atmosphere. I have to think it makes for happier staff members as well. I hadn't planned on hanging out in the lounge — it was a flight in the middle of the night, after all — and I ended up spending two or three hours there. That speaks volumes.

Whether I fly in business class again will come down to price. A long-haul nonstop business-class Emirates flight is likely to run $5,000 or more. That's far more than I like to spend on airfare. But for the business travelers or wealthy travelers Emirates is targeting, the price most likely doesn't matter.

If you're an aviation geek, flying the A380 in business class is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. With the demise of the hub-and-spoke airline strategy, the A380 is most likely the last superjumbo of its kind. My advice? Don't miss it before it's gone forever."

Airbus scraps production of A380 superjumbo - DW (English),"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3LmNvbS9lbi9haXJidXMtc2NyYXBzLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tb2YtYTM4MC1zdXBlcmp1bWJvL2EtNDc1MTEwMjbSAUxodHRwczovL2FtcC5kdy5jb20vZW4vYWlyYnVzLXNjcmFwcy1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLW9mLWEzODAtc3VwZXJqdW1iby9hLTQ3NTExMDI2?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European aviation giant Airbus says it will stop making its superjumbo A380 in 2021 after struggling to sell the world's biggest passenger jet. Thousands of jobs in Germany and France are at stake.

European aircraft manufacturer Airbus on Thursday announced it will end production of the A380 double-decker passenger jet by 2021.

The Franco-German company had hoped the superjumbo would challenge Boeing's 747 and revolutionize air travel in the 21st century.

""Without Emirates, Airbus has no substantial order backlog and no basis to sustain A380 production after 2021,"" said Guillaume Faure, who is taking over as Airbus CEO from Tom Enders this spring.

The annoucement was made alongside the news that Airbus net profit had risen 29 percent in 2018 after strong demand for its smaller planes. Airbus managed to make these profits despite 899 million euros ($1 billion) in losses from the A380 aircraft.

The company's stocks fared well in trading later on Thursday, rising 4.5 percent with investors apparently relieved by the decision to cut the cord on a losing venture.

What the company said:

Key client Emirates had informed Airbus it was cutting orders from 162 to 123 aircraft

That left the company with no substantial A380 backlog and no basis to sustain production

Shutdown costs are estimated at €463 million ($521 million) with a billion euros of European government loans forgiven

It will still produce 17 A380s including 14 for Emirates and 3 for Japanese airline ANA

CEO Enders said talks with trade unions about any potential impact on jobs would follow in the coming weeks

Emirates disappointed

The Dubai-based Emirates airline is the biggest A380 customerand built its global brand around the model. The A380 will remain a central part of the Emirates fleet into the 2030s, the airline said.

""Emirates has been a staunch supporter of the A380 since its inception,"" said Emirates Chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum. ""While we are disappointed to have to give up our order, and sad that the program could not be sustained, we accept that this is the reality of the situation."" Emirates has ordered 40 A330-900neo jets and 30 A350-900 aircraft instead.

Airbus CEO Tom Enders called the superjumbo an ""outstanding technical and industrial achievement,"" adding that the announcement was ""painful for us and A380 communities around the world.""

What was the problem with the A380? The world's biggest passenger jet started flying in 2008. With two decks of cabins and room for 544 people in standard layout, airlines were reluctant to commit to the costly plane and airports had to build new runways and modify terminals to accommodate it. The project suffered production delays and cost overruns right from the outset. The company was forced to restructure, costing thousands of jobs.

Enders said Airbus would continue to support the A380 for as long as it remains in service.

What effect will it have on earnings? Despite losses of €899 million ($1 billion) on the A380, Airbus on Thursday announced a 29 percent rise in profits for 2018. Net profit increased from €2.4 billion to €3.1 billion.

Airbus will book a €463 million in shutdown costs but expects to be forgiven a billion euros of outstanding European government loans under a funding system which has been central to its trade dispute with its US rival Boeing.

Overall, Airbus expects to deliver 880 to 890 planes this year after 800 last year, with steady demand for the midsize A320 which carries out short and medium-range flights.

What happens next? Airbus said it would start talks in the coming weeks with unions over the 3,500 jobs that could be at risk.
