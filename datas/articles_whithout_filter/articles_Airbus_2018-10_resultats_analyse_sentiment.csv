Airbus demonstrates manned-unmanned teaming for future air combat systems - Airbus,"Tue, 02 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE4LTEwLWFpcmJ1cy1kZW1vbnN0cmF0ZXMtbWFubmVkLXVubWFubmVkLXRlYW1pbmctZm9yLWZ1dHVyZS1haXItY29tYmF0LXN5c3RlbXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This unprecedented achievement for Europe is part of Airbus’ future air power vision

The ability to control unmanned systems from a manned aircraft is an important “force multiplier” in Airbus’ vision for future air power that is smart, modular and connected. This know-how has been confirmed in a dynamic and interactive way during manned-unmanned teaming (MUT) test flight campaigns successfully performed by the company.

These campaigns included demonstrations with five Airbus-built Do-DT25 target drones controlled from a mission group commander who was airborne in a manned command and control (C2) aircraft.

Flown in a test zone of Germany’s Baltic Sea area, the MUT trial flights served multiple purposes, including validating such elements as connectivity, human-machine interface, and the concept of teaming intelligence through mission group management. For the aspect of teaming intelligence, multiple capabilities and enabling technologies are required at sufficient maturity levels – from teaming/swarming algorithms and new sensors to mission management systems for command and control assistance by the manned aircraft’s crew.

Advanced flight control and flight management system

A key element contributing to these successful flights was the advanced flight control and flight management system developed by Airbus for unmanned air vehicles – which combines fully automatic guidance, navigation and control with intelligent swarming capabilities.

Manned-unmanned-teaming is expected to increase the mission efficiency of future airborne systems in many ways. Equipped with sensors, the swarm of unmanned systems can provide situational awareness to a mission group commander located a safe distance away aboard the manned aircraft.

The Airbus MUT demonstrations brought together several of the company’s programme and product lines, with the main development and test phases conducted during a short timeframe and at low cost – supported by an agile, rapid prototyping environment and a risk-mitigation approach.

Expertise gained during the manned-unmanned teaming test flight campaigns will be applied by Airbus to develop Europe’s Future Combat Air System (FCAS).

Airbus’ manned-unmanned teaming (MUT) test flight campaigns were successful.

Airbus has a new CEO.

Airbus has named French engineer Guillaume Faury as its next CEO. Managing the potential fallout from Brexit will be his first challenge, but there are plenty of others too.

Faury will replace Tom Enders on April 10, 2019, the European airplane maker said Monday. His appointment answers one key question raised by a leadership shuffle announced late last year.

Before taking charge of Airbus’ Commercial Aircraft division in February 2018, Faury led the company’s helicopter business. He also did turns as a senior manager at Peugeot and Eurocopter.

Airbus (EADSF) has had a strong run this year, with its stock up 25% since January. But the company is facing challenges that will require the licensed flight test engineer to quickly get up to speed.

Deliveries

Airbus secured 1,109 aircraft orders in 2017, nearly 200 more than Boeing.

It now has nearly 7,400 aircraft orders pending, making the timely delivery of planes a top priority.

Problems with faulty Pratt & Whitney engines took Airbus planes out of service earlier this year and delayed engine production. Deliveries of the narrow-body A320neo slowed as a result.

Avoiding future delays will be key for the new CEO.

Tariffs and Brexit

Airbus has a complicated supply chain spanning several continents, which makes it vulnerable to escalating global trade tensions.

One big danger is Brexit. Airbus is headquartered in Toulouse, France, but it has roughly 15,000 employees and significant productions facilities in the United Kingdom.

If Britain crashes out of the European Union on March 29, 2019 without a deal on trading arrangements, Airbus has said the outcome would be “catastrophic” and threaten its future in the country.

Even an orderly Brexit could add some unwanted friction to its supply chain.

Stability at the top

Faury is taking over during a time of major management upheaval at Airbus.

Legendary sales chief John Leahy retired earlier this year, but the executive appointed to succeed him has already left the company. Christian Scherer was appointed to the job just last month, and Faury will need to ensure he sticks around.

Several other top mangers have departed Airbus, including former planemaking chief Fabrice Brégier. Longtime CFO Harald Wilhelm will leave the company in 2019.

Chinese competition

Way off in the distance, Airbus is likely to come under pressure from one of its best customers: China.

China’s first direct competitor to Boeing (BA) and Airbus’ dominant single-aisle jets, the Comac C919, made its first test flight in May 2017.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.7263241410255432}",negative,0.7263241410255432,-1
Airbus and Georgia Tech Open Center for Overall Aircraft Design - Airbus,"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0xMC1haXJidXMtYW5kLWdlb3JnaWEtdGVjaC1vcGVuLWNlbnRlci1mb3Itb3ZlcmFsbC1haXJjcmFmdC1kZXNpZ27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Both will take advantage of this strategic collaboration to accelerate the transformation of the aircraft design process.

Last week Airbus and Georgia Institute of Technology officially opened the Airbus / Georgia Tech Center for Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)- enabled Overall Aircraft Design (OAD).

This Center will contribute to the development and demonstration of a concurrent overall aircraft design process – taking full advantage of MBSE, interactive, parametric design space exploration and digital enablers with a team of 30 Georgia Tech researchers, doctoral students and Airbus experts.

The opening ceremony was attended by Dr. Marc Fischer, Senior Vice President Flight Physics at Airbus; Amanda Simpson, Vice President of Research and Technology for Airbus Americas; and Dr. Mark Costello, chair of Georgia Tech’s Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering.

“We are proud to take the partnership with Georgia Tech to the next level,” said Fischer. “Our future aircraft developments will benefit from much more integrated and interdisciplinary processes. Model Based Systems Engineering is at the foundation of this ambition and allows us to cover not just the conventional OAD disciplines, but also trade opportunities between engineering and manufacturing. This partnership aims to build a much larger ecosystem within and beyond Airbus, bringing our European and international partners on board.”

""This collaboration between Airbus and our Aerospace Systems Design Lab provides a unique opportunity for our students and faculty to work on research projects that are defining the next generation aircraft,” Costello said. “Model-based Systems Engineering is a specific strength of the Aerospace Engineering School, and this collaboration with Airbus will enable us to help develop the next generation of aircraft design thinking.""

The collaboration has moved from a framing and ideation phase into project mode - delivering along a multi-year roadmap. Beyond contractual research work in the traditional sense, Airbus and Georgia Tech have engaged in a truly collaborative effort, where industrial experience and state-of-the-art research are combined.

“This Center is further demonstration of the value our American education institutions contribute to our entire global enterprise,” said Simpson.

Fully automated reliability reporting, saving airlines hours per week

Airbus has presented its new reliability analysis software at MRO Europe 2018. Called “Skywise Reliability,” this new solution has been developed by Airbus and is offered with Skywise Core. The application integrates all relevant fleet-wide data – such as part replacements, flight plans and delays and historical maintenance actions – and fully automates reliability reporting, saving airlines hours per week. Furthermore, it allows users to ‘drill down’ into trends to truly diagnose root causes so they can allocate resources to mitigate recurring operational interruptions (OIs).

Skywise Reliability also complements internal data with worldwide anonymised fleet data so that airlines can proactively assess reliability performance against industry benchmarks and understand whether a recurring issue is unique or a more systematic issue. Thanks to Skywise Reliability, airlines have already reported that they can typically reduce the reliability process time from one week to one day – saving significant time in collecting/sorting/processing the data and producing reports.

Since its launch in June 2018, 28 airlines have been connected to Skywise Reliability, including easyJet, Allegiant, WOW Air, Bangkok Airways, and Etihad. The service provides interactive and ready-to-use dashboards to simplify the reliability process and increase its efficiency. It allows users to measure in-service fleet performance, explore operational data and benchmark fleet data (eg. fleet utilisation, operational interruptions and in-service issues, LRU removals, logbook data etc.) with other operators and the worldwide Airbus fleet.

Thanks to Skywise Reliability, airline engineers and technicians can easily set up alerts (for example on mean time between unscheduled removal (MTBUR) of a line-replaceable unit (LRU) versus guaranteed MTBUR), and analyse trends, build reliability reports and collaborate.

Airbus put a spotlight on the top-performing companies in its supply chain at this week’s Global Supplier Conference, recognizing “best-in-class” operations in three key categories: “Industrial Performance,” “Customer Support” and “Innovation.”

The company works with over 12,000 partners and suppliers across the globe. More than 350 were in attendance at the Global Supplier Conference – held 24-25 October in the Canadian city of Montreal – which provided the opportunity to meet Airbus executives for exchanges on strategy, mutual business challenges and opportunities.

Holding this year’s edition of the annual event in Canada is particularly symbolic, coming just months after Airbus introduced the state-of-the-art, Canadian-produced A220 Family into its jetliner product line. Airbus now manufactures, markets and supports the A220-100 and A220-300 – both designed for the 100-150 seat airliner segment – under the aegis of its partnership with Bombardier.

And the winners are…

For the “Industrial Performance” category, a top award went to Liebherr Aerospace Toulouse in recognition of its impressive 99.64% reliability rate, as well as the company’s support on the early-adopter initiative for Airbus’ “Skywise for Suppliers” aviation data platform.

In the same category, Aleris received an award for outstanding quality performance, as well as the company’s contribution to the qualification of new wing skins on Airbus single-aisle jetliners; while Electroimpact earned an award for its exceptional, proactive industrial performance during production ramp-up.

The “Customer Support” award was attributed to Safran Electrical & Power, which received the best rated score by the airlines for consistent customer services.

In the “Innovation” category, Diehl Aviation was honoured for its new galley air chiller with customisable cooling speed and temperature, which will bring weight, cost and reliability benefits to Airbus aircraft.

Also receiving an “Innovation” award was Spirit Aerosystems which designed and manufactured a solution for new spoilers used on the wings of Airbus single-aisle aircraft by applying resin transfer moulding (RTM) in a highly automated factory – resulting in both weight and recurring cost reductions.

MTM Robotics was given an award for the development of a lightweight drilling robot structure for aircraft skins, which will improve the quality and performance of automatic drilling.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999995231628418}",positive,0.9999995231628418,1

Despite the potential upside there are dangers for companies outsourcing their data analytics function to third parties. In many cases, such as the Airbus example, there are benefits to pooling data and using the expertise of companies operating data processing platforms. Where strict rules are enforced as to who owns the data once it has been processed, who else can see the results and what happens to it once the processing has taken place many problems can be avoided.

As consultants McKinsey recently demonstrated, however, data is reshaping value chains across a number of industries. Many functions of the firm can be outsourced to those with core expertise in delivering on those activities. The danger for companies, according to McKinsey, is that data may be their most valuable asset and entrusting it to others could be a costly mistake. In industrial settings this might take place where the data generated by your plant machinery is collected and owned by the equipment manufacturer.

It is also important to avoid being locked in to a single platform where switching to a new provider can be difficult and costly. The recent announcement that the EU is investigating Amazon for the way it uses data from third parties selling on its platform is a case in point. The claim is that Amazon may be using its overview of all sales data to potentially create and sell its own products to compete with its own customers.

Enriching the customer experience with data

Business value chains are being transformed through the massive collection and processing of data across a range of business processes. At the same time consumer expectations are rising with expectations of low prices, fast delivery and massive choice combined with personalized service. Recent research from CRM vendor Salesforce of 6,700 consumers and business buyers illustrates the challenges faced by companies as they try to navigate this new landscape.

According to Salesforce, 72% of consumers and 89% of business buyers say they “expect companies to understand their unique needs and expectations.” Achieving this requires access to consumer behavior and sales data across a range of sources. Digital giants such as Amazon and Netflix are able to pull together many of the pieces of this puzzle from their vast troves of user data, but smaller companies struggle to achieve the same partly through lack of access to the right sources but also lack of experience in managing data for competitive advantage.

Solutions that can pull together disparate and siloed information to provide a richer customer experience will be a solution to some companies. As IDC’s Maureen Fleming recently stated, “Companies who are truly digitally capable will be able to connect these disparate data sources, pull critical business-level data from these connections, and make informed business decisions in a way that delivers competitive advantage.” For many companies this is still a difficult journey but the rapid deployment of AI and machine learning to analytics and data processing makes it a vital journey if they are to survive the new wave of competition that is coming.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9691926836967468}",neutral,0.9691926836967468,0
Racing toward the future: the RACER high-speed demonstrator - Airbus,"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE4LTEwLXJhY2luZy10b3dhcmQtdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS10aGUtcmFjZXItaGlnaC1zcGVlZC1kZW1vbnN0cmF0b3LSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Article: Heather Couthaud



Tilt rotor or tilt prop, two rotors or one . . . the combinations for vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) vehicles run the gamut. Here, a layman’s look at why Airbus is developing the RACER high-speed demonstrator, and how it works.

Airbus Helicopters is nearing the end of its development phase on a unique research aircraft, the RACER* technology demonstrator, that will ultimately be used to demonstrate mission configurations. The company – working with 40 partners in 13 countries as part of the European Clean Sky 2 project – recently submitted key subsystems of the demonstrator to a preliminary design review and will begin manufacturing its first components. The final assembly of the RACER prototype is expected by the end of 2019.

Why RACER?

Aeromechanical engineers have long grappled with the challenge of making a vehicle able to take off vertically, hover, and achieve very fast cruise speeds—an almost-mythic combination of lift and forward thrust. But making one that is affordable and multi-mission . . . that is another matter.

Advances in the field of V/STOL** aircraft have given rise to scores of variations. Many models succeeded in experimental stages, some achieved production status—most at a significant cost or for a limited market.

Airbus Helicopters’ RACER demonstrator aims to go further, by showing that its particular combination of rotor, box wings and lateral propellers is the answer to cost-efficient, fast flight.

The limits of speed

So what distinguishes RACER’s architecture from other designs? The basic formula for a helicopter is that it have a main rotor and tail rotor. Engineers know the limits of this formula in terms of speed. “The only way to fly faster is to add either a wing or a second rotor, and propellers to increase the speed,” says Paul Eglin, senior expert at Airbus Helicopters, and the aeromechanics task leader in the RACER project.

If you want an aircraft to hover, nothing is better than the large diameter of a rotor. But in cruise, the rotor is limited by its aerodynamic behaviour: at very high speeds, through a combination of the rotation speed and the vehicle’s forward motion, the tip of the advancing blade reaches the speed of sound (Mach 1)—a critical point that affects the aircraft’s ability to maintain lift. At the same time, the retreating blade compensates for its lower speed (compared to the advancing blade) with an increased pitch angle, until it reaches the point of stall (loss of lift).

The simplest compound formula

The solution? Reduce the rotor’s speed of rotation. But this reduces its lift. The only way to go beyond this is to develop a compound formula which partially takes the burden of lift and propulsion off of the main rotor. “The open question was, is the RACER architecture the right way to proceed for a compound formula?” says Eglin. “Other concepts add a second rotor and have only one propeller, when we have two propellers. For us, RACER is the simplest formula to solve the problem of high speed.”

RACER’s two propellers are mounted on box wings—think of very thin, sleek biplane wings joined at the tips by the propellers’ bullet-shaped casing. The wings attain good cruise efficiency, and have a small surface area above to minimise their interaction with the main rotor wake when the aircraft is in hover.

The propellers are two lateral “pusher” types. In addition to providing thrust for high-speed cruise, they counteract the main rotor’s torque effect in hover, thus replacing the role of the tail rotor. In hover, the asymmetric tail boom benefits from the interaction from the main rotor wake to provide a significant contribution to the anti-torque function as well.

How it works

The underlying philosophy behind RACER’s design was simplicity. “When we speak about future products, it is important to develop things that are simple and robust,” says Tomasz Krysinski, Head of Research and Innovation at Airbus Helicopters.

This simplicity is illustrated in RACER’s transition – or lack thereof – when moving from hover to cruise. When the aircraft is stopped or cruising at slow speeds, the main rotor is responsible for lifting the aircraft. As speed increases, the wings then begin to progressively take over the job of providing lift, as they do in a standard fixed-wing aircraft. The pilot just has to reduce the angle at which the main rotor blades are positioned to maintain a constant altitude. For propelling the aircraft forward, a similar shifting of the burden takes place: as the main rotor propels the aircraft forward, the lateral propellers take over as speed increases. It all happens in progression, to the end benefit of the pilot at the controls.

“With RACER, we were guided by the search for a simple design because this results in an intuitive way of piloting, it’s safe and stable, and there is a lower cost in applying maintenance,” says Krysinski.

Fast in flight

An aerodynamic shape, lightweight materials, and equipment integrated in a streamlined manner - plus a myriad of tweaks and optimisations - make up a vehicle that flies 50% faster than conventional helicopters. This translates to potential big changes for operations like EMS, where the greatest chance of saving patients’ lives depends on getting them to help within the first “golden hour” of need; or search and rescue missions where a faster arrival on scene allows crews more time to effect a rescue.

"Airbus leveraging partnerships, investments to deliver greater ground truth - SpaceNews","Fri, 19 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXJidXMtbGV2ZXJhZ2luZy1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcHMtaW52ZXN0bWVudHMtdG8tZGVsaXZlci1ncmVhdGVyLWdyb3VuZC10cnV0aC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This article originally appeared in the Oct. 8, 2018 issue of SpaceNews magazine.

In August, Airbus Intelligence, a key player in the global geospatial industry, announced its Zephyr high-altitude drone set a world record, remaining aloft for nearly 26 days while gathering high-resolution imagery of Arizona. Airbus is investing heavily in Zephyr and Pléiades Neo, a constellation of four high-resolution electro-optical satellites, to enhance its Earth imagery, data and applications portfolio.

François Lombard, who took the helm at Airbus Intelligence in early 2017, is encouraging this type of innovation and partnerships like the ones formed recently with Earth observation constellation operator Planet and Orbital Insight, a geospatial analytics company. Lombard spoke with SpaceNews correspondent Debra Werner in September at the World Satellite Business Week conference in Paris.

You’ve announced partnerships recently. Why?

We always formed a lot of partnerships, small and big ones, but it is accelerating. It is getting more important to get the right strategic partners onboard. There is a lot of investment and new players in the industry. That is something we need to embrace. We need to pick the partners that help us to continue to grow and develop our products.

In June, Airbus announced a partnership with Planet. Why did you form that?

I joined Airbus Intelligence last year and I started discussions with a few companies at that time. I picked Planet as a very complementary player because they have different kinds of sensors and a different geographic position. There was a good fit between the teams. We are not overlapping too much. If we package our offers correctly, it can be an improvement for the customers.

In July, an Airbus-led consortium including Planet won a contract to provide high-resolution imagery of Europe for the European Commission and European Space Agency’s Copernicus Program. What will you deliver?

We are working together with Planet and a few other partners to package our different capabilities for the customers. Every two years, we will provide full coverage of Europe at very high resolution. One of the challenges is to get a homogeneous and cloud-free map of Europe in a very short timeframe. For this, you need both very high-quality sensors but also you need a lot of revisits to get this map right. Here, playing with a big constellation, even if the resolution is lower, on top of what we can already offer makes the product fit into the specifications.

How does Planet help you offer this high-resolution dataset?

In some areas, you will accept lower resolution cloud-free imagery rather than having nothing. Sometimes it is only 10 percent of the solution but that makes the difference in being able to deliver a full product with a level of perfection we could not reach if we were alone. On the same side, they alone could not offer a package that would fit the resolution. The fit between the two companies is good. I hope we will replicate this kind of offer very soon.

Do you have other new partners?

We signed a structural agreement partnership with Orbital Insight. The idea is to complement our offers with their analytics. Orbital Insight benefits because they get more access to our data. We build bridges between our database and their tools. We will integrate their analytics for our customers on our OneAtlas platform.

This is a big strategic partnership the consequence of hard work over the last 12 months to get the partner right and to get the partnership right in the details.

Airbus has such breadth. Why does it need partners?

I am trying fight this perception that we could do everything. Yes, we could if we wanted. But can you be world-class on every small step of the value chain? I have some doubt, or at least it will take more time. Through this kind of partnership, you can go faster and you can disrupt some parts of the market. We could do it alone but it goes faster and better if we do it this way.

In this specific segment, the geospatial segment, Airbus has been investing a lot of money and effort for two years. It will continue over the next years. We are developing a large set of new systems.

What new systems?

Last year, we announced Pléiades Neo, four very high-resolution satellites we will start to launch in 2020. That was a big step for us to make this investment. We are making everything new, all the technologies from the analytics to the cloud-based solutions.

When you say fully private, do you mean Airbus is the only investor?

This is just Airbus money. It’s a follow-on for us of the two Pléiades satellites we have currently, which are working very nicely. It’s our workhorse to a certain extent. We decided to invest 100 percent Airbus money on the next generation: four satellites, enormous capacity and going down to 30-centimeter resolution. Today Pléiades products are in the 50- to 70-centimeter range. There is only one comparable product on the market at 30 centimeters from our competitor DigitalGlobe.

Is radar an important part of your business?

It has been a very important part especially for the United States. Currently, we have three satellites. We have TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X and a Spanish partner (Hisdesat) launched a third (PAZ) at the beginning of this year. The three satellites will be operated in a constellation.

We flew two of the satellites very close together to generate a Data Elevation Model of the world’s entire landmass, WorldDEM, which is the best quality you can get. We started delivering it in 2016. We have now delivered the full program, which is being used in the U.S. for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. It’s the same in Europe and allied countries. It is the full globe in a 3D model. There is more and more commercial usage of this kind of product. We deliver derivatives to companies that use it as part of their geospatial tools and products. It’s different from the optical market because here we deliver products rather than getting a call and delivering an image.

Do you also deliver radar images?

We deliver satellite images from the radar, which can be very interesting in cases when you have clouds. When you cannot get good optical data, the radar is great. And it brings you even more data than an optical image for maritime and defense applications, for example.

The radar business sounds strong.

It is. It is smaller in size than the optical business. It is less mature. We started optical 32 years ago. We flew our first radar satellite in 2007.

With radar, depending on the mode you can get different kinds of information. You can measure movements of the Earth, even a few centimeters or millimeters in some instances. We offer access to a comprehensive satellite constellation, made up of radar and optical sensors, with access to third-party sensors. Our customer gets a one-stop shop. He can, for instance, buy a Direct Receiving Station and get access to all the capabilities he needs.

What is your plan for Zephyr?

We call it a pseudo-satellite. We put a camera on it to make images which are very complementary to what we get from satellites because it is persistent imagery. We can monitor a medium-size city with one Zephyr. This summer in the U.S., we made a world record on flying the drone without landing for almost 26 days. We took thousands of pictures from the drone at more than 20 kilometers altitude, above air traffic. We are hoping this kind of innovation will bring some disruptions in the services we offer.

We also continue to invest in everything on the ground related to the processing, cloud-based solutions and digital platform to make sure all this data is made available in an easy way. Easy to stream, easy to download, easy to have access to the full archives and easy to use for machine learning and analytics.

Is that ease necessary because new geospatial data customers don’t have geospatial expertise?

The number of users is increasing and the more users we get, the less they are interested in the scientific elements of the geospatial industry. Some of them need access to information in our images without touching the image itself. We are already delivering to thousands of customers. Maybe in a few years, it will be hundreds of thousands. This is what we need to prepare for.

The second aspect is machine learning and artificial intelligence. If you want to leverage that, you need to put the data in a specific context with a certain depth of archives. This will encourage small companies developing their own applications. We need to get ready for that.

Small companies often need radar data to train their algorithms. You have a lot of data.

Yes. It’s true. We need to find a way to make it more available. It’s easier with optical data because the images are more comparable. For radar, you need to decide which mode you use. If you have different images with different modes, you cannot do any learning on that. And there are fewer radar satellites in the world than there are optical satellites. That’s why you see startups trying to disrupt this market by bringing more revisit, more data to the analytics companies.

What do you think of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) on small satellites?

There are a lot of companies trying to push their small SAR concepts. I see some that are successful. For some others, we are a bit more doubtful whether it works either technically or commercially. We are watching that very carefully. I will not mention names but I think there are a few companies doing a really great job that can work with us as well. We can find this fit together for the benefit of the customers: more revisits adding to our very exquisite higher resolution offers. This will ramp up. The U.S. is one of the most interesting markets for that.

Are you focused on other innovation?

Yes. In the application world, we are continuing to invest where we can make the difference for the customers. The key is to create an ecosystem where you bring partners. It can be very small partners. You give them the right access. They develop the right applications. And you benefit from it. Here, my approach is similar to what Apple did with the App Store.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9098333716392517}",neutral,0.9098333716392517,0

• Through the agreement, an additional 400 Delta aircraft will be connected to Skywise

Delta Air Lines has entered into a multi-year contract with Airbus to continue using the Skywise open-data platform and related predictive maintenance services. The airline will expand the use of the tool to its A320 and A330 fleets – comprising around 400 aircraft – to track and analyse their operations and performance data and assess failure probabilities in order to anticipate maintenance tasks.

Delta was one of the airlines involved in the development of Skywise Predictive Maintenance by co-designing, testing and making improvement recommendations about some of its key features.

“Skywise is the latest example of our great partnership with Airbus,” said Ed Bastian, Delta’s CEO. “Delta people are continuously focused on improving the experience for customers, and this new tool will enable them to provide an exceptional, reliable experience.”

“I’m extremely proud to see our long-time partner Delta Air Lines, one of the leading airlines of the world, join the Skywise platform,” said Tom Enders, Airbus’ CEO. “Skywise is propelling the aviation industry to new levels of productivity and efficiency, and it is truly becoming an industry flagship. I want to thank Delta for their trust and confidence.”

Skywise was developed to enable Airbus, airlines, equipment manufacturers and maintenance operators to tap into vast amounts of aircraft operational and performance data and identify areas of improvement. Skywise can gather and track many thousands of data parameters on aircraft in operation.

Use of the Skywise-based applications to analyse extensive aircraft data can enable airlines to identify efficiencies, cost savings and enhanced revenue opportunities. Key applications help airlines reduce operational interruptions, maximise aircraft utilisation and flight operations. In particular, Skywise Predictive Maintenance enables them to turn unscheduled maintenance into scheduled maintenance and thus optimise aircraft operations. Airbus rolled-out the Skywise platform at the Paris Air Show in 2017.

Airbus initiative aims at integrator role for IoT on board - Runway Girl Network,"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTgvMTAvYWlyYnVzLWluaXRpYXRpdmUtYWltcy1hdC1pbnRlZ3JhdG9yLXJvbGUtZm9yLWlvdC1vbi1ib2FyZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is positioning itself as the integrator, data organizer and service provider for the Internet of Things on board its aircraft, in order both to realize the tactical operational benefits of the growing number of sensors used, and to generate strategic intelligence on the future of cabin design, vice president cabin marketing Ingo Wuggetzer told Runway Girl Network at the APEX EXPO in Boston.

“It’s about connecting all the elements in the cabin,” Wuggetzer explained, to “collect the data, and use it for cost improvement, for operational improvement. But of course, and this is the challenge, also for revenue generation and better passenger experience. Our role in that ecosystem is then that we enable it; we provide a flexible, wireless data backbone just to provide that service, get the data together, and give it to those people who want it and who have an idea how to use it.”

Airlines are asking Airbus to produce that data in a single, structured set for their own different sets of needs, whether that looks like short-term operational requirements, ongoing predictive analytics, or long-term strategic planning. The company is not yet certain whether it intends to brand the project within its Skywise portfolio, where Airbus has been working with controversial technology corporation Palantir to create its most recent foray into the world of IoT.

An Airbus engineer recently shared details about the airframer’s Skywise work on board an A330neo aircraft, which was used in testing and is being delivered to TAP Air Portugal. He said Airbus was focused on moving a lot of the data on the ground, rather than in-flight.

The move towards serving as an IoT integrator, Wuggetzer said, is partly to take airlines’ temperatures on having an OEM do this work rather than one of the industry’s integrators. “For me, there’s something that we should do ourselves. It’s an infrastructure of the aircraft — that should come from our side.”

On the short-term side of things, “what is relevant for an airline might be different, right? We had even people from catering were extremely interested, and worked with them, [and] people who look at the data analysis and predict what you would like to eat in your next flight. You don’t know, but they know. You can use that pattern about history to better perform and cater, better deliver to the needs, but also avoid waste,” Wuggetzer explained.

Part of the work will necessarily include creating a sort of prioritization categorization for data, with options including: the most urgent tactical data that would presently perhaps be sent over ACARS, a kind of medium-high priority that might be sent over a satellite link shared with the cabin, a medium-low priority category that could be transmitted by 4G on the ground, and a low-priority bucket that might use gate wifi.

“I think we definitely have to have a look at this in general,” Wuggetzer said. “What we did in Skywise is that we download the information only on ground. That’s how the system is designed, because what we believe in is to collect all the data, then you do predictive maintenance.”

That scope would be substantially beyond work Airbus has been doing on inflight connectivity, and would seem to be an opportunity for a substantial enabler for improvements in operations and passenger experience: providing a platform for an ecosystem to develop has been something of a killer app unicorn for the industry.

Airbus is also mooting the idea as a way to start conversations about its role here with its airline customers. “That’s why we are investing in it and want to do that research together with our customer, because we are always customer centric. Of course, we need their buy-in, but also their guidance, because there are a lot of operation needs and improvements,” Wuggetzer said.

It will be interesting to see the industry’s reaction to this proposition, particularly in the context of a wider push among airframers to take a larger piece of the pie previously dominated by integrators, in the further context of those integrators themselves growing in size and complexity as suppliers combine to gain scale.

Flash flooding in Pennsylvania took residents by surprise this August. Thanks to a National Guard Lakota stationed nearby, 19 people were ultimately hoisted to safety. A look at how the crew’s quick response made all the difference.

The video footage from the aircraft shows scenes of the flood’s aftermath: clusters of trucks and cars stopped at the edge of a brown lake where once a road had been; white clapboard homes underwater up to their windows; a couple on a roof, waving at the National Guard helicopter overhead.

On 13 August 2018, parts of central and eastern Pennsylvania were subject to torrential rains that resulted in flash flooding. Flying out of Muir Army Airfield, Fort Indiantown Gap in the southeast of the state, CW2 Dave Berry and SSG John Goodwin of Det 1B 1-224th S&S were performing counterdrug operations with Major Ernie Carlson when they received word of the emergency.

“We were assigned to paint the picture for the task force commander and establish command and control of the situation,” says Major Carlson, the second-in-command pilot that day. “This was the first time that Pennsylvania utilised the UH-72A as a search and rescue platform as well as a command and control aircraft.”

The Lakota did exactly what it was designed to on this day.

- Major Ernie Carlson, Pennsylvania Army National Guard pilot and counterdrug aviation officer

The scope of the emergency

Arriving on scene in marginal visual flight rules (VFR) conditions, pilot-in-command Berry set up a communication node with ground-based rescue units on the radio, while system operator Goodwin used the Lakota’s forward looking infrared (FLIR) and daytime camera to zoom in on people stranded on their roofs or standing in knee-deep water. As the scope of the emergency became apparent, they radioed for support from two hoist-equipped helicopters from the 28th Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade.

For almost three hours, the Lakota’s three-man crew performed the vital role of search and rescue coordinator. In a scene typical of the day a helicopter crew performs a hoist while nearby, the Lakota hovers around 1,000 feet, surveying the area to the east. Zooming in, they spot a swift-moving river with swollen banks and an upended a bulldozer; a lone man stands on the machine’s arm, surrounded by swirling water, staring up at the helicopter.

“The Lakota did exactly what it was designed to on this day,” says Carlson. “With the low ceiling and heavy rain showers, systems like the autopilot provide a world of comfort. If we had to punch into the clouds, we could safely do so. The range is much longer [than that of other aircraft in the National Guard fleet] so we could keep communications going while the others refueled. There was never a time when there was not an aircraft on station.”

Risky rescue

“The rescue that stands out is the elderly woman that our ground guys couldn’t get to,” says Carlson. “We circled the area a few times before Sergeant Goodwin got on the radio and said, ‘tell her to go to a porch where we can see her.’ We zoomed the camera from the Lakota right inside that porch and were able to identify the house where she was. By that time, [the rescue helicopter] was fuel critical so with the information they got from us, they made the decision to drop a rescue swimmer to stay with her until a second aircraft could get there.”

In total, the Lakota flew nearly nine hours in aid of flood victims. “In after-action comments,” says Carlson, “The task force commander mentioned that the reason we were so successful that day was because of the UH-72A’s role providing command and control.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999727010726929}",neutral,0.9999727010726929,0

Airbus leaving off the “I” for “Innovation” on A220 cabin? - Runway Girl Network,"Sat, 13 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTgvMTAvYWlyYnVzLWxlYXZpbmctb2ZmLXRoZS1pLWZvci1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLW9uLWEyMjAtY2FiaW4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“A220 FAMLY” boasted the Airbus stand’s cabin mockup on day 1 of the APEX EXPO in Boston, with a rather prominent “I” missing. By the next day, someone had taken a marker to the stand, filling the gap between the letters. Harder to add back in was visible innovation on the passenger experience front for the former C Series, which has hardly changed since it was on stands with Bombardier signs on them in previous years.

With 2019 shaping up to be the year of the middle-of-the-market airplane, Airbus has yet to reveal precisely how the A220 fits into the picture it has been drawing with the A321neo, A321LR and A320neo, particularly given the lack of market response to the A319neo.

In passenger experience terms, the C Series was already a strong contender, nearly winning a Crystal Cabin Award when up against Qatar Airways’ Qsuite and United Airlines’ Polaris products. The question for this passenger experience season was to determine how the A220 fit into the A320 context, ironically enough given that the aircraft that spurred Airbus to redesign the A320neo cabin with the narrowbody implementation of Airspace — and the shift in mentality at the airframer to do so should not be underestimated — is now under the same proverbial corporate roof.

At the EXPO, Airbus was certainly putting the case forward that the A220 fits into the Airspace family of cabin interiors.

“Visitors to the A220 mock-up will experience the aircraft’s passenger-pleasing features including wide seats and aisle, high-capacity overhead baggage stowage and large windows,” said Airbus’ media messaging at the show, but on the ground it was really just a few rows of the same Zodiac seats in the same PaxEx-positive cross-section with the same bins and the same big windows that are familiar to observers.

What seems particularly missing in the A220 is premium seating beyond a 2-2 recliner option, which for the cross-section would be quite a narrow set of seats: thinner than the 2-2 on a DC-9/MD-80/Boeing 717 cross-section, and quite a bit thinner than a 737’s 2-2 or Embraer E-Jet’s 1-2 layout.

Delta’s first A220, the first to be delivered with any premium seating beyond Eurobusiness, took its first flight this week. With Embraer’s thought-provoking staggered seating layout on the E2 generation of E-Jet, the premium question feels very much like an obvious one to answer.

Indeed, it’s an open question for customers like jetBlue and David Neeleman’s new baby (which we’ll call Moxy, although that won’t be the name), which may well be interested in playing with the range numbers for a lighter, more premium-focussed CS300: the “Junior Mint” that jetBlue has already stated it is considering.

Looking more widely, it would be understandable if the answer to this question were part of a formal strategy: a sort of “if you want a premium cabin on this size aircraft, you probably want an A320neo or, at a pinch, an A319neo” message.

Given the replacement by chief commercial officer Christian Scherer of Eric Schulz after less than a year, and indeed in the transition at the top of the Airbus group and its commercial division, it would be no great surprise if the messaging still requires further decision-making.

One key element will be what supplier lock-in remains as a holdover from the C Series to the A220. RGN understands that the Zodiac Aerospace — originally via the California-based C&D Zodiac, with Zodiac now itself part of wider conglomerate Safran after the latest round of industry consolidation — has substantial exclusivity which may well restrict the options available. An Airbus-Safran set of negotiations will naturally be a different landscape than a Bombardier-Zodiac one, and may unlock further options.

Airbus may well have wanted a full year cycle of “same aircraft, different sales team” for the C Series-to-A220 transition. But there will come a point fairly soon where the questions about exactly what prospective customers can put inside the aircraft will become impossible to ignore.

Faury served in various senior management roles at Eurocopter from 1998 to 2008 before joining Peugeot in 2009 where he served as executive vice president for research and development.

In May 2013, he returned to Airbus as CEO of Airbus Helicopters and in early 2018 he took the helm of Airbus Commercial Aircraft.

Enders said: “Guillaume is an excellent choice. He has gained broad industrial and aeronautic experience over many years and in many roles both inside and outside Airbus.

“With his strong values and international mindset, Guillaume stands for the new generation of leaders that Airbus needs for the coming decade. He knows he can rely on me to facilitate a smooth transition.”

Airbus chairman Denis Ranque added that Faury’s global outlook, extensive operational experience, strong personal values and straightforward leadership style made him the “ideal candidate to rally Airbus teams”.

Ranque, meanwhile, will continue as chairman until the end of his mandate in April 2020.

In September 2018, Airbus increased the order book for its best-selling A320 Family with orders for 37 of the single-aisle aircraft, while delivering 69 jetliners during the month from across its A220, A320, A330, A350 XWB and A380 product lines.

September’s new business was led by 25 A321neo aircraft for VivaAerobus – the ultra-low-cost carrier based in Mexico, along with seven A320neo and three A321neo jetliners for Swiss International Air Lines.

Completing the month’s bookings were one A320neo for Oman’s budget airline, SalamAir; and an ACJ320ceo for an unnamed customer.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9414570331573486}",positive,0.9414570331573486,1

“Airbus Helicopters has been supporting the air medical market in North America since its creation, and we are proud to further our partnership with customers to help save lives in the safest and most modern aircraft,” said Chris Emerson, president of Airbus Helicopters, Inc. and head of the North America region.

REACH Air Medical Services will add three H125s and two H130s to its current fleet. The new aircraft slated for delivery later this year, will allow REACH to expand its service area while modernizing its fleet. Headquartered in Sacramento, Calif., REACH is a subsidiary of Global Medical Response (GMR), which provides critical care air transport service to communities throughout California, Oregon, Nevada, Montana, Texas, and Colorado.

Also at the show, Airbus welcomed a new customer – Medical Air Rescue Company (MARC) –which signed for its first Airbus helicopter, the H130. The acquisition is part of the company’s long-term plan to modernize its fleet and expand its operations into the challenging mountainous regions in Wyoming, where the aircraft will be based. Scheduled for delivery in December, the new aircraft will help the growing organization serve roughly 2,400 patients a year across South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, Nebraska and Texas.

These orders come on the heels of two milestones for the twin-engine H145 in North America’s EMS market. In March 2018, Boston MedFlight took delivery of its first of three H145s. And in 2019, the H145 will begin EMS flights in Canada for the first time with Alberta-based STARS air ambulance, which was selected as the preferred aircraft type for their fleet renewal.

Airbus Helicopters remains the leading provider of emergency medical helicopters for North American operators. In the past decade alone, nearly two-thirds of all new EMS helicopters sold in the United States were produced by Airbus Helicopters. Today, more than 90 EMS operators in North America rely on more than 1,230 Airbus helicopters for their emergency care transport needs.

Airbus to deliver Canada's first H145 in HEMS configuration to STARS air ambulance - Airbus,"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0xMC1haXJidXMtdG8tZGVsaXZlci1jYW5hZGFzLWZpcnN0LWgxNDUtaW4taGVtcy1jb25maWd1cmF0aW9uLXRvLXN0YXJz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Fort Erie, Ontario, Following an extensive RFP process, Airbus’ H145 was selected as the fleet replacement aircraft for STARS air ambulance’s aging fleet, becoming the first H145s in HEMS configuration to enter Canada.



The twin-engine H145 was chosen thanks to its exceptional HEMS heritage and safety record with its BK117 and EC145 predecessors. Offering the largest cabin in its class and unbeatable payload, the H145 is perfectly suited for STARS’ mission requirements.

The H145, with HEMS interior, will support STARS’ highly skilled professionals in providing a safe, rapid, highly specialized emergency medical transport for the critically ill and injured, many of which are located in rural areas.

“The impressive new H145 fleet is a generational investment in our future, helping us continue to provide critical care services for decades to come,” said Andrea Robertson, President and Chief Executive Officer of STARS. “A unified fleet is considered best practice in terms of safety, fleet management, dispatch flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.”

The first tranche of H145s will be delivered in 2019 and will be based out of STARS’ Calgary, Alberta base.

“STARS air ambulance has set a fantastic record and example for EMS operations, not only in Western Canada but across the country,” said Romain Trapp, President of Airbus Helicopters Canada. “We thank STARS for entrusting Airbus and the H145 to support their life-saving operations. We look forward to accompanying STARS on their journey to serve patients in Western Canada for generations to come.”

Airbus’ H145 is Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA) certified and is the latest member of its 4-ton-class twin-engine rotorcraft product range. To date, the global H145 fleet has achieved more than 100,000 flight hours since entry into service in 2015, with more than 200 units delivered.

The helicopter is easily customized for intensive care transport, due to its easy and safe loading/unloading of patients through wide side sliding doors and large rear clamshell doors. The H145’s spacious, unobstructed cabin provides full body access and greater comfort for the medical crew, and its extremely low external sound levels allow neighbourhood-friendly operations around hospitals and in urban areas.

Rolls-Royce hit by delay to engine for new Airbus jet - CNBC,"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTgvMTAvMjYvcm9sbHMtcm95Y2UtaGl0LWJ5LWRlbGF5LXRvLWVuZ2luZS1mb3ItbmV3LWFpcmJ1cy1qZXQuaHRtbNIBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDE4LzEwLzI2L3JvbGxzLXJveWNlLWhpdC1ieS1kZWxheS10by1lbmdpbmUtZm9yLW5ldy1haXJidXMtamV0Lmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"British aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce said on Friday it would deliver fewer Trent 7000 engines this year than initially expected due to production problems, hitting both its shares and those of major customer Airbus .

Rolls-Royce shares plunged as much as 13 percent to a 1-1/2 year low of 747 pence after Bloomberg reported the delays. At 1230 GMT, they were down 4.6 percent at 832 pence, while Airbus's shares were down 2.9 percent at 95.07 euros.

Rolls-Royce said in a statement it now expected to deliver about 500 large engines this year, down from about 550 previously, and that it was working closely with customers such as Airbus, which is using the Trent 7000 on its new A330neo jet.

The problems come as the European planemaker is itself rushing to meet delivery targets this year.

The widebody A330 has historically been a second key source of cash for Airbus behind its best-selling A320, but the latest model has been hit by weak sales and engine reliability problems in testing.

""While the production ramp up issues in Q4 (the fourth quarter) are regrettable, such issues in the early stages of a new engine programme are not uncommon in our industry,"" Rolls-Royce said, reiterating its financial guidance for 2018.

""As we move into 2019 we are confident that Trent 7000 production and delivery volumes will increase significantly to meet our customer commitments.""

Rolls-Royce has also been grappling with problems affecting blades on its Trent 1000 engines for more than two years, and last month said it was still managing durability issues within its fleet and was replacing affected parts.

The 7000 is derived from the 1000, but Rolls-Royce's chief executive Warren East said in June the new engine was not affected by the Trent 1000 problems.

East said in August the company faced challenges in producing significant quantities of its new engines - 7000s and 97Ks - in the second half, but was well positioned to overcome them.

Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard said in a note Rolls-Royce could have to compensate Airbus and airlines.

Market sources say the A330neo, a refresh of the A330 launched with fuel-saving engines in 2014 at a time when oil was above $100 a barrel, has struggled to make its mark because of lower oil prices and the popularity of the underlying model.

Additionally, Boeing has been targeting potential customers with its newer Boeing 787, many powered by alternative engines from Rolls-Royce rival General Electric.

Airbus and Rolls-Royce say the A330neo could benefit from a trend towards low-cost, long-haul operations, the economics of which are looking more attractive as oil prices return to $80.

But there are continued doubts about a major order from AirAsia , which is now looking at smaller A321neo aircraft to replace part of its deal for 100 A330neo jets.

[Photo/Xinhua]

European aircraft manufacturer Airbus SE said it hopes to cooperate with more Chinese suppliers, including private enterprises, as it continues to expand cooperation with Chinese industrial players, a senior company executive said.

Next week, an A320 aircraft that is expected to be delivered from the Airbus A320 family final assembly line in Tianjin to China Express Air will be equipped with seats produced by Hubei province-based Jiatai Aircraft Equipment Co Ltd, the first time that an A320 aircraft is using seats produced by a Chinese supplier.

""We hope to cooperate with more Chinese suppliers in producing structural parts, such as lavatories, ceilings and seats. This will help us to save a significant amount of transportation costs and raise efficiency,"" Klaus Richter, chief procurement officer of Airbus, said on Tuesday in Beijing.

""We are also convincing our European and US suppliers to come to China to set up plants and make investments in the country,"" he said.

For the company's single-aisle family aircraft, Airbus usually spends about $15 billion to $20 billion a year on the procurement of flying parts, which involve more than 250 suppliers, including a number of Chinese suppliers, according to Airbus.

Globally, Airbus cooperates with more than 1,500 suppliers on flying parts. Overall, the manufacturer cooperates with around 10,000 suppliers, including general procurement.

Besides, Aviation Industry Corp of China Ltd recently obtained the qualification to produce galleys for A320 aircraft that will be delivered from Tianjin, and Airbus would like to develop a cabin supply chain with AVIC.

Currently, China serves as the largest market for Airbus, followed by the United States. By 2020, the total output from industrial cooperation between Airbus and Chinese companies is expected to reach $1 billion. The amount was $641 million last year and $120 million in 2008, Airbus said.

Airbus would like to form a vertical integration supply chain in China, which means Airbus will purchase raw materials, and assemble parts and aircraft in China, said Francois Mery, chief operating officer of Airbus Commercial Aircraft China.

Meanwhile, Airbus' US archrival Boeing unveiled its first overseas completion and delivery center for its single-aisle aircraft in Zhoushan, Zhejiang province, last year. By the end of this year, Boeing will deliver the first single-aisle B737 MAX plane directly from Zhoushan to a domestic airline.

""One-fifth of single-aisle aircraft globally are delivered to China. It is a huge market that both Airbus and Boeing hope to seize,"" said Lin Zhijie, an aviation industry analyst and columnist at Carnoc, a leading civil aviation website portal in China.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999866247177124}",neutral,0.999866247177124,0

October 30, 2018, © Leeham News: Airbus announced 3Q 2019 results today. Revenue and profits for the first nine months were up from last year but the company is still wrestling with delivery problems for A320neos from its Hamburg factories. The delays during the first nine months cannot be caught up and the delivery guidance for 2019 is now 860 aircraft instead of 880-890.

Guided free cash flow will suffer as a result while profits for the year are guided unchanged as the first nine months delivered healthy profits.

Airbus is to 76% commercial aircraft, which depends on 74% A320neo deliveries

Airbus’ revenue for the first nine months was €46.29bn (€40.4bn 3Q2018) with operating profit at €4.1bn (€2.7bn) which is 9% of revenue versus 6.8% a year ago. Free Cash Flow was affected by the A320 delays at -€4.9bn versus -€4.2 a year ago.

The dominant Commercial Aircraft (76% of revenue) continues its weak order intake with orders for only 127 aircraft during the first nine months. Its strong A320neo program and smooth ramp of the A350 brings it increased revenues, €35.6bn (€30.5bn) and healthy profits €3.4bn (€2.2bn).

The Helicopter division is flat in a difficult market, compensating with services when deliveries weaken whereas Defense and Space is slightly positive (revenue up 9% at €7.7bn with operating profits slightly down at €355m).

Guidance for 2019 for Commercial Aircraft was adjusted to 860 aircraft deliveries, down from the previous 880-890. Airbus’ free cash flow is now guided at €3bn (€4bn). It maintains profits will increase by about 15% over last year.

Commercial aircraft

The revenue and profit increase was delivered by the A320 deliveries (422 versus 395 last year), the A320neo premium and the A350 program (77 versus 61) no longer eating cash. Total deliveries to date were 571 versus 503 last year. While better than 2018 it still leaves 289 aircraft to deliver in 4Q which is a continued challenge.

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said “ “We are focused on the A320neo ramp-up and improving the industrial flow while managing the higher level of complexity on the A321 ACF in particular. Our nine-month delivery numbers and the updated delivery outlook for the year reflect the underlying actions to secure a more efficient delivery flow in the next years as we progress to rate 63 per month for the A320 Family in 2021.”

What he says is its time to stop chasing the yearly numbers at all cost as this hits next year’s numbers and the delivery rat race just goes on. Airbus must come out of heroic fourth quarters saving the results, it can’t be a three-quarter company any longer.

The trade war with the US is a new problem with doubts who will shoulder any import taxes. For existing orders, Gauillame hinted at a split burden whereas new orders will see the customer pay.

The A440M

Ten A400M were delivered with several important capability achievements reached during the nine months (fueling of helicopters, deployments of 80 paratroopers). The program is still eating cash at a higher pace than planned but the program is now in a more stable phase.

Airbus’ safety scanner system cuts an hour off preflight checks - Runway Girl Network,"Tue, 02 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTgvMTAvYWlyYnVzLXNhZmV0eS1zY2FubmVyLXN5c3RlbS1jdXRzLWFuLWhvdXItb2ZmLXByZWZsaWdodC1jaGVja3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Using RFID tags and scanners, Airbus is working with Fujitsu to virtually eliminate the time required for flight attendants to check for the presence of key emergency equipment, replacing it with a crew-operated scanning system.

Airbus’ Smart Emergency Equipment Manager uses commercially available radio-frequency identification scanners to sweep the cabin in a matter of minutes to ensure that crucial items like lifejackets are present (Delta Air Lines has worked with another provider on a similar program for years).

The new system from Airbus and Fujitsu, nicknamed S-EEM, is currently flying on jet aircraft operated a by major international carrier in the Asia-Pacific region. Patrice Marin and Kais Makhlouf, Internet of Things Services directors within the airframer’s Interior Services division, demonstrated the handheld scanner to Runway Girl Network at the APEX EXPO, and the simplicity and benefits of the system were impressive.

“Airlines currently have to do a lot of inspection task visually and what we are providing is a fast digital inspection tool for that,” Marin tells RGN. “We have made some proof of concept, and also we have feedback from our customers, and what they say is we can go up to 95%, 99% of time saving.”

Key emergency equipment has an unfortunate habit of going missing from aircraft as the result of passengers swiping an inappropriate souvenir of their trip, with leisure-focussed and low-cost carriers in particular finding themselves at the sharp end of ensuring that items are present and replacing them if necessary.

“In minutes you can say that — for an inspection that today takes more than one hour, an hour and a half — you go for less than five minutes, a few minutes,” Marin says, noting that “we are just talking here about minutes of inspection but you have to add some administrative work behind that, a lot of PC work, paperwork, this is not taken into account.”

The technology behind the system is passive RFID tags for the equipment being checked. The passive RFID tags mean that there is no electromagnetic interference on the aircraft. A sticker, for example, might be affixed to a life jacket or other item, although in due course the tag might be included at the time of manufacturing.

A flight attendant (or, potentially, another airline employee) then passes a handheld scanner through the cabin, and the software on the device attached to the scanner then determines and displays on a screen whether the correct items are present.

Beyond the clear benefits of this particular system, Airbus is continuing in what feels like an ongoing mission to become a service provider to its airline customers.

Working with a major technology player like Fujitsu, together with integrating the product and certifying it via major international aviation safety certification authorities, seems a step towards Airbus’ wider goal to play a larger part in the integration game — which is growing in importance alongside the digitalisation of aircraft and their cabins — while leveraging its strengths in certification and regulator management.

“What we have done — and this is something that we aren’t the only one to be doing — is we provide the service, the software, but we also do all the due diligence beforehand, Makhlouf explains. “So when we come to discuss with the local authority, we have hundreds of pages of due diligence in order to justify how we manage that kind of deployment and how we go from visual inspection to something which is more technological.”

“[The United States] FAA has provided their agreement for this solution and we have no technical objection from EASA,” Marin says, “but we are working with EASA to improve this and have a formal agreement.”

For the airline already using S-EEM, Airbus worked with the carrier’s national regulator to demonstrate the system’s safety through the FAA technical agreement documentation.

US Army eyes high-altitude UAVs like Airbus Zephyr - Flightglobal,"Tue, 09 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vY2l2aWwtdWF2cy91cy1hcm15LWV5ZXMtaGlnaC1hbHRpdHVkZS11YXZzLWxpa2UtYWlyYnVzLXplcGh5ci8xMjk4MTQuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The US Army Futures Command, a new group leading the service’s modernization efforts, is enthusiastic about using high-altitude unmanned air vehicles for a variety of missions, including as communications hubs.

Willie Nelson, director of the US Army Futures Command’s assured positioning, navigation and timing cross-functional team, said he traveled to the United Kingdom to visit Airbus, the manufacturer of the Zephyr, a high-altitude UAV. In July, Zephyr set the world record for flight endurance in July after staying aloft using solar cells for 25 days 23h 57min. The aircraft flies as high as 74,000ft during the daytime.

“I think they are an incredible capability that we should continue to invest [science and technology] dollars into research and development,” he says. “The British, the Zephyr programme, I think there is a tremendous opportunity to partner with them.”

The UK Ministry of Defence has three Zephyr UAVs on order.

The US Army lacks a funded programme to acquire high-altitude UAVs, but is surveying a variety of high altitude platforms, also called pseudosatellites, including Google's Project Loon, a high-altitude balloon, says Nelson. Other companies developing high-altitude UAVs include BAE Systems and AeroVironment.

High-altitude UAVs have recently become practical for the US Army not only because of their ability to fly for weeks without landing, but also due to the shrinking size of communications equipment, says Nelson.

“Their biggest limiting factor, quite frankly, is there weight [capacity]” he says. “With the advent of software defined radios and a lot of things we are able to get kit down very small and the weight is decreasing measurably.”

In addition to communications equipment platforms, high-altitude UAVs could be used to carry positioning, navigation and timing electronics and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance sensors, he says.

Airbus's Racer compound progresses towards 2020 first flight - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzcy1yYWNlci1jb21wb3VuZC1wcm9ncmVzc2VzLXRvd2FyZHMtMjAyMC1maXJzdC1mbGlnaHQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At the Helitech International show in Amsterdam, Airbus Helicopters and partners on the Racer demonstration program have explained how they expect to meet performance targets and remain on time for a first flight of the compound helicopter in 2020.

The program is ambitious, with a a cruise speed of 220 knots and a cost targeted to be 25 percent lower, per nautical mile, than with a conventional helicopter. The target speed is seen as the optimal tradeoff between fuel consumption and productivity. “We hope to beat the speed record again,” added Tomasz Krysinski, head of research and innovation at Airbus Helicopters. He was referring to the speed record the previous demonstrator, the X3, set in 2013 at an unofficial 255 knots.

The preliminary design review was passed last July. “It allows [us] to freeze interfaces and 3D definitions of the main subsystems, prior to detailed design and manufacture of key components,” said Krysinski.

Final assembly is planned to begin in the fourth quarter of 2019. Asked how such a timing can be compatible with a first flight the year after, program manager David Alfano said that devising assembly procedures for a prototype is faster than with a production aircraft. “Lots of simplifications are doable, an approximate knowledge of where to drill holes for electrical harnesses is sufficient,” he said.

The 7-8 metric-ton aircraft will feature some advanced components. Each lateral drive shaft will be three meters long and will spin at 3,000 rpm. A prototype shaft has been manufactured to validate the manufacturing process (though it will not fly).

Each lateral gear box will feature a conformal heat exchanger. Avio Aero has developed an additive manufacturing method to give the exchanger a round shape, as opposed to rectangular. It will better use the space around the gear box. The bottom line is a reduced drag, explained Alessandro Bordoni, engineering, new product introduction sub-section manager.

Aernnova is developing an out-of-autoclave technique to create the empennage.

The flight-test program is envisaged at 200 flight hours. The second part will focus on demonstrating the aircraft is well suited to various missions such as emergency medical services, police and search-and-rescue. The plan is an indication of Airbus’s willingness to exhaustively explore the concept, beyond demonstrating the technology.

The Racer program is part of the EU’s Clean Sky 2 “joint technology initiative,” a public-private partnership to advance the environmental performance of aviation.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995450377464294}",neutral,0.9995450377464294,0

Delta Air Lines’ first Airbus A220 took off on its maiden flight over the skies of Quebec on Saturday.

The aircraft, which departed from the A220 assembly line facility near Montreal, was flown by A220 program test pilots on a two-hour, 53-minute flight. Crews checked the aircraft’s main systems before returning to Mirabel, Quebec, according to Airbus.

The A220, which was known as the ""Bombardier CSeries"" until it was rebranded in July, is likely to begin flying for Delta in early 2019.

The A220-100 variant bound for Delta will now undergo a series of flight tests before the first delivery to the carrier, which is likely to come early next year.

Delta is the first U.S. carrier to order the jet. Delta’s order for at least 75 of the aircraft threw a lifeline to the then-struggling CSeries. Airbus has since taken a majority stake in the aircraft line, which precipitated the new name.

Delta will become the first U.S. carrier to operate the A220 and the fourth worldwide. Swiss International Air Lines, AirBaltic and Korean Air already are A220 customers.

Racer high-speed demonstrator passes preliminary design review milestone - Airbus,"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0xMC1yYWNlci1oaWdoLXNwZWVkLWRlbW9uc3RyYXRvci1wYXNzZXMtcHJlbGltaW5hcnktZGVzaWduLXJldmlld9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Amsterdam, 16th October 2018 - Airbus Helicopters continues to progress with the development of its Racer (Rapid And Cost-Efficient Rotorcraft) technology demonstrator, funded by European Union’s H2020 framework through the Clean Sky 2 program, and aiming to provide the best trade-off between speed, cost-efficiency, sustainability and mission performance.

After the validation of the demonstrator’s aerodynamic configuration last year, key subsystems have now successfully passed their preliminary design review (PDR) giving way to the launching of first components manufacture. Final assembly of the prototype is planned to start in Q4 2019.

“I want to thank all of our European partners for the excellence of their work and for their commitment in this fantastic project”, said Tomasz Krysinski, Head of Research & Innovation at Airbus Helicopters. “The PDR marks a major achievement for the Racer program as it allows to freeze interfaces and 3D definitions of the main subsystems, prior to detailed design and manufacture of key components.”

Long-lead items are the first ones to be manufactured. Airbus Helicopters teams already launched production of the lateral drive shaft, one of the Racer’s most innovative components. Among key subsystems, Italy’s Avio Aero, a GE Aviation Business, is launching procurement and manufacturing for the aircraft’s lateral gear boxes housing, while Hamble UK based GE Aviation Integrated Systems is taking care of the wing’s titanium cradle part. Romania’s INCAS/Romaero has already started manufacturing the Racer’s composite side panel and Spain’s Aernnova the tail parts primary structure.

Together with its partners, Airbus Helicopters is currently refining the content of the future Racer flight demonstration in Clean Sky 2 which will begin in 2020 and include about 200 flight hours. The first part will focus on the progressive opening of the flight envelope and on assessing key performance objectives as well as speed, handling qualities, stability and aerodynamics. The second phase will aim at demonstrating the aircraft’s suitability to carry out potential missions where increased speed and efficiency would bring significant added value, such as emergency medical services (EMS), search & rescue (SAR) and private transport. This second flight testing phase will also allow to mature low-noise flight procedures, unique to the Racer demonstrator formula.

This extension is valid for H145s delivered from January 2018.

Furthermore, Airbus has rolled out Helionix Step 3 on the H145, an enhanced version of Airbus’ Helionix avionics suite that enhances situational awareness, improves availability, accelerates helicopter connectivity, and reduces maintenance costs.

Compared with Helionix Step 2, Helionix Step 3 improves the situational awareness of pilots and flight crews, thanks to the new Synthetic Vision System which identifies obstacles. In addition, aeronautical objects like runways and helipads, and landscape elements such as urban areas, roads and railways, can now be spotted more easily by the crew, supporting safer operations.

Helionix also tracks the flight time, measuring the exact flight time between take-off and landing. Thanks to the exact tracking of the flight time, operators can fly up-to 20% longer in the same maintenance interval in comparison to a traditional flight tracking via pilot’s logbook. This leads to a reduction of direct maintenance costs of up to 6%.

The upgrade will also facilitate helicopter connectivity, allowing operators to broadcast their usage data while the helicopter is airborne via an optional communication server.

“The engine warranty extension coupled with the Helionix upgrade will offer greater value for customers by supporting safer operations and enabling operators to make use of the large quantities of data generated on each individual flight,” said Axel Humpert, Head of H145 programme at Airbus.

Helionix Step 3 is also available on the H175 and will soon be available on the H135.

The H145 is the market leader for police and rescue missions with a combined fleet of over 200 helicopters worldwide, which have jointly accumulated more than 100,000 flight hours.

REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/File Photo

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus won safety approval for the longest-range version of its A321neo jet as European and U.S. safety regulators both gave the green light to the A321LR, the planemaker said on Tuesday.

The announcement came as the original launch customer of the transatlantic-hopping jet, Primera Air, announced it was halting operations, leaving thousands of people stranded.

In April, Airbus had described Primera as the launch airline for the jet, which aims to extend the range of the best-selling A321neo to 4,000 nautical miles by adding a third optional extra fuel tank inside the cargo bay.

Airbus now plans to deliver the first A321LR aircraft to Israeli airline ARKIA, a spokesman said.

Industry sources said Primera had asked for its own first aircraft, to be rented from a leasing company, to be delayed as its financial difficulties mounted, leaving ARKIA first in line.

Airbus and Boeing have been adding more range to their single-aisle aircraft as airlines seek to open up new transatlantic or other routes using efficient narrowbody jets.

Airbus is working on a 4,500-nautical mile version dubbed A321XLR to try to head off plans by Boeing for a larger-cabin model wedged between single-aisle jets like the A321 and wide-body jets like the Boeing 787 or Airbus A330.

The chief executive of Norwegian Air (NWC.OL) said in June he was interested in the possible A321XLR version.

Airbus engineer applying MicroLink's advanced solar sheet arrays onto the Zephyr S wing surface. MicroLink's ELO-based IMM solar cell technology allows light weight, flexible, and very high efficiency solar sheets enabling the Zephyr to fly uninterrupted in the stratosphere.

The Zephyr platform is a new class of unmanned air vehicle that operates as a high-altitude pseudo-satellite (HAPS) enabling affordable, persistent, local satellite-like services. Running exclusively on solar power, the Zephyr aircraft holds world records for absolute endurance as well as altitude, flying at 70,000 feet or higher. This stratospheric platform can fly for months at a time and combines the persistence of a satellite with the flexibility of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). It is expected to be used in a wide range of emerging applications including maritime surveillance and services, border patrol missions, communications, forest fire detection and navigation.

MicroLink Devices provides a lightweight and flexible, high-efficiency solar sheet technology that is an enabling technology for electrically powered UAVs and satellites that have significant area and weight constraints. The combination of high-efficiency and low mass enabled by MicroLink's epitaxial lift-off (ELO) inverted metamorphic multi-junction (IMM) solar cells provides superior performance unmatched by any other solar cell technology. The latest generation of MicroLink solar sheets has specific powers exceeding 1,500 W/kg and areal powers greater than 350 W/m2. The development of MicroLink's ELO technology was sponsored over the past decade by numerous US agencies including NASA, DARPA, the Air Force Research Laboratory, the Office of Naval Research, NAVAIR, Army Research Office, Army REF, CERDEC, and the Department of Energy/NREL.

""We are very grateful to have had the opportunity over the past decade to participate in the Zephyr development effort,"" said Dr. Noren Pan, President and CEO of MicroLink Devices. ""The recent Zephyr flight is a remarkable accomplishment by Airbus and is an exciting beginning to a new stratospheric unmanned aircraft platform. It also represents the first long-endurance flight of a HAPS aircraft powered by ELO IMM solar cells and an important validation of this technology.""

Sophie Thomas, Airbus HAPS Program Director stated, ""Our collaboration with MicroLink Devices in the application of their ELO solar sheet technology to the Zephyr has been important to the success of the HAPS program. The high specific power of MicroLink's solar sheets enables the Zephyr to fly uninterrupted in the stratosphere which would not be possible with lower performance solar cell technology. This will further extend the capability and utility of the Zephyr platform for our customers.""

Airbus tests high altitude balloon for military communications - Aerospace Testing International,"Wed, 03 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZXJvc3BhY2V0ZXN0aW5naW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC5jb20vbmV3cy90ZWxlbWV0cnktY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnMvYWlyYnVzLXRlc3RzLWhpZ2gtYWx0aXR1ZGUtYmFsbG9vbi1mb3ItbWlsaXRhcnktY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus successfully flight tests stratospheric 4G/5G communications for defence applications on high-altitude balloon

Airbus launched the stratospheric balloon in Canada and flew it at altitudes up to 21km (13 miles) above Earth to create a high-altitude airborne cell site. The balloon carried the Airbus LTE AirNode communications equipment and created a 30km-wide (19 mile) footprint of coverage for private and secure communications.

The LTE AirNode system tested is a part of Network for the Sky (NFTS), Airbus’s program to develop a secure, networked airborne military communications platform.

The equipment could be used by other high-altitude platforms such as Airbus’s Zephyr to create persistent, secured communication cells that would relay information on a variety of different aircraft including helicopters and drones.

The Airbus test team, which was equipped with two vehicles and two drones, tracked the balloon over 200km (125 miles) as it flew through the air. While the team tracked the balloon, the engineers exchanged 4K video between the vehicles and drones, to simulate real-time transmission of data during a military mission. The data was sent via a private network at speeds from 0.5-4Mbps, which is comparable to 4G/5G mobile communication.

Airbus said that the communications capability will increase operational flexibility during air, ground or maritime-based military operations where operations require permanent connectivity. It added that the balloon and LTE AirNode system can stay airborne for several months at a time and could also be used to aid disaster relief scenarios.

The NFTS platform aims to combine different communication technologies to form one mesh network. Today, individual aircraft, UAVs and helicopters operate on separate networks with limited bandwidth and interoperability. NFTS will integrate satellite links with geostationary, medium- and low-Earth orbit constellations, tactical air-to-ground, ground-to-air and air-to-air links, voice links, 5G mobile communication cells and laser connections, into a single global secure network.

The NFTS program aims to offer a full operational capability by 2020 and is part of Airbus’s Future Air Power project for the European Future Combat Air System.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999783456325531}",neutral,0.999783456325531,0

Airbus Puts a Luxury Spin on VIP Helicopters - Robb Report,"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbW90b3JzL2F2aWF0aW9uL2FpcmJ1cy1sdXh1cnktdmlwLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLTI4MjI5NDkv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly9yb2JicmVwb3J0LmNvbS9tb3RvcnMvYXZpYXRpb24vYWlyYnVzLWx1eHVyeS12aXAtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtMjgyMjk0OS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If you’ve spent even just 30 minutes in a helicopter, you know two things: They are incredibly convenient, and they are both loud and uncomfortable. Airbus, Europe’s largest aerospace firm, is aiming to change the latter by giving private owners options for more style and grace.

A large portion of Airbus’s rotorcraft—helicopters, to you and me—are dedicated to rescue, utility, or transport missions, and while some are speedy, few are used for racing or recreation. In general, they’re purchased in a business-to-business context, with no differences for private and business buyers. Until now. With the introduction of the Airbus Corporate Helicopters (ACH) brand, corporate and private buyers can customize cabin interiors (and even exteriors to a degree). “ACH clients are neither providing a service nor generating revenues from the operations of their helicopter,” says Frederic Lemos, head of ACH. “[The new program] is consumer focused as opposed to the more traditional B2B. Luxury, quality, and amazing experiences are the result of special attention to each detail.”

Previously, Airbus Helicopters customers would pick a predesigned interior from a standard catalogue; but with ACH, the sky’s the limit. The new brand’s offerings are divided into three categories: Stylence, Exclusive, and Editions. Stylence is a prefab offering created by the company’s in-house team. Its aesthetic is inspired by lightweight sports cars, complete with a racing-stripe paint job and six leather-seat-and-carpet combos. Clients may add custom elements as they wish.

For the Exclusive line, the company rolls out its full bespoke capabilities, incorporating “a higher level of comfort, soundproofing, luxurious materials, and sophisticated design,” says Lemos. “We work on a ‘match to sample’ concept. [The client] can specify the brand and leather color reference they prefer or even provide us with a nonaeronautical material that we will match with an aeronautical material from our suppliers.”

One recent ACH client wanted his copter’s flooring to match the decking of his yacht. So the brand sourced a teakwood equivalent that replicated the look and thickness of the wood used on the yacht but was already approved for aeronautical use. Another client provided some Hermès leather to apply to specific parts of the cabin. And yet another outfitted his chopper with a precious clock.

ACH quality on displayBut not all of the upgrades in the ACH Exclusive line are solely aesthetic; models can also be equipped with better sound-proofing, double-glazed windows, electrical footsteps, reclining armchairs, ambient lighting, and Bluetooth.

The final category of Airbus’s new styles, ACH Editions, is reserved for special- edition helicopters created in collaboration with outside brands and designers. The first example of the concept is the ACH145 Mercedes-Benz Style, which features a distinctive silver-arrow paint job, a bolder, more aerodynamic-looking front end, and redesigned landing gear.

Airbus can give the ACH treatment to a range of helicopter models, including the ACH145, ACH130, ACH135, and the new ACH160, which is expected to begin deliveries next year. The new program is a natural outgrowth of the conglomerate’s Airbus Corporate Jets brand, which was founded in 1997 to provide the extra level of service demanded by business-jet clients. Now, with the debut of ACH, Airbus has become the only aircraft manufacturer with dedicated private and business brands for both jets and helicopters.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999823570251465}",neutral,0.9999823570251465,0
Airbus' Slowest-Selling Plane Finally Has a Customer (Again) - Yahoo Finance,"Sun, 21 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9haXJidXMtYXBvcy1zbG93ZXN0LXNlbGxpbmctcGxhbmUtMTM0MDAwNTMwLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In 2014, Airbus (NASDAQOTH: EADSY) made the unsurprising decision to update its strong-selling A330 widebody plane with new, more fuel-efficient engines. The A330neo competes directly with Boeing's (NYSE: BA) popular 787 Dreamliner family, but it was expected to lure customers through a combination of lower prices, better near-term availability, and significant commonality with the existing A330-200 and A330-300 models.

However, the A330neo has been a flop thus far. The smaller A330-800neo version has sold particularly poorly. In fact, Airbus didn't have any firm orders for the A330-800neo as of the end of last month.

An Airbus A330-800neo

The Airbus A330-800neo has sold extremely poorly. Image source: Airbus.

Last week, Airbus finally made some progress, signing a deal to sell eight A330-800neos to Kuwait Airways. Nevertheless, it has a long way to go to make the A330neo -- and especially the A330-800neo -- a viable competitor to the Boeing 787 family.

Low fuel prices and shaky economies undermined sales

Part of the A330neo's problem was simply bad timing. Airbus began taking orders in mid-2014. While Airbus got a good initial haul of orders, oil prices began to plunge in the second half of that year. The steep drop in fuel prices encouraged many airlines that had planned to upgrade to more fuel-efficient models to instead extend the lives of their existing aircraft to save money.

Recessions in previously fast-growing markets like Brazil and Russia -- and slower growth in other countries -- also hurt sales of the A330neo family.

Airbus recorded a respectable 154 net firm orders for the broader A330 family (including the A330neo) in 2014 and 136 net firm orders in 2015. However, net firm orders fell to 83 in 2016 and 21 in 2017. And as of September 30, Airbus had only booked eight net firm orders for the A330 aircraft family in 2018.

The lack of order activity has caused the A330 backlog to shrink significantly, particularly in the last two years. As of September 30, there were just 70 outstanding orders for the current-engine A330 models. Meanwhile, the A330neo had accumulated 224 firm orders -- not a very impressive total. As a result, Airbus plans to deliver just 50 A330s next year, down from more than 100 annually as recently as 2015.

Story continues

The A330-800neo hasn't found interest

While the A330 family, as a whole, has struggled to gain orders in recent years, the A330-800neo has been the worst of the bunch. Part of the problem is that its larger sibling -- the A330-900neo -- has significantly lower unit costs.

Airbus' few A330neo customers have almost all preferred the larger model. Image source: Airbus.

Indeed, much of the appeal of the A330-200 (the direct predecessor to the A330-800neo) was that it had significantly more range than the larger A330-300. However, Airbus steadily improved the A330-300 over time, increasing its range. The A330-900neo (its successor) actually has more range than the A330-200. A relatively small number of routes would require the additional range that the A330-800neo can provide. Few airlines are willing to take on the A330-800neo's higher unit costs just for that extra range.

In the first year or so that it was being sold, the A330-800neo accumulated 10 firm orders: six from Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ: HA) and four from Taiwan-based TransAsia Airways. However, TransAsia collapsed before it could take delivery of any A330-800neos. Meanwhile, Hawaiian Airlines got cold feet as Airbus failed to find additional buyers for the A330-800neo.

Ultimately, Hawaiian Holdings canceled its A330-800neo order earlier this year, placing a firm order for 10 Boeing 787-9s instead. While the A330-800neo would have meshed well with Hawaiian Airlines' existing fleet of 24 A330-200s, the carrier's management simply wasn't willing to take on the risk of owning an ""orphan"" aircraft.

Airbus finds a new buyer

The last-minute order cancellation by Hawaiian Airlines -- its first delivery was scheduled for 2019 -- left Airbus in an awkward spot. It had already built the A330-800neo test aircraft, but now it had no customers for the model.

Airbus finally secured a customer this past Monday, when it signed a purchase agreement for eight A330-800neos with Kuwait Airways. (It previously signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding for two A330-800neos with Uganda Airlines back in July.) The first delivery is scheduled for 2019, suggesting that the Kuwaiti flag carrier will take the aircraft that had been intended for Hawaiian Airlines .

The outlook still isn't good

Selling eight aircraft to Kuwait Airways and a pair to Uganda Airlines won't do much for Airbus' A330-800neo in the long run. Both orders are small and from low-profile airlines. Airbus would need a big order from one of the largest global airlines to get other carriers interested.

Unfortunately, the A330-800neo is already caught in a vicious cycle. The lack of orders makes airlines nervous that the model could be discontinued, hurting resale values and making it harder to find spare parts. Even American Airlines -- the world's largest airline and a major Airbus customer -- has said that it's not interested in the A330-800neo for that reason.

Making matters worse, Boeing is set to boost the 787 Dreamliner production rate from 12/month to 14/month in 2019. This -- combined with a slowdown in orders between 2014 and 2016 -- has greatly reduced the lead time for Dreamliner orders. Boeing also has become very aggressive on pricing recently. Both developments have removed key selling points for the A330neo family.

The A330-900neo may find some small measure of success. There's already a backlog of more than 200 orders, and A330 operators may find it easier to upgrade to the A330-900neo than to switch to the 787. But unless Airbus is willing to sell dozens of planes below cost to lure a big-name customer (and hopefully jump-start sales), the A330-800neo doesn't seem to have a long-term future.

The two delivered helicopters will be used to reinforce public security in Ceará State, as well as providing support for aeromedical operations in other regions of the state. Ciopaer’s fleet already includes two AS350s and four twin-engine helicopters of the H135 and the H145 family.

""The pilot's workload is facilitated by the stability of the aircraft, which helps to maintain a constant altitude,"" said Ciopaer's Lieutenant Colonel Marcus Costa. ""It can transport two pilots and five crewmembers, has flight autonomy of more than three hours and has special equipment such as a searchlight, electric winch, rescue kit and infrared camera.""

“These deliveries strengthen our partnership with the Government of Ceará and increases Ciopaer’s twin engine Airbus fleet, demonstrating the excellent cost-benefit of these models. We appreciate Ciopaer's confidence in our products and services,” said Richard Marelli, CEO of Helibras.

On top of the 4-axis autopilot, Helionix offers an innovative cockpit layout which helps to increase situational awareness. Designed with up to three large electronic displays on the H135, the cockpit is Night Vision Goggle compatible and includes a First Limit Indicator which highlights the appropriate engine instrument data for the pilot in one indicator.

The H135 family of helicopters are used by police forces all around the world, with more than 200 helicopters in-service in this segment. In addition to law enforcement, the H135 performs a wide range of missions including Emergency Medical Services (EMS), corporate transport and military training.

To date, more than 1,270 helicopters of the H135 family are in operation around the globe with more than 4.7 million flight hours.

Why the Airbus A350-900 ULR Is a Game Changer for Singapore Airlines - Business Insider,"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtdWxyLWdhbWUtY2hhbmdlci1mb3Itc2luZ2Fwb3JlLWFpcmxpbmVzLTIwMTgtMTDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This month, Singapore Airlines relaunched flagship non-stop service between Newark Liberty International Airport and its home base in Changi Airport in Singapore using its new Airbus A350-900 ULR jets. Now, passengers flying between the Big Apple and Lion City will no longer have to make a stop in Europe, cutting several hours off their trip.

The record-breaking flight covers more than 10,000 miles and can last up to 19 hours depending on conditions.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""It's a fantastic day for us to reinstate this service which is a flagship route in our network,"" Singapore Airlines senior vice president of sales and marketing, Campbell Wilson told Business Insider. ""The fact that it happens to be the longest is sort of immaterial to the fact that it's something our customers have long asked for and it really does provide a meaningful benefit to them with respect to time-saving and avoiding the inconvenience of transit.""

But for Singapore Airlines, the importance of the route reaches far beyond the news making nature of its duration.

In recent years, the airline's rivals have built up a really lucrative business by connecting South Asia and Southeast Asia with destinations in North America. Unfortunately, Singapore's geography has prevented the airline from effectively fighting back.

""One of the big constraints we have faced being based in Southeast Asia and trying to serve North America is that because of the technical inability to fly nonstop, we have had to have an intermediate (transit) point,"" Wilson said.

For example, Singapore's service to JFK International Airport stops in Frankfurt, Germany before continuing on to New York.

These fifth freedom routes are a rarity because it involves Singapore Airlines selling tickets on flights between two foreign countries. In this case, the US and Germany.

(A fifth freedom flight is an airline's service between two foreign countries that either begins or ends in a third country.)

Countries tend to be very restrictive when it comes to allowing an interloper to do business on routes operated by their own airlines, limiting Singapore's ability to grow its service to North America.

""Countries quite jealously guard the rights from their hubs, so at best we can fly daily on these fifth freedom legs,"" the veteran airline executive explained.

Airbus

And that's where the new Airbus jet comes back into the picture.

""The ULR changes the game in the sense that we no are now no longer constrained these fifth freedom limitations,"" Wilson told us.

Singapore Airlines previously operated non-stop service to Newark from 2004 until 2013 using the Airbus A340-500. But high fuel prices and inefficient aircraft made the flight economically unfeasible.

""The A340-500 is a four-engined aircraft designed in the 90s and purchased when fuel was $19 a barrel but when fuel increased $119 a barrel the technological limitations of that time was exposed,"" Wilson explained. ""So we said to Airbus if you build an aircraft that is modern generation and can operate the route economically, we'll take it.""

The result is the A350-900 ULR or ultra long range.

""The trigger to re-introducing this flight was the availability of this aircraft,"" Wilson added. ""It is the only one that is, in our view, capable of doing this mission economically.""

Singapore is the only carrier in the world with these special aircraft. It's based on the ultra-modern A350-900, but modified to carry an additional 6,300 gallons of fuel. This increases the aircraft's range from 9,300 miles to 11,100 miles and allows Singapore to comfortably fly non-stop to North America with a full load of 161 passengers and cargo.

According to Wilson, who previously served as the CEO of Scoot, Singapore's low-cost long-haul airline, The ULR's ultra-efficient engines and aerodynamics help it deliver 25% less fuel compared to the previous one.

""With fuel being 30% to 40% of an airline's costs, those are significant savings especially on such a route where you are consuming a lot of fuel and you are burning fuel and carrying fuel for the last part of the trip,"" Wilson said.

The Newark/New York flight is just the first in a series of new routes Singapore plans to launch to North America using the ULR. In fact, non-stop service to Los Angeles and San Francisco are expected to launch in November.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7087200284004211}",positive,0.7087200284004211,1

The European aircraft maker’s board picked insider Guillaume Faury to replace CEO Tom Enders in April.

The 50-year-old Faury currently serves as president of Airbus’ commercial aircraft division. He was CEO of Airbus Helicopters from 2013 until February 2018.

Board Chairman Denis Ranque praised Faury’s “global outlook, extensive operational experience, strong personal values and straightforward leadership style” in a statement. Enders has been the CEO of Airbus since May 2012. The 59-year-old announced last December he planned to step down.

Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus, said: “Guillaume is an excellent choice. He has gained broad industrial and aeronautic experience over many years and in many roles both inside and outside Airbus. With his strong values and international mindset, Guillaume stands for the new generation of leaders that Airbus needs for the coming decade. He knows he can rely on me to facilitate a smooth transition.”

Before taking charge of Airbus’ Commercial Aircraft division in February 2018, Faury led the company’s helicopter business. He also did tours as a senior manager at Peugeot and Eurocopter.

“I am honored to have been selected by the Board to lead this extraordinary company. I look forward to taking on this new challenge with passion and enthusiasm, relying on the exceptional expertise and engagement of all Airbus people around the world,” said Guillaume Faury.

Airbus (EADSF) has had a strong run this year, with its stock up 25% since January. But the company is facing challenges that will require the licensed flight test engineer to quickly get up to speed.

Airbus, which is based in Toulouse, France, dominates the commercial aircraft market along with rival Boeing. It delivered a record 718 aircraft in 2017 and employs 129,000 staff worldwide.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9998939037322998}",positive,0.9998939037322998,1
Airbus reportedly faces new jet delays at Hamburg plant - CNBC,"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTgvMTAvMjMvYWlyYnVzLXJlcG9ydGVkbHktZmFjZXMtbmV3LWpldC1kZWxheXMtYXQtaGFtYnVyZy1wbGFudC5odG1s0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMTgvMTAvMjMvYWlyYnVzLXJlcG9ydGVkbHktZmFjZXMtbmV3LWpldC1kZWxheXMtYXQtaGFtYnVyZy1wbGFudC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An Airbus A321 narrow-body twin-engine passenger jet airliner on the Airbus SE fuselage assembly line in Hamburg, Germany.

For two years Airbus faced a shortage of engines and had to slow jet deliveries. Now engines are arriving fast - but fresh snags mean a Hamburg plant that assembles best-selling jets is having trouble absorbing them, industry sources said.

The internal snags have exacerbated delivery delays that leave Airbus with the challenge of delivering 76 single-aisle planes per month in the last quarter, according to consultants Flight Ascend, 9.6 percent more than its previous record.

Airbus is working flat out to maintain this year's target of 800 total aircraft deliveries needed to meet financial goals andsingle-aisle assembly lines are its most important cash cow.

""They're late; everyone is mad at them. They've been hiding behind the engine problems,"" a senior aircraft buyer said, referring to the tendency of supply chains to focus on the most visible laggards without always tackling problems in waiting.

Other industry sources say Hamburg may not be the immediate source of the problem, but that this facility has felt the worst impact in Airbus's global jigsaw of assembly plants because it is introducing a new version of A321 just as production is running faster than ever.

That illustrates a wider challenge as planemakers struggle to introduce new models and fix technical issues without pausing record output increases a task some compare to taking the steepest hill in a cycle race at a sprint while fixing a tire.

Deliveries of the A321, a large single-aisle jet mainly made in Germany, spiked higher in May as delayed engines started coming in but slowed down again in September, Airbus data shows.

Now, Airbus is introducing a new A321neo ACF version, which offers more flexible cabins but requires complex configuration.

One of the sources said the Hamburg assembly plant was facing some problems with cabling the jets, stirring memories of cabling problems which plagued the A380 superjumbo a decade ago.

An Airbus spokesman confirmed the customized new A321neo version had ""led to some rescheduling of aircraft deliveries,""

in combination with pressure from output increases and the queue of jets still waiting to be delivered from the engine crisis.

Quality problems in Hamburg have also contributed to delays, Reuters reported last month.

Oil price squeeze

Despite disruption, Airbus has said it is confident it will meet single-aisle production goals of 60 a month spread across all its factories in mid-2019, up from around 55 now.

Sources say Airbus is also preparing to make capacity of 65 single-aisle jets a month available by the end of next year, though there has been no decision on whether to implement this.

Ultimately, Airbus aims to raise output as high as 70-73 to serve record travel demand and the company says planes offering premium seats like the A321neo ACF will help to drive this.

Still, delays at Hamburg are a headache for new sales chief Christian Scherer as airlines wait for deliveries.

For many airlines, the financial pain is acute since oil prices have bounced back to $80 dollars: exactly the market the A321neo and similar fuel-saving models were designed for.

""Airlines can deal with planes that are off-spec but not ones that are late. They have built a network plan which takes account of new aircraft in the fleet,"" Ascend chief consultant Rob Morris said. Boeing has also had some delays.

Hamburg's woes highlight the operational issues at stake as planemaking chief Guillaume Faury prepares to become chief executive in April. His two main industrial lieutenants, Tom Williams and Didier Evrard, retire at end-year.

Insiders say Faury, who has made production the ""priority of priorities"" for this quarter, will not be replaced as president of commercial jets but may appoint an operations leader.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9999853372573853}",negative,0.9999853372573853,-1

The Middle Eastern airline is the exclusive global launch customer of the new Airbus A350-1000 plane, which took its first flights on the Doha-London route in February. Now the aircraft is expanding its reach, beginning journeys from New York on October 28. It’s the first time the plane will fly to and from the United States.

The new airbus is 23 feet longer than the A350-900 (for which Qatar Airways was also the launch customer), and its features include full-mood LED light settings to minimize jet lag and eight adjustable cabin temperature zones to offer more precise control over the air throughout the plane. It also provides even more seats in its QSuite Business Class cabin—Qatar Airways became the first and only airline to offer a double bed in Business Class when it took its first flight with QSuite to London in June 2017 (it quickly took on other international routes).

The larger plane also allows for a two-class Business cabin, composed of 46 seats in a 1-2-1 configuration. All of the seats have a “suite” feature, with closing doors, but the middle seats convert into double beds and have open-suite features (if you’re that rare person who doesn’t mind human contact on a flight).

For those traveling on business trips and family getaways, the setup is ideal. The center four seats have adjustable panels and moveable television monitors (with more than 4,000 entertainment options), so flyers can transform the space into an open area for co-working or just decompressing over cocktails. And when you’ve had enough of your suite mates, you can turn it right back into a private suite.

As with all of Qatar Airways’ QSuite cabins, the 79-inch-long, 21.5-inch-wide beds lie flat at 180 degrees, and their fabrics are burgundy and gray with rose gold details (a true #luxury signifier). Passengers can turn on the Do Not Disturb sign for total en-route peace, and the suites are equipped with BRIC amenity kits with Castello Monte Vibiano skincare products, as well as sleepwear from The White Company for overnight flights.

As for the price of all this in-air luxury? It’s expected to be around the same cost as the current round-trip QSuite flights from New York to Doha, which is in the $9,000 to $11,000 range—but if you’re flying during a particularly busy time, individual flights can cost as much as $7,000 each way.

Perhaps it’s time to start saving.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999867677688599}",neutral,0.9999867677688599,0

Engineers and manufacturing specialists from TE Connectivity and Airbus developed the customized label sheets over six months for the A319, A320 and A380. Each individual sheet design contains a complete shipset of labels for a specific subsystem.

The labels are a highly customized version of TE Connectivity’s HPR100 labels, which are designed to stay in place and legible for decades regardless of extreme temperatures and exposure to aviation fluids such as Skydrol, jet fuel, water and aggressive cleaning fluids. A typical aircraft requires around 400 individual labels in its wings and engine assemblies.

Airframers: Boeing mid-market type by 2019; Airbus deliveries solid | CAPA - CAPA - Centre for Aviation,"Mon, 29 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vY2VudHJlZm9yYXZpYXRpb24uY29tL2FuYWx5c2lzL3JlcG9ydHMvYWlyZnJhbWVycy1ib2VpbmctbWlkLW1hcmtldC10eXBlLWJ5LTIwMTktYWlyYnVzLWRlbGl2ZXJpZXMtc29saWQtNDQ0NjAy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

Boeing sticks to its message about rendering a decision on its middle of the market aircraft by early 2019.

Deliveries of higher gauge single aisle aircraft by Airbus continue to grow.

Boeing remains confident of gaining approval for its proposed JV with Embraer, but it remains to be seen how Brazil's leading candidate will view the proposed tie-up.

Boeing's now consistent message: mid-market decision will come in early 2019

Boeing has, for more than two years, been discussing a possible middle of the market aircraft to replace older 757s and 767s and Delta Air Lines has expressed an interest in becoming the launch customer for the aircraft.

Now that Airbus has taken a stake in the CSeries, Delta's order book has tilted heavily toward Airbus, with the European manufacturer representing 86% of the airline's aircraft on order. (That includes 75 Airbus A220-100s, a type that was formally the Bombardier CS100)

US widebody aircraft market: Boeing's upper hand in aircraft orders



Speaking at the recent CAPA Latin America Aviation and LCCs Summit, Boeing Managing Director of Marketing James McBride stated that the company was continuing to study a middle of the market aircraft and hopes to make a decision early next year. Mr McBride said Boeing has discussed the potential new aircraft with 60 customers worldwide.

What's set to cause the next wave of disruption on North-South markets?

Mr McBride concluded ""we've almost gotten to the limit"" of current generation single aisle aircraft. ""The engines want to get bigger and the fuselages want to grow"", he stated.

Boeing could bring new wing technology to the marketplace to produce an aircraft with a range of 5000nm, which is critical for some of the large North America-South America markets. He also explained that Boeing believed it could bring CASM down significantly on some of the larger flow markets between those two regions with a family of aircraft featuring up to 270 seats.



While Boeing remains excited about the opportunity for a middle of the market aircraft, ""there's still some due diligence to do"", said Mr McBride.

Airbus: the major trend of upgauging continues worldwide

Airbus won a key victory earlier in 2018 when JetBlue and the US start-up Moxy ordered the A220.



Bombardier has always faced challenges in Latin American sales, given that Brazil is home to its rival Embraer. During the Summit Airbus VP of Marketing Latin America & Caribbean Paul Moultrie was asked about the A220's prospects in the region. He remarked that the A220 provides operators an opportunity to develop thinner routes, and the general trend in Latin America is operators opting to upgauge from A320s to A321s, given the congestion and constraints.



He acknowledged that Bombardier had not had a lot of success in the region with the CSeries (now the A220), but stressed that was not because of the aircraft itself, but stemmed more from questions regarding the support network Bombardier could offer for the aircraft.



With the CSeries, Airbus is rounding out its narrowbody aircraft portfolio; however, the airframer continues to receive meaningful orders for upgauging in its narrowbody products. Mr Moultrie stated that five years ago 2% of single aisle aircraft delivered in Latin America were A321s; by 2016 A321s represented 45% of deliveries.



He said that upgauging is the trend among airlines worldwide, citing the US as an example where Airbus has sold more A321neos than A320neos. Mr Moultrie also highlighted that five years ago there were zero A320s delivered with more than 180 seats. By 2020, approximately 50% of A320 narrowbodies delivered will feature 180 seats or more.



Stage lengths of narrowbody jets also continue to grow. Mr Moultrie remarked that during the past five years the number of routes operated with A321s longer than 2000nm had grown by a factor of four.

Boeing remains confident of gaining approval for its proposed JV with Embraer

Mr McBride stated that Boeing was optimistic the deal would gain approval, and Boeing and Embraer were planning integration activities.



Mr McBride stated that there were opportunities to bring in Embraer's Lean design - which the Brazilian manufacturer is ""very good at"" - and working at vertical integration.

Boeing Managing Director of Marketing James McBride says Embraer is ""very good at"" the Lean design

Brazil has, on 29-Oct-2018, elected a far right candidate in Jair Bolsonaro. It is yet be seen how an administration of Mr Bolsonaro will view the potential tie-up but many investors hope he will steer Brazil into more business friendly policies - at least in the case of the Boeing-Embraer tie-up.

However, it cannot be certain yet just how a president with an overtly nationalist bent would view Boeing's involvement.

Airbus and Boeing work to ensure that their product portfolios remain competitive

Airbus and Boeing have made major moves during the past year to invest in smaller rivals in order to ensure that the larger companies maintain competitive aircraft portfolios.

Bombardier has already gained some major wins from Airbus loyalists, and Boeing believes it can gain some manufacturing efficiencies from Embraer while ensuring it remains competitive with Airbus in the small narrowbody aircraft segment.



As Boeing pursues its JV with Embraer, it is also on the cusp of making a key decision regarding the 757/767 replacement, and operators worldwide are watching the outcome.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7687300443649292}",neutral,0.7687300443649292,0

Qatar Airways Tweaks Airbus Order to Get More A350-1000 Jets - Fortune,"Mon, 01 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAxOC8xMC8wMS9xYXRhci1haXJ3YXlzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLTEwMDAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus (EADSY) will be delivering more extra-large A350 airliners to Qatar Airways, after the carrier changed its order.

Qatar Airways was the first carrier to fly the A350-900 when it was launched a few years ago, and the first to fly the larger A350-1000 earlier this year. Now, with three of the larger plane in its fleet, it has asked for five more A350-1000s in place of five A350-900s that were on order.

“Since taking delivery of the world’s first A350-1000 in February 2018, we have been extremely pleased with the aircraft’s performance, which has prompted us to update our original order,” said Qatar Airways Group CEO Akbar Al Baker. “The A350-1000 has been a welcome addition to our fleet and very well received by our passengers who enjoy the unprecedented levels of comfort and technology that this new generation aircraft offers.”

The A350-1000 is 23 feet longer than the A350-900, and it offers 28% more capacity in the Premium class cabin. Crucially, the newer model also uses Rolls-Royce’s new Trent XWP-97 engines, which is supposed to offer unprecedented fuel efficiency.

That fuel efficiency could come in handy for Qatar Airways, which is being forced to fly longer routes due to a regional political dispute. Because Qatar is currently a pariah among neighbors including Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain, its state airline cannot use those countries’ airspace.

“We are pleased the A350-1000 delivers to [Qatar Airways’] expectations, being the aircraft of choice to seamlessly increase capacity in unprecedented comfort on its growing long-haul routes,” said Airbus commercial aircraft chief Guillaume Faury.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999992847442627}",positive,0.9999992847442627,1

Following the delivery of its first Airbus A220-100 last week, Delta Air Lines shared a sneak peek of the new aircraft's spacious (for a regional jet) interior- including an unsual lavatory with a window.

The carrier says that the new A220 ""will bring elements of the international travel experience that customers have enjoyed on widebody aircraft to domestic routes for customers to enjoy at home.""

That seems like a stretch for a 109-seat regional jet, but who knows? I look forward to trying one out when they take off this winter. Inaugural A220 flights are set to depart on Jan. 31, from Delta's hub at New York's LaGuardia airport to Boston Logan International and Dallas-Ft Worth.

Check out the slideshow at the top of this post for a full look at the new plane-- including the window located in one of the jet's two rear lavatories.

Regrettably, Delta has no current plans to bring them to the west coast, but time will tell...

At first glance the new plane reminds me of Embraer's spacious ""E-jet"" regional jets, which have thankfully been replacing those awful Canadair RJs still flown by a handful of carriers on low-volume routes.

Highlights of Delta's A220-100 include:

>109 seats total, including seating for 12 in First Class, 15 in Delta Comfort+ and 82 in Main Cabin

>Seat-back entertainment screens, in-seat power

>Satellite Wi-Fi

>Among the widest economy seats of any narrowbody aircraft (nearly 19 inches across- the widest in Delta's fleet) configured 5-abreast (2-3)

>A new first class seat (configured 2-2) with what Delta says is the largest seatback screen in its fleet.

>High-capacity overhead bins

>Extra-large windows

>LED mood lighting

JetBlue recently announced that it would buy up to 60 of these new jets, too. (Read about that here)

If ""A220"" sounds strange to you, it's because that model number has only been around for a few months. In case you missed it, Airbus recently closed a deal to acquire a majority stake in the newest line of planes being built by the Canadian regional jet manufacturer Bombardier. They were known as the ""CS"" series – the CS100 and CS300.

Last summer, Airbus pulled rank as the new majority owner and renamed those two models. The 110-seat CS100 became the A220-200 and the 130-seat CS300 is now the A220-300. (Delta has a two-year-old order in place for 75 CS100s, now A220-200s.)

H225M soars past the 100000 flight hour milestone - Airbus,"Thu, 04 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0xMC1oMjI1bS1zb2Fycy1wYXN0LXRoZS0xMDAwMDAtZmxpZ2h0LWhvdXItbWlsZXN0b25l0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Marignane, 04 October, 2018 - The H225M, with 88 aircraft currently in service in six countries across the globe, has surpassed the 100,000 flight hour milestone, following its first delivery to the French Air Force in 2006. The aircraft was rapidly deployed by the French Air Force in Lebanon in 2006 where the H225M, also known as the Caracal, successfully evacuated around 300 people. Since then the 11-metric-tonne H225M has proven its reliability and durability in combat conditions and crisis areas such as Afghanistan, Chad, the Ivory Coast, the Central African Republic, and Mali, while also supporting NATO-led operations in Libya.

“We are thrilled to see that the H225M has achieved this symbolic milestone with helicopters flying in different corners of the globe and in some of the harshest theatres of operation” said Michel Macia, Head of Super Puma programme at Airbus Helicopters. “Its state-of-the art avionics and world renowned four axis autopilot, its exceptional range and payload capacities, combined with a large cabin designed to carry 28 troops and powerful air-toground and air-to-surface armament and electronic warfare system allow the H225M operators to carry out the most demanding missions” he added.

Operating both from ships and from land, even in icing conditions, this helicopter has an allweather capability supported by night vision goggle compatibility. The helicopter’s outstanding 1,296 km range can be extended with air-to-air refueling capabilities, allowing for flight times of up to 10 hours, as demonstrated recently by the French Air Force in operational conditions.

The H225M, a member of the Super Puma family, is relied upon as a force multiplier by France, Brazil, Mexico, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. The Royal Thai Air Force has recently renewed its trust in the aircraft with a follow-on order of four aircraft for combat search and rescue and troop transport missions. Other recent customers for the H225M include Kuwait who signed a contract in 2016 for 30 aircraft and Singapore. The H225M continues to attract interest from governments worldwide as a powerful multi-role aircraft capable of meeting their operational needs.

Airbus lines up date for A330-800 first flight - SamChui.com - Sam Chui,"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vc2FtY2h1aS5jb20vMjAxOC8xMC8zMS9haXJidXMtbGluZXMtdXAtZGF0ZS1mb3ItYTMzMC04MDAtZmlyc3QtZmxpZ2h0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus lines up date for A330-800 first flight

The week starting the 5th of November is the week Airbus has announced it intends to perform the first flight for the A330-800neo.

Airbus only recently installed the two Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines to the first aircraft – MSN 1888 – which wears registration F-WTTO. Since then, the aircraft has had its engines powered up and tested as well as having conducted various ground tests such as rejected takeoffs, brake tests and flight system verification.

The image below from Eurospot on Flickr was taken during the first startup of the engines:

Since the larger A330-900 was used to complete the majority of the heavy tests, the A330-800 will only have to perform roughly 300h of flight testing. This is subject to change as weather patterns and operational requirements play a role in the flying schedule.

With a typical seating of 257, the Airbus A330-800 has a range of 15,094 km (8150nm), compared to its previous generation model, the A330-200, which has a typical seating capacity of 247 with a range of 13,450km (7250nm).

Airbus increased the capacity of the aircraft by optimizing the cabin layout, which is based off the Airspace design.

No firm orders exist within the A330-800s order book, only commitments, with Kuwait Airways signing for eight, which you can read about here. Airbus is hoping that by progressing with the flight test campaign, they can get some firm orders and some more customers.

Why does the A330-800 have no orders in the first place?

Put simply, the majority of A330s flying today are all relatively young and still worthy of keeping. If an airline wants more, they can order more cheaply and quickly. Because of this, no airline is in a rush to buy the A330neo. Additionally, the fierce competition from the Boeing 787 is putting Airbus in a tricky position.

There has been some hesitation as to whether the A330neo will bring grief to airlines as the engines fitted are related to the Trent 1000 engines that have caused the groundings of 787 fleets worldwide. Airbus and Rolls-Royce have stepped in stating none of theses issues will carry over, however production issues have struck and Airbus has had to adjust A330-900 deliveries due to Rolls-Royce’s delivery plans.

TAP will receive their first A330-900 in the very near future and will accept additional aircraft on the production line once they have engines. Airbus is confident TAP will be pleased by the entry into service.

As for the first flight of the A330-800, further information regarding exact times will be announced by Airbus, including any announcement of cancellation should the weather overwhelm them or the unlikely case of a problem.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999988317489624}",neutral,0.999988317489624,0
Airbus Puts a Luxury Spin on VIP Helicopters - Yahoo Life,"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvYWlyYnVzLXB1dHMtbHV4dXJ5LXNwaW4tdmlwLTE2MDAzMTc0MS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If you’ve spent even just 30 minutes in a helicopter, you know two things: They are incredibly convenient, and they are both loud and uncomfortable. Airbus, Europe’s largest aerospace firm, is aiming to change the latter by giving private owners options for more style and grace.

A large portion of Airbus’s rotorcraft—helicopters, to you and me—are dedicated to rescue, utility, or transport missions, and while some are speedy, few are used for racing or recreation. In general, they’re purchased in a business-to-business context, with no differences for private and business buyers. Until now. With the introduction of the Airbus Corporate Helicopters (ACH) brand, corporate and private buyers can customize cabin interiors (and even exteriors to a degree). “ACH clients are neither providing a service nor generating revenues from the operations of their helicopter,” says Frederic Lemos, head of ACH. “[The new program] is consumer focused as opposed to the more traditional B2B. Luxury, quality, and amazing experiences are the result of special attention to each detail.”

Previously, Airbus Helicopters customers would pick a predesigned interior from a standard catalogue; but with ACH, the sky’s the limit. The new brand’s offerings are divided into three categories: Stylence, Exclusive, and Editions. Stylence is a prefab offering created by the company’s in-house team. Its aesthetic is inspired by lightweight sports cars, complete with a racing-stripe paint job and six leather-seat-and-carpet combos. Clients may add custom elements as they wish.

For the Exclusive line, the company rolls out its full bespoke capabilities, incorporating “a higher level of comfort, soundproofing, luxurious materials, and sophisticated design,” says Lemos. “We work on a ‘match to sample’ concept. [The client] can specify the brand and leather color reference they prefer or even provide us with a nonaeronautical material that we will match with an aeronautical material from our suppliers.”

One recent ACH client wanted his copter’s flooring to match the decking of his yacht. So the brand sourced a teakwood equivalent that replicated the look and thickness of the wood used on the yacht but was already approved for aeronautical use. Another client provided some Hermès leather to apply to specific parts of the cabin. And yet another outfitted his chopper with a precious clock.

ACH quality on displayBut not all of the upgrades in the ACH Exclusive line are solely aesthetic; models can also be equipped with better sound-proofing, double-glazed windows, electrical footsteps, reclining armchairs, ambient lighting, and Bluetooth.

The final category of Airbus’s new styles, ACH Editions, is reserved for special- edition helicopters created in collaboration with outside brands and designers. The first example of the concept is the ACH145 Mercedes-Benz Style, which features a distinctive silver-arrow paint job, a bolder, more aerodynamic-looking front end, and redesigned landing gear.

Airbus can give the ACH treatment to a range of helicopter models, including the ACH145, ACH130, ACH135, and the new ACH160, which is expected to begin deliveries next year. The new program is a natural outgrowth of the conglomerate’s Airbus Corporate Jets brand, which was founded in 1997 to provide the extra level of service demanded by business-jet clients. Now, with the debut of ACH, Airbus has become the only aircraft manufacturer with dedicated private and business brands for both jets and helicopters.

Another 5 aircraft will follow by the end of 2020.

""Lufthansa CityLine has been handling an important part of our feeder traffic at the hubs in Munich and Frankfurt for many years,"" says Wilken Bormann, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Lufthansa CityLine and CEO of Lufthansa Hub Munich. ""Entering the A320 segment is a logical next step. With the new collective agreement, both negotiating partners have illustrated their will to jointly develop Lufthansa CityLine as a key component of the Lufthansa Group.""

The parties have agreed on an extensive package. It includes, among other things, a moderate salary increase for the next three years and a growth-related increase for 2021. Essential points of the structure of the company pension plan will be adapted to the regulations for Lufthansa’s mainline staff. Another key aspect is the optimization of the training roadmap for its pilots. The package thus opens up important new growth prospects.

Lufthansa CityLine is a wholly owned subsidiary of Deutsche Lufthansa AG and a specialist in hub traffic at the two hubs of Frankfurt and Munich. Every year, the airline welcomes around eight million passengers aboard its roughly 50 aircraft. The fleet takes off to around 80 airports in over 24 countries more than 300 times a day. Lufthansa CityLine employs about 2,200 people.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999473094940186}",neutral,0.9999473094940186,0

China Airlines has received their 14th and final Airbus A350-900 within their order for the type.

MSN 239, registered as B-18918, features a special livery that combines the carbon fiber patter seen on one of Airbus’ test aircraft with the colors of China Airlines.

Additionally, the two 18s seen in the registration is very auspicious for good fortune and is quite common for airlines within the region.

Although this is the last Airbus A350 on order by the airline, a further six options are available to be taken up. Talks for a top-up order have also been mentioned in recent times, with the Airbus A350-1000 being looked at. The airline states the aircraft has a very comparable passenger capacity to the Boeing 777-300ER, which is good because with the rising fuel prices, new aircraft will have to be considered.

Airbus has outlined the key features and network of China Airlines‘ A350-900 fleet in the following infographic:

China Airlines has their Airbus A350-900s configured in a three-class configuration, with 32 flat bed seats in Premium Business, 31 recliner seats in Premium Economy and 243 standard seats in Economy, totaling 306 seats on board the aircraft.

Business class seats all have direct aisle access with a side table. As mentioned above, each seat can be converted into a flat bed which extends 1.9 meters. An 18 inch entertainment screen is fitted, with access to USB and AC charging ports as well as the in flight Wi-Fi whoch spans the entire aircraft.

Premium Economy is a little less advanced with the seat layout configured as 2-3-2. Each seat has a pitch of 39 inches and a width of 20 inches. Economy is pretty standard with a 3-3-3 configuration. The entertainment is a little smaller but still offers USB charging as well as AC-power.

The aircraft fly to destinations within Europe, North America, as well as some key cities in the Asia-Pacific region. New routes such as Milan and Prague are being developed and will be launched as early as late-2019.

Since the launch of the A350, Airbus has logged a total of 890 firm orders from 46 customers. The Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines that power the A350 family have been performing to specification, with airlines praising the efficiency and reliability of the type.

Various improvements have been made since launch, including aerodynamic upgrades to the wings by using taller winglets and adjusted flap fairings as well as reducing the number of layers that create the wing itself. Higher maximum takeoff weight variants have become available, allowing the aircraft to carry more payload or fly further, as seen in the A350-900ULR.

Singapore Airlines has ushered in a new generation of long-haul travel with its first A350-900 Ultra Long Range (ULR), which is now being operated on the world’s longest commercial route – Singapore-New York – covering a distance of nearly 9,000 nautical miles.

The A350-900ULR’s extended range is up to 9,700 nautical miles (18,000 km.), incorporating a modified fuel system that increases the aircraft’s fuel carrying capacity by 24,000 litres without the need for additional fuel tanks.

Singapore Airlines has ordered seven A350-900ULRs, which also will be deployed on non-stop routes from Singapore to Los Angeles and San Francisco. These aircraft will join the carrier’s growing fleet of A350 XWBs, which are used primarily on long-haul flights.

A better experience for passengers and crew alike

With a maximum take-off weight (MTOW) of 280 tonnes, the A350-900ULR is capable of flying over 20 hours non-stop, combining the highest levels of passenger and crew comfort (including an additional rest area for cockpit and cabin crews) with unbeatable economics for such distances.

As with the other models in the A350 XWB Family, A350-900ULR has a wide cabin with more personal space and the quietest interior noise levels of any twin-aisle jetliner. In addition, the cabin altitude is optimised at the equivalent of 1,800 metres above sea level (25 percent less than in aluminium-fuselage aircraft). This, combined with the latest draft-free air conditioning system, leads to a less dry cabin environment and reduces passenger fatigue.

The A350 XWB also features an advanced temperature management system that allows settings to be controlled more precisely by zones in the cabin and crew areas. And a state-of-the-art ambient LED lighting system capable of producing over 16 million colour combinations enables realistic simulations of different times of the day, such as sunrise or sunset, helping passengers to acclimatise to different time zones.

A platform for success

Airbus’ Ultra Long Range A350 XWB builds on the success of its A350 XWB – the newest and most modern widebody aircraft family, incorporating the latest aerodynamic design, carbon fibre fuselage and wings, plus fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce engines. Together, these latest technologies translate into unrivalled levels of operational efficiency, with a 25 per cent reduction in fuel consumption and emissions, and significantly lower maintenance costs.

The A350 XWB features the Airspace by Airbus cabin, which brings enhanced comfort and well-being on long flights. The aircraft has the quietest cabin of any twin-aisle widebody and features the latest environmental control and mood lighting systems, as well as the latest in-flight entertainment and Wi-Fi systems.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.729515552520752}",neutral,0.729515552520752,0

Exclusive: Airbus faces new jet delays at Hamburg plant - sources - Yahoo Finance,"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9leGNsdXNpdmUtYWlyYnVzLWZhY2VzLWpldC1kZWxheXMtaGFtYnVyZy1wbGFudC1zb3VyY2VzLTExMTg1ODYxMC0tc2VjdG9yLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FILE PHOTO: General view in a new A320 production line at the Airbus plant in Hamburg, Germany, June 14, 2018.

By Tim Hepher

PARIS (Reuters) - For two years Airbus faced a shortage of engines and had to slow jet deliveries. Now engines are arriving fast - but snags at a Hamburg plant where Airbus assembles best-selling jets is having trouble absorbing them, industry sources said.

The internal snags have exacerbated delivery delays that leave Airbus with the challenge of delivering 76 single-aisle planes per month in the last quarter, according to consultants Flight Ascend, 9.6 percent more than its previous record.

Airbus is working flat out to maintain this year's target of 800 total aircraft deliveries needed to meet financial goals and single-aisle assembly lines are its most important cash cow.

""They're late; everyone is mad at them. They've been hiding behind the engine problems,"" a senior aircraft buyer said, referring to the tendency of supply chains to focus on the most visible laggards without always tackling problems in waiting.

Other industry sources say Hamburg may not be the immediate source of the problem, but that this facility has felt the worst impact in Airbus's global jigsaw of assembly plants because it is introducing a new version of A321 just as production is running faster than ever.

That illustrates a wider challenge as planemakers struggle to introduce new models and fix technical issues without pausing record output increases – a task some compare to taking the steepest hill in a cycle race at a sprint while fixing a tyre.

Deliveries of the A321, a large single-aisle jet mainly made in Germany, spiked higher in May as delayed engines started coming in but slowed down again in September, Airbus data shows.

Now, Airbus is introducing a new A321neo ACF version, which offers more flexible cabins but requires complex configuration.

One of the sources said the Hamburg assembly plant was facing some problems with cabling the jets, stirring memories of cabling problems which plagued the A380 superjumbo a decade ago.

Story continues

Airbus had no immediate comment.

The ramp-up has also increased quality problems, leading to more delays and a queue of undelivered jets, Reuters reported last month.

OIL PRICE SQUEEZE

Despite disruption, Airbus has said it is confident it will meet single-aisle production goals of 60 a month spread across all its factories in mid-2019, up from around 55 now.

Sources say Airbus is also preparing to make capacity of 65 single-aisle jets a month available by the end of next year, though there has been no decision on whether to implement this.

Ultimately, Airbus aims to raise output as high as 70-73 to serve record travel demand and the company says planes offering premium seats like the A321neo ACF will help to drive this.

Still, delays at Hamburg are a headache for new sales chief Christian Scherer as airlines wait for deliveries.

For many airlines, the financial pain is acute since oil prices have bounced back to $80 dollars: exactly the market the A321neo and similar fuel-saving models were designed for.

""Airlines can deal with planes that are off-spec but not ones that are late. They have built a network plan which takes account of new aircraft in the fleet,"" Ascend chief consultant Rob Morris said. Boeing has also had some delays.

Hamburg's woes highlight the operational issues at stake as planemaking chief Guillaume Faury prepares to become chief executive in April. His two main industrial lieutenants, Tom Williams and Didier Evrard, retire at end-year.

Insiders say Faury, who has made production the ""priority of priorities"" for this quarter, will not be replaced as president of commercial jets but may appoint an operations leader.

We are confident that our new H130 will allow us to best serve the communities that depend on us.”

The H130’s superior high altitude and the large cabin size will help medical personnel effectively treat patients in challenging environments, and the aircraft’s low operating costs will allow MARC to provide safe, comfortable and worry-free medical transportation, per its mission statement.

“We are happy to welcome MARC to the Airbus family, and look forward to a strong partnership with this patient-centered provider, as it prepares for growth,” said Chris Emerson, president of Airbus Helicopters Inc. and head of the North America region.

“Its selection of the H130 is further evidence that air medical providers trust our aircraft to help them achieve their demanding missions. We know they have a choice and we are proud that they choose Airbus.”
