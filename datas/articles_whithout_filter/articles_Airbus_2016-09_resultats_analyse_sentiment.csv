Airbus innovation at work: 25 years of aircraft family commonality - Airbus,"Tue, 20 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE2LTA5LWFpcmJ1cy1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLWF0LXdvcmstMjUteWVhcnMtb2YtYWlyY3JhZnQtZmFtaWx5LWNvbW1vbmFsaXR50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Family Flight<br /> A320neo<br /> A350-900<br /> A380<br /> A330-200

The commonality feature of Airbus’ fly-by-wire jetliner families is marking 25 years of operations, providing benefits that range from enhanced fleet deployment, improved efficiency and better scheduling for airlines to greater productivity, proficiency and job satisfaction for pilots.Airbus’ A320 was the first fly-by-wire airliner to enter commercial service, providing a cornerstone in the company’s forward-looking approach that brought cockpits and flight controls into the modern era. The commonality results from Airbus’ continuous application of similarities in cockpit layout and functionality – along with shared aircraft handling characteristics and similarity in systems – across its product line of fly-by-wire aircraft.Today, Airbus commonality covers everything from the single-aisle A320 Family (composed of the A318, A319, A320 and A321) to the widebody A330, A340, A350 XWB and the double-deck A380.Within the twin-engine A320 Family, flight crew members can perform Single Fleet Flying – easily shifting among the various aircraft models, thereby flying multiple versions with the same type rating.Advantages of Single Fleet Flying include the optimum use of pilot resources by airlines, reduced training requirements for flight crews as well as related lower costs for airlines, and increased flight opportunities for pilots.These benefits extend to the latest A320neo (new engine option) variants as well. The world’s airworthiness authorities have concluded that even with the installation of NEO’s new powerplants, the aircraft can be considered variants of the A320ceo (current engine option) family members – allowing all versions to be operated by pilots with the same A320 type rating.Single Fleet Flying also applies within other Airbus product line segments, such as the A330, covering its A330-200 and A330-300 passenger models, the A330-200F freighter…and in the future, the A330neo (new engine option) version.And while the long-range A330 and next-generation A350 XWB have different type certificates, their handling characteristics are so similar that they have been granted a Common Type Rating from the airworthiness authorities. To transition from an A330 to the A350 XWB, pilots use laptop-based systems and ground-based trainers, eliminating the mandatory need for expensive full-flight simulators and a full type rating check ride. The pilots can then be assigned to both the A330 and A350 under terms of a single licence endorsement – another example of Single Fleet Flying that results directly from Airbus commonality.Commonality also streamlines the requirements in transitioning from one Airbus jetliner product type to another. For instance, an A320-rated pilot who is going to qualify on the very large, four-engine A380 is given shortened ground training courses and only five simulator sessions; whereas pilots without previous Airbus fly-by-wire experience would require more extensive training – both in ground school and with flight simulators.This commonality-related aspect within the Airbus product line is called Cross Crew Qualification, and it enhances the opportunities for a pool of multi-qualified pilots to operate, for example, both single-aisle and widebody Airbus airliners in what is referred to as Mixed Fleet Flying.Commonality enables airlines to create a truly integrated fleet management structure, offering flexibility in the scheduling rosters for their crews and improving the utilisation of their aircraft – such as seamlessly bringing in a longer-fuselage A321 on a route where passenger volume has grown beyond the capacity of an A320.Gerrit Van Dijk, who works in Technical Marketing - Aircraft Operations for Airbus Customer Affairs, noted that it is not uncommon for a pilot to experience six to eight changes in the aircraft types flown during a career, involving typical retraining costs of $30,000 for each changeover. “Add some 1.5 months of pilot downtime for each change, and it becomes obvious that the combined costs to airlines is several billion dollars every year,” he said. “However, those with Airbus fleets can reduce pilot retraining costs by two-thirds on average.”According to Van Dijk, the advantages of commonality not only apply to large main-line carriers with significant aircraft fleets; smaller airlines in particular can benefit from powerful economies of scale that previously were the privilege of big operators. Depending on the mix of fleet and the nature of an airline’s flight operations, annual revenue flying time per pilot may increase by 5-15 percent with Single Fleet Flying and Mixed Fleet Flying, he added.Pilots appreciate Airbus commonality for the opportunities of a more varied work environment, including the ability to fly on a larger part of an airline’s route network, while enjoying better mobility within their airline and across the job market, Van Dijk explained.He cited the example of pilots who alternate long-haul and short-range trips by applying Single Fleet Flying and Mixed Fleet Flying. These flight crew personnel have the possibility to perform more takeoffs and landings for proficiency, while enabling a better work and life balance compared with being assigned only long-haul flying.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999938011169434}",positive,0.9999938011169434,1
U.S. and Boeing see WTO ruling as huge victory in dispute over Airbus subsidies - GeekWire,"Thu, 22 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlZWt3aXJlLmNvbS8yMDE2L3Utcy1ib2Vpbmctd3RvLWRpc3B1dGUtYWlyYnVzLXN1YnNpZGllcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The World Trade Organization turned up the heat on Europe’s aerospace industry today by ruling that Airbus was continuing to benefit from what’s now estimated at $22 billion in subsidies from the European Union and its member countries.

U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman hailed the decision as a “sweeping victory” in a dispute that has been simmering for more than a decade, with the Boeing Co. cast as the principal victim of Airbus’ subsidies.

“This long-awaited decision is a victory for fair trade worldwide, and for U.S. aerospace workers in particular,” Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing’s chairman, president and CEO, said in a statement.

Both of Washington state’s U.S. senators and several House members praised the development as well.

The WTO’s latest action marks one more step toward imposing retaliatory trade sanctions that could amount to as much as $10 billion a year.

However, U.S. trade officials acknowledge that there are likely to be further appeals and deliberations over the months and years ahead. Speaking on background with reporters, they said they hoped the ruling would bring European officials to the negotiating table for a resolution of the long-running Boeing-Airbus dispute.

In addition to the U.S. government’s complaints about Airbus subsidies, the WTO has been considering the European Union’s complaints about Boeing subsidies – including $8.7 billion in tax breaks that Washington state provided to get Boeing to build its 777X jet in Everett.

The WTO is expected to rule on how well the U.S. is complying with limits on subsidies sometime next year, and there’s a chance the ruling will go against the federal government. But even if that happens, trade officials argue that Europe’s subsidies are much more egregious.

The global trade organization’s compliance panel found that the European Union as well as Germany, France, Britain and Spain were continuing to flout previously mandated restrictions on subsidies, primarily by providing “launch aid” for new airplane models. Such aid generally takes the form of loans made to Airbus on terms that are more advantageous than what’s available commercially.

The World Trade Organization has now found that Airbus is and always has been a creature of government and of illegal government subsidy.

Today’s report confirmed the WTO’s previous rulings that European countries provided $15 billion in launch aid for Airbus jet models ranging from the A300 through the A380, plus $2 billion in other subsidies. In an added twist, the WTO found for the first time that Airbus received almost $5 billion in launch aid for its superjumbo A350 XWB.

The compliance report determined that Boeing lost tens of billions of dollars in sales because of the subsidies. Those lost sales included 271 Boeing 737s due to the A320 subsidies. Fifty lost sales in the twin-aisle market, which includes the 767, 777 and 787, were attributed to European subsidies to the A330, A340 and A350 XWB. And the A380 subsidies were blamed for 54 lost sales of Boeing 747 jets.

In a previous ruling, the WTO said that “without the subsidies, Airbus would not have existed … and there would be no Airbus aircraft on the market.” Today’s report upheld that view, sparking sharp comments from J. Michael Littig, executive vice president and general counsel at Boeing.

“The World Trade Organization has now found that Airbus is and always has been a creature of government and of illegal government subsidy,” he said. “The day of reckoning for launch aid has finally arrived.”

However, the European Union took issue with that interpretation. “An important win for the EU is that the panel rejected new U.S. claims that repayable support for the Airbus models A350 XWB and A380 are ‘prohibited subsidies,'” the Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal quoted an EU spokesman as saying.

Airbus said “only tiny tweaks” would be required to bring its launch aid arrangements into full compliance.

Almost 80,000 employees work for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, accounting for a little more than half of total Boeing workforce. Most of those employees live in Washington state, and Boeing’s jet manufacturing operations in Everett and Renton support hundreds of smaller suppliers in the region. For that reason, politicians from Washington state were among the first to hail today’s WTO action.

The deal by the European manufacturer has been pending since January and was made possible by last year's nuclear agreement between the major world powers and Iran.

Sanctions that had barred companies such as Airbus from trading with Iran were lifted after Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear development program, but the European firm still needed U.S. approval of the deal.

Iran Air agreed to buy several different types of planes, including the single-aisle A320 and the double-decker A380.

Iran's fleet of aging passenger jets badly needs upgrading, as a result of years of deferred maintenance during the time when international sanctions were in effect against Tehran, curtailing the country's ability to acquire spare parts for the aircraft.

American manufacturer Boeing Co. reached a tentative agreement with Iran at the beginning of this year that also could be worth $25 billion. If that deal also is approved by the U.S. government, it would be the biggest commercial transaction between Iran and an American corporation since 1979, when Iran's monarchy was toppled by its Islamic revolution, protesters stormed the U.S. Embassy, and the Tehran government held 52 Americans hostage for more than 14 months.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9990491271018982}",neutral,0.9990491271018982,0

Airbus Corporate Jets has completed the first Sharklet winglet retrofit onto an ACJ319.

The European manufacturer managed the the project on behalf of Comlux, with the work being completed by TAP Maintenance and Engineering.

Retrofitting Sharklet winglets onto an ACJ319 could save up to 4% on long journeys, as well as giving an extra range boost.

“Comlux has always been a leader in Airbus corporate jets, and our Sharklet retrofit highlights our innovative approach to offering customers one of the world’s most modern and handsome corporate jet fleets,” said Richard Gaona, chairman and CEO, Comlux.

Airbus say that the sharklet modification can be added to any of the A320 family aircraft from serial number 1200.

“Airbus has a reputation for innovative solutions and long-term relationships in the airliner world, so it’s great to have the opportunity to echo that with this one with Sharklets in corporate jets, with a leader such as Comlux,” said Benoit Defforge, managing director, Airbus Corporate Jets.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9786924719810486}",positive,0.9786924719810486,1
Airbus invests in 4 high-resolution optical Earth observation satellites -- with no government net - SpaceNews,"Fri, 16 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXJidXMtaW52ZXN0cy1pbi00LWhpZ2gtcmVzb2x1dGlvbi1vcHRpY2FsLWVhcnRoLW9ic2VydmF0aW9uLXNhdGVsbGl0ZXMtd2l0aC1uby1nb3Zlcm5tZW50LW5ldC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Airbus Defence and Space on Sept. 15 said it would finance, apparently on its own, a constellation of four very-high-resolution optical Earth observation satellites to launch in 2020 and 2021.

The program, which industry officials said likely represents a capital investment of more than 500 million euros ($550 million), was surprising to the extent that many Airbus officials regretted the company’s 2009 decision to invest 300 million euros into two medium-resolution optical satellites, called Spot 6 and Spot 7.

Then as now, Airbus was concerned about protecting its existing geospatial imagery business even if it meant making a commitment without any guarantee by the French government or any other anchor customer.

But Airbus has said its geospatial-imagery business, which includes both optical and radar satellites, has improved in recent years.

Bernhard Brenner, head of the Intelligence Business Cluster at Airbus Defence and Space, declined to specify the ground resolution of the four satellites but said they would be “world class” and would succeed the two Pleiades satellites in orbit and capable of generating images at 70 centimeters’ resolution, and as sharp as 50 centimeters when “resampled” with one image overlaid on another.

Airbus has access to part of the Pleiades capacity, which it operates in a de facto constellation with the medium-resolution Spot 6 and Spot 7. But it was the French government, not Airbus, that financed the construction and launch of the Pleiades spacecraft.

Airbus has since sold the Spot 7 satellite to the government of Azerbaijan, although Airbus continues to operate Spot 7 as part of the Spot-Pleiades constellation. It could not be determined whether Airbus ultimately would attempt to recoup a part of its investment through a similar deal for the new satellites.

French Air Force Brig. Gen. Jean-Daniel Teste, head of France’s Joint Space Command, on Sept. 16 said the French military has given Airbus no guarantees about future data purchases.

In an informal briefing with reporters, Teste said the French government understood that Airbus needed to keep up with its biggest competitor, DigitalGlobe of Westminster, Colorado, which has U.S. government approval to sell imagery as sharp as 30 centimeters.

Teste said the French Ministry of Defense remains focused on its on next-generation military reconnaissance satellite system, called CSO, a French acronym meaning Optical Space Component.

The French military in 2010 ordered two CSO satellites from Airbus and Thales Alenia Space of France and Italy — the same team that has built all previous French optical Earth observation satellites. The contract was valued at 795 million euros.

In 2015, the German military agreed to finance an identical third CSO satellite to form a constellation with improved revisit characteristics.

The CSO system is military only and Teste said it would account for most French military satellite reconnaissance requirements once the Helios spacecraft is retired.

But Teste said it was likely that in addition to CSO, French military would have occasional use of the Airbus constellation.

He said the French government would place no special limits on Airbus’ use of its assets but that it would need to meet existing French law on which nations would not be permitted to permit sophisticated French technology. But this concerned only a few nations and should not constitute a major hurdle to the Airbus business.

On industry official said that, in keeping with the increasingly competitive relationship between Airbus and Thales Alenia Space, the four satellites’ imaging instruments would be provided by Airbus France, using the company’s silicon carbide technology.

This official said the exact ground sampling distance had not been set, but would be around 40 centimeters — better than the Pleiades system, but not dramatically so.

“Operational Pleiades system features will be improved to match the market requirements expected to be the norm at the time of launch, and will deliver new applications such as business intelligence and analytics,” Airbus said in a statement.

In a Sept. 15 address here at the World Satellite Business Week, organized by Euroconsult, Brenner expressly thanked the French government for its role, which he did not detail, in facilitating the project.

“This constellation, entirely funded, owned and operated by Airbus Defence and Space, will respect the continuity of Pléiades and all French laws and regulations,” Airbus said in its statement.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9988033771514893}",neutral,0.9988033771514893,0
Airbus Files Patent For Unusual Hybrid Vertical Takeoff Aircraft - Popular Mechanics,"Mon, 05 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHVsYXJtZWNoYW5pY3MuY29tL2ZsaWdodC9uZXdzL2EyMjY5NS9haXJidXMtcGF0ZW50LXZlcnRpY2FsLXRha2VvZmYv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aircraft makers have long sought to combine vertical landing and takeoff capability with the high speed and long range of a traditional fixed-wing airliner. Many have tried, yet nothing has become a viable mainstream aircraft. Now Airbus seems to be getting into the game with a new design outside the typical realm of passenger jets.

The aircraft manufacturer filed a patent for an aircraft capable of vertical takeoff that can transition to horizontal flight. The plane uses at least four rotors to supply that vertical lift. These are powered by independent electric motors and would operate in a similar fashion to a quadcopter. Energy for these motors would be provided by batteries and a generator connected to an internal combustion engine. This same engine will power a forward-facing propellor that will pull the aircraft through the air once it transitions to horizontal flight.

The patent description is specific about the fact that the vertical rotors can be stowed inside pylons. Each pylon will house two rotor assemblies each consisting of two rotor blades. Once in forward flight, the rotor assemblies will be stopped and aligned within their respective pylons. There they will be fully enclosed, eliminating any unnecessary drag. Once the rotors are secured, doors will close to seal the pylons. With the plane in typical horizontal flight, the wing becomes responsible for the vertical force required to keep the aircraft aloft.

Variations of the design also call for dual forward-facing propellers to further increase horizontal thrust, allowing the aircraft to operate at higher speed or to carry a larger load. This would also double the amount of electrical energy created by what are now two generators, thereby increasing the load available for the vertical portion of each flight.

The patent does not specify dimensions of the proposed aircraft, but included drawings seem to indicate room for at least two passengers. The description implies that the design could be scalable to sizes small enough to compete with delivery drones such as seen by Amazon or large enough to carry troops or cargo into the battlefield.

We don't know whether this unusual patent design will ever come to production or if a prototype has been planned. But with the rise of commercially available drones and technology to support larger electric motors, batteries, and generators combined with inexpensive automated flight stability computers, it won't be long before an aircraft like this will be an everyday sight.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999043941497803}",neutral,0.9999043941497803,0
US claims 'sweeping victory' in Airbus subsidy case - POLITICO Europe,"Thu, 22 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmV1L2FydGljbGUvdXMtY2xhaW1zLXN3ZWVwaW5nLXZpY3RvcnktaW4tYWlyYnVzLXN1YnNpZHktY2FzZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A model of the Airbus A380 during the inauguration of the new headquarters of Airbus Group on June 28, 2016 in Blagnac, on the outskirts of Toulouse | Remy Gabalda/AFP via Getty Images

The United States on Thursday said it had chalked up another big win in a 12-year-old legal battle against billions of dollars of European government support to help Airbus develop new aircraft and urged France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom to immediately end their support for Boeing’s chief rival.

“This report is a sweeping victory for the United States and its aerospace workers,” U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said in a statement. “We have long maintained that EU aircraft subsidies have cost American companies tens of billions of dollars in lost revenue, which this report clearly proves.”

A World Trade Organization compliance panel ruled that European governments had failed to adequately address illegal subsidies previously found by the WTO and that they further breached WTO rules by granting more than $4 billion in new subsidized financing for the Airbus A350 XWB — causing tens of billions of dollars in adverse effects to the U.S. industry, USTR said.

The European Commission has downplayed the ruling.

“It is important to read the findings of today’s report in its larger context,” a spokesperson said. “Two other WTO rulings are expected in the coming months as regards the American subsidies for Boeing … [including] a case on massive subsidies to Boeing from the state of Washington.”

An Airbus representative said they would only comment further once the decision was out.

“The World Trade Organization has now found that Airbus is and always has been a creature of government and of illegal government subsidy” — J. Michael Luttig

In total, the panel found nearly $22 billion in subsidized financing from the EU and Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Spain, and continuing lost U.S. exports worth tens of billions of dollars, the USTR said.

Yet, the victory might be short-lived for Boeing: The WTO is expected to follow up on today’s Airbus verdict with a second ruling that will fault the U.S. for insufficiently addressing concerns about subsidies benefiting the American company, people familiar with the case told the Wall Street Journal.

The EU claims the U.S. space agency NASA funded federal programs funneled more than $2.6 billion to Boeing, and other forms of tax breaks and federal level help in the U.S aerospace giant for around $8 billion. Some $2.2 billion in export subsidies also need to be added to the Boeing subsidy list, according to the European Commission.

The EU is likely to appeal the decision, a lawyer with knowledge of the case said, adding that given the complexity of the case “the decision might take at least another two years.”

Boeing cheered the ruling, which chief executive Dennis Muilenberg said ""finally holds the EU and Airbus to account for their flouting of global trade rules.""

“The World Trade Organization has now found that Airbus is and always has been a creature of government and of illegal government subsidy,” Boeing's executive vice president and general counsel, J. Michael Luttig, added in a statement, declaring the day of reckoning for European ""launch aid'' programs has finally arrived.

""Prior WTO rulings found that Airbus itself likely would not even exist without illegal launch aid, equity infusions, and infrastructure support,"" Luttig said. ""Today the WTO went further and found that Airbus’ existence continues to depend upon illegal, trade-distorting government subsidies in the form of launch aid, most recently for the A350 XWB — which reportedly totals almost $5 billion.”

The decision is the latest in pair of tit-for-tat cases that stretch back to 2004 when George W. Bush was president.

The U.S. challenge against European support for Airbus was immediately matched by an EU case against U.S. support for Boeing and the disputes have been slowly grinding their way through WTO system ever since.

The WTO, through both its initial panel and appellate body rulings, has found illegal subsidies on both sides of the Atlantic.

The USTR and Boeing trumpeted an appellate body decision in 2011 that they said found the EU and four of its member states had provided more than $18 billion in illegal support for Airbus, mostly in the form of low-interest “launch aid loans” to the aircraft manufacturer.

A year later, the EU and Airbus celebrated a second appellate body decision that they said found the U.S. federal and state governments had provided $5 billion to $6 billion in WTO-incompatible subsidies to Boeing from 1989 to 2006.

After today’s ruling, another compliance panel decision in the EU case against U.S. support for Boeing could set the stage for the two countries to slap sanctions on each other’s each exports unless a negotiated settlement is reached.

But first, a WTO arbitration panel would have to decide how much each side has suffered because of the other’s subsidies in order to determine the amount of trade retaliation that each side could impose.

“With [today’s] decisive ruling, it is now time for the EU to come to the table and settle, rather than waiting for future tariffs” — Maria Cantwell

“With [today’s] decisive ruling, it is now time for the EU to come to the table and settle, rather than waiting for future tariffs,” Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell said in the statement with Froman and several other lawmakers from Washington state, where Boeing has major production facilities. “Without having to compete against illegal, market-distorting practices, Boeing should win more sales around the world.”

Ahead of the ruling, a spokesman for Airbus downplayed its significance, saying European governments and the company had corrected the problems revealed in the previous decisions.

""We only needed to make limited changes in European policies and practices to comply with the Appellate Body’s report in this case,” Airbus spokesman Clay McConnell said. “Airbus did what we needed to do, in good faith and in the agreed time-frame. We will now see the result in the public release and see along with the EU if there are still remaining points to address.”

“But this particular case should not be seen in isolation,” McConnell continued. “On the other side, there are already decisions in two cases condemning Boeing’s illegal subsidies. Despite that, Airbus wants common sense to prevail: these disputes can only end in a balanced, mutual agreement.""

According to the USTR, the WTO compliance panel found that since 2006, subsidies to the Airbus A320 family of aircraft resulted in the displacement or impedance of Boeing 737s in the EU, Australian, Chinese and Indian markets, as well as lost sales of 271 737s.

In the twin-aisle market, which includes Boeing’s 767, 777, and 787 planes, the panel found that the subsidies benefiting Airbus’s A330, A340, and A350 XWB caused displacement or impedance of Boeing aircraft in the EU, Chinese, Korean and Singaporean markets, as well as lost sales of 50 Boeing aircraft, the USTR said.

Finally, when it came to the largest aircraft, the panel found that subsidies benefiting the A380 caused displacement or impedance of Boeing 747s in the EU, Australian Chinese, Korean, Singaporean and UAE markets, as well as lost sales of 54 Boeing aircraft, the USTR said.

Airbus and Local Motors push forward with crowdsourcing project on cargo drones - GeekWire,"Tue, 06 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlZWt3aXJlLmNvbS8yMDE2L2FpcmJ1cy1sb2NhbC1tb3RvcnMtY2FyZ28tZHJvbmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Amazon isn’t the only big-name company that’s developing a new kind of drone for cargo delivery: Europe’s Airbus Group is moving ahead with Local Motors on a partnership that takes a decidedly different tack.

The two companies have been crowdsourcing a drone design that parallels what Amazon and lots of other commercial ventures have been working on: an unmanned aircraft system that weighs no more than 55 pounds when fully loaded, and is capable of vertical takeoff and landing as well as fixed-wing forward flight.

The Airbus cargo drone could deliver an 11-pound (5-kilogram) payload to destinations within at least 37 miles (60 kilometers), and a 7-pound (3-kilogram) payload to 62 miles (100 kilometers). Top cruising speed? At least 50 mph.

That compares with Amazon’s plan to deliver packages weighing up to 5 pounds in 30 minutes or less. The drones would roam to destinations within in a radius of 10 miles or more, traveling at cruising speeds of 40 to 50 mph.



While Amazon has been relatively hush-hush about its drone development and test program, Airbus and Local Motors have adopted a strategy that’s known as co-creation.

This summer, they conducted an Airbus Cargo Drone Challenge that attracted 425 design entries. The top-rated designs won prizes ranging up to $50,000 in July, and some of the features may well be incorporated into the look of Airbus’ future fliers.

Today, Airbus and Local Motors said they’re moving on to “Phase II” of the partnership, which focuses on the development of the Airbus Drone Services Platform. ADSP will be a digital distribution platform for drone-based apps and services, Airbus Group said in a news release issued from the InterDrone 2016 conference in Las Vegas.

“Phase I of our partnership demonstrated to Airbus the power of community-based creation and open innovation,” said John B. Rogers Jr., Local Motors’ CEO and co-founder. “Phase II of our work together will now demonstrate Airbus’ commitment to the community. The results will be nothing short of game changing.”

Ideas for the ADSP will be solicited during this week’s InterDrone conference and at the HackMIT hackathon, scheduled later this month at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Local Motors specializes in co-creation design projects, such as the 3-D-printed, self-driving Olli minibus that’s currently being tested in pilot programs. The Phoenix-based company is also working on a range of designs for 3-D-printed cars.

In January, Local Motors became the first recipient of investment money from a $150 million fund backed by Airbus Ventures, the aerospace giant’s Silicon Valley spin-off.

At the time, Airbus Ventures’ Tim Dombrowski said the fund would take advantage of opportunities to “accelerate innovation in near ground, air and space flight.” Now it’s clear that Airbus, like Amazon, sees delivery drones as a prime air opportunity.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999977350234985}",neutral,0.9999977350234985,0
Airbus is finally allowed by the US government to sell planes to Iran - Business Insider,"Wed, 21 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWNhbi1zZWxsLWpldHMtaXJhbi0yMDE2LTnSAURodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1jYW4tc2VsbC1qZXRzLWlyYW4tMjAxNi05P2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus' historic sale of 118 jets to Iran Air may finally get the green light.

According to Tim Hepher of Reuters, aviation sources say that the United States government has decided to unblock the deal and began issuing export licenses for the aircraft.

The airplane maker told Business Insider that it has, thus far, received one license and expects to receive a second license soon. The two licenses will enable the airplane maker to deliver 118 planes.

""In a country of nearly 80 million people, it is accepted by the industry that there is a market need for some 400-500 new commercial planes to replace Iran’s existing aging fleet and meet growing air travel demand,"" a company spokesperson told Business Insider.

""Airbus has been working with the relevant authorities for some time to ensure all activities are undertaken in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations. This OFAC decision to issue a license to deliver aircraft to Iran is a reflection of that. A first license has been issued, and we expect a second license as well. Between the two, it allows for a total of 118 deliveries,"" the spokesperson said.

In recent months, members of the US House of Representatives have sought to block the deal by preventing the Office of Foreign Assets Control from authorizing the licenses necessary to complete the sale to Iran.

Even though Airbus is a European company, it sources many of the components used to build its planes from US suppliers.

By blocking the sale of these components, the US government can indirectly prevent the completion of the deal.

In January, Airbus and Iran Air agreed to a landmark deal with a total value rising to as much as $25 billion. In June, Boeing also agreed to sell 100 aircraft to the Iranian national airline.

Due to economic sanctions levied against Iran over the past few decades, the country's national airline has been unable to expand its service and update its fleet. As a result, Iran Air's fleet of nearly 50 airplanes has an average age of 27 years, according to Airfleets.net.



The mega deals with Airbus and Boeing are part of Iran Air's strategy to not only replace its dated aircraft, but also help put the country's once booming commercial aviation industry on a path to compete with regional rivals in the Persian Gulf.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998362064361572}",neutral,0.9998362064361572,0

Olympian and astronaut launch programme for Bristol students

The programme aims to motivate young students to continue towards higher education

At the launch of the UK’s first Flying Challenge programme, 30 young people from Bristol Metropolitan Academy in Fishponds met Olympian Kriss Akabusi and French Astronaut Claudie Haigneré. The programme sees the 13 and 14 year old students embark on a unique and potentially life-changing opportunity to work with Airbus volunteers. During the year-long programme they will learn about flight, careers in aviation, develop new skills, and gain practical experience.

The Flying Challenge programme, which is the Airbus Foundation’s largest youth mentoring programme, will include 20 weekly sessions at Airbus where they will get “behind the scenes” access to aviation design and test experts and facilities on the Filton site. They will also visit other aviation organisations in the Bristol area including Rolls Royce and Bristol airport and have a flying lesson. By the time they graduate from the Flying Challenge, participants will have undertaken a wide range of aerospace experiences, worked with committed employee mentors, completed a skills portfolio and worked towards a nationally recognised qualification.

This Airbus Foundation programme is being supported by two local charities ABLAZE, who aim to raise young people's aspiration, attainment and skill levels, and fly2help, who use the power of flight to help people change their lives.

Airbus Defence and Space opens new logistics centre in Bremen - Airbus,"Tue, 06 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNi0wOS1haXJidXMtZGVmZW5jZS1hbmQtc3BhY2Utb3BlbnMtbmV3LWxvZ2lzdGljcy1jZW50cmUtaW4tYnJlbWVu0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

50 million euros investment for project planning, development and operation until 2024

Airbus Defence and Space has opened a new logistics centre in Bremen’s Lloyd Industriepark, close to its base by the airport. The centre, established in cooperation with Kühne + Nagel’s contract logistics division, will meet increasing demand in military and civil fields. The new Materials Management Centre (MMC) was officially opened today following an 18 month build. Initially, it will be used mainly for A400M production and, in future, also for space applications.

""The MMC has a high-quality logistical and storage area of around 10,000 square metres, which caters for the special, aviation-specific requirements of the premises, the warehouse layout, storage area distribution and storage equipment,"" said Martin Weichhardt, Head of Procurement and Supply Chain at Airbus Defence and Space. ""An investment volume of around 50 million euros has been earmarked for project planning, development and operation until 2024.""

The Lloyd Industriepark in Bremen boasts excellent road, rail and air connections. Thanks to the special foundations, the new warehouse is supported by 8,000 piles. The MMC has a wide range of storage areas covering all required storage structures – from small parts, pallet and cantilever rack storage facilities to large components in floor/block storage areas. Thanks to the optimised storage and transportation routes, the new logistics centre can be operated by around 100 warehouse employees.

The new MMC replaces three old warehouses and will harmonise and streamline processes. The new centre will enable Airbus Defence and Space to meet increasingly complex requirements for punctual and continual delivery to production lines. Given the large amount of materials to be installed in each aircraft and the high degree of flexibility required for production, proximity of the centre to the production halls is key. Furthermore, a new optimised warehouse management system has been introduced.

An important element of the project was the two-month move, which has now been completed, since the consolidation of several warehouses into the new MMC had to take place without affecting the supply of production materials. A further key element of the new centre is the adaptation during the first three years of operation to an optimised supply of production materials, with the aim being to steadily reduce the warehouse and logistics area. This will predominantly occur through the variable area and equipment concept, which enables the premises to be used in a way that optimises space and costs, and allows a significant degree of freedom for future business models.

- Gaia’s ultra-stable silicon carbide platform has enabled accurate mapping of 1.6 billion stars with 1.1 billion published today - Precision optical instrument could pick out a human hair at 700 km - Cold gas micro-propulsion system keeps Gaia ultra-stable as it orbits Lagrange point L2

The Airbus Defence and Space built Gaia spacecraft has mapped more than 1.6 billion stars thanks to its ultra-stable platform, with data on the positions and intensity of 1.1 billion stars published today.

Gaia, for the European Space Agency, has been mapping the universe since its launch on a Soyuz rocket in December 2013. Its mission is to carry out a far reaching census of our Milky Way galaxy. As the spacecraft spins it tracks huge numbers of stars simultaneously whilst maintaining near-perfect control of its attitude in space. Its micro-propulsion system can make precise adjustments using its thrusters to keep the satellite correctly aligned – it would need 1,000 of these micro-thrusters on Earth to lift a single sheet of paper.

At the heart of spacecraft is the video processing unit which has more processing power than any other ESA spacecraft. Gaia’s data is received at ESA’s 35 metre diameter radio dishes in Cebreros, Spain, and New Norcia, Australia.

“Today’s results will open up a new era in astronomy – a huge increase in precise data that will inform astronomers about the dynamics and origin of our galaxy and about hundreds of thousands of new objects in our solar system and beyond. All the engineers and technicians who designed and built Gaia at Airbus Defence and Space can be extremely proud,” said Nicolas Chamussy, Head of Space Systems at Airbus Defence and Space.

This release of data from Gaia builds upon and dramatically improves upon the results of ESA’s first astrometry mission, Hipparcos, launched in 1989, and also developed by Airbus Defence and Space.

The announcements Wednesday came as Iranian and US leaders are in New York for the United Nations General Assembly and show that the outgoing administration of President Barack Obama is honoring the economic terms of the nuclear pact.

The next administration, however, may change that equation for Airbus and Boeing, whose possible deal with Iran would be the biggest for an American company since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and US Embassy takeover.

European airplane manufacturer Airbus announced the license from the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control early Wednesday. Boeing followed with its own announcement later in the day.

Though based abroad, Airbus needed the approval of the US Treasury for the deal because at least 10 percent of the manufacturer’s components are of American origin.

Airbus applied for two licenses to cover its deal with Iran to ensure the fast delivery of some of the aircraft, Airbus spokesman Justin Dubon told The Associated Press. The license announced Wednesday covers the first 17 planes involved in the deal, which will be A320s and A330s, he said.

Dubon said Airbus hoped to receive a second license allowing it to sell the remaining planes to Iran soon.

In January, national carrier Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth some 22.8 billion euros ($25 billion). On Sunday, state TV reported that Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, a deputy transportation minister, said Iran would cut the number of Airbus planes to 112.

Base model A320s are listed at an average of $98 million, while A330s start at $231.5 million. That puts the value of the approved 17 aircraft in the first license around at least $1.8 billion and possibly much higher based on list prices, though buyers typically negotiate sizable discounts for bulk orders.

Under Boeing’s deal, Iran Air will buy 80 aircraft with a total list price of $17.6 billion, with deliveries beginning in 2017 and running until 2025. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s in a deal that Iranian officials have suggested would be worth some $25 billion in total.

In a statement, Boeing spokesman Marc Sklar said, “We have received that license and remain in talks with Iran Air” based on the memorandum of agreement reached in June.

The US Treasury confirmed in a statement that the agency had granted the first licenses to Airbus and Boeing.

“These licenses contain strict conditions to ensure that the planes will be used exclusively for commercial passenger use and cannot be resold or transferred to a designated entity,” the Treasury said in the statement.

Iran’s English language Press TV reported Thursday that Deputy Transport Minister Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan said Iran expects the purchase of planes from Boeing to proceed faster than they will with France’s Airbus. “This is because the structure of negotiations with Boeing is different from that of Airbus,” he said.

Fakhrieh Kashan said Boeing has sent the text of its contract to Iran to be studied by the Iranian authorities. He said that Boeing officials were due to travel to Tehran next week to work toward finalizing the contract.

Iran’s UN mission did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.

Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, which limits its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of some international sanctions, specifically allowed for the purchase of aircraft and parts.

The license approval clears the way for the two plane manufacturers to begin accessing one of the last untapped aviation markets in the world, home to 80 million people. However, Western analysts are skeptical that there is demand for so many jets or available financing for two separate $25 billion deals.

Most Iranian planes were purchased before the Islamic Revolution that ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and brought Islamists to power. Out of Iran’s 250 commercial planes, 162 were flying in June, while the rest were grounded due to lack of spare parts.

Iran Air, whose website lists 43 airplanes in its fleet, says it has direct flights to over 30 international destinations, including London.

The aircraft deal also has become a political issue in an election year in the US. Some American lawmakers have criticized the Boeing deal to Iran over the Islamic Republic’s “pernicious behavior,” including launching ballistic missiles, firing rockets near US warships in the strategic Strait of Hormuz and briefly detaining American sailors who strayed into its territorial waters.

The US presidential election could also have an effect on the sales. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has threatened to tear up the nuclear deal if elected this November.

The announcement comes as Iranian leaders and U.S. officials are gathered this week in New York for the United Nations General Assembly and serves as a sign that the outgoing administration of President Barack Obama will honor the economic terms of the accord.

Airbus received the license from the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, Airbus spokesman Justin Dubon told The Associated Press. He said the first 17 planes will be A320s and A330s. He declined to offer a breakdown of how many of each are involved in the initial sale, but said Airbus hoped to receive a second license allowing it to sell the remaining planes to Iran.

Iranian officials had no immediate comment and its state media did not immediately report the approval.

Earlier this year, national carrier Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from the European consortium Airbus, estimated to be worth some 22.8 billion euros ($25 billion). The deal was made possible by last year’s historic nuclear agreement, which lifted sanctions on Iran in return for it curbing its atomic program.

Under the terms of the initial Airbus deal announced in January, Iran Air agreed to buy several different types of planes ranging from the single-aisle A320 up to the double-decker A380.

Base model A320s are currently listed at an average of $98 million, while A330s start at $231.5 million.

That puts the value of the approved planes around at least $18 billion and possibly much higher based on list prices, though buyers typically negotiate sizable discounts for bulk orders.

The announcement by Airbus will be closely watched by Chicago-based Boeing Co. (BA), which has an agreement with Iran that Iranian officials have suggested could be worth as much as $25 billion. Such a deal would be the biggest between an American company and Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and U.S. Embassy takeover.

In a June letter to the U.S. Congress, Boeing said the deal involves Iran Air buying 80 aircraft with a total list price of $17.6 billion, with deliveries beginning in 2017 and running until 2025. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s.

Spanish Army Takes Receipt of First NH90s - Airbus,"Tue, 13 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNi0wOS1zcGFuaXNoLWFybXktdGFrZXMtcmVjZWlwdC1vZi1maXJzdC1uaDkwc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

The NH90 is entering into service for the first time with the Spanish Army

Madrid, Today, the Directorate General of Armament and Equipment (DGAM) completed the transfer of the first two NH90 tactical transport helicopters from the Airbus Helicopters plant in Albacete to the Spanish Army. The handover was made at the Coronel Maté Air Base in Colmenar Viejo, the headquarter of the Spanish Army Airmobile Force (FAMET) and marked the entry into service of the NH90 within the FAMET. The ceremony was conducted by Lieutenant General Juan Bautista García Sánchez, the head of the Spanish Army’s Logistic Support Command Center, who was accompanied by a number of civil and military dignitaries.The NH90s, which the Army has renamed HT-29 Caimans, will form part of FAMET’s Third Manoeuvre Helicopter Battalion (BHELMA III), based at the Héroes del Revellín Barracks in Agoncillo. A third helicopter was already transferred earlier this month to the FAMET and is stationed at the Agoncillo base, where it is performing training missions. Two additional NH90s will be delivered by Airbus Helicopters by the end of the year, making it five aircraft handed over in 2016. In total, the company will supply 22 NH90 helicopters to the Spanish Armed Forces, under a delivery schedule that runs up to 2021.On December 18, 2014, Airbus Helicopters signed an agreement with the Spanish Ministry of Defense for the delivery of the first NH90 GSPA tactical transport helicopter for FAMET. The aircraft was wholly assembled at Airbus Helicopters plant in Albacete and successfully completed the industrial, airworthiness certification and technical acceptance phases; a process in which the DGAM and Airbus Helicopters collaborated closely. Since 2014, Airbus Helicopters has delivered a total of three NH90s to the DGAM. The aircraft have been used to provide training for the first squad of Army pilots qualified to fly the helicopter.Promoted by the Spanish Ministry of Defense, supported by the Ministry of Industry and managed by the DGAM, the NH90 program is the first that aims to meet the operational needs of the three branches of the Spanish Armed Forces. It is based on a common platform adapted to the requirements of each mission and featuring all the latest technological developments. As a result, it seeks to improve effectiveness and streamline operating expenses by reducing and modernizing the current fleet of helicopters, while also ensuring their sustainability over time.The Spanish version of the NH90, the GSPA, has been designed to perform technical missions such as troop transport, search and rescue, personnel recovery and medical evacuation. It is equipped for day and night operations in all types of environments. Opened in 2007, the Airbus Helicopters plant in Albacete is responsible for the assembly of all NH90 helicopters for the Spanish Armed Forces, along with manufacture of the front fuselage section—both for Spanish helicopters and for those earmarked for export. It is also the only plant in the world to manufacture the rear fuselage of the Tiger helicopter, and the only Spanish facility with a helicopter-manufacturing capability.Airbus Helicopters, a division of Airbus Group, provides the most efficient civil and military helicopter solutions worldwide. Its in-service fleet includes nearly 12,000 helicopters operated by more than 3,000 customers in 154 countries. Airbus Helicopters employs more than 22,000 people worldwide and in 2015 generated revenues of 6.8 billion euros.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999895095825195}",neutral,0.9999895095825195,0
Airbus Plans Internal Merger in Latest Corporate Shake-Up - Fortune,"Fri, 30 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAxNi8wOS8zMC9haXJidXMtZ3JvdXAtbWVyZ2VyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Group (AIRBUS-GROUP-N-V) said on Friday it would merge with its plane-making unit, strip out bureaucracy and simplify its brand, marking a break with its complex corporate roots as it prepares for tougher expected competition.

Europe’s largest aerospace group will be renamed “Airbus” after its core plane-making brand under the shake-up, the latest piece of corporate tinkering since it emerged from a cluster of French, German and Spanish aerospace interests in 2000.

Airbus confirmed the promotion of Fabrice Bregier to the new role of chief operating officer for the whole group, with overall responsibility for reshaping digital operations as well as for the global supply chain and quality.

He will continue to carry out his existing job in charge of the plane-making business, renamed Airbus Commercial Aircraft.

“We are bringing Team Airbus closer together, recognizing that our commercial aircraft division is by far the largest contributor to our company’s revenues and financials,” Chief Executive Tom Enders said in a statement.

The company curbed the influence of French and German governments in 2013 and adopted its best-known jetmaking brand a year later by renaming itself Airbus Group, but left in place an overlapping structure and confusion over which Airbus was which.

People familiar with the plans said earlier that this distinction would now disappear as the vehicle for the original merger, known as Airbus Group SAS, and the planemaker, Airbus SAS, merge into a single company based in Toulouse under a sole chief executive, German-born Enders.

Both are currently subsidiaries of the listed entity, Airbus Group SE, which is based in the Netherlands.

Enders has promised to bring new digital thinking into production, development and support to speed decision-making and prepare for future competition across the group’s products which range from aircraft to satellites and defense systems.

Get Term Sheet, Fortune’s daily email about deals and deal-makers.

He told staff in a letter last week the changes would result in consolidation and cost-reductions at the top of the company.

The heads of the company’s two other divisions, helicopters boss Guillaume Faury and defense and space chief Dirk Hoke, are expected to carry out additional group-wide roles to help drive through Enders’ so-called “digital transformation” project.

The company said these units would benefit from reduced costs due to the internal merger, which will take effect in January. It did not provide any financial details.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9933429956436157}",neutral,0.9933429956436157,0
Airbus uses industrial IoT to build a factory for the future - RCR Wireless News,"Mon, 19 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJjcndpcmVsZXNzLmNvbS8yMDE2MDkxOS9iaWctZGF0YS1hbmFseXRpY3MvaW5kdXN0cmlhbC1pb3QtYWlyYnVzLXRhZzMxLXRhZzk50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The devil is in the details

Today’s aerospace factory floors are very different from the noisy production environments of the past. The latest techniques, designs and equipment make modern manufacturing efficient, organized and structured, according to a National Instruments case study. Airbus is trying to take its factories into the future by teaming with National Instruments on a research and technology project that will automate the company’s many manual operations using the industrial “internet of things.”

The challenge for the leading aerospace company is that the manufacturing and assembly of aircraft involves tens of thousands of steps that must be followed by operators, and a single mistake in the process could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to fix.

Making a smart factory

To overcome this, Airbus decided it needs to add intelligence to the tools and shop floor systems, which will help simplify the production process and provide improved efficiency. It used Ni’s System on Module to quickly prototype these smart tools.

NI and industrial IoT

Cyberphysical systems and big data enable a smarter, operator-centric production that allows operators and machines to collaborate in the same physical environment, according to Airbus. What it calls “The factory of the future” requires the extensive use of a modular platform with a high level of abstraction based on commercial off-the-shelf modules. Smart devices are designed to communicate with a main infrastructure or locally with operators or other tools, but only when it is required to provide situational awareness and make real-time decisions based on local and distributed intelligence on the network.

In the case of a manufacturing facility, smart tools can help simplify the production process and improve efficiency by removing physical data logs and manuals. Operators must focus on their operational tasks, during which they need to keep their hands free for using the appropriate tools. Most of the previous initiatives linked to “paperless projects” were focused on “paper suppression,” or replacing paper with tablets, but they still consumed “passive/dead data.” Smart tools enable another alternative, “data in context,” which is generated and consumed continuously – “live data.”

According to NI, by adding intelligence to the airplane manufacturing system, the smart tools understand the actions that the operator must perform next and automatically adjust to the proper settings, which simplifies the task for the operator. Once the action is completed, the smart tools also can monitor and log the results of the action, which improves the efficiency of the production process.

For example, a given subassembly of an airplane has roughly 400,000 points that need to be tightened down, which requires more than 1,100 basic tightening tools in the current production process. The operator has to closely follow a list of steps and ensure the proper torque law settings for each location using the correct tool. Because of the manual process, human error adds a lot of risk to the production. This is significant since even a single location being tightened down incorrectly could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in the long run. A smart tightening tool understands which task the operator is about to perform using vision to process its surroundings and automatically set the torque. And the device can record the outcome of the task in a central database to ensure the location was set properly. With the central manufacturing execution system database and the distributed intelligence of the devices, production managers can precisely pinpoint the procedures and processes that need to be reviewed during quality control and certification.

Airbus is launching the development of three smart tool families that perform different manufacturing processes: drilling, measuring, and quality data logging and tightening:

Drilling Tool

Process surroundings with vision algorithms;

Verify which material is about to be cut through;

Update cutting conditions of the drill at each material layer;

Monitor the drilling depth;

Log the results of the drill at the current location;

Monitor system health; and

Perform automatic checks/calibration.

Measuring Tool

Process surroundings with vision algorithms;

Retrieve acceptable measurement values from a database;

Check that the measurement is within the parameters;

Log results and provide follow-up actions if necessary; and

Perform automatic checks/calibration.

Quality Validation Tool (based on human decision)

Process surroundings with vision algorithms;

Perform human native interaction (finger tracking, eye tracking, voice control); and

Log results and provide follow-up actions if necessary.

Tightening Tool

Process surroundings with vision algorithms;

Set the appropriate torque/speed/angle laws for the location;

Monitor the torque applied to the fasteners;

Log the given torque to a central MES database or an enterprise resource planning system; and

Perform automatic checks/calibration.

Airbus tested the NI System on Module as the foundation platform for all of these smart tools because of the ubiquitous architecture and framework it provides to accelerate the development process from design to prototyping to deployment. Before developing on the NI SOM, Airbus was able to create a prototype based on an NI CompactRIO controller that allowed the company to integrate IP from existing Airbus libraries and open-source algorithms to validate concepts.

“We evaluated several systems on modules and embedded single-board computers, and there is no comparison to the software integration offered by NI,” said Sébastien Boria, ‎research and development mechatronics engineer at Airbus. “We estimate that our time to deliver with the NI SOM is a tenth of the time using alternative approaches because of the productivity gains of NI’s approach to system design, particularly with NI Linux Real-Time and the LabVIEW FPGA Module.”

The “Factory of the Future” at Airbus is an incremental long-term research and technology project that is critical to its competitiveness in manufacturing processes, according to the company. Rapid development is critical for the incremental approach of new technology, from initial proof-of-concept development to real object dissemination. The company said it has carefully planned this initiative over the past few years, and, with NI technology, it can accelerate the development process to bring its vision into reality.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8360995054244995}",neutral,0.8360995054244995,0
Here's why Emirates and the Airbus A380 superjumbo work well together - Business Insider,"Tue, 13 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vd2h5LWVtaXJhdGVzLWZseS1haXJidXMtYTM4MC0yMDE2LTnSAUdodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL3doeS1lbWlyYXRlcy1mbHktYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtMjAxNi05P2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus A380. Airbus

More than a decade after its maiden flight, the Airbus A380 superjumbo remains a major point of interest and curiosity for passengers and airline industry insiders alike.

As impressive and attention grabbing as the aircraft may be, it hasn't had the same paradigm-shifting effect that the Boeing 747 had upon its debut decades earlier.

Most of the airlines around the world who either operate the A380 or are thinking about investing in the plane have struggled to figure out a way to maximize its revenue generating potential.

As a result, Airbus has struggled mightily over the past few years to find new customers for its flagship airliner.

However, the double-decker jet has no bigger supporter than Emirates Airlines.

Of the 319 orders Airbus has won for the super jumbo, 140 of them have come from the Dubai-based airline. In comparison, Singapore Airlines has the second largest order with 24 A380s.

Why does Emirates love the A380 so much?

""Airport congestion around the world is getting worse,"" Emirates President Sir Tim Clark told Business Insider. ""And up-gauging aircraft is a solution for this.""

Emirates' business strategy involves funneling large masses of people to its palatial home base in Dubai and dispatching them to various destinations around the world. Often times, those destinations are either well-developed first world cities or under developed third-world cities, that are both plagued by airports bursting at the seams with people and planes.

According to Sir Tim Clark, the A380 allows Emirates to get ahead of congestion issues at major airport around the world. With infrastructure struggling to keep up with demand for landing slots and airport gates, the superjumbo allows the airline to increase passenger volume with fewer aircraft and fewer flights.

""It works great for our network structure's long-haul to long-haul connections,"" Emirates senior vice president for operations Hubert Frach told Business Insider in an interview. ""It allows us to offer efficient connections between developing economies with well established economies.""

As a result, Emirates and its centrally located-Dubai base has become a gateway — connecting Europe and North America with Africa and Asia.

While other carriers operating the A380 have concerns over filling the double decker's cavernous cabin, Emirates does not seem to have that concern.

""Although you can't operate each and every destination with the aircraft, we do see the demand pull of the A380,"" Frach said. ""Take London for example. We operate nine A380 flights into London every day and, believe me, they are all full.""

And the strategy seems to be working. In May, Emirates announced a record $1.93 billion profit for the last fiscal year with a margin of 8.4%. Although it should be noted that Emirates, along with the rest of the airline industry, has benefited greatly from plummeting fuel costs.

In addition, the rapid growth of Emirates and its fellow Middle Eastern carriers Etihad and Qatar have come under criticism from American, United, and Delta Air Lines. The US3 allege that the ME3's stellar performance and service are unfairly augmented by as much as $42 billion in subsidies over the past 10 years. The ME3 have denied these allegations.

In addition to the operational benefits of the A380, it's also a great marketing piece.

""At the Berlin Air Show, we usually bring a brand new A380 that's just been delivered from the Airbus factory in Hamburg and the line to see the plane usually a mile long,"" Sir Tim Clark told us while in New York for the US Open tennis tournament for which his airline is a major sponsor.

It's a sentiment echoed by Frach.

""Every time I'm on an A380, I still see people taking selfies and photos of the plane,"" the executive added. ""It's iconic and it's a customer magnet.""

Emirates isn't the only airline that understands the marketing power of the superjumbo. In May, Qatar Airways launched its inaugural flight to Atlanta — the home fortress for Delta, arguably the Middle Eastern airlines' staunchest critic. Although the flight is normally operated by a smaller Boeing 777, Qatar decided to make a splash by rolling into town with a superjumbo — an aircraft Delta does not possess in its 800-plane fleet.

Etihad operates its glamour routes to London and New York using its A380s as well.

Why don't more airlines buy the A380?

If the A380 works so well for Emirates, why don't more airlines around the world commit to the plane?

""Since the great recession, airlines around the world are run by risk averse boards who don't want to spend $400 million on a single plane,"" Clark said. ""Here, we don't have that, it's just me and my boss (Emirates Group chairman H.H. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum).""

Due to geography, Emirates operates only international flights and boasts a fleet of roughly 250 wide-body long haul jets. In addition to the world's largest fleet of A380s, it also boasts the world's largest fleet of Boeing 777s with more than 150 of the twin-engined jets.

However, the reality of the A380 is that it is the largest and most expensive airliner in the world at $428 million a plane. Boeing's 777-9X is second at $400 million.

Even though it's capable of offering its operators the lowest per-seat cost of any airliner in the world, its four-massive turbo fan engines are far from economical.

As a result, even Emirates' well-financed neighbor Etihad have limited its fleet of A380s to just 10 planes.

""No, we're done,"" Etihad Aviation Group CEO James Hogan told Business Insider last year when asked whether he'd buy more A380s. ""We just believe in two-engine technology — they are much more efficient.""

But for now, the Airbus A380 is alive and moving forward with its most important customer.

""We are taking another 50 or so A380s,"" Clark said. ""So we're keeping the production line going.""","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9926880598068237}",negative,0.9926880598068237,-1

But in case anyone was wondering, Cowboys owner/general manager Jerry Jones likes to do things big.

That much was evident Thursday afternoon when Jones greeted reporters after stepping off his newest mode of transportation, an Airbus H145 helicopter, which he landed on the Cowboys' practice field.

""It's absolutely state-of-the-art for Airbus,"" Jones said. ""More importantly, it'll be a great tool for us to be back and forth from our stadium in Arlington and be here in Frisco at The Star.""

He added: ""To me, it kinda says a little bit about the glitz and glamour of the Dallas Cowboys.""

The helicopter will cut the commute from the facility to the stadium – typically a 45-minute drive – to as few as 13 minutes, and it will serve as a convenient method of transportation for partners and business associates of the Cowboys organization – offering quite a view of The Star and AT&T Stadium, not to mention all the locations in between.

It's also highly-customizable, as the cabin console can be removed to install an additional seat, and easily removable cabin floor carpeting and other luxury features allow the helicopter to be used on work trips to Jones' ranch.

""This is multi-use – has the best power, has the best speed, has the best range,"" Jones said. ""We're excited about that. If we could just figure out a way for it to help us make some first downs, we'd really be excited.""

Jones bought the helicopter from nearby Airbus Helicopters, Inc., located in Grand Prairie, Texas. In the last decade, the company has sold nearly as many helicopters as the combined total of its principal competitors. Airbus Helicopters products are the market leaders for air medical transport, law enforcement, and airborne tourism.

The company is a major supplier to the U.S. Army, the Coast Guard, and Customs and Border Protection. Texas Department of Public Safety is one of many state and local law enforcement agencies operating Airbus Helicopters products.

Treg Manning, the company's vice president of sales and marketing for North America, was on hand with Jones for the occasion, and stressed the excitement of a bond between Airbus and the Cowboys.

""We've been a part of this community since 1969, and we're very excited to be the No. 1 helicopter manufacturer,"" Manning said. ""We consider ourselves part of the home team since we've been here so long, and we're very excited to be associated with America's Team.

Did Hawaiian Air's CEO just mention the Airbus A380? - USA TODAY,"Thu, 22 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmF2ZWwvZmxpZ2h0cy90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTYvMDkvMjIvZGlkLWhhd2FpaWFuLWFpcnMtY2VvLWp1c3QtbWVudGlvbi1haXJidXMtYTM4MC85MDg0ODI2NC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Did Hawaiian Air's CEO just mention the Airbus A380?

Could Hawaiian Airlines become the first U.S. carrier to fly Airbus’ A380 superjumbo jet?

It may be unlikely, but there’s sure to be at least some speculation after Hawaiian Air CEO Mark Dunkerley broached the subject at an event in London this week.

The Wall Street Journal says Hawaiian “has made some initial inquiries” about the A380, though the newspaper qualified that by adding those “discussions were mainly for informational purposes.” That's all according to the Journal’s report on comments made by Dunkerely at an Aviation Club event Wednesday in London.

Bloomberg News also picked up on the thread after talking to Dunkerely on the sidelines of the same event. Bloomberg writes Hawaiian “is looking seriously at whether the Airbus A380 might have a role to play within its network, especially on routes such as those from Honolulu to Los Angeles, Tokyo and Las Vegas, which it serves with smaller wide-body planes six, three and two times daily respectively.”

Fueling speculation on the subject is the possibility that A380s may soon be available to purchase inexpensively. That could come either from Airbus -- as it looks to drum up sales of its slow-selling superjumbo -- or via the used aircraft market, which is expected to see some A380s being returned by Singapore and, possibly, Malaysian Airlines.

Mark Lapidus, CEO of plane-leasing firm Amedeo, told Bloomberg the A380 could make sense for routes to Honolulu – a market that’s isolated geographically but relies on a high volume of tourist traffic.

“Hawaii would be a good fit for either a new or used A380,” Lapidus said to Bloomberg. “The sector distances are at least eight hours in every direction.”

But before anyone starts imagining A380s in a Hawaiian Airlines paint scheme, Dunkerely told Bloomberg he still needs to be convinced that flying A380s would be good for the airline’s bottom line.

In the meantime, Dunkerely did say Hawaiian is eyeing the possibility of flights to London and other European destinations once it begins receiving its next-generation Airbus A330s -- though that's not until the end of the decade.

The current A330 widebodies in Hawaiian’s fleet don’t have the range to make it to London or other destinations in Europe. But that could change with Airbus’ next version of the A330, the A330neo (new-engine option). It’s possible that version of the A330 could be extended enough to allow Hawaiian to fly flights to Europe or further into Asia, though Dunkerely cautioned to the Journal that decisions on such routes were not imminent.

Carrier also finalises services agreement to establish new training centre

Vietnam’s Vietjet has placed a firm order with Airbus for 20 A321 single aisle aircraft to meet growth on its domestic and regional network. The purchase agreement, covering 10 A321ceo and 10 A321neo, was signed in Hanoi today by Vietjet President and CEO, Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao and Fabrice Brégier, Airbus President & CEO.

The signing took place during the state visit to Vietnam of François Hollande, President of France, and was witnessed by Mr Hollande and Tran Dai Quang, President of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.

In addition to the new order, Vietjet and Airbus also finalised an agreement for the manufacturer to provide training services for flight crew and maintenance personnel at the airline’s new facility in Ho Chi Minh City. This will see Airbus oversee courses at the facility identical to those offered at the manufacturer’s own training centres.

At the signing ceremony, the President and CEO of Vietjet Nguyễn Thị Phương Thảo ‎shared: ""Vietjet is developing robustly and sustainably with an aim at better serving our passengers and promoting tourism and economic development in Vietnam and other regional countries. The friendly relationship in politics and culture between Vietnam and France has been nurtured through generations. Two countries are heading towards a more efficient economic cooperation of which today’s agreement of Vietjet and Airbus is a vivid example. We do take pride in and appreciate Airbus for their efforts and support since our operation. Thanks to our modern fleet with advanced designs, fuel efficiency as well as effective support in operations, training and system development, Vietjet will continue to realize passengers’ dreams of flying, to create a future in the air with an aim at making Vietjet become more and more popular globally.”

Trade authority rules Airbus got subsidies that hurt Boeing | HeraldNet.com - The Daily Herald,"Thu, 22 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlcmFsZG5ldC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvdS1zLWNsYWltcy13aW4taW4tZGlzcHV0ZS1vdmVyLWV1cm9wZWFuLWFlcm9zcGFjZS1zdWJzaWRpZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"EVERETT — The World Trade Organization said Thursday that Airbus is still benefiting from $22 billion in illegal government subsidies, an unfair advantage that has cost the Boeing Co. hundreds of airplane sales worth tens of billions of dollars.

The ruling is an important win in the United States’ long-running trade dispute with the European Union over whether the 28-country bloc is illegally helping airplane manufacturer Airbus.

The EU is expected to appeal, which could take as little as three months but likely will drag on for a year or more, a U.S. trade official said.

If the appeal fails, the U.S. could retaliate, with the WTO’s blessing, by imposing costly tariffs on EU goods and services.

A negotiated settlement between the EU and U.S. is also possible. U.S. trade officials have invited their counterparts to talk, but so far they’ve been rebuffed, U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Michael Froman said.

Boeing leaders praised the ruling and criticized the EU and Airbus for doubling down on bad behavior after the WTO ruled in June 2011 that the EU and four member states — Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Spain — had improperly given the airplane maker more than $17 billion in subsidized financing. While the EU subsequently claimed to have come into compliance, the United States disagreed and requested that a compliance panel intervene.

Thursday’s ruling from the WTO panel found that the EU had not only failed to remedy the prior unfair support, but member countries had piled on another $5 billion in illegal aid, including $4 billion to help launch Airbus’ A350 XWB, a competitor to Boeing’s 787.

The “day of reckoning” has finally arrived, Boeing Executive Vice President and General Counsel J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. “The World Trade Organization has now found that Airbus is and always has been a creature of government and of illegal government subsidy.”

Boeing CEO and Chairman Dennis Muilenburg called the ruling “historic” for holding the EU and rival Airbus “to account for their flouting of global trade rules.”

“This long-awaited decision is a victory for fair trade worldwide and for U.S. aerospace workers, in particular,” Muilenburg said.

The company’s statement went so far as to say that Airbus might not even exist today if not for continued support of European governments.

The panel found that the subsidies likely had cost Boeing hundreds of aircraft sales since 2006. Boeing lost 271 orders for its single-aisle 737 to the Airbus A320 family, as well as market share in the EU, Australia, China and India. Boeing lost 50 orders for its 767, 777 and 787 to Airbus’ A330, A340, and A350 XWB. The illegal subsidies led to Boeing losing 54 orders for the 747 to Airbus’ A380.

Boeing has struggled to get 747 orders in recent years, forcing it to significantly cut back production. With its waning market prospects, many industry experts expect the company will stop making the iconic airplane in the next few years.

The subsidies threaten the jobs of thousands of American aerospace workers, said Democratic U.S. Sen. Patty Murray. “Their livelihoods are at stake. The economy in my home state of Washington is at stake.”

The Obama administration claimed victory in the trade dispute, parts of which stretch back to Airbus’ creation more than 40 years ago. U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman called it “a sweeping victory for the United States and its aerospace workers.”

However, the U.S. did not run the table in its complaint with the WTO, an international body that helps resolve trade disputes. While the panel ruled mostly in America’s favor, it also found that EU financing was acceptable for some Airbus models.

Froman called on the EU, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Spain to “respect the WTO rules” and “end subsidized financing of Airbus immediately.”

The WTO is still considering the EU’s complaint alleging that Boeing received banned federal and state support in the U.S.

“Watch this space,” Airbus said in a statement in reaction to Thursday’s ruling. “Before year-end the record subsidies for the 777X will almost certainly be condemned as illegal,” it said, referring to a new Boeing airliner.

• EASA recognition lays the ground for civil certification of large UAS

After more than two years’ work Airbus Defence and Space has become the world’s first company to be approved by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) for the design and development of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) intended for civil type certification.

The company’s existing Design Organisation Approval (DOA) for conventional manned aircraft has been extended to cover UAS – the critical step in allowing it to achieve type certification for that class of aircraft.

The milestone was reached two years after its Atlante UAS became the first UAS to be submitted to EASA for civil certification.

EASA and Airbus Defence and Space have been working closely together to develop certification processes based on the existing system for manned aircraft and to agree new practice where no procedures were previously in place.

Jana Rosenmann, Head of UAS, Airbus Defence and Space said: “Establishing the UAS category in DOAs will be a key element in the regulatory regime needed to foster UAS development in Europe. As a company we are determined to maintain a leading industrial position in the civil UAS sector, but all players stand to benefit from the establishment of the optimum regulatory framework.”

The Singaporean national airline took delivery of its first five A380s on 10-year leases with options to extend.

On Wednesday, the airline announced that it will not renew the lease for the first of its Airbus superjumbos.

""The first (lease) expires in October 2017, and we have decided not to extend it,"" Singapore Airlines told Business Insider via email. ""This decision was the result of a regular review of our fleet requirements.""

As a result, Singapore's first A380 will be returned to its owners, Dr. Peters Group, once the lease runs out next October.

In addition, Singapore also said that it has not made up its mind on whether or not it will continue with the other four leased A380s.

A decision on fate of the remaining four leased superjumbos is expected to be made between now and April 2017, Aviation Week reported.

In total, Singapore Airlines operates the second largest A380 fleet in the world with 19- super-jumbos. The airline also has an additional order for five new A380s set to begin delivery late next year.

Over the past few years, Airbus has struggled mightily to find buyers for new A380s. It's a struggle that's now compounded by competition from the first group of off-lease A380s entering the second hand market.

In addition, Airbus also contends with A380s from current customers, such as Malaysia Airlines who is trying to dump its fleet of six superjumbos.

In a statement to Business Insider, Airbus wrote:

""We do not comment on the fleet plans of individual airlines. We are confident in the market for second hand A380s, which can be leased or acquired at attractive rates. This will offer a great opportunity for new entrants with new business models to start operating the A380.""

Today's news is not exactly welcomed by an already struggling A380 program that's fallen short of the paradigm shifting expectations Airbus had when the $428 million jet debuted more than a decade ago.

In July, Airbus announced at the Farnborough Air Show that it will slow down the production rate of the A380 by more than 50% starting in 2018.

Emirates remains the A380's largest and most influential customer. With 140 of the 319 A380 orders coming from the Dubai-based airline, the future of the aircraft is essentially pegged to Emirates.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999293088912964}",neutral,0.9999293088912964,0

Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones chooses Airbus Helicopters H145 - Vertical Magazine,"Fri, 09 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2RhbGxhcy1jb3dib3lzLW93bmVyLWplcnJ5LWpvbmVzLWNob29zZXMtYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLWgxNDUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Dallas Cowboys owner, president, and general manager Jerry Jones, leader of one of the world’s most recognizable professional sports franchises, has chosen a new, customized H145 corporate helicopter as his go-to business transportation tool.

Jones decided to purchase the H145 from Airbus Helicopters Inc. of Grand Prairie, Texas after a competition with other available helicopter models. The H145 is one of the newest and most technologically advanced models in the Airbus Helicopters product line.

The helicopter will provide Jones with a fast and smooth ride in a comfortable cabin that can seat eight to 10 passengers, depending on the configuration. With the new H145, Jones and his leadership team will be able to commute swiftly to and from the team’s headquarters complex at The Star, in Frisco, a suburban area north of Dallas, to AT&T Stadium in Arlington for games and other functions.

Jones, his staff, and his family will be flying above the Dallas-Fort Worth region’s traffic-snarled highways and road construction projects.

“This helicopter will save us valuable time, and allow members of our organization to work and live more efficiently,” said Jones.

When Jones took delivery of the new helicopter, he told Airbus Helicopters Inc. employees: “I’ve been so excited in anticipation of getting this helicopter. I see the quality and the pride that you put into it. It says Dallas Cowboys.”

With the helicopter’s ability to take off and land from nearby heliports and bypass the busy airports required by fixed wing aircraft, the H145 will enable Jones and his management team to travel swiftly and more conveniently for business.

The H145’s patented Fenestron shrouded tail rotor design makes it the quietest helicopter now in production, an important attribute for passengers and the people living below. The highly trained and experienced professionals of Airbus Helicopters Inc. installed the helicopter’s versatile, customized interior that was designed and produced to meet the Cowboys’ exact requirements.

Cabin floor carpeting and other luxury features are easily removable to allow the helicopters use on work trips to Jones’ ranch.

“Jerry Jones made an outstanding choice when he selected the superb Airbus Helicopters H145 to be his aircraft and to be the official helicopter of the iconic Dallas Cowboys, America’s Team,” said Christopher Emerson, president of Airbus Helicopters Inc.

“Our company has been the leader in U.S. helicopter sales for 15 consecutive years, and that is because of the commitment of our employees to not only build and support the helicopters but to take care of each customer. We’re not just selling helicopters; we’re providing a gratifying long-term experience.”

Airbus Helicopters Inc. began operations in Grand Prairie in 1969. In the last decade, the company has sold nearly as many helicopters as the combined total of its principal competitors. Airbus Helicopters products are the market leaders for air medical transport, law enforcement, airborne tourism, and in the corporate and VIP segment.

The company is a major supplier to the U.S. Army, the Coast Guard, and Customs and Border Protection. Texas Department of Public Safety is one of many state and local law enforcement agencies operating Airbus Helicopters products.

The U.S. Army, Navy and National Guard – including Texas Guard units – also fly a variant of the H145, called the UH-72A Lakota, for missions including training, search-and-rescue, disaster relief, and border security.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9981039762496948}",neutral,0.9981039762496948,0
"Hawaiian Airlines Wants to Be the First US Airline to Fly Airbus A380s, Because Why Exactly? - View from the Wing","Thu, 22 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9oYXdhaWlhbi1haXJsaW5lcy13YW50cy1maXJzdC11cy1haXJsaW5lLWZseS1haXJidXMtYTM4MHMtZXhhY3RseS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Japan’s Skymark Airlines was scheduled to take the A380, but it went bankrupt. ANA won Airbus’ support as a creditor to take control of Skymark — all they wanted was Skymark’s slots at Tokyo Haneda — by agreeing to accept the Skymark A380s. ANA says they’ll operate the planes to Honolulu.

No US airline has taken an A380. Many airlines regret theirs. It’s a big plane, expensive to operate, although cost-effective if you can fill it. The idea was to fly routes at slot-congested airports, like Tokyo Narita and London Heathrow, where an A380 could replace two smaller planes. But an airline that does that loses frequently, and becomes less convenient for time-sensitive business travelers. And adding seats to a market drives down the price the carrier can sell those seats for.

What’s more operating just a couple of planes is expensive, you need crews trained for the aircraft and you need parts and a maintenance program for the aircraft, the fixed costs of a plane type don’t get spread across a large number of aircraft. But it’s a niche player for most.

That’s a key reason that only Emirates has really made the Airbus A380 work. They fill planes with lots of passengers at low prices, and fly them long distances. And they have a lot of planes.

To paraphrase Jacques Lory in Casablanca, ‘the A380 is a drug on the market, everybody sells A380s, there are A380s everywhere.’

Singapore is returning its first five



Malaysia is trying to unload its six



Emirates itself is replacing the first 25 of theirs.

New A380s aren’t selling, the aircraft has been on the chopping block, and the used market is flooding with aircraft.

Against the backdrop of cheap A380s, and a bit of monkey see monkey do, Hawaiian Airlines is reportedly considering becoming the first US airline to operate the plane. (HT: One Mile at a Time)

Hawaiian Airlines is waiting to see whether six A330neo jetliners ordered from Airbus will enable it to begin service to Europe. The U.S. carrier also is looking at adding more routes to China and the eastern U.S., and examining whether it should consider acquiring the A380 superjumbo, according to its chief executive officer.

Hawaiian wants to fly to London, but they swapped A350 orders for A330s and they don’t know if those will have the range. And there are other routes for which they want greater range aircraft:

Southeast Asia is beyond the range of Hawaiian’s 23 current-generation A330s and nine Boeing Co. 767s, though more Australian flights would be an option, according to the CEO.

It sounds like what they really want, though, are either A350s (including potentially the upcoming A350ULR or ‘ultra long range’) or Boeing 787s. They could even potentially pick up Boeing 777-200LRs (long range) on the cheap with A350s as they replace the older Boeing at some carriers.

They could operate the A380 on Honolulu – Tokyo and Honolulu – Los Angeles, but they’d be giving up frequency on routes that are already competitive. They’d have to fill a giant plane with passengers willing to fly in a narrower range of times, likely driving down yield.

The question, it seems, is whether Hawaiian could secure the planes cheap enough to turn a stupid idea into one that’s merely dumb. And whether they remember, before copying ANA with an A380 on Honolulu – Tokyo (which ANA hasn’t done yet), that ANA doesn’t really want to do it but has to send the planes somewhere. Hawaiian doesn’t have to send A380s somewhere, since they don’t have any yet and would probably be well-advised to not get any.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999802112579346}",neutral,0.9999802112579346,0

In a report issued on Wednesday, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau has determined how an Air Asia X wide-body jet wound up in a city thousands of miles away from its destination.

On March 10, 2015, an Air Asia X Airbus took off from Sydney for a scheduled flight to Kuala Lumpur. However, instead of flying to Malaysia, the Airbus A330-343X landed in Melbourne, 500 miles southwest of Sydney.

According to the ATSB, the Captain of the flight input the wrong coordinates for Sydney Airport into the jet's flight navigation system.

The error wreaked havoc on the A330's advanced flight management and guidance systems.

""The longitude was incorrectly entered as 01519.8 east (15° 19.8’ east) instead of 15109.8 east (151° 9.8’ east),"" The ATSB wrote in its report. ""This resulted in a positional error in excess of 6,835 miles, which adversely affected the aircraft’s navigation systems and some alerting systems.""

Instead of Sydney, the coordinates entered by the Captain placed the flight's point of origin some where off the coast of Cape Town, South Africa, the report indicated.

Unfortunately, the pilots did not realize they made an error until after the aircraft took off and began to fly in the wrong direction.

""Despite a number of opportunities to identify and correct the error, it was not noticed until after the aircraft became airborne and started tracking in the wrong direction,"" investigators wrote.

Even worse, the pilots' attempts to correct the matter managed further deteriorate the situation.

""Attempts to troubleshoot and rectify the problem resulted in further degradation of the navigation system, as well as to the aircraft’s flight guidance and flight control systems,"" the ATSB wrote.

Eventually, the pilots elected to abort the flight and return to Sydney. However, weather prevented the flight from doing so, and the flight crew elected to divert to Melbourne. No injuries have been reported relating to this incident.

According to the report, both members of the flight crew were experienced pilots. The Captain has more than 22,000 hours of flying under his belt while the first officer has 2,200 hours of experience.

In a statement to Business Insider, Air Asia X wrote:

""With reference to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) report published today regarding an incident involving an AirAsia X Airbus A330 aircraft with registration number 9M-XXM bound for Kuala Lumpur from Sydney on 10 March 2015, AirAsia X would like to confirm that we have taken the following corrective actions immediately following the incident, and prior to the publication of today's ATSB report:



• All AirAsia X aircraft have been equipped with upgraded flight management systems since the incident



• Development of a training bulletin and package for flight crew that emphasises correct operation and alignment of air data and inertial reference system



• Briefing all pilots on our internal investigation findings and reviewing recovery procedures to be undertaken



AirAsia X would like to stress that we have in place robust management systems to monitor and prevent similar incidents from reoccurring.



We also wish to reiterate that we have regularly passed safety and security audits conducted by various international regulators, including the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA). We remain committed to ensuring our compliance to all safety and security regulations.



The safety of all guests and crew are our utmost priority at all times.""

Despite this incident, Malaysia-based Air Asia X is considered one of the best low cost airlines in the world. The long haul arm of Tony Fernandes' Air Asia airline empire was recently rated as the sixth best low cost airline in the world by consumer aviation website Skytrax.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9550036787986755}",negative,0.9550036787986755,-1

APEX Insight: An A350 XWB cabin is a vessel for the onboard experience. There are thousands of options. Airbus’ Customer Definition Centre is where airlines are guided to find the right one for them.

Looking down the seemingly never-ending hall, most visitors are in awe when they enter the Inspire Room, the centerpiece of Airbus‘ A350 XWB Customer Definition Centre (CDC). For effect, it’s almost pitch-black inside. The only light emanates from high-set screens that run the length of the room, looping satellite footage of the Earth at night. Light beams bloom from London, Beijing and Dubai, representing departing flights from the world’s megacities. They bounce from screen to screen in rhythm with sparse, ethereal music. To the visitor, it feels as if you’re floating in outer space, reflecting on the state of air travel and the potential it holds.

“If you just put seats in here without any story behind them, that would be boring.” €” Ingo Wuggetzer, Airbus

A row of rooms lines each side of the hall, each concealing a unique concept of what a cabin interior could look like. Inside fuselage number one is T Airways, a cabin with subdued colors that might cater to business-attired professionals, whose in-flight agendas involve Wi-Fi and in-seat power. Fuselage number two holds Fun Air, an interior with rainbow-hued seats that might cater to vacationers, who order mai tais en route to their tropical destinations. “We create a theme of what the virtual airline is about and then we apply it in the fabrics, in the design, in the seats to create a real specific atmosphere that inspires customers,” says Ingo Wuggetzer, vice-president, Cabin Marketing, Airbus. “If you just put seats in here without any story behind them, that would be boring.”

A Personal Greeting

The CDC is where airlines go to outfit their A350 cabin interiors. Guests are invited to stay at on-site apartments while they spend their days roaming the many rooms in the building, exploring, learning and picking the finishings to personalize their aircraft. Representatives from Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines and Finnair may have been among the site’s first visitors. Subtle industrial design details, such as a decorative hardwood circle on the floor in the exact diameter of an A350 fuselage, enhance the experience. “The building itself is a real tool,” says Eric Ezell, head of the CDC. “The architecture is defined by the A350 XWB definition process.”

Airbus sets the tone for the experience by placing the country flag of every incoming airline at the welcome desk. Lounges, prayer rooms and other amenities also help to make guests feel at home during their stay. Even the decorative LED wall that displays more than 16 million colors, showcasing the A350’s sophisticated cabin lighting system, is set to reflect the airline’s brand color.

“When customers come to the CDC … it’s not where things start,” Ezell says. “It’s basically where things come together.”

Located within the Hamburg Aviation complex, the site is in close proximity to aerospace partners, which helps to accelerate any processes that involve suppliers. “The customer only has to travel once to find all the customization elements and tools under one roof, including the experts of Airbus and risk-sharing partners to answer all their questions,” Ezell explains.

Gone are the Excel charts, the slideshows and the endless scheduling of meetings that used to overwhelm the definition process. Inside the CDC, decisions are fast-forwarded through highly intelligent software, virtual reality, 3-D walkthroughs and physical mock-ups that enable customers to envision many cabin interiors before choosing the right one. Take, for example, the touchscreen kiosk that scrolls through a multitude of materials and color combinations for a lavatory countertop in just a few minutes. “Normally, it would have taken months just to make a decision on some specific topics,” says Wuggetzer. Now, the entire process takes only about 12 months. “If there is a certain solution you have in mind, but are not sure about, we can build it like Lego pieces, do it virtually or do it in real size, one-to-one ratio to find the best solution fast.”

“If there is a certain solution you have in mind … we can build it like Lego pieces, do it virtually or do it in real size, one-to-one ratio to find the best solution fast.” €” Ingo Wuggetzer, Airbus

Much like a shopping mall, separate rooms and areas focus on specific design elements for the A350 XWB. In the Design Studio, customers can get a feel for the textures and textiles of different trim and finish themes, from Exotic Fusion to Modern Simplicity. Inside the Play Room, the latest in-flight entertainment options from Panasonic Avionics, Thales and Zodiac are on full display. “The purpose is to help airlines find their perfect cabin interior, down to whether or not they need a couple of inches more or less,” says Wuggetzer.

Artificial Natural Environment

Testing things in their physical space, simulating the cabin environment as accurately as possible, is imperative. Jet engine noise, for example, dampens unpleasant sounds. During one visit, a customer remarked that the mechanical screeching of a trash compactor seemed exceptionally loud. Airbus employees realized that on an airplane, the hum of the jet engine muffles the sound – so they added a feature that simulates the aural in-flight atmosphere to account for this. Now, when Wuggetzer demonstrates the trash compactor, he pushes a button that starts a jet engine murmur, reducing the compactor sound with white noise.

Cabin lighting is also a factor when imitating the onboard experience. An airline may request a complete dinner setup with food and tableware to see how various colors might affect passengers’ appetites. Even if a fish fillet is grilled to perfection, placed under green light, it can be off-putting. Amber is the best hue for in-flight mealtime, much like the candlelit ambience of a fine restaurant.

“You [can] test, feel and define everything in relation to each other.” – Eric Ezell, Airbus

Even picking out a galley kitchen can involve multiple trials. An airline may bring several trays of the same meal and conduct blind taste tests to determine which oven masters the art of heating broccoli, chicken penne or coffee to just the right temperature. “Everything is possible,” Ezell says, referring to the CDC’s various labs. “It’s a working environment that allows you to test, feel and define everything in relation to each other.”

Depth Perception

Once parts of the cabin have been defined, airlines can see their A350s come together through the magic of virtual reality. This happens in the A350 XWB Cabin Concept Centre, located a stone’s throw from Airbus’ CDC, which is also in the Hamburg Aviation complex. By projecting a cabin interior mock-up on three sides of a rectangular room, plus the ceiling and the floor, Airbus customers can get a sense of the space, can physically walk through transitions between cabin classes or see the difference between a nine- and 10-abreast configuration, for example. “Virtual reality really allows us to dive into the individual cabin layout,” Ezell says. “Here we can fully reflect the customer’s selection.”

All the materials and options that were selected during the definition process, including countertops, fabric and in-flight entertainment hardware, can be realized through virtual reality, down to the logo on the headrest cover. But defining a cabin doesn’t end with a three-dimensional digital rendering. “With light and trim and finishings on screens, you always have to keep in mind that projections can give a slightly different color character. In the end, you want to see the real thing, the real material in your hands to validate it,” Ezell says. “Some questions cannot even be validated on the screen, because it has to do with human interface with the machine, with accessibility of cabin situations, maneuverability of the trolley or the luggage,” Wuggetzer adds.

One of the final stages of the definition process is the Configure Room, where the A350 cabin is mocked up in one-to-one ratio. “It’s like a Lego room,” Wuggetzer says. In here, everything is white, stripped of all trims and finishings; it’s all about shape, size and fit. Colored markings along a guided track on the floor indicate setups for various seat pitches and configurations, letting customers test their seats in their chosen layout. When everything is in place, they get a tangible feel for how tall they stand next to a monument, whether it’s too difficult to roll a loaded trolley around a certain corner, or whether a baby bassinet prevents passengers from moving easily in and out of their seats.

It’s a cathartic moment for everyone. “It works so perfectly,” Wuggetzer says about the room. “We have seen so many happy people in here … We did not expect this to be a highlight of all the tours.”

Turning the Inside Out

For the design of the A350 XWB, Airbus drew some of its inspiration from a phenomenon born in the last decade – social media – where passengers most like to rant about airlines. The goal was to better understand not just their customers (airlines), but their customers’ customers (passengers), allowing the “personal” to influence the thinking behind cabin design. Launched in 2014, the A350 has a quieter cabin, expanded 18-inch-wide seats, seatback screens up to 12 inches wide, larger overhead bins and larger windows that let in more natural light. Collectively, the features make up the portfolio of Airspace, the new cabin product that has opened the possibility for greater personalization in the A330neo, and eventually other cabins, too.

In the age of personalization, it’s no coincidence that Boeing opened its own 787 Dreamliner Gallery in 2007 in Everett, Washington, to help its customers brand their cabins. The trend affects all industries. Steve Jobs made it literal by putting the “i” in iPod, iPhone and iPad. For airlines, it’s big data that has allowed them to identify passengers beyond their seat number, such as knowing a passenger’s frequent flyer status or if that person might be celebrating a birthday in the skies. But how do passengers discern one onboard experience from the next when there are so many airlines to choose from? It’s showing what’s on the inside that counts.

Need a lift?

Airbus is always thinking. Sometimes it’s coming up with newfangled seating concepts for shoe-horning more people into plane cabins or catering to the differently-sized, a.k.a fat people. Other times it’s prototyping a killer multi-million dollar VIP helicopter.



The aviation giant recently filed a patent for a hybrid electric plane with vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capabilities, thanks to at least two hub rotors on each side of the fuselage. Another propeller would give it regular horizontal cruising capabilities.



Obviously an aircraft with that kind of lift, speed and range would have amazing potential in military and medical scenarios. But we’d just as soon make it our go-to transport for getting to and from our favorite yacht. With the right flight attendants aboard, that’d be quite a tender service…

These allegations related to irregularities concerning third party consultants.

On 31 January 2020, the Serious Fraud Office entered into a record-breaking Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the global aerospace company Airbus SE following its approval by Dame Victoria Sharp, President of the Queen’s Bench Division. The indictment, which has been suspended for the term of the DPA, covers five counts of failure to prevent bribery and involved Airbus’ Commercial and Defence & Space divisions. The conduct covered by the UK DPA took place across five jurisdictions: Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan and Ghana between 2011 and 2015.

Under the terms of the DPA, Airbus SE agreed to pay a fine, disgorgement of profits and costs amounting to €991m here in the UK, and in total, €3.6bn as part the world’s largest global resolution for bribery, involving authorities in France and the United States. On the same day as entering into a DPA with the SFO, Airbus SE also reached a Convention Judiciaire d’Intérêt Public with the Parquet National Financier (PNF) and a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the US Department of Justice and US Department of State. In total, these agreements together with the SFO DPA required Airbus SE to pay approximately €3.6 billion (including €2,083,137,455 to the PNF and €525,655,000 to the US authorities) at the exchange rate at time of payment. Please see the full press release here. The DPA, Statement of Facts and Judgment of Dame Victoria Sharp can be found here.

In February 2020, Airbus SE paid its financial penalty, disgorgement and costs to the SFO. In GBP, this figure was £830m in total, comprising of disgorgement of profits of £491m, financial penalty of £333m, and the SFO’s reasonable costs of £6m. This has been transferred to the Treasury for onward transmission.

Airbus Helicopters delivers first AS565 MBe Panther to Mexican Navy - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 29 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1cy1oZWxpY29wdGVycy1kZWxpdmVycy1maXJzdC1hczU2NS1tYmUtcGFudGhlci1tZXhpY2FuLW5hdnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Mexican Navy recently took delivery of the first of the 10 AS565 MBe Panther helicopters it purchased in 2014, becoming the first customer in the world to receive the new version of this multi-role, medium-class military rotorcraft. The Navy will receive three other units before the end of the year and the remaining six by early 2018.

The helicopters will be operated by the Naval Aviation in the Gulf of Mexico and on the Pacific coast, where they will perform a range of missions including search-and-rescue (SAR), disaster relief transportation and evacuation, drug enforcement and coastal protection.

The AS565 MBe combines new and proven technologies to offer more value to operators. It is equipped with two Safran Arriel 2N engines, which enhance its performance in hot and high conditions and enable it to achieve a top speed of 278 kilometers per hour and a range of 780 kilometers. It also boasts a new main gearbox, a latest-generation tail rotor and a four-axis autopilot that reduces crew workload and makes the most demanding missions, such as SAR, easier to perform.

More powerful and efficient, the AS565 MBe is also safer, more cost-effective and easier to operate.

“The Mexican Navy’s first Panther helicopters came into service 10 years ago,” said vice admiral Jose Maria García Macedo. “Since then they have been our most loyal ally when it comes to saving lives, and it gives us great pleasure to expand our fleet with the more modern version of the same aircraft.

“Thanks to the state-of-the-art technology on board, the new helicopters will enhance Naval Aviation’s operational and response capability, enabling us to carry out maritime safety missions both day and night, in any weather and in heavy seas.”

Mexican Naval Aviation’s AS565 MBe Panthers fulfill NATO’s regulatory requirements in performing landings on moving ships 24 hours a day, and are thus able to operate right across Mexico’s territorial waters. Their equipment suite includes a main- and tail-rotor blade folding system, a deck-lock harpoon and an emergency flotation system.

“Naval Aviation carries out its rescue missions in the most demanding operating conditions, and we are grateful for its renewed confidence in our helicopters,” said Mesrob Karalekian, Airbus Helicopters’ vice president for Latin America. “The contract also includes training of pilots and technicians to provide the Navy with full autonomy in managing its fleet and optimizing the availability of helicopters.”

The recent delivery of the first AS565 MBe Panther is an important milestone for Airbus Helicopters and for this iconic family of helicopters, which includes 1,000 helicopters currently in service in over 72 countries and have logged up 5.8 million flight hours.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9049956202507019}",positive,0.9049956202507019,1
Norwegian Air choosing Airbus over Boeing - Business Insider,"Sun, 18 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbm9yd2VnaWFuLWJvZWluZy03NTctYWlyYnVzLTMyMS1uZW8tbHItMjAxNi050gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9ub3J3ZWdpYW4tYm9laW5nLTc1Ny1haXJidXMtMzIxLW5lby1sci0yMDE2LTk_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Norwegian Air is making waves in the airline industry.

Recently, Norwegian Air Chief Commercial Officer Thomas Ramdahl told Business Insider in an interview his airline plans to launch $69 fares on trans-Atlantic flights starting next year.

As a long-time Boeing customer, Norwegian selected the new generation 737 MAX 8 to launch the new fare.

In fact, the airline, which currently operates a fleet made up exclusively of more than 100 Boeing jets, has 100 of the planes on order.

But there's more to this story.

Even though the 737 Max has a range of about 4,000 miles, there are routes where Norwegian will need greater range than the plane can deliver but won't require the services of a pricey wide-body jet.

In other words, Norwegian is in need of a 'tweener.

Traditionally, those routes have been the domain of Boeing's 757. However, Boeing discontinued the controversial plane in 2004 and still does not have an aircraft capable of matching its capabilities, although Boeing did tell Business Insider that it is currently studying the possibility of a 757 replacement.

That's where the 30 A321neo LR jets Norwegian ordered from Boeing's arch rival, Airbus, come into play.

""From the figures I've seen so far, the A321neo LR will have longer range than the MAX, so that gives us opportunities in smaller cities where frequency is more important than having a large wide-body jet,"" Ramdahl said.

While some airlines are holding onto their aging fleets of 757s, Norwegian seems to believe that it may have found a worthy successor for the long-serving jet.

Related stories

""It's difficult to say yes or no, but I think so,"" Ramdahl told us when asked if the A321neo LR is a true replacement for the 757. ""It's interesting to see if Boeing is coming up with a replacement for the 757 as well, because they'll need to if the LR does what Airbus is saying it will do.""

In fact, Ramdahl told us that the A321neo offers 10% to 15% lower costs per seat than a wide-body jet.

Based on Airbus' projected range of more than 4,600 miles, the A321neo LR should be able to match or beat the 757's range, the Norwegian executive told Business Insider. In addition, Norwegian Air's A321's are expected to be equipped with 220 to 230 seats — which is on par with the capacity of the 757-200.

A La Compagnie Boeing 757-200. La Compagnie

This is potentially distressing news for Boeing.

Even though the segment traditionally occupied by the 757 is not as large as the 737s or as profitable as the large wide-bodies, there is still plenty of demand for airplanes of its type. With the LR outselling its Boeing rival — the 737 MAX 9 — 5 to 1, it looks like Airbus is the only one with a truly competitive product on offer in the segment.

And if a major, long-time customer like Norwegian is willing to defect, then it certainly stacks the deck against Boeing when it comes to drawing customers.

The 737 MAX jets features new fuel-efficient CFM LEAP-1B engines, upgraded avionics, and aerodynamics. It's one of the most advanced and efficient airliners in the world. The A321neo LR also features upgraded avionics and aerodynamics but is equipped with a more powerful CFM LEAP-1A engine.

However, Boeing is not in a position to simply bolt on larger engines to match the A321neo LR's range, because there is a direct correlation between the diameter of a turbofan engine's fan blades and the amount of thrust the engine can produce. For example, the more powerful 1A engine's fan blades have a diameter of 78 inches — 9 more than the 1B.

A Norwegian Boeing 737 MAX 8. Boeing

An upgrade to a larger engine will likely involve a redesign of the 737's landing gear. That's because the 737 was designed in the 1960s to be powered by Pratt & Whitney's JT8D engine with a much more compact fan diameter of 49 inches.

Since then, Boeing has been bolting larger and larger engines onto the 737, but the under-wing space has not changed. The 737 has essentially maxed out on the engine size that can fit under its wings. As a result, Boeing will have to raise and relocate the plane's landing gear.

Advertisement

This means that whether it decides to modify the 737 or to build a new plane from scratch, it'll be a move that will likely cost billions.

Norwegian expects to take delivery of its 737 MAX 8 in 2017, with the first A321neo LR expected in 2019.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998995065689087}",neutral,0.9998995065689087,0
L-3 Communications to Supply Airbus Flight Simulator to ANA - Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 22 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHA6Ly9maW5hbmNlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2wtMy1jb21tdW5pY2F0aW9ucy1zdXBwbHktYWlyYnVzLTEzMjgwMTYyOC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"L-3 Communications Inc. LLL announced that its unit, Commercial Training Solutions (L-3 CTS), has received a contract from All Nippon Airways (ANA) to build and deliver an Airbus EADSY A320 Full Flight Simulator (FFS).



The flight simulator is a cost-effective way of training pilots in light of a potential surge in air travel over the next two decades.



First RealitySeven A320 FFS for ANA



The Airbus A320 FFS will be based on L-3 Communications’ RealitySeven flight training simulation solution and will be installed at ANA’s Tokyo, Japan training facility. The device will be ready to provide training to pilots starting Sep 2017.



The RealitySeven A320 FFS will join an existing RealitySeven B787 FFS at ANA’s training center. ANA’s existing fleet currently consists of aircraft manufactured by The Boeing Company BA and Airbus. So, training pilots in an A320 stimulator will help familiarize them with the real equipment.

L-3 COMM HLDGS Price

Why L-3 Communications?



L-3 Communications was selected to supply the flight stimulator on the back of its high-quality solutions and support, which will allow ANA to meet its pilot training requirements.



Previously, L-3 CTS had delivered commercial training solutions to customers in North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and the Pacific Rim. The unit specializes in a full spectrum of state-of-the-art training solutions, including ab-initio training, airline training, training centers and high-fidelity simulation products.



Our View



ANA has recently faced troubles with the 787 Dreamliner and is planning to replace nearly 100 Rolls Royce Engines in its existing 787 fleet. The ongoing issues with the Boeing planes could be diverting ANA’s attention toward Airbus.



Per the outlook provided by Boeing, from the present to 2035, the aviation industry will require more than two million new aviation personnel, including 617,000 commercial airline pilots, 679,000 maintenance technicians and 814,000 cabin crew.



Clearly, flight simulators will be the need of the hour during this period. Going forward, we expect L-3 CTS to witness a steady stream of orders from customers across the globe with this rise in demand for flight simulators.

The Airbus A380 just got some bad news from its second largest customer - Yahoo Finance,"Wed, 14 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHA6Ly9maW5hbmNlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLWp1c3QtZ290LWJhZC0xNjU5Mjk1MTkuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An Airbus A380-841 airplane of Singapore Airlines takes-off from Zurich airport, Switzerland, April 14, 2016. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann

On October 25, 2007, the Airbus A380 entered commercial service with a flight operated by Singapore Airlines.

The Singaporean national airline took delivery of its first five A380s on 10-year leases with options to extend.

On Wednesday, the airline announced that it will not renew the lease for the first of its Airbus superjumbos.

""The first (lease) expires in October 2017, and we have decided not to extend it,"" Singapore Airlines told Business Insider via email. ""This decision was the result of a regular review of our fleet requirements.""

As a result, Singapore's first A380 will be returned to its owners, Dr. Peters Group, once the lease runs out next October.

In addition, Singapore also said that it has not made up its mind on whether or not it will continue with the other four leased A380s.

A decision on fate of the remaining four leased superjumbos is expected to be made between now and April 2017, Aviation Week reported.

In total, Singapore Airlines operates the second largest A380 fleet in the world with 19- super-jumbos. The airline also has an additional order for five new A380s set to begin delivery late next year.

Over the past few years, Airbus has struggled mightily to find buyers for new A380s. It's a struggle that's now compounded by competition from the first group of off-lease A380s entering the second hand market.

In addition, Airbus also contends with A380s from current customers, such as Malaysia Airlines who is trying to dump its fleet of six superjumbos.

In a statement to Business Insider, Airbus wrote:

""We do not comment on the fleet plans of individual airlines. We are confident in the market for second hand A380s, which can be leased or acquired at attractive rates. This will offer a great opportunity for new entrants with new business models to start operating the A380.""

Today's news is not exactly welcomed by an already struggling A380 program that's fallen short of the paradigm shifting expectations Airbus had when the $428 million jet debuted more than a decade ago.

Story continues

In July, Airbus announced at the Farnborough Air Show that it will slow down the production rate of the A380 by more than 50% starting in 2018.

Emirates remains the A380's largest and most influential customer. With 140 of the 319 A380 orders coming from the Dubai-based airline, the future of the aircraft is essentially pegged to Emirates.

When it's made by aerospace engineers. Innovation giant that it is, Airbus has a lot of side projects and one such project is the Light Rider. They call the Light Rider the first* 3D printed motorcycle, and its design boasts all about it.

Enter a caption (optional)

This skeletal bike was developed and executed by Airbus subsidiary APWorks, to show the structural offerings of their cutting edge 3D metal printing and additive methods. It's made from the company's fictional-sounding material Scalmalloy, which is nearly as strong as titanium and resistant to corroding.

While the frame looks like an impossibly airy student drawing, it is strong and stiff enough to handle the torque and load of a sporty ride. The 6kW electric motor gets up to 80kph in seconds, it can last around 60 km on a battery, all while weighing just 35 kg/77 lbs. It's certainly no race bike, but they claim its power to weight ratio puts it on par with supercars...which sounds cool, though I doubt this initial design has been put through quite as many speed, handling and safety tests.

And the webby, ALIENesque style isn't just fanciful futurism. The design's organic look was created with algorithms based on naturally occurring structures with impressive strength-to-weight ratios. Think bird bones, or coral. With lower weight and less restrictive manufacturing, electric bikes might get more attractive and bizarre looking than ever.

The first run is limited to 50 outrageously expensive bikes, but APWorks hopes to produce further iterations. They anticipate refining the design to make it cool and affordable enough to putter on from your space job to the space bar, like a sexy space Vespa.

Airbus Helicopters hands over first Mexican Panther MBe - Flightglobal,"Wed, 28 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLWhhbmRzLW92ZXItZmlyc3QtbWV4aWNhbi1wYW50aGVyLW1iZS8xMjE4NDAuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters has handed over the first AS565 Panther MBe to the Mexican navy, with the aircraft to be delivered to a base near the Gulf of Mexico for training in the next two weeks.

Revealed during a ceremony at the company’s Marignane site in the south of France on 28 September, the aircraft is the first of 10 on order for Mexico, which will add to its current fleet of four Panther MB variants.

At the request of the navy, the aircraft has been delivered nine months ahead of schedule – a development which will ensure that all its new rotorcraft will be handed over ahead of a presidential change in Mexico in December 2018.

After the first example is delivered to Mexico via a Boeing 747 freighter at the beginning of October for training, another Panther MBe is expected to follow later the same month, followed by a further two during November. The remaining six are scheduled to be transferred in 2017.

Four of the aircraft had originally been due for delivery next year, followed by a final pair in 2018, but Vice Adm Jose Garcia Macedo, general coordinator of Mexican naval aeronautics, says he is confident that the entire order will be completed by the end of next year, as now planned.

Mexican pilots are currently training at Airbus Helicopters’ Singapore facility, undergoing conversion ahead of the type's delivery. As the aircraft arrives in Mexico, the pilots will carry out 10h of live training, to complete their type qualification.

“We are on track, and the second helicopter is already painted,” Janick Blanc, vice-president of the Dauphin and H155 programme at Airbus Helicopters, says. “It was a great challenge for us to deliver ahead of the contract,” he adds.

Beth Stevenson/FlightGlobal

The MBe model benefits from Safran Helicopter Engines Arriel 2N powerplants, new avionics and an increased payload – increasing maximum take-off weight to 4,500kg (9,910b), from 4,300kg.

The second customer for the type is Indonesia, which has 11 on order, for delivery by 2018. Three will be delivered to Indonesian company PTDI in November, with this to integrate an indigenously-developed sonar onto two of the airframes.

Blanc says that the acceleration of the Mexican order has also helped to move the Indonesian programme ahead of schedule, and attributes this to the “lean production line” at the Marignane facility, which is now producing one of the aircraft per month.

The next potential market for the Panther MBe is India, where it is being proposed for a Naval Utility Helicopter (NUH) programme, which is expected to deliver 110 aircraft.

“This is very important for us… it is our next fight and we are in very good shape,” Blanc says. “We have a good product and can respond to their requirements.”

A request for information was released at the end of 2015, and a request for proposals is expected in six months’ time, Blanc says.

The recent purchase of 36 Dassault Rafale fighters for India could spur New Delhi to accelerate its NUH programme, Blanc says, noting: “Now the contract is done [for Rafale] we hope it will add a new dynamic to priorities.”

Airbus will partner with Mahindra for the Indian bid, and it is expected that production could eventually be carried out in-country.

Some 50% of the work has to be carried out in India according to programme rules, but “we are at a very early stage in discussions”, Blanc says.

“That [moving production to India] is something that we are thinking about,” he adds.

Other requirements that Airbus could target with the MBe is a German navy requirement for an anti-submarine warfare rotorcraft, while Blanc says that there is interest from one customer in each of the Middle Eastern, South American and Central American markets.

There are 194 Airbus 380 superjumbos flying around the world with more than a dozen airlines.

Currently, none of those jets fly for an airline from the United States.

But that may soon change.

In an interview with Bloomberg's Christopher Jasper, Hawaiian Airlines CEO Mark Dunkerley said his airline is seriously considering the Airbus A380 double-decker jet as a possible addition to the company's fleet.

According to Bloomberg, Hawaiian is considering adding the superjumbo for routes from Honolulu to cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Tokyo. Hawaiian currently services these cities with its fleet of Airbus A330 and Boeing 767 wide-body jets.

However, Dunkerley added that his airline is still not fully convinced by the A380's business case.

American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines have all declined to take on the massive airliner.

The Airbus A380 — which carries a list price of $432.6 million, brand new — is the most expensive airliner in the world. However, with the first batch of secondhand A380s coming into the market over the next year or so, there will likely be tremendous opportunities for airlines to scoop up these planes for pennies on the dollar.

Hawaiian Airlines

Last week, Singapore Airlines announced it would not extend the lease for the first of its A380s, while the struggling Malaysia Airlines has been trying to dump its fleet of superjumbos for some time.

Airbus has found it difficult in recent years to find new buyers for the jet. In January, the European aviation giant ended a yearslong sales drought for the jet when Japan's All Nippon Airways purchased three A380s. In addition, Iran Air has agreed to take on 12 of the planes as part of a massive $25 billion, 118-aircraft order.

So far, Airbus has 319 orders for the double-decker jet — 140 of which have come from Dubai-based Emirates Airlines.

Carrier to operate world’s newest widebody on non-stop services to US

Vietnam Airlines has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Airbus for 10 more A350-900 aircraft. The aircraft will be used by the airline on non-stop flights to the US, beginning with services between Ho Chi Minh City and Los Angeles.The MOU was signed in Hanoi today by Duong Tri Thanh, President and CEO of Vietnam Airlines, and Fabrice Brégier, Airbus President & CEO. The signing took place during the state visit to Vietnam of François Hollande, President of France, and was witnessed by Mr Hollande and Tran Dai Quang, President of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.Vietnam Airlines last year became the first airline in East Asia and the second in the world to operate the A350 XWB. The carrier already has four aircraft in service, with another 10 on firm order for future delivery. The additional 10 aircraft covered by today’s MOU will enable Vietnam Airlines to operate non-stop to the US West Coast, carrying 305 passengers in a three class premium layout.“The intention to acquire these additional aircraft reflects our excellent experience with the A350 since it entered service with Vietnam Airlines last year,” said Duong Tri Thanh, President and CEO of Vietnam Airlines. “With its very long range capability, economic fuel consumption and spacious cabin, the A350 is the suitable aircraft for our proposed intercontinental routes to Europe and the US. The start of non-stop transpacific services with the A350 is yet another example of the commitment we have at Vietnam Airlines to strengthen our position as one of the world’s leading international carriers.”“Today’s agreement further consolidates the A350’s position as the new long haul leader in the mid-size widebody category,” said Fabrice Brégier, Airbus President and CEO. “The A350 XWB has quite simply set new standards in its class, combining unbeatable operating economics with the highest levels of passenger comfort. We look forward to working closely with Vietnam Airlines as it continues to develop its long haul network and strengthens its position in the premium market.”The all-new A350 XWB features the latest aerodynamic design, carbon fibre fuselage and wings, plus fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines. Together, these latest technologies translate into unrivalled levels of operational efficiency, with a 25 per cent reduction in fuel burn and emissions, and significantly lower maintenance costs. For passengers, the A350 XWB sets new standard in terms of in-flight comfort, with an extra-wide cabin offering more personal space in all classes, including 18 inch wide seats as standard in economy class.To date, Airbus has recorded a total of 810 firm orders for the A350 XWB from 43 customers worldwide, already making it one of the most successful widebody aircraft ever.

A320neo Engine Shortages Threaten to Trip Up Airbus - Fox Business,"Thu, 22 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2EzMjBuZW8tZW5naW5lLXNob3J0YWdlcy10aHJlYXRlbi10by10cmlwLXVwLWFpcmJ1c9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2EzMjBuZW8tZW5naW5lLXNob3J0YWdlcy10aHJlYXRlbi10by10cmlwLXVwLWFpcmJ1cy5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Last week, United Technologies (NYSE: UTX) CEO Gregory Hayes acknowledged that his company would miss its goal of building 200 Pratt & Whitney PW1000G series jet engines in 2016. The company now expects to deliver about 150 units of the cutting-edge geared turbofan engine this year.

That's not good news for Airbus (NASDAQOTH: EADSY). While the European aircraft giant has maintained its deliveries guidance for 2016, it could have trouble executing a smooth ramp-up of A320neo production if Pratt & Whitney's production problems continue.

Engine shortages are constraining A320neo production. Image source: Airbus.

An aggressive plan

United Technologies has invested more than $10 billion to develop the new Pratt & Whitney engines, which have been highly anticipated within the airline industry. The company's geared turbofan technology provides huge fuel-efficiency improvements relative to older aircraft engines.

This has helped Pratt & Whitney gain a roughly 50% share of A320neo engine orders. (The PW1000G is also the sole engine choice for several smaller aircraft programs.) In total, the United Technologies subsidiary has a backlog of more than 7,000 geared turbofan engines.

To meet this backlog, Pratt & Whitney has planned an aggressive production ramp-up. After shipping 14 geared turbofans last year, it aimed to raise annual production to 200 this year, 400 in 2017, and 1,000 by 2020. It is slipping behind that timeline due to production issues affecting a handful of parts, most notably the fan blades.

United Technologies has also acknowledged that its 2017 engine production could be as low as 350 units, compared to its target of 400. The company hopes to make up the shortfall by 2018, but that will be challenging in light of the massive production increases already required.

Airbus holds guidance steady

Despite the geared turbofan production problems, Airbus still expects to deliver at least 650 jets this year. It plans to make up any shortfall of A320neo deliveries by building more current-generation A320s.

That shouldn't be too difficult for Airbus, because the A320neo represents a tiny fraction of overall A320-series production this year. Additionally, with fuel prices remaining low, some airlines that ordered the A320neo would be happy to take current-generation A320s instead (for the right price).

The bigger risk for Airbus is if Pratt & Whitney can't get back on schedule with its production ramp-up. Airbus plans to phase out production of the current-generation A320 by 2019 while also increasing monthly production of single-aisle airplanes by about 30% from today's level. That doesn't leave any slack for engine production shortfalls.

For now, Airbus says it is confident that Pratt & Whitney will deliver on its commitments. Pratt & Whitney is clearly working hard to get production running smoothly and it has decades of experience in the aircraft engine business. But as with any new technology, unexpected problems are a significant risk.

For United Technologies, cost is key

Lower geared turbofan deliveries could actually be good for United Technologies' bottom line this year. As of June, it cost $10 million to build each engine: far more than the typical sales price. The unit cost must eventually fall to around $2 million for Pratt & Whitney to hit its long-term margin target.

However, a smooth production ramp-up is essential for meeting this cost reduction goal. Furthermore, if getting production back on schedule proves to be costly -- either due to expensive fixes or the cost of compensating disgruntled customers -- it will make a big dent in United Technologies' cash flow, as the new engines are still years away from making a profit.

Airbus has a lot riding on the new Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engines, but so does United Technologies. Hopefully that will lead to a swift solution to the early production hiccups.

Boeing Joins Airbus to Start Selling to Iran - Financial Tribune,"Fri, 23 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jaWFsdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvZG9tZXN0aWMtZWNvbm9teS81MDMwNS9ib2Vpbmctam9pbnMtYWlyYnVzLXRvLXN0YXJ0LXNlbGxpbmctdG8taXJhbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing won US approval to sell its first jetliners to Iran in almost 40 years, paving the way for the biggest business transaction between the two nations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

The US Treasury Department granted licenses to Boeing and Airbus Group SE on Wednesday for the first of a flurry of aircraft orders that Iran is counting on to upgrade an aging fleet.

Airbus won approval to export the first 17 jets in a $27 billion transaction announced in January as economic sanctions were eased. Boeing is still finalizing terms to provide as many as 109 jets to Iran Air, the Chicago-based planemaker said in an e-mailed statement, Bloomberg reported.

“It removes some uncertainty,” Howard Rubel, an analyst at Jefferies, said of Boeing’s license. “It says that commerce is important and commerce builds bridges. It is also a pathfinder for other people that may want to do business with Iran over time.”

Boeing’s last airplane deliveries to Iran consisted of 747 jumbos that arrived in 1977, two years before the revolution, according to the company’s website. The Islamic Republic’s flag carrier would add more of the iconic, humpbacked 747s, as well as 777 and upgraded 777X wide-body jets under a $17.6 billion order for 80 Boeing aircraft. The US manufacturer is also helping Iran Air line up another 29 planes from leasing companies.

“Any final sales agreement would have to adhere to the license we’ve been issued,” Mark Sklar, a spokesman for Boeing, said by email.

Boeing rose on the news, advancing 2.2% to $130.56 at the close in New York, tied for the biggest gain on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

The company faces risks and uncertain rewards, as it vies with Airbus to replace Iran’s aging fleet. Congressional opponents have vowed to block the exports. Boeing may also need to leave wiggle room to back out of any potential orders if the next US president decides to reinstate sanctions.

With Boeing Deal, Americans Coming to Iran

Long before the first newly purchased Boeing airliner lands at Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport, Iran and the United States will have had to come to terms with a new reality: American citizens will once again be taking up residence in Tehran, the first to do so since the Islamic Revolution and subsequent hostage crisis in 1979 and 1980, wrote the New York Times.

When the United States on Wednesday gave the green light for the direct sale of western planes to Iran, much more than nearly four decades of sanctions on such deals came to an end. Not that the deals approved by the Treasury Department are insignificant: 80 Boeing jets and an initial batch of 17 Airbus planes out of a potential total of 118.

But the sale will have the important effect of ending an era of absolute isolation between the countries. Boeing will almost certainly have to open an administrative office in Tehran and technicians will have to move here to train their Iranian counterparts in the care and maintenance of the planes. Among them, almost certainly, will be many Americans.

That seems to be exactly what the United States had in mind in approving the deal, Iranian analysts say.

“Once this deal is a fact, it will be much harder for the hardliners to try to prevent relations with the United States,” said Farshad Qorbanpour, a political activist who supports Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani.

“Nobody can deny that with the planes, people and know-how will enter Iran.”

Word of the Boeing and Airbus deals came, as Rouhani was attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Speaking at a news conference on Thursday, the president said Iranian officials already had developed relationships with counterparts at both aviation companies through “many visits”, and that Iran welcomed foreign businesses and investments.

“I do not see any problems,” he told reporters. “It is the United States government that is responsible for keeping American companies from the Iranian market. If Americans have problems, they need to resolve their own problems.”

Buying planes from the United States, opening a Boeing office or having American representatives at an international airport might seem insignificant. But they represent a tectonic shift in relations.

In 1980, when ties between the countries were severed, all 140,000 Americans living in Iran were forced to leave. The United States Embassy was turned into an ideological museum and all American businesses left over the years, as sanctions made commerce increasingly difficult, and more recently, impossible.

The bureaus of The New York Times, Bloomberg and some other news media organizations were long the only official American entities allowed to operate in Iran, either by the Iranian authorities or under United States sanctions.

When Conoco won an oil contract in Iran in 1995, it secretly opened an office in Tehran, only to close it when Congress adopted tougher sanctions.

Many Iranians hope the January nuclear deal, which led to the lifting of some of those measures, changed all of that, citing the jetliner deal as the start of a new era. “We are getting to a point where the gap between economic relations and political normalization is gradually getting smaller,” said Saeed Laylaz, an Iranian economist close to the government.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996750354766846}",neutral,0.9996750354766846,0

Unveiled in May 2014, the enhancement grows MTOW by 300kg (661lb) to 7.8t and will not require any changes to the helicopter’s hardware, says the manufacturer, simply a modification of its Helionix avionics system and flight manual.

European Aviation Safety Agency certification is expected “before the end of the year”, says Airbus Helicopters, and the upgrade will be available to both new and in-service examples.

Also due for EASA approval this year is a limited ice protection system. Tests of the equipment ended in the early part of 2016 and the certification paperwork “is in the final stages of completion”, it says.

Lastly, flight trials with the manufacturer’s Rig ‘N’ Fly automated approach system are “almost completed”, says Airbus Helicopters, with no issues detected; it says the certification process “will be completed before summer 2017”.

Deliveries of the H175 have been sluggish thanks to the downturn in the oil and gas market. However, the first example to enter service in Latin America was recently handed over to Mexican operator Transportes Aereos Pegaso; a second H175 will follow in 2017.

The Unsung Hero Left Out of 'Sully' - The Daily Beast,"Sun, 18 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTYvMDkvMTgvdGhlLXVuc3VuZy1oZXJvLWxlZnQtb3V0LW9mLXN1bGx50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Fear of flying has no easy antidote. It’s no good telling sufferers that flying is so much safer than driving on the expressway to the airport. That’s statistics, not the reality of the human condition. But there is one feel-good story that may be invoked to calm the fever: the moment in January 2009 when 150 airline passengers suddenly found themselves heading not for their destination, Charlotte, North Carolina but the ice-cold Hudson River in New York.

This is, of course, the Miracle on the Hudson. US Airways Flight 1549 had lost power from both engines after the engines ingested a flight of Canadian geese soon after taking off from La Guardia Airport.

Few passengers ever bother to know or even care about the names of the pilots to whom they entrust their lives. In this case none of the passengers (and much of the nation) would ever forget the name of the pilot, Captain Chesley Sullenberger, or just Sully.

Now Sully has rightly been elevated into the pantheon of those American heroes worthy of being played by Tom Hanks. The Clint Eastwood directed movie, Sully, is a surprise box office hit. It seems a good moment, then, to finally give credit to a hero so far unsung in this drama.

To do justice to this hero it is necessary to get into the cockpit of Sully’s Airbus A320 with a more demanding eye than the movie has. It involves understanding what happens when an airplane is in its most perilous physical state, absolutely at the edge of its ability to keep flying. Bear with me. It’s worth the effort.

Sully didn’t do it alone, and he knew that he didn’t. There was another hand flying that Airbus to a heart-stopping splashdown. If you watch the movie carefully you can catch a fleeting glimpse of what I’m talking about.

In the final seconds before the airplane hits the water you’ll see Sully’s left hand (or rather Tom Hanks’s hand playing Sully’s gifted hand) on the sidestick controlling the airplane. He appears to be pulling hard back to keep the nose up.

In fact, Sully’s command was being overridden by the Airbus’s own brain. It reduced the nose-up angle by two-and-a-half degrees. Sully wasn’t pulling back too hard, he wanted all the angle he could get to soften the impact on the water. But he knew that the airplane itself was computing how to preserve control when at the limits of its ability to keep flying, and that it would know how to do that better than he did. This

turned out to be an extraordinary, exquisite moment when a machine and a man, together, got it exactly right.

Had the airplane had conventional controls with a yoke, or wheel, directly in front of the pilots – the classic “joystick” of aviation legend – the end of that flight might have been very different. But the Airbus has that sidestick, looking a lot like an old Atari control stick. And the sidestick is transmitting input from the pilot into the computers where it is governed by a system called envelope protection.

Put simply, the envelope is a kind of three-dimensional box in the sky inside which the airplane remains stable and under control and outside which it must not stray for fear of crashing.

When an airplane is on the margins, as Sully’s was, the greatest danger is an aerodynamic stall. If the airplane is flying too slowly and the nose is up, its wings will suddenly lose all lift – and the pilot loses all control over what it then does.

Sully’s own brain was processing his situation as acutely as the computer was, with the kind of instincts and acuity that only a pilot at the top of his game has. In the 300 or so seconds since the bird strike took out both of his engines Sully’s brain had made multiple calls and all of them were right (we’ll get to the two most important later).

The intervention of the computer to lower the nose meant that Sully had one less pressure on him when his hand on the sidestick was taking another action that made all the difference between surviving and disaster.

“He kept his wings almost perfectly level at touchdown” Robert Benzon, who led the National Transportation Safety Board’s investigation into the accident, told The Daily Beast. “A dipped wing would have turned the A320 into a water-borne Frisbee.”

Boeing has adopted most of the same cockpit automation as Airbus, but signally stopped short of abandoning the yoke and allowing the computers to override the pilot. In a Boeing cockpit there is no envelope protection. Instead the yoke begins shaking to warn the pilot if the airplane approaches stall. It remains central to Boeing philosophy about the relationship of pilot and machine that the pilot retains authority.

But, in case you’re wondering, neither Boeing nor Airbus will argue that their contrasting philosophies on the degree of latitude allowed a pilot in extremis is safer than the other.

It’s just not that simple.

In many ways cockpit automation has made flying much safer, but there is a problem. Most of the new generation of airline pilots have never had to revert to their own instincts and reflexes in a crisis in the way that Sully did. A spate of recent crashes has involved pilots getting into fatal aerodynamic stalls and not knowing how to get out of them. As a result, new enhanced flight simulators are coming into use specifically to train pilots for that event.

Those crashes have happened in both Airbus and Boeing airplanes. In an Airbus one factor has been what happens if the primary computers fail – for example, if there is a loss of electrical power. In that case the envelope protection system is also lost and pilots have to fly the airplane manually. It was assumed that they would be able to do this successfully when under stress and when facing other failures. That assumption has sometimes been misplaced. The new simulators will put all airline pilots through that stress and show them how to handle it. (Alaska Airlines pilots will be the first to use it.)

Sully’s own view of the Airbus system is pertinent. In the final one of three interviews that the NTSB conducted with him he was asked to compare the Boeing and Airbus systems. He said that the Airbus protection systems “went far beyond” the warnings of a “conventional” (i.e., Boeing) airplane.”

People who have seen the movie will no doubt be surprised to hear that interviews between Sully and his copilot Jeffrey Skiles and the NTSB were serious and civilized and devoted to learning the lessons of the experience – hopefully one that no pilot would in future be faced with. The NTSB wanted to make sure that if they were, they would be better prepared to handle it.

In the movie the NTSB investigators are cast as the villains – they convene what seems like a kangaroo court and, from the start, interrogate the pilots in a way that implies that by choosing to land on the Hudson Sully made the wrong call, that he could have made it back to where the flight began, La Guardia, or, alternatively, to nearby Teterboro in New Jersey. The screenwriter, Todd Komarnicki, told the BBC that the NTSB “spent nine months trying to pin this on him…they didn’t like that he was a hero.”

This is no small matter. We are not talking about arcane technical details best excised from film scripts. Reputations are involved.

The NTSB is a relatively small government agency with an annual budget of $105 million – it has a staff of 423 people of whom 130 are aviation safety investigators.

The NTSB’s chief of media relations, Christopher O’Neil, told the Daily Beast: “Using the NTSB’s investigation of the accident as the movie’s antagonist is unfortunate and belies the purpose of the investigation and the benefits of our comprehensive investigative process. Thirty-five safety recommendations were issued as a result of our investigation of the ditching of Flight 1549.

“The NTSB was not asked to contribute in the production of Sully and as such we were not afforded an opportunity to ensure our actions and words were portrayed with accurate context or reflected our perspective.”

When Benzon arrived in New York on the evening of January 15 to take charge of the investigation he was at the peak of a distinguished career. He was veteran of many investigations and, four years earlier, had been accorded the Chairman’s Award, the highest honor given to NTSB staff. One of the first things he did was to ask for a tally of survivors. He was incredulous that everyone had survived. After counts by the New York police and the New York fire department he asked for a third from the New York City Office of Emergency Management, all confirming that there were no casualties.

Benzon recognized that this was a unique situation in his experience. The pilots had a story to tell that would throw an invaluable light on the interaction of them and the Airbus automated cockpit. There was a captain with unusually deep experience combining old-school seat-of-the-pants skills with an understanding of a computerized flight management system.

Two days after the crash, Sully and Skiles had their first interviews with the investigating team. The movie shows them together at a table opposite the team but, in fact, they were interviewed individually and consecutively, normal procedure, Sully for two hours and 45 minutes and Skiles for two hours and 18 minutes. More than two months later, on March 27, they were both interviewed again, this time on the phone, Sully for an hour and 10 minutes and Skiles for an hour.

On June 15 – after he had appeared with Skiles at a public hearing – Sully was interviewed again, on the phone, for 31 minutes.

Transcripts of the interviews show that at no time was there anything resembling an inquisition of the pilots. Moreover, in Sully’s final interview in June the investigators were respectfully listening to Sully’s ideas for improving pilots’ understanding of the Airbus systems.

A key part of the movie’s dramatic tension is based on real-time reconstructions of the flight made on simulators at the Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France. These are set-up by the script as the NTSB’s “gotcha” moment. The simulator pilots appear to make successful landings at both LaGuardia and Teterboro – until 35 seconds is deducted from the time available to make the diversion, the actual time that elapsed between the bird strike and Sully’s assessment of his options. Then, with that adjustment, in the movie’s triumphal moment, all the simulated attempts to make it to a runway end in crashes.

In fact, the purpose of the simulations was not to try to demonstrate that Sully had made the wrong call but to see what resources the airplane had to remain flying without thrust and for how long. Fifteen runs were made in the simulator. Even before the 35-second delay was introduced it became obvious after several runs that diverting to either of the two airports was far too dangerous and further attempts were abandoned.

In reality the investigators understood from the start that Sully had made two calls that made the difference between a miracle and a disaster.

The first was how quickly he assessed his options, ruled out turning back to an airport and decided to fly over the George Washington Bridge and down into the Hudson, putting himself clear of the skyscrapers of Manhattan on his left and the cities of New Jersey on his right.

The second decision was just as critical and it was not on the checklist for an emergency like this one. Based just on instinct, Sully switched on the auxiliary power unit, a small turbine engine in the rear of the airplane that normally supplies power when the airplane is at the gate and the engines are shut down. Without the power generated by that unit there would not have been enough electrical power for the computers to provide the flight envelope protection. Sully would have lost the hidden hand that helped him save the airplane.

In Benzon’s words, “the airplane had the pilot’s back.”

The last 15 minutes of the movie are compelling. Eastwood gives a master class in the choreography of a multiple viewpoint spectacle. The digital rendering of the airplane, the crash and the rescue is chillingly visceral. Hanks, as usual, wholly becomes the part.

It’s a pity that the filmmakers felt that in order to pump up the drama they had to traduce people who are among the most dedicated public servants we have – the reason why flying is as safe as it is has a lot to do with the consummate forensic skills of NTSB investigators. Over the years they have steadily pinpointed and eliminated failures, both human and mechanical, and saved many lives.

Benzon fears that the movie will make that job harder.

“I do not know why the writer and director chose to twist the role of the NTSB into such an inaccurate depiction. Their treatment of the NTSB went very far beyond cinematic license into simple mean-spirited dishonesty. The movie may actually be detrimental to aviation safety. Pilots involved in accidents will now expect harsh, unfair treatment by investigators. They and others who see the movie will now believe that the NTSB enters into any investigation with preconceived notions, and that we are intent on destroying reputations. Simply untrue. The NTSB is the best friend an airline passenger never gets to meet.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9967401623725891}",neutral,0.9967401623725891,0

They will be the first wide body jets in the state-owned airline’s fleet.

“Saturday’s board has allowed the NAC (Nepal Airlines) management to begin the (A300-200) procurement process, and it is all prepared for it,” Buddhi Sagar Lamichhane, joint secretary of the Tourism Ministry, was quoted in the state’s national paper, The Kathmandu Post, this morning. “The (NAC) board was unanimous regarding the induction of the Airbus jets into the fleet.”

The first A330-200 will be inducted in September 2017, and the second will follow six months later. The ultimate goal for Nepal Airlines is to have an all-Airbus fleet. Having aircraft from the same family reduces maintenance and crew training costs.

Currently Nepal Airlines’ fleet is made up of two B757s, two A320s, one MA60, three Twin Otters and one Y12e. The older of its two Boeing 757, which was purchased 29 years ago, is being phased out.

Nepal Airlines connects Kathmandu, its base station, to eight international cities, including Bengaluru, Delhi and Mumbai.

"Many Safety Reforms Suggested After 'Miracle on Hudson' Rejected, Unresolved - Insurance Journal","Mon, 19 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc3VyYW5jZWpvdXJuYWwuY29tL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwvMjAxNi8wOS8xOS80MjY4MDguaHRt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In the seven years since an airline captain saved 155 lives by ditching his crippled airliner in the Hudson River, there’s been enough time to write a book and make a movie, but apparently not enough to carry out most of the safety recommendations stemming from the accident.

Of the 35 recommendations made by the National Transportation Safety Board in response to the incident involving US Airways Flight 1549, only six have been heeded, according to an Associated Press review of board records.

The movie “Sully,” which opened in theaters last week is based in part on an autobiography by veteran pilot Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger, played by Tom Hanks. It celebrates how Sullenberger, along with his co-pilot, flight attendants, air traffic controllers, ferry boat operators and first responders, did their jobs with professionalism and competence, averting a potential tragedy. The plane lost thrust in both engines after colliding with a flock of Canada geese shortly after takeoff from LaGuardia Airport in New York. No one died, and only five people were seriously injured.

“The FAA was very upset back then that we made any recommendations at all,” recalled Tom Haueter, who was the NTSB’s head of aviation safety at the time. “They thought this was a success story.”

But to investigators, the event turned up problems. “This could happen again and we want to make sure that if it does, there are some better safety measures in place,” Haueter said.

Fourteen of the recommendations issued to the Federal Aviation Administration and its European counterpart, EASA, are marked by the NTSB as “closed-unacceptable,” which means that regulators rejected the advice. One has been withdrawn, and the rest remain unresolved.

The untold story of the “Miracle on the Hudson” was the part luck played in preventing catastrophe on that freezing afternoon in January 2009. The wind chill was 2 degrees and the water temperature was 41 degrees, raising the risk of “cold shock,” a condition in which people lose the use of their arms and legs, usually drowning within 5 minutes.

It was sheer chance that the plane, an Airbus A320, was equipped with rafts, life vests and seat cushions that can be used for flotation. The equipment is only required on “extended overwater” flights, and not on Flight 1549’s New York to Charlotte, North Carolina, route.

The NTSB recommended requiring life vests and flotation cushions on all planes, regardless of the route. But the FAA responded that it was leaving that up to the airlines.

The board also recommended that vest storage be redesigned for easier retrieval. The NTSB’s investigation found that only 10 passengers retrieved life vests and not all of them put them on correctly. Despite some changes by the FAA, the board says it still takes more than a few seconds to retrieve vests, which is as much time as passengers are willing to take when exiting a plane filling with water.

Because Flight 1549’s descent was faster than the plane is designed to handle for a ditching, the underside of the aircraft was damaged when it hit the water. The two rear rafts were submerged and unusable. That left only the two forward rafts, which are designed to hold a maximum of 110 people _ well short of the 155 on board. Many of the passengers wound up standing on the wings as the plane gradually sank into the river.

The NTSB recommended changing the location of the rafts to ensure capacity for all passengers, since it’s unlikely the rear rafts would be available. The FAA rejected that, saying that if Sullenberger had followed Airbus’ directions on descent speeds for ditching, the rear rafts would have been usable. The NTSB said the ability of pilots to achieve those descent speeds has never been tested and can’t be relied on.

Some passengers wound up using the inflated exit ramps as rafts even though they’re not designed for that. But passengers weren’t able to release the ramps from the plane, running the risk that the ramps would be pulled underwater along with it. The NTSB recommended requiring quick-release attachments for ramps. The FAA rejected the advice, saying its analysis shows that the attachments were likely to be fully or partially underwater. NTSB said its investigation showed that wasn’t the case.

In the movie, immediately after Flight 1549’s engines quit, first officer Jeff Skiles, played by Aaron Eckhart, began going through a checklist of procedures for restarting the engines. Pilots are trained to do that in an emergency when they don’t know how to fix a problem, but Skiles was only able to get through a fraction of the checklist items before the plane landed in the river.

The NTSB’s investigation showed the procedures were designed for a dual-engine failure at a cruising altitude above 20,000 feet, high enough for pilots to complete the list while descending and still have time to regain altitude. But Flight 1549 collided with the geese at an altitude of only 2,818 feet. Among NTSB’s closed-unacceptable recommendations are that the FAA require airlines to include procedures for a low-altitude, dual-engine failure in checklists and pilot training.

(Source: Reuters)

Airbus Group said on Friday it would merge with its planemaking unit, strip out bureaucracy and simplify its brand, marking a break with its complex corporate roots as it prepares for tougher expected competition.

Europe’s largest aerospace group will be renamed “Airbus” after its core planemaking brand under the shake-up, the latest piece of corporate tinkering since it emerged from a cluster of French, German and Spanish aerospace interests in 2000.

Watch What Else Is Making News

Airbus confirmed the promotion of Fabrice Bregier to the new role of chief operating officer for the whole group, with overall responsibility for reshaping digital operations as well as for the global supply chain and quality.

He will continue to carry out his existing job in charge of the planemaking business, renamed Airbus Commercial Aircraft.

“We are bringing Team Airbus closer together, recognising that our commercial aircraft division is by far the largest contributor to our company’s revenues and financials,” Chief Executive Tom Enders said in a statement.

The company curbed the influence of French and German governments in 2013 and adopted its best-known jetmaking brand a year later by renaming itself Airbus Group, but left in place an overlapping structure and confusion over which Airbus was which.

People familiar with the plans said earlier that this distinction would now disappear as the vehicle for the original merger, known as Airbus Group SAS, and the planemaker, Airbus SAS, merge into a single company based in Toulouse under a sole chief executive, German-born Enders.

Both are currently subsidiaries of the listed entity, Airbus Group SE, which is based in the Netherlands.

Enders has promised to bring new digital thinking into production, development and support to speed decision-making and prepare for future competition across the group’s products which range from aircraft to satellites and defence systems.

He told staff in a letter last week the changes would result in consolidation and cost-reductions at the top of the company.

French labour unions ranging from Force Ouvriere to the CGT, CFDT and CFE-CGC said they feared possible job cuts.

Force Ouvriere said in a statement it would “watch all the components of this restructuring, notably its social impact”

CGT official Xavier Petrachi told Reuters: “We do not know yet the scope of this restructuring. Will it be limited to the support functions of Airbus Group and of Airbus SAS or will it impact the structures of Airbus Operations and entities of the helicopters and defence and space units ?”

The heads of the company’s two other divisions, helicopters boss Guillaume Faury and defence and space chief Dirk Hoke, are expected to assume additional group-wide roles to help drive through Enders’ so-called “digital transformation” project.

The company said these units would benefit from reduced costs due to the internal merger, which will take effect in January. It did not provide any financial details.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999499320983887}",neutral,0.9999499320983887,0
Airbus Defence and Space and P&WC mark delivery of 400th PW127G engine - Skies Magazine,"Fri, 09 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vc2tpZXNtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1cy1kZWZlbmNlLXNwYWNlLXB3Yy1tYXJrLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LTQwMHRoLXB3MTI3Zy1lbmdpbmUv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly9za2llc21hZy5jb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvYWlyYnVzLWRlZmVuY2Utc3BhY2UtcHdjLW1hcmstZGVsaXZlcnktNDAwdGgtcHcxMjdnLWVuZ2luZS8_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Defence and Space Press Release | September 9, 2016

Estimated reading time 3 minutes, 31 seconds.

Pratt and Whitney Canada (P&WC) has delivered the 400th PW127G turboprop engine for the C295W aircraft produced by Airbus Defence and Space.

The engine is assembled at P&WC’s Longueuil, Que. facility and is the exclusive powerplant for the market-leading Airbus C295W maritime patrol and medium transport aircraft being offered for Canada´s Fixed-Wing Search and Rescue (FWSAR) program.

A total of 168 C295 aircraft have been sold to 23 different countries and the global fleet has logged more than 275,000 flight hours.

“Pratt & Whitney Canada has played a key role over many years in securing and maintaining the C295’s dominant market position,” said Antonio Barberan, senior vice-president, Airbus Defence and Space. “Every C295W is powered by engines that were assembled in Quebec. That means that today, the fruits of Canadian skills and expertise are working in the toughest and most remote conditions imaginable, be it the Arctic, deserts, mountains, or in storms far out at sea.

“Each engine we buy is the product of highly skilled jobs in Canada, representing the export of Canadian skills and expertise to the rest of the world.”

The C295W boasts further Canadian content beyond its engines with simulators by CAE and electro/optical sensors by L-3 Wescam. All told, about 20 per cent of the C295W is Canadian content.

Additionally, and if successful with Canada’s FWSAR program, Newfoundland-based Provincial Aerospace will provide in-service support for the C295W fleet through the AirPro partnership with Airbus Defence and Space, increasing Canadian participation significantly further.

The relationship between P&WC, Airbus Defence and Space, and its Airbus Group sister companies extends well beyond the C295W aircraft. P&WC produces auxiliary power units (APUs) for the A380 and A320 series of commercial jet liners, and PW206-B engines power the Airbus Helicopters H135 twin-engine helicopter.

The PT6C-67E engine is used with Airbus Helicopters H175 and the PW100 engines powering the ATR42/72 regional turboprop aircraft have been procured through Airbus sourcing.

“We value our business relationship with the Airbus companies and we are proud of our reliable and dependable PW127G engine, which has powered Airbus C295 aircraft for almost 20 years,” said Maria Della Posta, senior vice-president, P&WC. “We are delighted to join them in marking this important milestone.”

“Airbus Defence and Space is committed to building long-lasting, export-oriented relationships with supplier partners. We believe we work with the best suppliers in the world, enabling us to build exceptional products,” said Barberan. “We certainly consider that Canadian, and particularly Quebec companies like P&WC, are part of that equation. We look forward to continuing this relationship in the future, and especially to ensuring that P&WC’s skills and expertise become an integral part of Canada’s next FWSAR aircraft.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.982003390789032}",neutral,0.982003390789032,0

Highlighting its wide range of products, the company will present the H225M Caracal, which landed yesterday in Kielce following a ferry flight from France, together with the Tiger HAD and H145M on its static display.

Airbus Helicopters’ presence at the show is in line with Airbus Group’s “Make in Poland” ambition and will aim to emphasize its global commitment of long-term cooperation in country.

The H225M Caracal, pre-selected by the Polish government in 2015, is a heavy, modern and combat-proven platform able to perform the widest range of missions from special operations to combat search-and-rescue, tactical transport, medical evacuation as well as a large spectrum of maritime missions. Operated by the armed forces of France, Brazil, Mexico, Malaysia and Thailand, the H225M Caracal has demonstrated its reliability even in the harshest operational environments.

Kuwait is the latest nation to join the community of Caracal users with an order of 30 H225M Caracal helicopters placed by the State of Kuwait last month.

Alongside the H225M will be Airbus Helicopters’ multi-role attack helicopter, the Tiger HAD, offered to Poland in the frame of its upcoming “Kruk” acquisition project. The Tiger is designed to perform armed reconnaissance, air or ground escort, air-to-air combat, ground firing support, destruction and anti-tank warfare, day or night and in adverse conditions. It has proven its capabilities during operational deployments in Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, Libya and Mali.

For the first time this year at MSPO, a real H145M from the German armed forces will be exhibited in Kielce. Certified in 2015, the H145M is the latest member of the Airbus Helicopters four-ton-class twin-engine rotorcraft product range — with built-in mission capability and flexibility, especially in high-and-hot operating conditions. In its military version, this economical and versatile helicopter covers the entire spectrum of military missions, from light utility to light attack.

Besides Airbus’ strong helicopters appearance, the company’s stand at MSPO will also see a variety of first class products from its defense and space division, Europe’s largest defense and space enterprise and the second largest space business worldwide.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9961192607879639}",neutral,0.9961192607879639,0

Vietnam’s Vietjet has placed a firm order with Airbus for 20 A321 single aisle aircraft to meet growth on its domestic and regional network. The purchase agreement, covering 10 A321ceo and 10 A321neo, was signed in Hanoi today by Vietjet President and CEO, Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao and Fabrice Brégier, Airbus President & CEO.

The signing took place during the state visit to Vietnam of François Hollande, President of France, and was witnessed by Mr Hollande and Tran Dai Quang, President of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.

In addition to the new order, Vietjet and Airbus also finalised an agreement for the manufacturer to provide training services for flight crew and maintenance personnel at the airline’s new facility in Ho Chi Minh City. This will see Airbus oversee courses at the facility identical to those offered at the manufacturer’s own training centres.

At the signing ceremony, the President and CEO of Vietjet Nguy?n Th? Ph??ng Th?o ?shared: “Vietjet is developing robustly and sustainably with an aim at better serving our passengers and promoting tourism and economic development in Vietnam and other regional countries.The friendly relationship in politics and culture between Vietnam and France has been nurtured through generations. Two countries are heading towards a more efficiently economic cooperation of which today agreement of Vietjet and Airbus is a vivid example. We do take pride in and appreciate Airbus for their efforts and supports since our operation. Thanks to our modern fleet with advanced designs, fuel efficiency as well as effective supports in operations, training and system development, Vietjet will continue to realize passengers’ dreams of flying, to create a future in the air with an aim at making Vietjet become more and more popular globally.”

“We are pleased to sign our latest purchase agreement with Vietjet,” said Fabrice Brégier, Airbus President & CEO. “Vietjet is benefitting from the very significant economies that come from operating a single aircraft family. For busier routes the A321 combines higher capacity with the lowest operating costs in its class, offering unbeatable efficiency. We look forward to developing further our partnership with Vietjet, including working with the airline to develop its new training facility.”

Vietjet first took to the skies at the end of 2011 and now operates a fleet of 40 A320 Family aircraft. Following today’s announcement the airline has placed firm orders with Airbus for a total of 119 A320 Family aircraft, including 54 A320s and 65 A321s.

The A320 Family is the world’s best-selling single aisle product line, with four models (A318, A319, A320, A321) ranging from 100 to 240 seats. To date, the Family has won more than 12,700 orders since launch and more than 7,150 aircraft have been delivered to some 400 customers and operators worldwide.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9465774297714233}",positive,0.9465774297714233,1

Question: My friend, an airline captain, tells me that the bigger the plane, the more backup systems on the aircraft. Is it safe to say then that the A380s, 747s and 777s are safer to fly?

— Submitted by reader Gabriel, Penang, Malaysia

Answer: The A380, 747 and 777 are certainly safe. So are other airliners like the Airbus A320 family, the Boeing 737 family, 757, 767, A330/340, A350, 787, Embraer 135/145, EMB 170/190 and Bombardier CRJs, to list a few. Airliners are safe.

The larger airplanes have a larger number of redundant systems due to their size but that, by itself, does not mean one airplane is safer than another.

Q: Is it safer to be on a smaller plane or larger one?

— Natasha, District of Columbia

A: It is not possible to make a safety differentiation between small or large airplanes because the terms are vague.

Regional airline-size airplanes have a somewhat higher accident rate than do larger airline jets.

Turboprops have a higher accident rate than jets.

Airline jets have some models having lower accident rates than others, but size is not the determining factor.

Aviation is the safest form of transportation (after a previous column, I was corrected that an escalator is safer, but I don’t think it’s quite comparable). This makes it very hard to say that one airplane is significantly safer than another. They are both safe — even if one type has a slightly higher accident rate, that rate is still infinitesimal.

Q: Is a four-engine 747 safer than a two-engine 777?

— Submitted via email

A: No, they are both safe. Having two additional engines is not a guarantee of increased safety. The engine failure rate of the B747 is higher, due to having two more engines and the older technology.

Q: Does having only two engines increase risk when flying over oceans?

— Keck, Los Angeles

A: No, the reliability of modern jet engines is so good that flying over oceans or remote locations is not risky. One consideration is that having more engines increases the possibility of one of them having a problem. The regulatory authorities have very strict standards for twin-engine overwater operations.

I fly over oceans in twin-engine airplanes many times each year with no concern about the risk of engine failure.

Boeing's smallest jet to fly trans-Atlantic routes - The Globe and Mail,"Thu, 15 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVnbG9iZWFuZG1haWwuY29tL3JlcG9ydC1vbi1idXNpbmVzcy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLWJ1c2luZXNzL3VzLWJ1c2luZXNzL2JvZWluZ3Mtc21hbGxlc3QtamV0LXRvLWZseS10cmFucy1hdGxhbnRpYy1yb3V0ZXMvYXJ0aWNsZTMxOTA4MDMwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With the re-engined Boeing 737 MAX, above, and A320neo jets, people can look forward to competitive fares as carriers seek out smaller airports with lower access charges.David Ryder/Bloomberg Share

The smallest aircraft made by Boeing Co. and Airbus Group SE are about to find a new role operating trans-Atlantic routes that were previously the preserve of some of the world's biggest planes.

The re-engined 737 Max and A320neo jets offer a 15-per-cent fuel saving meant to cut costs on the shortest inter-city services. At the same time, the revamp has added about 804 kilometres to their range – just enough to allow the narrow-bodies to span the 4,828 kilometres between the eastern U.S. and Western Europe.

While eight hours on a 130-foot plane with three toilets and one gangway might not immediately appeal to travellers used to the spacious cabins of an Airbus A380, airlines say the smaller jets will open up direct routes that wouldn't otherwise be viable. That would do away with the need to switch between flights at a busy hub. At the same time, people can look forward to competitive fares as carriers seek out smaller airports where access charges are lower.

Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, JetBlue Airways Corp. and Portugal's TAP are among airlines buying the jets for trans-Atlantic routes, with NAS set to lead the way when it becomes one of the first carriers to get Boeing's Max 8 next year. Its initial flights may link Edinburgh, Birmingham in England and Cork and Shannon in Ireland to smaller airports in New England and the New York area.

""The Max is very competitive,"" Norwegian Air Chief Executive Officer Bjorn Kjos said in an interview in London. ""It has huge potential from the smaller cities along the Atlantic coast. But you can't go into New York as you do with wide-bodies. You must target airports with a totally different cost structure.""

Boeing's 757, the world's longest single-aisle airliner with around 200 seats and a range in excess of 4,000 miles, has been plying the Atlantic for years, with companies including United Continental Holdings Inc. still deploying the model on routes such as Newark, New Jersey, to Birmingham, England. Production ceased in 2004, however, leaving those 757s still flying in the twilight of their lives and with fuel consumption way in excess of modern jets.

The 737 and A320, by contrast, were designed for much shorter flights, with the original 737-100 seating just 85 people and limited to trips of about 1,200 miles. While ranges have increased, the 5,310-kilometre reach of the 737-800 and –900 is insufficient for fully laden operations on trans-Atlantic routes where jets must carry enough reserve fuel to fly about 804 kilometres in an emergency. A handful of carriers operate services at reduced capacity, which cuts the weight of a plane and increases its range, with SAS AB serving Boston from Copenhagen using an 86-seat 737-700 and British Airways connecting London City airport and New York with an Airbus A318 carrying just 32 passengers.

The only current trans-Atlantic 737 or A320 services with a near-normal load are flown by Canada's WestJet Airlines Ltd. and link St. John's, Nfld., with Dublin – distance 3,218 kilometres – and Halifax, N.S., with Glasgow in Scotland. The 737-700s used have 136 seats.

The U.K. and Irish routes planned for Norwegian's 189-seat Max 8s will span about 4,828 kilometres. Subsequent flights could serve Stavanger, Trondheim and Bergen in Norway and Aalborg in Denmark, though they'll likely involve a long-range version of Airbus's A321neo known as the LR and able to fly more than 6,437 kilometres using extra fuel tanks, spokesman Lasse Sandaker-Nielsen said. Norwegian ordered 30 of the planes with 220 seats in a single class in July.

JetBlue and TAP also plan to deploy the model, which is set to be available from 2019. The U.S. carrier has agreed to buy 30 A321neos with an option to take some as LR variants, saying it wants an aircraft with ""trans-Atlantic range."" TAP has orders for 10 A321neoLRs, saying it could use them to serve Brazil and possibly the United States. Its Lisbon base is about 5,632 kilometres from both New York and Recife, the South American country's sixth-largest city. Ireland's Aer Lingus is also a likely operator of the A321neoLR across the Atlantic, Willie Walsh, CEO of parent company IAG SA, said in July, adding that the jet represents a ""fantastic opportunity."" It already flies 757s to locations including Hartford, Conn., typical of the cities smaller planes could serve.

With the LR emerging as a favoured successor to the 757, Boeing is studying designs for a stretch of its biggest Max 9 – dubbed the Max 10 – that would offer much of the range and payload of the A321 and could be ready by the decade's end, or a more elaborate revamp using the larger engines developed for the Airbus jet. It's also working on a new family of mid-range aircraft that would debut about five years later, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said Wednesday.

Whatever the outcome, passengers seem certain to be making longer trips on the smallest class of jetliners in coming years.

""For the moment we haven't really got the planes out there,"" said Yan Derocles, an analyst at Oddo Securites in Paris. ""But they're coming.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999487400054932}",neutral,0.9999487400054932,0

Vietnam Airlines currently operate a fleet of 4 Airbus A350-900 aircraft currently, with a further 10 to arrive. Should the Memorandum of Understanding turn into an order, this will bring Vietnam Airlines A350-900 fleet to 24 frames.

The airline was the second operator of the Airbus A350-900, and it seems that the aircraft has left a positive impression on the owners – so much so to order some more frames.

Vietnam Airlines plan to use the aircraft to operate non-stop services to the US West Coast, carrying 305 passengers in a three class premium layout.

Duong Tri Thanh, President and CEO of Vietnam Airlines states:

“The intention to acquire these additional aircraft reflects our excellent experience with the A350 since it entered service with Vietnam Airlines last year” “With its very long range capability, economic fuel consumption and spacious cabin, the A350 is the suitable aircraft for our proposed intercontinental routes to Europe and the US. The start of non-stop transpacific services with the A350 is yet another example of the commitment we have at Vietnam Airlines to strengthen our position as one of the world’s leading international carriers”

No time table of entry into service has been given for these new planes. Hopefully the new planes will join the fleet in the near future.

Weight watchers - DEVELOP3D - Develop3D,"Wed, 14 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vZGV2ZWxvcDNkLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0LWRlc2lnbi93ZWlnaHQtd2F0Y2hlcnMtbGlnaHQtcmlkZXItM2QtcHJpbnRpbmctdG9wb2xvZ3ktb3B0aW1pc2F0aW9uLWRlc2lnbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Looking more like an organic exoskeleton than motorcycle, the Light Rider weighs in at just 35kg

In the aircraft industry weight saving is king. Less mass to lift into the air means less fuel, which means less cost and carbon emissions. So it benefits the airline, the passenger and the planet.

Being one of the biggest aircraft manufacturers, Airbus knows this all too well. And although it still largely utilises traditional manufacturing methods, substantial resources have been dedicated towards advanced manufacturing technologies including additive layer manufacturing (ALM).

Here components are optimised during the design process to achieve less material waste and improved weight savings.

The advantages of such 3D printed parts for the aircraft industry are obvious – and Airbus is currently testing such parts on its aircraft (see box out below) – but many other industries from robotics to automotive and medical can also benefit.

So in 2013, Airbus set up APWorks, a 100% subsidiary with a production facility in Munich, to not only further explore this technology and work on innovative projects for Airbus Group, but to operate as an independent company offering expertise in design, materials and 3D printing.

“The perfect interplay of design, material and printing does not only lead to reduced weight, cost savings and the integration of increased functionality into parts, it also revolutionises the design and manufacturing process,” says Angela Gruenewald, APWorks marketing manager.

APWorks’ proprietary material Scalmalloy is a second generation aluminiummagnesium-scandium alloy developed for very high strength extrusions

However, with customer projects often being confidential, APWorks can’t tangibly showcase the possibilities of parts that have been designed specifically for ALM. So it hatched an idea for an internal project that would allow it to do just that. The product decided upon was an electric motorcycle.

“We decided on a product that people would already have a stereotype in mind of how it may look. They know what to expect of a bike and how heavy it is. But when they see our design, they’ll wonder how it is possible to design and produce such a thing,” says Gruenewald.

So having produced what APWorks claims to be the first 3D printed motorcycle, the rather aptly named Light Rider weighs in at just 35kg, of which the frame is a mere 6kg. And although it may be 30 per cent lighter than a motorcycle with a traditionally manufactured frame, it’s just as strong or possibly more so although may not look it.

Advanced materials

This project also provided APWorks with the opportunity to showcase its own proprietary material – Scalmalloy – in the construction of the frame.

Specifically developed for series production using ALM technologies, this aluminium alloy features mechanical properties that make it ideal for use in lightweight robotics, automotive and aerospace applications.

In the additive layer manufacturing process, a laser melts powdered Scalmalloy into thousands of layers

“To make radical progress in lightness, strength and ductility, we need advanced materials which will achieve their full potential when combined with advanced manufacturing. This is what we can do with Scalmalloy and for the Light Rider it means a frame of unprecedented weight saving,” continues Gruenewald.

The Light Rider project also provided the opportunity for APWorks to reveal how it goes about designing parts specifically for the ALM process. And to do this its engineers use a simulation tool from Altair called OptiStruct during the concept phase of the development process in an approach known as topology optimisation.

Essentially this is the ability to optimise material layout within a given design space, for a given set of loads and boundary conditions in order to achieve the required performance targets.

The first stage of the topology optimisation process using Altair’s OptiStruct is to defi ne the design space

As Mirko Bromberger, Altair’s director of marketing and additive manufacturing strategy, explains, “This branch of computer aided engineering (CAE) involves the use of intelligent technologies that give a designer guidance on where material is required and where it can be removed to leave a structure that exhibits the required performance targets but at a signifi cantly lower weight than relying on intuition or experience alone.”

The resulting optimisation

“The downside is that the organic shapes that the process creates have not traditionally been easy to manufacture, causing engineers to add mass back into the design to meet the practicalities of the production process. However, when optimisation techniques are coupled with additive manufacturing, it is possible to produce a structure that’s far closer to the optimum solution,” continues Bromberger.

The design engineers will then use these results to refine the design

Simulation driven design

In this simulation driven design process, APWorks’ engineers needed to firstly define the design space.

This refers to those areas where geometry cannot be adjusted such as fixing points or access holes. Then all known loads and boundary conditions were added.

APWorks used a Cafe Style Racer as the design guideline and researched information on typical load cases for motorcycles.

“Into OptiStruct we added some boundary conditions. We thought about all kinds of things – what’s located where on a bike, how big it is, what’s the wheel base, what happens when you ride it,” describes Gruenewald.

Additionally, as this was designed specifi cally for the ALM process, the engineers could create a hollow frame to not only further reduce mass but also provide a means of hiding cables and pipes. However, APWorks points out that the thin and complex structure achieved is only possible with very strong and lightweight materials like Scalmalloy.

“With Scalmalloy you can have lower wall thickness but still have the same strength if you compare it to other materials used for metallic 3D printing,” adds Gruenewald.

Having inputted all this information into OptiStruct, APWorks could then programme the algorithm to use bionic structures and natural growth processes as the basis for developing the frame. The software calculates the optimal load curve and where material has to be placed in order to meet the required stiffness characteristics. And as it starts to take shape in the software, the design looks more like an organic exoskeleton than motorcycle frame.

“But you just get a proposal from the software and the next step is that our design engineers interpret these optimisation results. For instance, they have to refine it further in order to get a printable and appealing geometry,” says Gruenewald.

The resulting design is again validated via an additional finite element analysis to confirm the required stiffness.

This is carried out using Altair’s HyperView tool.

Challenges ahead

However, a challenge during the design process was considering how to divide the frame up for printing as it couldn’t be printed as one complete structure. The engineers decided to create 14 separate sections that would be able to withstand all the loads.

The engineers also had to consider how the various parts would be assembled once printed. “With customer projects we know all these boundary conditions – we know where the part will be mounted at which point and what diameter the screws are or how it will be assembled to other parts. But for our motorcycle, it was really challenging to design everything that you can assemble afterwards and not encounter any problems with screws, cable or routing,” describes Gruenewald.

Happy with the final design, it was ready to send the files to the EOS selective 3D laser printing system, which uses a laser to melt powdered Scalmalloy into thousands of layers, with each layer being just 60 microns thick.

Once all the parts had emerged from the printer, they were TIG (tungsten inert gas) welded together, a process that uses a tungsten electrode to produce the weld and favoured in this project due to the greater control it offers the operator over the weld.

According to Gruenewald, it took three weeks to print and assemble the Light Rider. Once complete, it was ready to ride and with a 6kW electric motor can reach 80km/h in a few seconds.

“Those who have seen it are impressed by the design because it is new and innovative. And they are even more impressed when they can easily lift it up. But the real excitement comes when they ride it and feel the speed and strength of the motorcycle.

“They may have a feeling that there is material missing but in the end it is optimised for the loads so it’s just a new way of designing things,” she says.

APWorks is capable of creating series production at its facilities and so is currently offering a production run of 50 Light Riders for sale at €50,000.

The Light Rider has a 6kW electric motor powering it from 0 to 80km/h in just seconds

More to come

Although Light Rider may be an ostentatious display of what is possible with topology optimisation software, lightweight materials and 3D printing, APWorks has worked on some equally interesting but perhaps less glamorous projects including a bionic aircraft cabin partition (see box out below) and is also currently developing the first fully 3D printed liquid-to-liquid heat exchanger that can be used for both robotic and automotive applications.

But according to Gruenewald, the opportunities for optimised 3D printed parts are endless for any industry.

“It’s exciting for designers because they can completely rethink how they design products,” she says.

“Right now they have all these limitations in mind dictated by what is possible in manufacture, but with 3D printing they can design freely and can completely rethink this process. It is certainly exciting.”

APWorks technical manager Daniel Schneider will be talking at the SolidThinking Converge 2016 conference in Essen, Germany, on 20th – 21st September. The Light Rider will also be on display during this event.

He’ll then be talking again at the TCT Show + Personalize at the NEC in Birmingham on 29th September.

Taking flight with 3D printed parts

Together with Airbus, APWorks has developed what it refers to as the world’s largest metal 3D printed airplane component — the Bionic Partition.

This partition panel is essentially the wall that divides the aircraft cabin and supports the jump seats that the flight attendants sit on during takeoff and landing.

The current design, which has been flying in the A320 successfully for decades, is a strong and lightweight component made from a honeycomb composite but Airbus wanted to explore what could be possible using topology optimisation and additive manufacturing technology.

“An algorithm that uses the ‘biological algorithm’ of slime mould was developed to link critical connection points in an airplane partition. Then a process of bio computation was run that generates, evaluates, and evolves tens of thousands of design options,” explains Angela Gruenewald, APWorks marketing manager.

Collaborating with Autodesk, Airbus utilised its cloud computing service to generate all these design alternatives.

The component also marks the first time that APWorks’ proprietary material Scalmalloy has been used on large scale inside an aircraft component.

The new partition features far less material than its predecessor and also weighs 25kg less.

Airbus estimates that just this component will save 465,000 metric tonnes of CO2 per year.

The Bionic Partition is currently undergoing 16G crash testing as part of the process for certification and integration into the current fleet of A320 planes.

Airbus opens acoustic lab to study noise reduction - Eureka,"Fri, 23 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmVrYW1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvLnVrL2NvbnRlbnQvbmV3cy9haXJidXMtb3BlbnMtYWNvdXN0aWMtbGFiLXRvLXN0dWR5LW5vaXNlLXJlZHVjdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has opened an acoustic lab in Hamburg, Germany that for the first time allows it to investigate cabin noise and vibrations using a representative fuselage segment that approximates an A320-sized aircraft. Before the test platform at the Centre for Applied Aviation Research (ZAL), noise testing was previously evaluated by studying isolated components or during test flights.

“Noise is a highly sensitive topic,” explained Henning Scheel, co-leader of research at the acoustic lab. “Some noises are easy to ignore, even at high volumes. Others are deeply annoying.”

The ZAL’s 8.5-metre-long fuselage demonstrator can be subjected to sound waves around its full circumference via a system of 128 individually controllable speakers. This setup was designed to replicate engine noise from existing and future propulsion concepts.

“The acoustic lab accurately reproduces conditions that apply in flight,” Scheel said. “This allows us to examine new noise reduction measures in the cabin, rendering expensive test flights unnecessary. The acoustic chamber also offers us the opportunity to perform detailed comparisons between simulation models and real-world physics.”

With the expertise gained at the ZAL acoustic lab, Airbus’ interior noise teams are pinpointing where noise enters the cabin and how it is spread and transmitted. They then can explore how background noise can be reduced – for example, by making minor structural modifications, using different types of insulation, or applying new materials such as embedded vibration dampers that absorb noise in a specific frequency range.

“We will significantly shorten the development cycle for new solutions with the help of this demonstrator,” added Martin Wandel, who co-leads the research with Scheel.

The ZAL chamber can accommodate fuselage demonstrators of up to 8m high and 15m long, including for Airbus’ A350 XWB and A330 widebody aeroplanes. The initial fuselage mock-up will be thoroughly investigated before work begins on representative cabin interior components. Tests with passengers are also planned for the future.

The acoustic lab is part of a newly-created infrastructure at the ZAL, which opened earlier this year as the technological research and development network for the Hamburg metropolitan region’s civil aviation industry. The ZAL functions as an interface between the aviation sector, academic and research institutions, and the City of Hamburg – with Airbus Operations being one of the three largest shareholders.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999895095825195}",neutral,0.9999895095825195,0
