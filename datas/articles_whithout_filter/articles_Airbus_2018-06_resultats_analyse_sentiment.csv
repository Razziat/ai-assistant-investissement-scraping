Reactions After My First Airbus A350 Flight - Airline Reporter,"Wed, 20 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxOC8wNi9yZWFjdGlvbnMtYWZ0ZXItbXktZmlyc3QtYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtZmxpZ2h0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It’s not every day that you get to fly an aircraft model for the first time. But at long last, after my fair share of missed attempts, I finally got a chance to fly an Airbus A350. I’m a bit ashamed I hadn’t flown it sooner. Being based in San Francisco, it’s been easier to fly the A350’s contemporary — Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner — courtesy of United and its star alliance partners ANA and Air Canada. I was excited to see firsthand how the A350 would compare, and it definitely did not disappoint.

Read on for this AvGeek’s take on the joys of flying Airbus’ A350, and thoughts on how it stacks up against my time flying the 787. Some of the differences are a matter of math, some are slightly more subjective. And yes, we’ll even talk about the most contentious topic of all — window shades versus window dimmers!

Just remember. I’m no airline industry insider. I’m not claiming to be an expert. These are just some subjective reflections and musings. I doubt everyone will agree with me on most points. Actually I hope you don’t. Remember, there’s a comments section at the bottom of this story. Show it some love!

Xtra Wide Body indeed

Before I had ass-in-seat experience with the A350, the “XWB” branding (for “Xtra Wide Body”) struck me as a touch cheesy. I mean, would the extra bit of width make more of a difference than all of the other cutting-edge features that make the A350 unique? Turns out, it sure does.

A lot of people focus on the 18-inch seat width standard in economy with the nine-abreast A350 configuration, which makes sense since elsewhere economy class seats keep getting narrower. On my Hong Kong Airlines flight I was fortunate to be flying up front, but I ducked back to look at economy. I’m a skinny guy so I can tolerate the narrow Dreamliner seats OK, but I could definitely appreciate the extra elbow room, which would be especially welcome on the long-haul routes the plane is designed to fly. An underrated bonus is that the A350’s cabin sidewalls were designed to be more vertical so that they don’t encroach as much on window seat passengers’ personal space.

I wasn’t expecting the extra fuselage width to make as much of a difference in business class. But that’s where I was wrong. Hong Kong Airlines flies a version of the forward-facing fully-flat staggered business class seat that can be found on airlines like Iberia and Asiana. But compared with those airlines, Hong Kong Airlines’ seat offered pads beside window seats that turned the already wide seat into an incredibly wide bed — the widest I’ve ever slept on.

So whether you’re sitting up front or in economy, the “XWB” factor makes a difference. Unless you’re flying the very few A350s delivered with a terrifyingly narrow ten-abreast seating layout. In which case, godspeed brave traveler.

Setting a higher bar for cabin ceilings

From the moment I walked onboard I was struck by how roomy the cabin A350 felt. The cabin ceiling is one of the highest out there. The picture below is with the overhead bins open. The cabin feels even more airy when they’re closed.

The design wizards at Airbus designed ENORMOUS overhead bins that don’t intrude much into the cabin space when stowed. The ambient ceiling lighting is an added bonus, though not one that’s unique to the A350.

No claustrophobia aboard this bird!

I think the A350 has a spirit animal?

I don’t mean it as a knock against the plane at all. Raccoons are adorable. Unless they’re toppling over your garbage cans in the middle of the night. Luckily A350s don’t do that.

It’s a damn good looking plane

Animal doppelgangers aside, while I personally don’t find the A350’s appearance quite as inspiring as the Dreamliner’s, it’s still gorgeous. In particular, the blended winglets are a thing of beauty.

I don’t feel like images on blogs and websites do them justice. They end up looking more like normal winglets in 2D. But getting to appreciate the dimensionality of the gracefully curved ribbon-like wingtips with your own two eyes is something else entirely.

OK, let’s talk windows

There are entire corners of the aviation blogosphere devoted to the mixed opinions about the 787’s windows. A lot of people seem to prefer the A350’s more traditional slide-down window shades. And to be fair, the A350’s windows offer excellent views and are much bigger than average.

Personally, I still prefer the Dreamliner’s windows. Although the A350’s windows are undeniably large, they’re still significantly smaller than the 787’s. The 787 windows are so tall and large that you sometimes get a solid view looking across the cabin through the windows on the far side of the plane, which really lets you feel the planes speed and size.

By comparison, the A350’s windows are smaller. They benefit from a larger inner windowpane that makes the window seem bigger than it is, but the wide space between the two panes can make it harder to take glare-free aerial photos.

What about the dimmers? I can see why some people aren’t fans of the 787’s dimmable tinted windows. But I personally far prefer the Dreamliner dimmers to standard window shades. I dread the moment when flight crews ask everyone to close their windows so that people can get rest. On daytime flights, having to shut out the sun completely hurts my ability to adapt to a new time zone. Also, no more views! On a 787, I can dim the windows to the next-to-lowest setting, which allows me to enjoy cruise flight with at least some view of the sun and scenery, without flooding the cabin with unwelcome sunlight.

External camera views for the AvGeeks

As with other A350 operators, Hong Kong Airlines offers passengers two external camera views through the inflight entertainment system. One looks down on the plane from the tail, and one looks forward and below from just behind the nose gear. The resolution is surprisingly good, even when displayed on a large screen. It easily beats endlessly rewatching movies or TV shows. Don’t just take my word for it — here’s some examples from my flight:

As for the other A350 bells and whistles, your mileage may vary

The A350 passenger experience features that impressed me most weren’t the ones I expected to. To be honest, the increased cabin humidity is probably good for me, but its not something that makes me feel much better in the moment. The plane offers advanced turbulence-dampening features, but you’re still going to feel the chop if you hit it.

On the other hand, I was definitely impressed with how quiet the A350 is. Even on takeoff, it’s more of a throaty hum than a deafening roar.

Airlines are really proud of their A350s

Last but not least, it’s great to see how proud Hong Kong Airlines and most other A350 operators are about showcasing the aircraft. When you board a HX A350, images of the aircraft are plastered on every inflight entertainment screen. And given all the passenger experience benefits I covered earlier, you can’t blame ’em.

The A350 vs the 787 vs the rest of the pack

Based on my first A350 trip, I’d say the plane makes good on its promise to improve the overall passenger experience. I’d lean heavily towards the A350 over the 787 if I was flying in economy, given the extra seat width, airier cabin, and incredible luggage storage capacity. But flying in premium economy or business, I think it’s more of a toss-up. My bigger takeaway is that I’d leap at any chance to fly either the A350 or 787 instead of any other aircraft model, except perhaps for the A380 or a 747-8.

"Airbus Tells Britain It Wants Details of a Brexit Deal, or Else (Published 2018) - The New York Times","Fri, 22 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTgvMDYvMjIvYnVzaW5lc3MvYWlyYnVzLWJyZXhpdC11ay1ldXJvcGVhbi11bmlvbi5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON — Britain voted almost exactly two years ago to leave the European Union, and months before it must agree on a withdrawal deal or crash out of the bloc, much remains undecided. Too much, for at least one company.

On Friday, the European aerospace giant Airbus, which makes commercial airliners like the A380 as well as military aircraft, delivered a stark warning to the British government: Give us more clarity, or we might leave the country.

The announcement, outlined in a published report and in remarks by a company executive, was unusually direct, offering a window into businesses’ concerns as Britain runs out of time to make a deal with the European Union. Though few companies have spoken out publicly, trade groups have warned repeatedly that notice of any agreement was needed to help plan for future investments and adjust accordingly.

But with Britain set to leave the bloc at the end of March, few details have been ironed out. Banks based in Britain do not know what access they will have to Continental markets, pharmaceutical companies do not know how their drugs will be regulated, and airlines are unsure whether they will need to create separate entities with headquarters abroad.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.998264729976654}",neutral,0.998264729976654,0
Plane Insider: which planes are more comfortable than others? - Lonely Planet Travel News,"Sat, 16 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxvbmVseXBsYW5ldC5jb20vbmV3cy9wbGFuZXMtY29tZm9ydGFibGUtb3RoZXJzLWpvaG4td2FsdG9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"People often ask me how they get more room when they fly, and my general rule is this: since they largely have wider seats, Airbus planes almost always give you more space than Boeing planes.

Choosing which planes have the most room can be complicated.

That rule will hold at least nine flights out of ten, but the details of the 10% can get a bit more complicated. Here’s why. Space on board modern airliners depends on three factors: legroom, elbow ­room, and the number of seats in each row. Airlines can vary the legroom as much as they like, but seat width is set depending on the number of seats in each row on a particular type of plane.

The type of aircraft and seat formation play a part in how much room you can expect.

So, let’s talk specific aircraft to pick — and to avoid. On the standard­sized six­-across planes that are the world’s most frequently seen aircraft, every Airbus A320 family (including the A318, A319 and A321) aircraft is wider than the Boeing 737 or 757 — some 15 centimetres wider, in fact. Taking into account the aisle and walls, that’s a bit less than 2.5 cm, roughly an inch, of extra space per passenger. Things are a little more complicated with larger planes, although our “Airbuses have wider seats than Boeings” rule still holds, with a few exceptions. The Boeing 767, discontinued in its passenger version but still used by a number of airlines (especially in North America and Japan), is one of the most comfortable ways to fly in economy, with wider seats and only one middle seat in the 2-­3-­2 seating layout. It’s certainly one to pick. At the same time, the Airbus A350 — which normally has very spacious wider seats in a 3­-3-­3 layout — is very narrow if, as some low ­cost and leisure/charter airlines plan to do, a tenth seat is added in each row. However, airlines doing this are very rare indeed: only small French Caribbean airline Air Caraïbes has added an extra seat so far.

Interior of Etihad Boeing 777-300 aircraft.

Airbus A380s are generally excellent, especially if you’re on one of the airlines that has an upper deck economy section, where there are only eight seats in every row instead of ten, and where each window seat gets a sizeable side storage bin. Even the 3-­4-­3 main deck is spacious, though. Some airlines’ Boeing 777 aircraft still have nine­-across seating: Singapore Airlines, Japan Airlines, Delta and Air China stand out among the larger airlines here. These seats are nice and wide, and there’s only one middle seat in each section of the 3­-3­-3 layout. But the majority of airlines now use a 3­-4-­3 configuration on the 777, which is very narrow and has two middle seats in the centre section. Book the 777 with caution.

The Boeing 787 Dreamliner, too has very narrow seats in a nine­abreast layout, which means you lose elbow room in the 3­-3­-3 configuration. Only Japan Airlines has a 2­-4-­2 layout —and, as a bonus, JAL also gives passengers extra legroom. Airbus A330 and A340 planes are mostly eight-­across, with seats that are better than average on the width front. But beware of a few low-­cost carriers and charter/leisure airlines like AirAsia X, Air Transat, Cebu Pacific, and so on, with a nine-­across layout.

If you’re connecting on regional flights, it’s a bit more granular still, with a lot of numbers! The little Bombardier C Series is a great bet with wider seats and only five seats in each row in a 2­-3 layout, as is the Embraer E­Jet family (E170/175/190/195) with wider seats and a 2­-2 configuration. But skip the Bombardier CRJ 200/700/900/1000, Embraer ERJ­134/140/145, and most propeller planes like the Bombardier Dash­8 Q100/200/Q300/Q400, or the ATR­42/72.

So, to sum up, when booking, you’ll be more comfortable on:

Airbus A320, A330*, A340, A350*, A380, Boeing 767, older 777s†, Bombardier C Series, Embraer E­170/175/190/195

* be careful on low­ cost and leisure/charter airlines like AirAsia X, Air Caraïbes, Air Transat, etc

† look at the seat map: these are the ones with nine seats in each row.

And avoid if you can:

Boeing 737, 757, 757, newer 777s*, 787†, Bombardier CRJ, Embraer ERJ, Bombardier Q400, ATR­42/72","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999997615814209}",neutral,0.999997615814209,0

Today, we’re excited to announce a partnership with Airbus, a leader in remote sensing, to enable access to each other’s data and joint cooperation on the development of new geospatial solutions.

As part of the agreement, Planet and Airbus aim to provide customers with a comprehensive suite of global remote sensing data at multiple temporal and spatial resolutions, and to collaborate on new analytic solutions for a range of commercial markets.

François Lombard, Director of the Intelligence Business at Airbus Defence and Space (left); Dirk Hoke, CEO of Airbus Defence and Space (center); and Will Marshall, CEO and co-founder of Planet (right) at the signing of the agreement at Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France.

Airbus and Planet are truly complementary partners in the sense that Airbus provides reliable, high-resolution remote sensing capabilities, and Planet brings its unique global coverage and temporal cadence, as well as rapid iteration. Together, both partners will be able to deliver new and sophisticated offerings to fit customer needs globally across markets.

“By combining our strengths, we will provide a key capability to address all market needs, both in terms of data and value-added products, and to best serve our clients, whatever their industry and their requirements” said François Lombard, Director of the Intelligence Business at Airbus Defence and Space.

Airbus’s constellation is comprised of very high-resolution Pléiades 1A and 1B; the high-resolution SPOT 6 and SPOT 7 satellites and the DMC constellation. On the radar side, TerraSAR-X, TanDEM-X, and the PAZ radar satellites ensure customers have access to any location whatever the cloud coverage. Planet operates the largest constellation of satellites in history, offering daily, global 3-5 meter resolution imagery via its over 130 PlanetScope satellites and sub-daily, sub-1 meter resolution imagery of anywhere on Earth with its constellation of 13 SkySats.

Looking ahead, Airbus and Planet can maximize their global presence in key verticals, while leveraging each other’s expertise to bring more comprehensive and advanced geospatial products to market. This partnership spans generations of aerospace innovation and reaches across borders, and Planet is looking forward to a bright future partnering with Airbus.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9929682612419128}",positive,0.9929682612419128,1
Airbus departure? Five things you need to know to understand its relationship with Britain - The Conversation,"Fri, 22 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS9haXJidXMtZGVwYXJ0dXJlLWZpdmUtdGhpbmdzLXlvdS1uZWVkLXRvLWtub3ctdG8tdW5kZXJzdGFuZC1pdHMtcmVsYXRpb25zaGlwLXdpdGgtYnJpdGFpbi05ODc5M9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has warned that a no-deal Brexit could force the aircraft manufacturer to close its UK operations, which, among other things, produce all-important wings. Here’s why other countries are circling to pick up the slack from a UK departure from the single market and customs union – and why the Airbus story has always been shaped by national politics as well as international commerce.

1. Minority stake

This story harks back to the history of Airbus. In 1970, the British, French and German governments came together to create a consortium to challenge US dominance in the market. UK airline BOAC (now part of British Airways) did not support it, and the consortium largely developed around Franco-German leadership. But the British manufacturing group Hawker Siddeley still retained design and supply of the wings to Airbus.

Then, when the UK aerospace industry came together in the late 1970s under the umbrella of British Aerospace, it bought a 20% stake in Airbus. But this was sold in 2006 for about £2 billion when British Aerospace thought that Airbus was in turmoil. So the UK has always been – at best – a minority player in Airbus.

2. Wings are complex

An airline’s wings are among the most complex part of the airframe. They comprise tens of thousands of parts that need to fit together with amazing precision. They are a blend of metals and composites that require deep expertise to both design and manufacture.

Wings therefore require high-tech, highly advanced factories and skilled people to make them. These skills do not come cheap – and such a factory requires major investment. They really are the jewel in the crown for any airframe company and the French and German parts of Airbus have been interested in creating this capability locally.

Not only this, but many of the parts in the state-of-the-art A350 wings are produced in Spain where labour is cheaper, but then assembled in the UK where the expertise is greater. So it’s not just France and Germany who are interested in wing production.

3. Not just about tariffs

The recent announcement that tariffs were the reason for the potential movement of wings is not the whole story of why wing production could move. In fact the EU charges tariffs of 0% on aircraft parts from Brazil and China. If it was just a tariffs issue, the UK government could always create a special economic zone, such as the maquiladora system in Mexico.

Special maquiladora plants are used to assemble goods from other countries for export back to the country of origin while avoiding export and import tariffs. These are typically used in low-skilled industries such as clothing and are designed to take advantage of lower labour costs rather than advanced technology. Wings are strategic – and France and Germany would want them as the move would bring jobs in high-value manufacturing.

Airbus in Europe is often viewed as a “job factory” (as one former Airbus first-tier supplier CEO told me in an interview) – with the focus being on the creation of jobs. The long-running Boeing-Airbus lawsuit at the World Trade Organisation is focused on the alleged use of illegal EU state aid to support these well-paid jobs in the development of new airframes. With the UK out of the EU, there would be no such aid, leaving it worse off competitively.

4. Logistical sense

From an efficiency point of view, having wings made in a different country to the rest of the airframe is a poor choice. Wings need to be transported by boat to France from the UK. So potential delays in their transport – such as when the Ciudad de Cadiz (one of three ships used to transport wings) ran aground in 2013 – would be avoided.

It would make logistical sense for them to be made on-site, making the operation more efficient and able to run on a truly just-in-time basis. However, efficiency has never been at the centre of Airbus’s decision-making, with components and major sections being made across Europe. The delay in the launch of the A380 “superjumbo” is one example of where the different location choices (in this case different computer design systems) was driven by political needs rather than operational expediency.

5. No guarantees

Despite the logic for Airbus moving operations, its departure from the UK is not a given. Due to the high cost of developing an aircraft, Airbus may be more interested in launch aid or tax breaks than efficiency. Plus, for the existing planes, it is very difficult to simply pack a factory up and move it somewhere else. Factories need labour and this will need to be recruited and trained.

Many companies that I have studied think that manufacturing capability can be developed in 18 months. From my experience this is highly optimistic and is more typically five to seven years. So there’s likely to be a stay of execution for at least that amount of time, as manufacturing capability and the supply chains and skills that support them cannot be turned on and off like a tap.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9932430386543274}",neutral,0.9932430386543274,0

Flying high in Airbus simulators - Airbus,"Mon, 04 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE4LTA2LWZseWluZy1oaWdoLWluLWFpcmJ1cy1zaW11bGF0b3Jz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For 11 hours each workday – and sometimes longer – the flight simulators at Airbus’ Single Test Centre, or STC, are kept busy.

It’s at the Saint-Martin campus in Toulouse, France that simulators for all Airbus commercial aircraft are housed – from in-development models that have yet to take wing, through each and every in-service model, to the Airbus aircraft of yesteryear no longer in production.

Some of the 10 simulators in building M24 are dedicated to just one aircraft family, such as the A350 XWB, while others can be configured for different variants across families. Each simulator was made in-house by Airbus personnel; the oldest one, for Airbus’ cornerstone A300/A310 aircraft, is more than 40 years old.

Unlike the simulators used at Airbus Training Centres around the world that feature the latest certified systems for a given aircraft – and which are used by airline pilots to familiarise themselves with a jetliner type – the vast majority of STC simulator users are testers, usually Airbus engineers validating new systems and upgrades to existing ones.

These engineers also perform human factor trials, observing how flight crews react to various alarms and displays.

While a typical session in an Airbus flight simulator lasts around two and a half hours, a 72-hour multi-leg world tour is possible.

Prior to an airliner’s first flight, STC simulators let Airbus engineers safely evaluate manoeuvres and scenarios that would be too dangerous to undertake in an actual flight; they also allow test flight crews to become familiar with how a new aircraft and its systems will perform during the actual test flight campaign. In addition, Airbus has been granted authority by the European Aviation Safety Agency and America’s Federal Aviation Administration to certify certain aircraft systems using these high-tech simulators.

Engineers can customise the simulators to display airport runways of various lengths and elevations to test aircraft performance in specific scenarios that can include simulated weather conditions such as snow, fog, rain, wind and turbulence. While a typical ‘flight’ in one of the simulators lasts around two and a half hours, a 72-hour world tour is possible – a multi-leg trip that would generate up to 100 gigabytes of performance data.

While the setups at Airbus’ STC and in training centres around the world feature simulated cockpits powered by computers running real-world avionics software, only STC simulators can be connected to actual working systems on a ground-based Iron Bird – a ‘skeletal’ form of an aircraft in which major working components (such as hydraulics and flight control components) are installed in the approximate locations found on the actual airframe.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999986886978149}",neutral,0.9999986886978149,0

Airbus A380s Are Starting to Be Stripped for Parts - Popular Mechanics,"Wed, 06 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHVsYXJtZWNoYW5pY3MuY29tL2ZsaWdodC9haXJsaW5lcy9hMjEwOTUzOTUvdW53YW50ZWQtYWlyYnVzLWEzODBzLWFyZS1zdGFydGluZy10by1iZS1zdHJpcHBlZC1mb3ItcGFydHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The gargantuan, double-decker, four-engine Airbus A380 is a titan of the skies, but that doesn't mean that airlines actually want to fly it. Reuters reports that two of the enormous craft, which only entered service about ten years ago, are about to be stripped for parts.

The two planes in question were operated by Singapore Airlines, which put the first Airbus A380 into operation in October of 2007. When Singapore Airlines decided to retire them before the end of their useful life, no other airlines showed considerable interest in buying the second-hand planes. So instead of flying again, the duo will be stripped of components like electronics and landing gear, although the German investment group that currently owns the planes will stop short of fully scrapping the airframes.

This move comes as part of an industry-wide shift away from enormous planes that allow airlines to focus on a ""hub and spokes"" model of organization, with planes like the A380 servicing central airports specially outfitted to accommodate its size. Instead, increasingly efficient twin-engine jets like Boeing's 737 MAX are allowing airlines to shy away from connecting flights and run longer, lower demand, non-stop flights profitably.

Airbus sees potential for A330neo sales; Boeing sees opportunity - Leeham News and Analysis,"Wed, 06 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxOC8wNi8wNi9haXJidXMtc2Vlcy1wb3RlbnRpYWwtZm9yLWEzMzBuZW8tc2FsZXMtYm9laW5nLXNlZXMtb3Bwb3J0dW5pdHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"June 6, 2018, © Leeham News: Airbus remains confident that the sales boon for the slow-selling A330neo is just around the corner, but an analysis of Airbus’ current operator lists shows significant inroads by Boeing for its 787.

LNC outlined Airbus’ strategy last December in which officials are confident the A330neo will see an uptick in orders as the current A330 operating fleet, now called the ceo, ages beginning in 2020.

The new sales chief, Eric Schulz, reiterated Airbus’ confidence at the IATA AGM this week in Sydney, Australia.

But 19% of the 109 A330 operators already ordered the 787. One, American Airlines, already announced the 787 order will replace the A330s in its fleet. Air Canada long ago made a similar announcement. Hawaiian Airlines canceled an A330-800 order in favor of the 787-9.

Aggressive pricing

Boeing engaged in aggressive pricing to win the Air Canada, Hawaiian and American deals, all with intent to displace Airbus.

Although Boeing consistently claims there is no price war, Airbus claims otherwise and Steven Udvar-Hazy, the executive chairman of Air Lease Corp—and an A330neo purchaser—says the pricing competition is “intense.”

Dual operators

Comparing the list of A330 and 787 operators, and A330 customers that ordered the 787 but do not yet operate them, some 787 orders exceed the number of A330s operated. On its face, this suggests the A330s may already be on their way out at these carriers.

Some carriers have under-ordered the 787 compared with the A330s in service.

Dual sourcing

Some A330 operators that ordered the 787, whether already in operation or yet to be delivered, have a long history of dual sourcing.

The Chinese government likes to order Airbus and Boeing aircraft, if for no other reason than to use them for political pressure against the European and US governments if and when necessary. But the requirements are sufficient that one OEM may not be able to fill the needs on a timely basis.

Potential vs reality

There are more than 1,000 A330ceos in service with more than 100 operators. There are only about 200 orders from fewer than a dozen customers.

With 19% of the A330 operators already 787 customers, fleet simplification may be an issue Airbus will have to fight against in key campaigns. It was a significant factor in the American campaign; the airline will eliminate the A330s and Boeing 767s with its follow-on order for 47 787-8s/9s.

This also makes an effort to sell the A330neo to United Airlines highly uphill. UA doesn’t operate the A330, but it does the 787, with more on order. Introducing a new fleet type is highly unlikely.

Published reports that are several months old indicated Airbus thinks it will sell upwards of 1,000 A330neos. Others believe this is widely optimistic. One pessimist puts the number at 400.

The A330neo was late to the market, coming years after the 787 entered service and after Boeing launched the 787-10 derivative. Fuel prices subsequently plunged, depressing sales.

Airbus probably had little choice in launching the airplane. The A330ceo was rapidly being overtaken by the 787 as Boeing finally straightened out this program. The potential Boeing NMA/797 will be far more economical than the A330ceo. Although the A330-800 really doesn’t cover the upper end of the potential NMA like Airbus claims, at least a low-cost entry into the upper end of the Middle of the Market is provided by the A330-800.

Airbus A330neo: TAP Air Portugal gives early look during 'proving flights' - USA TODAY,"Sat, 23 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdHJhdmVsL2ZsaWdodHMvdG9kYXlpbnRoZXNreS8yMDE4LzA2LzI0L2FpcmJ1cy0zMzAtbmVvLXRhcC1haXItcG9ydHVnYWwtZ2l2ZXMtZWFybHktbG9vay1kdXJpbmctcHJvdmluZy1mbGlnaHRzLzcyODg1MTAwMi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TAP Air Portugal uses 'proving flights' to show off new Airbus A330neo

MIAMI – Airbus' newest jet, the A330neo, visited Miami on Saturday. The plane arrived on one of a series of globe-trotting flights that will cap off a brisk, year-long test-flight program for the A330neo.

The first models of the type are expected to be delivered this fall.



The test aircraft, painted in the livery of launch customer TAP Air Portugal and almost completely configured with the airline's newest cabin update, flew in from the airline's Lisbon headquarters earlier in the day.



The flight is part of a series of flights — known as ""route-proving"" — required to show regulators the aircraft will be able to perform to the specifications Airbus has claimed. The flights test everything from fuel consumption to air flow in the cabin, meal services to baggage loading. Those types of items are generally considered among the last boxes to check in a new jet's test-flight program.



Airbus says it has 150 hours of such flights coming up, split into three stages. The first had already seen the jet visit Brazil earlier in the week, with Miami as the final stop before returning to Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France. Future stages will see the jet fly routes as long as Toulouse to Mauritius (5,670 miles) and as short as Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta (699 miles). The aircraft will also return to the U.S., visiting both Atlanta and Chicago.

MEANWHILE, THE A350 ...: Behind-the-scenes photos of Airbus' A350 assembly line (story continues below)



As the A330neo's launch customer, the occasion also allowed Lisbon-based TAP Portugal an opportunity to show off its latest cabin overhaul several months ahead of taking delivery of its first version of the aircraft.



The new cabin will feature 298 seats in total, split between 34 in the airline's new business-class and 264 in economy.

Regular business-class passengers on TAP can expect a fairly substantial upgrade from TAP's previous options. The airline chose a Recaro lie-flat seat, arranged in what's become the industry-standard 1-2-1 layout that guarantees direct-aisle access for each customer in the cabin. Other features include extra storage space, power and USB outlets, touch-button seat controls and a 16-inch swing-out inflight entertainment monitor.



The airline also chose Recaro for its economy cabin, which is split between standard coach and a 96-seat ""Economy Xtra"" section. Both seats are the same, with large seat-back monitors, headrests that adjust both on the sides and for the neck, and power outlets. Both are arranged in a 2-4-2 configuration, with 18” wide seats. The only difference between the two is pitch: 31” in coach, 34” in Xtra.



All cabins will feature Airbus' much vaunted AirSpace cabin improvements, which include larger overhead bins, new lighting options, and changes to the lavatories.

Since the particular plane shown off in Miami is still an active member of the A330neo test fleet, it also has a few features that won't exist after delivery. A test station and related equipment have been installed in the economy cabin, enough to occupy several rows worth of seats in the center of the cabin. Airbus engineers use the station to collect and analyse performance data for the aircraft.



TAP is expected to utilize most of the 21 A330neo jets on order to replace its existing fleet of current-generation Airbus A330s and A340s.

That's a replacement scenario Airbus sales teams are undoubtedly hoping to replicate among carriers now flying the approximately 1,200 older A330s already in service.



Both versions of the A330neo, a -900 and a smaller longer range -800, are intended to be direct replacements of the original A330-300 that first began flying 25 years ago. The newer versions can fly up to 20% more efficiently, Airbus says, in large part thanks to new, larger Rolls Royce engines, along with aerodynamic improvements and introduction of cross-over technology from Airbus' A350 program. Both versions of the neo are able to seat marginally more passengers than current-generation A330s.



But the neo's order book has struggled to gain traction since it first flew for Airbus in October 2017. The program claimed 212 firm orders at the time, but that tally has not changed substantially since. The -800 currently has no orders at all, after sole customer Hawaiian Airlines defected in favor of Boeing 787s in March.



“It's a slow burn,” acknowledges Thomas Burger, Airbus' A30 marketing director, before adding that Airbus expects orders to begin to flow as current-generation A330s retire.



Even Airbus' own chart emphasizes a long game: while the A330neo is due to enter service this year, the bulk of older model A330s needing replacement doesn't begin in earnest for another six years.



“We don't give it up if it's slow for a few years,” said Burger. “We know the market is out there. If we give it up, we lose that market,” he said.

Contractual model is based on the successful Heron 1 contract

Includes five reconnaissance drone systems capable of carrying weapons

Berlin, 14 June 2018 - Airbus and the Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support (BAAINBw) have signed an operator agreement for Heron TP unmanned aerial systems (UAS) after parliamentary approval was granted on 13 June 2018.



The contract includes both the provision of Heron TP UAS as well as all operational services required for the system. In accordance with German budget law, the contract will become effective upon publication of the federal budget.

Heron 1 drones, which are currently deployed by the German Armed Forces in Afghanistan and Mali, are to be replaced by the more powerful IAI (Israel Aerospace Industries) made Heron which is already fully operational with the Israeli Air Force, although the contract between the Bundeswehr and Airbus is based on this previously successful model. Industry will ensure system performance, flight hours and availability and enable soldiers to focus fully on their respective missions.

The project will have a two-year set-up phase, followed by an operational phase lasting a further seven years, thereby bridging the gap until a sovereign European drone will be developed.

“This project will provide the Bundeswehr with an even more efficient system that will better protect soldiers in a wide range of threat situations as well as the at-risk civilian population,” said Jana Rosenmann, Head of Unmanned Aerial Systems at Airbus. “The modular concept will allow us to provide the Bundeswehr with the capabilities it needs on time for the years to come.”

Shaul Shahar, IAI EVP and General Manager of the Military Aircraft Group, said, “We are thrilled and proud of this agreement with the Federal Ministry of Defence, a major strategic customer. The Heron TP is a first rate strategic RPAS. Its strong performance will provide Germany with unprecedented air superiority. We would like to thank the German government for this vote of confidence built over many years. We are committed to preserving the quality of our service and systems and look forward to continued collaboration.”

Under the terms of the basic contract, the Bundeswehr will receive five aircraft equipped for reconnaissance missions and capable of carrying weapons, four sets of ground segments, training environments and all system operational services. The basic contract also includes preparing the drones for their use in future countries of operation.

The systems are equipped with electro-optic and infrared sensors and imaging radar systems to perform far-reaching reconnaissance tasks. Satellite communication systems and German data and voice encryption systems are also part of the configuration.

The UAVs are kitted out with a weather radar system so that they can operate in bad weather conditions.

The MALE HERON TP system will get military certification from the German Armed Forces aviation authority in accordance with STANAG 4671 allowing the system to be used around the world. This is supplemented by the integration of collision avoidance capabilities.

As was the case with the previous model, the Heron 1, Airbus as prime contractor will closely collaborate with Israeli company Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd (IAI). Complementing its role as prime contractor, Airbus is already a Heron TP design organisation approved by the German Armed Forces aviation authority and will also become the approved Heron TP manufacturing and maintenance organisation for the project.

Airbus Helicopters and Safran roll out major competitiveness boost to H125 and H130 - Airbus,"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wNi1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtYW5kLXNhZnJhbi1yb2xsLW91dC1tYWpvci1jb21wZXRpdGl2ZW5lc3MtYm9vc3TSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Marignane, Airbus H125 and H130 helicopter customers will get a boost in their operations thanks to a significant reduction in direct maintenance costs for the Safran Arriel 2D engine, which equips both single engines. The two main improvements provided by Safran are the extension of 25 % of the time between overhaul (TBO) to 5,000 hours for new and in-service helicopters, and the new three year/ 2,000 hours warranty conditions – replacing the previous two year/1,000 hours warranty – for all H125 and H130 helicopters delivered in 2018.

“Safran continuously works to make its engines more robust and easy-to-use”, says Nicolas Billecocq, Safran Helicopter Engines’ vice president of the Light Helicopter Engines Program. “Extensive endurance tests conducted on the Arriel 2D and analysis of engine fleet data have enabled us to further validate the engine’s strength and simplicity. Thanks to these new improvements, the Arriel 2D will feature one of the lowest direct maintenance costs of its class.”

“Improving customer satisfaction and the competitiveness of our products is one of our top priorities at Airbus Helicopters. These engine durability enhancements are a clear illustration of our efforts in this direction,” said Axel Aloccio, Head of the Light Helicopter Programme at Airbus Helicopters. “The TBO and warranty extension are very concrete improvements for H125 and H130 operators around the world: those two types keep offering the best value for money

” H125 and H130 customers will also benefit from the removal of the calendar limitation, which until now required an engine inspection at a repair centre every 15 years, regardless of the number of hours logged. The robustness of the Arriel 2D eliminates the need for a calendar limit on modules 1, 2, 4 and 5, while for module 3, the engine’s condition can be restored during a periodic visit performed at a maintenance centre.

The H125 and H130 lead the single-engine helicopter market, accounting for almost 70% of deliveries in the last five years. The H125 outclasses all other single-engines thanks to its performance in high and hot environments, versatility and low operating costs. The H130 is the quietest and safest helicopter in its class, having become the reference for passenger transport. More than 1,000 Arriel 2D-equipped H125 and H130 helicopters are in service worldwide and have collectively logged over one million flight hours. The Arriel 2D offers extremely competitive operating costs, 10% lower in average than those of earlier variants. The Arriel 2D is also backed by a complete Safran service package, notably the Support By the Hour (SBH®) contract and the 5Star programme, fully adapted to customers operating fewer than five helicopters.

Bombardier describes its C Series as a single-aisle commercial jet aimed at the 100 to 150-seat market, built with advanced aluminum and composites and boasting 18 percent lower costs per passenger.

The main C series office and primary assembly line will be located in Mirabel, Québec and will use Airbus’s “worldwide influence to benefit production, marketing and sales of the airplane,” the planemaker said. The Airbus-Bombardier partnership was announced last October after the C Series project faced risks due to rising costs, slow sales and production delays.

“Airbus will work with its partners Bombardier and IQ to fully unlock the C Series’ potential and create significant new value for customers, suppliers, employees, shareholders and the communities in which the partnership operates,” Airbus said.

The C Series is projected to claim a significant share of an estimated need for 6,000 aircraft in the 100 to 150-seat market which will result in a second final assembly line being created for the C Series in Mobile, Alabama. This will aid supplying the aircraft to American airline customers, according to Airbus.

Alain Bellemare, president and CEO of Bombardier said, “Airbus’ unmatched global scale, strong customer relationships and operational expertise are necessary ingredients for unleashing the full value of the aircraft. Together, we will create tremendous new value and opportunities for airlines, suppliers, shareholders and employees.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9998972415924072}",positive,0.9998972415924072,1

Patterned after the naming structure used for introductory collegiate classes, the “Airbus 101” day provided an opportunity to introduce the company to undergraduates and brief them about global trends in the aerospace industry.

Speakers included representatives from the Airbus office in Seoul, the company’s commercial aircraft and the defence and space divisions, the regional innovation team, as well as executives from the Airbus-ATR regional airliner joint venture.

Airbus also supported a university competition that challenged the undergraduates to come up with ideas that could improve the aviation industry. Six teams made it to the final round, which was held on 5 June, with ideas presented to their peers.

Their concepts included a redesigned aircraft seat tray table that provides more space for passengers, seat sensors that let flight attendants know if individual passengers are prepared for take-off and landing, and foldable aircraft wings that help to save space in a hangar.

The top three teams, as judged by a panel of Airbus executives, won the opportunity to visit the company’s headquarters in Toulouse, France. There, they will get the opportunity to learn more about Airbus operations and visit the company’s final assembly lines.

“This was an excellent opportunity to meet the future members of Korea’s aviation industry, introduce them to Airbus, and discuss the latest issues in the aerospace industry,” said Thomas Friedberger, President, Airbus Korea. “We also were very impressed with the presentations.

Airbus Rattles the Beluga XL in the Name of Safety - WIRED,"Fri, 08 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9haXJidXMtYmVsdWdhLXhsLXRlc3Rpbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It was a balmy evening, and Airbus was walking out of Le Cafe des Nuages with its date when a hoodlum jumped in front of the pair, held a commercial airliner to Airbus' neck, and demanded its wallet. Airbus chuckled. ""That's not a plane,"" it said. ""This is a plane."" And it pulled out a Beluga. The would-be mugger took one look and fled.

So, the Crocodile Dundee thing didn't actually happen, but if the European planemaker did find itself in a size contest, the Beluga would be hard to beat. Since 1995, Airbus has used the comically bulbous aircraft to transport oversize, unwieldy cargo like fuselages and wings between its European production and assembly plants.

Now, Airbus is going even bigger, with the Beluga XL. The new generation of the transporter plane, in development since 2014, is based on Airbus’ twin-engine A330-200 freighter, and, like its predecessor, does an outstanding impression of Will Ferrell’s Megamind. It will be 20 feet longer and three feet wider than the original. It will also be able to lift six more tons, but weight matters less here than that extra space: The outgoing Beluga can only carry one wing of the popular A350 XWB airliner; the XL can carry both.

If all goes according to plan, the company will put the first Beluga XL into service next year, then build four more to round out the fleet. This being aviation, the new jet must brave a series of torments before it can swing open its front-mounted cargo door and gulp down whatever needs transporting, and this week, Airbus announced the XL had cleared another hurdle: the static ground vibration test.

Conducted by the DLR (the German equivalent of NASA) and French aerospace lab Onera, the test involves 14 electrodynamic shakers, which are basically long metal poles attached to various bits of the aircraft: the tail, the wing tips, the engines. These thin rods then piston back and forth, some of them applying up to 670 Newtons of force, to make the whole thing vibrate.

Meanwhile, 600 sensors, connected by 23,000 feet of cable, measure the acceleration and displacement of the Beluga’s fuselage, engines, wings, and empennage (that’s the fancy collective term for the horizontal and vertical stabilizers, and rudder on the tail).

The point of this shakedown is to improve Airbus’ understanding of how its plane will behave in the air, to verify or update its computer models. It’s also key for ensuring the plane won’t fall victim to flutter, where parts of the aircraft start to oscillate, increasing in amplitude until things start breaking. Flutter is what triggered the famous swaying and collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge—aka Galloping Gerdie—in 1940. And of all the things you want your airplane wings not to do, rollicking is right up there with snapping off.

The Beluga XL spent eight days being poked and prodded, first with an empty fuselage, then fully loaded with cargo. Airbus says it’s pleased with the results—no galloping to be seen—and that this whale of an airplane is on track to make its maiden flight later this summer.

A whale of a transport aircraft will be flying high later this summer sporting the grin of a Beluga whale.

The Airbus BelugaXL, a massive transport plane, made a presentation on Thursday, its nose cone making it look like a whale. Airbus employees, 20,000 of them, voted on one of six looks and the whale face that matches its name won.

After ground tests, the oversized aircraft is to make its first flight later this summer and enter service in 2019.

Hawaiian Airlines has taken delivery of its first U.S.-produced A321. The aircraft, delivered from the Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility in Mobile, Alabama, is also the first new engine option aircraft (NEO) delivered from Airbus’ U.S. facility. It is powered by a Pratt & Whitney PW1000G high-bypass geared turbofan engine. Executives and employees from Airbus and Hawaiian, and executives from Pratt & Whitney and UTC Aerospace Systems witnessed the milestone delivery.

Bob Lekites, Executive Vice President-Customers, Airbus Americas said, “Airbus understands the challenging airline marketplace and has continued to stay on the cutting edge of developing and producing aircraft that exceed industry standards in safety, efficiency and reliability. Hawaiian has recognized the Airbus commitment to innovation and we could not be more proud to deliver on this promise to them with our first U.S.-manufactured A321neo aircraft.”

“We are honored to accept the delivery of the first A321neo from the Airbus Manufacturing facility,” said Jon Snook, executive vice president and chief operating officer at Hawaiian Airlines. “The A321neo is the ideal aircraft for us to share our Hawaiian hospitality with more guests as we grow our western U.S. network and provide greater access to our entire island chain. We look forward to more deliveries from Mobile.”

Hawaiian currently offers daily non-stop A321neo flights from Portland and Long Beach to Honolulu. The carrier will announce additional A321neo routes between the U.S. West Coast and the Hawaiian Islands as it welcomes a total of 18 aircraft through 2020.

Offering the lowest operating costs in its class, the A321neo operates 15 percent more efficiently than its A321ceo predecessor and by 2020 will operate at 20 percent more efficiently.

Demonstrating the adage “The Sun Never Sets on Airbus Manufacturing,” Airbus aircraft are now produced around the clock, 24 hours a day, at facilities in Mobile, Alabama; Hamburg, Germany; Toulouse, France; and Tianjin, China.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5744621157646179}",neutral,0.5744621157646179,0
Airbus Plans Drone Delivery Service at Singapore Anchorage - The Maritime Executive,"Wed, 06 Jun 2018 00:39:40 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vbWFyaXRpbWUtZXhlY3V0aXZlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2FpcmJ1cy1wbGFucy1kcm9uZS1kZWxpdmVyeS1zZXJ2aWNlLWF0LXNpbmdhcG9yZS1hbmNob3JhZ2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At the Posidonia conference on Tuesday, Wilhelmsen Ships Service announced a partnership with Airbus to test shore-to-ship drone delivery services at the Port of Singapore.

The new service - called Agency by Air - will test a concept that has been explored by others (including Maersk Tankers) but has not yet been deployed on a large scale. ""When we announced last year that we were pursuing drone delivery, we were greeted with a fair amount of skepticism, but our collaboration with Airbus shows we really do mean business,"" said Marius Johansen, VP commercial, ships agency at Wilhelmsen Ships Service (WSS). ""We organize the delivery of essential spares, medical supplies and cash to master via launch boat day in and day out all over the world. However, delivery by drone is much more cost effective, quicker, and frankly safer for all involved."" According to Johansen, airborne drone delivery could be fully 90 percent less expensive than delivery by launch boats.

Airbus, WSS, Singapore's Maritime Port Authority and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore have been involved in planning the test for some time. As a first step, they intend to conduct a two-week trial with deliveries to ships anchored up to 1.5 nm offshore in Singapore's eastern anchorage. The team is planning to set up two control and delivery station pierside, including a location at Marina South.

A drone designed to deliver

The Airbus Skyways octocopter is specifically designed for parcel delivery in dense urban centers, and it made its maiden flight at the National University of Singapore earlier this year. Airbus Helicopters began the Skyways project with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore in 2016, with Singapore Post (SingPost) as the local logistics partner. “Safe and reliable urban air delivery is a reality not too distant into the future, and Airbus is certainly excited to be a forerunner in this endeavor,"" said Airbus Helicopters chief technical officer Alain Flourens at the time of the flight.

Airbus envisions two pilot test cases for Skyways - a ships' agency anchorage delivery service (with WSS) and the delivery of parcels at the University of Singapore. On campus, the drone will autonomously navigate between designated delivery stations to transport small packages for students and faculty members (infographic below).","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999880790710449}",neutral,0.9999880790710449,0

Dr. Peters Group announced that it will strip down two off-lease Airbus A380s and sell them as spare parts.

The German investment firm expects the pair of ex-Singapore Airlines planes to generate $80 million apiece.

The Airbus A380 entered service in 2007 with great fanfare. A decade later, the arrival of an Airbus Superjumbo remains an event to behold.

But, the A380 has not been the game-changer Airbus had hoped it would become when it conceived the massive double-decker. This is especially the case on the financial front.

For much of its service life, Airbus has struggled to find airlines willing to put the A380 into service. And now aircraft leasing companies are facing the same struggles. In fact, the market for second hand, off-lease A380s is virtually non-existent.

On Tuesday, Dr. Peters Group announced that two of its Airbus A380s will be stripped down and sold for spare parts after the company failed to find any takers for its second-hand superjumbos.

""The market for the A380-800 aircraft type has not developed positively in recent years,"" Dr. Peters Group CEO Anselm Gehling said in a statement. ""Some airlines have canceled orders from Airbus, while others have opted for smaller long-haul jets.""

The German investment firm expects the two ex-Singapore Airlines planes to generate $80 million of income each.

The depreciation is fairly jarring when you consider that a new A380 carried a $300 million price tag back in 2007 when these planes were built. While a new A380 today has a list price of $445.6 million.

According to Reuters, the $40 million it costs to refurbish a used A380's interior is a major turn off for many in the market for a second-hand superjumbo.

The two soon-to-be-disassembled planes are believed to be the third and fifth A380s ever built. A third ex-Singapore A380 did find a new a home. The sixth A380 built will enter into service with Portuguese charter airline Hi-Fly this summer.

Airbus provides update on impact of Brexit No Deal/Deal scenarios - Airbus,"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wNi1haXJidXMtcHJvdmlkZXMtdXBkYXRlLW9uLWltcGFjdC1vZi1icmV4aXQtbm8tZGVhbGRlYWwtc2NlbmFyaW9z0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 21 June 2018 - Airbus has today published a risk assessment outlining the urgent risks to its business arising from the UK exiting the European Union without a withdrawal agreement.

It states that the UK exiting the EU next year without a deal – therefore leaving both the single market and customs union immediately and without any agreed transition – would lead to severe disruption and interruption of UK production. This scenario would force Airbus to reconsider its investments in the UK, and its long-term footprint in the country, severely undermining UK efforts to keep a competitive and innovative aerospace industry, developing high value jobs and competences.

On the future trade relationship between the UK and EU, the Memorandum makes clear that while an orderly Brexit with a withdrawal agreement is preferable to a no-deal scenario, the current planned transition (which ends in December 2020) is too short for the EU and UK Governments to agree the outstanding issues, and too short for Airbus to implement the required changes with its extensive supply chain. In this scenario, Airbus would carefully monitor any new investments in the UK and refrain from extending the UK suppliers/partners base.

Tom Williams, Chief Operating Officer of Airbus Commercial Aircraft, commented:

“In any scenario, Brexit has severe negative consequences for the UK aerospace industry and Airbus in particular. Therefore, immediate mitigation measures would need to be accelerated. While Airbus understands that the political process must go on, as a responsible business we require immediate details on the pragmatic steps that should be taken to operate competitively. Without these, Airbus believes that the impacts on our UK operations could be significant. We have sought to highlight our concerns over the past 12 months, without success. Far from Project Fear, this is a dawning reality for Airbus. Put simply, a No Deal scenario directly threatens Airbus’ future in the UK.”

"Allegiant to invest $50M by basing 2 Airbus planes at McGhee Tyson, will create 66 jobs - Knoxville News Sentinel","Wed, 20 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtub3huZXdzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE4LzA2LzIwL2FsbGVnaWFudC1haXItYmFzZS0yLWFpcmJ1cy1wbGFuZXMtbWNnaGVlLXR5c29uLWludmVzdC01MC1tLzcxNTk5NTAwMi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Allegiant to invest $50M by basing 2 Airbus planes at McGhee Tyson, will create 66 jobs

Permanently basing two Airbus jets at McGhee Tyson Airport is likely to mean more frequent discount flights to more destinations in Knoxville’s future, Allegiant Air announced Wednesday.

Hillary Gray, director of corporate communications for Allegiant, joined Gov. Bill Haslam and local officials to announce the $50 million investment. That includes wages on up to 66 new jobs, local operating costs and possible minor upgrades to the space Allegiant already rents at the airport, Gray said.

New destinations?

“It also adds opportunities to add flights and routes into the future,” she said.

Gray wouldn’t disclose any possible new destinations, but said “rest assured that there’s going to be more to come.”

There is no schedule anticipated for announcing any such changes, she said. Currently Allegiant flies from Knoxville to Washington, D.C.; New York City; Las Vegas, Nevada; and five Florida destinations, at base prices from $34 to $88, according to Allegiant’s website.

Allegiant flies 27 routes total out of five Tennessee cities, she said. Twenty-two of those routes are not offered by other carriers, an Allegiant news release said.

Knoxville is Allegiant’s 15th base of operations in the country and its first in Tennessee, Gray said. The company’ other recently-established bases are Indianapolis, Indiana; and making Destin, Florida, a year-round base instead of seasonal, she said.

Allegiant is switching to all Airbus jets by the end of 2018, Gray said. The Knoxville base will start with two 166-seat planes, but more aircraft could be stationed here in the future, she said.

Official response

Haslam and other speakers sat in a semicircle on a small stage set up on McGhee Tyson terminal’s second floor, flanked by banners for Allegiant and the airport, with passengers streaming past on both sides.

“When we look to recruit companies or folks to move here, one of the key questions is always about air service,” Haslam said.

Eddie Mannis, board chairman of the Metropolitan Knoxville Airport Authority, said 2017 was a record year for McGhee Tyson Airport.

“We saw our passengers reach almost 2 million, making it the busiest year in our history,” he said and so far this year passenger numbers are up again.

Knoxville Mayor Madeline Rogero thanked all officials and agencies involved in securing the base. Having planes stationed here permanently will position Knoxville better for future Allegiant service expansions, she said.

Knox County Mayor Tim Burchett, now running for Congress, said Allegiant’s commitment will make business recruiting easier and heralds more convenient travel for residents.

Mitch Steenrod, chairman of the public/private nonprofit Competitive Airfare Partnership and a senior vice president at Pilot Flying J, said CAP looks forward to route expansions; his group’s mission is to recruit more air carriers and keep ticket prices down, he said.

Blount County Mayor Ed Mitchell thanked the airport authority for its long partnership with regional governments. McGhee Tyson Airport is central to drawing tourists, who are likely to return, he said.

“No one ever visits this area once,” Mitchell said.

Bryan McCarter, vice mayor of Sevier County, spoke on behalf of the county’s governments and many tourism groups in hailing the announcement.

“Tourism is our lifeblood in Sevier County,” he said, pointing out posters for Dollywood hanging on nearby walls.

Jobs and passengers

Allegiant will be hiring up to 66 people, probably a combination of locals and transfers, Gray said. Those will include pilots, flight attendants, maintenance, ground crew and other support jobs, she said.

While pay will vary by position, it’s likely to average $80,000 to $90,000 per year, Gray said. Applicants can go to www.allegiant.com/careers.

Allegiant’s service at Knoxville began in 2006 with a single flight to St. Petersburg/Clearwater, Florida, Gray said. In the ensuing 12 years, 2.5 million people have flown Allegiant through McGhee Tyson Airport, she said.

While most major carriers cater to business travelers, Allegiant focuses on leisure: students, vacationers and family visitors, Gray said. The Knoxville area offers all those.

The Las Vegas-based company employs more than 4,000 nationwide, the news release said. Beginning in 1998, it now has more than 80 planes flying 300 routes.

American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines and United Airlines also offer flights from the airport.

McGhee Tyson runway project

Opened in 1930, McGhee Tyson Airport is 12 miles south of Knoxville in northern Blount County, on 2,000 acres off Alcoa Highway. It is undergoing a full rebuilding and lengthening of its runways, a more than $100 million multiphase project, paid mostly from federal funds.

The airport awaits at least one more major federal appropriation for the work, but the runway project is still expected to be complete in late 2020 or early 2021, said Caitlin Darras, senior public relations specialist for the airport authority.

The airport’s runways were already able to handle any domestic commercial jet, but more room was expected to make it more attractive for longer flights which need to carry more fuel, such as to the West Coast. McGhee Tyson is also home base for the Tennessee Air National Guard 134th Air Refueling Wing, which operates Boeing KC-135 tankers from the field. Those planes need 10,000 feet of runway when fully loaded with fuel.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998393058776855}",neutral,0.9998393058776855,0

Airbus and Thai Airways International (THAI) have signed an agreement to establish a new joint venture maintenance and overhaul (MRO) facility at U-Tapao International Airport near Bangkok.

The accord was signed today at Airbus headquarters in Toulouse by Usanee Sangsingkeo, Acting President, THAI; and Eric Schulz, Chief Commercial Officer, Airbus, in the presence of Prayut Chan-o-cha, Prime Minister of Thailand and Guillaume Faury, President Airbus Commercial Aircraft.

The new MRO centre will be one of the most modern and extensive in the Asia-Pacific region, offering heavy maintenance and line services for all widebody aircraft types. The facility will feature the latest digital technologies to analyse aircraft maintenance data, as well as advanced inspection techniques, including the use of drones to monitor aircraft airframes.

The MRO complex will also have specialised repair shops, including for composite structures, as well as a maintenance training centre offering extensive courses for technical personnel from Thailand and overseas.

“THAI and Airbus have undertaken extensive studies to validate the business plan for this exciting project,” said Usanee Sangsingkeo, Acting President, THAI. “Together we will develop one of the most advanced and efficient aircraft maintenance centres anywhere in the world. We are confident that this venture will bring significant economic benefit for THAI and will be a major driver in the development of the wider aerospace sector in Thailand.”

“We are pleased to enter into this major agreement with THAI,” said Guillaume Faury, President Airbus Commercial Aircraft. “This will further strengthen the long-term partnership between our two companies and also contribute to the success of Thailand’s new eastern economic zone. With the fleet of widebody aircraft in the Asia-Pacific region set to triple to around 4,800 aircraft over the next 20 years, the project represents a sound business opportunity for both our companies.”

“This latest agreement further consolidates our long and special partnership with THAI,” said Eric Schulz, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer. “This dates back to 1977, when THAI became one of our earliest customers. Since that time Thai has operated every single Airbus type and today flies the complete current widebody family – the A330, the A350 and the A380.”

The joint venture between Airbus and THAI will be located at U-Tapao International Airport, at the heart of Thailand’s Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC). The EEC is a core part of the Thai government’s Thailand 4.0 policy, designed to develop world class innovative technology-based manufacturing and services in the country.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9465126991271973}",neutral,0.9465126991271973,0

Paris, 25/06/2018 - The Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency of Thailand (GISTDA) has selected Airbus as partner for its next-generation national geo-information system. The end-to-end system will make Thailand one of the few nations able to fully exploit geo-information for societal benefits. Fully in line with Thailand’s 4.0 policy, the THEOS-2 programme will constitute a major milestone in the development of Space in the Eastern Economic Corridor and its Digital Park.

As part of the contract, a comprehensive capacity building programme will involve Thai engineers in the development of an integrated geo-information system, ground segment and two Earth observation satellites: a very high-resolution and a small satellite system. The small satellite system from Airbus’ subsidiary SSTL will be assembled and tested in-country by Thai engineers to deliver technology transfer and involve local suppliers. This will be complemented by an extensive training scheme capitalizing on Airbus’ comprehensive geo-intelligence expertise, and will further develop Thailand’s geo-spatial industry.

“We are very pleased to be working with Airbus to jointly develop an innovative end-to-end geo-information platform that will become a national centre of excellence,” said Dr. Anond Snidvongs, Executive Director of GISTDA. “The platform will host and exploit multi-source data in an interoperable and integrated manner. The resulting insights will be key sources of information for Thai leaders and will help them deliver Actionable Intelligence Policy (AIP): tools for area-based management and decision-making.”

Dr. Anond Snidvongs added: “Many users will access the system, from policy-makers to local users. Ultimately, THEOS-2 will be leveraged to develop Thailand national skills in the whole Space value chain.”

“Being selected by GISTDA for the THEOS-2 programme, Airbus is continuing the successful relationship developed with THEOS-1, and we are of course very honoured by GISTDA’s continued confidence in us,” said Nicolas Chamussy, Head of Space Systems at Airbus. “With our unrivalled expertise across the entire Earth observation value chain, we are in an excellent position to support an ambitious and determined organisation like GISTDA to establish an all-encompassing geo-information system for the benefit of the Kingdom of Thailand.”

From the early stages of the programme, GISTDA will feed its geo-information system with satellite imagery collected by the Airbus constellation of optical and radar Earth observation satellites Pléiades, SPOT, TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X, as well as other sources of data.

An optical satellite system delivering 0.5 m ground resolution imagery, THEOS-2 is based on Airbus’ innovative, flight-proven AstroBus-S satellite. Scheduled to be launched in 2020, it will secure the service continuity of THEOS-1, an Airbus-built satellite launched in 2008, which continues to deliver high quality imagery four years after its expected end of life. With the AstroBus-S satellite, Thailand is joining a small circle of nations with sovereign access to very high-resolution geostrategic information.

Airbus jetliners: A standard-setting history - Airbus,"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE4LTA2LWFpcmJ1cy1qZXRsaW5lcnMtYS1zdGFuZGFyZC1zZXR0aW5nLWhpc3RvcnnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Born of an idea in the 1960s to create a viable European aviation partnership, Airbus pooled the resources, talents and expertise of its partner nations to form a consortium capable of successfully competing in the competitive global market for civil jetliners. Air travel was booming with more people wanting to fly less expensively, and Airbus positioned itself to meet that demand.

Airbus was formally launched on 18 December 1970, and from the beginning, its founders recognised that in order to differentiate itself, the company would need to embrace a philosophy bringing together innovation with operational efficiency in a new generation of airliners. The company’s initial offering, the A300, did just that.

A300 and A310: widebody size with the benefits of commonality

In an era when three engines were considered the minimum for widebody aircraft, Airbus made the bold decision to go with only twin-jet configuration. Choosing an optimised airframe cross-section, the A300 was smaller, lighter and more economical than its three-engine rivals. Not only did the A300B variant become the world’s first twin-engine widebody jetliner, it also featured the pioneering use of high-tech composite materials on a passenger aircraft.

Combining the airframe design and powerful engines with an increased-lift wing also enabled the A300 to reach cruise altitude sooner. Demonstration tours around the world helped convince airlines that Airbus had created a real competitor with its economical, innovative and comfortable aircraft.

Airbus continued the momentum by developing the A310, which like the A300, was developed in direct consultation with airlines. This shorter-fuselage, longer-range version expanded the use of composite materials in the airframe, while retaining the same 222-inch fuselage cross-section that provided passengers with cabin space and comfort. It also incorporated an industry-changing concept that would become a cornerstone of Airbus’ success: maximum commonality. The A310 marked the beginning of the “Airbus family” in which variants of a base model share common parts and cockpit layouts, making different models easy and economical for airlines to bring into their fleets.

A300 Birth of a Saga Episode 1: A European ambition show more show less During the 1969 Paris Air Show, the A300 is officially born in the form of a joint partnership between Europeans – a bold vision that could have foundered without the passion and commitment of Airbus pioneers. Some of these early leaders – including Felix Kracht, Bernard Ziegler and Gunther Scherer – discuss the A300 programme in this retrospective clip.

To differentiate itself in a field dominated by the traditional aircraft producers of the era, Airbus embraced innovation for its products.

The A320 Family: the birth of an industry leader

Having established the company’s capabilities with widebody aircraft, Airbus next focused on the single-aisle market with the A320 Family. Building on innovations in the A300 Family that saw the introduction of electrical signalling on secondary flight controls, Airbus sought to further replace the web of cables and pulleys in an aircraft’s flight control system. Enter the computer-controlled digital fly-by-wire system pioneered by Airbus: no longer mechanically driven, the flight control surfaces were now linked to computers that made the aircraft respond as the pilot commanded. In place of the pilot’s control column was a simple sidestick control, which became another staple of Airbus design.

These fly-by-wire controls – the first to be used in a civil aircraft – brought improved handling, enhanced safety, reduced weight, and operational commonality to the company’s range of aircraft, and are now commonly used in the commercial airliners. No matter how one aircraft varies in size or weight from another, fly-by-wire commonality allows the pilot to fly them in the same way because the computer drives the aircraft’s flight controls. The result is a dramatic reduction in the time and cost required to train pilots and crews across the Airbus product line of fly-by-wire jetliners.

Today, the single-aisle A320 Family is the most successful and versatile jetliner family ever. Building on the concept of commonality that Airbus championed, the family can be thought of as one aircraft in four sizes – the A318, A319, A320 and A321.

A330 and A340: Airbus moves to widebodies

With the A320 unveiled to the world, Airbus refocussed on the widebody market with the medium- to long-range A330 twin-engine and longer-range A340 four-engine aircraft. These were launched jointly in 1987, just four months after the A320’s first flight. It marked another Airbus milestone: the world’s first combined aircraft programme, with both models sharing the same basic fuselage, wing and tail.

The A330 and A340 offered extensive cockpit system commonality, not only between themselves, but with the A320 Family as well. This made possible the Airbus concepts of cross-crew qualification – pilots trained to fly one Airbus aircraft could qualify to operate another with relatively little extra training – and mixed fleet flying, in which airlines are able to switch their Airbus aircraft and pilot crews to better match capacity to demand.

With an overall length of 75.3 metres, the A340-600 is the longest-fuselage jetliner ever built by Airbus.

A380: The iconic double-deck flagship

Officially presented in January 2005, the Airbus A380 won plaudits for its size and imaginative style. As the world’s largest and most spacious passenger aircraft, the company’s flagship double-deck jetliner quickly became a passenger favourite – with the worldwide fleet crossing the globe on routes to Asia, the Middle East, Europe and North America.

The A380 was launched in recognition of the fact that air traffic continues to double every 15 years. Airbus understood that airport congestion could best be solved with an airliner capable of moving more passengers at once; with more seats than any other aircraft, the A380 offers solutions to overcrowding, needing fewer journeys to carry 60 percent more passengers than any other jetliner.

The world’s largest and most spacious passenger aircraft, Airbus’ flagship double-deck A380 quickly became a passenger favourite.

Malaysia Airlines operates a fleet of A380s, including the milestone 100th aircraft built in the very large aircraft programme.

A350 XWB: the world’s most modern and efficient jetliner

The widebody A350 XWB entered commercial service in January 2015 as the world’s most modern and efficient jetliner. Drawing upon Airbus’ heritage as an innovative aviation leader, the family of twin-engine jetliners feature a revolutionary adaptive wing design inspired by birds that morphs during flight to achieve maximum aerodynamic efficiency.

Like its predecessors, the A350 XWB family benefits from the use of advanced materials, combining the extensive us of carbon composites along with titanium and modern aluminium alloys. Together, they create a lighter and cost-efficient jetliner that also boasts reduced maintenance requirements. The combination of these advantages results in 25 percent lower operating costs, fuel burn and C02 emissions compared to previous-generation aircraft – highlighting Airbus’ commitment to protecting the environment while remaining at the cutting edge of air travel.

The NEO programme: making great airplanes even better

In December 2010, Airbus announced new fuel-saving engines for the single-aisle A319, A320 and A321 jetliners. Dubbed NEO, for new engine option, the programme also introduced new wingtip devices – the upturned ends of the wings – called Sharklets that reduce drag-inducing vortices.

Together, the changes resulted in a 15 percent reduction in fuel consumption, two tonnes of additional payload capacity, up to 500 more nautical miles of range, lower operating costs, and reductions in engine noise and emissions – all while retaining 95 percent commonality with the A320ceo (current engine option) aircraft.

Four years later, Airbus brought the NEO concept to the A330, also offering reduced fuel consumption and improved range.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6602447628974915}",positive,0.6602447628974915,1
Airbus plans UK job cuts amid fears of hard Brexit impact - The Guardian,"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDE4L2p1bi8yMi9haXJidXMtcGxhbnMtdWstY3V0cy1hbWlkLWZlYXJzLW9mLWhhcmQtYnJleGl0LWltcGFjdNIBZmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDE4L2p1bi8yMi9haXJidXMtcGxhbnMtdWstY3V0cy1hbWlkLWZlYXJzLW9mLWhhcmQtYnJleGl0LWltcGFjdA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has confirmed it is considering cutting thousands of jobs in the UK as it starts to “press the button on crisis actions” over concerns about Brexit.

The company said it could ditch plans to build aircraft wings in British factories over concerns that EU regulations will no longer apply from March 2019 and uncertainty over customs procedures, instead opting to transfer production to North America, China or elsewhere in the EU.

Airbus, which directly employs 14,000 people at 25 sites in Britain and supports more than 100,000 jobs in the wider supply chain, also said a no-deal scenario would lead to “catastrophic” consequences , which could cost the company billions of pounds in delays. The firm also said it was considering stockpiling billions of pounds of parts to prepare for Brexit disruption.

Quick Guide Airbus – the background Show What is Airbus?

Airbus traces its roots back to 1967, when ministers from France, Germany and Britain agreed to jointly establish a European programme of aircraft development and production to take on the dominance of America. ​In 1969 a small group of engineers, who became known as the fathers of Airbus, were charged with getting the A300 plane off the ground. It was the first aircraft produced by Airbus Industrie, and​ the first A300 plane flew in 1972, with Air France the first customer. In 2012, when the company was called EADS, Angela Merkel vetoed an attempted merger with British defence firm BAE Systems. She was concerned about German jobs , but was also thought to be fundamentally opposed to the Franco-German firm merging with BAE. Less than a year later, EADS rebranded as Airbus with three divisions - commercial planes; defence and space; and military and civilian helicopters. Where is it based?

The company’s main base is Toulouse, France, and its German chief executive Tom Enders has led the company since 2012. It employs about 130,000 people in 180 locations, primarily in France, Germany, the UK and Spain. What does it do in the UK?

It directly employs 14,000 across 25 sites, and supports a further 110,000 jobs. Its biggest base in the UK is at Broughton in north Wales, where the wings are assembled for all Airbus commercial aircraft, employing 6,000 people. What does Airbus make?

Its bestselling plane is the single-aisle A320 but it it also makes civil and military helicopters and ​operates in the space and defence sectors making ​military aircraft, such as the A400M and Eurofighter Typhoon. ​It is also involved in developing cyber security systems for governments and Earth observation systems . In the UK, customers range from easyJet to the Ministry of Defence. Other key customers include Emirates, which agreed in January to buy up to 36 more A380s – the double-decker superjumbos. Plans for China

China has become a major target for growth for Airbus​ in more recent years, as rapid growth in the aviation sector in the world’s second largest economy continues​. It established a base there in 1994, ​and ​delivered its 1,000th commercial jetliner in 2013, aiming to reach its 2,000th by 2020, which will push its market share above 50%. Chinese deliveries now account for nearly a quarter of the company’s global commercial aircraft production. Airbus could benefit from increasing trade tensions between China and the US, if Beijing decides to favour Airbus over its arch-rival - America’s Boeing. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

On BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Tom Williams, the chief operating officer of Airbus Commercial Aircraft, was asked if the company was planning to abandon its plans to build new wings in the UK. He replied: “We are seriously considering whether we should continue that development or we should find alternate solutions.”

Asked how many jobs were at risk, Williams pointed out that Airbus generates 100,000 jobs in the UK, including 14,000 directly employed by the company.

Williams repeatedly called on the government to provide more detail about trading arrangements under Brexit and said the lack clarity was forcing its hand.

He said: “Over the next weeks we need to get clarify. We are already beginning to press the button on our crisis actions ... We have got to be able to protect our employees, our customers and our shareholders and we can’t do that in the current situation.”

Asked if he was under political pressure from European governments that part-fund Airbus to sound the alarm, Williams said: “I’m an engineer not a politician I have to deal in certainty. And we need to have clarity. We can’t continue with the current vacuum in terms of clarity.”

Earlier, Williams said: “While Airbus understands that the political process must go on, as a responsible business we require immediate details on the pragmatic steps that should be taken to operate competitively.

“Without these, Airbus believes that the impacts on our UK operations could be significant. We have sought to highlight our concerns over the past 12 months, without success. Far from ”project fear”, this is a dawning reality for Airbus. Put simply, a no-deal scenario directly threatens Airbus’s future in the UK.”

In a risk assessment of the Brexit process published on Thursday, Airbus, which generates £1.7bn in UK tax revenues [pdf], gave a damning analysis of Britain leaving the EU without a deal. It said leaving the single market, and the customs union and the European court of justice would heavily disrupt its supply chain.

The risk assessment said operating under WTO rules could cost the company billions of pounds every week in loss of turnover and delay penalties. In the event of a no deal, the aerospace firm said it would be forced to reconsider its footprint in the UK, putting thousands of high-skilled jobs at risk.

In what the company called an “orderly” Brexit scenario with an agreement and transition period, the aerospace giant warned the current transition endpoint of December 2020 did not give the business enough time to reconfigure its supply chain and was likely to cause production disruption.

Darren Jones, the Labour MP whose Bristol North West constituency contains the Airbus Filton wing factory, attacked the government after Airbus’s statement.

Jones said: “Time and time again the government has been shown to listen only to hardline pro-Brexit MPs and not to the businesses that employ thousands of British workers, including Airbus. “Thousands of skilled, well-paid jobs are now on the line because of the shambolic mess the government have created over the Brexit negotiations.”

Thursday’s statement is not the first time Airbus has demanded further clarity on the Brexit process. In March, Katherine Bennett, the senior vice-president for Airbus in the UK, told the Today programme that a three-hour wait on a lorry at Dover “would be a critically bad issue for Airbus”, as would be delaying cargo flights carrying completed wings to Europe.

Bennett said: “It’s critical for our business to ensure that the wings that we build in Broughton and in Filton can get to France and Germany for the final assembly line.”



Bennett said Airbus spent about £5bn each year on the UK supply chain. “It’s really important that the parts don’t get held up in warehouses. We have a very just-in-time delivery system.”



She welcomed Theresa May’s intention for Britain to remain a member of EASA, the European air safety certification agency, warning that customs remained “pretty critical for us” and said that Airbus very soon would “have to press a button on a decision on stockpiling parts”.



She added: “It would be very expensive for us and a burden we don’t want to be suffering. Our key preference is for the UK to remain a home nation for Airbus. But we really need the conditions for us to be effective. We don’t want extra costs on our UK business which may make Airbus think differently about us.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999467670917511}",neutral,0.999467670917511,0

One of the capabilities highlighted at Eurosatory was Airbus’ hybrid networks, bringing seamless connectivity management services spanning disparate networks – whether digital or analogue; and deployed on the ground, in the air or in space.

Airbus’ solution provides collaboration between networks having their own characteristics, without the need to create a new network. The company’s offer addresses a wide range of users’ requirements, including government customers (defence and public safety) as well as commercial operators (large corporations and critical infrastructure).

Key features of Airbus hybrid networks include intelligent tactical routing, authentication that ensures end-to-end security, and the adaptability to such new technologies as SDN (software defined networking) and NFV (network function virtualisation).

Augmented decision-making

The Eurosatory exhibition also provided the venue for Airbus’ display of its augmented decision-making capabilities with the innovative “Holographic Tactical Sandbox.” Using augmented reality technology and high-resolution 3D imagery to create a holographic map, the “Holographic Tactical Sandbox” creates a highly accurate representation of the battlefield that is viewable via augmented reality helmets.

This decision-making tool provides real-time shared situational awareness and enhanced mission effectiveness, enabling operators to view information and create situations for mission preparation, mission briefings and rehearsals – which then can be shared with higher decision-making levels of command.

The “Holographic Tactical Sandbox” is interoperable with Airbus’ Fortion® TacticalC2 tactical battle management software – a single software solution for use throughout the command chain with automatic data synchronisation.

A greater focus on connectivity

The connectivity theme at Eurosatory extended as well to Airbus’ agile imagery capabilities. It brings “space-eye” views from Airbus-built smart constellations of radar and optical satellites together with real-time video and information using the company’s Zephyr high altitude pseudo-satellite (HAPS), as well as images from enduring drones at high, medium and low altitudes (illustrated at Eurosatory by the ALIACA and DVF 2000 ER unmanned aerial vehicles from Airbus’ Survey Copter subsidiary, and the VSR 700 rotary-wing system developed for naval applications based on Airbus helicopter expertise).","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8006004095077515}",positive,0.8006004095077515,1

Together with the helicopters, Airbus will provide an extensive training and support package.

“We are honoured to be of service – once more – to the Hungarian Ministry of Defence whom we today welcome as a new customer for our H145M helicopters. With this new order, we are fostering our excellent and trustful relationship with the Hungarian Armed Forces after their acquisition of two A319 military troop transporters last year. Team Airbus is grateful for the continued trust and confidence that the Hungarian government has placed in our products”, said Tom Enders, Chief Executive Officer of Airbus.

With a maximum take-off weight of 3.7 tonnes, the H145M can be used for a wide range of tasks, including troop transport, utility, surveillance, air rescue, armed reconnaissance and medical evacuation. The Hungarian fleet will be equipped with a fast roping system, highperformance camera, fire support equipment, ballistic protection as well as an electronic countermeasures system to support the most demanding operational requirements. The HForce system, developed by Airbus Helicopters, will allow Hungary to equip and operate their aircraft with a large set of ballistic or guided air-to-ground and air-to-air weapons.

The H145M is a tried-and-tested light twin-engine helicopter that was first delivered in 2015 to the German Armed Forces and has since been ordered by Thailand and the Republic of Serbia. The programme’s maturity allows Airbus Helicopters to execute orders on cost and on schedule. Mission readiness of the H145Ms already in service is above 95 percent.

Powered by two Safran Arriel 2E engines, the H145M is equipped with full authority digital engine control (FADEC).

According to FlightAware's tracking data, Flight 12, bound for Sydney, took off from LAX just 71 seconds before Flight 94.

Wake turbulence is described as the vortices (a mass of whirling air) generated by the plane's wings as it flies through the air. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, these vortices emanate from the wingtips and tend to descend as it trails the aircraft.

""We understand that any sudden turbulence can be a jolt for passengers but aircraft are designed to handle it safely,"" Qantas Fleet Safety Captain Debbie Slade said in a statement to Business Insider. ""As the Captain explained to passengers at the time, this A380 experienced a short burst of wake turbulence from another A380 flying ahead and above it.""

Though there are safety guards in place to reduce the likelihood of wake turbulence, there's no surefire way to prevent it. That's why airlines tell passengers to always keep their seat belts fastened during a flight, Slade explained.

Airbus has opened the company’s Space Academy in Toulouse, France to help train customers in the operation of satellites and space systems that are acquired from the company.



When a spacecraft or system is purchased from Airbus, the future operator requires training – particularly for such first-time customers as governments establishing their initial space programmes, explained Héloïse Scheer, the Customer Training Manager for Space Systems.

Such preparation typically involves 3-6 months of theoretical training and an equivalent amount of practical operational training. ""We have some customers with us for up to 12 months,” Scheer said.

Airbus customers, who can spend up to a year training on satellite operations, will benefit from the resources at the Space Academy in Toulouse, France

Becoming a recognised leader in customer training

The 500 square metre Space Academy, inaugurated on 29 May, strikes a balance between operational efficiency and comfort, stated Scheer. Feedback from the Academy’s first customers already has been positive and “it’s the little considerations that have received the most praise,” she added.



Scheer noted that Airbus is establishing itself as a recognised leader in customer training with the attention paid to customers’ needs at the Space Academy and the company’s continuing work to digitise all aspects of training. “The Space Academy building is an important step.”

The new Space Academy has a surface area of approximately 500 square meters and is located on Airbus Toulouse' space campus in an area fully dedicated to customers.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.5926451086997986}",positive,0.5926451086997986,1

A Lufthansa Airbus A340 was damaged after a fire broke out on a truck towing the widebody jet at Germany's Frankfurt Airport on Monday.

Ten airport workers, including ground crew and emergency responders, suffered smoke inhalation injuries that The Associated Press described as “minor.”

Lufthansa said it was not clear what led to the blaze. Images showed significant burn marks around the flight deck and front of the A340. The A340 was painted in a special Star Alliance livery.

“The aircraft is heavily damaged,” Lufthansa said in a statement to Reuters, adding to the news agency that the aircraft had been scheduled to used Monday for Lufthansa Flight 426 from Frankfurt to Philadelphia.

AP notes “the fire sent black smoke billowing into the air but airport traffic was not affected by the incident.”

Bloomberg News adds that “the aircraft, registered as D-AIFA, is named after the German city of Dorsten. The plane was delivered in 2000, making it more likely to be scrapped than repaired.”","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9876065850257874}",negative,0.9876065850257874,-1

· Key enabler in Airbus’ single-aisle ramp-up

Airbus has inaugurated the fourth Hamburg, Germany A320 Family production line. Making use of digital technologies and a more flexible industrial setup, the innovative state-of-the-art line is a key enabler for ramping up the single-aisle programme to 60 aircraft per month by mid-2019.



Frank Horch, Hamburg’s Senator of Economy, Transport and Innovation and Thomas Jarzombek, Federal Government Coordinator of German Aerospace Policy, witnessed the milestone together with Guillaume Faury, President Airbus Commercial Aircraft, and 500 distinguished guests at a special ceremony in Hamburg.

“The inauguration of our latest, most modern A320 production line opens a new chapter in efficient, digital aircraft manufacturing,” said Guillaume Faury. “With these new technologies we are building our aircraft more efficiently, a key enabler for higher production rates. I would like to thank the teams who pushed this newest Airbus production standard from concept to reality.”

With more than 14,000 A320ceo and A320neo Family aircraft ordered and over 8,100 delivered, the A320 is the world’s most successful single-aisle aircraft family. Incorporating the latest state-of-the-art technologies including new-generation engines and Sharklets, the A320neo Family provides 15 percent fuel savings at delivery and 20 percent by 2020. To date, the A320neo Family has captured nearly a 60 percent market share with more than 6,000 orders from 100 customers.

The A320 Family aircraft are manufactured globally, at Airbus sites in Europe, China and the US. In addition to the new production line, Airbus also inaugurated a larger and modernised Hamburg A320 Family delivery centre with more customer areas, more efficient delivery processes and increased hospitality services.

Background information

The line features two seven-axis robots for automated fuselage drilling. These robots are able to drill almost 80 percent of holes on the upper side of the sections, which improves the ergonomic working environment. The robots also drill with higher accuracy to ensure a constant level of production quality resulting in less rework. Furthermore, the new line features an innovative layout and the use of mobile tooling platforms that navigate autonomously with laser trackers.

The new technologies and processes applied in the new line were designed and implemented in close coordination with employees and following the principle of Design Thinking. This resulted in a modern and much more efficient working environment with an optimised provisioning of all required materials at the work stations within a range of three metres, shorter walking distances and already unpacked components ready to mount. Many of the new technologies and processes will be transferred to other Airbus production lines worldwide.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999847412109375}",positive,0.9999847412109375,1

Multi-mission flexible satellite, SES-12 is the third Airbus all-electric satellite in orbit

Toulouse, 04/06/2018 - SES-12, the 13th satellite built by Airbus for SES, has been successfully launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on 04 June. Following separation from the launcher, the most powerful all-electric satellite ever has completed its initialization phase and has started its electric orbit raising (EOR) operations as planned.



SES-12 is the third all-electric satellite built by Airbus in orbit. Its communications payload incorporates state-of-the-art solutions, in particular multi-beam antennas linked to a digital signal processor, which enable a multitude of basic spectral channels to be allocated to various beams in a completely flexible manner.

“Airbus salutes SES’ ambitions regarding innovation and responsiveness in a rapidly changing market and we acknowledge their strong support for all-electric satellite technology”, said Nicolas Chamussy, Head of Space Systems. “We have been using electric propulsion for station-keeping for more than a decade and have now in orbit three Eurostar E3000 satellites equipped with the EOR technology. The Airbus team has now started SES-12 Electric Orbit Raising (EOR) operations.”

The mass saving by using all-electric EOR technology enables SES-12 to combine two high-capacity missions, equivalent to two conventional payloads, in one spacecraft. To fulfil its dual mission, SES-12 features both wide beams and high throughput spot beams to serve diverse connectivity needs. The satellite will provide expansion and replacement capacity to serve the fixed data, mobility, government and video sectors in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions.

SES-12 will operate in the Ku and Ka-bands with a total of 76 active transponders and eight antennas. Weighing 5,400 kg at launch it has an electrical power of 19 kW and will operate in geostationary orbit at the 95° East location for a planned service period of more than 15 years.

ESA’s Aeolus will provide measurements on a daily basis in near real-time to improve the accuracy of weather forecasts

ESA’s spacecraft Aeolus, built by Airbus is now ready for launch

Toulouse, 05/06/2018 - Aeolus, the European Space Agency’s wind sensing satellite, is now ready for its upcoming launch. It will be shipped across the Atlantic on the Airbus vessel “Ciudad de Cádiz"" to Kourou, French Guiana, where a Vega launcher will send it to orbit on 21 August. The instrument is so sensitive that it could be damaged by a sudden loss of pressure. For this reason, air transportation has to be avoided and for the first time Airbus will transport one of its satellites on-board its own vessel.

The 1.33-tonne spacecraft, primed by Airbus, features the first ever space-borne LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) instrument called Aladin, which uses the Doppler effect to determine the wind speed at varying altitudes.

Aladin fires a powerful ultraviolet laser pulse down through the atmosphere and collects backscattered light, using a large 1.5m diameter telescope, which is then analysed on-board by highly sensitive receivers to determine the Doppler shift of the signal from layers at different heights in the atmosphere.

“Aeolus is a world first with break-through technology that will make a huge contribution to weather forecasting on a global scale. Pioneering a LIDAR instrument in Space is quite a challenge – but a great example of what Europeans can achieve when we work together!”, said Nicolas Chamussy, Head of Space Systems at Airbus.

The data from Aeolus will provide reliable wind-profile data on a global scale and is needed by meteorologists to further improve the accuracy of weather forecasts and by climatologists to better understand the global dynamics of Earth’s atmosphere.

Aeolus will orbit the Earth 15 times a day with data delivery to users within 120 minutes of the oldest measurement in each orbit. The orbit repeat cycle is 7 days (every 111 orbits) and the spacecraft will fly in a 320 km orbit for three years.

Aerial law enforcement: in service of their communities - Airbus,"Fri, 08 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE4LTA2LWFlcmlhbC1sYXctZW5mb3JjZW1lbnQtaW4tc2VydmljZS1vZi10aGVpci1jb21tdW5pdGllc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Among the H125, H135 and H145, around 810 helicopters are in service in law enforcement, contributing to Airbus’ nearly 60 percent share of the global law enforcement fleet over the last 10 years. Below, a look at the airborne police units of Las Vegas, Japan and Germany, who are at the service of community and country in specially-equipped helicopters.

Up on the mountain



The helicopter’s shadow flits across the desert, where Joshua trees stand like old men over clumps of creosote. It’s still cool and snow lies in valleys on Mount Charleston. The crew of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department’s air unit, or Metro, point the nose of their H145 toward the area where a hiker has slipped and sustained injuries.

“We transfer from the scene to medical transport,” says Steve Morris, Jr., Metro chief pilot. “The medevac companies won’t go back in the canyons. And they don’t have a hoisting ability, so we’re called to transfer from the scene.”

The canyon where the hiker is waiting lies in shadow, its 90-foot walls V-shaped. The H145 hovers while the hoist operator lowers his crewmate to the canyon floor. Wind bends the trunks of junipers, their branches an obstacle for the orange-suited officer; he tugs the yellow rescue sling out of their way as he descends.

Las Vegas Metro operates six helicopters, deployed 80% of the time on patrols in support of ground officers. In August 2017, they became the US’s first police agency to take delivery of an H145, for mountain rescues. It’s also used for quick reaction force deployment, as during the 2017 Rock ’n Roll Marathon, where “we had it ready, staffed and staged,” says Morris. “We flew overwatch over the events with the team in the back ready to deploy.”

A few minutes pass, with everyone concentrated – the pilot on the instruments, the hoist operator’s gloved hand on the line to guide his crewmate in. The altimeter reads 9,047 feet mean sea level (MSL), with the H145’s twin engines maintaining a steady hover. The rescuer rises into view, supporting the hiker in the sling.

“The rescue at Mount Charleston was high,” says Morris. “We’ll get some higher-density altitude ones in the summer, when it’s over 112o F (44o C).”

Disaster relief-ready

In Japan, you’re as likely to see police officers paying a house call on an elderly resident, as see them chasing down a criminal. The country’s view of society and community defines the role of law enforcement in a number of ways. And far from the high-rise apartments, the country’s coastline requires a different sort of intervention, as police maintain a lookout for illegal trafficking and threats to national security.

The H135s are based in Hokkaido, Tokyo, Saitama, Osaka, Fukui, Kochi, Tokushima, Fukuoka and Miyazaki. Two more will enter service in 2018 in Kumamoto and Wakayama prefectures.

To meet the aerial needs of Japan's National Police Agency (NPA), around 80 small and medium helicopters are used, of which 10 H135s and 10 Dauphin H155s are seen patrolling, providing aerial support to ground forces, performing electronic surveillance or helping in disaster relief.

Operating above crowded cities – Tokyo’s 13.7 million people fit in 2,193 km2 (847 sq-miles) – presents challenges to law enforcement squads. In the nine prefectures where H135s are in use, sound issues are kept to a minimum—the Fenestron tail rotor doing the job of “keeping the peace” between police and residents.

The H135s are also used for commercial passenger transport.

Japan’s police also train extensively for disaster relief, critical to a region at the mercy of earthquakes and tsunamis. Domestically, the NPA is tasked for natural disaster response—the 2011 East Japan earthquake and tsunami are a recent example.

In 2018, two new H135s will enter service in Kumamoto and Wakayama prefectures, loaded with equipment for a variety of missions. A radio for traffic control, a GPS system, a hoist and fast-rappelling system, and a host of cockpit features designed to enhance the aircraft’s flight safety will aid officers as they “protect life, person, and property.”

In Japan, you’re as likely to see police officers paying a house call on an elderly resident, as see them chasing down a criminal.

The new H135s, which will arrive in 2018, will be equipped with Helionix avionics.

Community policing



Flying low over the historic centre of Stuttgart, Germany, the police of Baden-Württemberg have set off in their H145 on a search for a missing person—a retirement home resident. Frost dusts the ground in Stuttgart’s gardens. The two pilots with systems operator, Christian Daxkobler, reach the area where the man is thought to be and begin scanning the bushes with an electro-optical system. “The thermal imaging camera allows us to spot details we simply couldn’t see with the naked eye,” says Daxkobler. “And even if someone is partially obscured by branches and leaves, we can still detect them by their heat signature.”

Seated in the H145’s rear cabin at a station with a 22-inch screen, Daxkobler – who’s been with the unit for four-and-a-half years – can analyse the images in real time while relaying them to the police dispatch and patrol cars. The H145 has an image-stabilised, high-definition camera. Used with the searchlight, the crew members are able to build a complete picture.

“We’ve seen an increase in these sorts of callouts in recent years,” says Martin Landgraf, deputy chief of Baden-Württemberg’s police helicopter unit. “The H145 is a state-of-the-art police helicopter we can use to support our colleagues on the ground.”

Last year, we successfully located 62 missing people, all still alive, but people who might well have died without the help of our police helicopter unit.

- Martin Landgraf, deputy chief of Baden-Württemberg’s police helicopter unit

Since 2016, Baden-Württemberg’s police helicopter unit has been operating six H145 helicopters in Stuttgart and Söllingen, where 72 people are on call 24/7. In 2017, they flew over 2,600 missions, enforcing Germany’s concept that police should operate in close cooperation with the community.

In addition to searches for missing people, the unit undertakes flights for environmental protection, the documentation of severe accidents, manhunts, and surveillance. “Saving lives is our top priority,” says Landgraf. “Last year, we successfully located 62 missing people, all still alive, but people who might well have died without the help of our police helicopter unit.”

The H145s of the Baden-Württemberg police are versatile multi mission police helicopters.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999984502792358}",neutral,0.9999984502792358,0

The A330neo, Airbus’ newest widebody aircraft, has embarked on a worldwide tour to demonstrate its readiness for airline operations. As a final step in the aircraft certification phase, these function and reliability tests, also known as route proving, will include ETOPS (Extended-range Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards) missions, landing at diversion airports and testing airport handling services. After a fly-past over Airbus’ European sites, the A330neo will head for 15 major airports worldwide over five continents, aiming at achieving 150 flight test hours in three trips.

The route proving tests are performed with the first A330-900 production aircraft, fully equipped with an Airspace by Airbus cabin and flying in launch operator Tap Air Portugal’s colours. The aircraft first flew on 15 May 2018, launching flight tests to check cabin systems such as air conditioning.

The route proving tests form part of the final trials required for aircraft Type Certification scheduled for summer 2018.

Today, two A330-900 flight test aircraft and the TAP customer aircraft are involved in the intensive flight test programme, which will reach 1,000 flight hours during the tour of the Airbus plants.

Six miles away in Broughton, a town in north Wales on the border with England, there is a palpable fear that history could repeat itself.



On Friday morning, workers at the site of the aerospace firm Airbus were left in shock after notices went up on trade union boards on the factory floor informing them of the company’s warning that it could pull out of the UK.



The wing assembly factory in Flintshire employs about 6,000 mainly local people. Generations of the same family have walked through its doors. Therefore, for many, it is not just the loss of a job but of a way of life.

The company has its own football team nicknamed the Wingmakers who play in the Cymru Alliance League. There is a gym used by local people and plans in the pipeline for a new community centre. During the Broughton village carnival last week, Airbus sent apprentices to help out as well as sponsoring local charities and providing the float for the Rose Queen.

The warning in a detailed Brexit assessment by Airbus has brought back painful memories for some of the older community members. When the steelworks closed, many of the men never found work again; whole families were devastated.



Many Airbus workers now speak of a “fight for their future.” Derek Butler, a Flintshire town councillor who worked at the wing production plant for more than 20 years, described it as the “lifeblood” of the community.



He said: “This region was completely destroyed by the closure of the steelworks. We lived through some of the worst times; there was no work, it was totally and utterly devastating. It has taken a generation to bounce back from that. It is unimaginable what would happen if something similar were to happen again. I’m not sure we would survive a second time.”

At the factory gates, David Lawless, 34, was just clocking off the morning shift as a Beluga aircraft took off, heading for the company’s headquarters in Toulouse, France.

He said the news came as a shock and there had been a mixed reaction from his colleagues. “A lot of people are brushing it off and saying it won’t happen, it’s just talk, but the reality is companies are folding before Brexit has even happened. I don’t know what is going to happen here,” said Lawless. “We just need to try and stick together and hope that the government will fight for us.”

Lawless voted leave in the EU referendum but said he did not regret his decision.“I was in two minds. I wanted to leave but obviously a lot of people were asking questions before about if we were to leave, how it would affect us,” he said.

“People were saying it would never affect us here because it’s too big a company. I’m still happy I voted for it but I thought we had more of a hold and a footing here in Broughton.”

Meanwhile, Peter Sinnott, 55, who has worked at the site since 1980, said workers had been expecting the news since the Brexit vote. “Once we had a border (with Europe), it was always going to happen,” he said.

“Mr [Nigel] Farage knew the vote wouldn’t affect him either way. It’s every common man it affects. There are young men in there, lads with families and mortgages. It is them who this will affect the most.”

Speaking outside the factory on Friday, Darren Reynolds, the site convener for Unite the Union, said: “This site here employs 6,500 people. It’s key to this area and the north-west to have the jobs that we do. You tell them about the infrastructure of the supply chain and everything around what we do – that comes out of the Broughton plant. However, they’re not giving any answers.”



Reynolds said he had visited Downing Street twice this year to discuss the impact of Brexit with ministers but was not sure they understood the concerns.



For father-of-one Kevin Mullens, the news has been terrifying. Mullens’ father Billy retired from the plant last month aged 62. But Kevin, 34, continues to work there and cannot bear to think about a future without the security it offers.



“I have a one-year-old toddler and this is my livelihood. I have known nothing else since doing my apprenticeship and I have invested my life in the place. It couldn’t get any worse if the factory were to start making redundancies. We would not know what to do.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9990888833999634}",neutral,0.9990888833999634,0

These five H135s join 14 others from the H135 family, which have been in service for training at the Bundeswehr since 2000, where they have accumulated more than 100,000 flight hours.

The lightweight twin-engine H135 is used by military forces worldwide to train their personnel. Among others, armed forces from Great Britain, Switzerland, Portugal and Australia put their trust in the H135 family for this mission. In total, more than 1,300 helicopters from the H135 family have been delivered to customers worldwide, clocking up more than 4.5 million flight hours.

In addition to training, the H135 performs a wide range of missions including Emergency Medical Services (EMS), law enforcement, corporate transport and maintenance of offshore wind farms.

The first production A330neo, slated for delivery to TAP, will venture to 15 cities on 5 continents over the next few weeks.

Airbus kicked off this phase of the flight test campaign by conducting flypasts of various production facilities in Europe that have contributed components to the aircraft.

The aircraft then visited Lisbon for a brief stop and a party before setting off on the first intercontinental flight to Rio de Janeiro. Over the next few weeks the A330neo will travel to additional cities in South America and North America before heading to Africa, Asia, and back to North America to conclude the tour. Airbus hopes to accomplish 150 flight test hours during the tour.

The government signed a letter of intent with executives from both companies to test air taxis in and around the Bavarian city, Bloomberg reports. The trial is designed to counter congestion on the roads of Germany's cities and to give a boost to its tech industry.

""Flying taxis aren't a vision any longer, they can take us off into a new dimension of mobility,"" German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer said in a statement. ""They're a huge opportunity for companies and young startups that already develop this technology very concretely and successfully.""

The H160 can fly 170 mph and has a range of about 530 miles.

The prototype also has been tested in Lake Havasu, Arizona, and will go to Leadville, Colorado, next.

Airbus also has stressed safety, performance and economic competitiveness with the aircraft.

FARMINGTON — France-based Airbus Helicopters is taking advantage of mid-altitude conditions and warm weather at the Four Corners Regional Airport to test a prototype H160 helicopter this week.

Experimental flight test engineer Nicolas Certain said one test the company is performing here involves mimicking engine failure. He said the test is necessary for the H160 to receive certification from both the Federal Aviation Administration and the European Aviation Safety Agency.

Airbus hopes to get the helicopter certified so that it can be on the market in 2019.

The H160 is described as a medium-size helicopter that seats one or two pilots and up to 12 passengers. It can cruise at speeds of approximately 170 mph and has a range of nearly 530 miles.

Experimental test pilot Olivier Gensse said the craft could have various uses, including military, commercial and emergency medical services.

Prior to visiting Farmington, the crew tested the H160 in the hot temperatures of Lake Havasu, Arizona. Its next stop will be Leadville, Colorado, where the crew will test its ability to fly at high altitude.

Gensse said the United States has testing locations that are more suitable for those tests than Europe.

“We have some conditions, but not such as we can find in the United States,” he said.

Gensee said the helicopter is designed to have the ability of lighter aircraft with the systems of heavier aircraft. He said the design also takes into account comfort, including reducing vibration and decreasing the glare from sunlight. The helicopter also sports large windows for passengers.

Airbus also has stressed safety, performance and economic competitiveness with the aircraft. The French company boasts that the H160 is both quieter and cleaner than similar aircraft. According to Airbus Helicopter's H160 infographic, the helicopter uses 15 percent less fuel than previous helicopter engines.

Gensse said it is designed to be simple to fly because most crashes are caused by human error.

Airbus has delivered a body blow to Brexit Britain. It won’t be the last - The Guardian,"Fri, 22 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9jb21tZW50aXNmcmVlLzIwMTgvanVuLzIyL2FpcmJ1cy1icmV4aXQtYnJpdGFpbi1jb21tb253ZWFsdGgtcGxhbmUtd2luZ3Mtbm9ydGgtd2FsZXPSAXBodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vY29tbWVudGlzZnJlZS8yMDE4L2p1bi8yMi9haXJidXMtYnJleGl0LWJyaXRhaW4tY29tbW9ud2VhbHRoLXBsYW5lLXdpbmdzLW5vcnRoLXdhbGVz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A few days ago, I wrote about how big businesses were no longer just frustrated with Theresa May and her Brexit bumblings. Instead, they were turning hostile. “Soon the headlines will be not just about a few hundred jobs moving out of the City – but of firms scrapping their expansion plans, or factories shifting to Poland, or thousands of jobs going at a stroke of a pen.”

Today’s announcement from Airbus is just the first of those body blows to the British economy. The aeroplane-making giant has said in public what it has been telling ministers and officials in private for months: if May’s government crashes out of the EU without a deal, it will be forced to “reconsider its footprint in the country, its investments in the UK and its dependency on the UK”. Even an “orderly” Brexit, with all ducks in a carefully negotiated row, will cost the multinational billions in red tape and slower operations.

“Until we know and understand the new [post-Brexit] relationship,” concludes the company’s internal risk assessment , “Airbus should carefully monitor any new investments in the UK and should refrain from extending its UK suppliers/partners base.” Make no mistake: a multinational is now showing Brexit Britain and its shambles of a government the red card. And it will not be the last.

The significance of this is hard to overstate. Airbus directly employs 14,000 people in Britain; its supply chain supports a further 110,000 jobs here. In a country beset by low pay and low productivity, this sector is the opposite: highly skilled, highly paid, and with productivity growth of around 4% a year (compared with only 1% in the wider economy).

At Broughton in north Wales, they’ve been making planes since world war two. Under Airbus, that plant teems with 6,000 staff, in an area that 40 years ago was pretty much stripped of its steel industry. If it loses that giant factory, the local economy will be back on the floor for decades.

Some will doubtless point out the irony of the leave voters of north Wales now paying for their votes with their jobs. That is to ignore how many Airbus workers will be commuting into Broughton from around Liverpool. The potential ripples of this will spread far and wide, and they will last.

After Margaret Thatcher delivered the mortal blow to British industry in the 1980s, she devastated those communities – and helped sow the seeds of the Brexit vote of 2016. We are once again back at the stage where decisions made in smart offices by company executives threaten economic and social collapse in areas that can still remember their last great economic disaster – and once again the political consequences are likely to remain with us for a long time to come.

Of course, the government knows all this, because it produced an analysis of Brexit’s impact on aerospace as one of its 39 secret reports. These were the ones that were only made public after weeks of wrangling and published just days before Christmas.

I went back this morning and looked at what clues the report contained for the fallout for Britain’s aviation industry. Aircraft, it solemnly declares, have “nose, fuselage, wings … and tail”. I looked up mention of Airbus. Like Boeing, the report says, Airbus has “the capability to design and manufacture large, civil passenger aircraft”. In other words, the aeroplane-maker makes planes. And so it rambles on for 19 pages. To call it a Wikipedia rip-off would be too kind, since the online encyclopedia costs the taxpayer nothing. Yet it’s what you might expect from a government that has always treated Brexit as more a matter of internal party discipline and less a real-world event with an actual hard deadline.

This is not purely a Brexit story. It is also a reflection of the weakness of Britain’s economic model.

What the Airbus story reveals again is that our political classes – from Holyrood to Westminster to Cardiff Bay – have made themselves supplicants for foreign investment. The result is that among all the 28 members of the EU, the UK comes second only to Ireland in its reliance on foreign-direct investment. Just like Dublin and its sweetheart deals for the likes of Apple, we have bribed our way into that position.

Even while George Osborne was hacking back benefits for the working poor, he also brought down corporation tax to among the lowest in the world. The rationale was that this would make Britain more “competitive” and boost investment. Yet that policy was described this morning by his former adviser Lord Jim O’Neill as a comprehensive failure: “Investment spending has been very weak absolutely and relatively to many other countries. Despite this remarkable drop in ongoing corporation tax and rising profitability … it’s not done the job it’s supposed to do.”

Not only that, we have handed billions to companies in order to get them to set up base here. Look at the Corporate Welfare Watch database, set up by Kevin Farnsworth at the University of York, and you can see that the Welsh government handed Airbus nearly £15m in direct grants between 2004 and 2007.

Like Mexico, we are effectively a branch-plant economy for the rest of the world: we import components from other countries, then ships off parts to the continent or China or the US for them to be made into whole products. Trade secretary Liam Fox can jaw on about striking new trade deals, but he’ll be waiting a long time to find a buyer in Wellington or Canberra for the plane wings made in Broughton. And Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour can fret over not hurting the feelings of its leave-voting constituents, but it would be better off developing an industrial strategy that privileged local businesses and the everyday economy.

Brexit Britain is a precarious business model coupled with throwback fantasies about buccaneering our way around the Commonwealth. It makes us easy prey for the likes of Airbus, which although profitable in this country has been exploring its options in Korea and elsewhere for a long time. Why would a European plane-maker cut jobs in France or Germany when it needs EU support against Donald Trump and Boeing? Far easier to cut back in Britain, with its cabinet at war, its economy drifting away from the European mainland, and its jar of corporate sweeties already heavily raided. In lots of other industries, lots of other companies will soon be arriving at the same conclusion.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9978766441345215}",neutral,0.9978766441345215,0

Premier welcomes Airbus announcement to establish innovative Zephyr solar-powered unmanned aircraft at Wyndham airfield in Western Australia

Wyndham will be the world’s first operational site for the launch and recovery of the class of unmanned aircraft known as High Altitude Pseudo Satellites

Announcement follows Premier’s March meeting with Airbus executives in the UK

Project promises to create new jobs during its construction and operational phases

Premier Mark McGowan has welcomed today’s Airbus announcement to establish the innovative Zephyr solar-powered unmanned aircraft at Wyndham airfield in Western Australia.

The McGowan Government has been working with Airbus since February this year to support the implementation of Airbus Defence and Space’s High Altitude Pseudo Satellites (HAPS) program to establish the site development at Wyndham Airport.

In March, the Premier and Defence Issues Minister Paul Papalia visited Airbus at Farnborough, while in the United Kingdom, to be briefed on the Airbus proposal and provide State Government support.

The Zephyr HAPS project is a solar-powered aerial platform that flies at more than 65,000 feet to provide a range of earth observation services and communications connectivity for people in remote areas, including for civil, military or humanitarian purposes.

Airbus will begin flights in the second half of this year.

The choice of Wyndham due to the largely unrestricted airspace and reliable weather, together with the strong support provided by the Western Australian Government, provides both a job creation opportunity in the east Kimberley and a technology advancement opportunity for Western Australia, and Australia, more generally.

The State Government has been coordinating support for the Zephyr project, including with the Shire of Wyndham East Kimberley and the Kimberley Development Commission, to ensure that all arrangements are in place to support the operational start of the project at Wyndham.

“This is a major coup for Western Australia; I’m thrilled that Airbus has chosen Wyndham Airport as the operational and launch site for the Zephyr project.

“Our local economy will benefit from this decision, with up to 20 Airbus staff also earmarked to be based in the local area during operational phases. I am optimistic that early success of the project will lead to expanded job opportunities in the east Kimberley and elsewhere in Western Australia.

“From my meeting with the company in March, I was very impressed with the proposal and Airbus’ international reputation. The technically advanced nature of the project will also help build Western Australia’s profile in the aerospace, defence and innovation spaces.

“The Government looks forward to the operational success of Zephyr and to exploration by both local and other Australian government agencies and companies of opportunities to utilise such HAPS technology to improve economic, social and environmental outcomes in our region.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9996277093887329}",positive,0.9996277093887329,1

But, the flying taxi may not be a concept for long.

The German government signed a letter of intent to test the flying taxi in Ingolstadt, Audi's hometown, according to an Engadget report. The Pop.Up Next concept combines a traditional car and a flying taxi of sorts in one machine. On the ground, it will go 31 miles on an electric charge, but when airborne, it will go 81 miles.

Pop.Up Next concept

Audi, Airbus, and Italdesign have a rather large group of individuals working on the project spanning a handful of backgrounds. They include municipalities, urban planners, and even sociologists.

Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer said the mobility solution is a ""new dimension of mobility"" and creates a ""huge opportunity"" for companies to test flying taxi technology.

Pop.Up Next concept

The German government did not indicate when it plans to actually test the flying taxi, but the timeline will likely reflect Audi, Airbus, and Italdesign's progress. At the Pop.Up Next's debut, none of the companies involved said when prototypes would be ready, let alone did they share a production date. And the concept poses many unique challenges with safety. Car and flight modules require very different operating and safety systems, and if the concept is ever to take off, it needs to operate in both transportation methods seamlessly.

Audi is one of numerous companies vying for a chance to bring a flying taxi to market. Notable competitors include Uber, Lilium, and Volocopter.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999455213546753}",neutral,0.9999455213546753,0

Dominating he Airbus Helicopter stand at Eurosatory was a model of the H160M multi-role helicopter that has been selected for the French Light Joint-Sevice Helicopter (HIL) programme.

Being developed from the civil medium twin helicopter, the H160 developed from the X4 technology demonstrator, three of which are involved in a flight test programme, the H160M will replace no less than seven types currently in service with the Armée de Terre, the Armée de l’Air and the Aéronavale.

The 6-ton H160M will replace the Armée de Terre’s fleets of AS555 Fennecs and SA342 Gazelles in the armed scout role, equipped with undernose EO/IR sensor turret and armed with a 20mm cannon and Thales FZ275 laser-guided rockets mounted on stub wings, and 7.62mm door guns. They will also be equipped for fast roping.

The Armée l’Air’s Fennecs and SA330 Pumas will be replaced by the H160M in the ISR, close support, CSAR and anti-helicopter/UAV roles, some of which will be armed with cannon and door guns. All will be inflight refuellable from C-130J and A400M tanker aircraft.

In Aéronavale service the H160M will replace the AS365 Dauphins, AS565 Panthers and the recently retired SA314 Alouette IIIs.

For the naval SAR and sea surveillance roles the H160M will equipped with a maritime radar, armed with ANL next-generation light anti-surface missiles, and sonar and homing torpedoes for the Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) and Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW) roles. They will also work with UAVs such as the Airbus VSR700 in manned-unmanned (MUM) operations. They will all have folding rotor blades and tail fin, and deck-landing harpoon.

Although there is an initial requirement for 169 H160M helicopters in the three variants of the HIL programme, no contract has yet been signed for their production.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999951124191284}",neutral,0.9999951124191284,0

The H160 serves as a replacement for the H155, which is a facelifted version of the iconic AS365 Dauphin.

According to Airbus, the H160 features technology that required 68 new patents.

Airbus expects to deliver its first European certified H160 around the end of 2019 with US spec version to arrive six to eight months later.

In 2014, Airbus retired its long-running Eurocopter brand and reorganized its vertical take-off and landing division into Airbus Helicopters.

And the first ""purely Airbus"" creation to emerge since the rebranding is the Airbus H160. It's the company's newest entrant into the medium-sized twin-engine helicopter market.

""The H160 is coming into one of the most needed segments for us,"" Airbus Helicopters Inc. CEO Chris Emerson told Business Insider. ""It's a replacement for the current H155 and is able to scale up to the bottom end of the larger H175.""

The H160 is able to deliver vastly superior performance to the similarly sized, but older, H155. At the same time, it slots in below the much larger H175 that was designed to deliver speed and capacity for the company's oil and gas customers, Emerson, who is the head of Airbus Helicopter's North American business, said.

""This medium twin segment is heavily competitive,"" Emerson added.

After all, there are legacy aircraft like the AgustaWestland AW139, the Sikorsky S76, and the legendary Bell 412 with which to contend.

However, the H160 is expected to be a step above its rivals in the segment. To create the new helicopter, Airbus incorporated technology from 68 new patents while reimagining its production process with input from the automotive industry.

Recently, Business Insider had the opportunity to get check out an H160 prototype in person during a North American customer demo tour Airbus held for the helicopter.

Thailand’s space agency GISTDA confirmed that the deal took place on 15 June 2018, at the Mandarin Oriental in Bangkok, in the presence of Deputy Prime Minister Somkid Jatusripitak, Minister of Science and Technology Dr. Suvit Maesincee, and Airbus’ CEO Thomas Enders.

Theos-2, which will be Thailand’s second earth observation satellite, was approved by the Thai cabinet in March 2017. According to the cabinet reports last year, the Thai government will be investing a total of 7,800 million THB (approximately US$238 million) into Theos-2, in hopes that it will reform and develop space-related industries in Thailand.

Although no details of the satellite have been revealed except that it will have a design life of 5 years, GISTDA has outlined a space technology plan which mentions an earth observation satellite with a maximum resolution of 50cm. GISTDA has also identified six areas that Theos-2 will be purposed for, in accordance with the cabinet decisions – water management, disaster management, national security, monitoring pollution and natural hazards, as well as urban and economic development.

In addition to Theos-2, Thailand hopes to develop an indigenous 100-kg satellite. So far, Thailand has developed two cubesats – university research satellite KNACKSAT and amateur radio JAISAT-1, both of which will be launched this year.

Theos, which Theos-2 will replace, was launched in 2008 on a Dnepr launcher. Part of a bilateral agreement with France, Theos was developed at EADS Astrium, which is now part of Airbus Defence and Space. The satellite had a liftoff mass of 750kg, and was launched into a Sun-Synchronous Orbit, from where it captured 2-m panchromatic and 15-m multispectral imagery.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999942779541016}",neutral,0.9999942779541016,0

REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer

HAMBURG (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus inaugurated a new production line for its best-selling A320 jet with robots Luise and Renate joining human workers as it turns to new automation to help it deal with an eight-year order backlog.

Airbus hopes digital technology will enable higher production and trigger a significant shift in research and development spending toward high-tech manufacturing.

The planemaker is ramping up production of the single-aisle A320 jet, which competes with Boeing's 737, from 50 to 60 planes per month. Airbus has sold 8,000 of the jets with another 6,000 on order.

The new final assembly line in Hamburg, like other lines, has a top rate of 10 aircraft per month, which it will reach by mid-2019.

The two robots, whose names were chosen by employees, will in particular help to drill over 2,000 holes to join the two halves of the fuselage together, work normally done by humans.

They form part of a new final assembly line where the fuselage and wings are transported by automated moving tooling platforms, rather than being lowered by cranes onto fixed jigs, and where dynamic laser tracking is used to perfectly align aircraft parts.

The savings from the new technologies are not about time, but about precision and ergonomics, Airbus staff said.

""It's more efficient when you are not drilling all holes by hand,"" Klaus Roewe, head of the A320 family program, told reporters in Hamburg, saying that the other new technologies for maneuvering parts would help to reduce the likelihood of damage or errors.

Roewe said around one-third of the new technologies on the new final assembly line could potentially be transferred to other lines, whether in existing ones in Hamburg, France, China, or the United States.

""The priority is to ramp up and then we will start thinking about what we can transfer,"" he said.

Airbus has also extended and modernized its delivery center for the A320 family in Hamburg as part of plans to help it deal with the production ramp-up.

Airbus and Safran roll out major competitiveness boost to H125 and H130 - safran-group.com,"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhZnJhbi1ncm91cC5jb20vcHJlc3Nyb29tL2FpcmJ1cy1hbmQtc2FmcmFuLXJvbGwtb3V0LW1ham9yLWNvbXBldGl0aXZlbmVzcy1ib29zdC1oMTI1LWFuZC1oMTMwLTIwMTgtMDYtMjfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The two main improvements provided by Safran are the extension of 25 % the time between overhaul (TBO) to 5,000 hours for new and in-service helicopters, and the new three year/ 2,000 hours warranty conditions – replacing the previous two year/1,000 hours warranty – for all H125 and H130 helicopters delivered in 2018.

“Safran continuously works to make its engines more robust and easy-to-use”, says Nicolas Billecocq, Safran Helicopter Engines’ vice president of the Light Helicopter Engines Program. “Extensive endurance tests conducted on the Arriel 2D and analysis of engine fleet data have enabled us to further validate the engine’s strength and simplicity. Thanks to these new improvements, the Arriel 2D will feature one of the lowest direct maintenance costs of its class.”

“Improving customer satisfaction and the competitiveness of our products is one of our top priorities at Airbus Helicopters. These engine durability enhancements are a clear illustration of our efforts in this direction,” said Axel Aloccio, Head of the Light Helicopter Programme at Airbus Helicopters. “The TBO and warranty extension are very concrete improvements for H125 and H130 operators around the world: those two types keep offering the best value for money.”

H125 and H130 customers will also benefit from the removal of the calendar limitation, which until now required an engine inspection at a repair centre every 15 years, regardless of the number of hours logged.

The exceptional robustness of the Arriel 2D eliminates the need for a calendar limit on modules 1, 2, 4 and 5, while for module 3, the engine’s condition can be restored during a periodic visit performed at a maintenance centre.

The H125 and H130 lead the single-engine helicopter market, accounting for almost 70% of deliveries in the last five years. The H125 outclasses all other single-engines thanks to its performance in high and hot environments, versatility and low operating costs. The H130 is the quietest and safest helicopter in its class, having become the reference for passenger transport.

An Arriel-powered helicopter takes off every 15 seconds – all day, every day. In service since 2011 on Airbus’ H125 and H130, more than 1,000 Arriel 2D equipped H125 and H130 helicopters are in service worldwide, collectively logging more than one million flight hours. In service since 2011 on Airbus’ H125 and H130, the Arriel 2D offers extremely competitive operating costs, 10% lower in average than those of earlier variants.

The Arriel 2D is also backed by a complete Safran service package, notably the Support By the Hour (SBH®) contract and the 5Star programme, fully adapted to customers operating fewer than five helicopters.

The Arriel is the best-selling helicopter engine in its class. Over the past 40 years, over 12,000 units have been produced, together logging more than 50 million flight hours. With power outputs ranging from 650 to over 1,000 shp, the Arriel family now powers over 40 different helicopter types.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999518394470215}",positive,0.9999518394470215,1
Airbus A330neo to strut its stuff in global tour - Airline Ratings,"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzMwbmVvLXN0cnV0LXN0dWZmLWdsb2JhbC10b3VyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A330neo is embarking on a global tour as it enters the final phase of its certification program and the European manufacturer hopes airlines will show renewed interest as the aircraft struts its stuff.

The 23,000nm (43,000km) exercise, known as route proving, is using the first A330-900 production aircraft and will include (Extended-range Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards (ETOPS) ) missions, landing at diversion airports and testing airport handling services.

After a fly-past over Airbus’ European sites, the A330neo will head for 15 major airports worldwide over five continents as it aims for 150 flight test hours in three trips.

Destinations will include Chicago, Atlanta and Miami in the US, Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro in South America and Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong and Bangkok in Asia.

READ More airlines looking at ultra-long-range routes.

The aircraft, which first flew on May 15, will be kitted out with the manufacturer’s Airspace cabin and be flying in launch customer TAP Air Portugal’s colors. TAP is due to receive its first aircraft later this northern summer.

The route proving tests form part of the final trials required for aircraft Type Certification scheduled for summer 2018.

Two A330-900 flight test aircraft and the TAP customer aircraft are involved in the intensive flight test programme, which will reach 1,000 flight hours during the tour of the Airbus plants.

Launched in July 2014, Airbus has offered A330neo in two versions with 99 percent commonality, the A330-800 and A330-900.

However, the future of the A330-800 is in doubt after its sole customer, Hawaiian Airlines, canceled its order for six aircraft.

Airbus also lost a campaign to sell the A330neo to American Airlines after it was unwilling to match the price Boeing offered.

No new A330neo orders have been announced so far this year and the manufacturer announced in April it would trim total deliveries to 50 in 2019, compared to 67 in 2017.

The manufacturer has 214 firm orders for the A330-900 with AirAsia the biggest customer with 66 planes. The aircraft, powered by the Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engine, accommodates 287 seats in a standard three-class layout or up to 440 for high-density configurations. Airbus puts its range at 6550nm (12,130km).

A planned higher-weight version of the plane is expected to add another 650nm in range with reinforcements to the landing gear, wing and fuselage.

Airbus chief commercial officer Eric Schulz conceded on the sidelines of the recent International Air Transport Association conference in Sydney that the route proving was when the rubber hit the road.

“And so far we are extremely satisfied with the performance of the plane .. after the first phase of flight tests,” he said. “In terms of delivery, we are working very closely with TAP but we are within the last delivery dates we made public before so there is no change.

“If anything the program is doing quite well now.”

On the question of demand, Schulz acknowledged Airbus had suffered two defeats in a row with Hawaiian and American and the losses were unfortunate.

“In this particular case, I am not particularly anxious about the future of the 330neo,” he said. “Just here over the last three days I’ve seen many, many customers very interested about the neo and we have deals in process.

“I am quite hopeful that we will continue to find our place in the market.”

Schulz said the North American market had also been difficult for the A330ceo and he would focus on other markets.

“I think when people will start to see what has been done with that airplane and the capability, the extra range it offers, the extra payload it offers when we reach higher max take-off gross weight, I think people will realize what a good solution it is,” he said.

NEW A320 PRODUCTION LINE LAUNCHED

The A330neo flight comes after Airbus inaugurated its fourth A320 family production line in Hamburg on June 14.

The manufacturer said the new production line used digital technologies and a more flexible set-up that will be a key to plans to boost single-aisle production to 60 aircraft per month.

Airbus manufactures the highly successful A320 in production sites in Europe, China and the US.

WATCH Wing clouds make for stunning video

Airlines have ordered more than 14,000 A320ceo and A320neo aircraft and Airbus has delivered 8100.

The more efficient A320neo, which promises 15 percent fuel savings at delivery and 20 percent by 2020, has captured a market share of almost 60 percent with more than 6000 orders from 100 customers.

But it has been plagued by issues with Pratt & Whitney’s geared turbofan engine and with some batches of the alternative CFM Leap-1A powerplant.

Airbus’ Schulz said the company was in consistent dialogue with the manufacturers.

“We are in discussions with both, we have recovery plans from both and I would say we are reassessing every day based on their deliveries where we stand.

“I think this gives us a challenging ride because for a period of time we ‘ve had less engines than we wanted but so far they are sticking to their recovery plan.”

Schulz said Airbus was still not “100 percent relaxed” and acknowledged there was a steep learning curve to get through.

“But so far they are delivering what they committed to so so far we can see that the system seems to work,” he said, noting that the technical understanding of the problems had progressed well.

Both Airbus and the manufacturers also faced the problem of ramping up capacity, he said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999977707862854}",neutral,0.999977707862854,0

SHUBENACADIE, NS, June 26, 2018 /CNW/ - Airbus has delivered four H125 helicopters to Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources (NSDNR), completing the province's air fleet renewal, following a competitive bid in 2016.

The aircraft will play an instrumental role in increasing service capacity for a wide range of NSDNR missions including search and rescue, forestry programs, wildlife and geological surveys, as well as firefighting. The H125's lifting power capacity, endurance and maneuverability make it the reference for the most rigorous hot and high missions and swing operations.

""The Airbus H125 helicopter is made for the extreme environmental conditions our team often operates under and provides us the level of performance and safety we require,"" said the Honourable Margaret Miller, Minister of Natural Resources, Nova Scotia. ""The addition of these new helicopters will assist our team in providing increased support for the vast resources of Nova Scotia, including the ability to access remote areas quickly, providing support during weather events and managing resources more efficiently.""

The Department of Natural Resources' mandate is to develop, manage, conserve and protect forest, mineral, parks and wildlife resources, in addition to the administration of the province's Crown land.

""The protection and management of Nova Scotia's natural resources is mission critical and the H125 is a workhorse that is up for this challenging task,"" said Romain Trapp, President of Airbus Helicopters Canada. ""We are extremely proud of our successful and lasting relationship with Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources and we thank them for once again entrusting Airbus Helicopters to support their operations.""

Customized specifically for NSDNR, the H125 fleet are equipped with a glass cockpit, floor window, high-visibility doors, cable cutters, cargo mirror and cargo pods. The H125 helicopter will also allow the NSDNR to double its water carrying capacity when fighting wildfires.

An emerging answer to emergency transport in Asia - Airbus,"Fri, 08 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE4LTA2LWFuLWVtZXJnaW5nLWFuc3dlci10by1lbWVyZ2VuY3ktdHJhbnNwb3J0LWluLWFzaWHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Helicopter emergency medical services are gaining momentum around the world, particularly in Asia, where a mix of airspace regulations, infrastructure, and funding created barriers to the sector’s growth. Several breakthroughs are opening the door to this critical industry.

Suffer an accident, get hurt while far from home . . . we all want our route to emergency care to be fast. In Asia, a variety of actors are working hard to make this the case. The need for helicopter EMS (HEMS) is there. In Europe and the US, an average of two helicopters per million people is considered adequate. . By this calculation China, with a population of 1.4 billion and just a handful of dedicated HEMS aircraft, could require 700 helicopters; India, with a slightly smaller population, is projected to require close to the same.

The regulation on low altitude air traffic in China is loosening. I believe the cooperation with Airbus Helicopters will benefit the people and allow us to save more lives.

- Chongyue Jia, Head of Air Medical Rescue Beijing 999

A shift towards acceptance

Several developments reflect the strides being made to meet this need. The Indian government adapted its airspace regulations in mid-2016 to allow the development of the HEMS market, which was the first time separate regulations were made for this market in the country. . It is an evolving effort – new recommendations were submitted most recently in January 2018 – and defines the requirements for equipment and avionics, the differing roles for twin and single engine aircraft, and operational concessions (whether a flight plan is needed, flight limitations at night, etc.).

In 2001, Japan’s EMS system began a shift toward a physician-driven approach with its Doctor-Heli programme. Doctor-Helis are EMS helicopters that enable doctors and nurses to fly to emergency sites quickly, catering to outlying areas and aging populations. The change was accompanied by investments in infrastructure, and training for crews and hospital staff. The programme now successfully serves more than 40 prefectures.

Since 2014, China has seen a relaxation of its military-controlled airspace. As a result, there has been a growth in helicopters being used for specialised segments. In 2014, Beijing 999 Emergency Rescue Centre (a Beijing Red Cross Foundation subsidiary) took delivery of an H135, in the process supplying China with its first HEMS-dedicated helicopter. “The regulation on low altitude air traffic in China is loosening. I believe the cooperation with Airbus Helicopters will benefit the people and allow us to save more lives.” says Chongyue Jia, Head of Air Medical Rescue Beijing 999.

The key challenge to develop our activity in EMS in Asia is to convince our operators of the viability of their business model.

A working business model

“The key challenge to develop our activity in EMS in Asia is to convince our operators of the viability of their business model,” says Pierre André, Airbus Helicopters Head of Sales Southeast Asia. Operators’ means of financing their business run the gamut, whether full government support is involved, as in Bhutan, or the cost is shared, as in Japan, where the annual 210 million-yen subsidy is borne 50:50 by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and by local government. Surf Life Saving Queensland has been providing SAR services on Australia’s coastline for 42 years, thanks to a mix of corporate and government funding; an Australian bank is their main sponsor.

In Thailand, Bangkok Helicopter Services Company Ltd (BHS) manages its cost of operation by contracting with Bangkok Hospital to provide HEMS services using two H145s. “BHS has increased its capital to cover the investments in our new fleet and equipment, based on our confidence of future prospects,” says Kirati Kraipasit, Managing Director of BHS, which covers Thailand as well as Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar.

BHS has increased its capital to cover the investments in our new fleet and equipment, based on our confidence of future prospects.

- Kirati Kraipasit, Managing Director of BHS

In India, Aviators Air Rescue funded by Air Medical Group Holding (AMGH), a US based company, introduced dedicated HEMS services in 2017 using three H130 helicopters. Turbo Aviation will follow-up with an H135 helicopter based in Hyderabad by the end of 2018. In 2019, the state of Maharashtra will also start operating HEMS missions with a brand new H145 helicopter. However, the policies adopted by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) in India are yet to be fully implemented. Support from state governments is essential in a country with 1.3 billion inhabitants and a need for more than 600 dedicated EMS helicopters.

Unique challenges

Asia’s HEMS operators face other challenges. For years, the operators in Nepal have been performing some of the most dangerous rescue missions in the world. Every day, a fleet of almost 25 H125 helicopters soars above 20,000 feet, each aircraft flying more than eight hours. Thousands of lives are rescued every year because of the ability of the pilots and engineers to perform such critical missions. Two H130s have been introduced by Royal Bhutan Helicopter Services (RBHS) in Bhutan to perform in a similar environment.

One of the challenges particular to Japan is its pool of experienced pilots: the 2,000 flight-hour minimum requirement for pilots has recently been moderated to 1,000 hours for captains in response. “Japan’s lack of younger pilots might affect the growth of this segment, since over two-thirds of EMS pilots are over 50 years old,” says Olivier Tiller, Managing Director of Airbus Helicopters Japan.

Several aircraft have been meeting the needs of these challenges. In Japan, where twin-engine aircraft are a prerequisite, Hirata Gakuen will be entering the country’s first H145 into service in Nagasaki prefecture in June 2018. In Nepal, the single-engine H125 serves almost 80% of the civil market, as one of the helicopters the most capable of reliable search and rescue performance at high altitudes. For Queensland’s coastal rescues, the H135 is an agile platform. “Our missions are far more dynamic than a typical winch rescue,” says Paul Gibson, Surf Life Saving Queensland chief pilot. “If we see someone in distress, we have to turn the H135 around quickly and be ready to effect an immediate winch.”

A region of firsts

Challenges notwithstanding, the region’s HEMS industry is gaining momentum. In Asia Pacific at the end of 2015, 202 helicopters flew dedicated EMS missions, triple the number just a decade earlier*. In Japan, some 20,000 HEMS missions were flown in 2013; by 2016, it had reached 25,000 and continues to grow.

Asian operators are stepping up to fill the gaps. BHS in Thailand has been operating medical flights since 2007 with an H145. Becoming the first operator in Southeast Asia to receive an EMS-configured H145 means BHS can perform night flights and those needing IFR clearance. “We expect to see our company placed in a more vital role of the healthcare business,” says Kraipasit.

In China, seeing its operations expand, Beijing 999 signed for an H145 in 2017 to complement its fleet of two H135s and one H145. The H145 is the first of its kind to be configured with a rescue hoist, which will be used for mountain rescues during the 2022 Olympics in Beijing. In Shandong province, China’s second-most populous province, HEMS999 (a subsidiary of MIT Group) operates six H130 helicopters against a growing need for highway accident EMS.

India’s first dedicated HEMS operations began in 2017 with Aviators Air Rescue, which has been operating three EMS-equipped H130s, and will shortly receive an H135. “A recent event highlighted the value of having helicopters for EMS missions,” says Arun Sharma, Managing Director, Aviators Air Rescue. “We got a call to move a heart from one hospital to another, an intercity flight, which was done for the first time in Bangalore. It took only seven minutes to move that heart from one place to another, while by ambulance it would have taken them an hour and a half in the city during peak hours.”

Paving the way for the future

Taking the sector’s growth into its own hands, China signed a framework agreement with Airbus Helicopters in 2016 to build an H135 final assembly line in Qingdao, for 100 H135s over ten years. “The potential for EMS in China is big,” says Marie-Agnès Veve, Head of North Asia region and managing director of Airbus Helicopters China. “We are developing the H135 with a Chinese partner in part to meet the needs of the HEMS segment.”

HEMS’ success in the coming years will rest on proof-of-concept, through the efforts of pioneers like Aviators, BHS, and Beijing 999; and on educating both authorities and the public on its viability.

HAMBURG (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus inaugurated a new production line for its best-selling A320 jet with robots Luise and Renate joining human workers as it turns to new automation to help it deal with an eight-year order backlog.

Airbus hopes digital technology will enable higher production and trigger a significant shift in research and development spending toward high-tech manufacturing.

The planemaker is ramping up production of the single-aisle A320 jet, which competes with Boeing's 737, from 50 to 60 planes per month. Airbus has sold 8,000 of the jets with another 6,000 on order.

The new final assembly line in Hamburg, like other lines, has a top rate of 10 aircraft per month, which it will reach by mid-2019.

Related stories

The two robots, whose names were chosen by employees, will in particular help to drill over 2,000 holes to join the two halves of the fuselage together, work normally done by humans.

They form part of a new final assembly line where the fuselage and wings are transported by automated moving tooling platforms, rather than being lowered by cranes onto fixed jigs, and where dynamic laser tracking is used to perfectly align aircraft parts.

The savings from the new technologies are not about time, but about precision and ergonomics, Airbus staff said.

""It's more efficient when you are not drilling all holes by hand,"" Klaus Roewe, head of the A320 family program, told reporters in Hamburg, saying that the other new technologies for maneuvering parts would help to reduce the likelihood of damage or errors.

Roewe said around one-third of the new technologies on the new final assembly line could potentially be transferred to other lines, whether in existing ones in Hamburg, France, China, or the United States.

""The priority is to ramp up and then we will start thinking about what we can transfer,"" he said.

Airbus has also extended and modernized its delivery center for the A320 family in Hamburg as part of plans to help it deal with the production ramp-up.

The first BelugaXL has passed the Ground Vibration Test (GVT), a requirement for certification of the aircraft that paves the way towards its maiden flight in summer 2018.



The objective of this test is to measure the dynamic behaviour of the aircraft and confirm theoretical models of various flight conditions, such as manoeuvring, flying in gusty conditions and landing. The test data also helps clear the aircraft’s flight envelope.

The GVT of the BelugaXL was performed by ONERA in collaboration with DLR over eight testing days using several hundreds of external accelerometers while the aircraft was stimulated by external shakers or seismic exciters.

The BelugaXL was launched in November 2014 to address the transport and ramp-up capacity requirements for Airbus beyond 2019. The new oversize air transporters are based on the A330-200 Freighter, with a large re-use of existing components and equipment. The first of five BelugaXLs will fly in summer 2018 and enter into service in 2019.

A Look At The Fair Value Of Airbus SE (EPA:AIR) - Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sb29rLWZhaXItdmFsdWUtYWlyYnVzLXNlLTExMTg0Nzk0OS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In this article I am going to calculate the intrinsic value of Airbus SE (EPA:AIR) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This is done using the Discounted Cash Flows (DCF) model. Don’t get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the basis for my calcs can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. If you are reading this and its not June 2018 then I highly recommend you check out the latest calculation for Airbus by following the link below. Check out our latest analysis for Airbus

Is AIR fairly valued?

We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second ‘steady growth’ period. To begin with we have to get estimates of the next five years of cash flows. For this I used the consensus of the analysts covering the stock, as you can see below. The sum of these cash flows is then discounted to today’s value.

5-year cash flow forecast

2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Levered FCF (€, Millions) €3.03k €4.25k €5.47k €5.80k €6.94k Source Analyst x11 Analyst x16 Analyst x13 Analyst x4 Analyst x2 Present Value Discounted @ 8.37% €2.79k €3.62k €4.30k €4.21k €4.64k

Present Value of 5-year Cash Flow (PVCF)= €19.57b

We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after the five years. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at an annual growth rate equal to the 10-year government bond rate of 0.8%. We discount this to today’s value at a cost of equity of 8.4%.

Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2022 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = €6.94b × (1 + 0.8%) ÷ (8.4% – 0.8%) = €92.09b

Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r)5 = €92.09b ÷ ( 1 + 8.4%)5 = €61.61b

Story continues

The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next five years and the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is €81.18b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. If the stock is an depositary receipt (represents a specified number of shares in a foreign corporation) then we use the equivalent number. This results in an intrinsic value of €104.64. Compared to the current share price of €101.9, the stock is about right, perhaps slightly undervalued at a 2.62% discount to what it is available for right now.

ENXTPA:AIR Intrinsic Value June 21st 18

Important assumptions

I’d like to point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don’t agree with my result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. Because we are looking at Airbus as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighed average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation I’ve used 8.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.823. This is derived from the Bottom-Up Beta method based on comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

Next Steps:

Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn’t be the only metric you look at when researching a company.

By Dominic Gates / The Seattle Times

SEATTLE — A slew of technical problems with the three most advanced models of jet aircraft engines is widely disrupting operations at airlines, bleeding cash from the engine makers and grounding significant numbers of Airbus and Boeing jets.

The most difficult of the issues has this month left almost 50 Boeing 787 Dreamliners sold to some of the world’s top airlines sitting powerless on the ground, waiting for engines before they can fly again.

And if the problem isn’t contained, it could derail Boeing’s plan to raise the 787 production rate next year.

British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce has been inspecting its Trent 1000 engines on the Dreamliners for cracked turbine blades deep inside, and taking off those with cracks for repair.

The number discovered to have problems has “outstripped our ability to support the customers with spare engines,” said Trent 1000 project director Gary Moore in an interview.

“We are causing a very disproportionate amount of disruption at this moment.”

Steve Udvar-Hazy, chairman of Air Lease Corp. and a leading figure in the airline world, said disruption from the grounded jets is compounded by airlines having to reroute some of the Dreamliners they can still fly.

Flights across the Pacific, in particular, can no longer fly normal routes because, in case of an engine emergency, safety agencies now limit Dreamliners powered by one of the Trent 1000 engine models under scrutiny to flying no more than 2.3 hours from the nearest airport — down from 5.5 hours previously.

“It’s having a huge impact. It affects a lot of the key 787 operators,” said Udvar-Hazy. “There’s a lot of scrambling going on.”

No quick fixes

The impact won’t be short term.

Rolls is returning the repaired engines to airlines with only a temporary fix. A permanent modification won’t be available until the end of the year at the earliest.

“Those engines will have to come back to us when the final fix is available,” said Moore.

Meanwhile, repeated technical problems with another engine — Pratt & Whitney’s Geared Turbofan (GTF), the innovative new design that will power close to half of the Airbus A320neo fleet — have caused Pratt to fall way behind in deliveries, leaving engineless planes to stack up on the ground at Airbus factories.

At a gathering of the world’s top airline executives in Sydney this month, Guillaume Faury, the new president of Airbus Commercial Aircraft, said that by the end of June the European jetmaker will have about 100 otherwise completed A320neos sitting grounded without engines outside its final-assembly plants in Toulouse, France, and Hamburg, Germany.

“We have an industrial crisis to manage,” Faury told trade publication Aviation Week.

In comparison, the problems with the third engine — CFM International’s LEAP engine, which powers the rest of the Airbus A320neos and all of Boeing’s 737 MAXs — are less severe.

Boeing says it’s been able to minimize the impact on MAX deliveries. But CFM had to remove dozens of LEAP engines from A320neos for repair, and LEAP deliveries to Airbus are running up to six weeks behind schedule.

Problems emerge late

These latest engines, all marvels of sophisticated engineering, incorporate significantly new technologies: new alloys in the Trent 1000, a gearbox to slow the fan speed in the GTF, ceramics in the hottest part of the LEAP.

All were certified as safe by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and its European equivalent, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).

And all three are powering the latest generation of fuel-efficient Airbus and Boeing aircraft where production rates are rising sharply to levels never before anticipated: heading up to 14 jets per month for the widebody 787, and to 60 jets per month and higher for the narrowbody 737 and A320 aircraft.

“The new technology aircraft bring tremendous economics and operating performance to the airlines, but they are only as good as the engines,” said Udvar-Hazy. “We have never seen this unprecedented number of aircraft scheduled to be produced at the very time when we have all these engine issues.”

Unfortunately, so-called “teething problems” with new technology may not show up until the engines have been used for several thousand hours in all kinds of climate conditions.

“The issue with engine certification is that’s there’s really no substitute for in-service experience,” Hazy said.

FAA spokesman Les Dorr said the safety agency monitors newly certified engines after they enter service for issues “that were not evident in the certification phase.”

And when engine makers come up with fixes to such issues, they cannot be installed on airplanes until the FAA analyzes, tests and certifies the changes.

“Engine modifications undergo the same scrutiny … as original designs,” Dorr said.

Airline trouble

The public’s belief in airplane and jet-engine safety is understandably shaken by terrifying accidents such as the April engine explosion on a Southwest Airlines 737 that killed a female passenger when shrapnel from the engine shattered the window by her seat, depressurizing the plane and partially sucking her out of the aircraft.

Yet that was the first U.S. airline-passenger fatality due to an accident in more than nine years, and the first in Southwest’s history. The engine that exploded, the CFM-56, has been in service since 1997, has flown for some 350 million flight hours and has a reliability record second to none.

Statistically, flying is the safest form of modern travel.

Jet engines have become so immensely reliable that four-engine airliners are fading into the past. Planes with just two engines safely traverse vast expanses of oceans every day. If one engine fails in flight, those jets readily fly for hours on the remaining engine to the nearest airport.

And all the newest engines send critical performance data to the ground in real time while in the air, so any irregularities are quickly detected.

The latest engine issues have produced in-flight engine shutdowns and aborted take-offs but no incidents that put passengers at risk. So for the airlines, the risk is more to the reliable operation of the airplanes than their safety.

Still, even the potential for the flaws to affect both engines of a twin-engine plane while in flight was enough to spook safety regulators to issue directives restricting flights on both the Rolls and Pratt engines.

And the trouble created for the airlines, for Airbus and Boeing, and especially for the engine makers, is serious and very expensive.

To satisfy the safety regulators and mitigate the impact on airline operations, Rolls, Pratt and CFM are throwing engineering resources and money at the technical problems.

“It’s a very painful thing for all of them,” said Udvar-Hazy.

On Friday, Rolls updated its projection of the cost of dealing with the Trent engine crisis to a total of almost $950 million.

787 engine flaw

The latest hit to Rolls came when it was still dealing with the fallout from an earlier Trent 1000 technical problem: corroded turbine blades in the hot rear section of the engine.

After redesigning those blades with a new base metal and a new coating, retrofitting the engines in service is still ongoing.

The more recent, and now more pressing, problem showed up when cracks were found in the roots of the blades of the Intermediate-Pressure Compressor (IPC), behind the fan at the front of the engine.

Moore pointed to a design flaw: The vibrating frequency of the compressor blades resonated with the frequency of the engine at high thrust, magnifying the vibration to a level that over time caused the cracks to develop.

The immediate need was to inspect the susceptible engines — initially the “Package C” version of the Trent 1000, a total of 383 engines — and remove any with cracks for repair.

The problem intensified when fractured blades and excessive vibration led to several inflight engine shutdowns and aborted takeoffs.

In response, safety regulators gave Rolls until June 9 to complete an initial set of inspections on Package C engines that have clocked more than 300 flights, though all will have to be inspected eventually.

Two days after that deadline passed, Rolls announced that the problem had spread: It found cracks in the IPC blades in a small number of engines that are a different Trent 1000 variant, the “Package B” model.

That adds another 166 Dreamliner engines that must be inspected.

Intense response

Rolls must act fast or its rival GE, which also builds Dreamliner engines, will grab its market share.

Within a month of finding the original IPC problem, Rolls engineers developed and certified an ultrasonic inspection method to detect the invisible cracks in the interior of the blades without taking the engines off the wing.

It opened facilities in Singapore and the U.K. dedicated solely to those repairs — dismantling the engines, replacing the cracked blades, treating the remaining blades to close up any invisible micro-cracks, and applying a protective lubricant.

British Airways, Air New Zealand, Virgin Atlantic, Norwegian and LATAM Airlines of Chile were among the airlines forced to ground jets when engines were removed for repair with no replacements.

Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways parent IAG, said six of the airline’s 26 Dreamliners are currently grounded, and he now expects he won’t get all of those back in service until late July.

“I have no issue with Boeing, who have been proactive and supportive … I am however, very unhappy with Rolls-Royce,” Walsh said, via email. “They have yet to give us confidence that they are on top of the problem.”

British Airways and Virgin Atlantic leased Airbus A330 aircraft to fill the schedule gap. Air New Zealand leased two Boeing 777s to fill in. Norwegian leased a four-engine Airbus A340 gas-guzzler to fly its Paris-Los Angeles route.

Rolls hopes by year end to certify a permanent fix — a redesigned blade with tolerances tweaked to shift its resonant frequency.

Moore said Rolls engineers are now testing the first modified hardware in a development engine at a facility in Derby, U.K., to verify that “we have moved the blade’s frequency to a point where I no longer have concerns.”

A second test engine will be used to confirm that the engine’s overall operation is unaffected by the change to the blades.

Next year, Rolls plans to gradually remove all those repaired engines once again to install the permanent modifications.

Meanwhile, Boeing deployed teams worldwide with Rolls-Royce to try to mitigate the disruption at affected airlines and tapped senior executive Keith Leverkuhn to work directly with Rolls.

“Keith and I talk every day,” said Moore.

Knife-edge seal

For Pratt & Whitney’s new GTF engine, developed starting in the early 2000s at a cost of more than $10 billion, the advance worry was that it might run into trouble with the engine’s big technology innovation: the gearbox that allows the fan to run slower and more efficiently.

It turns out the gearbox has operated smoothly with no issues. However, the GTF did run into a rash of other “teething problems.”

Though Pratt developed fixes for all of them and the latest engines it’s building are up to date with those fixes, GTF production has been hampered and delayed, and deliveries to Airbus were interrupted.

Spokeswoman Jenny Dervin said the latest problem arose after a batch of engineering changes were introduced last December to improve the durability of the High Pressure Compressor (HPC).

Instead, the changes caused “the knife-edge seal” in the HPC’s aft hub to fracture, resulting in sudden vibration and engine stall in some A320neos. This led to several inflight engine shutdowns and aborted take-offs.

“By the end of January, we knew we’d have to recall the engines,” Dervin said.

Only 98 engines had been built with the defective seals — 43 in service and another 55 still at the Airbus final assembly plants.

In February, EASA issued an airworthiness directive prohibiting airlines from flying any plane that had the defect on both engines. India’s air-safety regulator grounded planes having even one such engine.

By now, no GTF engines flying anywhere have the defective seal. For Pratt, what remains is to clear the backlog of engines to be delivered to Airbus.

Loss of a thin coating

For CFM’s LEAP engine, and specifically for Boeing’s 737 MAX, the introduction into service has been smoother. On the MAX and the Airbus A320neo, LEAP engines are now powering 342 aircraft with 56 airlines.

However, the LEAP was hit by one technical glitch related to a key innovation: a ceramic composite lining that shrouds the hottest part of the engine, the first rotor of the High-Pressure Turbine just aft of the fuel combustion chamber.

This ceramic material requires a thin protective coating. Rick Lowden, a research scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which developed the ceramic material, said that without such a coating, moisture in the gas emerging from the combustor will oxidize the ceramics and gradually “eat it away.”

CFM spokeswoman Jamie Jewell said engineers found a “premature loss” of this coating in service.

“This is not a safety or operational issue,” Jewell said, adding that the problem hasn’t caused any incidents during thousands of hours of engine tests and more than a million engine in-service flight hours.

To fix it, CFM designed a new coating. That’s being introduced into full-rate production for aircraft deliveries starting this month.

And about 60 LEAP engines were removed from A320neos for modification, none from 737 MAXs.

“Each of those removals were scheduled in advance and we are supporting the removals with around 70 spare engines,” Jewell said.

Boeing said that there have been some delays in delivery of MAX engines but so far no airplane deliveries are late.

Flying hotter, tighter and harder

Airlines today operate jet engines harder than ever before. They’re built to tighter tolerances and operate at higher pressures and hotter temperatures.

They fly many more flights and much longer flights than in the past.

Boeing projects that the 2016 worldwide airliner fleet of 23,500 jets will double in the next two decades, swelling the number of engines in the sky.

But near term, the plans by Airbus and Boeing to hike A320neo, 737 MAX and 787 production significantly in the next two years cannot happen until the engine makers sort out their problems and ramp up production.

To deliver the reliability airlines demand on the narrowbody jets, Pratt & Whitney and CFM must hope no further teething pains develop.

Rolls-Royce faces a more existential crisis.

It’s separately going through a drastic financial and corporate restructuring costing $670 million and last week announced layoffs of 4,600 employees over the next two years.

A Rolls nightmare would be if the same blade-durability problems show up later on the remaining variants of the Trent engine: the newest version for the 787 the Trent TEN, or the Trent XWB for the Airbus A350, or the Trent 7000 for the Airbus A330neo.

To survive, Rolls needs to convince airlines soon that the Trent’s technical problems are finally contained.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9961177110671997}",negative,0.9961177110671997,-1

Representatives from Airbus, TAP Portugal, Rolls Royce, RECARO, and MIA were on hand to show off the newest Airbus widebody jet, the A330neo, for the first time in the United States. This is the first aircraft delivered to launch customer TAP Portugal.

The aircraft is embarking on a worldwide proving tour to complete the rigorous certification process. Airbus is betting on this aircraft to turn a profit in the highly competitive mid-sized aircraft market.

The newest version of their already popular classic A330 will have commonality with the rest of the new Airbus lineup, range capable for longer missions, new generation reliability and modern avionics similar to the A350 including the Skywise system which will deliver more data than ever before in a widebody aircraft to monitor the status and help in preventative maintenance of the aircraft.

One of the most important changes Airbus is hedging on to land sales is the improved efficiency and range brought on by the new Trent 7000 engine and the new optimized wing that is 4m longer and includes a composite Sharklet. This A330-900 will have a range of 1500nm more than its predecessor while delivering efficiency in the same range as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

Finally, the interior of the A330neo has been completely redesigned to match the more open cabin found on their A350 and includes RECARO seats, programmable mood lighting, larger overhead bins and new lavatories. The A330neo is about 200 flight hours from completing its certification. Following that, the aircraft will be put into revenue service with TAP.

Airbus will fly its brand new A330neo to Mauritius for the first time, as part of the final phase of test flights leading to the Type Certification of its latest mid-size widebody airliner. The aircraft, an A330-900 painted in the livery of launch operator TAP Air Portugal, will arrive at 12:50 am on 30th June at Sir-Seewoosagur-Ramgoolam International Airport (MRU) after a flight from Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia). This stopover is part of the ”route proving” campaign taking place around the world designed to demonstrate to aviation authorities its compatibility with airports and readiness for airline operations. This trip marks the A330neo’s first time in Africa.

The A330neo is the latest version of the best-selling twin aisle A330 Family and is available in two versions, with the A330-800 seating around 250 passengers in three classes and up to 400 in an all Economy layout, and the larger A330-900 offering accommodation for around 300 in three classes, or up to 440 in a high density single class configuration.

Air Mauritius has already ordered two A330-900 on lease from ALC, and later this year, Air Mauritius will be the world’s first airline to operate both the A330neo and the A350 XWB, the Airbus leading widebody family. Air Mauritius currently operates a fleet of 12 Airbus aircraft of which two A350s, six A340s, two A330s for long haul operations and two A319s for regional services.

Launched in July 2014, the A330neo family is the new generation A330. It builds on the proven economics, versatility and reliability of the A330 family, while reducing fuel consumption by about 25 percent versus previous generation competitors and increasing range by up to 1,500nm compared to the majority of A330s in operation. The A330neo is powered by Rolls-Royce’s latest-generation Trent 7000 engines and features a new wing with increased span and new A350 XWB inspired Sharklets.

Passengers can expect the highest levels of comfort when flying on the A330neo, with the aircraft featuring the award-winning Airbus Airspace cabin. The Airspace cabin has newly designed sidewalls and fixtures, larger overheard storage, advanced cabin mood lighting and the latest in-flight entertainment and connectivity.

The A330 is the most popular widebody aircraft ever, having won over 1,700 orders from 119 customers worldwide. Today, over 1,370 A330s are in service with 125 airlines, flying on everything from high density domestic and regional operations to long range intercontinental routes. Type Certification for the A330neo is scheduled for Q3 2018, followed by entry-into-commercial service with TAP Air Portugal.

Editor’s Note

The aircraft being used for the route proving trials is an A330-900 production aircraft for A330neo launch operator TAP Air Portugal. The aircraft is fitted with the airline’s cabin interior comprising 34 seats in Business Class, 96 seats in Economy Plus and 168 seats in Economy. The aircraft is also fitted with limited flight test instrumentation to record a range of performance parameters during flights. The aircraft is operated by Airbus flight test pilots.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9905011653900146}",neutral,0.9905011653900146,0

The is the latest in a series of high profile incident involving damaged airplane windows. Last month, the windshield of another Airbus A319 failed mid-flight nearly sucking the flight's first officer out of the plane. The windshield failure also damaged the control panel housing the plane's autopilot systems. None of the Sichuan Airlines flight's 119 passengers suffered serious injuries.

In April, a window onboard Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 blew out after being damaged by debris from an explosive engine failure. The incident took the life of passenger Jennifer Riordan and forced the Boeing 737-700 to make an emergency landing in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

The National Transportation Safety Board is conducting a full investigation of the Southwest flight that is expected to take more than a year to complete.

These will replace Rega’s existing fleet of EC145 helicopters, which will be phased out by mid-2019.

Over a period of 15 years, the six EC145s have proven themselves to be reliable and versatile rescue helicopters, providing airborne medical assistance to around 60,000 patients to date. Thanks in part to these positive experiences, Rega is now opting for the H145, the successor to the EC145.

“The H145 represents a continuation of our success story and ensures that we can continue to provide our patients with reliable and professional help in the years to come,” said Ernst Kohler, CEO of Rega.

“We are proud that such an internationally renowned operator as Rega has placed its trust in our H145 family over such a long period of time,” said Wolfgang Schoder, CEO of Airbus Helicopters Deutschland.

The H145 is the market leader for police and rescue missions with a combined fleet of over 200 helicopters worldwide, which have jointly accumulated more than 100,000 flight hours.

The agile H145 is particularly well suited for special intensive care transports thanks to its spacious cabin and a maximum take-off weight of 3.7 tons.

The helicopters are equipped with the Helionix digital avionics suite, providing user-friendly flight data management and a high-performance 4-axis autopilot, which considerably reduces pilot workload during missions. Its particularly low acoustic footprint makes the H145 the quietest helicopter in its class.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999992847442627}",positive,0.9999992847442627,1

A German investment company said on Tuesday it would strip two unwanted Airbus A380 superjumbo passenger jets for parts after failing to find an airline willing to keep them flying following a decision by Singapore Airlines not to keep them in service.The decision by Dortmund-based Dr Peters Group deals a fresh blow to the planemaker's efforts to maintain market interest in the double-decker, barely 10 years after it went into service hailed by heads of state as a symbol of European ambition.""Psychologically it is not good for Airbus, but this is a very large aircraft with a very small second-hand market,"" said UK-based aerospace analyst Howard Wheeldon.

Despite strong reviews for its quiet and spacious cabin, demand for the 544-seater has fallen as many airlines drop the industry's largest four-engined aircraft in favour of smaller twin-engined ones that are more efficient, and easier to fill.""It's too big. There was a battle for airline fashions and it lost out,"" Wheeldon said.Airbus says the iconic jet will eventually prove itself as travel demand saturates airport capacity at major cities.""We can't comment on the decision by Dr Peters, which is the owner of the aircraft,"" an Airbus spokesman said.""We remain confident in the secondary market for the A380 and the potential to extend the operator base.""Singapore Airlines launched A380 services amid fanfare in December 2007, but returned the first two aircraft to their German financiers when leases expired some 10 years later.The two discarded aircraft were repainted and flown to Tarbes in the French Pyrenees to be stored, and since then their fate has been uncertain as their owner looked for other takers.""After extensive as well as intensive negotiations with various airlines such as British Airways, HiFly and IranAir, Dr Peters Group has decided to sell the aircraft components and will recommend this approach to its investors,"" the company said in a statement emailed to Reuters.Airbus has been working for months to try to stimulate a second-hand market for the A380 to encourage new airlines to take the risk of investing in the plane, knowing the asset would be worth the right amount when they decide to sell it on.When it was launched, the A380 boasted highly customised interiors to help airlines promote a luxury feel, but the cost of replacing such bespoke fittings is now seen as a handicap.""The problem is the cost of reconfiguration. It is $40 million or more per plane,"" a senior industry source said.The planes will not be scrapped entirely, but their huge frames will be combed for valuable components such as landing gears and electronics, a Dr Peters official told Reuters.Their engines have already been removed and leased back to manufacturer Rolls-Royce for use as spares.U.S.-based VAS Aero Services will be responsible for extracting and selling parts.Dr Peters said the deal would yield a positive return for investors in funds used to finance the jets. It operates a number of boutique funds targeted at wealthy individuals and has two more A380s in Singapore that could face the same fate.While dismantling the first two passenger-carrying A380s will embarrass Airbus and dismay the plane's 3,800 workers, later examples of the flagship jet may not be as vulnerable.Early copies of a new plane tend to be less efficient and Singapore Airlines recently ordered some new A380s. However, overall demand is thinner than Airbus expected, forcing it to slow production to a trickle while looking for more business.Still, Emirates, the largest A380 customer, is keeping faith with the jet which brings millions of passengers a year through its Dubai hub and is associated with the airline's global brand.Throwing the loss-making programme a lifeline for a decade, Emirates recently ordered up to 36 more A380s and set out plans on Tuesday to install 56 Premium Economy seats.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9380226731300354}",neutral,0.9380226731300354,0
