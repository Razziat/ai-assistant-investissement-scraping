New Korean Air Airbus A380 Makes First Flight to America - NYCAviation - NYCAviation,"Tue, 09 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55Y2F2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDExLzA4L25ldy1rb3JlYW4tYWlyLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLW1ha2VzLWZpcnN0LWZsaWdodC10by1hbWVyaWNhLzE2ODM30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Korean Air’s first transpacific Airbus A380 flight arrived in New York today, also marking the first scheduled use by any carrier of the superjumbo between east Asia and the east coast of North America.

More photos below…

With only 407 seats — 121 fewer than the current most densely configured A380 — Korean Air hopes to attract business class flyers on their 12-14 hour trips between Seoul and New York, as well as other long-haul destinations in Europe and Asia.

Korean’s business class cabin, dubbed Prestige Class, consists of 94 lie-flat seats, filling the entire upper deck of the aircraft. The main level is made up of 12 Kosmo Suites for first class passengers and 301 economy class seats with a very respectable 34-in. of seat pitch.

Flights 81 and 82 to and from JFK will be operated with A380 equipment three days a week until September 1st, after which it will go daily thanks to a third A380 joining the fleet. (The airline’s Boeing 777 aircraft will the other flights).

It is also the first A380 livery so far to feature a dominant color other than white. Gawkers at the three-week-old jet were overheard comparing it to a “big, shiny Tiffany box.”

The tight turn of the day’s schedule prevented us from getting a tour of the new plane, but we hope to get a peek onboard soon.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999984502792358}",neutral,0.9999984502792358,0
"With replicas, airlines get a feel for jets - Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette","Sun, 21 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDExL2F1Zy8yMS9yZXBsaWNhcy1haXJsaW5lcy1nZXQtZmVlbC1qZXRzLTIwMTEwODIxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"— Every day, Airbus customers travel to the company’s headquarters in Toulouse to visit its spacious mockup room.

There, they board fullscale mock-ups of the commercial airliners Airbus sells. The mock-ups replicate the cabin interiors of the jets the customers have on order.

The mock-ups help airlines select the size and placement of seats, lavatories, crew rest areas and other interior features. Various options are installed inside the mock-ups.

“They’ve got to get a feel for what it’s really like,” said John Blanchfield, Airbus director of technical marketing, standing by a mock-up of an A350XWB, the twin-aisle jet being developed to compete with Boeing’s new 787 Dreamliner.

Airlines have to get the “right revenue mix,” said Mike Boyd, an airline consultant with the Boyd Group.

The question is “how to maximize your revenue mix without your customers feeling like they just entered a sales barn.”

Decisions are often based on how the plane will be used.

Aircraft on shorter, domestic flights have more economy seats and less first-class or business seating.

Aircraft on international flights include more firstclass and business-class seats to meet higher demand.

“You just can’t cram them all in,” Boyd said of the passengers on international flights.

How many seats in each class also depends on passengers’ willingness to pay.

Boyd, who lives near Denver, said he recently purchased a ticket on a flight to Berlin. The difference between a first-class ticket and a business-class fare was $12,000.

At $19,000, an airline may sell five first-class tickets. Meanwhile, it may sell 25 business-class tickets at $7,000 each, he said.

Airbus and Boeing have in-house experts who help airlines with the decisions. They look at the routes and do the calculations.

“They want airlines to keep on making money,” Boyd said, so they can sell more airplanes.

Inside a mock-up of the Airbus A380 superjumbo jet, a customer is met with calming blue mood lighting and a spacious entryway.

Separate divisions of seating on both levels make the double-decker plane seem smaller and more private. That’s important on a plane equipped with 400 to 800 seats, depending on the airline’s preference.

On the first floor of the mock-up, seating ranged from four first-class seats abreast to eight and 10 abreast for economy seating.

Research also helps Airbus with decisions on passenger comfort. Recent research is helping it decide where to position passenger windows.

Airbus’ research forecast a change in size in the world’s population and projected how large humans will be by the year 2020.

“We’ve all gotten bigger,” Blanchfield said, sitting in a passenger seat by a window inside one of the mock-ups.

Designers used the projected height of an American male passenger in 2020 to determine the window’s placement at its uppermost point. It used the projected size of a Japanese female in 2020 to determine its lowest point, Blanchfield said.

That way, the window will be utilized by passengers of various sizes.

Where to place the crew rest area on long-haul flights is also an important consideration. Crew rests ideally shouldn’t take up space a paying passenger could be using, Blanchfield said.

In its new A350XWB, the crew rest area is tucked away in the roof of the airplane.

The A350XWB will be able to fly up to 14 hours, which means it will have to carry a second crew by regulations, Blanchfield said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999881982803345}",neutral,0.9999881982803345,0

The keel beam provides structural continuity to the fuselage at the landing gear compartment. The A350 XWB programme is the first programme in which the keel beam and the aft lower shell have been combined to form a single major component.

This immense part, made out of 70% composites, is 16.5m long and 4.3m wide and weighs 1.2 tonnes. Its assembly in the Nantes factory required the use of 10,000 fasteners to join 2,000 parts.

The second aircraft will be delivered later this year, and the third in early 2012.

This modernized C212–400 series incorporates the latest systems and technologies, such as a Flight Management System (FMS). As a Coast Guard airplane, it will primarily be used in its Maritime Patrol role and carry out missions such as coastal surveillance, illegal fishing, drug traffic and smuggling, among others.

We are very proud of the trust placed by the Vietnam Marine Police in Airbus Military, and look forward to the upcoming entry into service of one of our highly versatile products to help enforce law on the Vietnamese coast, says Airbus Military Head of Light & Medium Programmes, Rafael Tentor.

Pilots and aircraft maintenance specialists were trained to operate the aircraft at the Airbus Military Training Centre in Seville.

This C212 is the first Airbus Military product that the Government of Vietnam will operate.

To date, Airbus Military has sold 477 C212 to 92 different operators.

About C212

The outstanding reliability demonstrated by more than three million flight hours makes the C212 the most successful aircraft in the light transport segment for the most varied types of operations. With a maximum payload of 2.8 tonnes, it was designed to operate in austere environments for long periods of time. Its robustness allows it an absolutely reliable operation in the desert, the jungle o the Antarctic. Its unique STOL performance with low-pressure tires allows unrestricted operations on soft and unpaved fields in hot and high altitude conditions. The excellent handling qualities and its fast engine response enable the highest level of manoeuvrability at very low altitudes. The C212 simple design and maintenance reduce the life cycle costs to the lowest level in its segment.

The centre wing box for the new Airbus A350 XWB aircraft measures 6.5 m by 5.5 m and is 3.9 m tall.

Loaded on to a special transport jig, the centre wing box left Airbus' site in Nantes, France, by river barge, together with an A380 centre wing box, travelling along the Loire River to reach St Nazaire a few hours later. Once the part is installed in the A350 XWB fuselage, the sub-assembly will be flown by Beluga from St Nazaire to Airbus’ new A350 XWB final assembly line in Toulouse, France.

The first composite lay-up for the A350 XWB took place in Nantes in December 2009. The biggest panels produced for the centre wing box, entirely made of carbon fibre, have a surface area of 36 m2, which Airbus says makes them the largest 'monobloc' composite panels ever manufactured in Nantes.

The A350 XWB structure is 53% composite-based, including major elements such as wings and fuselage.The first aircraft is scheduled to be delivered in 2013.

The delivery of the centre wing box marks a significant step forwards for the A350 XWB programme as it gets closer to the start of final assembly of the first aircraft, notes comments Didier Evrard, Head of the A350 XWB programme.

“The delivery of the first A350 XWB centre wing box is the result of the team’s sheer hard work, expertise in the design and manufacturing of complex, large composite structures and their strong commitment to deliver to our customers on time and on quality,"" he says.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999970197677612}",neutral,0.9999970197677612,0

Aug 11, 2011 | By Luxuo

Korean Air is to inaugurate its new A380 “superjumbo” on a route between New York City and Seoul this week.

The airline, which is the seventh in the world to fly the enormous Airbus aircraft, will wave off the first A380 flight from New York across the Pacific Ocean on August 9, launching what it describes as a “new age of air travel.”

It will be the first A380 service between Asia and New York, carrying some 407 passengers — considerably less than the 525 that the A380 is capable of.





Korean Air says that this makes room for a more spacious cabin, with 301 passengers in economy class, 94 lie-flat sleeper seats spaced six feet apart on the upper business deck and 12 first-class suites.

The aircraft also holds three bars, all for premium passengers — the Celestial bar, a cocktail lounge at the rear of the business class upper deck, another self-service bar at the front of the business-class deck, and a bar reserved for the use of first-class passengers only.

Passengers on board can also visit the world’s first in-flight duty free outlet, a compact area selling cosmetics, perfumes, liquor and accessories that are magnetized to ensure they don’t fall off the shelves if the aircraft hits turbulence.

The route is to run between Seoul and New York every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday through August before switching to become a daily service from September.

Korean Air’s major rival, Asiana Airlines, announced in January that it intends to purchase six A380s for routes to Europe and the United States.

An airport is a fascinating place. People coming and going. Airplanes taking off and landing, being loaded and unloaded. It’s a place where people from around the world converge.

Frankfurt Airport — the third busiest in Europe after London Heathrow and Paris-Charles de Gaulle — is no different.

There are a few ways to watch the action at Frankfurt: There is the visitors terrace at Terminal 2, a bus tour that takes you along the flight line or you can just sit in one of the airport’s many bars, restaurants and cafes and watch traveling folk pass by.

Taking the 45-minute bus tour is not unlike taking a plane. You buy tickets, go through a security check and then you are on your way.

The bus joins the busy traffic pattern of vehicles serving and servicing the airplanes. It stops near the runway so you can get a closer look at aircraft taking off and landing.

It drives by the Lufthansa cargo area and past the giant maintenance hangar that can service six Boeing 747s at once.

Nearby is the new air-traffic-control tower. With a new runway due to open north of the airport in October, the new tower will be able to overlook all of the runways.

The bus loops around the new extension of Concourse A, where you get a look at jets pulling away from the gates.

The visitors terrace, once on top of Terminal 1, is now at Terminal 2, overlooking the gates.

From here you can see planes from more than 100 airlines land and take off, flying to almost 300 destinations around the world.

Families waiting for friends to arrive or depart are among the visitors here, but you will also see people with binoculars scanning the airport, scribbling notes into a little book, then popping up to the railing to take photos of planes. These are “tail watchers,” and watching planes is their passion. They note the type of aircraft, airline and tail number of the planes, hoping to see every plane that flies the skies.

It was founded in 2004 and currently has a fleet of six Airbus A320 aircraft. At one time, the airline had 30 A320s on order, but in 2010 aircraft were parked and five had their leases stopped. Jazeera Airways cancelled most of their orders and now only has four A320s on order with Airbus.

The airline was started when the Kuwait government allowed Jazeera Airways to operate, ending Kuwait Airway’s monopoly in the country.

The livery has a lot of white and I almost wish they would have made part of the bottom or have a stripe that was teal. One fun part, you don’t see on many liveries, is the blue behind the tail surrounding the APU. It is pretty difficult to read the airline’s name on the front, on the engines and on the tail due to the font chosen.

"Best seats: Club Europe business class, British Airways Airbus A319 - Executive Traveller","Tue, 30 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vYmVzdC1zZWF0cy1jbHViLWV1cm9wZS1idXNpbmVzcy1jbGFzcy1icml0aXNoLWFpcndheXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzMTnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Travelling to a European city on British Airways? You're quite likely to be on one of the airline's Airbus A320 planes -- so here's how to pick the best seat in Club Europe, BA's short-haul business class.

The plane

If you're not on the 43-strong A320 fleet (and here's our guide to the best seats on those planes), you're most likely to be on one of the airline's 33 Airbus A319s. They're the slightly shorter member of the same aircraft family.

If you're travelling to Europe on BA from London's second airport Gatwick, you're even more likely to be on one of these planes.

The Club Europe cabin

As standard ""Eurobusiness"" seats, these are essentially Economy with slightly more legroom, a bit more width and nobody in the middle seat next to you.

Club Europe seats are four across when in Club Europe configuration, with two seats on the left and two seats on the right of the aisle. It can stretch as far back as row 9, but usually isn't extended that much.

A and C seats on the left are slightly wider, as they expand into a narrowed seat B. (If the seats were in economy configuration, all three would be normal size and occupied.) On the right hand, only

seats D and F are sold in Club Europe, with middle seat E always left empty.

With 34 inches of pitch (the space between your seat back and the one in front), there's not an awful lot of room -- but on a short flight, you might not notice too much.

The best seats on the plane

1C: since the bulkhead wall ahead of row 1 doesn't stretch all the way across 1C's legroom, you get extra space to stretch your legs. (Keep an eye out for passengers or crew falling over them, though). On the downside, you're not allowed bags with you during takeoff and landing, and people may stumble over your feet.

1A 1D 1F: other bulkhead seats in row 1 are a popular choice because there's nobody in front reclining into your space -- and that's important with a fairly high-density layout. On the downside, you can't stretch out your legs underneath the seat in front of you (because there isn't one), and your bag must be put overhead for takeoff and landing.

Row 9: only rarely does Club Europe stretch this far back into the cabin, but if you're on a business class-heavy flight, pick these seats for a few inches of extra legroom. (Again, you won't be able to have your bags with you for takeoff and landing, and you'll be at the back of Club Europe when disembarking.)

As a general rule, try to sit as far forwards as possible: there's less noise from the engine and from economy class behind, and you'll be faster off the plane.

The worst seats on the plane

Row 8: avoid these seats since the recline is restricted because the row behind is an exit row.

Row 7: if you enjoy looking out at the European landscape, you're best picking a row further ahead because the view's partially blocked by the aircraft wing.

Rio-Paris jet crash probe 'discredited': relatives - SKNVibes.com,"Wed, 03 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNrbnZpYmVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ld3NkZXRhaWxzLmNmbS8zNjkyMdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Paris, FRA) - Victims' relatives and a pilots' union Wednesday said they had lost faith in a probe into the 2009 crash of an Air France jet that killed 228 people, alleging it sought to clear Airbus of responsibility.

The latest twist in the enquiry into why the Airbus A330 plunged into the Atlantic en route from Rio to Paris came after French media reported that the body leading the probe had withdrawn a recommendation to change stall alarms.

Instead, the French air accident investigation authority BEA on Friday released an interim report into the June 1, 2009 crash in which it said that the pilots were not trained to handle the jet when it stalled in rough weather.

The BEA recommended ""the regulatory authorities re-examine the content of training (for pilots) and in particular make mandatory the creation of regular specific exercises aimed at manual airplane handling"" in the event of a stall.

Air France immediately defended its pilots, saying the stall alarm had malfunctioned, while victims' families and pilots said the dropped recommendation showed the probe was apparently aimed at absolving Airbus.

Robert Soulas, head of a victims' relatives support group, said that ""this sad episode definitively discredits the technical probe (and) creates an unprecedented crisis of confidence with the enquiry's authorities.""

""The haste with which these authorities and these officials accused the pilots without any forethought aroused our suspicions,"" he said in a statement.

""We now have confirmation that the affirmations coming from the BEA were not only premature, (but) lacking any objectivity, partial and very oriented towards the defence of Airbus.""

The National Airline Pilots Union (SNPL) said it wanted to suspend its involvement in the enquiry, fearing it would ""turn into a simple charge sheet against the crew.""

The union said in a statement that its faith in the BEA was ""seriously damaged.""

The BEA confirmed that it had been mulling a recommendation concerning stall alarms but had left it out as it wanted to investigate further. The BEA is to publish its final report in 2012.

Junior Transport Minister Thierry Mariani hailed the report of the BEA, which reports to his ministry, as exemplary and transparent, pouring scorn on ""controversies"" surrounding it.

""There has never been such a transparent enquiry: it was filmed, took place under the judiciary's control, with Brazilian, American investigators,"" he told AFP. ""These controversies discredit an enquiry that is exemplary.""

He said his ministry's relationship with the BEA was ""an administrative and budgetary link, but not at all hierarchical.""

Air France and Airbus are being investigated for alleged manslaughter in connection with the crash, notably because of malfunctioning speed sensors known as Pitots.

The airline replaced the Pitots, manufactured by French company Thales, on its Airbus planes with a newer model after the crash.

Victims' families have previously alleged that the involvement of big French corporations such as Airbus and Air France was influencing the affair.

But Airbus told AFP that it was inconceivable that the manufacturer would try to gloss over security issues for the entirety of around 180 airlines using the A330 because of a purely French situation.

""Can you imagine for an instant that, because of economic interests or links between the BEA and Airbus, we'd put in peril all the other airlines operating this plane? It's neither conceivable nor admissible,"" an unnamed Airbus spokesman said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8217450976371765}",neutral,0.8217450976371765,0
"Best seats: Club Europe business class, British Airways Airbus A320 - Executive Traveller","Mon, 01 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vYmVzdC1zZWF0cy1jbHViLWV1cm9wZS1idXNpbmVzcy1jbGFzcy1icml0aXNoLWFpcndheXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If you're connecting to one of British Airways' European flights at London Heathrow, you're likely to up on one of BA's Airbus A320 aircraft.

But which are the best seats in Club Europe, BA's short-haul business class?

The plane

British Airways has over forty A320s based at its Heathrow hub, and they're the backbone of the short-haul fleet.

You'll see them flying international flights into Europe and north Africa, but they're not usually seen on domestic UK flights, which are single-class economy.

The Club Europe cabin

Club Europe seats are convertible ""Eurobusiness"" style, which means that business class can stretch back only a few rows or as far back as row 13, depending on demand for that day's flights.

The seats themselves are four across when in Club Europe configuration, with two seats on the left and two seats on the right of the aisle.

The seats on the left (A and C) are slightly wider, as they expand into a shrunken seat B. (If the seats were in economy configuration, all three would be normal size and occupied. On the right hand, seats D and F are sold in Club Europe, with middle seat E always left empty.

With 34 inches of pitch (the space between your seat back and the one in front, which you can call your own space during the flight), there's not an awful lot of room -- but on a short flight, you might not notice too much.

The best seats on the plane

1C: the bulkhead in front of row 1 doesn't stretch all the way across 1C's legroom, which means you get extra space to stretch your legs (so long as you keep an eye out for passengers or crew falling over them). On the downside, you're not allowed bags with you during takeoff and landing.

1A 1D 1F: the rest of the bulkhead seats are good because there's nobody in front reclining into your limited space. On the downside, you can't stretch out your legs underneath the seat in front of you (because there isn't one), and your bag must be put overhead for takeoff and landing.

Row 11: it's a rare flight where Club Europe stretches back 11 rows. But if it does, there's a few inches extra legroom in row 11, the exit row. Again, no bags during takeoff and landing.

Row 10: nearly as good as row 11 since it's an exit row, but these seats don't recline.

The worst seats on the plane

Row 9: on most flights, Club Europe won't stretch as far back as row 9. But if it does, beware: there's limited recline because row 10 is an emergency exit row.

In general, you want to be as far forward as possible for less noise from economy behind, and to make a speedy exit from the plane.

Lufthansa Airbus A380 named after the Austrian capital - Times of Malta,"Sun, 28 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZm1hbHRhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL0x1ZnRoYW5zYS1BaXJidXMtQTM4MC1uYW1lZC1hZnRlci10aGUtQXVzdHJpYW4tY2FwaXRhbC4zODIzNDXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"One of Lufthansa’s Airbus A380s is now the proud bearer for the first time of the name of Wien. The naming ceremony, attended by 250 invited guests, was held at Vienna Airport shortly after the mega-jetliner’s early-morning arrival in the Austrian capital.

Vienna Airport is the central hub of Austrian Airlines, which is based there as one of the Lufthansa Group Airlines. It plays an important role in the global route network of the Lufthansa Group.

“The naming of the most modern and biggest aircraft type in the Lufthansa fleet after the Austrian capital underlines the importance of Vienna in our operations,” said Stefan Lauer, Member of the Lufthansa executive board and supervisory board chairman of Austrian Airlines AG.

After opening remarks from Mr Stefan Lauer, the Vienna Mayor Michael Häupl poured sparkling wine over the giant plane before unveiling the name of Wien emblazoned in elegant lettering on the aircraft’s huge fuselage.

Following completion of the naming ceremony’s official and symbolic activities, the guests of honour boarded the doubledecker aircraft to enjoy a closer look at the cabin and its design.

Lufthansa’s new flagship later left on a scheduled flight from Frankfurt to Johannesburg to begin carrying its new name around the world.

The German airline is already operating eight Airbus A380s on long-haul services from Frankfurt to Asia (Tokyo, Peking), Africa (Johannesburg) and North America (New York, San Francisco, Miami). Two more of that type are scheduled to join the fleet next year.

The newly-named A380 Wien, registration D-AIMG, known internally as Mike Golf after the last two letters, has been in service since May and has meantime logged around 1,500 flying hours on about 330 flights in the Lufthansa timetable. The Wien attracted particular attention on May 7 when circling Hamburg in formation with the legendary old timer Ju52, operated by the Lufthansa Berlin Stiftung, to mark the 822nd anniversary of Hamburg harbour.

Together with the entire Lufthansa A380 fleet, the Wien is based at Frankfurt Airport, from where it flies on scheduled services.

Passengers from Austria fly into Frankfurt to board connecting flights to any of the A380 destinations. In the coming winter timetable, the Airbus 380 will also be flying daily to Singapore. (Source: Lufthansa)","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999997615814209}",neutral,0.999997615814209,0
The best seats in Business/Star Class on Jetstar's Airbus A330 - Executive Traveller,"Fri, 19 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vdGhlLWJlc3Qtc2VhdHMtaW4tYnVzaW5lc3Mtc3Rhci1jbGFzcy1vbi1qZXRzdGFyLXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzMzDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Travelling in Jetstar's Business Class on long-distance flights from Australia and New Zealand? Here's our guide to picking the best seats on the plane.

The plane

Jetstar's Business Class -- formerly known as Star Class -- is only found on the airline's long-distance flights that use Airbus A330 planes.

That means you'll only see the option on some -- but not necessarily all -- long-haul flights to Hawaii, Phuket, Bangkok, Tokyo, Osaka, Melbourne, Sydney, Gold Coast, Cairns, Singapore, Auckland and Bali.

The cabin

Jetstar Business Class is really an international premium economy class, or a watered-down domestic Australian business offering.

With a 38-inch seat pitch (the space between your seatback and the one in front), there's not an awful lot of room.

There are 38 business class seats in a 2-3-2 configuration across six rows. By comparison, Qantas' international version of the same plane has one fewer seat per row and one fewer row in the cabin for a total of eight fewer seats.

The best seats on the plane

1A 1K: with nobody reclining back into you, and an easier hop out for the person in the aisle seat, these are definitely rows to pick if you're a window fan. Bear in mind that you may be moved to make way for an infant, though, and if you're very tall you may prefer to sit in another row to extend your legs fully under the seat in front of you.

1E 1F: if you're an aisle seat fan, these are great because there's no middle seat in the first row. So nobody will be climbing over you to get out. (The advice above about babies and tall people applies here too.)

2D 2F: looking for the most legroom? These are the seats to pick, because with only two seats in row 1, row 2's aisle seats let you stretch your legs out to the side. Bear in mind that you're likely to be run over by a trolley or trampled in flight, though.

The worst seats on the plane

2E 3E 4E 5E: these middle seats mean you have to climb over someone. Avoid them if you can.

Row 6: at the very back of the cabin, you're more likely to be disturbed by the galley kitchen to the centre of the plane and economy class behind you.

Row 5: Still close to the galley kitchen, there's likely to be more noise here as well.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.99998939037323}",neutral,0.99998939037323,0
The best seats in Economy Class on Cathay Pacific's Airbus A330 - Executive Traveller,"Mon, 08 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vYmVzdC1zZWF0cy1lY29ub215LWNhdGhheS1wYWNpZmljLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzMw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Nobody likes to fly international economy at the best of times, but many companies mandate economy travel for 'regional' travel -- which can include trips between Sydney and most of Asia. And of course, many small businesses and the self-employed find it challenging to justify business class fares on even this journey.

So if you're travelling in economy class on Cathay Pacific's Airbus A330s -- which run from Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Cairns to Hong Kong and back -- here's some help in choosing the best seats and avoiding the worst ones.

Click here to read our world first review of Cathay Pacific's new international economy seats

The plane

Cathay Pacific's new Business Class has been getting a lot of attention recently, and we're certainly among its fans (see our report here).

But down at the back of the bus in Economy, the story's a little more mixed. Cathay's 'fixed shell’ economy seats have come in for a fair degree of criticism, to the point where the Hong Kong flag carrier tells us it is “working quite aggressively” on an overhaul for the seats.

The Economy Class cabin

Economy starts at row 30 and continues all the way to the back of the plane. Row numbering varies across the several cabin layouts Cathay uses -- so, no, there aren't 29 rows of business class, they've just decided that economy always starts at row 30.

There are two sections of the Economy Class cabin, one that starts at row 30 and one that starts at row 54. Both are laid out in 2-4-2 configuration.

(For infrequent travellers, that means that A & C seats are to the left of the cabin, then an aisle, the D, E, F and G seats in the middle, another aisle, and the H & K seats on the right.)

Towards the back of the rear cabin, the plane tapers to a point, and the centre block of four narrows to a block of three in the back four rows.

The seats themselves are much maligned because they 'tilt' forward rather than reclining: the back of the seat edges down and the bottom of the seat forward, rather than physically tilting the back of the seat.

While that sounds like a good idea in theory -- there's nobody reclining into your space -- it's much less comfortable, especially on the lower back.

Each seat has a decently sized screen in the headrest in front, plus a fold-down table. There's also the option to fold down a cup-holder instead of the table.

A power point is provided for every seat, behind the fold-down tray table.

The best seats on the plane

54A 54C 54H 54K: probably the best economy seats on the plane, these window + aisle exit row pairs are excellent, with nearly unlimited legroom. The table and entertainment screen are in the armrests, though, which makes the seat slightly narrower. Bear in mind also that the centre four seats are bassinet crib positions for infants, so bring your earplugs. Also, exit row seats like these can be draughty, so dress warmly if you're prone to feeling cold in the air.

30A 30C 30H 30K: these aisle + window bulkhead pairs give you extra room in front, although bear in mind that they're designated seats for the bassinet cribs too, so you're more likely to be moved to make way for an infant -- and much more likely to be kept awake by one too.

30D 30G: aisle seats at the very front of the first cabin, these let you stick your feet through the curtain in front of you (which separates business class from economy). You get nearly unlimited legroom as a result, but bear in mind that these, too, are bassinet crib seats.

30E 30F 54D 54E 54F 54G: these bulkhead seats give you extra room in front. The same caveats about slightly reduced seat width and bassinet crib seats apply here too.

66D 66G: these aisle seats are the first to be in a trio rather than a foursome at the back of the plane. That means you get extra underseat storage, can angle your legs sideways, and are less likely to be bumped into. On the downside, it'll take longer to get off the plane and through customs, while big fans of watching in-flight entertainment won't appreciate that the screens aren't directly in front of the seats.

The worst seats on the plane

33A 33K: on some versions of the A330, these ""window"" seats are missing the window, so avoid them unless it's a night flight and all you want to do is lean against the wall and sleep.

The last row in each cabin: although the seat numbers differ, the last row in each cabin have reduced legroom and are close to the loos. So if you're allocated a seat or handed a boarding pass with rows 40, 41, 46, 69 or 70, watch out -- and ask to see the seat map to make sure that you're not stuck at the back of the plane.
