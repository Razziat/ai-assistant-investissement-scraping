After French aviation manufacturer Airbus won a tense battle against Boeing for the business of Japan's second largest airline last year, the firm's chief financial officer told CNBC Airbus was just ""better."" Japan Airlines announced its first jet order for the French aircraft manufacturer in October for 31 A350 aircraft worth $9.5 billion, breaking into an aviation market which had been dominated by rival Boeing. (Read more: Airbus CEO defends outlook, ramps up A320 production) ""We needed a successor to our largest aircraft, the 777. When we compared what both Boeing and Airbus had to offer, Airbus was better,"" managing executive officer of finance & accounting Norikazu Saito told CNBC. ""It may have been a disappointment to Boeing, but they of course understand that business is business.""

Saito told CNBC that the biggest payoff from working with Airbus would be increased economic efficiency, although there would be some complications with owning two different brands of aircraft. ""Pilots need to have different licenses; you need to have spare parts for both manufacturers. But even taking all those things into account, Airbus was the better choice,"" he said. JAL faced some negative publicity earlier in the year when it temporarily grounded one of its Boeing 787 Dreamliners at Tokyo's Narita International Airport in mid-January, after white smoke was spotted outside the plane and a battery cell showed clear signs of leaking. (Read more: Airbus heading back to number 1 in deliveries: CEO)

The incident stoked fresh fears about the safety and reliability of the 787 model one year after the global Dreamliner fleet was grounded by regulators following the overheating of two such batteries. Saito told CNBC the matter was still under investigation. ""Fortunately, compared to last year - when the batteries heated up so much that it was virtually impossible to look inside them - this time the batteries are intact. That allows us to conduct a very detailed investigation,"" he told CNBC.

Air Force One Back In Budget; Airbus Unlikely To Bid - Breaking Defense,"Fri, 07 Mar 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vYnJlYWtpbmdkZWZlbnNlLmNvbS8yMDE0LzAzL2Fpci1mb3JjZS1vbmUtYmFjay1pbi1idWRnZXQtYWlyYnVzLXVubGlrZWx5LXRvLWJpZC_SAV5odHRwczovL2JyZWFraW5nZGVmZW5zZS5jb20vMjAxNC8wMy9haXItZm9yY2Utb25lLWJhY2staW4tYnVkZ2V0LWFpcmJ1cy11bmxpa2VseS10by1iaWQvP2FtcD0x?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"UPDATED: Adds FYDP Budget Plans To Spend $1.65 Billion On New Air Force One

WASHINGTON: Airbus, Boeing’s only likely competitor, probably won’t bid on the new Air Force One even though the Presidential Aircraft Replacement program has reappeared in the 2015 budget.

“Airbus could put together a dramatic candidate for Air Force One,” Allan McArtor, the new CEO of Airbus subsidiary Airbus Americas, told reporters at breakfast today when asked by my colleague Steve Trimble. But, and it was a very large but, the prestigious but highly complex aircraft (special engines, MANPAD protection, EMP hardening, National Command Authority communications etc. etc.) presents “a tough business case” as it would require a “tremendous amount of modifications” to a very small fleet.

While McArtor didn’t say no, he did say he “would find it unlikely” that Airbus would bid on the program. That would, of course appear to put incumbent Boeing squarely in the catbird seat.

The VC-25, as Air Force One is known, will hit the end of its planned 30-year operational life in 2017. While the aircraft are unlikely to start falling apart by then, the date does serve as a benchmark. An industry day was held Dec. 11 and 12 last year.

One analyst who has closely watched the Pentagon’s recent and so far hapless efforts to build presidential aircraft says, “there is no chance at all that Airbus will provide a future presidential aircraft,” consultant Loren Thompson said in an email. “First, its planes are technically inferior to Boeing’s. Second, the level of secrecy precludes foreign participation. Third, the politics are impossible.”

There’s not a lot of money in the 2015 request that I can find — $11 million — but we’ve pinged the Air Force to get the full extent of the funding across the five years of the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP). The new planes wouldn’t be delivered until after 2021, at the earliest. The entire program will probably be worth north of a billion dollars, if previous estimates are any guide. UPDATE: The Air Force plans to spend $1.65 billion over the FYDP, according to numbers they supplied March 11. The breakdown is:

FY15: $11.006

FY16: $103.302

FY17: $490.794

FY18: $518.092

FY19: $527.951

That’s a significant increase over last year’s plans, which called for spending $1.14 billion through fiscal 2018. Of course, the serious money is all in the out years, which to Washington insiders means it’s magic money for now. UPDATE ends.

For those who can remember all the way back to the Northrop Grumman-EADS (now Airbus) bid against Boeing for the airborne tanker, the poisonous politics of Buy America rhetoric (check the percentages of foreign content of most Boeing airplanes if you want to get some perspective) will be all too fresh in your memory.

But there appears to be a wrinkle here. I understand the Air Force is weighing a new acquisition strategy, one that would allow a company to buy a commercial plane and then modify it instead of building the plane from scratch. The P-8 might be a good example.

But Thompson is, to put it mildly, skeptical whether that would bring in anyone else to partner with Airbus. “If Airbus is foolish enough to bid with some hapless U.S. partner, it will merely repeat the role it played in the tanker competition of driving down the price of Boeing’s winning bid,” he says."
"Japan's ANA orders jets worth $17B from Airbus, Boeing - CBS News","Thu, 27 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvamFwYW5zLWFuYS1vcmRlcnMtamV0cy13b3J0aC0xN2ItZnJvbS1haXJidXMtYm9laW5nL9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2phcGFucy1hbmEtb3JkZXJzLWpldHMtd29ydGgtMTdiLWZyb20tYWlyYnVzLWJvZWluZy8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TOKYO - ANA is ordering 70 aircraft with a list price of $17 billion from Boeing Co. (BA) and Airbus, in the largest order in the Japanese carrier's history.

Thursday's orders underline ANA's ambition to become one of the world's leading airlines as well as Japan's tourism drive leading up to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The country is aiming to boost overseas visitors to 20 million a year.

Boeing is the major beneficiary of the deal, but Airbus said the latest orders show it is making inroads in an important market. The Japanese government and manufacturers have historically had a close relationship with Boeing, and Europe's Airbus did not score a major order with ANA rival Japan Airlines until last year.

The jets, being delivered over 11 years from 2016, will increase the ANA fleet to 250 aircraft.

From Boeing, ANA is ordering 40 aircraft including 14 of its 787-9 Dreamliner.

The 787 was grounded last year while the plane's safety was checked for battery problems.

Also among the Boeing orders are 20 777-9X, a twin-aisle aircraft with 15 percent more seating capacity than the current 777-300ER aircraft.

ANA will also purchase six 777-300ER jets to support the expansion of its international services until the newer model arrive.

From Airbus, ANA is ordering 30 single-aisle jets from the A320 family made up of seven A320neo aircraft and 23 A321neo aircraft.

ANA said the 40 new Boeing jets will be used mostly for international flights, while Airbus planes will be for domestic routes.

""These new aircraft will give us maximum flexibility and improved fuel efficiency and will allow us to meet the growth in demand, both internationally and in our domestic Japanese market,"" said ANA Holdings President and Chief Executive Shinichiro Ito.

ANA's business has recovered along with the recent Japanese economic revival, but the weakening yen has weighed on its operations by making fuel purchases more expensive.

Boeing welcomed its orders, which total about $13 billion at list prices."
Comlux balances Airbus and Boeing VIP completions - Corporate Jet Investor,"Mon, 03 Mar 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvcnBvcmF0ZWpldGludmVzdG9yLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NvbWx1eC1iYWxhbmNlcy1haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLXZpcC1jb21wbGV0aW9ucy04MDUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Comlux balances Airbus and Boeing VIP completions

news by CJI Expert March 3, 2014 Print this page

Specialising in Airbus and Boeing VIP completions, Comlux has adapted its business model so many times, it is truly a chameleon of private aviation.

Comlux Aviation is an all-encompassing private aviation brand and one of the few companies that can handle an aircraft from “cradle to grave,” as David Edinger, president and CEO of Comlux America, puts it.

MUST READ: Flying by BBJ: From pizza ovens to putting greens

By this, Edinger means that Comlux can arrange the delivery and acceptance of an aircraft – either green (unfurnished) or outfitted – at short notice, it can design and build an aircraft’s interior, arrange crew and catering, make the aircraft available for charter and take responsibility for maintenance and CAMO.

Founded in Zurich in 2003 as an aircraft management company and charter operator, Comlux added its first VIP corporate airliner – an Airbus ACJ319 – to its fleet in 2004 and another in 2005.



Comlux The Aviation Group

Comlux The Aviation Group, as it exists today, began to take shape in 2007 and now includes a VIP airline with 15 aircraft available for charter, Air Operator’s Certificates in Malta and Aruba and a collection of sales offices stretching from Bahrain to Hong Kong.

Edinger says the company is able to benefit through the cooperation and occasional overlap of its different departments, while maintaining the “Swiss quality” of its spiritual home and continued headquarters.

“We had a Head of State client recently that brought their aircraft in for maintenance,” says Edinger. “We chartered an aircraft for them to use in the meantime and it now looks like they’re going to buy it. We’ll also refurbish it and take care of maintenance.”



Comlux America

In the US, Comlux is split into two main parts. Comlux Aviation Services offers maintenance and refurbishments across a range of business jets, whilst Comlux America handles completions for green narrowbody airliners and increasingly, for widebody models. Last year, Comlux America delivered three outfitted aircraft and it expects the same total for 2014.

At the heart of Comlux America is an ultra-modern, purpose-built facility in Indianapolis, Indiana, which is the first centre in the world to include every part of the aircraft completions chain under one roof.

At the time of speaking, one ACJ and one BBJ are undergoing maintenance as two ACJs and another BBJ sit inside of Comlux’s completion facility. “I built the hangar to handle four completions at the same time,” says Edinger.

Depending on the type, it takes 12-16 months to fit a green aircraft – delivered straight from the manufacturer’s assembly line – with a fresh interior and all the state-of-the-art features that a Comlux client demands.



Business and pleasure

Comlux tends works with heads-of-state and corporations, but mainly with high-net-worth individuals, who use their aircraft for a mix of business and personal use.

“They’ve had smaller business jets and now they’re moving up the food chain,” says Edinger. “They want room for the kids and grandparents.”

These aircraft are typically used to fly small families, who like to ability to fill up the aircraft on special occasions. Before joining Comlux, Edinger says he also worked on two completions projects for basketball teams.

Most corporate airliner owners will configure their aircraft for a maximum of 17 passengers as a way of avoiding more stringent charter restrictions. Edinger says that around half of Comlux’s clients elect to make their aircraft available for third party charter in order to recoup some of the operating costs.

In terms of regions, the company gets most of its business from the Middle East, China, Russia and increasingly, India.



Airbus vs Boeing

Edinger says the aircraft which enter Comlux’s completions centre are split evenly between Airbus Corporate Jets and Boeing Business Jets.

Comlux America is one of eight outfitters in the world to have been audited by Airbus and is also part of Boeing’s global network of 17 authorised completions centres. To pass the auditing process, a completion centre must show that it meets the manufacturer’s meticulous standards for cleanliness and can provide 24/7 support if it receives a phone call from a client.

“I used to work for Airbus,” says Edinger, as he recalls with amusement the arrival of Airbus’ auditors to Indiana. “I knew the answers to the test questions. It normally takes two or three visits, but we did it in one.”

Edinger explains that whereas Boeing will simply recommend Comlux to its customers, Airbus takes a more hands-on approach to completion projects. “When Airbus recommends us, what there are doing is a turn-key,” he says. “They have a project management team; someone comes every six weeks.”



Narrow-body deliveries slow down

Although being an Airbus-audited facility boosts Comlux’s credentials considerably, Edingers admits that the company has never actually won a turn-key completion contract from the European manufacturer.

“We started this business at the same time that the bottom fell out,” says Edinger, who goes on to link the decline in business jet deliveries with the notoriety that surrounded the CEOs of GM, Ford and Chrysler flying to the Washington bankruptcy courts on their private jets in 2008. “It became really difficult. Corporations stopped flying their business jets and it got really tight,” Edinger adds. “We changed our business model immediately and brought in our first A320.”

Now, Edinger says the narrow-body segment is starting to feel the crunch, as business jets become socially acceptable again. “Airbus and Boeing have really slowed down on their deliveries,” he says.



Modern luxuries

Once again, Comlux has had to adapt its business model and it is now focusing on older ACJs and BBJs with maintenance inspections looming. Conveniently, these aircraft also tend to be owned by high-net-worth individuals and corporations who now desire the same modern luxuries that they would expect at home, like Wi-Fi, streaming video and live television – although the latter option can be extremely expensive.

Edinger also talks about features such as slouching divans and individual tables which deploy into one, all of which add a personalised touch to the aircraft interior.

“Everybody wants the quietest cabin,” says Edinger. “They all want something different.”"
Airbus Helicopters highlights its strong footprint in Latin America at Chile's FIDAE Fair - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 24 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1c2hlbGljb3B0ZXJzaGlnaGxpZ2h0c2l0c3N0cm9uZ2Zvb3RwcmludGlubGF0aW5hbWVyaWNhYS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For the first time in Latin America under its new branding, Airbus Helicopters will display its efficient and adapted product line-up at this week’s FIDAE International Air and Space Fair, featuring rotorcraft flown by a cross-section of Latin American operators to underscore the company’s leadership in this portion of the world.

Maintaining an overall 40 percent market share in Latin America during the past five years with a deployed fleet of more than 1,350 rotorcraft across the region, Airbus Helicopters has developed a diversified customer base, as well as a strong industrial presence – with 1,200 employees assigned to its subsidiaries in Brazil, Chile and Mexico for production, maintenance and support.

Airbus Helicopters’ 12 different rotorcraft types position the company as the only manufacturer covering Latin America’s full operational requirements, from lightweight to heavy-lift; with designed-in performance for duties in the region’s unique conditions, from jungle and hot environments to high altitudes in the Andes.

The product line’s versatility and efficiency is underscored by Airbus Helicopters’ Ecureuil family: more than 600 are in service across the region, having logged over 130,000 flight hours in missions that include passenger transport, mining support, power line maintenance, fire-fighting and the transportation of external loads.

Exhibited at FIDAE will be a utility-configured single-engine AS350 B3 Ecureuil from a Chile based aerial services operator that specializes in mining and energy, construction, civil work, extreme sports, tourism and filming.

Other lightweight helicopters on display at FIDAE are the EC120 and the EC130 T2 – the latter being the first of this type to arrive in the South Cone. Retaining the EC130 helicopter’s external lines, this latest Ecureuil family member benefits from Airbus Helicopters’ continued investment in its products – with approximately 70 percent of the EC130 T2’s airframe structure modified. New features include a more powerful Arriel 2D turboshaft engine and upgraded main gearbox; along with a cabin interior structure redesign and a cockpit update for enhanced man-machine interface.

The EC145, also showcased at FIDAE, is one of the most popular light twin-engine helicopter models, and is relied on around the globe for public security and disaster relief missions. With more than 500 delivered to date, this helicopter serves in the police fleets of 26 countries worldwide. Powerful, versatile and perfectly suited to the region’s terrain, the EC145 has become a reference for public services missions in Latin America, where it is being operated by the public services of Argentina, Brazil, Mexico – and more recently Bolivia and Peru, with recent purchases for four and five aircraft, respectively.

The Dauphin family’s EC155 B1 arrives in the region to set new standards for private aviation in terms of style and comfort. Presenting the biggest cabin in its class, the EC155 B1 offers a unique combination of elegance, comfort, silence and speed and, it is well position for the growing trend among private operators for large-cabin helicopters. High-end options include soft leather club seats, power sources for laptops, adjustable reading lights, cabin air conditioning, as well as satellite communications and in-flight entertainment for an exclusive flight experience.

Completing Airbus Helicopters’ flight-line presence at FIDAE is the latest Cougar family member: the AS532 ALe version of the workhorse Super Puma family that incorporates the EC225 version’s glass cockpit and four-axis autopilot. Of the 870 Super Puma/Cougar helicopters delivered to date, more than 100 are in service in Latin America, with 60 others on order. Most of the continent’s armed forces are operating this family for a wide variety of missions that range from assault and combat to special operations, tactical transport, SAR, medical evacuation and the transport of high-ranking officials.

The Cougar family is present in Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Venezuela – with Airbus Helicopters’ Helibras subsidiary in Brazil producing the EC725 version for the Brazilian Armed Forces.

Airbus Helicopters’ participation in this year’s FIDAE is the company’s first at the biennial show in its new branding, underscoring its commitment toward customer satisfaction, quality, safety and competitiveness."
"Airbus A-400M ""Grizzly"" crosswind testing at Keflavik International Airport - The Aviationist","Tue, 25 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlYXZpYXRpb25pc3QuY29tLzIwMTQvMDMvMjUvYTQwMG0tY3Jvc3N3aW5kLXRlc3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On Feb. 19, an Airbus A-400M “Grizzly” testplane made a quick visit to Keflavik International Airport to perform multiple crosswing landings. The Aviationist reporter Eggert Norðdahl was there to take the following pictures of the testing activity.

The Airbus A-400M registration F-WWMZ (c/n. 006), arrived just after daylight (in the morning) and performed multiple crosswind landings followed by taxi back and take-off from RWY 20. During the activities the tactical airlifter was observed performing approaches of approx. 30 degrees of crab, for incredibly short-landing rolls.

Noteworthy, Keflavik had winds from 080 degrees, at 30 knots, with gusting up to 47 knots.

Image credit: screenshot from FR24.com

This “crosswind storm” knocked down a brand new GSM Tele-Communication mast at the Keflavík Ásbrú district (at the old US Naval Station Keflavík Military area) – and Swedish JAS-39 Gripen and Finnish F/A-18 fighter jets (involved in IAM-2014) temporarily based at the airport were forced to cancel their sorties.

Only a few Norwegian “Shark” aircraft (F-16s) (as wel as a Dutch KDC-10 tanker) took off to perform their “Iceland Air Policing” mission.

The Airbus Grizzly also performed four landings on RWY 11 (into the wind) then pulled in for fuel-stop (and Customs checks) and perhaps a little rest. Later on the same day it took off again and finally daparted back for Europe.

It was last noted at FL310 heading for Toulouse at 18:36 hrs.

Previous aircraft types doing crosswind tests at Keflavik during the last decades were the B-777, A-380, B-787 (twice), B-747i and Sukhoi 100-95 (the latter left Iceland on Dec. 28, 2013, after performing a gear up landing on Jul. 21, 2013).

SaudiGulf to buy four Airbus A320s - RFI English,"Mon, 17 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJmaS5mci9lbi9lY29ub215LzIwMTQwMzE3LXNhdWRpZ3VsZi1idXktZm91ci1haXJidXMtYTMyMHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"France - Saudi Arabia

The European aviation consortium Airbus has announced that the new Saudi Arabian company, SaudiGulf, has ordered four A320s.

The order is worth around 375 million dollars and the aircraft will be delivered at the beginning of 2015.

SaudiGulf is one of the two companies which has a licence to serve Saudian airports.

The company is a subsidiary of the Abdul Hadi Al Qahtani group and hopes to start operating early in 2015 out of Dammam, near Qatar. It aims then to extend to Jeddah and Riyadh.

“The A320 is the ideal aircraft for our company, offering a perfect combination in terms of performance, technical standards, adaptability and cost effectiveness, as well as a very high level of comfort for passengers”, said group president Tariq Abdel Hadi Al Qahtani.

The four aircraft will be equipped with “sharklets”, which are fin-like features which help reduce carbon consummation by around four per cent.

The A320, built near Toulouse in Southwestern France, is the second biggest selling aircraft in the world after the Boeing 737.

Meanwhile Saudi Arabia is now France’s top business partner in the Middle East. France imports Saudi Arabian oil but also exports a growing number of products to the Gulf state.

Airplane manufacturer Airbus has come up with an answer: jam an 11th seat into economy-class rows of the A380, the world’s largest passenger jet, for a 3-5-3 seat configuration.

According to Flightglobal, an aviation website, a mock-up of this new 11-abreast seat configuration will be shown at an aircraft interiors trade show in April. The website reports that an aircraft leasing company is eager to get it into the hands of airlines worldwide.

Being boxed in a middle seat by four people is seemingly not the future air travelers were promised when the A380 was announced in 2000. Back then, the giant plane — according to Airbus, it has enough room to seat about 525 passengers in a “comfortable three-class configuration,” though actual configurations vary — was expected to usher in a new era of airborne luxury, the likes of which hadn’t been seen since the mid-20th century’s so-called “golden age” of air travel.

In its March 2001 issue, for example, Popular Mechanics, a reliable tribune for future-hype, published a cover story with the headline “Hotels in the Sky.” It explained:

“Stop at the bar for a couple of beers, then work them off in the gym. Shave, shower and meet the wife at her health spa. Tag along while she shops. Have a gourmet dinner, then light up a Cuban cigar and sip cognac at a small piano bar. Log 8 hours in the sack, eat a leisurely breakfast and collect the kids and Rover. Then move your seat to the full upright position, because this hasn’t been a getaway weekend. You’ve flown from New York to Sydney aboard the Airbus A380, the world’s first flying hotel.”

That wasn’t all. In December 2000, Wired ran an Associated Press article with the headline “The Casino in the Sky,” which suggested the possibility of bars and gambling. As recently as 2007, Virgin Atlantic’s Richard Branson was promising “roulette and blackjack” which — in addition to double beds — Branson proclaimed in 2005, could provide passengers with “two ways of getting lucky.”

By the time the marketers were finished, it seemed the only thing a spacious A380 cabin would lack was a dance floor and mirror ball. Reality, however, was much more dull. Casinos haven’t materialized, and though some A380s have bars and you may be able to walk around the duty-free shop on your Korean Air flight, from a passenger perspective what distinguishes the A380 interior is little more than size and a quiet environment.

So how did Airbus go from offering a futurist’s dream of airline paradise, to possibly a frequent flier’s nightmare? In part, the A380 was designed for a regulated hub-and-spoke model of running an airline — fly big planes long distances and little ones short distances — that’s increasingly out of favor in a world where deregulation allows more airlines to fly more places on fuel-efficient midsize planes that carry fewer passengers. If you’re trying to get from Shanghai to Seattle, you can now simply go directly with about 200 other passengers on a Boeing plane (via Delta). Indeed, Boeing — Airbus’ great rival — makes planes, including the slick, smaller 787 Dreamliner, designed for precisely that kind of point-to-point aviation universe.

The proof is in the results. Airbus initially aimed for 750 total orders for the A380. At the end of 2013, it had just over 300 total orders. Almost half of those were made by Dubai-based Emirates, which runs a successful hub-and-spoke business shuttling passengers between major airports around the world, and delivering them to Dubai, where they transfer — often to other A380s. And that’s largely a volume business, not a luxury one.

The 3-5-3 seating configuration has only just become an option, and so it’s unlikely to land at your local hub any time soon. But fliers shouldn’t rest easy. According to Bloomberg Businessweek, the British leasing company that purchased 20 planes earlier this year (and pushed for the 3-5-3 seating configuration) has suggested that the A380 should operate with about 630 seats for increased efficiency. If that comes to pass, the likelihood of being stuck in an uncomfortable middle seat — including one jammed between four other seats — just went up."

There are some immediate things that jump out and excite me beyond the hard statistics. The colors and branding fit right in with the overall Qatar Airways color palette. Many airlines, to their detriment, completely lose all branding in their premium cabin and begin to focus on creating an atmosphere that attempts to soothe the passenger away.

There are some airlines that even make their premium cabins look like hospitals covered in billboards… but I won’t mention names. It looks as if Qatar Airways has decided to create an elegant, welcoming living room-like atmosphere without losing their identity as an airline inside. As an aircraft interiors geek, I find this exciting.

Featuring a shocking ninety-inch seat pitch, yes ninety inches, and a twenty-six inch HD monitor, this seat is ready to wow.

Qatar Airways will inaugurate the A380 on services between the brand-new Hamad International airport in Doha and London Heathrow later this year.

All Nippon Airways Splits $16.6 Billion Aircraft Order - The New York Times,"Thu, 27 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTQvMDMvMjgvYnVzaW5lc3MvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9haXJidXMtYW5kLWJvZWluZy10by1zaGFyZS0xNi02LWJpbGxpb24tb3JkZXItZnJvbS1hbmEuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing and Airbus each won something to brag about in their latest face-off, as All Nippon Airways of Japan said on Thursday that it would split a $16.6 billion order between the two plane makers.

Boeing won about 80 percent of the order based on value and kept Airbus from encroaching further on its sales of large wide-body jets. But Airbus received orders for smaller planes and continued to make inroads in a country where Boeing had long been dominant.

All Nippon’s purchases came just over six months after another carrier, Japan Airlines, shook the industry by ordering $9.5 billion of Airbus’s new A350 wide-body jets. While Boeing and Airbus compete fiercely in most countries, Japan had been almost a captive buyer of American planes since its reconstruction after World War II.

All Nippon’s order included 40 of Boeing’s wide-body planes — 20 777-9X models, 14 787-9 models and six 777-300ER models — to be delivered between fiscal 2017 and 2027."
"Rolls-Royce plans for new single-aisle, twin-aisle airplane engines - Leeham News and Analysis","Mon, 10 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNC8wMy8xMC9yb2xscy1yb3ljZS1wbGFucy1mb3ItbmV3LXNpbmdsZS1haXNsZS10d2luLWFpc2xlLWFpcnBsYW5lLWVuZ2luZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rolls-Royce may not be at a cross road but it’s certainly at a fork in the road.

RR sought to be a dual-source supplier for the Boeing 777X, competing with GE Aviation for the privilege; it was generally a given that GE would be a provider. The question was whether it would be the sole supplier or share the platform with another. Pratt & Whitney withdrew, concluding the business case wasn’t there for its proposed big Geared Turbo Fan. RR stayed in the competition, assured by Boeing that it wasn’t a stalking horse to GE.

But GE won the position as exclusive supplier, much to RR’s consternation.

Next, the future of the Airbus A350-800, powered exclusively by RR, is in serious doubt. The backlog is now down to a mere 46 as customer after customer, encouraged by Airbus, up-gauged to the A350-900 and -1000 sub-types. While RR is also the exclusive supplier on each of these models, and the engines are largely common, there has been substantial investment by Rolls on the -800’s application. If the -800 is canceled (as many industry observers believe it will be), RR’s investment is largely down the drain. How does Airbus “make good” to RR for this?

There is the prospect of choosing RR to be the sole supplier on the prospective A330neo. While a re-engined A330 is envisioned with an entry-into-service of 2018 and therefore only the GEnx and the Trent 1000 TEN are the feasible options, selecting the Trent would compensate RR for a canceled A350-800.

Exclusively selecting RR to power an A380neo, with an EIS of around 2020 or somewhat later, could also accomplish this. The engine OEMs believe the potential market for an A380neo is 300-400. This means 1,200-1,600 engines plus spares, parts and Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul contracts. Today’s A380 shares the power between the RR Trent 900 and the Engine Alliance GP7200; Airbus forecast 650 sales of today’s A380, according to a lawsuit between RR and PW a few years ago. Engine Alliance, a joint venture of PW and GE, dominates the market share thanks to Emirates Airlines selecting the GP7200 to power 90 A380s. But Emirates’ recent order for 50 more left the engine selection open, and its president wants future engines to provide a 10% reduction in fuel burn. The timing of many of the deliveries means the current generation of engines will power at least some of the 50. But some of them could be powered by a new generation.

This brings us to the fork in the road facing RR. Last month, Rolls announced its development plans for a new big engine and another that will compete for the next generation New Small Airplane.

Advance for 2020

The next opportunity is six years away and requires an evolutionary solution. With the A380neo and A350-1100 being the only near-term realistic projects, an engine that can match/supersede GE’s GE9X with a low risk is what is required. Here the architecture diagram for this new triple-shaft as given by Rolls-Royce, with our conclusions:

Diagram 1: Advance architecture and key data based on Rolls-Royce material.

The Advance uses the results from Rolls-Royce’s EU-sponsored technology programs. The CFRP fan concept comes from its developments with GKN and the new compressor/turbine designs are from the different EU ACARE programs. The result is a modest risk program which will fly its CFRP fan demonstrator next year based on a TXWB core.

Ultrafan

The Ultrafan is a logical further development of the variable pitch geared turbofan Rolls-Royce worked on 45 years ago. It was a variant of the RR-Snecma M45H (WFV-Fokker 614). Here is the Ultrafan’s architecture diagram:

Diagram 2: Ultrafan architecture and key data based on Rolls-Royce materials.

The variable pitch fan improves the efficiency but also does away with the need for a variable fan nozzle area nacelle and thrust reverser. Rolls-Royce thereby plans to compete with PW’s future offering with a lighter engine matching or exceeding the efficiency of the then contemporary PW GTF.

Having been cut out of the 777X program, having withdrawn from the International Aero Engines V2500 A320ceo partnership and facing an uncertain future of the A350-800, RR is embarking on a new path to expand its wide-body power plants and to return to the single-aisle market.

Neither PW nor GE/CFM will give RR a free path to these market sectors. These will be subjects of future analysis.

China in talks with Airbus on possible $20 billion aircraft deal - CNBC,"Wed, 19 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTQvMDMvMTkvY2hpbmEtaW4tdGFsa3Mtd2l0aC1haXJidXMtb24tcG9zc2libGUtMjAtYmlsbGlvbi1haXJjcmFmdC1kZWFsLmh0bWzSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAxNC8wMy8xOS9jaGluYS1pbi10YWxrcy13aXRoLWFpcmJ1cy1vbi1wb3NzaWJsZS0yMC1iaWxsaW9uLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWRlYWwuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"China is in talks to buy at least 150 Airbus passenger jets potentially worth $20 billion when Xi Jinping pays his first visit to Europe as president at the end of this month, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. In a broad-ranging deal that could help reset trade relations between China and Europe after a bumpy year, China is expected to buy more A330 passenger jets as talks advance to open Airbus's second major factory in the country.

The ""cabin completion"" plant for A330s would bolster Airbus's presence five years after the opening of its first final assembly plant outside Europe in the Chinese port city of Tianjin, where Chinese workers put together A320 jets. The deal could also involve a decision to unfreeze the purchase of 27 A330s blocked by China during a recent row with the European Union over environmental policies.

A spokesman for Airbus, a subsidiary of Airbus Group , previously known as EADS, declined to comment. Chinese government officials were not immediately available to comment and spokespeople for major Chinese airlines including Air China , China Eastern and China Southern all declined to comment. Both France and Germany are anxious to establish good ties with China's leader and announcements on the Airbus deal package of could be made in both countries, European officials said. The package could also include some A320 and A350 aircraft, people familiar with the matter said. (Read more: Airbus heading back to number 1 in deliveries: CEO)

The sources stressed, however, that the final size of the deal could change and would depend on last-minute talks. Previous state visits have included tough negotiations on the sidelines.

Onboard Systems is awarded EC130 T2 cargo hook system by Airbus Helicopters - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 31 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL29uYm9hcmRzeXN0ZW1zaXNhd2FyZGVkZWMxMzB0MmNhcmdvaG9va3N5c3RlbWJ5YWlyYnVzaGVsaWNvcC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Onboard Systems International, Inc., a leading provider of innovative helicopter cargo hook equipment, announced that it has been awarded a contract from Airbus Helicopters to design and manufacture the cargo hook system for the EC130 T2 aircraft. The new system will be a single-point hydraulic release cargo hook sling design featuring a TALON cargo hook and an integrated Onboard Weighing System.

When completed, Onboard’s EC130T2 cargo hook system will weigh about 4kg (9lb) and will be available exclusively through Airbus Helicopters. The new EC130 T2 cargo hook system is compatible with the crash resistance requirements to which the fuel system of the EC130 T2 complies (27.952). The compact design preserves ground clearance and includes a built-in stowage mechanism. As with all TALON cargo hooks, in emergency load situations it can release up to 2.5 times the rated load of 1,500 KG.

The TALON LC Hydraulic Cargo Hook offers a hydraulically activated secondary release system with lines that can be routed with the electrical control cables instead of a separate loop and path for greater safety. The result is a cleaner installation that reduces the possibility of snagging the line, which is manufactured from braided stainless steel for maximum durability. To further protect the cables, hook and fuselage, the cargo hook system includes travel stops. Finally, the integrated Onboard Weighing System includes a cockpit indicator to show the pilot the precise weight of each load, increasing safety and productivity."

Europe’s biggest aerospace manufacturer, Airbus Group, plans to drop its scale-model prototype prototype Spaceplane from an altitude of 10,000 feet (3,048 meters) over Singapore in May. If that trial goes well, another unpowered drop test — this time from 100,000 feet (30,480 m) — should follow next year, officials said. You can see concept photos of the European space plane here.

In 2007, the European company EADS (the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company, now called Airbus) revealed that it had worked for two years on what it called a ""space jet"". The suborbital craft looked like a business jet, would take off like an airplane and, once it reached 39,000 feet (11,887 m), would use a rocket motor to power its four passengers and one pilot to 196,000 feet (59,741 m). [Space Planes: Evolution of the Winged Spaceship (Infographic)]

The space jet would then coast to above 62 miles (100 kilometers), the generally accepted boundary between air and space. The vehicle would use cold gas reaction control system jets to orient itself for atmospheric re-entry.

The company stated in 2007 that the project would cost 1 billion euros ($1.37 billion at current exchange rates), and that it was seeking private investors. At the time, seat prices were expected to be at least $200,000, but EADS had no intention of being an operator. Rather, it would sell the spacecraft to tourism companies.

Drop tests coming

After years of saying nothing about the project, Airbus has revealed that this May a helicopter will hoist the scale model — which at 15 feet (4.6 m) long is one-quarter the size of the actual Spaceplane) — to about 10,000 feet, at which point it will be dropped. The vehicle will be remotely controlled for a sea landing east of Singapore in the South China Sea.

Christophe Chavagnac, Spaceplane programs manager and chief engineer at Airbus’ Defence and Space division, spoke exclusively to Space.com about the project.

""This first one [test], it will be remotely controlled from the ground,"" he said. ""What we are looking for is to validate the Spaceplane itself, and the Spaceplane itself is in a gliding mode.""

The flight profile revealed in 2007 described the vehicle reaching its 62-mile apogee, re-entering Earth's atmosphere and then gliding to a point where it could restart its two turbofan engines and make a powered return to its takeoff runway.

Chavagnac qualified the date of the 10,000-foot drop test, adding that it could take place in ""the middle of the year"" if the May target falls through. He also explained that the remote control ""will be like a UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle]."" [How Unmanned Drone Aircraft Work (Infographic)]

Spaceplane’s design has two turbofan engines, located on either side of the rear of the fuselage, like a business jet. These engines power the first part of its ascent before the vehicle's rocket motor is ignited. This is unchanged from the 2007 design, as is the rocket motor, which is being designed by Airbus Defence and Space and uses a combination of oxygen and methane.

Changes to the suborbital Spaceplane design since 2007 include the removal of its canard, a small winglike structure on its nose, that can aid lift on takeoff and help with in-flight maneuvering. For Spaceplane, the canard was also designed to aid the atmospheric re-entry. The exact re-entry and descent profile of Spaceplane has never been revealed, and Chavagnac declined to give Space.com flight profile details.

Spaceplane’s wing has also changed, with a slender design being replaced by a more conventional style. Chavagnac described the new Spaceplane design as looking ""heavily"" like French business jet manufacturer Dassault’s Falcon 7X.

He declined to say how much Airbus had spent on Spaceplane since 2007, but he did say that the May test would cost ""some millions of euros."" Asked how big the Spaceplane team is, he stated it was ""not a couple of people"" and ""not hundreds of people."" He added that the team includes people in Singapore as well as in Europe.

Prototype built

In 2012, Airbus signed a contract with Singapore firm Hope Technik, which has assembled the composite-material Spaceplane prototype. The vehicle was displayed at the Singapore Airshow, which took place Feb. 11-16.

Hope's engineers are now fitting the avionics and flight control systems to the quarter-scale prototype. The company's contract with Airbus will end with the May test, Chavagnac explained.

The same prototype will be used for the 2015 drop test from 100,000 feet, which will use a stratospheric balloon. For this test Chavagnac said, ""What we have to find now is a stratospheric balloon and a test range, which is not such an issue.""

Singapore, an island that is about 25 miles (40 km) long, is 1 mile (1.6 km) from the coast of Malaysia and about 50 miles (80 km) from one of the western islands of the Indonesian archipelago. This means the Spaceplane could fly into foreign airspace if the 100,000-foot drop does not go according to plan.

When announced in 2007, Airbus’ business case predicted that five space jets and 20 engines would be built every year, and that each vehicle would operate for 10 years with one flight a week. As well as tourists, Airbus expected to fly scientific and military missions. A seven-year development timetable was expected, which would lead to certification.

The European company also expected the operator of its Spaceplane to have won, within five years, 30 percent of the space tourism market that was predicted by the Futron Corporation to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

In 2007, the company talked about launching the project commercially in 2008 and said it had financiers interested in it, but then the financial crisis occurred. That year, the company publicly stated that work would slow on the Spaceplane. Since then, Airbus has been very quiet about its Spaceplane work, fueling speculation that the project had been dropped.

Airbus isn't the only company working on a suborbital space plane. Virgin Galactic and XCOR Aerospace, for example, may be flying their vehicles — known as SpaceShipTwo and Lynx, respectively — commercially within a year or so.

"Boeing, Airbus Working to Offset the Cons of All-Electric Propulsion - Via Satellite","Fri, 28 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhdGVsbGl0ZXRvZGF5LmNvbS9pbm5vdmF0aW9uLzIwMTQvMDMvMjgvYm9laW5nLWFpcmJ1cy13b3JraW5nLXRvLW9mZnNldC10aGUtY29ucy1vZi1hbGwtZWxlY3RyaWMtcHJvcHVsc2lvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"[Via Satellite 03-28-2014] Electric propulsion is by no means new to the satellite industry, but the last few years have seen a surge in interest as customers begin to consider and purchase all-electric satellites instead of just hybrid. Previously used only for station keeping so gravity and atmospheric drag don’t deorbit satellites prematurely, satellite operators are now using the technology to raise their spacecraft from transitional orbits to geostationary orbits as well. All-electric satellites, though they can be costlier, can weigh as little as half the amount of their chemically propelled counterparts, which is opening up new creative options for designers.

“There was a change in the market in recent years,” said Eric Béranger, head of space systems and programs at Airbus Defence and Space. “With the arrival of SpaceX, thanks to which in this category of weight … the combined cost of the satellite plus the launch service for the satellite to arrive in orbit suddenly is reduced. At the end of the day the reduction in the cost of launch is bigger than the extra cost of the electrical propulsion system.”

Airbus, with its Eurostar E3000 platform and Boeing with its 702SP platform, lead the industry in all-electric satellite design. Each is looking at different ways to further reduce the negatives associated with alternative propellant systems. The chief drawback for all-electric satellites is the time spent migrating from the launcher’s drop-off point to the final orbit — a task that only takes days with chemical propellants, but can take upwards of six to eight months with an all-electric system. Time spent in transitional orbits detracts from the amount of revenue operators can collect from their assets.

“For the operator, that can be a very high cost because they have all their money on the table,” explained Béranger. “They have paid all their capex, so the sooner they can generate revenues with their satellite in orbit, the better … [but] what matters for the operator is not so much the cost of the satellite on one side and the cost of the launcher on the other. It’s really the combination which is important.”

However, Bruce Chesley, vice president of business development at Boeing Space and Intelligence Systems, is not that concerned about the time from launch to in-orbit operation. “The time that is most important to the satellite operator is the time from contract award to the time they can operate their satellite. So with manufacturing efficiencies, we’ve driven down the manufacturing, integration and test time so that the total program time is very comparable — in the ballpark of 30 to 32 months from contract award to on orbit operations after orbit raising,” he said.

Boeing’s 702SP satellite bus uses a propellant system called the Xenon Ion Propulsion System (XIPS), which has a significantly higher efficient delta-v performance than hydrazine. XIPS has 10 times the specific impulse — think gas mileage — of traditional fuels, meaning it requires 10 times less fuel to launch and carry.

Airbus recently partnered with Snecma to integrate the company’s PPS5000 electric propulsion engine into Eurostar satellites for missions requiring positioning maneuvers. The company is working to optimize its Eurostar E3000 platform for all-electric with Snecma, as well as separately working on the European Space Agency’s (ESA’s) Neosat next generation platform for 2019.

“We are extremely happy to have chosen the Hall Effect Thruster ‘plasma’ technology,” said Béranger. “[First,] the operational feedback in orbit is extremely good, and second, this technology offers a higher level of thrust in orbit, which means you need less time to get to your geostationary orbit. Typically in some cases it can take as little as two to three months, which is a very significant advantage.”

Today, Airbus has seven hybrid satellites that use electric propulsion in orbit for station keeping, and three more being built. ABS 3A and Satmex 7, Boeing’s first two all-electric satellites, are scheduled to launch on SpaceX’s Falcon 9 in 2015. According to Chesley, Boeing is working on further streamlining the manufacturing process to shorten the production time of all-electric satellites.

“In rough numbers, we’re in the sub-27 to 29-month period,” he said. “And that’s the first time around. We have a lot of opportunities to drive that closer to 24 months, [which] is really where we are aiming … the other thing is the economics of the electric propulsion and the ability to dual launch is pretty compelling. People are willing to look at the bigger picture, and the orbit-raising time is not going to be a show-stopper because of these other advantages.”"

This milestone rotorcraft – presented during a delivery ceremony at Airbus Helicopters’ Donauwörth, Germany production facility – was provided to the military service’s 36 Combat Helicopter Regiment.

It completed the three batches of four Tiger UHT support helicopters modified to the ASGARD (Afghanistan Stabilization German Army Rapid Deployment) configuration through a program launched in late 2011 by Airbus Helicopters and the German Federal Ministry of Defense. The ASGARD conversion includes installation of engine sand filters and additional ballistic protection, along with the incorporation of a mission data recorder and enhanced communication equipment for multinational missions.

The German Armed Forces began deploying its initial Tiger UHTs modified to the ASGARD configuration in December 2012, with operations beginning a month later in Mazar-e-Scharif.

To date, these ASGARD-upgraded Tigers have accumulated well over 1,000 flight hours in German military service, demonstrating their high reliability, mission effectiveness, and a high level of acceptance during support missions.

“The Tiger ASGARD program is the result of a successful and close cooperation between Airbus Helicopters and the German Armed Forces,” said Wolfgang Schoder, the managing director of Airbus Helicopters in Germany. “Today’s milestone underscores our ability to develop and implement upgrades that meet specific army requirements in highly-demanding environments such as Afghanistan.”

The ASGARD retrofit was performed by Airbus Helicopters at its Donauwörth site, which also is home to the final assembly line for Germany’s Tiger UHT support helicopter versions.

Overall, Airbus Helicopters has delivered more than 100 Tigers in their various versions to the military services of Germany, France, Spain and Australia – accumulating more than 50,000 flight hours, including over 7,500 hours logged during military operations in Afghanistan, Libya, Mali and Somalia."

The airframer will show a mock-up of the new configuration at the Aircraft Interiors show in Hamburg in early April. However, the type’s only leasing customer Amedeo has already expressed an interest in becoming launch customer for the layout.

Speaking at the ISTAT Americas conference in San Diego, Amedeo chief executive Mark Lapidus said: “We pushed Airbus very hard to get 11-abreast introduced, [adding] 35 to 40 extra seats.”

Lapidus said the new layout would be made possible through “raising the floor by two inches in the wider part of the aircraft”.

Airbus

The lessor has yet to secure a customer for any of the 20 A380s it has on firm order, but says it would be “very excited” to have the 11-abreast configuration in all its aircraft. However, it acknowledges that this would be driven by airline demands.

Based on a three-class layout with business and premium-economy cabins on the upper deck, Amedeo says an overall density of around 630-650 passengers could be achieved through use of the new 11-abreast seating.

Lapidus has previously been critical of Airbus’s former marketing strategy for the superjumbo, arguing that too much emphasis was placed on selling it as a “luxury” aircraft, ignoring the type’s potential seat-mile economics.

Deliveries of the lessor’s A380s from its $8.3 billion order are scheduled to begin in 2016.

Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia CNN —

A Malaysia Airlines flight to South Korea made an emergency landing in Hong Kong early Monday after its main electrical generator stopped working, the airline said.

The plane, an Airbus A330-300, landed in Hong Kong safely around 3 a.m., Malaysia Airlines said, and the 271 passengers on board have been transferred onto flights with other airlines.

The reason for the diversion of Malaysia Airlines Flight 066 was “an inoperative aircraft generator, which supplies normal electrical power,” the company said. Electrical power continued to be supplied by the plane’s auxiliary power unit, it said.

Malaysia Airlines is in the international spotlight following the disappearance more than two weeks ago of one of its passenger jets with 239 people on board. That plane, Flight 370, was on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when it vanished over Southeast Asia.

The flight that was diverted Monday set off from Kuala Lumpur at 11:37 p.m. Sunday and was scheduled to arrive at 6:50 a.m. the next day at Incheon International Airport, the main airport serving the South Korean capital, Seoul.

Hong Kong airport said it received a call at 2:30 a.m. alerting it of the flight’s urgent change of course and placed local teams on standby. The plane made its emergency landing without any problems about half an hour later.

The scheduled return flight from Incheon to Kuala Lumpur has been canceled, Malaysia Airlines said, and passengers have been placed on other flights."

Airbus orders more frequent A380 wing fatigue checks - Yahoo Movies UK,"Thu, 06 Mar 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vdWsubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvYWlyYnVzLW9yZGVycy1tb3JlLWZyZXF1ZW50LWEzODAtMjI0NDExNDc1Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Workers set up exhibition booths near a model of an Airbus A380 aircraft ahead of the Singapore Airshow February 7, 2014.

By Tim Hepher

BERLIN (Reuters) - Europe's Airbus (AIR.PA) has ordered more frequent inspections of the wings of the world's largest passenger jet after discovering unexpected levels of metal fatigue during testing on an A380 factory mock-up, industry sources said on Thursday.

The planemaker has asked airlines to inspect the wing's ""spars"" or main internal beams during regular major overhauls carried out after six years in service, and then again at 12 years, instead of waiting for the 12-year overhaul, they said.

The move comes as Airbus emerges from a painful two-year programme of modifications and hundreds of millions of euros of financial charges triggered by the discovery of cracks on brackets inside the wings of A380 jets already flying.

This time, however, Airbus has not so far been able to duplicate the fatigue test results on any aircraft in service.

The double-decker A380 entered service in 2007 with Singapore Airlines (SIAL.SI) followed by the largest customer, Emirates, which would be first in line to carry out the increased checks.

An Airbus spokeswoman confirmed the discovery of unspecified ""fatigue findings"" on a factory test plane.

""This will be addressed during routine maintenance inspections and the aircraft remains safe to fly,"" she said.

Most aircraft undergo a regular pattern of checks from small daily ones to heavy maintenance checks every five or six years.

Aircraft industry experts have known for decades that metal fatigue cannot be eliminated, but have worked out a system for monitoring it backed up by mandatory maintenance schedules.

The test plane used for the A380 fatigue tests is used to replicate the wear and tear that the superjumbo would endure during three times its normal life, the spokeswoman said.

""Fatigue tests are a normal part of the design and certification process,"" she said.

Airlines nonetheless face unanswered questions over whether the inspections could lead to further expensive repairs.

Story continues

""There may eventually have to be some kind of an upgrade at the overhaul stage but no action is required now,"" an industry source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Airlines are also sensitive to the amount of time an aircraft has to remain offline for each maintenance visit.

While the brackets that caused the company's 2012 wing cracks crisis are not individually viewed as critical parts, wing spars are beams that run outwards from the fuselage and are a fundamental part of the airplane's structure.

Each A380 has three spars holding up the wing.

To deal with the earlier problem of cracked brackets, Airbus devised a temporary fix followed by a permanent one that has been gradually working its way through the production line.

Qatar Airways, which refused to take aircraft with the temporary patch in order to avoid having to put them back for further work, is due to take its first three fully modified aircraft in June.

The airline's chief executive said earlier he may exercise options for three more A380s on top of 10 already ordered, and may order even more if the jet performs well in service.

But he expressed doubts over the A380's ability to fly profitably on some of the world's longest routes.

Qatar Airways plans to introduce A380 services this summer starting with Doha to London, which is well inside the range of the 525-seat passenger jet.

Airbus recreates the surface of Mars in Stevenage to test the ESA's ExoMars rover - New Atlas,"Fri, 28 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1tYXJzLWVzYS1leG9tYXJzLXJvdmVyLzMxNDA2L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aeronautics giant Airbus has completed its project to recreate the surface of Mars in Stevenage, UK. The site, roughly the size of a basketball arena, is designed to test the navigation and locomotion systems of the ESA's ExoMars rover ahead of its launch in 2018.

The 30 x 13 m (98 x 42 ft) ""Mars yard"" required 300 tonnes (331 tons) of sand to simulate the surface of the Red Planet, and features rocky debris such as that encountered by previous rovers. The simulation has to be as realistic as possible in order to asses elements such as wear and tear on the wheels of the rover, a factor which has been a cause for concern recently with NASA's Curiosity rover, which is already operational on Mars.

""A facility like this enables us to develop sophisticated navigation systems to ‘teach’ Mars rovers how to drive autonomously across the Red Planet,"" said Alvaro Giménez, Director of Science and Robotic Exploration for the ESA. ""This will be a fantastic resource for the ExoMars rover team and for future missions to come.""

The ExoMars project is a collaboration between the ESA and the Russian Roscosmos space agency, with the overreaching goal of the program being to assess whether life ever existed on Mars. To achieve this goal, the ExoMars program is divided between 2016 and 2018 launches. The 2016 mission will take the form of a Trace Gas Orbiter, which will orbit the Red Planet studying atmospheric gasses. The 2018 mission is to be comprised of the ExoMars rover, equipped with a suite of sensors and a drill for obtaining samples.

Before launch, however, the rover's navigation and locomotion systems must be stringently tested. Due to the extreme distance between the ESA team controlling the rover and the machine itself, direct control of the ExoMars rover would be impossible. Therefore the rover will be required to navigate autonomously, using only its on-board sensors to reach pre-set destinations on the surface of Mars.

The team is hoping that the rover will be able to cover 70 m (230 ft) per day, substantially less than the 100 m (328 ft) covered by NASA's Curiosity rover. To this end, the walls and ceiling of the facility have been painted a reddish-brown color in order to create as realistic a setting as possible in which the rover can learn to navigate.

Colin Paynter, Head of Airbus Defence and Space UK, said regarding the mission that ""ExoMars is a hugely fascinating program and the new yard brings us one step closer to launch.""

The facility will continue to be of use once ExoMars is operational on the Red Planet, as any difficulties experienced by the mission could then be recreated in the Mars yard. This will allow the operators of the rover to consider the best course of action, without placing the actual multimillion dollar robot in harm's way.

ANALYSIS: What does Boeing's 777X mean for airlines and Airbus? - Flightglobal,"Thu, 27 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYW5hbHlzaXMtd2hhdC1kb2VzLWJvZWluZ3MtNzc3eC1tZWFuLWZvci1haXJsaW5lcy1hbmQtYWlyYnVzLzExMjU3OS5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When Boeing launched the 777X at last year’s Dubai air show, backed by commitments for over 300 aircraft from four customers, Toulouse’s worst nightmare became a reality. Having suffered at the hands of Boeing in the “big-twin” sector for much of the last decade,, Airbus has been making good headway with its A350 XWB, racking up sales of more than 800 aircraft – only for Boeing to come out with an enhanced derivative of its bestseller.

Unsurprisingly, Airbus is dismissive of the threat posed by the new big-twin. But given its backing from blue-chip customers like Cathay Pacific, Lufthansa and the Gulf’s triumvirate of global network carriers, should the European manufacturer be taking the threat from the 777X more seriously? And do the airlines once again find themselves with just one go-to vendor when seeking the largest twin-engined “seat-production machine”?

Airbus’s new-generation widebody products comprise four models: the A380 superjumbo and three variants of the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-powered A350. Its only in-production widebody twinjet is the A330. Series production of the A350 is beginning as Airbus works towards the first delivery of the initial variant, the -900, to launch customer Qatar Airways in the fourth quarter of 2014.

The two-member 777X family in the 350- to 400-seat category slots in at the top of Boeing’s widebody twinjet line-up, above its three variants of 787 and below the 747-8I. The 777X, which is due to enter service in 2020, is the successor to today’s strong-selling 777-300ER and the ultra-long range -200LR.

The 777-9X is the larger variant, featuring a slight stretch over the -300ER and raising seating by around 14 passengers in similar typical layouts. The 350-seat -8X is developed from the 777-200 airframe, with a 10-frame stretch.

Other major changes on the 777X include a larger, composite wing which incorporates folding tips to allow it to use 777-sized parking bays and taxiways, all-new General Electric GE9X engines and a revised cabin.

“The 777-8X sits right on top of the A350-1000 in terms of size, but has a range advantage and is slightly more fuel efficient. And then we have the [larger] -9X, which gives us the ability to go into that territory that is unchallenged, which is really, really great,” says Boeing’s marketing vice-president Randy Tinseth.

The A350 and 787 met for the first time on the tarmac at February’s Singapore air show, prompting a rise in the rhetoric about the rival manufacturers’ contrasting widebody strategies. Airbus argues that its product line offers simplicity, while Boeing points to an even spread of aircraft across the 200-400 seat sector.

“Boeing has been waxing eloquent about how impressive their widebody product line is. Well actually it looks like a bit of a dog’s breakfast to me,” says Airbus chief operating officer for customers John Leahy. “If they’ve got the sweet spot in the market, there are an awful lot of sweet spots.”

Boeing's incremental-step-in-size strategy for widebodies (top) “looks more like a dog’s breakfast” to Airbus (bottom)

Leahy argues that airlines want simplicity, and that Boeing’s multifaceted line-up is “not reasonable” in the current age: “My competitor has eight different models competing with four of ours. Those eight different models represent four aircraft families within them – different cockpits, different engines, different support.”

However, Boeing highlights its sales success in the widebody sector as evidence that it has called the strategy right. The market is currently voting slightly in favour of Seattle, with Boeing holding a 55% share of the widebody twinjet backlog.

“We’re very pleased with how we’re positioned with our widebody product offering – from 200-400 seats we have a complete line of 787s and 777s in the marketplace. From orders to deliveries to backlog, we lead the competition,” says Tinseth. “Airbus has a lot of questions it has to answer – what does it do about the A330, about the A350-800 – I think the writing is on the wall already – and about the A350-1000.

""They signed up a great customer in Cathay Pacific for the -1000, and now all of a sudden it is also a 777X customer, so it really limits what the -1000 can do.”

Sales of the 777-300ER have outpaced even Boeing’s most optimistic forecasts, with total sales standing at 721 aircraft – including 263 on backlog. Tinseth attributes the -300ER’s surprise success to two main factors: “It crushed the competition – the A340-600 just wasn’t a viable competitor, which helped us, and we recognised that a lot of airlines bought the 747 for its range. But frankly we got that percentage wrong, and more bought it for this capability than for its size.”

Some observers see the A350 family potentially being under threat at both ends. Customers have been abandoning the A350-800 like rats on a sinking ship, switching their orders to the larger variants. This has raised questions over the future of the smallest variant, and comes as Boeing expands its 787 line-up with the launch of the -10 at last year’s Paris air show. Meanwhile, the arrival of the 777-9X could force Airbus to respond with a bigger derivative of the A350-1000.

“At face value, Airbus faces some interesting challenges with their widebody product strategy,” says Rob Morris, head of consutancy with Flightglobal’s Ascend advisory service.

“Boeing has its 787 family covering 240-320 seats, and then 777X at 350-400 seats,"" he says. ""By comparison, Airbus will potentially have the A350 spanning 270-350 seats, with the family probably starting at 315 seats if the -800 fails to make the light of day, as many predict.

""We also suspect that the A330-200/300 will exit passenger-variant production towards the end of this decade, largely because the similarly sized A350-900 renders new-build A330-300s economically uncompetitive.

“The Airbus conundrum is do they consider a family below the A350 – potentially covering 220 to 300 seats – or do they consider a 380-450 seat family to close the gap between A350-1000 and 558-seat A380? In demand terms, the 220- to 300-seat sector will probably have greater demand, but the challenge of creating an economically competitive twin-aisle of this size is considerable.

""And if Airbus chooses this route, then it would probably leave the 777-9X to itself in the market, creating the potential monopoly space that would allow Boeing to manage pricing in that space to its benefit – as it has been able to over the past few years with the 777-300ER.”

Cathay Pacific, which is a launch customer for both the A350-1000 and the 777-9X, is the world’s second-largest 777-300ER operator, with a total of 53 in service and on order. The Hong Kong airline’s engineering director Christopher Gibbs sees the two rival twinjets as complementary, and is not concerned that one manufacturer could gain a monopolistic position.

“Competition is useful, but I’m not sure it’s sufficient to completely duplicate on each other,” he says. “We see the positioning between the 777-9X and the A350-1000 as a bit different – the -9X is bigger. So for routes that need a smaller demand, the -1000 is appropriate, and for routes with bigger demand, the -9X is right.”

Airbus chief executive Fabrice Bregier attributes Boeing’s decision to add a stretch to the 777-9X (over the -300ER) to the need for competitive economics, but he leaves the door open to a competitive response with the A350.

“The 777X has to be slightly bigger because it could not compete against the A350-1000,” says Bregier. “So they were in the sweet spot [with the 777-300ER] – which was 360 passengers in three classes – and we just took over this sweet spot. So we believe the A350-1000 and A380 should be more than sufficient,” he says. “However, in the long run we are improving our product, so we have no short-term/mid-term plan to do that [a stretch], and we don’t think we have to do that, but we could well envisage additional members of the A350 family.”

Cathay’s Gibbs says the airline selected the 777-9X “most importantly” because it offers around 14 more seats than its 777-300ERs. “So it’s a plane for growth on our long-haul routes which need more capacity. And it will fly long-haul routes extremely efficiently,” he says.

Gibbs says that fuel accounts for 65-70% of Cathay’s incremental costs on long-haul operations, “so fuel-burn efficiency is really paramount and is a really important factor in our decision making”.

Despite Boeing’s early sales success with the 777-9X, Ascend’s head of market analysis Chris Seymour is not convinced Airbus needs to respond, as the A350-1000 is “ideally placed” to replace 777-300ERs – combining similar capacity and better economics. “Emirates Airline president [and A350-1000 customer] Tim Clark says it’s the ideal aircraft for 10-hour missions with no crew-rest requirements. The 777-9X also looks to be very good in terms of range, economics, cargo capacity and 30-40 seats more – ideal for growth over -300ERs at carriers like Emirates,” he says.

“Airlines are ordering and will order both – so does Airbus need to try to stretch into an ‘A350-1100’? Maybe not. Will every long-haul market served by A330-300s or 777-200ERs grow into a 400-seat market? Probably not – more like 350 seats first, and the 777-8X may then be too heavy and have too much range compared to the 1000,” he adds.

Airbus aims to decide this year how it will tackle the market below the A350 – which could include addressing the -800’s sector – as it evaluates whether to develop an upgraded “A330neo” powered by new generation engines.

“To put new engines on the wings, it’s a big job. It’s not a decision you’re going to make quickly or easily. It’s a significant engineering task,” says Tom Williams, Airbus’ executive vice-president of programmes.

He adds that making small tweaks to optimise the aircraft could also bring about “pretty good improvements"".

""We’re not going to go back to the same situation with the original A350, where we got into a loop chasing weight, then went into the carbon wing,” he says.

Although the A330 has been in production for more than two decades, Williams believes that there is still “a very good market” for the twinjet, especially for operators who do not need the range of the A350 or Boeing 787, because of its lower price tag.

“We think there is an opportunity to keep flying the A330 alongside the A350 for quite a period of time. We don’t see it as a case where the A350 comes in and suddenly the A330 disappears. We think we can keep building the A330s, certainly through this decade,” says Williams.

The 777X’s arrival potentially creates a few headaches for Boeing’s long-term product strategy, namely around how it manages the transition – both production and sales – from the current 777, and the implications for the slow-selling 747-8I.

From a transition perspective, Boeing’s current backlog for the -300ER (and 777 Freighter) of approximately 300 aircraft represents around three years of production at current rates, which means it still has some way to go in sales to bridge to the introduction of the 777X in 2020. Observers expect there will be a one- or two-year overlap between the 777-300ER and the 777X, which would mean production ending in around 2022.

Boeing has “a plan” for when production will switch over, “but we’ve not shared that”, says Tinseth.

“We can take a similar approach from when we went from the 737NG to the Max – that was a successful strategy, and we can do many of the same things,” says Tinseth. “When we went to our customers with the Max, we coupled those with NGs to help with their transition as well as with ours. We’re going to take that same mentality into our 777 campaigns.”

The 777F could also come into play, says Tinseth. “Our competition doesn’t have a freighter, so if the cargo market turns around as we expect it will, we have the 777F to help with the transition.”

Ascend’s Morris believes the plan to use the 737 Max transition may not be quite as straightforward as Boeing anticipates, however. “When said quickly, it sounds easy to run the same transition plan. However, the 777 customer base is a little different, with fewer operators and more concentration. So I wonder how big fleet operators will react to the prospect of having to take some last-off-the-line 777-300ERs whilst they wait for their 777Xs,” he says.

Morris also thinks that there could be issues around residual values: “777-300ERs will typically be on 12-year finance terms or operating leases, so how will Boeing incentivise operators to keep those last-off-the-line -300ERs for 12 years in the face of their fuel-burn penalty over 777Xs?

“I guess that will depend on where fuel prices are in the 2020s, but it seems likely that some deep discounts will be required to place -300ERs rolling off the line through the transition phase.""

Despite being slightly smaller than the 747-8I, if the 777-9X delivers on its operating cost promises then it will clearly pile pressure on the Boeing’s four-engined legend. But Boeing is confident the 747 programme can cope with some sibling rivalry.

“We’ve positioned the 747-8I to be 15% larger in seat count than the larger 777X, the -9X,” says Scott Fancher, who is Boeing’s general manager of airplane development. “The 747-8 is also a great freighter – it’s a great ‘switcher’, to use an American baseball term – and that gives it great legs in the marketplace to run the distance.”

Tinseth says Boeing was pleased to secure 17 gross orders for the 747-8 during 2013, which is “right in line with our production rates”, but he warns that it has “got to do that every year” to ensure continued production of the big jet is viable.

Boeing would not have to do much to the 777X to create a single-deck airliner sized to replace the 747-8 in capacity terms, and Fancher does not rule out the suggestion that there could one day be a “777-10X” derivative: “Never say never – never rule out a possible [‘777-10X’], but today our focus is on the -8 and -9.""

So the 777X arrival creates new challenges for both major airframe manufacturers, but it is Airbus that has the most questions to tackle, and we should begin to see some answers before 2014 is out.

The Swiss-based global forwarder will further streamline Airbus’ operational processes “to increase efficiency along the supply chain”, says a statement.

Kuehne + Nagel has been performing contract logistics services for Airbus since 2008, although the scope of activities and the geographical range have been extended continuously.

The portfolio of value added services now includes tasks not directly related to Airbus’ core business, such as aircraft section handling, kitting, after sales support and wing wrapping for the A380.

Other milestones in the cooperation with Airbus will be the operation of a new logistics hub which is to be opened in Toulouse later this year.

The airline has configured the A330s with a single-class premium configuration, featuring 271 seats, that is similar to the premium economy offerings of competing carriers. It will begin scheduled flights in April 2014 from its base in Tokyo Haneda to Fukuoka, while also extending its services to Sapporo and Naha at a later date.

Skymark Airlines new A330

Skymark offers a unique all-premium service, meaning that it does not feature an economy class offering to customers. Instead, the carrier maintains only business and premium economy cabins. The carrier made history in 2010, when it became the first Japanese carrier to order four Airbus A380 superjumbos, each featuring a two-class premium configuration – 114 in business and 280 in premium economy. Once delivered, Skymark intends to deploy the aircraft on long-haul services to destinations such as London, Paris and New York.

Shinichi Nishikubo, president of Skymark Airlines, said: “We are confident that with these cost-efficient, reliable A330-300s in our fleet, we will grow our business and win market share by attracting passengers who demand only the highest levels of comfort. Together with our A380s to come, we confirm Skymark’s intention to remain at the forefront of our market, having one of Japan’s youngest, most modern fuel-efficient fleets.”

Created in the Mercedes-Benz Advanced Design Studio in Como, Italy, the luxury EC145 made its first US appearance, at Heli-Expo in California, earlier this month. Inspired by the luxe saloons of Mercedes Benz, the EC145 Mercedes-Benz style helicopter brings the exquisite style and superior function of some of the finest European cars to the skies.





Claimed to be the only helicopter in its class that can seat up to eight passengers, the Mercedes-Benz Style EC145’s interior is decked out with some of the finest materials including fine leather and wood details. In addition to it, the special edition chopper offers an advanced in-flight entertainment system, subtle ambient lighting, and a choice of modular storage cabinets. The designers have also modified the external look of the EC145 to give it a distinguished appearance including a redesign of the front end, special shrouding for the skid gear, and a custom paint scheme. But where the helicopter really shines is the comfortable flight experience which is unparalleled. The prices for the Mercedes Benz EC145 helicopter start at $8.5 million.

Super Puma crash inquiry highlights maintenance failures - Vertical Magazine,"Fri, 14 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3Mvc3VwZXJwdW1hY3Jhc2hpbnF1aXJ5aGlnaGxpZ2h0c21haW50ZW5hbmNlZmFpbHVyZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Judiciary of Scotland has issued a determination for its fatal accident inquiry into the 2009 crash of a Super Puma helicopter operated by Bond Offshore Helicopters Ltd., concluding that better maintenance and inspection procedures might have prevented the accident.

All 16 people on board the Eurocopter (now Airbus Helicopters) Super Puma were killed when the helicopter plunged into the North Sea on April 1, 2009, en route from the Miller Oil Platform to Aberdeen, Scotland. In October 2011, the United Kingdom Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) found that the crash resulted from a catastrophic failure of the helicopter’s main gearbox.

Nearly five years after the crash occurred, the Judiciary of Scotland convened an inquiry into the fatal accident at the urging of victims’ families. Presided over by Sheriff Principal Derek Pyle, the hearing ran over a period of six weeks in Aberdeen, and included testimony from a senior AAIB engineering inspector, a senior Airbus Helicopters transmission expert, and other witnesses.

In its 2011 report on the accident, the AAIB concluded that the accident helicopter’s catastrophic main gearbox failure initiated in one of the eight second-stage planet gears in the gearbox’s epicyclic module, and stemmed from a fatigue crack. The only indication of the impending failure of the second-stage planet gear was a metallic particle discovered on the epicyclic chip detector one week and approximately 36 flying hours prior to the accident.

Although the AAIB report recognizes spalling, or rolling contact fatigue, as a possible cause of the failure, it does not rule out the possibility that the failure was due to a material defect in the planet gear or damage due to the presence of foreign object debris. During his testimony at the inquiry, AAIB inspector Mark Jarvis declined to say which of these three possibilities was the most likely cause of the failure, citing insufficient evidence.

Airbus Helicopters expert witness Dr. Emmanuel Mermoz, however, testified that the failure was more likely due to spalling than to a material defect, arguing that a material defect would have become apparent at a much earlier stage in the lifetime of the epicyclic module. After weighing the evidence and determining that the presence of foreign object debris was also unlikely, Pyle agreed with Mermoz’s conclusion, thus shifting the focus to Bond’s procedures for detecting spalling through regular maintenance.

In his determination, Pyle notes that Bond “readily acknowledged” that it failed to carry out appropriate maintenance manual procedures following discovery of the metallic particle on the epicyclic chip detector. This failure was further exacerbated by misunderstandings between Bond and the aircraft manufacturer regarding health and usage monitoring system (HUMS) indications, although Pyle concluded that those misunderstandings did not “mitigate the responsibility of Bond to follow the manual.” In his determination, he writes, “On many occasions during the inquiry it was acknowledged that the primary rule throughout the industry is that everything must be done by the book — that is to say, in accordance with the maintenance manual. There can therefore be no excuse for not doing so.”

Despite his harsh criticism of Bond’s maintenance procedures, Pyle did not find conclusively that correct maintenance procedures would have prevented the accident. According to his determination, “the failure to detect a significant fault in the helicopter’s gearbox . . . possibly — but only possibly — resulted in the crash.” To read the full determination, click here

In its response to the determination , Bond stated, “Although Sheriff Principal Pyle has indicated that spalling was, on balance, the most likely reason for the catastrophic gearbox failure which caused the accident — a view not shared by the independent Air Accident Investigation Branch — he did find that this was not proved beyond reasonable doubt. Additionally, he determined that even if we had followed the correct procedure it is by no means certain that the gearbox would have been removed, as there may not have been sufficient evidence of particles to warrant its removal.

“We are pleased the Sheriff Principal recognized that Bond engineers understood the vital importance of their role in ensuring the safety of their pilots and passengers. But we have always accepted that we made mistakes through honest confusion over telephone calls and emails. Lessons needed to be learned, lessons have been learned and lessons continue to be learned. We are absolutely committed to continuing to drive safety improvements across the business, and will study the Sheriff Principal’s recommendations carefully, along with our industry colleagues.”"

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--A maturing small twin-aisle aircraft market presents challenges and opportunities for Airbus as it considers the future of its A330 aircraft, according to Steve Mason, Vice President of Aircraft Analysis, CIT Aerospace at CIT Group Inc. (NYSE: CIT) (cit.com), a leading provider of financing and advisory services to small businesses and middle market companies. These views and others are presented in “The Small Twin-Aisle Market: What’s Next?” (cit.com/mason), the latest piece of market intelligence to be featured in the CIT Executive Insights series (cit.com/executiveinsights).

Small Twin-Aisle Aircraft Market Outlook

Since the introduction of the Boeing 767 in 1982 and Airbus’ A330 in 1994, the small twin-aisle aircraft segment has been an area of strength for these aircraft manufacturers. “For Airbus and Boeing, the 250- to 400-seat twin-aisle market has proven successful, especially compared with the commoditized single-aisle market and the unpredictable very large aircraft (VLA) market,” says Mason.

Mason adds that CIT recently analyzed the capacity requirements of the 250- to 300-seat market, commenting, “We concluded that between 2018 and 2021, major U.S. trunk carriers, Asian carriers throughout the continent, especially in China, along with major European carriers will need additional capacity in this seat market.”

The A330 at a Crossroads

Airbus continues to invest in the A330 and plans to introduce its longer-range 242T MTOW version in 2015, for which CIT is proud to be the launch customer. However, Airbus faces important decisions as the A330 airframe ages and the market evolves.

“Twenty years after its introduction, the A330 is at a crossroads,” says Mason. “The aircraft is not selling as well as Airbus would like, and the question now facing both the company and its customers is what options remain for the A330 and, for that matter, the entire 250- to 300-seat market.”

Choices for Airbus

According to Mason, Airbus has four principal options for the A330: do nothing and cede market share in this segment; introduce small tweaks, such as incremental improvements in engine efficiency; rely on a “shrink” version of the larger A350-800 to cover this market segment; or implement substantial changes to the aircraft.

“Rather than tweaking the design, Airbus could invest in a major overhaul that would undoubtedly include new engines,” says Mason. “Engine manufacturers are pushing Airbus to consider existing engine designs for a new A330 – dubbed the A330neo, or ‘new engine option’ – that could benefit both Airbus and the engine manufacturers.”

The Best Option: Finding Additional Value for the A330

Mason believes that the best option for Airbus is to invest in improvements to the A330 that add value and extend the life of the airframe. “While the A330’s sales may be trailing off, the plane remains one of the workhorses of the Airbus fleet,” says Mason. “The company’s best option for combating declining sales and maintaining market share against rising competition from Boeing is to pursue its options for extending the life of the aircraft. We believe Airbus can design a modified A330 that is competitive, and that best serves the interests of its customers and shareholders.”

It is a French airline, founded in July of 2000, that mostly flies from Paris to destinations in the Caribbean. In 2012, the airline flew 1.2 millions passengers, 750,000 of which were on long-haul routes.

It operates a fleet of five Airbus A330s (one -200 and four -300s) and three ATR 72s. They currently have six A350s on order (three for the -900 and three for the -1000).

The livery is one that you might expect from an airline flying to and from sunny destinations. The blue belly is reminiscent of the water and the green (what looks like) palms give a feeling of the tropics. This livery should look pretty slick on the Airbus A350, especially with those blended winglets.

13 Airbus A320neo aircraft on option to buy (and convertible into the larger A321neo)

9 Airbus A320ceo (current engine option) currently order to be cancelled

Deliveries are to commence from 2018 through to 2025, with the aircraft powered by two Pratt & Whitney PurePower PW1100G-JM geared turbofan engines. The nine aircraft that are being cancellated were due to be delivered between 2014 and 2016.

Tigerair Singapore currently operates 22 Airbus A320 aircraft, with other airlines in the group operating the A320 family as its chosen aircraft to deliver services with a majority A320 fleet with a sprinkling of A319s operating within Tigerair Singapore, Tigerair Australia, Tigerair Mandala and Tigerair Philippines.

Tigerair has come a long away since the low point of the grounding of Tiger Australia, and whilst the fleet expansion isn’t big by some low-cost carrier standards, it’s a measured controlled growth.

Engineers examine BA plane forced back to Heathrow after 'engine surge' - The Guardian,"Fri, 07 Mar 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDE0L21hci8wNy9iYS1lbmdpbmVlcnMtYWlyYnVzLWZvcmNlZC1sYW5kaW5nLWhlYXRocm930gFZaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3dvcmxkLzIwMTQvbWFyLzA3L2JhLWVuZ2luZWVycy1haXJidXMtZm9yY2VkLWxhbmRpbmctaGVhdGhyb3c?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Engineers are investigating a British Airways plane that was forced to turn back to Heathrow with flames spitting from its engine moments after take-off.

The aircraft, an Airbus 319 bound for Lyon, had an engine surge and had to make a priority landing shortly after 9pm on Thursday.

BA ruled out a wider inquiry into its fleet of A319s, dubbed ""Babybuses"".

Tom Puttick, who works near Heathrow, was working in the petrol station opposite the airport when he heard a bang: ""I turned around and the airplane had flames spitting out of the engine with a spluttering noise as it was taking off.

""I then watched it continue to climb and the engine was still emitting flames intermittently. Lots of blue lights then emerged on the airport while the plane, I guess, turned around to make an emergency landing.""

The aircraft was forced to land using one engine, turning around mid-air to make a ""priority landing"" before passengers left on foot from the runway.

BA officials said the malfunction was caused by a ""relatively minor technical issue"" and declined to say whether and when the plane would be back in the air.

It is the second A319 to be forced to land in less than a year. Last May, one A319 had to make an emergency landing at Heathrow after a maintenance error led to engine parts being blown off the plane, triggering an urgent review by the Air Accident Investigation Board (AAIB).

BA said the incident would not cause delays to other scheduled flights on Friday and over the weekend.

A spokesman for the airline said: ""A flight yesterday experienced what's known as an engine surge as it took off, but it returned and landed normally at Heathrow.

""We train our pilots to the very highest standards including how to respond to these type of events. Our crew cared for our customers on board and kept them informed.

""We gave our customers, who were on the flight, hotel accommodation and they have been rebooked to fly today. We have also scheduled a larger aircraft to operate to Lyon to ensure we can get all our customers there as soon as possible. We can understand how frustrating the delay to their plans must be.""

There are almost 1,400 A319 passenger planes in operation around the world, with BA owning a fleet of 33."
Case study: diversity and dignity at Airbus - HRZone,"Fri, 28 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vaHJ6b25lLmNvbS9jYXNlLXN0dWR5LWRpdmVyc2l0eS1hbmQtZGlnbml0eS1hdC1haXJidXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus manufactures commercial aeroplanes and operates from sites across Europe; aircraft wings are manufactured in the UK. The organisation is complex, incorporating transnational reporting lines. The company is two years into an ongoing initiative with UK HR and employment law firm Vista to deliver a Dignity at Work and Diversity programme that is proving successful amongst its UK staff.

The challenge

Airbus is a demanding organisation where ‘production is king’, so any Dignity at Work programme was going to require justification: it’s always difficult to get people to take time out of the business when the correlation with the bottom line isn’t obvious. There was the inevitable question: “Why bother with a Dignity at Work programme?” Things were not ostensibly ‘broken’, so the question arose: ‘why fix it?’

But in reality, how could we be sure that things don’t need fixing? Dignity at work is always going to be a challenge in a workforce the size of a small town because of the mixture of people and their own different value sets.

Rather than a programme of remedial action, our approach allowed us to take a more positive and proactive approach. It recognised that dignity and diversity issues are in the work place, the media and beyond – and was an opportunity to take control of those messages.

The commitment

The challenge was to deliver a consistent message, enabling Airbus’s values to resonate across the organisation with its diverse working environments. A demonstrable commitment from the organisation was essential. In developing our approach, our guiding principles were those of credibility, commitment, alignment and perspective.

This commitment was tested by reflecting on the potential implications of starting the diversity and dignity conversation with the workforce. A short- term effect might be to increase the visibility of ‘issues’ as expectations were communicated. If we started something, we needed the commitment to follow it through. So we had an open and honest conversation with the leadership team about dealing meaningfully with employee relations issues as they arise.

The strategy

To ensure stakeholder support, pilot sessions were delivered to a cross section of the organisation – including the trade unions. The views of those who were more sceptical about the programme were important. These sessions provided the opportunity to identify how to get it right, rather than receive endorsement – although crucially we had support from a very senior level to help convince management teams to buy into the idea.

The next important part of the strategy was the ‘top-down approach’. The aim was to be in a position to manage the managers’ performance on dealing with issues. This in turn quickly demonstrated to the attendees that the programme would help them to do their job as part of their development, and enhanced everybody’s commitment to the message.

The tactics

We had previously used a drama sequence approach with success in other initiatives, so we knew that people would participate because their colleagues had recommended it. The drama sequences created a realistic environment for practical learning and development: scenarios needed to be recognisable, so the video clips and examples were chosen carefully to meet the needs of the different audiences – both office and production environments. The key was to trigger legitimate disagreements – rather than obvious dos and don’ts. The debate then became about how an Airbus manager should act in a variety of challenging situations.

The delivery

The programme was delivered in three ways as part of the top-down approach: through leadership, line management, and employee briefings. The two-hour leadership sessions gave senior leaders a preview of the materials that their team would experience. The pitch and duration were important in obtaining their support, which in turn led to them releasing their teams to attend the programme.

The four-hour line management sessions comprised mixed sub-culture groups. Key themes here were positive creation and enforcement of the right environment by having the confidence to act early and informally.

Finally, the employee briefings were shorter and more directive. They explained the standard of behaviour expected of everybody within the organisation and provided the momentum for line managers to tackle issues. They also provided guidance on what to do if an employee had concerns.

The results

I strongly believe that the programme has established a standard amongst managers about what is and isn’t acceptable. Managers say they now feel more confident about tackling some of the difficult situations and conversations, and they also recognise the importance of doing this early on, before situations escalate.

We’ve openly recognised that there are behaviours that exist in the company (as in any community) that are unacceptable. We know we can’t erase them but we have demonstrated a commitment to tackling difficult situations and improving the working environment for all employees.

Some reflections

The feedback obtained included 97% of delegates saying they would be able to put what was learnt into practice. Over 93% viewed the drama sequences as very helpful towards achieving their learning objectives.

Reflecting on the programme, the best advice I can give is to get the right pitch; which means having a message that people can buy into. If the programme does not develop a momentum of its own – stop and take stock. It’s about a positive message, capturing that message and creating a context in which it can resonate in day-to-day situations. The HR conversation is part of the business conversation. In short, we want people to keep talking about ‘banana’ issues: those issues that threaten to cause a serious slip-up.

What’s next?

We are working with Vista on the next stage that will reach every employee across the business, and we will keep this programme rolling on an ongoing basis to ensure that all new managers receive the same training as the first cohort. We are confident that we will deliver a clear message about acceptable and unacceptable behaviours, and ensure that our values remain front-of-mind for everyone."
Airbus chief: 'I no longer think like a Frenchman' - The Local France,"Thu, 20 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWxvY2FsLmZyLzIwMTQwMzIwL2ZyYW5jZS1uZWVkcy10by1sb3ZlLWl0cy1jb21wYW5pZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Advertisement

Airbus Group CEO and President Fabrice Brégier knows a few things about the gaps, gulfs and bridges between British, French and American working cultures and it has had a profound influence on him.

He says he is French by birth ""but no longer in his way of thinking.""

Brégier pilots a multinational group with 75,000 employees, though headquartered in Toulouse in the south of France, has operations everywhere from Miami to Beijing. Not surprisingly the company’s official language is English and its culture is a hodgepodge of influences from everywhere it operates.

'I am shocked when I see the behaviour of France'

During a talk with the Anglo-American Press Association in Paris on Thursday, Brégier told The Local and other media what the French could learn from Anglos and that attitudes in France towards business must change.

""I am sometimes shocked when I come back here and I see France's behaviour. I’m not afraid to say it,” he said.

Brégier said his country has plenty of strong points, but a love for its businesses is not one of them.

""We are never business-friendly enough. Frankly I believe France has an enormous amount of strengths: geographically-speaking, the infrastructure and public services,” he said.

“But I think that France’s problem is that it needs to understand that it must love its companies. It’s not linked to taxes, it’s more on the societal level. Which is to say a Frenchman is not going to love business or the world of business, if we compare him with Anglos. It’s a handicap.”

(Bregier at a the Singapore Airshow in February (Roslan Rahman/AFP)

France’s mountains of bureaucracy and the hefty payroll charges have been on the radar of Socialist President François Hollande as he tries to boost support for business to help nudge the country out of its economic malaise.

Ministers and commentators have been sounding the alarm as young people are increasingly ditching France because they can’t find a job. In Brégier’s view, pushing entrepreneurship among recent graduates is one of the keys to restarting the country’s wobbling economy.

“We must encourage young people to start their own companies in France, because there are too many going abroad,"" he said.

“They can start their career in the United States, the United Kingdom or elsewhere, but they also must eventually decide they can succeed by starting their own business in France. That is the battle. The total environment must be more favorable and we have to stop blaming those who create businesses. That is very different from the Anglo-Saxon world.”

'A mix of cultures makes us stronger'

One of the potentially contentious issues for employees multinational companies based in France revolves around language. Most French companies normally insist on French being the lingua franca of work, but not Airbus it seems.

For Airbus workers the only official common tongue is Shakespeare’s language.

“Airbus’s language is English. I’m not going to tell you that when there are two French people in my office we speak in English, but we systematically speak English, emails are in English,"" Bregier said.

""My American and British colleagues have to constantly put up with bad English.”

Brégier sees the mix of cultures that has made English the company’s common language as a positive thing.

“This is an incredible strength. Merged together we are much stronger than being only French, all British or all American. I’m sure of it,” he said."

Working alongside Airbus Helicopters and the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD), the company hosted two separate weeks of trials which constitute part of the new integrated defensive aids suite fitted as part of the Puma Life Extension Programme currently being carried out across the RAF Puma fleet.

“This shows how our working relationship with major Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and the UK MoD continues to expand”, said Vector Aerospace UK’s operations director Ross Powlesland. “The variety of rotary wing platforms we can support continues to grow in both the military and civil sectors; having the heliport on site enables us to offer a fly-in, fly-out facility to our diverse customer base”.

“During the trials we offered our full flight test capability and specialised storage facilities to ensure that the potential of this new integrated defensive aids suite could be rigorously examined”, said Michael Tyrrell, managing director for Vector Aerospace UK. “Naturally we were delighted to be involved in such a cutting edge program and the experience has further developed our strong working relationships with both Airbus Helicopters and the MOD”."
The Big Blue Whale Comes to Prague – Korean A380 First Visit - Airline Reporter,"Sat, 15 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNC8wMy9iaWctYmx1ZS13aGFsZS1jb21lcy1wcmFndWUta29yZWFuLWEzODAtZmlyc3QtdmlzaXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Yesterday, Korean Air premiered their Airbus A380 to Prague on their regular scheduled flight from Seoul. I was fortunate enough to receive an invitation to welcome the aircraft to Prague.

This was the third A380 operation to Prague since its introduction to service. The first was a Lufthansa bird, which came to Prague for crew/diversion support training, and then Emirates last year on a medical diversion.

Korean Air presently operate eight A380’s in their fleet and they deploy them primarily on their key routes to Los Angeles and Hong Kong; this one-off flight to Prague therefore came as a bit of a surprise. The reason behind this aircraft substitution (in lieu of the regular A330/B777 mix on the route) was due to a major EU technology conference in Hanover and the requirement for a large business class cabin.

Korean Air operates the least-densely-configured A380. The lower deck consists of 12 first class seats and 301 economy class seats with a generous 34-inch pitch. The upper deck is all business class, with a 94-seat cabin -this is by far the largest business class cabin on an airliner (mixed-class) to date.

Upon arrival at the airport, all invitees for the event were required to check-in and we were issued special boarding passes. After the formalities and a security check, I made my way to the gate where a selection of food and beverages was available. There was also a stage set up for later announcements by various dignitaries and airline/airport management.

After a few glasses of champagne it was time to board the buses for an air-side photo shoot of the aircraft’s arrival. While the location/lighting were not the most ideal for photography, I was too excited to care as I got to witness a landing of the worlds largest commercial jet from a distance of no more than one football pitch.

Following the landing, we made our way hurriedly back to the gate area where a whole gate position had been blocked off for the event, allowing ample movement to get in the best position for the water cannon salute and subsequent gate arrival.

The water canon salute took almost five minutes to complete given the slow taxi of the aircraft (maybe the pilots were just trying to get a free wash). After, I made my way back into the terminal where more refreshments had been laid out and numerous speeches were given by various management, as well as the assistant transport minister for Czech Republic, and the Korean Ambassador.

Sadly, for now, Korean Air’s A330/B777s are set to return to Prague for the foreseeable future, but we can only hope the A380 will return on a more regular basis.

With Korean Air due to take delivery of more A380s this year, and the ever-increasing demand on the route during the summer season (Korean Air presently operate a B747-400 on the route on selected days) the A380 really could make a more regular appearance in Prague in the future.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank Korean Air, Czech Airlines, and Prague Airport for organizing this event and making it a huge success, not just with the AvGeek community, but also the general public, which clearly show enthusiasm for aviation here in Czech Republic.

This enthusiasm was clearly made evident by the large crowds surrounding the perimeter fence; I would estimate no less than 1,500 people came out to welcome the aircraft to Prague.

As such I take a bit of an interest in what this airline does.

Asiana Airlines put in an order for its Airbus A380s – a fleet of six aircraft – some time ago (and following fellow carrier Korean Air who also operates the A380).

Their first aircraft is now out of the paint shop at Hamburg, and is looking rather smart.

Asiana Airlines A380 at Hamburg – Photos via Airbus SAS.

The first aircraft is due to have its cabin fitted, along with all the systems related to the cabin, along with performance testing – before being returned to Toulouse in preparation for delivery.

The cabin will feature a three class cabin, made up of:

12 first class suites

66 business class seats

417 economy ‘Travel Class’ seats,

Total: 495 passengers

Delivery of the aircraft will be during the 2nd quarter of 2014 .

Asiana are planing to use the A380 initially on regional routes before being launched on a them to long haul routes to the USA – with Los Angeles earmarked as the first long haul destination.

Now, this is the point where I need to collect Star Alliance miles again isn’t it…

106 Economy Class seat with 31″-32″ of seat pitch

Business class seat have power at seat, whilst Economy class will have 2 socket between 3 seats.

The year round link was last operated in 2006, when the route was reduced to seasonal operation.

For those heading to/from St Johns, there is a significant time saving, with a direct flight taking 5 hours 35, whilst a flight via Toronto or Montreal will be at least 12 hours and more."

Asiana's first A380 unveiled in Hamburg - koreatimes,"Thu, 27 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYXRpbWVzLmNvLmtyL3BhZ2VzL2FydGljbGUuYXNwLzE1NDIyNNIBP2h0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYXRpbWVzLmNvLmtyL3BhZ2VzL2FydGljbGUuYW1wLmFzcD9uZXdzSWR4PTE1NDIyNA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An A380 double-deck passenger jet of Asiana Airline is unveiled to the media at Airbus's plant in Hamburg, Germany, Wednesday. / Courtesy of Airbus



By Kim Da-ye

HAMBURG, Germany ― Asiana Airlines on Wednesday unveiled the first of six new Airbus A380 planes the carrier will receive over the next three years at the aircraft manufacturer's plant.

After Airbus finished 12 days of exterior painting Monday and Asiana inspected the work Tuesday, the airplane rolled out of the painting hangar Wednesday. The airplane's interior will be completed at the same plant, and when finished, the plane will fly to Toulouse in France in mid May.

Asiana expects to receive the aircraft on May 26 in Toulouse and fly it to Korea by the end of the month.

The A380 plane will have its first commercial flight in mid-June on the Incheon-Narita and Incheon-Hong Kong routes. It will be put onto the Incheon-Los Angeles route from August.

Asiana, Korea's second largest carrier by revenue, ordered six A380 planes in January 2011. Asiana will receive two A380 planes this year, another two in 2015 and the other two in 2017. The catalog price of each jet is $414 million (445 billion won).

Asiana said that the firm chose to acquire the world's largest airplane to meet the increasing demand on long-haul routes.

Asiana's A380 airplane will have 495 seats ― 12 in first class, 66 in business and 417 in economy. The same aircraft model belonging to its competitor Korean Air has 407 seats ― 12 in first, 94 in business and 301 in economy. Emirates, which currently operates 45 A380s, has installed in each jet 14 suites in first class, 76 seats in business and 399 or 407 in economy.

Asiana said that it decided to have fewer business class seats and more economy class seats in order to carry more passengers. The carrier added that it has ""upgraded"" the first-class and business-class seats for the A380 jet.

The 83-inch-long first-class seat called the ""First Suite"" has more space and is accessed through a sliding door. It is fitted with a 32-inch high-definition liquid crystal display monitor, which the carrier boasts to be the industry's ""largest.""

For the business-class seats called ""Business Smartium,"" Asiana chose the ""Staggered layout"" to ensure privacy of each passenger. The seats can convert into fully flat beds.

For the economy class, the carrier created more leg room. The window seats on the upper deck come with personal storage space."

Inching closer to launching its operations, new no-frill carrier AirAsia India on Saturday took delivery of its first Airbus A320 as it landed in Chennai after flying in from Toulouse headquarters of the European aircraft manufacturer.

“Great news! India’s latest airline, AirAsia India, has taken delivery of its first A-320 equipped with Sharklets,” Airbus tweeted with a picture of the jet painted red and the name of the airline written in white.

Sharklets are the folded wing tips that helps an aircraft to glide smoothly, thereby reducing fuel burn and emission.

However, the no-frill carrier, a joint venture between Malaysia’s AirAsia Bhd, Tata Sons Ltd and Arun Bhatia of Telestra Tradeplace Pvt Ltd, is still awaiting a flying license from aviation regulator DGCA.

The A-320, bearing call-sign VT-ATF, landed in Chennai, where the headquarters of AirAsia India is located, at around 0930 hours this morning. The plane, configured in an all- economy layout with 180 seats, was greeted with a water cannon salute as it taxied on the runway, an airline statement said

“AirAsia India family takes immense pride in welcoming home it’s first aircraft which has just rolled of the manufacturing line from Toulouse”, AirAsia India’s CEO Mittu Chandilya said.

“The arrival of our first A320 signifies that we are a step closer to our dream to create a new benchmark in the low-cost air travel category”, he said.

Earlier in a tweet on the microblogging site, he had said, “Our first iron bird just left Toulouse to come home to India. Can’t wait to revolutionise Indian aviation.”

AirAsia India was granted in-principle approval for the import of ten A320-200 aircraft in December last year. It plans to operate a fleet of A320-200 aircraft, initially with 4-5 planes and quickly expand it to ten within a year.

In April last year, the Foreign Investment Promotion Board had approved the USD 30 million deal to launch AirAsia India, which received a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the Civil Aviation Ministry a few months later.

AirAsia India’s entry is expected to intensify competition in the Indian aviation industry, with the new entrant likely to offer low fares to undercut other airlines.

Malaysian carrier AirAsia’s group CEO Tony Fernandes said in a tweet: “Airasia India first aircraft arrives in India. In Chennai. Wow. Still a bit to do bit on the final straight.”

Last month, the DGCA had dismissed a collective objection by private airlines like IndiGo, Jet Airways, SpiceJet and GoAir, to the grant of a licence to AirAsia India.

They had argued that a September 2012 policy change allowing foreign airlines to invest in local airlines was applicable only to existing airlines and not new ones.

DGCA had set up a three-member committee to examine the objections and concluded that it found “no reasons to put on hold the processing of the application of M/s Air Asia (India) Pvt Ltd for issuance of Air Operator Permit”.

In an order, DGCA chief Prabhat Kumar had said “in view of the above, it is decided to consider the application of M/s. Air Asia (India) Pvt Ltd, for issuance of Air Operator’s Permit subject to compliance of various requirements” under the law and procedures.

It had also held that in view of the rapid growth of the civil aviation sector, there was “a strong need” to facilitate air traffic by encouraging the existing airlines as well as allowing new entrants so that Indian travellers could avail optimum availability of air traffic services at reasonably affordable tariffs.

DGCA had sent a team of its officers to Malaysia few weeks ago to inspect and certify facilities where the start-up carrier is training its cockpit and cabin crew.

AirAsia India, which is using the training facilities of its parent airline AirAsia in Malaysia, plans to set up similar facilities in India in the coming years, airline sources had said earlier.

Dynamatic has been producing Flap Track Beam assemblies for the Airbus Single Aisle (A320) aircraft family on a global single source basis since 2008 as a Tier-II supplier to Airbus. The new business award will establish Dynamatic as a Center of Excellence for the production of Flap Track Beams.

“Our cooperation and partnership with Dynamatic grows from strength to strength,”said Srinivasan Dwarakanath, Airbus India CEO, “We are delighted that with this agreement Dynamatic becomes one of the Global Tier One suppliers to Airbus.” The Flaps on the wings, which are instrumental in controlling the speed, direction and balance of the aircraft, move along high tech guide rails known as the Flap Track Beams. These Flap Track Beams are class 1 flight critical assemblies that are connected to the wings. Dynamatic Technologies will supply four out of the five Flap Track Beams per A330 wing.

“The Long Range Flap Track Beam order is a significant milestone and validates our ability to deliver high quality work in Aeronautic manufacturing” said Udayant Malhoutra, CEO and Managing Director, Dynamatic Technologies. ”Our facilities in India and the UK are completely synchronised with Airbus’s supply chain and geared to meet their expectations. It is a challenge and a great honour.“

Singapore confirms A330 MRTT buy | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Wed, 05 Mar 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vc2luZ2Fwb3JlLWNvbmZpcm1zLWEzMzAtbXJ0dC1idXkvMTEyNTY2LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Singapore will obtain the Airbus Defence & Space A330 multi-role tanker transport (MRTT), its defence ministry has confirmed.

The disclosure was made via the ministry's Cyberpioneer Twitter account, which says: ""(The) air force will replace ageing KC-135R with Airbus A330 multi-role tanker transport aircraft.”

The posting did not determine how many examples the Republic of Singapore Air Force will obtain, but Airbus has previously confirmed tabling a proposal for six of the type.

Singapore’s interest in the A330 MRTT has long been rumored. It is understood that it also had considered Boeing's in-development KC-46A tanker for the requirement.

Given Singapore's use of the Boeing F-15SG, which requires a boom for air-to-air refuelling, the country is likely to obtain its aircraft in a configuration similar to those used by the Royal Australian Air Force, which also includes a hose and drogue refuelling pod under each wing. The latter will support types including a potential future Singaporean fleet of Lockheed Martin F-35Bs.

Airbus Defence & Space

Based on the A330-200 airliner, the MRTT is capable of carrying approaching 300 passengers in an airliner-style cabin, as well as performing air-to-air refuelling duties. Singapore firm ST Aerospace has a long history of aircraft modifications and upgrades, and is well placed to perform the conversion programme for the nation's future A330 MRTT fleet.

Flightglobal's MiliCAS database records Singapore's air force as operating four KC-135Rs, using airframes originally manufactured between 1960 and 1964.

The Cybyerpioneer account also confirms Singaporean plans to obtain two additional Sikorsky S-70B maritime helicopters. Flightglobal originally reported this procurement in February 2013.

Dynamatic Technologies becomes Airbus’s Tier I supplier | Mint - Mint,"Tue, 25 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9Db21wYW5pZXMvOTNkS0tFbEt2czdTRkZBUEJEdElWUC9EeW5hbWF0aWMtVGVjaG5vbG9naWVzLWJlY29tZXMtQWlyYnVzcy1UaWVyLUktc3VwcGxpZXIuaHRtbNIBf2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9Db21wYW5pZXMvOTNkS0tFbEt2czdTRkZBUEJEdElWUC9EeW5hbWF0aWMtVGVjaG5vbG9naWVzLWJlY29tZXMtQWlyYnVzcy1UaWVyLUktc3VwcGxpZXIuaHRtbD9mYWNldD1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Mumbai: Bangalore-based Dynamatic Technologies Ltd has secured a contract to supply Toulouse-based plane maker Airbus SAS with flap track beams for long-range aircraft variants belonging to the Airbus A330 family.

This contract makes Dynamatic Technologies the first company in the Indian private sector to become a global Tier I supplier to Airbus.

The flaps on the wings, which are instrumental in controlling the speed, direction and balance of the aircraft, move along high-tech guide rails known as flap track beams.

These flap track beams are so-called “Class 1 Flight Critical Assemblies"" that are connected to the wings. Dynamatic Technologies will supply four out of five flap track beams used on every A330 aircraft wing.

The Indian company has been producing flap track beam assemblies for the Airbus single aisle (Airbus A320) aircraft family on a global single source basis since 2008 as a Tier II supplier to Airbus.

Tier I would mean Dynamatic Technologies would now directly supply beams to Airbus, becoming the first private company to do so.

On 12 March, Srinivasan Dwarakanath, chief executive officer of Airbus India, had said that Dynamatics had delivered around 10,500 beams till date.

“The long range flap track beam order is a significant milestone and validates our ability to deliver high quality work in aeronautic manufacturing"" said Udayant Malhoutra, chief executive officer and managing director, Dynamatic Technologies. Malhoutra did not disclose the value of the contract.

“This contract will enable the company to supply roughly 600 set of beams a year from 475 beams at present. Currently, the aerospace vertical has a sales of Rs215 crore and with this and two other existing contracts we are aiming to touch Rs360 crore in 24 months and Rs500 crore in 36 months,"" he said in a telephone interview.

Dwarakanath of Airbus India said his company is working with various Indian technology companies to source components from India.

To be sure, it is not just Airbus that is trying to localize component sourcing. General Electric Co. (GE) of the US is also setting up a multi-modular manufacturing facility in Pune envisaging an investment of $200 million.

“Though it is premature to make a statement that we would be manufacturing a complete aircraft engine here in Pune, we would be certainly making critical parts from this facility. Key parts of all types of aircraft engines are going to be built from this facility,"" said Nalin Jain, president and chief executive officer (South Asia) at GE’s transportation/aviation unit.

Jain said this would be a multipurpose facility producing components of aircraft engines, gas turbines, compressors for the oil and gas industry, wind turbine generators and diesel engines for locomotives. “We are in the process of deciding how we play manufacturing in India,"" Jain said.

GE’s Indian unit is setting up the facility at the Chakan industrial area near Pune over 68 acres. The firm currently has a research and development centre in Bangalore that employs more than 4,000 scientists, researchers and engineers.

The US-based aircraft engine maker Pratt and Whitney Inc. is also sourcing materials from India. “We are evaluating manufacturing components in India in future. As of now, nothing has been finalized,"" said Palash Roy Chowdhury, managing director (India) of Pratt and Whitney.

Chowdhury said his company is working with Indian companies such as Infotech Enterprises Ltd and Aequs (formerly QuEST Global Manufacturing), besides 1,500 engineers conducting high-end research for Pratt and Whitney on different aircraft engines.

Chowdhury added that his company is also closely working with the Tata Group to make helicopter cabins and partnering with institutions such as Indian Institutes of Management for research.

Plane maker The Boeing Co. of the US is also tying up with Indian companies to source components from India.

The A380 currently holds the record of being the largest commercial airliner in the world. It takes four engines to power the plane’s 5,145.1 sft of floor space that accommodates up to 800 people, 4 million little parts and 26 crew members... all through its maximum range of 15,700 kilometres.

Press photographers and onlookers simply ran for a better view as the giant stuck a near-perfect landing with her wheels screeching to bring nearly 400 tonnes to a complete halt on Begumpet airport’s limited tarmac.

Shortly after her arrival, officials from Airbus gave the Deccan Chronicle a full tour of the aircraft’s insides, of its different classes and yes, the on-board spa.

The A380’s first class promises to make trans-Atlantic travel very, very luxurious. Complete with showers, a spa and that enchanting feeling of climbing stairs inside of an airplane at 30,000 feet, the A380’s insides are completely modified. Which is why it takes up to 20 months to build and deliver one (at a price of a whopping $400 million).

The plane’s list of primary operators includes, Emirates, Singapore Airlines, Qantas and Lufthansa. Airbus are looking at India eagerly. Overall though, the aircraft, as a piece of engineering feat, is breathtaking. Which is why many were surprised Emirates was risking its precious aircraft with a landing at Begumpet.

“But this plane can land anywhere. Which is why it’s better than the 747s. Its wings are designed to land at much shorter runways and that’s why that perfect landing,” said an official from Airbus.

And that’s also how Begumpet, a two-time host to America’s Air Force One, managed to invite one more, very special guest.

Airbus Defence and Space opens state-of-the-art Mars Yard - GOV.UK,"Thu, 27 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdvdi51ay9nb3Zlcm5tZW50L25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWRlZmVuY2UtYW5kLXNwYWNlLW9wZW5zLXN0YXRlLW9mLXRoZS1hcnQtbWFycy15YXJk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Defence and Space opened a new state-of-the-art extended Mars Yard test area at its Stevenage site today. The facility was opened by Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, Vince Cable; Chief Executive of the UK Space Agency, Dr David Parker; and Director of Science and Robotic Exploration at the European Space Agency, Alvaro Giménez.

Test area 30m by 13m will facilitate final development of autonomous navigation system

Simulated Mars environment mimics conditions on the Red Planet with 300 tonnes of sand

Europe’s first Mars rover will have an unmatched capability to autonomously navigate up to 70 metres a day with no outside guidance from ground control. The rover is being developed as part of the ExoMars mission - a European mission, part funded by the UK Space Agency, to put a rover on Mars in 2019. Its aim is to examine the geological environment on Mars and search for evidence of environments that may have once, and perhaps could still, support life.

The new extended Mars Yard will provide a realistic and representative Martian environment to allow the Guidance, Navigation and Control team of the ExoMars rover project to finalise the sophisticated autonomous navigation system.

Vince Cable said: “The ExoMars rover represents the best of British high-value manufacturing. The technologies developed as part of the programme, such as autonomous navigation systems, new welding materials and techniques, will also have real impacts on other sectors, helping them stay on the cutting edge.

“Not only is it hugely exciting that Europe’s next mission to Mars will be British built, but it is incredibly rewarding to see the benefits of our investment in the European Space Agency creating jobs here in the UK.”

Alvaro Giménez said: “A facility like this enables us to develop sophisticated navigation systems to ‘teach’ Mars rovers how to drive autonomously across the Red Planet. This will be a fantastic resource for the ExoMars rover team and for future missions to come.”

Colin Paynter, Head of Airbus Defence and Space in UK added: “ExoMars is a hugely fascinating programme and the new yard brings us one step closer to launch.” The new enlarged facility is 30 metres by 13 metres, contains 300 tonnes of specially selected sand and includes design features to ensure that the environment is the closest match possible to Mars.

The walls, doors, and all interior surfaces are painted a reddish-brown colour mimicking the background colour on Mars, and the yard also includes a large mural of the Martian landscape. These features ensure the rover navigation cameras see as realistic a Martian landscape as possible.

The Mars Yard will be used up until launch and will also be kept available after the rover has landed on the surface of Mars in 2019 – if necessary to address any problem by simulating the situation on Earth. Manufacture of the flight rover will begin early in 2015 after construction of an advanced clean room for interplanetary missions at Airbus DS’s Stevenage site. Mission launch is planned for 2018."

Last month India and Dubai governments agreed to increase the seat entitlements by an additional 11,000 over the existing 54,200 seats.

""We have lived with competition and grown in a market where there is no protectionism. There are 150 airlines which fly to Dubai,'' airline's divisional senior vice president Sheikh Majid Al Maulla said responding to query on competition from Jet Airways-Etihad alliance and Qatar Airways.

""We are not looking at short term and have our growth plans,'' he added. Emirates is world's largest operator of Airbus A380s and Boeing 777s.

He said Emirates was looking atleast additional 30,000 seats to India which would enable the airline to introduce Airbus A380s and replace Airbus A330s on certain routes with Boeing777. The airline is phasing out its Airbus A330s and A340s over next two years and fears that it may have to cut down on its India operations in case additional seats are granted. It flies 185 flights per week to India now.



Emirates reported 15% network wide growth in passenger and revenue but growth in India has been lower as its capacity to India did not increase since 2009.

Emirates is yet to take a decision on adding extra flights to India and operating Airbus A380 in the summer schedule as the Dubai government is still to take a decision on allocating enhanced quota of 11,000 seats, senior airline executives said today."
"As Boeing, Airbus factories hum, suppliers get rattled - Times of Malta","Sat, 08 Mar 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZm1hbHRhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy92aWV3L0FzLUJvZWluZy1BaXJidXMtZmFjdG9yaWVzLWh1bS1zdXBwbGllcnMtZ2V0LXJhdHRsZWQuNTA5ODg00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The world’s largest plane makers are soaring these days, fuelled by historic demand for new jets that has cranked up their factories to record speeds.

But booming sales of aircraft, far from being a bonanza for suppliers, are spurring brutal competition between Airbus Group NV and Boeing Co, which are demanding better deals from the companies that make billions of parts the factories need.

GM Nameplate is one such company. The 400-employee Seattle firm makes the signs and placards posted on everything from overhead bins to emergency exits: about 1,500 signs per plane, or 1.6 million a year to Boeing alone.

As Boeing sped up jet output by 40 per cent over the last three years, it not only asked GM Nameplate to turn out more signs. It also wanted a 15 to 20 per cent price cut, said Paul Michaels, director of GMN Aerospace, the aircraft division.

“That’s huge,” Michaels said.

Boeing also wanted GMN to show it was able to meet faster production speeds, and that it had the financial health to stay in business. The company spent a week with two Boeing coaches going over its factory. Michaels says he now expects to hit the price target in 2016 and ultimately to be better off. But “it was very nerve-racking at first”.

The price pressure has left many small-tier suppliers grappling with whether to invest and grow, sell to big players or simply fold.

“It’s forcing suppliers to say either I’m in the game or out of the game,” said Christian Schiller, managing director at Cascadia Capital, a Seattle investment bank. “They can’t just stay still.”

He and others predict buyouts in the sector will rise this year as pressure grows, even though prices for small companies already are relatively high.

Since suppliers provide more than two-thirds of a jetliner’s content by value, they are obvious places for Boeing and Airbus to find cost savings. But squeezing too hard could cause production snarls and hurt an industry that is struggling to keep up with rising demand.

Airbus last week said it will notch up production of its single-aisle A320 planes by nearly 10 per cent, matching a similar move by Boeing. Both companies also are building many of their double-aisle plans at faster rates.

Boeing and Airbus make far less money selling finished planes than suppliers earn from selling parts

By 2017, Boeing and Airbus will be churning out a staggering 138 new jetliners a month. Smaller plane makers Embraer SA and Bombardier Inc also are raising output and bringing new jets to market.

As thousands of suppliers gear up, Boeing and Airbus are pitting them against each other in price competitions to drive down supplier prices more than in the past, suppliers say.

Boeing says it will put companies that don’t cut prices on a ‘no fly’ list that bars them from future work, while rewarding those do with the chance to bid on more work.

Both plane makers also are vying for a piece of the spare-parts market, demanding royalties on parts that are sold directly to airlines and never enter their factories.

Demanding lower prices in exchange for sales is a well-known tactic in other industries. Big retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Costco Wholesale Corp are famous for it. But the large price cuts now hitting suppliers are new, and are landing hard in an industry where sales volumes are relatively low.

Boeing and Airbus also make far less money selling finished planes than suppliers earn from selling parts. Boeing’s jetliner business, for example, had an operating profit margin of 10.8 per cent last year, compared with an average of about 16 per cent for suppliers. Airbus’ commercial aircraft profit margin was four per cent.

“Plane makers have a legitimate gripe,” said Tom Captain, head of the global aerospace and defence consulting practice at Deloitte.

To some extent, aircraft makers are victims of their customers, the airlines. Planes are technical marvels that operate with great precision and safety, but the flying public still demands fares that cost less than a good hotel room, and jet fuel costs are likely to remain high. So airlines are driving hard bargains to pay as little as possible for jets.

Boeing is selling some jets more aggressively, since Airbus has gained 60 percent of the market for new single-aisle planes, a market that represents more than half of the new planes to be delivered over the next 20 years.

Boeing recently launched an internal campaign to fight for market share, opening itself to more negotiations over price. But that requires driving down the cost of building planes."

In a broad-ranging deal that could help reset trade relations between China and Europe after a bumpy year, China is expected to buy more A330 passenger jets as talks advance to open Airbus’s second major factory in the country.

The “cabin completion” plant for A330s would bolster Airbus’s presence five years after the opening of its first final assembly plant outside Europe in the Chinese port city of Tianjin, where Chinese workers put together A320 jets.

The deal could also involve a decision to unfreeze the purchase of 27 A330s blocked by China during a recent row with the European Union over environmental policies.

“This visit to Europe by President Xi Jinping...will certainly beneficially promote the development of ties between China and the European Union,” China’s foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said when asked to confirm the aircraft order.

“This will be an all-round development of relations.”

A spokesman for Airbus, a subsidiary of Airbus Group, previously known as EADS, declined to comment. Spokespeople for major Chinese airlines including Air China, China Eastern and China Southern all declined to comment.

Both France and Germany are anxious to establish good ties with China’s leader and announcements on the Airbus deal package could be made in both countries, European officials said. The package could also include some A320 and A350 aircraft, people familiar with the matter said.

The sources stressed that the final size of the deal could change and would depend on last-minute talks. Previous state visits have included tough negotiations on the sidelines.

The sources declined to be named as the matter was confidential.

China remains the world’s fastest-growing aviation market despite a recent slowdown in its economy, with a surge in outbound travellers fuelling the expansion. One in four people from China travelled by plane last year, with that number set to rise to virtually the whole active population in the next two decades, Airbus says.

Airbus faces stiff competition from US arch-rival Boeing over such deals, especially for wide-body jets like the A330, an established model that Airbus is hoping to revitalise as Boeing increases output of its newer 787 Dreamliner.

Both companies are offering their aircraft at steep discounts to win China’s business, industry sources say.

Airbus is promoting a new “regional” version of the A330 aimed at China’s crowded domestic market, but Boeing hopes to persuade airlines to choose its alternatives.

Boeing also appears to have deals with China for similar quantities of jets that are not yet announced, industry sources said.

Beijing has tended in the past to balance purchases of aircraft from each of the two main foreign suppliers, especially when buying popular narrow-body models like the A320 and Boeing 737 that are most used on its crowded domestic network.

Recently, China has shown signs of decoupling strategic items like air transport from diplomatic visits, with more and more airlines announcing their deals separately and new Chinese leasing companies also making a significant mark."

AirAsia India takes delivery of first Airbus A320 - Business Standard,"Sat, 22 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzLXN0YW5kYXJkLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2NvbXBhbmllcy9haXJhc2lhLWluZGlhLXRha2VzLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LW9mLWZpcnN0LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIwLTExNDAzMjIwMDEwMF8xLmh0bWzSAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvY29tcGFuaWVzL2FpcmFzaWEtaW5kaWEtdGFrZXMtZGVsaXZlcnktb2YtZmlyc3QtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjAtMTE0MDMyMjAwMTAwXzEuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"AirAsia India, a joint venture between Tata Sons and Air Asia, took the delivery of its first Airbus A320 on Saturday.



The airline, which has got in-principle approval for importing 10 Airbus A-320 aircraft from the regulator, took delivery of the aircraft at Chennai airport at 09:30 hrs today.



The ferry flight, which was painted in red and white colour carried the wordings 'Now Everyone Can Fly' on one side and the AirAsia logo on the other, recieved a water canon salute at the Chennai airport. Ferry flight is flown from point A to B, with only the cabin crew on board.



The new Airbus A320 is equipped with Sharklets, which is a wing tip device that helps airlines reduce fuel burn and emission. Powered by CFM engines, the aircraft is configured in an all economy layout with 180 seats.



The airline will further take delivery of additional nine A320 aircraft for its Indian operations. AirAsia India’s fleet will be drawn from the 475 A320 family aircraft ordered by the AirAsia Group.



""Airasia India first aircraft arrives in India. In Chennai. Wow. Still a bit to do bit on the final straight,"" AirAsia's Chief Tony Fernandes tweeted.



Mittu Chandilya, AirAsia India CEO said, “We are fully confident that with our new A320 fleet we will provide the Indian passenger the service and convenient travel options already offered by the AirAsia Group elsewhere in the region.""



The development comes at a time when the airline is waiting to receive the air operator permit (AOP), though subjections/ objections stage has been cleared. The permit is needed to start operations.



The airline crossed its final hurdle recently, with the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) disposing off all the objections against the proposed low-cost carrier (LCC). The new LCC may get the licence within a fortnight and start flying soon.

The DGCA had received around 20 objections from the Federation of Indian airlines, BJP leader Subramanian Swamy and others. Their plea was that FDI by foreign airlines had been allowed into existing Indian airlines and not for creating JV startups.

Tata Sons has a 30% stake in the JV, AirAsia 49% and the rest by Arun Bhatia of Telestra Tradeplace. The $30-million JV was the first deal after the FDI changes were announced by the government. Post this, Tatas announced a tie-up with Singapore Airlines for forming a full-service airline.

AirAsia India said that its model will be based on low fares. Chandilya in an interview earlier had said that the airline's fares could be 25-30% less than others, while expressing hope that the airline will commence operations in May.

With Chennai as its hub, the airline would give more thrust on connecting Tier-II cities. The airline that operates A320 aircraft plans to add at least six of them in the first year, and 10, on an average, each year henceforth.

The service will commence at a time when the industry is facing pressure. According to CAPA, the start-up carriers are expected to place downward pressure on yields and risks will peak for some carriers in fiscal 2015."
"Why Garuda grounded plans for Airbus A380, Boeing 747-8 - Executive Traveller","Tue, 25 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vd2h5LWdhcnVkYS1ncm91bmRlZC1wbGFucy1mb3ItYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtYm9laW5nLTc0Ny040gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Garuda Indonesia says that the Airbus A380 and Boeing 747-8 are ‘off our roadmap because of economic reasons’ as the airline leans towards fuel-efficient twin-engine jets like the Boeing 777X, Boeing 787 and Airbus A350.

In July 2013 Garuda CEO Emirsyah Satar said the Indonesian flag-carrier expected to place an order for either the A380 or Boeing 747-8I by year’s end, with Star telling Australian Business Traveller “we are looking at both aircraft now to see which is more efficient for us.""

At the time Garuda was considering a ‘convertible’ version of both aircraft in which the business class seats could be quickly swapped out for more economy seats.

The standard two-class configuration would be used to ferry Muslims from Jakarta to Saudi Arabia during the annual Hajj and Umrah religious pilgrimages.

After a two-week transformation to an all-economy layout, which would boast a maximum capacity as high as 850 seats in the A380 superjumbo, Satar said the the converted aircraft would “fly to the Middle East and also the growing market in China and Japan” during the off-peak travel seasons outside Hajj and Umrah.

Govt support did not eventuate

However, on the sidelines of a press conference earlier this month marking Garuda’s entry into the SkyTeam alliance, Satar revealed that the airline had ruled out the big four-engine birds on economic grounds.

“At the time that the Government, the Ministry of Religious Affairs, would jointly support Garuda (in purchasing the aircraft) but this has not materialised” Satar told Australian Business Traveller.

The crux of the arrangement was the feasibility of flying the aircraft outside of the peak religious season, even in their all-economy configuration.

“The issue is basically what do we do with those seven months” Satar admitted. “We were not comfortable in terms of trying to maximise four-engine aircraft because of economic reasons, and because of that we did not finalise the A380 or Boeing 747 order.”

'Big twins' for the win

As Australian Business Traveller reported earlier this month, Satar has now set his sights on big twinjets – the Boeing 787, Airbus A350 and Boeing 777X – for the next generation of Garuda’s international fleet and expects to place a “substantial” order by the end of of this year.

“We are looking at the Dreamliner compared to the (Airbus) A350, and we are looking at the A350-1000 compared to the Boeing 777X” Satar revealed, adding that the airline would make its decision “this year” and the order numbers would be “quite substantial.”

Garuda’s fleet is slated to reach 194 aircraft by 2015, and Satar predicted total aircraft orders of more than 200 in the next 10 years if the airline meets its growth targets.

“We want to maintain a five year average (age)” Satar explained. “If there is no growth, just for 194 aircraft in the next ten years I need to order 100 (new aircraft) to replace and maintain that average.”

“But if we are talking growth it’s at least double that, at least 200 in the next ten years.”

Garuda’s biggest bird to date is the Boeing 777-300ER, with four currently in the fleet “and three more coming later this year, starting June” Satar said.

A Malaysia Airlines flight has been forced to make an emergency landing in Hong Kong.

The plane was carrying 271 people from Kuala Lumpur to South Korea but it had to make the unscheduled stop because of a technical fault involving an onboard generator.

Flight MH066 departed from Kuala Lumpur at 11.37pm yesterday (3.37pm GMT) bound for Seoul's Incheon airport.

The flight, however, was diverted to Hong Kong's international airport where it landed safely at around 3am, the airline said.

Malaysia Airlines said the Airbus A330-300 jet was diverted because of an inoperative generator. There was no loss of power because an auxiliary generator took over.

All 271 passengers were transferred to other carriers, the airline said, while the return flight from Incheon to Kuala Lumpur was cancelled.

Passengers have been transferred to other flights for the return leg.

A spokeswoman for the Hong Kong airport said the plane landed safely less than 30 minutes after it notified the airport. She said it was not classified as an emergency landing, although emergency services were put on standby.

Malaysia Airlines said in a statement: ""MH066 operated on the A330-300 aircraft, departed from Kuala Lumpur at 11.37pm and was scheduled to arrive Incheon at 6.50am local time.

""All 271 passengers from M066 have been transferred on other carriers. The return flight MH067 from Incheon to Kuala Lumpur is cancelled and passengers have been transferred on other carriers as well as subsequent Malaysia Airlines flight to Kuala Lumpur.""

Another Malaysia Airlines flight was grounded at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu after being hit by a flock of birds on March 21.

The aircraft's landing light lens cover had to be replaced - earlier reports suggested the plane's windshield had been broken but Malaysia Airlines denied this.

The incident intensifies the focus on Malaysia Airlines as the international search continues for the missing flight MH370 and the 239 people on board."

Chennai: Inching closer to launch its operations, new no-frill carrier AirAsia India today took delivery of its first Airbus A-320 as it landed in Chennai after flying in from Toulouse headquarters of the European aircraft manufacturer.

“Great news! India's latest airline, AirAsia India, has taken delivery of its first A-320 equipped with Sharklets,” Airbus tweeted with a picture of the jet painted red and the name of the airline written in white.Sharklets are the folded wing tips that helps an aircraft to glide smoothly, thereby reducing fuel burn and emission.However, the no-frill carrier, a joint venture between Malaysia's AirAsia Bhd, Tata Sons Ltd and Arun Bhatia of Telestra Tradeplace Pvt Ltd, is still awaiting a flying license from aviation regulator DGCA.The A-320, bearing call-sign VT-ATF, landed in Chennai, where the headquarters of AirAsia India is located, at around 0930 hours this morning. The plane, configured in an all- economy layout with 180 seats, was greeted with a water cannon salute as it taxied on the runway, an airline statement said.“AirAsia India family takes immense pride in welcoming home it's first aircraft which has just rolled of the manufacturing line from Toulouse”, AirAsia India's CEO Mittu Chandilya said.“The arrival of our first A320 signifies that we are a step closer to our dream to create a new benchmark in the low-cost air travel category”, he said.Earlier in a tweet on the microblogging site, he had said, “Our first iron bird just left Toulouse to come home to India. Can't wait to revolutionise Indian aviation.”AirAsia India was granted in-principle approval for the import of ten A320-200 aircraft in December last year. It plans to operate a fleet of A320-200 aircraft, initially with 4-5 planes and quickly expand it to ten within a year.In April last year, the Foreign Investment Promotion Board had approved the USD 30 million deal to launch AirAsia India, which received a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the Civil Aviation Ministry a few months later. AirAsia India's entry is expected to intensify competition in the Indian aviation industry, with the new entrant likely to offer low fares to undercut other airlines.Malaysian carrier AirAsia's group CEO Tony Fernandes said in a tweet: “Airasia India first aircraft arrives in India. In Chennai. Wow. Still a bit to do bit on the final straight.”Last month, the DGCA had dismissed a collective objection by private airlines like IndiGo, Jet Airways, SpiceJet and GoAir, to the grant of a licence to AirAsia India.They had argued that a September 2012 policy change allowing foreign airlines to invest in local airlines was applicable only to existing airlines and not new ones.DGCA had set up a three-member committee to examine the objections and concluded that it found “no reasons to put on hold the processing of the application of M/s Air Asia (India) Pvt Ltd for issuance of Air Operator Permit”.In an order, DGCA chief Prabhat Kumar had said “in view of the above, it is decided to consider the application of M/s. Air Asia (India) Pvt Ltd, for issuance of Air Operator's Permit subject to compliance of various requirements” under the law and procedures.It had also held that in view of the rapid growth of the civil aviation sector, there was “a strong need” to facilitate air traffic by encouraging the existing airlines as well as allowing new entrants so that Indian travellers could avail optimum availability of air traffic services at reasonably affordable tariffs.DGCA had sent a team of its officers to Malaysia few weeks ago to inspect and certify facilities where the start-up carrier is training its cockpit and cabin crew.AirAsia India, which is using the training facilities of its parent airline AirAsia in Malaysia, plans to set up similar facilities in India in the coming years, airline sources had said earlier."

Police escorting resources are being provided by volunteer police officers on rest days, paid for by the haulier at no cost to the public.

The load was due to move on February 9 but this was cancelled due to extremely windy weather."

The latest generation of Airbus apprentices have been commended at the company’s recent Recognition of Learning awards.

The event was held at Chester Racecourse last Thursday and saw more than 80 of Broughton’s learners receive an award for their continuous hard work and dedication to their studies.

Describing the apprentices as ‘the future leaders of Airbus’, general manager and human resources director Mark Stewart told guests that the learners were ‘glowing examples of individuals who have grown and excelled’.

He said: “You are the ones who will take over from us.

“You will carry that baton for years to come and I hope you continue to grow and overcome any hurdles.

“We wish you every success in Airbus and the Airbus group.”

During the evening, those studying apprenticeships in aircraft electricals, aircraft fitting, higher engineering, higher supply chain and aerospace engineering were called onto the stage to collect an award.

Special praise was also given to Rhys Vincent and Devon Sumner who were named best performing apprentices in first and second year, as well as Alex Birbeck which was presented with the Trefor Jones Award after being named best third year performer.

Dan Holland, of Wirral was named Apprentice of the Year 2013.

Clwyd South AM Ken Skates, the Deputy Minister for Skills and Technology, was also present at the event.

He said: “It was a fantastic evening and Airbus is a fantastic company, truly one of the jewels in our crown here in North Wales and an exemplar to others in terms of apprenticeships.

“Apprenticeship programmes are key to building better companies, stronger economies and brighter futures, and Airbus continues to lead the way in this field.”

He told the apprentices: “You are our future and my goodness, we are proud.”

Mr Skates, who grew up in North East Wales, also spoke on the importance of Airbus to both the local and national economy and to employment in the area.

He mentioned the loss of Shotton steelworks during the 1980s, describing how it ‘sucked the life out of Deeside’ and how Airbus has helped to repair the damage caused by its closure.

Special thanks was paid to Lord Barry Jones for his efforts to try and save the steelworks, as well as for his ongoing support to Airbus.

Paul McKinlay said to him in his speech: “To date there are just under 6,000 people employed at Broughton and I don’t think there would be without your support.”

Lord Jones commented: “An event such as this is a milestone in the Flintshire community and an acknowledgement of the splendid apprentice army.

“Each apprentice is highly motivated, highly trained, considerably experienced and raring to go.

“There is a great mix of youth, confidence and skill – they will project the great Airbus company forward for generations ahead with their excellence, high achievements and honourable ambition.”"
Qatar deploys hi-tech border security system| Gulf Times - Gulf Times,"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmd1bGYtdGltZXMuY29tL3N0b3J5LzM4NjAyNS9xYXRhci1kZXBsb3lzLWhpLXRlY2gtYm9yZGVyLXNlY3VyaXR5LXN5c3RlbdIBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmd1bGYtdGltZXMuY29tL3N0b3J5LzM4NjAyNS9xYXRhci1kZXBsb3lzLWhpLXRlY2gtYm9yZGVyLXNlY3VyaXR5LXN5c3RlbS9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HE the Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa al-Thani briefed on the latest maritime technologies and naval d

A state-of-the-art border security system for the National Security Shield (NSS) is now up and running in Qatar, European firm Airbus Defence & Space announced at the Doha International Maritime Defence Exhibition & Conference (Dimdex 2014).

Airbus Defence & Space senior vice president, head of Europe, Middle East and Africa Jean-Marc Nasr said the company had finalised the deployment of the advanced security system to the Qatar Ministry of Interior and Armed Forces.

“I am pleased to say that in this country we have put in operation the most advanced border surveillance system ever developed in the world for maritime and terrestrial areas,” Nasr said during a presentation delivered at the Qatar National Convention Centre (QNCC), the venue for this year’s Dimdex.

Nasr, who described the security programme as “the most evolved solution worldwide,” said the system is composed of surveillance towers and surveillance vehicles equipped with different sensors such as radars, cameras and direction finders that are distributed throughout Qatar.

“Our company has developed a unique capability of putting that together in an integrated manner to provide a level of efficiency and reliability that is expected by very demanding border guards and that’s the beauty of what we are doing,” Nasr told Gulf Times.

He said the Qatar Border Guards and Coast Guards are now capable of monitoring land sectors, coastal border sectors, offshore sites, and 600km of Qatari borders that are prone to security threats like human trafficking, illegal migration, terrorist attacks, piracy, illegal fishing, and smuggling.

Aside from border and coast guards, the surveillance system can also be utilised by other military sectors like the navy, air force, land force, and even government agencies, Nasr said.

“All sensor data and images,” according to Nasr, “can be accessed from any of Qatar’s operational sites.”

He also stressed that the border security systems are operational “24 times 7” and can be used “in all kinds of weather conditions and in all kinds of situations.”

Nasr emphasised that the offshore towers and platforms that will be installed and equipped with the NSS will also cover Qatar’s exclusive economic zone, thus providing added protection to the country’s oil and gas production sites.

He added that in the next two years, additional functionalities such as a training simulation system, documentation management, a web portal for external agencies, and an enhanced user management will be delivered to further enhance the system.

Nasr explained that the construction of the Alternative Joint Operational Centre is still being finalised. “It will be integrated and able to take over all operations at any time. The air force, the Land Force Headquarters, and the National Crisis Centre will be connected to the system in the coming months,” he said."

She’d probably be as surprised as the passengers on a recent Qantas flight when the double-decker Airbus A380 sprung a leak, sending water coursing through the cabin.

Water was reportedly flowing down aisles and trickling down on the heads of passengers, forcing the plane to return to L.A. late Tuesday night, officials and passengers said, according to the Associated Press.

The flight landed safely after an hour in the air, Qantas said, adding that there were no safety concerns with the leak and the pilot only turned the plane around because well, it couldn’t be very comfortable for customers to sit and soak on a trans-Pacific flight.

While some passengers were moved to dryer areas after water flowed down the stairs and dripped onto passengers in the lower deck, that was only a stopgap measure.

“You couldn’t keep going like that for 15 hours,” one passenger reportedly told KABC-TV.

Passengers stayed overnight in a hotel while other flight arrangements were made, ostensibly for planes that don’t have leaks.

Meanwhile, Qantas says it’s investigating the issue with the plane, and what caused the leak.

Airbus was originally a consortium of various different aviation companies in Europe (such as France’s Sud Aviation and the British Aircraft Corporation).

The idea of Airbus stems from a meeting in July, 1967, where ministers from France, Germany and Britain agreed “for the purpose of strengthening European co-operation in the field of aviation technology and thereby promoting economic and technological progress in Europe, to take appropriate measures for the joint development and production of an airbus.”

The three countries basically decided to create Airbus because Europe was significantly trailing behind America in the aircraft industry.

In 1969 the French transport minister Jean Chamant came to an agreement with German economics minister Karl Schiller to launch the world’s first twin-engine **widebody passenger jet, the A300.

** A widebody aircraft has two passenger aisles, whilst a narrow-body aircraft has just one aisle.

Airbus Industrie was formally established as a Groupement d’Interet Économique (Economic Interest Group or GIE) in 1970.

The first production model of the A300 entered service in 1974 and the consortium had 256 orders for model by 1979.

The A300 was a success, although Airbus did not really make a big presence in the aircraft industry until it launched the A320 model in 1981.

There were four partners that jointly manufactured the aircrafts. British Aerospace producing the wings, Daimler-Benz Aerospace produced the fuselage, Spain’s Construcciones Aeronauticas SA produced parts of the tail, and France’s Aerospatiale produced the cockpits and assembled the aircrafts.

In 1996 the CEO of Airbus, Jean Pierson, strongly believed that Airbus ought to be established as a conventional company, as opposed to a GIE.

However it was not until 2000 that a new integrated company, called Airbus SAS (Societé par Actions Simplifieé) began operations, with The Airbus Group as its parent company. The Airbus Group was created following a merger between Aérospatiale-Matra, Daimler Chrysler Aerospace AG (DASA), and Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA).
