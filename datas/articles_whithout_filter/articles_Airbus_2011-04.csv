Airbus introduces new standard of modular galleys on A320 Family product line for added customer value - Airbus,"Wed, 06 Apr 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxMS0wNC1haXJidXMtaW50cm9kdWNlcy1uZXctc3RhbmRhcmQtb2YtbW9kdWxhci1nYWxsZXlzLW9uLWEzMjAtZmFtaWx50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

Driessen-Zodiac Aerospace to become sole galley and stowage supplier for A320 Family

Airbus and Driessen-Zodiac Aerospace, a company of the Zodiac Aerospace Group, have signed an agreement on progressively introducing galleys as Seller Furnished Equipment (SFE*) on the A320 Family, with Driessen-Zodiac Aerospace as the selected vendor.The offer is based on a modular concept, optimizing the initial configuration and easing later re-configurations, which facilitates the re-marketability of the aircraft. Airline-customers will also benefit from pre-assigned customer support conditions, complementing the existing support of the Airbus’ Customer Services for all SFE cabin equipment.“The A320 Family is the most successful product family on the market with an order-backlog of over 2400 aircraft and constantly increasing production rates. This new supply model will improve the robustness of the supply chain by developing a close partnership with one strong supplier,” says Daniel Baubil, Airbus Executive Vice President A320 Family Program.The Driessen-Zodiac Aerospace supplied galleys and stowages will offer flexibility for airline-specific configurations, described in a catalogue. The new SFE approach will start with deliveries from mid 2012 on.* Historically galleys have been Buyer Furnished Equipment (BFE) on the A320 Family, with customers themselves responsible for on-time, on-quality delivery of equipment to the Airbus Finals Assembly Lines. The new SFE approach moves the program management responsibility to Airbus."

KENNER — First there was a report of smoke in the cockpit shortly after this morning's takeoff. Then the pilot of United Airlines Flight 497 from New Orleans to San Francisco reported instruments had stopped working, even as he requested a runway for his return.

Less than 13 minutes after its departure, the Airbus 320 landed with all 100 passengers and five crew of Flight 497 safely at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, United spokesman Rahsaan Johnson said.

Copilot Ronald Lee Young told an Associated Press reporter aboard the plane that he landed on backup systems, with minimal steering and braking ability, after the plane lost all electronics.

A pilot can be heard on an air traffic recording, saying about 4 ½ minutes into the flight, that he needed to return to the airport: ""... We got a, uh, smoke, uh, issue with the airplane.""

He requested the longest runway. But that runway, just over 1.9 miles long, had been closed Monday for construction work on the shoulder, airport spokeswoman Michele Wilcut said afterward. ""You just can't move construction equipment that fast,"" she said.

About 5 ½ minutes in, the pilot states, ""We are declaring an emergency. And please roll equipment for our landing, please.""

At 7:13 a.m., 6 minutes after takeoff, the tower asks if the pilot could use a shorter runway, 1.3 miles long.

Minutes later, the pilot radios again, still sounding calm: ""We've lost all our instruments right now.""

It's rare to lose the electronics, but backup instruments worked as the plane came to a stop with 2,000 feet to spare after only its nose wheel ran off the pavement, said spokesman Lynn Lunsford of the Federal Aviation Administration.

Immediately after the landing, flight attendants shouted, ""Leave everything. Get out!""

Passengers slid down the front and back inflatable slides. A few passengers walked to an ambulance after a call for anyone with injuries. The injuries appeared to be minor, such as abrasions from the slide.

Lunsford said the FAA is investigating. The National Transportation Safety Board issued a statement that it had sent a team and a preliminary report was expected within 10 working days.

Online FAA records show the plane was built in 1994.

Posted: 30 April 2011 | Virgin Atlantic |

Virgin Atlantic has launched its second Airbus A330 aircraft from London Gatwick, the first time the airline has operated this aircraft type from its Gatwick base…

Holidaymakers will take to the skies on 1st May to Orlando, Florida.

The aircraft is a long range twin engine aircraft and is the most efficient aircraft in its class today. The new plane will use 15% less fuel per seat than the airline’s A340-300 aircraft, delivering Virgin Atlantic’s commitment to flying a lower carbon fleet.

This second A330 aircraft to join the fleet and is part of a $2.2bn order of 10 new A330s that will be delivered over the next two years enabling the airline to take more passengers to key markets including US East Coast, East and West Africa, the Middle East and India. The first A330 launched on 2nd April from Manchester to Orlando.

The new A330 aircraft features a revolutionary new IFE system by Panasonic. The new cutting edge system uses the latest touch screen technology which allows passengers to scroll and swipe through over 300 hours of content quickly and easily. Later this year Virgin Atlantic travellers flying on the A330 will be able to send and receive emails and texts on their Blackberries, handheld PDAs and other mobile devices.

Corneel Koster, Director of Operations, Safety and Security, commented:

“I am very proud to welcome ‘Mademoiselle Rouge’ to Gatwick today. We are hoping passengers travelling on this new aircraft to Orlando will enjoy the new in flight entertainment system. With over 300 hours of movies, award winning TV shows, music and games we are sure holidaymakers flying from Gatwick today will love having this cutting edge technology at their fingertips.”

Virgin Atlantic’s first two A330 aircraft will operate on leisure routes and will have 59 Premium Economy seats and 255 Economy seats. The remaining A330-300 aircraft will be configured in the airline’s three classes: Upper Class, Premium Economy and Economy.

Virgin Atlantic Virgin Atlantic flies to 32 destinations worldwide including New York, Boston, Washington DC, Miami, San Francisco & Los Angeles, Delhi, Shanghai, Tokyo, Dubai, Lagos and Nairobi as well as many Caribbean destinations."
"Air France Wreckage Found - The Wave - The Wave, Rockaway's Newspaper Since 1893","Fri, 08 Apr 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvY2thd2F2ZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvYWlyLWZyYW5jZS13cmVja2FnZS1mb3VuZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Underwater search teams have found pieces of an Air France Airbus 330 that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the shore of Brazil in 2009, killing all 228 people aboard, French investigators have announced.

The Air France jetliner, designated as Flight 447 plunged into the ocean en route from Rio to Paris. The latest search found a section of the aircraft, including bodies, and raised hopes that the black boxes will be found to explain what happened.

Experts in the United States say that the crash may have some relevance to the crash of American Airlines Flight 587 into Belle Harbor streets on November 12, 2001. The aircraft, both in the Airbus A300 Series of aircraft, have virtually identical tail surfaces and rudder control systems.

Investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board ruled that AA 587 crashed because the first officer, who was flying the departure from John F. Kennedy Airport, over controlled the rudder system, causing the tail to depart from the aircraft. The entire tail was found floating in Jamaica Bay shortly after the crash.

Photos of the tail from Air France Flight 447 being pulled out of the Atlantic Ocean this week were reminiscent of the photos taken in Jamaica Bay, a former pilot told The Wave.

Parts of the wreckage of an Air France plane found in the Atlantic on the weekend contain the bodies of some of the passengers who died when the aircraft crashed off Brazil in 2009, the French government said on Monday.

The latest search, the fourth since the crash, is being carried out using a salvage vessel equipped with unmanned submarines. An initial underwater search had also found parts of wreckage and bodies.

France’s BEA accident investigation authority said on Sunday it had found a large part of the plane’s wreckage including the engine and parts of the fuselage, and Environment Minister Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet said on Monday there were human remains inside.

“We have more than just traces, we have bodies … Identification is possible,” she told France Info radio.

Transport Minister Thierry Mariani said victims’ families would be informed of the findings at a meeting at the end of the week and no further details would be made public before then.

“It’s true that bodies have been seen, but given the sensitive nature of the subject we prefer to keep certain details for the families,” he told France Info radio.

The discovery of the chunks of the Air France wreckage in a vast search radius of some 10,000 square kilometers, has raised hopes that the aircraft’s flight recorders, or black boxes, might now be found.

Finding the cause took on new importance last month when a French judge filed preliminary manslaughter charges against Air France and the plane’s manufacturer, Airbus. Experts say without the flight data and voice recorders, authorities will not likely determine what was at fault.

Air France and Airbus are financing the estimated $12.5 million cost of the new search. About $28 million has already been spent on the three previous searches for the jet’s wreckage."

Kennedy International Airport is underscoring worries about ground accidents as U.S. airports begin handling a new generation of giant planes.

A total of 586 passengers and crew members were aboard the two aircraft Monday night when the left wing of an Air France Airbus A380 clipped a Bombardier CRJ-700 regional jet flown by Comair, spinning the smaller plane nearly 90 degrees.

No one was injured, but the impact tore open the leading edge of the Airbus’ left wing and broke off half the wing fence, a vertical fin that sticks out from the wingtip. The Bombardier had a hole in its rudder and a dent on the leading edge of its tail.

Audio of the collision indicates the Comair plane, which had just arrived from Boston, was trying to exit the taxiway as the France-bound Airbus made its way to the runway.

The superjumbo Airbus is so immense — as tall as a seven-story building, with a wingspan as wide as a Manhattan block — that its wing almost cleared the smaller plane. But not quite.

“It’s the sheer size of these aircraft and the congestion at these airports that’s the problem,” said Allan Tamm, a consultant with Avicor Aviation, based in Portland, Ore. “It’s a serious concern for all these airports trying to accommodate these aircraft. It’s going to happen more and more.”

Most U.S. airports cannot legally handle the A380 or the new Boeing 747-8 — which falls into the same new size class as the A380 — because of the Federal Aviation Administration space requirements aimed at keeping planes from bumping into one another. But the FAA can issue waivers if airport officials agree to certain procedures, such as using only certain taxiways or halting other traffic when one of these mammoth planes is on the move.

Fourteen airports, including Denver International, have obtained waivers from the FAA to receive the 747-8. And Boeing is working with 13 more airports to get approval.

Many of the airports asking for permission may have trouble handling the 747-8, especially when it is turning, Tamm said.

“A lot of these airports are only marginally ready,” he said.

The flurry of new waivers coincides with an increase in air traffic as the U.S. economy recovers. The number of passengers flying in the U.S. increased from 767 million in 2009 to 782 million in 2010.

JFK was built in the 1950s, when jets were smaller. Airport officials had to secure FAA waivers for the A380 and the 747-8. Monday’s collision might spur the FAA to take a second look at JFK’s rules for handling large aircraft.

“This wasn’t just two airplanes bumping together. The Air France plane really creamed the regional jet,” said Bill Voss, president of the Flight Safety Foundation, an advocacy group.

The Delta flight, which had just landed from Boston, was a connection to JFK for many London passengers. Those onboard exited onto the tarmac.

“The plane was rocking, first to the right, then to the left,” said Delta passenger Sebastien Pinel, 33, a teacher from London. “Nobody knew what happened until we got out of the plane,” he added.

“It almost tipped over,” said Jennifer, a London teacher who declined to give her last name. “If ever there was an advert for keeping your seat belt on once you’ve landed, this was it.”

The incident will be investigated, officials said, and both planes will be inspected for damage. The Airbus can hold up to 800 passengers, while the Comair holds about 100.

INTERIORS: Airbus Space-Flex concept could add three seats to A320 - Flightglobal,"Tue, 05 Apr 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaW50ZXJpb3JzLWFpcmJ1cy1zcGFjZS1mbGV4LWNvbmNlcHQtY291bGQtYWRkLXRocmVlLXNlYXRzLXRvLWEzMjAvOTkyMDAuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus today unveils its innovative Space-Flex lavatory and galley concept which could enable some A320-family operators to fit an extra three seats on board their aircraft.

The new design replaces the A320's full-width rear galley with a smaller galley together with two lavatories that were previously located forward of the twinjet's rear passenger doors. The space vacated by moving the lavatories rearwards is taken up by a second small galley area on the right-hand side and an extra row of three seats on the left-hand side, boosting revenue potential for airlines.

""It's something we have been studying for all members of the A320 family,"" says Airbus head of interiors marketing Bob Lange (pictured below). ""We are using space in the aircraft that was previously unused.""

An added benefit is that because the relocated lavatories are next to each other, they can be easily converted into a single, larger enclosure to provide access for wheelchair users - a facility that up until now has only been available on widebodied aircraft.

Airbus has worked on the concept with a handful of airlines but aims to use this week's show to gather feedback on its Space-Flex mock-up from a wider selection of carriers. The manufacturer expects to decide in the second half of this year whether to launch Space-Flex commercially, for first deliveries from around 2014, says Lange. The concept would be offered for retrofit as well as to equip new aircraft as it does not require any any structural modifications.

Lange says he does not anticipate the splitting of the rear galley into two sections to adversely impact onboard service provision. ""The testing we have done so far with airlines indicates that it's certainly not a problem,"" he says.

Space-Flex will mainly benefit scheduled carriers operating with two-class cabin configurations as the approximately 30% of the A320 fleet operated by low-cost carriers already has the maximum number of seats allowed, and therefore cannot accommodate the extra three seats.

""We would offer this as an option - but most carriers would take it up,"" says Lange. He adds that the tentative 2014 in-service date for Space-Flex could be brought forward ""if we see very strong market interest"".

According to the NTSB, shortly after takeoff an automated system warned the crew of smoke in the equipment bay. But “preliminary examination has not revealed any signs of burning, indications of smoke or other anomalous system findings,” according to the NTSB. Plus, the agency says neither the captain or copilot recalled smelling smoke or fumes during the flight and pre-interview reports suggest the cabin crew didn’t smell or see smoke, either. What we know is that the aircraft had issued an autothrottle-related message, followed by the avionics smoke warning, which included instructions to land. The captain says he followed the relevant checklist, which led him to shut down some of the aircraft’s electrical systems. And then things got more interesting.

After following the checklist, the first officer’s displays were blank, the automated messages disappeared, the cockpit-to-cabin intercom didn’t work and the air-driven emergency generator deployed. The captain took control of the aircraft and turned back for New Orleans, requesting Runway 10/28, the airport’s longest runway. Controllers told the crew the runway was unavailable due to the presence of maintenance vehicles. The flight ultimately landed on Runway 19, from which it had departed 12 minutes earlier, but not before the crew’s declaration that “we’ve lost all our instruments.” The aircraft landed safely, but the nosewheel departed the left side of the runway. Passengers were evacuated via the aircraft’s slides. The NTSB will be conducting formal interviews of cabin crew, poring over cockpit voice recordings and sifting through more than 25 hours of information from the aircraft’s flight data recorder.

An Airbus jet has been captured by an amateur cameraman crashing into the back of a smaller passenger jet on the runway at JFK airport, New York.

The Air France Airbus Superjumbo, the world’s biggest passenger aircraft, caught the tail section of the Comair Bombardier CRJ regional jet, dragging it down the runway slightly and turning it almost 90 degrees from its original position.

The huge passenger plane’s pilot misjudged its taxiing space. According to NBC News the pilot of the smaller aircraft radioed: “Roll emergency trucks… We’ve been hit by – ugh – Air France.” The Comair jet was carrying 62 people on a commuter flight from Boston. The Air France jet was bound for Paris.

An Air France Airbus A380, a multidecked aircraft with a capacity that can exceed 800 passengers, was on Taxiway A at 8:08 p.m., an FAA official said, when its left wing clipped the tail of a Comair Bombardier Canadian Regional Jet CRJ7, with a 120-passenger capacity.

Paris-bound Air France Flight 7 was on the main runway, and the regional jet, Comair Flight 629, had just come in from Boston, the FAA said. Comair is owned by Delta Air Lines.

Jim Peters, an FAA spokesman, said, ""The FAA will investigate what happened. We don't know why one aircraft struck the other.""

The regional jet was on Taxiway M, which intersects with Taxiway A, Peters said. The number of passengers and flight crew members was not immediately available, he said, but everyone on both planes exited at JFK and the Airbus flight was canceled."
'Human error' blamed in JFK jet 'crash'; Air France Airbus 380 jet hits Delta Comair airplane - New York Daily News,"Sun, 17 Apr 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueWRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMS8wNC8xNy9odW1hbi1lcnJvci1ibGFtZWQtaW4tamZrLWpldC1jcmFzaC1haXItZnJhbmNlLWFpcmJ1cy0zODAtamV0LWhpdHMtZGVsdGEtY29tYWlyLWFpcnBsYW5lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON – Last week’s scary taxiway mishap at JFK International Airport was the result of “human error,” Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said Sunday.

But LaHood didn’t say whether pilot error or air traffic controller error caused the massive Air France 380 jumbo jet to clip the wing of a small Delta regional commuter jet.

The investigation is continuing, LaHood told “Fox News Sunday.” Some aviation experts have said it was miraculous nobody was injured on either plane.

LaHood was on television hoping to limit the damage to the feds from the embarrassing recent string of air traffic controllers falling asleep on duty, forcing pilots in some cases to land planes on their own.

The latest of six sleeping incidents this year occurred in Miami over the weekend.

“I don’t know when I’ve ever been madder. I’m outraged about this,” LaHood said. “We’re doing everything we can 24-7 to correct this problem.”

LaHood announced that air traffic controllers will now have nine hours off being shifts instead of eight and won’t be allowed to trade shifts in order to give themselves longer weekends off.

Supervisors will also be on duty longer at air traffic control centers and towers.

The Federal Aviation Administration official in charge of air traffic control operations resigned last week, and Congress is demanding to know why the narcoleptic outbursts weren’t fixed months ago.

LaHood said controllers have to take more “personal responsibility” on the job and ruled out the practice of some countries to allow controllers built-in nap time during their shifts.

“On my watch controllers are not going to be paid to take naps,” he vowed.

Although homeland security operations isn’t on his watch, LaHood added that as the grandfather of nine he wasn’t thrilled by the recent vigorous patdown of a 6-year-old girl

Video footage has emerged from the moment an A380 jumbo jet collided with a smaller passenger plane at JFK airport, causing it to spin violently.

The amateur recording captures the moment the wing of the 525-seat Air France plane smashed into the tail fin of the Comair CRJ carrying 62 passengers forcing it to turn by 90 degrees.

Eye witnesses said they saw damage to one of the wings of the A380 which has been taken in for inspection.

Crash: The Air France moments before impacting the much smaller Comair CRJ business type jet

...moments later the smaller jet is spun 90 degrees...

...before coming to a rest after being tossed around like a toy on the tarmac at JFK

Air accident investigators have launched an inquiry to find out how the incident occurred at 8.09pm local time.

No passengers or crew were reported to have been injured in the crash, but some onboard described feeling the impact.

The Super-Jumbo A380 in Stats

Cost: $375.3 million Passengers: 525 people in three-class configuration or up to 853 people in all-economy class Space: 5,146 square feet of floor space; 49% more than the current next-largest airliner, the Boeing 747-400 with 3,453 square feet The Airbus A380 made its maiden flight on 27 April 2005 from Toulouse, France, and made its first commercial flight on 25 October 2007 from Singapore to Sydney with Singapore Airlines

Flying to Paris on the Air France flight, a correspondent for US broadcaster CNN said he felt a 'slight rumble akin to hitting a patch of rough pavement.'

He also said that about a foot of the Air France superjumbo's left wing was visibly damaged.

Communication from the John F. Kennedy airport's ground control records suggest that the A380 was instructed to go to a runway and was cleared to turn left onto a taxiway to wait.

They gave way to another plane heading in the opposite direction but less than a minute later the pilots of the Comair CRJ told controllers: 'Send a truck, they just hit us at (taxiway) Mike,' according to flightglobal.com.

An Air France spokesman said: 'Air France confirms an A380 operating flight 007 on April 11 between JFK and Paris-Charles de Gaulle, with 495 passengers and 25 crew on board, struck with its left wing the tail of a Comair CRJ-700 which was parking at JFK.

Damaged: The Airbus A380 sits on the tarmac at JFK, too badly damaged to fly

Clipped: The wing tip of the Airbus A380 can be seen here clearly damaged by the impact with the smaller aircraft

'This collision caused only material damage. The two aircraft have been immobilised and the passengers were given accommodation or placed on (other) flights.'

Air France, Europe's largest airline has four Airbus superjumbos in its fleet but has switched to a smaller aircraft on flights to Tokyo due to a drop in demand following last month's Japan earthquake, leaving spare capacity to replace the A380 on New York trips.

It is due to take delivery of two more A380s in coming weeks and plans to add Washington, Montreal and San Francisco to its A380 network that includes New York, Tokyo and Johannesburg. Air France says it plans to restore Tokyo A380 flights in September."

A 51 year-old man suffered an heart attack shortly after takeoff from Singapore. But Singapore Airlines did not divert to the nearest available airport, and instead continued its 14-hour flight to London.

Max Pearson, who happens to be a BBC radio host, was on his flight back from reporting about the tsunami in Japan. He went into cardiac arrest on the flight that landed on March 18. The story is surfacing just now, as Pearson is considering suing the airline.

(More on TIME.com: Southwest’s Scare: When a Plane Decompresses, What Happens?)

The crew of the Singapore-London flight did not deem his occurrence severe enough for the flight to be diverted. A fellow passenger, reportedly a doctor, took care of him during the flight. Singapore Airlines said in a statement:

With regards to in-flight medical emergencies, our general standard procedure after ascertaining that a passenger is unwell is to broadcast over the PA system a request for medical assistance on board, and to contact our ground-based telemedical service provider, MedAire.

An in-flight diversion may be carried out based on medical recommendations. Our pilots will take considerations, including the recommendation of MedAire, into account on whether to divert to the nearest suitable airport with medical facilities.

Where necessary, we would arrange for additional medical support on the ground to be made available as soon as the aircraft touches down.

Upon landing in London, Pearson was immediately transferred to an hospital where he received life-saving surgery. But, the Daily Mail reports, he’s been left with permanent heart damage.

FAA: JFK runway was smaller than required - Newsday,"Wed, 13 Apr 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NkYXkuY29tL25ld3MvbmV3LXlvcmsvZmFhLWpmay1ydW53YXktd2FzLXNtYWxsZXItdGhhbi1yZXF1aXJlZC1wNjY2ODHSAVlodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzZGF5LmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9uZXcteW9yay9mYWEtamZrLXJ1bndheS13YXMtc21hbGxlci10aGFuLXJlcXVpcmVkLXA2NjY4MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Federal Aviation Administration records show the agency allowed the Airbus A380 double-decker jet to use a smaller taxiway at Kennedy Airport than its regulations normally require.

An A380 was involved in a crash with a regional jet Monday night at the Queens airport. More than 500 people aboard the Air France A380 and nearly 60 on the Comair regional jet escaped injury.

The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident, which was captured on amateur video.

The impact caused the smaller plane to spin nearly 90 degrees.

The big jet was rolling down a taxiway and the regional jet was stopped, waiting to park at a Delta terminal gate.

NTSB investigators will no doubt examine the waiver granted to the Port Authority, which operates Kennedy Airport. FAA rules required that the hulking A380 travel on a taxiway at least 100 feet wide, but the agency allowed a taxiway 75 feet wide at the airport, according to FAA records.

Investigators also will review the amateur video that captured the left wing of the A360, the world's largest passenger plane, as it clipped the left horizontal stabilizer at the regional jet's tail.

A truck is visible passing in front of the stopped regional jet before the A380 hits it.

""We look at everything,"" said Keith Holloway, a spokesman for the NTSB in Washington.

The A380 has a wingspan of more than 260 feet, nearly the length of a football field.

""That's one of the things that the NTSB will be focusing on,"" said John M. Cox, president of Safe Operating Systems in Washington and a former US Airways pilot.

""Where is the breakdown that allowed these two planes to come together? It should have never have happened.""

Ground radar, the special protocols for the A380 and a see-and-avoid instruction to pilots still couldn't prevent the crash.

Most U.S. airports can't handle either the A380 or the Boeing 787-800 due to FAA ground separation requirements.

However, the FAA can grant waivers as long as airport operators follow certain restrictions, like keeping the large jets on specific taxiways and holding other traffic when the jumbo jet is taxiing.

The FAA granted the waiver based on an analysis of taxiway centerline deviations, which found just 27 times a jet steered off the centerline by more than 10 feet among 4,737 observations.

The low number was attributed in part to bad weather, with more than half the deviations greater than 10 feet occurring on the same bad-weather day, according to the FAA.

Changing the taxiways at Kennedy Airport to meet the existing FAA's 100-foot width rule would require reconstruction of pavement and temporarily closing taxiways, the Port Authority's waiver application says.

""Such closures would be operationally disruptive to airlines due to the high volume of activity at JFK and would potentially result in increased delays,"" the application states."

New images have emerged of the damage caused when an Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger plane, collided with a much smaller aircraft in New York.



The Air France plane clipped the smaller regional jet sending it into a violent spin at JFK Airport in New York on Tuesday evening.

Nobody was injured in the collision but aviation experts revealed that the damage was worse than first thought and raised questions about safety.

Smashed: The wingtip of the Airbus A380 is bent and has a large section of material missing that was ripped off in the collision at JFK Airport in New York on Tuesday

Damage: A large section of material has been ripped from the wingtip of the jumbo jet while there is a hole in the tail of the smaller jet after the collision at JFK Airport in New York on Tuesday evening



Pictures of both planes the morning after the crash show metal that has been ripped from the wing of the Airbus and a larger hole in the smaller plane.

The fragments of the jumbo jet's wing were scattered across the tarmac where the planes were parked.



'This wasn't just two air planes bumping together. The Air France plane really creamed the regional jet,' said Bill Voss, president of the Flight Safety Foundation, an industry funded group that promotes global aviation safety.



Danger: Air France said 485 passengers and 25 crew members were aboard the Paris-bound Flight 7 while the smaller jet was carrying 62 passengers and four crew members

'This is not something that happens every day. This is not normal.'

The Airbus A380 was taxiing out to a runway when its left wingtip crashed into the tail of the Bombardier CRJ700 regional jet, operated by Comair for Delta Air Lines and stopped on an intersecting taxiway, whipping the smaller plane around nearly 90 degrees.

Hole: A view from the ground looking up shows how a large chunk of metal was pulled from the smaller plane's tail

Air France said 485 passengers and 25 crew members were aboard the Paris-bound Flight 7. The flight operated by Comair was carrying 62 passengers and four crew members.

The National Transportation Safety Board will investigate, board spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said.

An audio recording of conversations between the JFK controller responsible for coordinating the movement of planes on the tarmac and the two aircraft indicates that the Comair plane was trying to exit the taxiway but may have stopped short because of congestion on the ramp, Voss said.

'Both pilots and controllers would have been confronted with sea of flashing lights and reflections which could partly explain why the Air France pilot may not have seen the regional jet,' Voss said.

The superjumbo Airbus is so big, its wing nearly had enough clearance to make it over the smaller plane - but not quite.

Voss said that working ground control at a busy airport like JFK is one of the most demanding jobs in the nation's air traffic control system,

'It is extremely complex, highly visual and the workload can become almost superhuman, ' he added.

Flying to Paris on the Air France flight, a correspondent for US broadcaster CNN said he felt a 'slight rumble akin to hitting a patch of rough pavement.'

He also said that about a foot of the Air France superjumbo's left wing was visibly damaged.

Communication from the John F. Kennedy airport's ground control records suggest that the A380 was instructed to go to a runway and was cleared to turn left onto a taxiway to wait.

From RAF to Airbus: one man's move into lean management - GOV.UK,"Thu, 14 Apr 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdvdi51ay9nb3Zlcm5tZW50L25ld3MvZnJvbS1yYWYtdG8tYWlyYnVzLW9uZS1tYW5zLW1vdmUtaW50by1sZWFuLW1hbmFnZW1lbnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Having served in the RAF for just over ten years, specialising as an Aircraft Engineer (Avionics), Corporal Guy Dixon, 35, says that a variety of reasons lay behind his decision to leave:

To seek new challenges in a new career, to use the knowledge and experience I had gained, and in pursuit of a more settled family life, with the opportunity to own a home and put down roots, and to fulfil my desire to emigrate to France.

His Service locations included 101 Squadron, RAF Brize Norton, and Electrical Engineering Squadron and Quality and Continuous Improvement Team (QCIT), RAF Marham, and while in uniform he was awarded the Commander-in-Chief’s commendation as part of the Tornado Lean Team, presented by Chief of the Air Staff.

The Service’s legacy - his time in the RAF - has equipped him well, says Guy, with skills and experience that he now finds useful in civilian life:

Aircraft engineering training, and knowledge of aircraft operations and maintenance activities; audit training and knowledge, plus experience of a quality management system, as well as ‘lean skills’ developed during my time on the Tornado Lean Team and the QCIT.

While in uniform, Guy also gained a Higher National Certificate (HNC) in Electrical Engineering and the Institute of Electrical Engineers’ 16th Edition Wiring Regulations. Resettlement

My CTW [Career Transition Workshop] was very useful for targeting and honing my CV. I would advise future attendees to take a draft CV with them, with all the key dates and details already completed, as many people spent their time just constructing a basic CV and missed the full benefit of the consultants’ skills.

I also found it useful for identifying elements you enjoy or don’t enjoy in working life, and therefore for highlighting potential roles,” he added.

During his resettlement period, he also undertook a PRINCE2 course with Avanta Training, and has, he says, ‘used the knowledge ever since’, as well as fibre optic and cable training with CTTS [Cable Telecommunications Training Services] in Lincoln.

Finding a job

In terms of finding work on leaving the Forces, Guy says that ‘personal contact led to two interviews with companies in the structured cabling sector’, which led on to his first role as an engineer in large structured cabling and network installation projects with Farnborough-based company Data Techniques. Use of the professional networking site LinkedIn led to his current role as a lean expert at Airbus, based at Central Entity (Airbus HQ) in Toulouse, France.

Current employment

Guy’s current role involves ‘leading strategy for lean deployment across all Airbus functions’, as part of the Corporate Lean Management Department, under the Head of Quality and Lean for Airbus, specialising in engineering areas:

I work in a transnational environment, in an internal consultant-type role, both challenging the organisation and providing expert guidance on lean strategy, methods and tools, in the organisation’s quest to establish a lean culture and improve performance for customers, and optimise processes,” he says.

Typical tools might include valuestream mapping, visual management, 5S, total productive maintenance, and problem-solving tools and techniques. A typical day might call for me to run or facilitate workshops [in French or English], interface with or provide support to senior managers or project leaders, plan improvement projects or skills-transfer regarding lean tools or techniques to dedicated improver teams within business units.

No two days are the same. Although I can often work quite long hours, there is a high level of personal challenge, but with this comes recognition at the highest levels of the corporation. There can also be a significant amount of travel, to support [internal] customers in various locations.

There are good benefits with the Airbus Staff Council and other employee benefits. Living in France is excellent in terms of quality of life - house and fuel prices are significantly lower than they are the UK. Toulouse is probably the most cosmopolitan city in France, outside Paris.

Building on Service experience

During my last role in the RAF, in the Tornado Lean Team [subsequently the QCIT]. I learned and developed many of the skills and techniques I have refined and use today in my daily business. In addition, strong project management skills and experience are a must in my present role.

I enjoy the autonomy of my current work, the high management expectations and challenge, as well as the opportunities for advancement. I am no longer constrained by the ‘can’t do that because of rank’ mentality.

My frequent interactions with company executives give me the opportunity to be an integral part of the organisation’s transformation efforts, as well as to support the development of vision and strategies for the future.

I now have a more balanced home life, with guaranteed weekends off, and stable education, medical and dental support, and so on, for my children, as well as the possibility for my wife to develop her own career without the disruption of moves and detachments.

Best of all, concludes Guy, he is benefiting from a ‘significant increase’ in salary."
Where can you fly on the Airbus A380? - Executive Traveller,"Tue, 12 Apr 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vd2hlcmUtY2FuLXlvdS1mbHktb24tdGhlLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With more and more Airbus A380 superjumbos being delivered to the world's airlines, the A380 has become a firm passenger favourite. The seating is often upgraded from what's offered on Boeing 747 and 777 aircraft and you'll enjoy a significantly quieter ride.

Not only do Qantas, Singapore Airlines and Emirates all fly the A380 from Australia -- through to Singapore, London and Dubai, for starters -- business travellers are increasingly able to pick flights on one of the mammoth planes abroad.

Lufthansa, Air France and Emirates have been some of the most recent airlines to receive brand new planes, so here's an update where you can fly them overseas.

Note that we're seeing a clear trend of airlines using the planes on the very longest-haul flights possible -- about 12 hours from Europe to San Francisco, for example, and not much less than that from Europe to China.

Dubai to Shanghai, on Emirates

Apart from Qantas, Emirates is the airline whose A380s will be most familiar to Australian travellers, since they fly to Sydney and on to Auckland.

The airline is well on its way to receiving all 90 of its ordered A380s -- nearly half of the whole superjumbo order book at Airbus -- with 15 aircraft in service.

Emirates' latest A380 route is Dubai-Shanghai Pudong, three days a week. The airline also flies from Dubai to London, Sydney (and on to Auckland), Toronto, Seoul, Paris, Jeddah, Beijing, Manchester, Hong Kong (and on to Bangkok) and New York.

Frankfurt to Beijing, on Lufthansa

The German national airline is boosting its A380 flights to Beijing to a daily service as of this week. Previously, Monday, Thursday, Friday and Sunday flights had been flown using a Boeing 747.

Lufthansa has six A380s, which it flies to Beijing, Johannesburg and New York, and also used the aircraft on flights to Tokyo before the devastating Tohoku earthquake.

Frankfurt to Miami, on Lufthansa

Later in the northern hemisphere's summer season, Lufthansa will also replace its Boeing 747 flights to Miami with A380 superjumbos.

Paris to San Francisco, on Air France

The French carrier is upgrading its SFO flights to the A380 between June 6 and September 4. Air France will be the the second A380 operator at the airport -- which recently refurbished its Terminal 2, although Air France is still in Terminal 1.

Air France uses its four A380s on routes from Paris to New York and Johannesburg, with Montreal starting in April and Washington DC starting in June. The airline has withdrawn the A380 from flights to Tokyo until May."

Korean Air is outfitting its new Airbus A380s with a duty-free shop.

Heather Cho, from Korean Air's Catering & Inflight Sales Business Division, says the shop will promote ""new, existing and exclusive products"" from the airline's duty-free range, which will also be complemented by the continuation of the regular cart service.

“We will display the best-selling items across all categories such as liquor, cosmetics, accessories and fragrances,” Cho says. ""The whole design process was done five years ago and the planning took place before that. Finally it’s going to happen in reality, and that’s exciting.”

The stall has been designed and manufactured for Korean Air by aircraft interior firm AIM Aviation and will replace 13 seats on the A380.

However, AIM sales director Chris Whetter tells FlightGlobal that while losing 13 seats also means ""you're losing a lot of revenue, the Korean mentality is that they buy all the duty free on every flight.""

Each of the bottles on display is fitted with a heavy-duty magnet on the bottom to keep it in place during turbulence, although Whetter says that ""if there is severe turbulence the shop has to be emptied out."" The alcohol is also stowed on taxi, take-off and landing.

Advertising is also available in the shop, with cosmetics firm Lancome buying the first spot.

FlightGlobal reports that the store will be open for business for the duration of each flight and staffed by full-time sales assistants. First class passengers will get first crack at the store, followed by business class passengers and then those travelling in economy."
AirAsia celebrates Carabao’s 30th anniversary with newly painted Airbus - Pattaya Mail,"Wed, 20 Apr 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhdHRheWFtYWlsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9haXJhc2lhLWNlbGVicmF0ZXMtY2FyYWJhb3MtMzB0aC1hbm5pdmVyc2FyeS13aXRoLW5ld2x5LXBhaW50ZWQtYWlyYnVzLTI3OTPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thai AirAsia last week dedicated one of their fleet’s Airbuses in celebration of legendary rock band, Carabao’s 30 year anniversary.

Gathering at the Novotel Suvarnabhumi Airport Hotel, AirAsia officials announced that they have painted one of their brand new Airbus A320 passenger jets and dedicated it to Carabao.

The Airbus A320 will fly between AirAsia’s 10 domestic destinations to promote Carabao’s upcoming concerts nationwide.

As part of the celebration, passengers will also be able to win collector’s items and redeem a free concert ticket by presenting their AirAsia boarding passes at all 10 AirAsia airport counters nationwide.

(L to R) Preechaya Rasametanin, Thai AirAsia’s Director of Engineering; Carabao’s Thierry, Add and Lek and Tassapon Bijleveld, CEO of Thai AirAsia.

“AirAsia and Carabao have something very much in common, such as the ability to win the hearts of many people by simply being fun, friendly, and approachable. AirAsia is extremely proud to be part of this historic celebration for such a legendary band,” says Tassapon Bijleveld, CEO of Thai AirAsia.

The relationship between Carabao and Thai AirAsia began about 8 years ago when Thai AirAsia first started domestic flights in Thailand. Carabao’s logo was painted onto some of the fleet, which they hoped passengers would come to realize meant that ‘everyone can fly’. The message was boosted by the theme song written by the band’s guitarist and singer Thierry Mekwattana.

Tassapon Bijleveld, CEO of Thai AirAsia, talks about the promotion.

AirAsia has painted one of their brand new Airbus A320s to promote Carabao’s One Province One Concert (OPOC) initiative, where they will perform at all 76 provinces throughout Thailand. The tour started on April 1 and will run until December 15 this year.

Apart from offering the rock band’s fans a chance to travel on the new jet, AirAsia is also offering a special dish – chicken in brown sauce and pepper with rice, cooked according to Lek Carabao’s secret recipe. The dish has been offered since March and has quickly become a best seller onboard.

“AirAsia is confident that the band’s 30 year anniversary will be celebrated with great enthusiasm all year and we are delighted to be able to spread the joy for the millions of fans by offering flights to concert destinations along with activities throughout the country,” Tassapon added.

According to Preechaya Rasametanin, Thai AirAsia’s Director of Engineering, who supervised the entire painting project, “This plane truly represents the Carabao band as the artists themselves, Lek Carabao, Add Carabao and Thierry Mekwattana, whose faces are painted on the plane’s tail, were also involved in the creative decisions and elements that went into the plane’s design.

“The engineering team put great effort into making this a beautiful design for the fans and much attention was given to detail. It’s quite exciting that this plane will now be appearing in all of AirAsia’s destinations,” Preechaya said.

Towards the end of the press conference, Lek Carabao demonstrated his signature dish, sharing his mother-in-law’s recipe for chicken in brown sauce and pepper with rice for all the press to taste.

Shortly after, the entire entourage proceeded to the tarmac to see for the first time, the newly painted jet.

To celebrate the historic occasion, AirAsia’s 30 year Carabao promotion starts at THB 730 per person, one way, for domestic flights (including tax and fees). For more information, please visit www.AirAsia.com.

For flight and hotel package deals starting from THB 2,330 per person for a 3-day, 2-night stay, please visit www.AirAsiaGo.com

Carabao fans can also visit www.carabao30.com for the band’s tour and concert schedule.

Lek Carabao demonstrates his signature dish, which is now available on-board.

Add Carabao stands proudly in front of the new plane.

Air France 447 wreckage found: new clues on safety of Airbus A330 planes - Executive Traveller,"Tue, 05 Apr 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vYWlyLWZyYW5jZS00NDctd3JlY2thZ2UtZm91bmQtbmV3LWNsdWVzLW9uLXNhZmV0eS1vZi1haXJidXMtYTMzMC1wbGFuZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A large amount of wreckage from Air France 447 has been discovered, 4 km under water on the ocean floor between Brazil and Africa.

The discovery raises hopes that air crash investigators will be able to recover the missing black box recorders that could explain why the Airbus A330 -- a plane commonly flown in Australia -- dropped from the sky in June 2009.

The analysis of the wreckage is vitally important for airlines and their passengers worldwide, as the Airbus A330 is a commonly flown plane all over the world.

It is used within Australia -- mainly on longer East to West coast routes -- by Qantas and Virgin Blue, and to Singapore by Jetstar, as well as around the world by international airlines including Emirates, Etihad, Thai, Delta, Cathay Pacific, China Airlines and Korean Air, among others.

So far, the explanation that air speed sensors on the plane failed due to iced-up pitot tubes, is merely a theory based on a sequence of messages the plane automatically radioed back to base seconds before crashing, indicating that the pilots were being given conflicting air speed messages, and might not have known how fast the plane was flying.

Flying a plane too fast can cause the fuselage to break up mid-air, while flying it too slowly can cause the plane to lose aerodynamic lift and the engines to stall.

However, investigators hope the large field of wreckage found will enable it to gather hard facts on what caused the plane to crash, including why the plane may have flown into a damaging storm cell without giving normal warnings to the pilots.

Large sections of the plane's fuselage have been found intact, with identifiable bodies of passengers still strapped into their seats, preserved by the freezing temperatures at the bottom of the ocean.

One important discovery already, even before the wreckage is lifted from the ocean floor, is that oxygen masks had not deployed in the cabin. This indicates that the plane had not lost pressurization before it hit the water, confirming the theory that it broke up on impact, rather than rupturing mid-air.

Following the crash, the pitot tubes that provide the data for air speed sensors were replaced on all A330s worldwide, with a different design that is less susceptible to clogging with ice.

However, other problems have continued to dog the aircraft. In late March, a Qantas A330 was forced to make an emergency landing in Cairns after a fire broke out in the cockpit, with flames appearing twice, the second time after pilots thought they had successfully extinguished the fire. The plane was en route from Manila to Sydney.

In 2008, another Qantas A330-303 had to make an emergency landing at a the Learmonth, WA Air Force base after the plane made sudden, unexpected dives, seriously injuring 12 passengers and injuring 103 more."

It came on the eve of the airline’s opening of a new service to Las Vegas, and the creation of 100 jobs in the Manchester area as a result of the expansion of services.

The new Airbus A330, taking off from Manchester Airport and named Beauty Queen, is part of a fleet of 10 new planes worth $2.2 billion to be delivered over the next two years.

Julie Southern, chief commercial officer for Virgin Atlantic, said: “We are very proud to welcome Beauty Queen to our fleet today.

“After some challenging times for the airline industry it is great news to be expanding again and adding new aircraft to wow our customers.

“Not only does the A330 deliver savings in emissions and fuel consumption, it offers our customers a cutting-edge product which will transform their flying experience.

“We are looking forward to seeing how customers like the new touch-screen in-flight entertainment system where they can enjoy the latest movies and music as well as downloading their own choice of content including holiday snaps and travel tips.”"
"Qantas to add third Airbus A380 flight to Los Angeles' LAX airport, replacing Boeing 747 -- from Brisbane? - Executive Traveller","Tue, 26 Apr 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vcWFudGFzLXRvLWFkZC10aGlyZC1hMzgwLWZsaWdodC10by1sYS1mcm9tLWJyaXNiYW5l0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qantas is set to add a third A380 flight from Australia to Los Angeles' LAX airport, according to newspaper reports in LA, adding yet more seats across the Pacific. Business travellers are likely to see cheaper fares and more availability on the route as a result.

More competition between airlines is good news for passengers, but only if the smaller players aren't forced out of the market. When that happens, larger airlines can put their prices up again, as Australians found after Ansett Australia collapsed in 2002.

Qantas' A380 plans are a warning shot across the bow for Strategic Airways -- which plans to be the third Australian airline to fly to the US -- and for John Borghetti, CEO of the Virgin Blue/V Australia/Virgin Australia group. Virgin Blue is applying to the US Department of Transportation to be allowed to hook up with American carrier Delta.

Qantas previously announced plans to out-compete Virgin Blue's new A330 planes with business class seats on the Sydney-Perth route with its own Red Roo Boeing 747 aircraft, fitted with international business class standard Skybeds at the pointy end.

The information about Qantas' A380 comes buried in an article in Los Angeles local paper the Daily Breeze on the revamp of LAX's international terminal.

The article, which focusses more on the impact for LAX itself, says: ""Singapore Airlines and Korean Air each plan to launch one A380 flight from LAX later this year, while Qantas intends to add a third A380 jetliner to its Los Angeles routes in 2012.""

Will Horton of industry insider site FlightGlobal also spotted the article in a sister newspaper, and speculates that Qantas may add the A380 to routes from Brisbane as it replaces the majority of its 747 fleet with A380s.

Other candidates for new A380s would be Frankfurt via Singapore, Buenos Aires and Tokyo -- or further flights on the Kangaroo Route to London via Hong Kong, Bangkok and Singapore.

Qantas' flights to Dallas-Fort Worth aren't likely to see A380s any time soon, since the six 747-400ER planes (ER for ""extended range"") are the newest 747s in Qantas' fleet, delivered between 2002 and 2003. The older Qantas 747s, delivered thirteen or fourteen years earlier in 1989, will be first for the auction lot or scrapyard."
Chile takes delivery of first anti-submarine warfare Airbus C295 - defenceWeb,"Mon, 04 Apr 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuY2V3ZWIuY28uemEvYWVyb3NwYWNlL2Flcm9zcGFjZS1hZXJvc3BhY2UvY2hpbGUtdGFrZXMtZGVsaXZlcnktb2YtZmlyc3QtYW50aS1zdWJtYXJpbmUtd2FyZmFyZS1haXJidXMtYzI5NS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Chilean Navy has taken delivery of the first Airbus Military C295 in its anti-submarine warfare (ASW) configuration. The handover took place after the aircraft was certified by INTA, the Spanish authority responsible for certification and military airworthiness.

Based on the Maritime Patrol (MPA) configuration of the aircraft, the C295 ASW is the first ASW type designed and certified in Europe, to enter service since the 1960s-vintage Breguet Atlantic. It is a modern and risk-free choice to replace the veteran and ageing P-3 Orion or Atlantic fleets. The new model is the latest variant of the successful C295 family of multirole aircraft. Launched in 1996, it has been proved in many military roles and civic missions for the benefit of society. Transport logistics, medical evacuation or surveillance are just some of the roles already deployed by this aircraft in its MPA version.

The aircraft is equipped with two underwing hard points to carry weapons or other stores and boasts a comprehensive suite of sensors including a search radar, digital avionics that are compatible with night-vision goggles (NVG), automatic identification system, acoustic system, and a magnetic anomaly detector. The data from all these sensors are processed by the Fully Integrated Tactical System (FITS). This Airbus Military-developed mission system presents the data in an intuitive form to the four tactical operators via on board mission consoles as well as to the pilots.

This C295 ASW is part of a three aircraft order placed by the Chilean Navy in October 2007. The first one, a C295 MPA, was delivered in December 2009. The other two are both ASW versions and the second is being delivered over the next few months.

The Chilean Army, Navy, and Air Force already operate one C295 MPA, three CN235s, and 13 C212s. To date, Airbus Military has sold 356 CN235 and C295 aircraft to 55 different operators.

The type conducted its first torpedo launch in May last year. The C295 MPA/ASW features two under-wing pylons for the installation of torpedoes and other external loads. It also incorporates a Store Management System (SMS), integrated with the Airbus Military Fully Integrated Tactical System (FITS), to control the deployment of sonobuoys for submarine detection and torpedoes.

The C295 MPA has a flight endurance of over 11 hours, and it is used for a wide variety of missions: Search and Rescue (SAR), control of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), law enforcement, marine pollution detection, as well as defence missions.

Airbus Military adds the C295 platform, a multi-mission short/medium range tactical transport aircraft, offers high manoeuvrability and excellent qualities for low-altitude flying. In addition, it has been widely tested in all kinds of aerial deployments: launch of chains of SAR rafts, emergency equipment and parachutists."

Qantas' tenth Airbus A380 joins the fleet on Sydney-London flights - Executive Traveller,"Tue, 12 Apr 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vcWFudGFzLXRlbnRoLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLWpvaW5zLXRoZS1mbGVldC1vbi1zeWRuZXktbG9uZG9uLWZsaWdodHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qantas has added the tenth Airbus A380 to its fleet, with the new aircraft taking on the Sydney-Singapore-London service of QF31/QF32.

That's a particularly appropriate route, given that the A380 is named after Australian aviation pioneer Bert Hinkler – who made the first solo flight from Britain to Australia in 1928. That journey took just under 16 days in a single-engine aircraft, compared to 21 hours on his namesake superjumbo.

The arrival of the Bert Hinkler brings Qantas to the halfway mark in its A380 order, with the next ten to be delivered through to 2015. All of these will be fitted with an upgraded and improved version of the same model Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines which were the cause of the 'QF32 incident' in November 2010.

But Qantas says that the continued arrival of factory-fresh A380s won't mean an all-out retirement for its Boeing 747s.

""We have always planned to retain a 747-400 fleet, including the six 747-400ERs that have been delivered since 2002"" a Qantas spokeswoman told Australian Business Traveller.

""A long term fleet plan needs to remain flexible and able to adapt to changing conditions and the type of shocks the industry has experienced – from 9/11 and the SARS crisis to the GFC.""

Three 747-400s will have been put out to pasture by the time the next two A380s arrive this year, in addition to the four 747-400s which have already been decommissioned.

However, nine 747s will remain in the fleet – the three most recent 747-400s and all six 747-400ER – which will be reconfigured by the removal of first class into a standard three-class aircraft with business, premium economy and economy seats. This will include the A380-grade fully flat Skybeds in business class."

This week: Pearl Business Class on Etihad's Airbus A340-600.

The plane

Virgin Blue (soon to be Virgin Australia) partner Etihad uses the A340-600 on most flights between its Abu Dhabi hub and Australian destinations Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.

Australian passengers will find useful connections from Abu Dhabi to European, Middle Eastern and African destinations.

Pearl Business Class sits in two cabins behind three rows of Diamond First Class and ahead of Coral Economy Class.

The Pearl Business Class cabin

Split over two mini-cabins, there are 26 seats in business class. Rows 5-8 sit ahead of a block of galley kitchens and lavatories, and rows 9-12 are found just in front of Economy.

The Business Class cabin is laid out in a staggered layout similar to Emirates' A380s, where every seat has direct access to the aisle. Here's how it works.

A and K seats are in even-numbered rows next to the windows on each side of the plane, with B and J seats on the aisle in odd-numbered rows. To get to A & K, you squeeze through a small gap between the rows.

Middle seats E and F are in the centre in even-numbered rows, with a privacy screen separating them. D and G seats are centre aisles in odd-numbered rows.

Each seat converts into a fully flat bed -- not a lie-flat tilted seat on an angle.

There's a large fold-out table for meals and working as well, and every seat has an AC power point, plus two USB connectors for charging mobile devices like iPhones, iPads and BlackBerrys.

The best seats on the plane

Since the seats are staggered in the cabin, they can be split into three categories:

A & K seats : by the window, these have the most privacy.

: by the window, these have the most privacy. B, D, G & J seats : no need to squeeze out into the aisle, but lack privacy.

: no need to squeeze out into the aisle, but lack privacy. E & F seats: if you're travelling in a pair, these very centre seats have extra privacy from others and let you talk to each other easily.

Once you've chosen which sort of seat you want, pick your row:

Row 8: With only window seats A and K in this row, these are the quietest and most private seats in Business Class.

Row 5-7: these are further forward, so likely to have less noise from economy class, engines and lavatories.

The worst seats on the plane

Row 12: right in front of economy -- and bassinet positions -- this will be the noisiest row in business class. Seats 12A and 12K are above the wing, so won't have a good view either.

Row 9-11: these are closer to economy and the engines, so will be noisier than the forward cabin.
