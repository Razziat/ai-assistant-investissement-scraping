Airbus launches Skywise – aviation's open data platform - Airbus,"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0wNi1haXJidXMtbGF1bmNoZXMtc2t5d2lzZS1hdmlhdGlvbnMtb3Blbi1kYXRhLXBsYXRmb3Jt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,". Combining Airbus’ aerospace expertise with Palantir’s advanced data analytics solutions;

· To become the platform of reference used by the aviation industry;

· Enabling Airbus to harness deep in-service data and insights to improve its aircraft designs and support offerings;

· Already providing results with several ‘early adopter’ airlines.·

Airbus has launched a new aviation data platform in collaboration with Palantir Technologies – pioneers in big-data integration and advanced analytics. Skywise aims to become the single platform of reference used by all major aviation players to improve their operational performance and business results and to support their own digital transformation. Skywise is already improving industrial operations performance throughout Airbus’ industrial footprint and allows now to deliver enhanced aircraft and equipment designs, better service and support offerings based on deeper in-service data insights.

Skywise will provide all users with one single access point to their enriched data by bringing together to aviation data from multiple sources across the industry into one secure cloud-based platform. These airline sources include: work orders; spares consumption; components data; aircraft / fleet configuration; on-board sensor data; and flight schedules. Additional data sources which are traditionally shared with Airbus and hosted only on isolated servers will also be integrated into the platform to help operators conduct their own analyses and make decisions based on the full scope of their available data. These shared sources include: operational interruption history; parts replacements; post-flight reports; pilot reports; aircraft condition monitoring reports; complete on-board aircraft data; technical documentation; technical requests; and service bulletins (SBs).

Examples of how Skywise could help airlines to support and shape their business models include:

Improved fleet operational reliability through predictive & preventative maintenance;

Improved operational efficiency for legacy fleets;

Rapid root-cause analyses of in-service issues;

Optimising each aircraft’s performance through flight operations data analytics;

Tracking maintenance effectiveness over time;

One-click reporting workflows, including complex reporting to regulatory bodies.

By combining Airbus’ intimate aerospace expertise with Palantir’s know-how in deploying data platforms, Skywise will empower end users to gain new insights from their own data. Furthermore, the platform will allow airlines and other aviation stakeholders to enhance their operations through access to OEM expertise and global fleet context. The unique combination of global data and aerospace experience deliver business value in the following key areas: reducing flight disruptions; decreasing maintenance cost through predictive maintenance; optimising flight operations; transforming cabin and ground operations; making faster decisions to cope with unexpected events; and optimising fleet management by interpreting high volumes of fleet and flight operations data – even if it resides on legacy information systems.

With Skywise, operators of Airbus aircraft will be in a position to leverage the cumulative knowledge of the 20,000 Airbus engineers who have tracked the performance of each individual aircraft over its entire operational life. Until now, this deep reservoir of expertise was accessible only during the years of development and flight tests through the aircraft Entry-into-Service.

Moreover, by integrating their operational, maintenance, and aircraft data into a secure and open platform, airlines will be able to store, access, manage, and analyse selected Airbus data together with their own data and global benchmark data without the need for additional infrastructure investments. This resulting value will soon give Airbus’ customers new insights at aircraft, fleet, company, and global level.

Marc Fontaine, the Airbus Digital Transformation Officer, commented: “Together with Palantir, we are already realising major business value from data previously hidden within our own operations. Now with Skywise we are taking this relationship to the next level by offering its advantages to the aviation industry. We’ve seen its power in our own operations, and Airbus is convinced of its huge potential to bring value to our customers and industry partners, as the new ‘beating heart of aviation’.”

Dr Alex Karp, CEO of Palantir Technologies, said: “Our relationship began with a focus on Airbus-internal operations – manufacturing, engineering, services – and we’re expanding now to bring this same analytical acumen directly to airlines. The potential for collaboration between the world's top engineering firm, Airbus, its airline customers, and Palantir's software is unprecedented.”

The deliverables will be tailored for each user and will include scalable services (such as analytics, apps and APIs) which can be used by Airbus, customers, and suppliers – ensuring complete data continuity with benefits across the entire value chain.

The technology powering the data platform is designed to interoperate seamlessly with customers’ existing IT infrastructures and deliver capabilities beyond what is possible with standard ‘open source’ software. At its core, Skywise helps better manage complex data environments with many interdependencies so that users can unlock data in service of business outcomes.

Today, several major airlines around the world are already Skywise early adopters. Examples of the projects undertaken with these airlines include: events tracking and resolution; turnaround-time analysis; operations analytics; predictive maintenance; reliability analysis and benchmarking; maintenance decision support. Moreover, in the near future, the benefits of Skywise will also become available for Airbus helicopters, military aircraft, and other products operators.

The initial offer will cover the core digital aviation platform, a new aircraft connectivity solution, and selected platform applications and integrated dashboards (including tools for predictive maintenance and fleet reliability deployed with Skywise’s early adopter airlines).

Airbus is a global leader in aeronautics, space and related services. In 2016, it generated revenues of €67 billion and employed a workforce of around 134,000. Airbus offers the most comprehensive range of passenger airliners from 100 to more than 600 seats. Airbus is also a European leader providing tanker, combat, transport and mission aircraft, as well as Europe’s number one space enterprise and the world’s second largest space business. In helicopters, Airbus provides the most efficient civil and military rotorcraft solutions worldwide.."

But, like many companies today, it is delving into digital. In this interview with McKinsey’s Rik Kirkland, Dirk Hoke, the CEO of Airbus Defence and Space, talks about how expanding into data-driven services complements Airbus’s existing hardware-platform services and what the growth opportunities are from fast-developing emerging technologies. An edited version of his remarks follows.

Interview transcript

A few months ago we started a company-wide digital-transformation program at Airbus, which we call Quantum. It looks at digital transformation on all levels. Within that, I’m responsible for digital transformation for the new business models—exactly, for creating new data-driven models for the whole group.

There are two sides. One is the digital transformation inside the backbone of our company. The second is going into the traditional business to try to see where digitization can improve either the processes or the business model or where it can create completely new business models.

We announced last year that we will step into the commercial-drone space. We will not only continue to develop military drones but we will also enter the commercial-drone space. From the beginning, we looked not only at the hardware platform but also the software platform—and the related new business model that comes along with that: looking at specific verticals and developing a data-driven service that we can provide to specific customers within these verticals.

This was probably the biggest cultural change when I came in. Because when I started to talk about platforms, my team thought that I was talking about hardware platforms. Because in our language, a platform is an aircraft.

In fact, what I was talking about was developing new data-driven digital services, and I was talking about software platforms. So it took us a while to converge on the language, but we made it. It is no surprise that inside Airbus we come from a hardware-oriented background. However, as are all the companies in the world, we are slowly changing into a software company. So there will be much bigger revenue shares coming from software services in the future.

When we looked at our growth strategy for the next five to ten years, we clearly said, “We want to create smarter products, we want to develop our standard services, and we want to develop new digital services.”

Asking new questions

What is important for our people to understand is, we are starting with a different question. In the past, we developed hardware. Then we developed a better, more modern, higher-performing version of it. And only then we started looking for customers.

In the future, we will start by asking the question, “What problem do we solve?,” looking for a software perspective, going into the hardware perspective, and adapting other products in the way that our customers need. There will be a shift in thinking toward our R&D. But it also creates a new, more agile thinking inside our teams. We are trying new things.

People get worried about digitization because there are a lot of people that don’t understand what this means for them. It took me a while to explain that our new strategy is not about creating new services—or new data-driven services—and giving up our traditional hardware platforms. These hardware platforms are generating the data that are uniquely used for all the data-driven services. Data-driven services are complementary businesses, and they are creating new jobs.

The seven decisions that matter in a digital transformation: A CEO’s guide to reinvention

It doesn’t eliminate existing jobs. It took a while to convince our people that this transformation is something good for the future, because it enables us to create new revenue streams, which will empower us to put more money in R&D and develop even smarter products in the future.

Competing on data

Together with DigitalGlobe, we provide most of the satellite pictures of the world. We also have a lot of historical data, which is stored, and partially used once we know the location and time.

We’re looking at the fast-developing machine-learning and AI [artificial-intelligence] technologies. We’re also looking at the development plans of many companies going into cognitive analytics, which combined with quantum computing, will enable us to do analytics that we have not been able to do in the past.

We have a data-driven service already up and running: it’s an application called Farmstar, for agriculture, where we serve farmers with data regarding fertilizer and watering of their fields. We give them exact overviews on how to improve the crop and the harvest in their area.

This is a stand-alone service. There are still farmers that are not connected to the Internet. They still get paper versions of our analytics, and it works fine. But most customers are digital, connect to the platform, download the information, and use it for harvesting their fields.

The good thing is that we’re not only providing the products that can generate the data but we’re also providing the ones that can handle the transfer of the data. For example, we have our own business for secure communication, for encryption. We have developed and put into service—recently in November—what we call the space data highway: a technology based on laser, in order to transfer data to satellite at a much higher speed than the traditional technologies, which not only enables satellite-to-satellite communication but also earth-to-ground communication.

Think of Africa, where you see the leapfrog to telecommunication, and a lot of the business today is handled through smartphones. But coverage is a topic, especially Internet services and data services.

Insulation and putting towers everywhere is an expensive investment. But imagine hundreds of thousands of our HAPS [High Altitude Pseudo-Satellite] systems over Africa, over a specific country, deploying these kinds of services at a high quality."

Airbus says future aircraft might support multiple IFC satellite antennas at once - SpaceNews,"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXJidXMtc2F5cy1mdXR1cmUtYWlyY3JhZnQtbWlnaHQtc3VwcG9ydC1tdWx0aXBsZS1pZmMtc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWFudGVubmFzLWF0LW9uY2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Aircraft manufacturer Airbus is considering ways to add multiple antennas to planes in order to let different satellite inflight connectivity providers serve the same aircraft simultaneously.

Mark Rich, vice president of Airbus’ connected fleet division, told SpaceNews June 9 at the Global Connected Aircraft Summit that one of the company’s big concerns with inflight connectivity is the reliability of the service, and one way Airbus might boost reliability on future aircraft is by enabling several antenna systems at once.

“From a reliability perspective, it may actually make sense to have multiple antennas on an aircraft so we can have multiple simultaneous connections with multiple different satellites with different services, and move the management of connectivity into the aircraft,” he said.

Airbus works with providers of inflight connectivity to bolt antenna systems onto planes, a process that can take an aircraft out of service for several days, costing airlines revenue. Suppliers of those systems — such as Gogo, Global Eagle, Panasonic, ViaSat and others — are striving to reduce the amount of time needed to complete those installations.

Rich said Airbus is interested in changing aircraft architectures to “have more of a common data signal processing capability that can connect to any satellite system.”

“Airline choice is a fundamental change in the architecture, so we are looking at how can we encourage or implement that,” he said.

Rich said Airbus is well aware that sporting multiple antennas and protective radomes on a single aircraft would add considerable weight and drag, requiring more fuel and making flight operations more expensive.

“That’s where we need new antenna technology,” he said, highlighting Kymeta, Phasor and Satixfy, three rising flat-panel antenna companies with lighter antennas that can conform more smoothly to an aircraft’s surface.

Rich acknowledged that there are still lots of challenges to having aircraft with more than one antenna system. His job, he said, is to look out five to 10 years forward at where connectivity will be, and try to make that vision a reality for Airbus.

“If you take a narrowbody aircraft, the impact of adding today’s satellite antenna system to that is like adding a free-loading passenger on every single flight of that aircraft, because of just the weight and the drag,” he said. “You are carrying around an additional passenger and paying for the fuel every time. We have to get past that, we have to reduce these things down to much less weight, drag and dollar impact, and then we can afford to put on more than one antenna to deal with this redundancy of systems.”"
Airbus presents the A380plus - Airbus,"Sun, 18 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0wNi1haXJidXMtcHJlc2VudHMtdGhlLWEzODBwbHVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"· Further increasing A380 efficiency and economics

· Maintaining A380 unique comfort level

· New large winglets to provide up to 4 % fuel burn savings

· 13% cost reduction per seat versus current A380

Airbus is presenting a development study for an enhanced A380, the “A380plus”. The study includes aerodynamic improvements in particular new, large winglets and other wing refinements that allow for up to 4% fuel burn savings. Added to an optimised A380 maintenance programme and the enhanced cabin features first shown at Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX) in April, the overall benefit is a 13% cost per seat reduction versus today’s A380.

John Leahy, Airbus COO Customers, explains: “The A380plus is an efficient way to offer even better economics and improved operational performance at the same time.” John adds: “It is a new step for our iconic aircraft to best serve worldwide fast-growing traffic and the evolving needs of the A380 customers. The A380 is well-proven as the solution to increasing congestion at large airports, and in offering a unique, passenger-preferred experience. ”

The new winglets measure approximately 4,7 metres in height (an uplet of 3.5m, and a downlet of 1,2m). It is designed to improve aerodynamics and reduce drag.

The optimised cabin layout based on the ‘cabin enablers’ presented at Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX), allows up to 80 additional seats* with no compromise on comfort: redesigned stairs, a combined crew-rest compartment, sidewall stowage removal, a new 9-abreast seat configuration in premium economy and 11-abreast in economy.

The A380plus will have an increased maximum take-off weight (MTOW) of 578 tonnes providing the flexibility of carrying up to 80 more passengers over today’s range (8,200nm), or flying 300nm further.

The A380plus features longer maintenance check intervals, a reduced six-year check downtime, and systems improvements, which will reduce maintenance costs and increase aircraft availability.

The A380 is the world’s largest, most spacious airliner that offers passengers the smoothest, quietest and most comfortable ride. With two full widebody decks, offering widest seats, wide aisles and more floor space, the A380 has the unique capability to generate revenue, stimulate traffic and attract the flying public, who can now specifically select the A380 when booking a flight via the iflyA380.com web site. Over 170 million passengers have already enjoyed the experience of flying on board an A380 today. Every two minutes, an A380 takes off or lands somewhere in the world.

*Note for Editors:

497 passengers is the airline’s average capacity of the A380s currently in operation today – which are consistently attracting above-average passenger load factors. With all A380 cabin enablers, the A380 average seat count would move from 497 to 575 in four classes, and generate significantly more revenue for airlines.

Cabin enablers description

New Forward Stairs – 20 more passengers (Business, Premium Economy & Economy Classes)

The NFS involves relocation of the forward stair from Door 1 to Door 2, and combining the entrance of the NFS to the upper deck (going up), with the adjacent staircase to the lower-deck crew-rest (going down). The NFS would make room for up to 20 additional passengers.

Combined Crew-Rest Compartment (CCRC) – three more passengers (Premium Economy)

For the CCRC, the existing flight-crew-rest (behind the cockpit in the mezzanine area at Door 1) is moved down and combined with the cabin crew rest on the lower deck. This innovation frees space for three extra Premium-Economy passengers at the front of the main-deck.

11-abreast 3-5-3 economy layout on the main-deck – 23 more passengers (Economy Class)

Thanks to an innovative seating concept developed by Airbus and its seating partners, Airbus is able to maintain an 18inch seat-width while offering airlines an 11-abreast Economy Class on the main-deck in a ‘3-5-3’ configuration. This enables an increase in capacity of 23 seats – adding significantly to the A380’s revenue-generating potential.

New Aft-Galley Stair Module (AGSM) – 14 more passengers + two food trolleys

The AGSM involves the redesign of the rear-stair from a spiral configuration to a straight/square one. On the main-deck, this allows valuable storage volume for galley modules. Overall the AGSM provides space for 14 more revenue passengers plus two extra food trolleys.

Upper-deck sidewall stowage removal – 10 more passengers (Business Class)

The option to remove the sidewall stowages on the upper-deck increases the wall-to-wall cabin width at foot-rest height – which makes space for up to 10 more business class seats / beds when an angled herring-bone arrangement is used.

Nine-abreast Premium Economy on the main deck – 11 more passengers (Premium Economy)

The A380’s generous main-deck cross section – significantly wider than any other commercial airliner – is allowing seat manufacturers to optimise their Premium Economy (PE) seat designs to create the industry’s most efficient and comfortable PE layout possible. This layout enables 11 more PE seats than in an eight-abreast layout."

The launch of Eutelsat 172B signals the rise of the electric age for satellite operations. Airbus is at the forefront of this new journey towards more competitive telecommunications satellite systems.

“With this spacecraft we are clearly setting a new benchmark,” Nicolas Chamussy, Head of Space Systems at Airbus, proclaimed as Eutelsat 172B soared into space.

The satellite, built by Airbus and launched on 2 June 2017, represents an industry first. It is the first high-power all-electric telecommunications satellite in the world.

Leading the race

Airbus has more than 12 years’ experience in using electric propulsion for satellite on-station manoeuvres and is now leading the race for high-power all-electric satellites: These employ electric propulsion for an even wider range of operations, while cutting fuel consumption and thereby reducing launch mass by 40%.

“We currently have 10 satellites using electric propulsion for station-keeping in orbit, and 6 all-electric satellites already ordered, making us the world leader in this domain,” says engineer Gérard Berger, marketing manager for Airbus telecommunications satellites.

“Furthermore we are the first in the world to adopt electric propulsion for raising the orbit [Electric Orbit Raising, EOR] for large and powerful satellites. The few all-electric satellites already in orbit have modest capacity compared with the satellites we usually build,” explains Berger.

50% of telecommunications satellites might use electric propulsion in the short run



Simpler, lighter and safer

Eutelsat 172B is the first high-power satellite in the 3-tonne class. SES-12, also based on Airbus’ ultra-reliable Eurostar platform in its E3000e variant, will be launched at the end of 2017. SES-14, currently under construction, will be the first high-power all-electric satellite in the 4-tonne class.

Electric satellites are simpler, lighter and safer. Without the need for heavy chemical propellant, the satellite can have a lower mass and therefore lower launch price, as such costs are in direct relation with mass. Operations are also safer at the launch site, because fuelling the satellite is unnecessary, and the mass savings can also be traded for a larger payload, thereby increasing mission capacity.

However, electric propulsion systems provide less thrust than their chemical counterparts and it takes three to six months to reach geostationary orbit, as opposed to one week using chemical propulsion. “For Eutelsat 172B it will be four months, less time than has been needed so far, because we are using a relatively higher thrust technology known as Hall Effect Thrusters,” Berger adds.

With full electric propulsion, tonnes of chemical propellant are replaced by a system that requires less than a fifth of the mass, in the form of xenon gas. This gas is ionised and accelerated in an electric field, and it can be ejected at very high speed using only electric power supplied by solar cells. This creates the thrust that moves the spacecraft.

6 all-electric satellites already ordered

12 years’ experience in using electric propulsion for satellite on-station manoeuvres

New journeys into space

“We have changed the paradigm of electric propulsion systems, which were originally meant for small satellites. Using the scale effect, we are offering more payload on one satellite, equivalent to two missions. We have all the energy needed to reach orbit thanks to the satellites’ large solar arrays,” explains Berger.

Electric propulsion systems are key to enable new missions, expanding the limits of reachable space. Subsequently, this technology will boost growth in areas such as telecommunications, space exploration, human flight, science or Earth observation, according to the European Space Agency (ESA).

Electric propulsion is set for Europe’s first mission to Mercury; BepiColombo, a multi-spacecraft mission to explore the planet in unprecedented detail, is to be launched in late 2018. Airbus is responsible for designing and building the European Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) and the Mercury Transfer Module.

LISA Pathfinder is also making use of electric propulsion orbiting the L1 point, some 1.5 million kilometres from Earth, on its mission to explore the existence of gravitational waves.

“We have changed the paradigm of electric propulsion systems,” Gérard Berger

Eutelsat 172B

On a mission

Industry forecasts suggest that in the short run at least 50% of telecommunications satellites might use electric propulsion. ESA’s NEOSAT programme – which targets developing and validating in orbit next-generation platforms – aims to help European satellite builders capture at least half of the world’s satcom market in 2018–30, generating €25 billion in sales.

Another goal is to reduce, by the end of the decade, the cost of a satellite in orbit by 30% compared with today’s spacecraft. Airbus, as the first manufacturer in the world to offer full electric propulsion for high-power and high-capacity missions, is at the forefront in achieving this goal.

Airbus launches new fixed and deployable flight recorders. - Airbus,"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0wNi1haXJidXMtbGF1bmNoZXMtbmV3LWZpeGVkLWFuZC1kZXBsb3lhYmxlLWZsaWdodC1yZWNvcmRlcnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"· Deployable voice and data recovery devices could eventually be offered for the entire range of Airbus commercial aircraft;

· Offering greatly improved location and redundancy for data recovery.

Airbus is to implement new fixed and deployable flight recorders for Airbus’ airliner programmes, in collaboration with L3 Technologies. The new devices will come in two versions: a fixed crash-protected Cockpit Voice and Data Recorder (CVDR), capable of recording up to 25 hours of voice and flight data on a single recorder; and an Automatic Deployable Flight Recorder (ADFR).

This new CVDR will be lighter, more compact, and will provide new capabilities compared with current generation of recorders, including versatile interfaces. The new CVDR answers the EASA and ICAO requirement to extend the duration of voice recording to 25 hours (today the current requirement calls for a duration of two hours of voice recording). Two of these new CVDRs would be fitted on the shorter-range A320 airliners. This will greatly increase the redundancy for both voice and flight data recovery, compared with today’s airliner installations – which comprise just one flight data recorder plus one separate voice recorder.

The other version of the new recording system – the ADFR – is aimed at longer range aircraft, with extended flight time over water or remote areas, such as the Airbus A321LR, A330, A350 XWB and A380. The ADFR will add a new capability to commercial airliners: the ability to be deployed automatically in case of significant structural deformation or water submersion. Designed to float, the crash-protected memory module containing up to 25 hours of recorded cockpit voice and flight data will be equipped with an integrated Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) to help rescue teams to rapidly locate and recover flight recorders.

Charles Champion, Executive Vice President of Engineering at Airbus Commercial Aircraft said: “Airbus, together with L3 Technologies and Leonardo DRS, is very pleased to be leading the commercial aircraft industry in implementing into our aircraft new deployable flight data and 25-hour voice recording capability.” He added: “Starting with the very long-range A350 XWB, we look forward to progressively installing these new voice and data recovery devices across our entire product range.”

“L3 is extremely proud to be the partner of choice for Airbus for this new technology innovation enabling rapid recovery of flight recorders and contributing to increased safety in air travel,” said Kris Ganase, President of L3 Aviation Products Sector. “This combined fixed and deployable system is an example of the technology that has made L3 one of the leading providers of flight recorders to airlines and OEMs for several decades.”

“DRS Leonardo is pleased to supply its ADFR technology to L3 and Airbus,” said Martin Munro, Vice President and General Manager for its Canadian manufacturing facility, “The incorporation of a deployable recording system supports recent ICAO requirements to aid in the identification and location of a downed-aircraft while enabling the rapid recovery of flight recorder data.”

The deployable ADFR will be installed in the rear of the fuselage, while a fixed CVDR will be installed near the front of the aircraft – thus greatly increasing the redundancy for both voice and flight data recovery, compared with today’s systems. The ADFR unit together with its mechanical ejection system will be designed and manufactured by DRS Technologies Canada Ltd. (a Leonardo DRS Company) and integrated by L3 in partnership with Airbus cross-programme Engineering.

The new recording systems will be available in 2019 initially on the A350 XWB, with subsequent deployment on all other Airbus aircraft types.

Last update: 2 July 2017

Perlan Mission II is a purpose-built glider aiming to soar on wind currents to 27.4 kilometres –the stratosphere – as it researches high-altitude flight, climate change and even aviation science related to travel on Mars. As partner of Perlan Project, Airbus is helping push the boundaries of aerospace and discover more about climate change.

Reaching new heights

The Perlan 2 glider plane is essentially a spacecraft with an 84-foot wingspan, engineered to fly in conditions that mirror the surface of Mars. But before it can reach its record-breaking goal of soaring to 90,000 ft (27.4 km), the Perlan Project team has first made few test runs much closer to Earth. These trials began on 23 September 2015 at the Redmond Airport in Redmond, Oregon, when the glider succesfully completed its first ever test flight.



In July 2017, Airbus Perlan Mission II launched its second season of flight testing in El Calafate, Argentina. This Patagonian region is one of a few places on earth where a combination of mountain winds and the polar vortex create the world’s highest “stratospheric mountain waves” – rising air currents that Perlan pilots believe can eventually carry their experimental aircraft to the edge of space.

As partner of the Perlan Project, Airbus is lending its technical expertise, as well as financial support.

Learning valuable lessons

At 90,000 feet, the Perlan 2 must be engineered to fly in less than 3% of normal air density and at temperatures of -70°C. The mission will harvest invaluable data for scientists worldwide to help update and improve existing climate models.

The Perlan glider plane will investigate the interaction between the troposphere, the lowest layer of the Earth’s atmosphere, and the layer above it, the stratosphere, as well as collecting data on the depletion of the ozone layer, which filters out harmful UV rays. The Airbus Perlan Mission II will also gain experience in very high altitude flight, an area of interest for Airbus for future aerospace applications.

Perlan 2 can explore the edge of space without polluting its path, helping us learn more about weather forecasting, climate change, the ozone layer, the future of aviation and the future of space travel.

Focus on efficiency and cabin comfort enhancements for Airbus A380 and A320 Family - Airbus,"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE3LTA2LWZvY3VzLW9uLWVmZmljaWVuY3ktYW5kLWNhYmluLWNvbWZvcnQtZW5oYW5jZW1lbnRzLWZvci1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1hbmQtYTMyMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Day 1 Highlights : The show has begun!

A developmental study for an enhanced A380 with even better economics and improved operational performance was unveiled at the start ofthis week’s Paris Air Show, where Airbus also announced the extension of its “Airspace” cabin brand to the A320 Family.

These steps underscored Airbus’ commitment to the continuous evolution of its product line with improvements for both airline operators and the passengers they fly.

The A380plus developmental study involves five enhancement elements: aerodynamic improvements for a reduction in fuel burn; an increase in the number of available seats in the upper and lower deck cabins; improvements to onboard systems; changes to the maintenance schedule; and a higher maximum take-off weight.

“We’ve spoken to our existing customers and have received positive feedback on the improvements envisioned for the A380plus,” said Frank Vermeire, Head of A380 Marketing at Airbus Commercial Aircraft.

A wide range of enhancements for A380plus

New winglets and other aerodynamic refinements to the wing are expected to result in up to 4 per cent reduction in fuel burn. These new winglets – shown for the first time on an A380 at the Paris Air Show – would be larger than the wingtip fences used today, but their design ensures the A380’s overall dimensions remain within the 80 x 80-meter envelope developed from the start by Airbus for the jetliner’s compatibility with airport infrastructure.

Recently-announced “cabin enablers” offered for A380s – including redesigned access stairs between decks, sidewall stowage removal, and new seating configurations – could be combined with a maximum take-off weight increased by three tonnes for the A380plus. This enables up to 80 additional seats to be fitted while maintaining the A380’s current flight range of 8,200 nm. – bringing total capacity up to 575 passengers. Alternatively, the aircraft’s range could be extended by 330 nm. at today’s passenger capacity.

Improvements to system components proposed in the A380plus configuration range from a fourth-generation passenger in-flight entertainment system to fuel pumps with high-slip induction motors derived from A350 XWB jetliner, which have simplified electronics for enhanced reliability. A new flight management system (the specialized computer that assists the flight crew in navigating the aircraft) also is offered in the A380plus definition.

Staying ahead of the competition with A380plus

Lastly, a modified maintenance calendar for the A380plus would enable the aircraft to spend more time aloft earning revenue. “By extending the maintenance intervals, an A380plus could produce $1 million net-present-value savings over 15 years,” said Vermeire. What’s more, he added, “every year, an A380plus would spend an average of six additional days flying instead of in a maintenance hangar – resulting in approximately $27 million in additional revenue.”

All told, these improvements add up to a 13 per cent operating cost-per-seat reduction for an A380plus compared to the current A380. “The market around the A380 is constantly moving,” concluded Vermeire. “We see the improvements in the A380plus as a great step to make the A380 even more efficient, ensuring it stays well ahead of the competition, while still offering passengers a unique flying experience in the best cabin in the sky.”

Cabin innovation: “Airspace by Airbus” comes to the A320 Family

The “Airspace by Airbus” concept for innovation in jetliner cabins, originally tailored for the widebody A350 XWB and the upcoming A330neo, is now available for the A320 Family – bringing market-leading comfort, innovation and design to the company’s single-aisle product line.

“By expanding the design language of Airspace by Airbus to our A320 Family, we will create a real family feel among these three aircraft types,” explained Paul Edwards, the Head of Design and Brand Management at Airbus Commercial Aircraft. “The Airspace cabin brand is built around four key pillars: comfort, ambience, services and design, which together create a more comfortable, relaxing and attractive environment for passengers, while providing a platform for airline operators to promote their brand.”

Edwards said Airspace already is equipped on more than 80 in-service A350 XWBs, with extremely positive passenger feedback.

New overhead bins for the A320 Family with Airspace

Passengers on A320 Family jetliners in both the NEO (New Engine Option) and CEO (Current Engine Option) versions will be able to enjoy Airspace’s unmatched comfort experience from 2020.

Among the cabin features specifically for Airspace-equipped A320 Family aircraft are completely new overhead stowage bins. Developed in a fixed configuration rather than the tilt-down bins widely used today, they accommodate bags as large as 24 x 16 x 10 inches and provide 40 per cent more volume. This simple-but-stylish solution offers unprecedented space for luggage while enhancing the boarding experience for passengers and cabin crewmembers alike.

New welcome lighting in the entrance area and iconic ceiling lighting complement the full-colour RGB mood lighting system, helping to create a unique mood, ambience and atmosphere.

In addition, A320 Family lavatories are updated to match the Airspace features developed for the A330neo and A350 XWB – including ambient sound, aroma dispensers and antibacterial surfaces – further enhancing this area. Careful interior arrangement and clever design provides improved spaciousness as well.

Edwards said the lavatory enhancements are considered by Airbus as an important element for the enhanced in-flight experience with Airspace, adding: “other than the passenger seat, this is one the area aboard an aircraft that is visited by almost everyone while airborne.”

Giving “every single millimetre” to passengers

For the A320 Family’s Airspace cabin, Airbus has placed an emphasis on personal space. “We’ve increased the width of the cabin by approximately an inch in the important head and shoulder areas,” Edwards said. “The designers worked very closely with engineers, and found every millimetre we could to give back to the passenger.”

Further boosting the personal space are new ergonomic sidewalls that also improve visibility thanks to improved window surrounds with shades that fully retract when in the raised position.

Airbus makes Paris Air Show headlines on opening day

In addition to announcing the expansion of “Airspace by Airbus” and introducing the A380plus developmental study, Airbus opened the Paris Air Show with two commercial order announcements from leasing customers.

GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), the aviation leasing and financing arm of GE, signed a firm order for 100 A320neo Family jetliners, to be powered by CFM International LEAP-1A engines. This order increases the total number of Airbus jetliners ordered by GECAS to almost 600 – of which 220 are members of the A320neo Family.

“The feedback from our customers [on the A320neo] has been extremely positive in terms of fuel efficiency and noise abatement,” said Alec Burger, President and CEO of GECAS at a press conference in the Airbus pavilion at Le Bourget Airport. “This contract is a continuation of a great relationship with Airbus, and we look forward to the road ahead.”

Separately, Air Lease Corporation placed a firm order for 12 additional A321neo aircraft, raising the overall number of Airbus jetliners which it has received, or are on order, to 279 – of which 209 are from the single-aisle A320 Family and the other 70 are widebodies.

Airbus also welcomed a very important guest today to the Paris Air Show, with French President Emmanuel Macron arriving in the morning for his official visit and exhibit tour aboard an Airbus A400M military airlifter operated by the French Air Force.

During the inbound flight, Macron watched the A400M’s flight crew in action – riding in a cockpit jump seat. After landing at Le Bourget Airport, the French president was accompanied by Airbus Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders for a walkaround of the company’s aircraft on display."
Airbus Helicopters reveals Racer high-speed demonstrator configuration - Airbus,"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0wNi1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtcmV2ZWFscy1yYWNlci1oaWdoLXNwZWVkLWRlbW9uc3RyYXRvctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

Project developed in the frame of Clean Sky 2 research programme

Tomasz Krysinski, Head of Research and Innovation at Airbus Helicopters (front row, left), and Guillaume Faury, CEO of Airbus Helicopters (second , front row) at the Racer unveiling.

Marignane, 20 June 2017 - Airbus Helicopters has unveiled today at the Paris air show the aerodynamic configuration of the high speed demonstrator it is developing as part of the Clean Sky 2 European research programme. Codenamed Racer, for Rapid And Cost-Effective Rotorcraft, this demonstrator will incorporate a host of innovative features and will be optimised for a cruise speed of more than 400 km/h. It will aim at achieving the best trade-off between speed, cost-efficiency, sustainability and mission performance. Final assembly of the demonstrator is expected to start in 2019, with a first flight the next year.

“Today we unveil our bold vision for the future of high-speed rotorcraft,” said Guillaume Faury, Airbus Helicopters CEO. “This new project, pulling together the skills and know-how of dozens of European partners through the Clean Sky 2 initiative, aims to bring increased speed and range at the right cost, thanks to a simple, safe and proven aerodynamic formula. It will pave the way for new time-sensitive services for 2030 and beyond, setting new benchmarks for high-speed helicopter transportation.”

The Racer demonstrator will be built around a simple architecture, ensuring safety and cost-efficiency. An innovative “box-wing” design, optimised for aerodynamic efficiency, will provide lift in cruise mode while isolating passengers during ground operations from the “pusher” lateral rotors designed to generate thrust in forward flight.

Optimised for performance and low acoustic signature, these lateral rotors as well as the main rotor will be driven by two RTM322 engines. An “eco mode” will be tested by the engine manufacturer to demonstrate an electrically-powered “start and stop” of one engine in flight, thus generating fuel savings and increasing range. The Racer demonstrator will also benefit from a hybrid metallic-composite airframe, specifically designed for low weight and low recurring costs. It will also be equipped with a new high voltage direct current electrical generation, which will significantly contribute to weight reduction.

Building upon the success of the self-funded X3 demonstrator, which validated the “compound” aerodynamic configuration – a combination of a traditional main rotor and innovative lateral rotors – the Racer project will bring this concept closer to an operational design and demonstrate its suitability for a wide spectrum of missions where increased speed and efficiency will bring significant added value for citizens and operators. This is especially the case for emergency medical services and search and rescue operations, as well as for public services, commercial air transport and private and business aviation.

Delta Orders 10 more A321s - Airbus,"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0wNi1kZWx0YS1vcmRlcnMtMTAtbW9yZS1hMzIxc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aircraft are in addition to 30 ordered by Delta in May



After announcing orders for 30 incremental Airbus A321ceo aircraft just last month, Atlanta, Georgia (U.S.)-based Delta Air Lines has placed an order for 10 more of the aircraft. The agreement was announced today at the Paris Air Show.



Like previous Delta orders for the A321, the 10 aircraft announced today are for the Current Engine Option version of the largest Airbus A320 Family member. The airline took delivery of its first A321 in March of last year. Delta now has ordered a total of 122 A321s, each powered by CFM56 engines from CFM International.

“The A321 is fast becoming a favorite aircraft of our customers and employees alike,” said Greg May, Delta’s Senior Vice President – Supply Chain Management and Fleet. “Its excellent operating economics and customer capacity also make it a great fit for our U.S. domestic network.”

“This order for 10 more A321s from Delta shows yet again the confidence this great airline has in this great aircraft,” said John Leahy, Chief Operating Officer – Customers for Airbus Commercial Aircraft. “Passengers, airline crews and investors look to the A320 Family to deliver unsurpassed comfort, economy and reliability. We are most gratified to keep providing Delta with the aircraft platforms on which they can deliver their own, unique brand of ‘service and hospitality from the heart.’”

All of Delta’s A321s feature fuel-saving Sharklets – lightweight composite wingtip devices that offer up to 4 percent fuel-burn savings. This environmental benefit gives airlines the option of extending their range up to 100 nautical miles/185 kilometres or increasing payload capacity by some 1000 pounds/450 kilograms.

Many of Delta’s A321s are being delivered from the Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility in Mobile, Alabama. The airline received its first U.S.-manufactured A321 last year. By the end of 2017, the Airbus facility in Mobile is expected to produce four aircraft per month, most going to Airbus’ U.S. customers.

As of the end of May, Delta was flying a fleet of 188 Airbus aircraft, including 146 A320 Family members and 42 A330 widebodies. Later this year, Delta will become the first U.S. airline to operate the new Airbus A350 XWB, or eXtra Wide Body aircraft. Delivery of Delta’s first A350 is slated for this summer.

Hit the gallery below for a full tour.

A revamped A380

Towering above everything around it was a double-decker A380, the world's largest commercial airliner. But this wasn't your standard A380 that's been plying the skies for the last decade. Rather, it was the first A380plus, a proposed new version of the aircraft that Airbus hopes will win it more A380 orders.

As CNET's Katie Collins wrote on Monday, the A380plus uses the existing A380 design, but adds new sweeping winglets to reduce fuel costs by four percent. Airbus also promises that the A380plus will have longer intervals between maintenance cycles, which will keep the airplane in the air (and carrying paying passengers) more of the time.

The ultimate goal is to make the A380 cheaper to operate, partly by adding 80 additional seats beyond what a current A380 typically accommodates. With a redesigned interior and an extra row of seats on the bottom deck (for an 11-across arrangement), the A380plus carry 575 passengers in a typical four-class configuration. How that will translate to passenger comfort remains to be seen, but on paper it sounds tight for a long-haul flight.

A321neo and A350-1000

Parked next door were two new airliners, the A321neo and the A350-1000. The A321neo is part of Airbus's new-generation A320 family of aircraft. Also designed to be more efficient and cheaper to operate -- neo stands for ""New Engine Option"" -- the A321neo has a lengthened fuselage over the existing A321 and ""sharklet"" winglets. Able to fit between 206 and 240 passengers, the A321neo started flying with airlines last month.

This is the first Paris trip for the larger A350-1000. The stretched version of the A350-900 only made its first flight last November. Carrying between 369 and 400 passengers, it promises better efficiency and cheaper operating and maintenance costs thanks to new engines and a lighter cabin built from composite materials (similar to the 787). The first delivery to Qatar Airways should happen this October.

Airbus's Racer concept could be both. Unveiled in Paris, the Racer would take off and land using a standard rotor like an existing helicopter. But once it's in the air, it uses two rear-facing ""pusher"" rotors to help achieve lift. Once it starts flying level, the main rotor slows down, letting the wing and other rotors do much of the lifting work. Top speed should be 400 km per hour or 249 miles per hour.

The Racer is based on the Airbus X3 helicopter, but stands to improve on its predecessor by being cheaper to operate. Also, by placing the second set of rotors behind the cabin, Airbus promises a quieter ride for passengers. Final assembly of the first Racer should take place in 2019, with a first flight following that year.

A floating black box

In the category of smaller and incredibly useful innovations, Airbus also announced a new ""black box"" flight recorder that can float on water. In the event of an airplane crashing on water, the box will be ejected from the aircraft so it can float in a protective case. A beacon will help alert search teams to its location. As a further improvement, the cockpit recording time will be increased to 25 hours (most current black boxes only record for up to 2 hours). Airbus says it will begin fitting the new black boxes into its entire range of aircraft."
Airbus launches new A320 Airspace interior - Airbus,"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0wNi1haXJidXMtbGF1bmNoZXMtbmV3LWEzMjAtYWlyc3BhY2UtaW50ZXJpb3LSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

Award-winning design providing additional comfort; ambience and service

Featuring the largest overhead bin in its class

Expanding on their successful 2016 introduction of the A330neo and A350, Airbus announced the A320 joins the Airspace family. The brand DNA is based on a consistent range of strong cabin product elements which provide both tangible benefits to passengers and differentiation to airlines. The A320 will not only share common cockpit ergonomics with the wide-bodies, but will also have a common cabin design language and the latest technology. Some of the enhanced elements of the new interior include:

• The Largest Overhead Storage Compartment (OHSC) in its Class: Called the “Airspace Bin”, it not only allows eight, instead of five bags, per four-frame bin, but also accommodates bigger and heavier bags stowed vertically.

• Iconic Ceiling Lighting: Featuring a fully customized on-board luminary experience, that begins at the entrance with a welcoming ambiance and continues throughout the aircraft with variable lighting features.

• New Sidewall Panels with Increased Cabin Width: One more inch at shoulder level for extra personal space.

• New Window Bezel: The new fully-integrated window shades provide passengers more window space and unobstructed view, evoking the feel of the A350.

• New Lavatory Design: The new spacious design also features coloured mood lighting, along with anti-bacterial coatings, automatic aroma dispenser, sound and optional touchless options.

• Coloured LED Lighting: Leveraging 16.4 million colour options, the new custom-cabin mood lighting creates a personalized in-flight experience at 30,000 feet throughout the cabin.

• Harmonized Door Surround: The new lines of the frames match the Airspace design of the A350 XWB and the A330neo.

“The A350 XWB cabin has proven extremely popular, with great feedback not only from passengers, but from design professionals,” commented Dr. Kiran Rao, Executive Vice President, Product Strategy, Airbus Commercial Aircraft. “This was great validation that gave us confidence to apply the design language to the A330neo and now to the A320 Family.”

Airlines expressed great interest in the new A320 Airspace’s increased overhead storage when revealed to customers at AIX Expo in April. “The A320 offers airlines 40 percent more volume for their passengers’ bags, accommodating larger carry-on bag dimensions than competing single-aisle airliners,” said Ingo Wuggetzer, Vice President, Cabin Marketing. “More overhead space means quicker boarding times, a value-add for passenger, and a better overall experience.”

Additional features such as the less obtrusive cabin sidewall panels and lavatory options (‘Smart-Lav’ and ‘Space-Flex’) maintain a consistent design to the popular Airspace wide-body series. Passengers will also appreciate the modular IFE platform with overhead video and in-seat audio/video on-demand, as well as the provision for in-seat power, wireless flexible connectivity and mobile telephony (GSM on board). The full Airspace Interior package is targeted for 2020 and will retrofit to the current hardware.

Airbus is a global leader in aeronautics, space and related services. In 2016, it generated revenues of €67billion and employed a workforce of around 134,000. Airbus offers the most comprehensive range of passenger airliners from 100 to more than 600 seats. Airbus is also a European leader providing tanker, combat, transport and mission aircraft, as well as Europe’s number one space enterprise and the world’s second largest space business. In helicopters, Airbus provides the most efficient civil and military rotorcraft solutions worldwide.

Airbus and AirAsia teams have been working closely in direct collaboration with users in Reliability, Safety, and Operations. Together they have deployed the Skywise data platform, integrated data from across disparate sources, and developed new capabilities against AirAsia's specific and immediate needs, including time series analysis of large-scale DataBird sensor data, component reliability, and repetitive fault analysis. Key results include: The deployment of the data platform and integrated several years’ worth of AMOS data across all AOCs as well as PFRs; The deployment of component reliability, ‘rogue component’, and repetitive-fault applications which will allow reliability and maintenance teams to perform analyses at scale to improve the reliability of the fleet; Continuous training on ‘Quiver’ – a Skywise application which allows users to visualise and analyse large-scale sensor data to perform flight-ops analysis, predictive maintenance, and troubleshooting.

Delta Air Lines to work with Airbus on expanding the value of Airbus’ Predictive Digital Solutions using the Skywise platform

Delta Air Lines and Airbus have been collaborating closely in developing advanced Predictive digital solutions to boost and deliver airline efficiency. Starting in 2016, Delta has deployed Airbus’ Prognostics and Risks Management (PRM) application to support its Engineering and Maintenance Control Center activities, particularly for its Airbus A330 fleet. This has enabled Delta to effectively prevent in advance failures on components and systems and thus mitigate operational interruptions (OI). Building on this valuable experience, Airbus is now working to expand the power of predictive modelling by migrating PRM models onto the Airbus Skywise platform. In doing so, Delta (and other airline users) could in the future reduce their OI events by another 15 percent, compared with using the today’s standalone PRM solution.

easyJet deploys Airbus Skywise platform for fleet Predictive Maintenance

Airbus and easyJet have deployed the new Skywise data platform to enable a fleet-wide predictive maintenance capability. This capability has successfully prevented technical delays normally caused removals of aircraft components including integrated drive generators (IDGs), high pressure valves (HPVs) and radio altimeters. By working closely together with easyJet, the Airbus design office and the airline were able to address easyJet’s ‘top-100 operational issues’. This work has resulted in the building and deployment of a fully customized application which allows actionable items to be performed preventing unnecessary delays for customers. In addition, easyJet has been using ‘DataBird’ (launched at Paris Air Show with Rockwell Collins as “FOMAX”) on two aircraft with the richest aircraft technical data to support existing hardware, this has been accessed on the underlying platform directly using ‘Quiver’ to measure the effectiveness of maintenance actions and conduct fleet-wide analysis on aircraft technical and maintenance data.

Emirates uses Skywise for Real-Time Health Monitoring and predictive maintenance

Emirates is collaborating with Airbus to reduce operational disruptions by sharing data on the new Skywise open data platform. The airline is benefitting from the Airbus Real-Time Health Monitoring, providing predictive maintenance and enhanced diagnostic to improve its fleet performance, optimize its operations, and make quicker and more informed decisions. Moreover, in case of unexpected technical issues arising, this Airbus predictive and monitoring capacity allows prompt mitigation solutions while final fixes are being implemented. So far, the Airbus Real-Time Health Monitoring and predictive maintenance has demonstrated a significant gain in operational reliability of around one percent for Emirates’ fleet.

Application development for Skywise underway with Hong Kong Airlines

Airbus, and its dedicated flight operations subsidiary, NAVBLUE, are already working with Hong Kong Airlines, to develop a new data analytics tool which will help airlines to avoid fuel overconsumption on descent and approach flight phases. This solution is called “IDLE Factor Optimization Tool”, and is part of the new suite of applications within the new Airbus Skywise Open Data Platform which leverages customers’ data and provide then with added-value. IDLE factor automatically adjusts the aircraft’s flight plan computation of the Flight Management System (FMS) according to the aircraft’s actual performance in real-time. When fully deployed, application will help airlines to realize significant fuel savings of up to 70kg per descent per aircraft for a single-aisle aircraft, and as much as 210kg for an A380.

jetBlue deploys applications to harness the value of Airbus Digital Solutions and Skywise

JetBlue and Airbus have been collaborating closely in developing advanced digital solutions to boost and deliver Airline efficiency. Together they have deployed Maintenance Mobility application (to support Line and Base Maintenance activities) in 2016 and joint work is ongoing to deploy Scheduled Maintenance Optimizer (for optimising heavy maintenance planning and costs) end of summer 2017. These new applications are complemented by the airline’s ongoing work with Airbus on Skywise with integrated data across disparate sources, to develop new capabilities encompassing engineering investigations, component reliability analyses, and enhancing maintenance operations.

Peach uses Skywise data platform to automate quality monitoring, and interactively visualise flight paths

Airbus and Peach have deployed Airbus’ Skywise open data platform. This allows data to be integrated from across the airline’s disparate sources and enables various capabilities required by the airline including quality reliability reporting, component reliability and safety analysis. In particular, the platform enables Peach to automate the quality monitoring process and produce key metrics grouped by ATA chapter and aircraft in seconds. Reports which used to take days are now produced in only a few clicks. For component reliability, another application uses data from the platform to track unscheduled removals over time, run “Weibull” distributions over the data, and determine the optimal replacement schedule. Another benefit to Peach from the platform is the capability to interactively visualise flight paths using a special application called “Flight Path 360” This can drill-down on select parts of a flight based on key sensor data measurement.

Airbus shows off fancy new cabin design - CNN,"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbW9uZXkuY25uLmNvbS8yMDE3LzA2LzIwL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLW5ldy1haXJsaW5lci1jYWJpbi1pbnRlcmlvci1haXJzcGFjZS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For millions of airline passengers, the cabin can make or break the experience.

European jetliner manufacturer Airbus announced Monday at the Paris Air Show it would give the cabin of its single-aisle A320 airliners a glitzy make over starting in 2020.

The new design borrows significantly from the A320's twin-aisle siblings, the A330neo and A350 XWB, which are both getting a similar cabin makeover.

Airbus claims it is now providing airlines and passengers the largest overhead bins in its class. Its new bins fit eight bags instead of the usual five with space for larger bags stored on their side, the aircraft maker said.

Other features of the new design include:

Increased cabin width — new sidewall panels offer an extra inch of shoulder space

Window shades that give more window area and better views

A new lavatory design including mood lighting, automatic aroma dispenser and anti-bacterial coatings

Interior cabin lighting is also a central part of the new design, including ceiling illumination meant to welcome passengers from the moment they first step aboard the airplane. Airlines will be able to customize the cabin and pick from 16.4 million color LED lighting options.

In 2010, Airbus arch-rival Boeing introduced its own ""sky interior"" cabin revamp for its single-aisle 737 airliners. Like Airbus, Boeing gave its small jets an interior inspired by its larger 787 Dreamliner.

In addition to larger and easier to open overhead storage bins, Sky Interior's lighting scheme matches different times of day to prompt passengers to feel more at home aboard and less like they were flying."
Airbus' A380plus Comes With Fuel-Saving Winglets and 80 More Seats - WIRED,"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9haXJidXMtYTM4MHBsdXMtd2luZ2xldHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The world’s largest airliner is struggling to stay aloft. Financially, that is. Airlines, it turns out, prefer the fuel efficiency of smaller planes like the Boeing 777 to the pack-em-in capacity of the Airbus A380. As a result, Airbus hasn’t scored any new orders for an A380 in more than a year.

Its big plan to turn things around? Launch a new version, make it cheaper to fly, and slap on some winglets.

This week at the Paris Air Show, Airbus announced the revamped “A380plus,” a refresh that packs even more passengers into the super-jumbo and tweaks the wing design. The upswept winglets found on most modern airliners boost fuel efficiency by eliminating turbulent air vortices at the wingtips, reducing drag and improving aerodynamics.

The winglets stand 15 feet tall, and the design includes downward extensions that add another 4 feet. They could improve fuel efficiency by a significant 4 percent and—along with other improvements—cut operating expenses by 13 percent.

Airbus

That's crucial if Airbus wants to sell more planes. (The company is currently working through an unimpressive order book of just over 100 airplanes.)

The A380plus crams in 80 more seats by rejiggering the crew rest quarters and ditching the spiral staircase between the two levels in favor of a conventional one. The A380plus will carry 575 passengers in a four-class configuration. In a final play to draw customers, Airbus announced maintenance and inspection requirement changes that will minimize down-time and expense.

“This looks like a last-ditch effort to me,” says Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst with the Teal Group. “It's not conceivable that customers who didn't want a very large jet would suddenly change their mind just because of the addition of winglets.”

Still, Aboulafia sees a potential payoff from the aerodynamic tweaks, noting that “it's a bit of a mystery why the winglets weren't included with the original design,” given their well-documented benefits.

It may not win any new customers, but in an industry where every dollar counts, it counts for something."
Airbus Is Making Some of Its Most Popular Jets More Passenger-Friendly - Skift Travel News,"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTcvMDYvMjAvYWlyYnVzLWlzLW1ha2luZy1zb21lLW9mLWl0cy1tb3N0LXBvcHVsYXItamV0cy1tb3JlLXBhc3Nlbmdlci1mcmllbmRseS_SAWhodHRwczovL3NraWZ0LmNvbS8yMDE3LzA2LzIwL2FpcmJ1cy1pcy1tYWtpbmctc29tZS1vZi1pdHMtbW9zdC1wb3B1bGFyLWpldHMtbW9yZS1wYXNzZW5nZXItZnJpZW5kbHkvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Is this a game-changer? No. But let's give Airbus some credit for making short-haul travel a little more pleasant. Too bad passengers must wait until 2020 to see the new cabins.

Airline seats may be getting tighter, but by 2020, passengers on some Airbus planes might be a little more comfortable. Or at least they may enjoy their surroundings more.

The manufacturer on Monday unveiled a new passenger cabin for its Airbus A319, A320, and A321 jets, flown on short-and medium-length routes by many of the world’s largest airlines. With the refreshed cabin, Airbus essentially will match what it offers on its A350, a long-haul aircraft, with one major exception — the A320’s interior humidity will not change. The A350 is designed for much longer routes, and because Airbus engineered its cabins to have more humidity than most jets, A350 passengers generally arrive feeling fresher and less jet-lagged than usual.

Perhaps most important to passengers for the A320 family, Airbus will add new sidewall panels that will increase cabin width, giving travelers slightly more shoulder space. Other improvements include large overhead bins capable of handling eight bags, rather than five in older models, new LED lighting, and “iconic” ceiling lighting. Airbus is also redesigning the ring around the aircraft’s windows, promising passengers will have better views.

The A320 family is Airbus’ best-selling aircraft, with the company delivering more than 7,000 since 1988. With a few big exceptions — Southwest Airlines, Copa Airlines and Ryanair among them — most big airlines rely on the A319, A320, and A321 for at least some flights that last between one and seven hours.

Like Boeing, Airbus wants to deliver more customer-friendly aircraft, but it has little say in what’s likely the most important feature for travelers — legroom. Airlines decide how many seats to install, and in recent years, they’ve been tightening space between rows. Most airlines say that’s the only way they can deliver low fares passengers want.

The good news is that Airbus’ tweaks should not, on their own, allow airlines to cram more seats in the A320 family. On widebody aircraft, after a manufacturer makes slight cabin changes, airlines can sometimes can add an extra seat per row. Indeed, as part of recent changes to the double-decker Airbus A380, airlines now can install 11 seats per row, one more than before. But the A320 remains too tight for more than six seats across.

Because Airbus has little sway in seating, its innovation usually comes elsewhere, often by making the cabin appear inviting. In this case, Airbus is also making changes to the restroom, promising anti-bacterial coatings and an automatic “aroma dispenser.” Still, at least on cost-focused airlines, bathrooms could be tight, as many will install what Airbus calls the “Space-Flex” lavatory. It’s a relatively new innovation that allows airlines to put restrooms in the rear of the aircraft, near the tail, in what previously was underused space.

If they want, airlines will be able to retrofit current A319s, A320s, and A321s to match what’s coming in 2020, but generally few carriers want to spend the time or money to refresh an already adequate aircraft. Often, airlines will fly a jet for 25 to 30 years, and while they may replace seats and entertainment systems, they don’t often make many other major changes."

Airbus

In a bid to resuscitate sales of its struggling flagship A380, Airbus unveiled a new version of its iconic superjumbo with a host of upgrades on Monday at the 2017 Paris Air Show.

Airbus claims the plane — dubbed the A380plus — has been upgraded in five main areas including fuel efficiency and passenger capacity.

Airbus hopes the new development will make the A380, which hasn't generated a single new order in more than a year, more financially attractive for airlines.

""The A380plus is an efficient way to offer even better economics and improved operational performance at the same time,"" Airbus COO John Leahy said in a statement. ""It is a new step for our iconic aircraft to best serve worldwide fast-growing traffic and the evolving needs of the A380 customers.""

The most obvious upgrade made to the A380 is the addition of a set of split winglets that are designed to curtail the effects of induced drag and wingtip vortices. Airbus claims the improved aerodynamics created by the winglets will boost the plane's fuel economy by 4%.

In addition, Airbus increased the A380's passenger capacity by a whopping 80 seats to lower the plane's unit operating costs. Even though the A380 is certified to fly with more than 850 passengers, the plane is usually configured to fly with 497 passengers. The A380plus's upgraded interior is expected to boost that capacity to 575 seats.

The airplane has made this happen in a variety of manners. At the front of the plane, the A380's grand staircase and pilots' rest quarters are gone. The grand staircase has been replaced by a tighter, space efficient version — making room for 20 additional passengers. At the same time, pilots' rest quarters have been merged with the flight attendants' crew rest facility on the lower deck of the plane — making way for three premium economy seats.

At the back of the plane, Airbus replaced the stylish spiral staircase with a traditional staircase. This allowed engineers to redesign the aft galley to create space for 14 more passengers.

On the upper deck, Airbus made room for 10 additional business class passengers by removing the side storage areas.

The final 34 are created to by increasing the numbers of seats per row— perhaps the last thing passengers want to hear.

In economy, Airbus increased capacity by cramming 11 seats into a row instead of 10 — thereby creating room for 23 more passengers. The seats are to be configured in a 3-5-3 layout with five seats in the center section.

Airbus

In premium economy, the A380plus will have nine-abreast seating instead of the traditional eight passengers per row. This is expected to make room for 11 passengers.

Over the past few years, Airbus has flirted with the possibility of an A380neo or New Engine Option with new fuel efficient engines, avionics, and a redesigned wing. The Neo is something Emirates, the A380's largest customer, has lobbied heavily for over the past few years. However, Airbus seems to have balked at the time and high development costs along with the prospect of few new customers in return.

The A380plus seems to be a stop-gap measure that may bring some of the savings of the full neo at a fraction of the development cost.

In total, Airbus claims the changes it has made for the Plus will reduce the cost per seat for the plane's customers by 13%.

No airlines have, thus far, taken up Airbus on its new and improved A380.

Both Boeing and Airbus have unveiled updated models of their planes at the 2017 Paris Air Show and shown very different focuses for the future. While Airbus has upgraded its biggest model, Boeing instead has focussed on smaller and more efficient planes. The new jets come as the international aviation industry is showing signs of cooling, with orders for new planes slowing down.

Just ahead of the show Airbus unveiled the A380plus, an upgrade of its A380 superjumbo with more efficient aerodynamics and 80 extra seats. The most noticeable changes to the plane are added winglets to the tips of the main wings, which Airbus claims will help the plane burn four percent less fuel than the old model.

The biggest passenger jet in the world, the A380 has seen its sales slump as airlines instead opt for smaller, more efficient twin-engine planes. The new A380 is an attempt to help larger planes make more economic sense, with Airbus claiming the overall improvements will cut costs for airlines by 13 percent per seat. Additionally, Airbus said the growing number of passengers in Asia and the Middle East will require jets with greater capacity, as airports in the region are already very congested.

The A380 has seen its sales slump as airlines instead opt for smaller, more efficient twin-engine planes

Boeing has taken a different direction with the launch of a new version of the twin-engine 737, the 737 Max 10. The Max 10 is 66 inches longer than the older Max 9 and has 10 extra seats, however the added size gives it a slightly smaller range. Boeing claims the model is extremely efficient and will have the lowest operating cost of any single-aisle plane ever produced

According to Bloomberg, Boeing has focussed on the 737 due to the lack of demand for jumbo passenger jets (such as its famous 747), and have even gone so far as to drop the four-engine plane category from its annual forecast. “We don’t see much demand for really big aircraft going forward’,’ said Randy Tinseth, Boeing’s Vice President for Marketing. “We find it hard to believe that Airbus will deliver the rest of their A380s in backlog.”

Slowing sales have taken their toll on Boeing, with the company announcing hundreds of layoffs in April.

Viva Air, the Latin America low cost carrier group owned by Irelandia Aviation, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Airbus for 50 A320 Family aircraft, comprising 35 A320neo and 15 A320ceo. The agreement paves the way for the group’s airlines VivaColombia and Viva Air Peru to base its fleet renewal and network growth on the A320 Family.



“Our customers are at the forefront of everything we do. This new fleet will allow us to continue leading the development of the low cost model throughout Latin America. We will be able to offer even lower fares thanks to further cost savings that these new aircraft will deliver,” said William Shaw, CEO and Founder of VivaColombia, a Viva Air company.

“Airbus is proud that Irelandia is once again entrusting the A320 Family with Viva Air’s growth and modernization strategy,” said John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer, Customers. “Viva Air will be able to rely on the unmatched productivity and fuel efficiency of the A320neo to renew its growing fleet and expand its network in Latin America.”

Viva Air recently launched Viva Air Peru, the sister airline of VivaColombia. Medellin-based VivaColombia operates nine A320 aircraft and Lima-based Viva Air Peru currently operates two, all with a capacity of 180 seats.

Viva Air is a Panamanian headquartered group created by Irelandia Aviation and led by Declan Ryan. Irelandia has successfully developed six low cost carriers around the world, namely Allegiant, Ryanair, Tigerair, VivaAerobus, VivaColombia and most recently Viva Air Peru. Combined, the airlines have a fleet of more than 420 aircraft and have carried over a billion passengers.

The A320 Family is the world’s best-selling single aisle product line. To date, the Family has won over 13,000 orders and more than 7,600 aircraft have been delivered to some 400 customers and operators worldwide. With one aircraft in four sizes (A318, A319, A320 and A321), the A320 Family seats from 100 to 240 passengers. The Family features the widest cabin in the single aisle market with 18” wide seats in Economy as standard.

With over 1,000 aircraft sold and a backlog of nearly 450, almost 650 Airbus aircraft are in operation throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. Since 1990, Airbus has secured over 60 percent of net orders in the region and in the past 10 years alone, Airbus has tripled its in-service fleet."
"Sales of 4-engine jumbo jets fading out at Boeing, Airbus - Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette","Sun, 25 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDE3L2p1bi8yNS9zYWxlcy1vZi00LWVuZ2luZS1qdW1iby1qZXRzLWZhZGluZy1vdXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing sees the future, and it doesn't include jumbo passenger jets. Not its own iconic 747. Not the Airbus A380.

The U.S. planemaker has dropped the category reserved for four-engine behemoths from its annual forecast for the commercial-aircraft market. Instead, Boeing predicts that airlines will use more efficient twin-engine jets for long-range flights -- like its 787 Dreamliner and 777X, or a midmarket plane that's on the drawing board.

By leaving so-called very large aircraft off its two-decade projection for a $6.05 trillion jetliner market, Boeing said it was reflecting a market reality: There is little to no chance of reviving sales of those models. The Chicago-based company and Airbus already had pared production of their biggest aircraft as orders dwindled, and Boeing has warned it may stop making the 747's passenger version.

""We don't see much demand for really big aircraft going forward,"" Randy Tinseth, Boeing's vice president for marketing, said at a briefing ahead of the Paris Air Show last week. ""We find it hard to believe that Airbus will deliver the rest of their A380s in backlog.""

Airbus still sees a long-term market for the planes although it didn't log a single A380 sale last year. The Toulouse, France-based manufacturer says airlines will need larger jets as passenger traffic doubles and congestion limits the number of flights into megahubs, particularly in Asia and the Middle East.

The European company projects potential industrywide sales of 1,400 of the largest commercial aircraft, valued at $454 billion through 2037. That compares with Boeing's 20-year forecast for 80 deliveries that Tinseth outlined last week at a Paris show presentation.

As the jumbo era ends at Boeing, the planemaker sees a new market emerging for midrange airplanes overlapping the largest single-aisle and smallest twin-aisle jets. That differs from the stance at Airbus, which announced plans at the Paris show to make enhancements to the A380 in the hopes of one day reviving orders.

""They went big and heavy, we went small and efficient,"" said Mike Delaney, Boeing vice president and general manager for airplane development. ""We'll overfly our competitors, put a lighter gauge on things.""

Airbus is refining the double-decker A380's design, including adding 15-foot winglets, to boost fuel efficiency by as much as 4 percent. Tinseth dismissed the strategy. ""Putting winglets on an airplane that's too big doesn't make that airplane any smaller,"" he said.

The mid-range model Boeing is developing would seat between 220 and 270 travelers and fly about 5,000 nautical miles. The goal is to spur growth with jetliners that avoid hubs and link smaller cities on routes that aren't properly matched to today's aircraft. Think Washington to Prague, Japan to India, or within China's ""Golden Triangle"" of Shanghai, Guangzhou and Beijing.

Airlines also could use the new jet -- dubbed the 797 or NMA, for new mid-market airplane -- on transcontinental flights to replace aging Boeing 757 and 767 jets. Budget carriers could graduate from single-aisle jets to the larger planes for more-popular routes.

Tinseth projects a potential market of 4,000 to 5,000 sales in that segment over 20 years.

Airbus has already made advances in that market with its largest single-aisle plane, the A321neo, and is exploring a stretched version that would carry more than 240 passengers. While that narrow-body would probably be cheaper than the new Boeing dual-aisle, the U.S. company sees a competitive advantage in a design that lets people board and disembark far more quickly.

Single-aisle aircraft like the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 will still rule the market, accounting for nearly three-quarters of total sales, according to Boeing's forecast. The planemaker predicts a need for 29,530 narrow-bodies valued at $3.18 trillion through 2036.

The next most popular type will be small wide-body aircraft, like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A330, accounting for 5,050 deliveries or 12 percent of forecast sales, Boeing predicts.

Sales of very large aircraft will probably be confined to Boeing's niche-market 747-8 freighter and a handful of jets for VIPs, like the next Air Force One for the U.S. president.

The hump-backed 747 -- which in 1970 ushered in a new era of mass long-range travel -- eventually will be replaced at the top of the jetliner food chain by Boeing's 777X. The first delivery for that 400-seat plane is scheduled for 2020.

""The biggest airplane in the market moving forward is going to be the 777X,"" Tinseth said.

"Airbus: First high power all-electric satellite, EUTELSAT 172B, launched by Ariane 5 - Airbus","Fri, 02 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0wNi1haXJidXMtZmlyc3QtaGlnaC1wb3dlci1hbGwtZWxlY3RyaWMtc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWV1dGVsc2F0LTE3MmLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

All-electric propulsion for orbit-raising and on-station manoeuvers for the first time on a high power satellite inaugurates significant mass savings on this class of mission Innovative payload technology will dynamically distribute power between spot beams to provide internet connectivity to aircraft over the Pacific

Kourou, 02/06/2017 – EUTELSAT 172B, the first high power all-electric telecommunications satellite worldwide built by Airbus for Eutelsat, one of the world’s leading satellite operators, has been successfully launched from Kourou, French Guiana by Ariane 5. The satellite will provide enhanced telecommunications, in-flight broadband and broadcast services for the Asia-Pacific region.

“We are the first company to demonstrate full electric propulsion for satellites of this size and capacity,” said Nicolas Chamussy, Head of Space Systems at Airbus. “With this spacecraft we are clearly setting a new benchmark - enabling powerful and complex satellites to be launched in the most cost efficient manner.”

EUTELSAT 172B combines electric power of 13 kW with a launch mass of around 3,500 kg only, thanks to the latest EOR (Electric Orbit Raising) version of Airbus’ highly reliable Eurostar E3000 platform.

Eutelsat 172B

Full electric propulsion for initial orbit raising and all on-station manoeuvres, with Xenon gas ejected at high speed using only electric power supplied by solar cells, relieves operators of the need to include tons of chemical propellant, leading to up to 40% mass savings on the satellite.

Customers can therefore either achieve a significant saving on launch costs, or a substantial increase of the payload power for a given mass. Furthermore the Hall Effect Technology used by Airbus makes transfer to the operational orbit significantly faster than other electric propulsion technologies.

Innovation solutions include two deployable robotic arms to orientate the satellite’s electric propulsion thrusters to control thrust direction and attitude during different phases of the mission. In addition, WALIS (Wide Angle Localisation Integrated System) is a proprietary network of ground stations developed by Airbus around the world, to enable Airbus engineers to control orbit raising operations until the satellite reaches geostationary orbit.

The development of Airbus’ Eurostar all electric satellites has been supported by ESA and space agencies of European countries, in particular in France by CNES in the framework of the PIA programme (Plan d’Investissements d’Avenir) and in the UK by the UK Space Agency.

EUTELSAT 172B hosts three distinct payloads that will strengthen Eutelsat’s capabilities across Asia-Pacific markets: a C-band payload, a regular Ku-band payload and a high throughput Ku-band payload designed for in-flight connectivity along Pacific air corridors.in that regard, the satellite features an innovative multi-port amplifier (MPA) on the payload to distribute dynamically the satellite’s power between its 11 spot beams to provide internet connectivity for aircraft flying across the Asia-Pacific region.

The flexibility of the MPA means that more power can be allocated to each spot beam as demand increases giving aircraft passengers a better service. The MPA technology was developed by Airbus as part of the European Space Agency’s Advanced Research in Telecommunications Systems programme and supported by the UK Space Agency.

Additive layer manufacturing, or 3D printing, is further exploited for several elements on this satellite, including for a single printed bracket that is 35% lighter than and quicker to manufacture than the complex component it replaced.

Here's what it'll be like to hail one of Airbus' futuristic flying taxis - The Verge,"Sat, 17 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDE3LzYvMTcvMTU4MTMyNTAvdmFoYW5hLWFpcmJ1cy1mbHlpbmctY2FyLXZpZGVvLXBhcmlzLWFpci1zaG930gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Deborah is a computer-generated human who needs to get from the Hotel de Anza in San Jose to Yerba Buena Gardens in San Francisco, post haste. Traffic on the 101 is a nightmare, so rather than spending hours in traffic, she whips out her smartphone and hails an electric, vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft through Vahana, the on-demand, aviation project. Total fare: $77. Total flight time: 18 minutes.

This is the future envisioned by Airbus, which operates Vahana through its A³ subsidiary. For almost a year now, the aeronautics giant has been working on developing a fleet of electric, autonomous, multirotor VTOL vehicles that can be used to fly from rooftop to rooftop in dense cities where traffic is often at a standstill. And next week, A³ will be showing off this vision at the Paris Air Show in an effort to get aviation nerds excited about the future of flying taxis.

(An important note: I know a lot of publications have taken to calling these aircraft “flying cars” because clickbait. But for a number of reasons that I’ve outline here, I won’t be using that nomenclature. It’s dumb.)

The concept video produced by A³ is pretty consistent with the visions of others that are developing their own VTOL projects, like Uber and Google co-founder Larry Page. Thanks to improvements in battery technology and artificial intelligence, technologists predict we’re on the cusp of a revolution in urban aviation. The skies above our cities are about to become abuzz with flying taxis.

And everyone from electric vehicle charging companies to real estate firms are jumping on the flying bandwagon. The conventional wisdom is that these VTOL aircraft will likely be deployed in an on-demand, Uber-like capacity, which theoretically will make fares cheap enough so that its not just the 1 percent using it."

Rethinking Urban Air Mobility - Airbus,"Sat, 17 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE3LTA2LXJldGhpbmtpbmctdXJiYW4tYWlyLW1vYmlsaXR50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Increased urbanisation is pushing our cities’ transport systems to the limits, costing valuable time and money. Airbus believes the solution lies in the sky. From flying vehicles to helicopters on demand, its portfolio of ground-breaking projects is helping to make urban air mobility a reality.

City streets are often a blur of movement: cars, trucks, buses, trams, scooters and bicycles all jostle for space, trying to make their way from A to B as quickly as possible. Sometimes, though, that motion grinds to a halt. As traffic jams grow, frustration rises, time is wasted and money lost. Getting around can quickly become a nightmare. Airbus wants to fix this.

Instead of looking at ground level, it is focusing its attention on a part of the city that remains congestion-free: the sky. “Imagine a world in which city travel is faster, safer, more reliable and more stress-free. Adding a third dimension to urban transport networks would revolutionise the way we live,” says Mathias Thomsen, General Manager for Urban Air Mobility at Airbus. “Streets would be safer, air pollution would be cut dramatically and we would have more free time.”

Thomsen is overseeing several urban air mobility projects at Airbus, from on-demand helicopter rides to shared flying vehicles and delivery drones. If that sounds like science fiction, the company is building on currently viable technology and plans to flight test a single passenger demonstrator as early as the end of this year.

Solutions to the urban mobility problem are certainly required. Urbanisation is a dominant trend around the globe and by 2030, more than 60% of the world’s population will be living in cities, stretching struggling ground transportation networks even further. In the EU, traffic congestion currently costs almost €100 billion a year. By 2030, it could be closer to €300 billion. American drivers lose an average of 42 hours a year in traffic jams. “We can’t keep overloading our roads,” says Thomsen, “but what we can do is take advantage of the space above us.”

Autonomous city flight

Airbus has already carried out a successful trial in São Paulo of its helicopter ride-hailing service Voom, which aims to ease congestion by making helicopter travel more accessible and affordable. Elsewhere, teams from Silicon Valley to Europe and Asia are working to create entirely new vehicles. CityAirbus is an electric vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) vehicle for up to four passengers, while Vahana aims to create a similar mode of transport for individual travellers or cargo transport. In Singapore, the company is working with the country’s National University on the Skyways project to test a parcel transport system using autonomous drones.

While each mission has its own individual requirements, Thomsen says there is an overlap of several core technologies Airbus is developing. “Quite simply, in today’s environment, any new solution has to be electrically driven, so batteries and charging stations are indispensable. Vahana and, eventually, CityAirbus will be autonomous to help facilitate safe operation in busier airspace, making reliable sense-and-avoid technology an important aspect. And mass-produced lightweight composite structures will enable cost-effective vehicle construction across large scales.”

New possibilities for urban planning

Alongside these engineering and manufacturing hurdles lie an array of other challenges to overcome. New vehicle types require certification, pilot training and air space regulation. Airbus is also working on consumer-facing tools, air traffic management systems and how to integrate the necessary ground infrastructure, such as charging stations and places to get on and off, into existing cityscapes.

“We’re already discussing some of these topics with a number of city authorities and they are very excited about the possibilities,” says Thomsen. “When you start thinking vertically about urban development it opens a whole range of new opportunities, from modes of transport to revolutionary building design.”

But is the public ready to fly through cities in autonomous vehicles? “It will certainly take time for this to be accepted, but we are confident. Airbus is a trusted name around the world and safety remains our number one priority,” answers Thomsen. “The reception to our air and ground concept Pop.Up at the Geneva Motor Show earlier this year was extremely positive. I think we’ll soon be seeing self-driving vehicles on the road on a regular basis. Eventually, autonomous transport, on the ground and in the air, will become part of everyday life.”

For now, though, Airbus is focusing on continuing to lay the foundations for an entirely new industry. “Nobody has ever done anything like this before, so it’s a learning curve. We expect to learn a lot from the projects we are putting in place now, which are just the beginning of a new generation of urban mobility.”

An Update From Paris: Airbus Puts Lipstick on Its A380 While Boeing Keeps Stretching Its 737 – Cranky Flier - Cranky Flier,"Thu, 22 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vY3Jhbmt5ZmxpZXIuY29tLzIwMTcvMDYvMjIvYW4tdXBkYXRlLWZyb20tcGFyaXMtYWlyYnVzLXB1dHMtbGlwc3RpY2stb24taXRzLWEzODAtd2hpbGUtYm9laW5nLWtlZXBzLXN0cmV0Y2hpbmctaXRzLTczNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This week is the Paris Air Show, the pinnacle of the air show circuit (alternating with Farnborough every other year). It’s usually an opportunity for aircraft manufacturers to shine by revealing a slew of orders along with future development plans. This year, those order books are somewhat lighter, especially on the widebody side. So it’s the future development that’s been making the most news.

The A380plus



Airbus is making waves on the bigger end of the spectrum with a package of improvements to try to salvage the A380 as a viable aircraft going forward. Orders for the A380 have been anemic since the beginning, at best, with only Emirates preventing a complete and total financial disaster for the company. Of the 317 ordered, Emirates is responsible for 142 of them. And though there are still 100 airplanes left to be delivered, many of those seem to be on shaky ground. There hasn’t been a new order since 2015 and the production line is being slowed to stretch it out as much as possible.

With that backdrop, doesn’t it sound like the end is near? Nobody would have faulted Airbus for calling it quits, except maybe for Emirates, but Airbus has chosen a different path. It’s as if it looked at the airplane, figured out a few cheap tweaks it could make, and then decided to give it one more push before raising the the white flag. With that “winning” recipe in place, we now have a plan for the A380plus. There’s no commitment to actually building it right now, but with these changes, Airbus hopes it can get enough airlines onboard to get the program off life support. It’s a twist on the old saying… if they come, Airbus will build it.

So what is this upgrade? It’s really just a combination of two things. First, there are new fancy-looking winglets along with “wing refinements” that result in a 4 percent fuel burn savings. Then there are the interior changes that were released earlier this year which effectively allow Airbus to stuff more passengers in the airplane. The bottom deck will see room for 11 seats across in coach (think 3-5-3) instead of 10. These two things mashed together result in a 13 percent reduction in cost per seat, depending upon configuration, of course.

Lower cost is always nice, but that’s never been the main problem with the airplane. It’s just too big. Now Airbus is effectively making it bigger (in terms of capacity), so how is that going to be more attractive? It won’t.

Those who already believe in the airplane may like this, and maybe it will convince some of the less firm orders to stick around. But I find it hard to believe it’s going to sway any new airlines to place an order. I can’t recall anyone saying, “gee, if only it could hold 80 more people, then we’d be interested.”

For what it’s worth, Airbus’s main A380 customer, Emirates, isn’t impressed. It will undoubtedly change its tune quickly if a rush of new orders comes in making it a more sustainable aircraft in the future, but that seems unlikely to happen with this enhancement alone.

The 737 MAX 10

Boeing has started talking more about a “middle of the market” aircraft to fall between the 737 and 787 families, but despite some buzz this week, we’re not there yet. Instead, the biggest tangible news was about Boeing following a time-honored tradition of stretching the crap out of its 737 family. Boeing officially rolled out the 737 MAX 10, the 10th and biggest iteration of the 50-year old aircraft.

It’s incredible to think that this airplane is nearly double the size of the old 737-100 in terms of passenger capacity. It’s hard to believe these airplanes are even related, but sure enough, that old fuselage cross-section is the same, as are many other characteristics. Oh sure, plenty is different, as you’d hope considering it’s been 50 years, but it’s still just Boeing being Boeing (or Boeing being McDonnell Douglas) and trying to tweak an existing airplane as much as humanly possible to serve every need.

What need does this serve besides providing a long racetrack for toilet paper rolling down the aisle? Well it’s suppose to be Boeing’s competitor to the A321neo. They have roughly the same number of seats and, according to Boeing, the MAX 10 will have a 5 percent lower operating cost per seat than the A321neo. There’s a lot of sniping back and forth about which will have more range, but the bottom line is that if you need the range, the Airbus A321LR will win. That’s the closest thing we have to a 757 replacement today, though it’s been very hard to find anything to replace the 757.

After just a few days, the 737 MAX 10 has hundreds of orders, but don’t let the marketing fluff fool you. Many of those are just converted orders that were previously for a different version of the airplane. United, for example, made a splash by converting 100 orders for the 737 MAX 9 into orders for the MAX 10 instead.

—

The common thread here is that there really wasn’t anything overly exciting. Airbus is trying to revive its giant while Boeing is just trying to fill out its product line with another stretch of an already overly-stretched airplane. The more exciting discussion is about what the future may hold for a new clean-sheet aircraft, especially in that middle-of-the-market size. But despite the hype, there’s really very little to discuss… yet."
Airbus Is Planning Europe's Next-Gen Fighter - Popular Mechanics,"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHVsYXJtZWNoYW5pY3MuY29tL21pbGl0YXJ5L2F2aWF0aW9uL2EyNjkzMy9haXJidXMtcGxhbm5pbmctbmV4dC1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLWV1cm9wZWFuL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European aircraft giant Airbus is in the early stages of planning what very well may become the continent's next generation fighter jet. The unnamed fighter could replace current European fighters, including the Eurofighter Typhoon and Boeing F/A-18 Hornet, in the next ten to fifteen years.

Deutsche Welle , citing the German business daily Handelsblatt, said that Airbus was working on some components for the yet-unnamed jet. The article also said Airbus hopes to convince France, home of French fighter manufacturer Dassault, to join the program.

Airbus' fighter would replace current Eurofighter Typhoon jets flown by the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, and Italy. A large, twin-engine multi-role fighter, the Typhoon is extremely maneuverable and has a powerful engine. One drawback however is that the Typhoon was originally designed in the 1980s, before stealth became a key requirement for combat aircraft, and has only marginal radar-evading capabilities. The proposed fighter would also likely replace Spanish F/A-18 Hornet fighters and if France joins the project, Dassault's Rafale fighter.

What would the Airbus fighter look like? It would almost certainly look like a stealthy Eurofighter in both performance and mission. It would be a high-end, high performance fighter with two engines and optimized for air-to-air combat. It would have a powerful, long range radar and beyond visual range missiles such as the UK's Meteor missile . Like the Eurofighter, it would have a secondary air-to-ground mission. It would probably be capable of commanding a robotic wingman or a swarm of drones.

When could it enter service? Fighter planes take a long time to develop—the Typhoon took nearly two decades to go from the drawing board to first flight, and the F-35 slightly less. Both were developed in peacetime without an aggressive major power (like Russia) making trouble in the neighborhood. The newest Royal Air Force Typhoons are scheduled to be retired in 2040 , but other operators, especially Spain and its aging Hornets, would need the new plane sooner. The longer the Airbus fighter takes, the more likely its sales will be eaten up by the F-35—three out of four of the Typhoon's operators are already buying the F-35, and even Germany is now considering buying them . The F-35 would not be an ideal fit, but it would be the only fighter around.

Getting Dassault to join the project will probably be the most challenging part of the project. The French aircraft manufacturer and maker of the Rafale fighter jet is a symbol of France's high tech prowess and military independence. Dassault, as an independent aircraft manufacturer, also gets all of the profits from Rafale sales—a 2015 sale of 24 jets to Egypt was worth $230 million per plane. On the other hand, the Rafale's high cost has limited the number of jets France could buy for itself."
Delta's first Airbus A350 rolls out of the paint shop - USA TODAY,"Tue, 13 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmF2ZWwvZmxpZ2h0cy90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTcvMDYvMTQvZGVsdGFzLWZpcnN0LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXJvbGxzLW91dC1wYWludC1zaG9wLzEwMjgzODI3NC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Delta's first Airbus A350 rolls out of the paint shop

Delta Air Lines will be the first U.S. carrier to fly Airbus’ new A350 widebody jet. Now, aviation enthusiasts are now getting their first look at what the aircraft looks like in the carrier’s colors.

That comes after Delta’s first A350 rolled out of the paint shop at Airbus’ assembly line in Toulouse, France, on Tuesday.

The A350, which Delta says will become its “flagship international aircraft,” is expected to begin flying for the airline later this year. Delta says the A350 will be deployed on its international routes across the Pacific, though carriers typically first ""break in"" new plane types on shorter domestic routes to help familiarize flight and ground crews with the aircraft.

Wherever the A350 begins flying for Delta, the airline will configure the jet with 306 seats. That includes 32 “Delta One” business-class “suites” and 48 “Delta Premium Select Seats” – the carrier’s new international-style premium economy seating. There will be 226 seats in the economy cabin.

Now that Delta’s first A350 is out of the paint shop, it will undergo additional flight testing in France before eventually being handed over to Delta.

Delta says the new A350s will replace its older Boeing 747-400 aircraft, which are slated to be retired at the end of the year.

Delta has 25 Airbus A350s on order with Airbus. Beyond the A350, Delta also has another large widebody in with the European jetmaker; the first of 25 Airbus A330-900neo aircraft are expected to begin arriving to the carrier in 2019 as part of a broader international widebody fleet renewal at the Atlanta-based airline.

Airbus and Boeing wheeled out the usual round of order announcements at the Paris Air Show on Wednesday, but alongside the big ticket purchases, the aerospace rivals are also eyeing the lucrative maintenance and servicing market as they seek to boost growth.

Boeing finalised an order for three 787 Dreamliners to Israeli carrier El Al and inked a memorandum of understanding with leasing company Air Lease Corporation for 12 737 MAXs, while Airbus announced $1.5 billion in orders for Hungarian budget carrier Wizz Air and Portuguese charter airline Hi Fly.

Away from the order books, Airbus and Boeing are targeting the service and maintenance market as a means of boosting business, with the global fleet of planes on course to double by 2036.

Boeing values global demand for aerospace services at $2.6 trillion over the next 10 years. Europe and North America are expected to remain the biggest markets, but the fastest growth is set to come in Asia, where demand for new planes is booming.

The US giant predicts the global aviation support market—which includes maintenance, engineering, training and information services and analytics—will be worth some $8.5 trillion between 2017 and 2036.

These services go alongside the massive growth in global air traffic and demand for new aircraft—Boeing estimates more than 41,000 planes will be needed in the next 20 years for an estimated $6.05 trillion.

Data-driven flight

Boeing said its customers are increasingly using technology and data to improve their business decision-making and passengers' travel experience.

""It is clear that our customers, in both commercial and government sectors, are searching for more efficient ways to keep their fleets operating and ready for use in an age of rapid technological advancement,"" Stan Deal, president and CEO of Boeing Global services, said in a statement.

""As commercial airline fleets continue to grow worldwide, demand for after-market services designed to increase efficiency and extend the economic lives of airplanes will follow.""

Boeing, which achieved a turnover of $95 billion in 2016, announced the creation of a dedicated services division late last year, due to start operations on July 1.

It has a 50 percent share of the civil and military aviation market, but only seven to nine percent in services.

Airbus estimates the services market will be worth $3.2 trillion over the next 20 years, including $1.85 trillion for maintenance alone.

The European giant also announced plans to install new floating black box flight data recorders on its long-haul planes from 2019.

Each plane will be equipped with two recorders, one fixed in the forward part of the aircraft and a second in the tail which could detach and float on the surface if the plane crashes in the sea.

This would help avoid a repeat of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March 2014 with 239 people on board and has never been found, despite a huge search in the Indian Ocean.

The biennial Paris Air Show is one of the biggest events on this year's calendar of aviation events.

The Paris show, which alternates each year with a sister show in Farnborough near London, is one of the largest aviation and defense industry events on the planet. The event is a must for aircraft-makers and other industry firms wishing to show off their latest planes and products.

Fittingly for such an event, the Paris Air Show also serves as a stage for major industry news announcements. Boeing and Airbus, the world's two biggest jetmakers, routinely take advantage of the show's stage to trumpet blockbuster orders for new plans. Smaller makers also use the event to try to promote awareness for their models.

Boeing: 747's future as a passenger aircraft is bleak

Boeing is finally acknowledging its famed 747 likely has little future left as a commercial passenger jet.

The U.S. jetmaker on Tuesday unveiled its annual market forecast that projects aircraft sales over the next 20 years. For the first time, Boeing’s forecast no longer includes a category for “very large” aircraft -- i.e., the 747. Instead, Boeing is now lumping the segment in with its category for “medium and large” widebody planes that includes the strong-selling 777.

“We don’t see much demand for really big aircraft going forward,’’ Randy Tinseth, Boeing’s vice president for marketing, said to Bloomberg News ahead of the Paris Air Show.

Airbus ponders lowering production rate on A380 - Leeham News and Analysis,"Mon, 05 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNy8wNi8wNS9haXJidXMtcG9uZGVycy1sb3dlcmluZy1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLXJhdGUtYTM4MC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"June 5, 2017, © Leeham Co.: Airbus “likely” will decide this year to lower production rates below 1/mo in 2019, officials said today during a press event at the IATA Annual General Meeting in Cancun, Mexico.

They declined to indicate what the “likely” rate will be, despite being pressed several times.

John Leahy, COO-Customers, was making the case to reporters that despite a slowdown in order now experienced by the industry, production rates won’t come down.

Due to record backlogs at Airbus, “and Boeing is not that far behind us, we are increasing production,” Leahy said. “We’re moving up to rate 60 [per month] on the single aisle. I’d like to see the rate even higher.

“We’ll be at rate 10 on the A350 we’re stabilizing at rate six on the A330 and we’re looking at the A380 and how to break even at about less than one airplane a month. That’s a unique situation, as you’ll see for a unique airplane.”

Reporters jumped on the news.

Decision needed this year

“Yes, it’s likely we may have to go below rate one,” said Didier Evrard, EVP Programmes. “We will continue to study possibilities to go below rate one while keeping the program [at break even] on the financial side.”

Airbus needs orders this year to maintain rate one, the company said., although Leahy said accelerating orders from future years into 2019 could maintain rate one.

“There are various things that can be done, but the important point is to get the airplane to at least break even at a lower production rate to get through a period of softness in the market for large airplanes so that we are there for the airplane in the next decade,” Leahy said. “We think it’s going to be very strong.”

Leahy declined to say what the lower rates are Airbus is studying.

“I’m looking to maintain the rate [1/mo], he said. “Didier is trying to protect if we have to go below that. We don’t lose money on the program.”

Airbus Helicopters unveils new compound demonstrator - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLXVudmVpbHMtbmV3LWNvbXBvdW5kLWRlbW9uc3RyYXRvci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters has unveiled a downscaled mockup of a new compound helicopter demonstrator as part of the Clean Sky 2 public-private research program, which is slated to fly in 2020.

Known as the Racer (an acronym for Rapid And Cost-Efficient Rotorcraft), the demonstrator is on display at the Paris Air Show. And, while it clearly takes inspiration from Airbus’s earlier X3 compound aircraft, the Racer is essentially a cleansheet design. When Airbus built the X3 in 2010, it reused a lot of existing components and subassemblies, such as a Dauphin fuselage. This time, most components are optimized for use in the Racer.

Airbus is targeting a slightly slower cruise speed than the X3’s 220 knots optimum. At 190 knots, it is estimated the Racer will need less power than a conventional, similar-weight helicopter flying at 140 knots.

This is achieved through the use of wings, which provide part of the lift, helping to alleviate the main rotor’s load. As the rotation speed is reduced, blade tip speed is no longer a problem, and the main rotor needs less power. Moreover, the mast sustains less bending strain. This is thanks to the side-mounted propellers — so the rotor no longer has to be pitched forward for the aircraft to gather speed. So, from both an aerodynamic and a mechanical standpoint, it is easier for such a design to fly at high speeds.

The X3 was flight-tested from 2010 to 2014. Lutz Bertling, then-CEO of what was then known as Eurocopter, was enthusiastic about the program, but his successor, Guillaume Faury, has had a more conservative approach about research and development spending. The X3 demonstration program was never used as a basis for a product. Nonetheless, it seems Clean Sky 2 has renewed interest for the idea.

The Racer will feature an optimized architecture, Tomasz Krysinski, head of research and innovation at Airbus Helicopters, told Vertical. The box wing brings a number of benefits. The upper wing has a masking effect over the lower wing and the downwash therefore “sees” a smaller surface. For an equivalent hover performance, the main rotor may produce less thrust.

The main landing gear can be installed in the lower wing, and wheels can thus be located further apart. This gives more stability and makes retraction and extension mechanisms simple.

The box wing is also stiffer than a conventional one, so the transmission shafts therefore deform less. In turn, they can be made lighter. Both steel and carbon-fiber shafts will be evaluated, according to Krysinski.

The Racer’s propellers, in a pusher configuration, are far from passenger doors. Moreover, downstream from the wing, the airflow is more favorable to a propeller’s aerodynamics, and cuts its power need by 10 percent, Krysinski said.

A pair of Safran Helicopter Engines RTM322 turboshafts, in service on military helicopters like the NH90, will drive the rotor and propellers. A noteworthy feature will be a small but spectacular level of hybridization; in cruise flight, it is more efficient to use one engine at high power than two at medium power, so thanks to an innovative “stop and start” electric system, one turboshaft will be shut down or idled in cruise flight. The system will be able to restart the engine very quickly, if needed.

Final assembly of the Racer is planned for 2019, with flight trials scheduled for the 2020 to 2022 period, which could be extended. The goal of the demonstration is to bring the compound concept to technology readiness level 6, meaning it will be ready for a full program launch.

Airbus Helicopters has a number of European partners, as is required in such a project. Aernnova, a Spanish specialist of composite materials, will supply the aft fuselage., while Avio, an Italian company that is part of U.S.-based GE, will collaborate on the gearboxes’ design.

The total cost of the program is €200 million ($220 million). Large companies — like Airbus Helicopters — see a maximum 40 percent of their share of the cost funded by the Clean Sky 2 program. Smaller partners receive up to 60 percent funding."
Airbus first to commit to commercial Vega C launch - SpaceNews,"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXJidXMtZmlyc3QtdG8tY29tbWl0LXRvLWNvbW1lcmNpYWwtdmVnYS1jLWxhdW5jaC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Airbus has signed up to be the first commercial customer to use Europe’s future Vega C rocket, ordering two launchers to orbit a four-satellite Earth-observation constellation.

Arianespace, the Evry, France-based company responsible for marketing the existing Ariane 5, Soyuz and Vega rockets, as well as the future Vega C and Ariane 6, announced June 20 that the Airbus missions would take place in mid-2020.

The Airbus mission does not constitute Vega C’s first flight, which is scheduled for 2019.

Vega C is an upgraded version of the current Vega rocket from Italian manufacturer Avio, capable of launching about 50 percent more mass to a 700-kilometer polar orbit.

“We fully trust Arianespace to orbit our new constellation, which will bolster our service offering and expand our range of services,” François Lombard, head of Airbus Defence and Space’s Intelligence Business Cluster, said in a June 20 statement.

Airbus revealed in September that it was self-financing a constellation of four sub-meter resolution Earth-observation satellites to succeed the two Pleiades satellites currently in orbit. Those satellites will be able to revisit sites for observation several times a day.

Meanwhile, Avio recently completed the carbon-fiber casing for the P120C solid rocket motor it is developing to serve as the first stage of Vega C and as a strap-on booster for Ariane 6. Avio CEO Giulio Ranzo told SpaceNews by email June 19 that the company tested the empty case at its new plant in Colleferro near Rome last week. The case will be shipped in July to French Guiana where it will be cast with inactive propellant in September.

“The second case will be produce shortly and this one will be cast with real propellant and test fired in March 2018,” he said."

MEDINA, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Darkside Scientific, creators of LumiLor Light Emitting Coating, is working with European aircraft manufacturer Airbus to create electroluminescent exterior markings for aircraft. The announcement was made today.

LumiLor is the world’s first and only patented electroluminescent paint. The product allows manufacturers to design with light in ways previously impossible. It produces a single-color light that is visible at long distances and shines through many types of atmospheric conditions such as fog, snow and smoke.

Airbus Innovation leaders say they’re impressed with the technology behind LumiLor and see promising possibilities for the future.

“This is an exciting new product that can turn surfaces into functional elements in an unconventional way,” said Vincent Loubiere, lead technologist at Airbus. “Darkside Scientific has the spirit we look for in our partners — dedication, reactivity, rapidity in developing and testing concrete solutions.”

Unlike many light sources such as LEDs, the brightness of LumiLor is distributed across the coating and appears the same from all angles of view. Simply put, anything you paint with LumiLor can be turned on and off as easy as a light bulb.

Researchers at Darkside Scientific have perfected the formula to withstand the harsh elements of jet travel, company leaders say.

“LumiLor has met the standards needed to be flown on the outside of commercial aircraft,” said Shawn Mastrian, chief executive officer at Darkside Scientific. “This creates new opportunities for Airbus to identify, promote, and differentiate its aircraft for its customers.”

Beyond the aerospace industry, LumiLor is being used successfully in a variety of industries including automotive, architecture, transportation and emergency lighting.

Family Flight: Behind the scenes - Airbus,"Sat, 17 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE3LTA2LWZhbWlseS1mbGlnaHQtYmVoaW5kLXRoZS1zY2VuZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A united formation and an aeronautical achievement

Behind the scenes of Airbus’ latest video, which sees our A350 XWB, A400M, Eurofighter Typhoon and H160 aircraft sharing the skies in a one-off performance.

“Different aircraft, completely different performance and flight characteristics, the diversity of our portfolio – and we were able to bring this,” says Ignacio Lombo, Airbus DS Chief Test Pilot, highlighting the challenges behind creating the Family Flight video.

To film the different formations that have already been viewed over 5 million times on Airbus social media, flight crews for all 4 aircraft met with photographer Anthony Pecchi and his team at Istres in southern France.

Factors such as positioning, manoeuvrability, speed and fuel were mapped out with complete accuracy, as the crews got to grips with the task: “You have to really prepare the flights very carefully to make sure it’s safe. You have to think what is feasible, and how to go from one shot to another,” explains Christophe Cail, Airbus Chief Test Pilot.

More than ever, we make it fly

The teams and aircraft gathered from sites across Europe, with the Eurofighter performing its sequences in a more limited timescale and the A400M completing tests on its journey back to Seville. “We feel very proud of our company, our personnel and our products because it’s really impressive what we are able to achieve when working together,” underlines Carlos Pinilla, Local Chief Pilot at Getafe, where the Eurofighter returned after filming.

And it was also a chance for Airbus’ network of flight test experts – who really do make it fly – to come together. Summing up the mood, Olivier Gensse, Experimental Test Pilot at Airbus Helicopters, adds: “It’s just outstanding to be in the middle of such different aircraft and to share a flight with all the Airbus crews. With this flight, you can say we are a family.”

"Sales of 4-engine jumbo jets fading out at Boeing, Airbus | Arkansas Democrat Gazette - Arkansas Online","Sun, 25 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMTcvanVuLzI1L3NhbGVzLW9mLTQtZW5naW5lLWp1bWJvLWpldHMtZmFkaW5nLW91dC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing sees the future, and it doesn't include jumbo passenger jets. Not its own iconic 747. Not the Airbus A380.

The U.S. planemaker has dropped the category reserved for four-engine behemoths from its annual forecast for the commercial-aircraft market. Instead, Boeing predicts that airlines will use more efficient twin-engine jets for long-range flights -- like its 787 Dreamliner and 777X, or a midmarket plane that's on the drawing board.

By leaving so-called very large aircraft off its two-decade projection for a $6.05 trillion jetliner market, Boeing said it was reflecting a market reality: There is little to no chance of reviving sales of those models. The Chicago-based company and Airbus already had pared production of their biggest aircraft as orders dwindled, and Boeing has warned it may stop making the 747's passenger version.

""We don't see much demand for really big aircraft going forward,"" Randy Tinseth, Boeing's vice president for marketing, said at a briefing ahead of the Paris Air Show last week. ""We find it hard to believe that Airbus will deliver the rest of their A380s in backlog.""

Airbus still sees a long-term market for the planes although it didn't log a single A380 sale last year. The Toulouse, France-based manufacturer says airlines will need larger jets as passenger traffic doubles and congestion limits the number of flights into megahubs, particularly in Asia and the Middle East.

The European company projects potential industrywide sales of 1,400 of the largest commercial aircraft, valued at $454 billion through 2037. That compares with Boeing's 20-year forecast for 80 deliveries that Tinseth outlined last week at a Paris show presentation.

As the jumbo era ends at Boeing, the planemaker sees a new market emerging for midrange airplanes overlapping the largest single-aisle and smallest twin-aisle jets. That differs from the stance at Airbus, which announced plans at the Paris show to make enhancements to the A380 in the hopes of one day reviving orders.

""They went big and heavy, we went small and efficient,"" said Mike Delaney, Boeing vice president and general manager for airplane development. ""We'll overfly our competitors, put a lighter gauge on things.""

Airbus is refining the double-decker A380's design, including adding 15-foot winglets, to boost fuel efficiency by as much as 4 percent. Tinseth dismissed the strategy. ""Putting winglets on an airplane that's too big doesn't make that airplane any smaller,"" he said.

The mid-range model Boeing is developing would seat between 220 and 270 travelers and fly about 5,000 nautical miles. The goal is to spur growth with jetliners that avoid hubs and link smaller cities on routes that aren't properly matched to today's aircraft. Think Washington to Prague, Japan to India, or within China's ""Golden Triangle"" of Shanghai, Guangzhou and Beijing.

Airlines also could use the new jet -- dubbed the 797 or NMA, for new mid-market airplane -- on transcontinental flights to replace aging Boeing 757 and 767 jets. Budget carriers could graduate from single-aisle jets to the larger planes for more-popular routes.

Tinseth projects a potential market of 4,000 to 5,000 sales in that segment over 20 years.

Airbus has already made advances in that market with its largest single-aisle plane, the A321neo, and is exploring a stretched version that would carry more than 240 passengers. While that narrow-body would probably be cheaper than the new Boeing dual-aisle, the U.S. company sees a competitive advantage in a design that lets people board and disembark far more quickly.

Single-aisle aircraft like the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 will still rule the market, accounting for nearly three-quarters of total sales, according to Boeing's forecast. The planemaker predicts a need for 29,530 narrow-bodies valued at $3.18 trillion through 2036.

The next most popular type will be small wide-body aircraft, like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A330, accounting for 5,050 deliveries or 12 percent of forecast sales, Boeing predicts.

Sales of very large aircraft will probably be confined to Boeing's niche-market 747-8 freighter and a handful of jets for VIPs, like the next Air Force One for the U.S. president.

The hump-backed 747 -- which in 1970 ushered in a new era of mass long-range travel -- eventually will be replaced at the top of the jetliner food chain by Boeing's 777X. The first delivery for that 400-seat plane is scheduled for 2020.

""The biggest airplane in the market moving forward is going to be the 777X,"" Tinseth said.

"Airbus' A320 Airspace cabin grows bins, modernises cabin - Runway Girl Network","Mon, 19 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTcvMDYvYWlyYnVzLWEzMjAtYWlyc3BhY2UtY2FiaW4tZ3Jvd3MtYmlucy1tb2Rlcm5pc2VzLWNhYmluL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LE BOURGET — Despite a wider fuselage and seats, Airbus has lagged Boeing’s 737 passenger experience in style — and more importantly in overhead bin space — since the Boeing Sky Interior débuted in 2010. By 2020, Airbus is aiming to change that, with a phased introduction of what it’s calling the A320 Airspace cabin, available for both linefit and retrofit of A320ceo and neo family aircraft.

To start, in 2019 massive new bins — capable of holding massive 24” x 16” x 10” bags on their ends — will be available, followed by a series of largely more cosmetic #PaxEx upgrades in 2020, including an extra inch of sidewall sculpting, a new welcome area and an aesthetic familiar from the widebody Airspace programmes.

The bins are clearly the most vital part of the Airspace upgrade. Retrofits to add pivot bins to A320 family aircraft have been available for the best part of half a decade, with Zodiac’s ECOS (formerly ISIS, name changed for obvious reasons) being the best-known example. Going against the industry grain, though, Airbus has selected flip-up bins rather than a swinging pivot version. The airframer’s Ingo Wuggetzer tells Runway Girl Network that Airbus’ flip-up bins are lighter, less complex and easier for flight attendants to lift.

Airbus is cognisant — thanks to its work with a couple of dozen airlines — that some airlines have cabin crew whose average stature is not sufficient to reach the top of the flip-down bin without a step on the aisle side of the seat frame or a lid assist mechanism, and it is exploring options for how to best work around this issue.

Thoroughly pleasingly, the opened bin lids fit neatly into the structure of the cabin ceiling, making the aircraft more attractive on boarding with the addition of sculpted support structures and carefully designed mechanisms. Airbus also suggests that the lack of pivot bins at a lower level may speed up boarding and improve the sense of space.

Also improving a sense of space: an extra inch at head and shoulder level thanks to some advanced sidewall sculpting, and a new doors 1 welcome zone that echoes the curved signature Airspace look from the A330neo and A350.

Less convincing: the “modular IFE platform” and “flexible connectivity” that were touted, which neither vice president of cabin marketing Ingo Wuggetzer nor senior vice president of marketing François Caudron could materially distinguish from the options currently available to airlines, with the most innovative part being the coincidence that modular IFE like Panasonic’s NEXT will likely be available at roughly the same time as the A320 Airspace cabin.

It seems clear that the A320 Airspace cabin will eventually be the future standard for the interiors of the Airbus narrowbody line. But the crux for the airframer, lessors and airlines will be how the switchover from the current interior — which is approximately a decade old — to Airspace is managed, given that the bins will be available first and many airlines will not wish to take every item on the Airspace list.

From 2020, Airbus intends to offer the A320 Airspace package as a whole to airlines purchasing linefit — in theory, there will be no picking and choosing, although one would expect that a significant enough order would enable a customer to be choosier. That package model would seem to be more attractive to lessors, though the extra pricing for the Airspace cabin is unlikely to be.

For a period of time, it is conceivable that “an Airspace cabin” may be different between airlines and between refit, non-refit, or tranches of refit aircraft, which will be a challenge to the Airspace brand.

If Airbus can manage that, however — perhaps through only branding as Airspace those cabins with the Full Monty of options — it would seem to be on to a winner.

Aircraft to be delivered in 2018

Paris, France, 20 June 2017 – The French Gendarmerie Nationale is replacing its trust in Airbus Helicopters’ EC145 with the purchase of an additional aircraft to be delivered in 2018. The aircraft will be delivered in the same configuration as the existing Gendarmerie fleet, with mission equipment notably including a hoist, search light, sling, and specific radios. Fourteen EC145s are currently being operated by the Gendarmerie Nationale for their critical law enforcement and public services missions.

“The EC145 is an important asset to the Gendarmerie Nationale” said Colonel Emmanuel Sillon, head of the Gendarmerie Nationale Air Forces. “Thanks to the global service solution provided by Airbus Helicopters, our fleet has reached 80% percent availability rate which allows us to ensure our missions 24/7 in the most challenging conditions”, he added.

“We are pleased that the Gendarmerie Nationale has renewed its trust in the EC145 and that our global service solution has been contributing, since the end of 2015, to the performance of the of highly valuable and critical missions performed by our customer’s EC145 fleet” said Alexandra Cros, head of Sales for France at Airbus Helicopters.

The EC145, a medium-sized, twin-engine helicopter, incorporates Airbus Helicopters' advanced cockpit design, avionics and a sophisticated electrical system. The aircraft is a member of the H145 family, which today has logged more than 4.3 million flight hours with its fleet of around 1,250 aircraft worldwide.

"Racer, a New Airbus Helicopter, Will Cruise at 250 Mph When It Flies in 2020 - Popular Mechanics","Wed, 21 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHVsYXJtZWNoYW5pY3MuY29tL2ZsaWdodC9uZXdzL2EyNzAxNy9uZXctYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXItcmFjZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Say hello to Airbus's new Racer craft, unveiled at the 2017 Paris Air Show.

The Racer, or Rapid And Cost-Effective Rotorcraft, can hit a cruising speed around 250 mph thanks to what Airbus calls an innovative, new ""box-wing"" design. A typical helicopter currently flies around 160 mph. The Racer's box-wing design, coupled with a light hybrid metallic-composite airframe, provides extra lift. Pusher propellers will increase speed while the helo is moving forward.

Airbus focused its design strategy in two places: increasing speed while keeping the sound down. To that end, its lateral rotors will be powered by two RTM 322 engines from the French company Safran. These are military-grade engines that Airbus previously used in its X3 demonstrator. The X3, Airbus says in a press release, ""validated the 'compound' aerodynamic configuration – a combination of a traditional main rotor and innovative lateral rotors,"" which the Racer will duplicate.

The French aerial giant also plans to add an ""eco mode"" mode to the craft, showing the possibility of electrically powered ""start and stop"" mechanics in an aircraft engine to save fuel and increase range (by running just one of the two engines at times). ""It will pave the way for new time-sensitive services for 2030 and beyond, setting new benchmarks for high-speed helicopter transportation,"" says Guillaume Faury, Airbus Helicopters CEO, in a press statement.

The company hopes to spend 2019 building Racers and have them in the air by 2020.

Airbus confirms A380plus study - Leeham News and Analysis,"Sun, 18 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNy8wNi8xOC9haXJidXMtY29uZmlybXMtYTM4MHBsdXMtc3R1ZHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"June 18, 2017, © Leeham Co.: Airbus today confirmed what’s been reported for the better part of two weeks: it’s studying aerodynamic and other improvements to the A380 to make it more attractive to airlines.

LNC first detailed the prospect of a new winglet and interior improvements June 12.

Airbus calls the study for an enhanced airplane the A380plus. With the aerodynamic changes, the most notable of which is the 4.7 meter high winglet, plus more seating, Airbus projects a 13% economic improvement.

New uplet and downlet

“The study includes aerodynamic improvements, in particular new, large winglets and other wing

refinements, that allow for up to 4% fuel burn savings,” Airbus said. “Added to an optimised A380 maintenance programme and the enhanced cabin features first shown at Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX) in April, the overall benefit is a 13% cost per seat reduction versus today’s A380.”

The winglets are split into a 3.5m “uplet” and a 1.2m “downlet.”

Airbus has figured out how to add 80 more seats to the cabin configuration.

“The A380plus features longer maintenance check intervals, a reduced six-year check downtime, and systems improvements, which will reduce maintenance costs and increase aircraft availability,” Airbus said.

Airbus augments A350-1000 capability - Leeham News and Analysis,"Tue, 27 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNy8wNi8yNy9haXJidXMtYXVnbWVudHMtYTM1MC0xMDAwLWNhcGFiaWxpdHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"June 27, 2017, © Leeham Co.: Airbus has quietly announced it will augment the payload and range capability of the Airbus A350-1000 when certified. The latest Aircraft Characteristics for Airport and Maintenance Planning guide (ACAP) for A350 increases the aircraft’s maximum weight before fuel is loaded and its maximum take-off weight.

At the same time, the A350-900ULR variant’s maximum take-off weight is now available as a standard weight variant (no 10).

Improvements for A350-1000

During the certification tests of a new aircraft, it’s verified if an aircraft can fly with a higher load than originally planned. Static and fatigue strength tests reveal if the aircraft structure has margins. Flight tests (especially the spectacular Vmu test, the one where the tail is scraped in the runway to test minimum lift-off speed) show if the planned flight characteristics are present.

For most of these tests, the aircraft is designed with a margin. When these margins are not consumed by reality, the performance data for the aircraft can be improved. One of the most performance affecting areas are the aircraft weights.

When weights can be increased without compromises in airfield performance, the payload or range of the aircraft improves. Range is dictated by how much fuel can be filled, once the aircraft is filled with passenger and cargo (the payload).

For a given empty weight and payload, a higher Max Take-Off Weight (MTOW) will increase available fuel and therefore range. The weight increase for -1000 goes from the planned 308t for Weight Variant 1 (WV001) to 311t for WV002 and finally 316t for WV003. A 3t tonnes weight increase for fuel means 150nm additional range; the 8t gives 450nm.

The weight variants also offer a higher Zero Fuel Weight. This means more payload can be loaded before the rest of the weight has to be fuel (fuel goes in the wings and doesn’t stress the aircraft as much as weight entered in the fuselage). Both WV002 and WV003 allow an additional 3t of payload before fuel. This means another 30 passengers can be loaded (if there are seats for them) or another 3t of cargo on shorter routes (below 5,500nm for a nominal aircraft).

ULR weights now available for standard A350-900

The latest guide also shows the special MTOW of the A350-900ULR of 280t as a standard weight variant, WV010. This means the standard A350-900 can be flown an additional 800nm over the range of the standard 268t version (WV000). The additional payload that can be loaded in this variant is 3.7t (MZFW 195.7t instead of 192t).

Experience the first public flying appearance of the A321neo and A350-1000;

Journey into the future in 3D at the Airbus Digital Exhibition centre;

Virtually fly an A400M or interactively explore an “Airspace” cabin in 3D.

At the Paris Air Show, which runs from 19th to 25th June 2017, Airbus will showcase its wide range of innovative technologies, products and services, from market-leading commercial and military aircraft to helicopters and space systems. In addition, there will be a new Digital Exhibition zone at the Airbus pavilion (located at the end of Chalet Row A), where traditional mock-ups give way to the latest digital immersive and interactive display technologies to convey an improved experience of Airbus’ products and services, in life-like virtual reality scenarios.In the static display areas, visitors will see a plethora of Airbus’ real operational and development aircraft. Notably, this year’s show will mark the first time that Airbus publicly showcases in a flying display the A321neo (now entering airline service) and also the latest member of the A350 XWB family – the A350-1000 – which is currently well into its certification flight-testing phase. The A380 will also feature in both the static and flying displays.Meanwhile Airbus Defence and Space’s exhibits will include the A400M, the C295 and the Eurofighter Typhoon. At the other end of the size scale, but every bit as cutting-edge, will be a collection of unmanned air systems including the “Harfang”, the DVF 2000 VT Aliaca, the DVF 2000 ER Arrano, and the Quadcruiser. In the space perimeter will be a comprehensive portfolio of satellites, highlighting recent successes such as the first all-electric satellite in the three-tonne class, EUTELSAT 172B, or PerúSAT-1, which was delivered in only 24 months and hence set a new benchmark in terms of delivery time. Guests to the Airbus pavilion will also have the opportunity to experience a virtual reality visit to the International Space Station ISS, and see how with ‘Space Tug’, Airbus is getting ready to revolutionise the space business through ‘on-orbit’ services.Airbus Helicopters’ line-up on the static display includes the H130, the H135 equipped with the Helionix digital avionics suit, the H145M fitted out with HForce and a Tiger helicopter from the French army which will also perform flight demos during the show. Show-goers will be able to discover at first-hand Airbus Helicopters’ innovative solutions for preparing the future of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) with a mock-up of its new high-speed demonstrator at the Clean Sky booth. The future of unmanned flight is a key element in development with, on the military side, the VSR700 mock-up on the static display, and on the civil side a mock-up of CityAirbus, the “urban air mobility” solution for congested cities, at the Paris Air Lab booth.As well as exploring all this latest hardware ‘up close’, or from afar as they perform their impressive air displays, visitors to our new “Digital Exhibition” concept area will be able to interactively immerse themselves in the fine details of every facet in Airbus’ group-wide activities – spanning not only Commercial Aircraft, Defence and Space, Helicopters, Services, but also other areas such as future research, the extended innovation ecosystem, electrification, “urban air mobility”, the Airbus Foundation as well as strengths in our workforce diversity. Moreover, with special VR headsets, guests will be able to fly-through the International Space Station, experience a H175 helicopter search-and-rescue mission, sit inside the cockpit of an A400M as it takes off from rough terrain, or explore the latest “Airspace” cabin interior innovations. In addition to hosting these immersive VR scenarios, the Exhibition will also feature a unique “HoloLens” zone which projects dynamic 3D holographic models – such as the ‘ExoMars’ Rover traversing a Martian landscape.Airbus, which plans to recruit nearly 3,000 people in 2017, will be present throughout the week at the “” and “” areas dedicated to careers, training and employment in the aerospace industry. Airbus will also demonstrate its commitment to diversity and inclusion in the industry through meetings and conferences. In addition, the company will formalise several partnerships with research centres, schools and universities to ensure that in the coming years, industrial and academic requirements converge, and provide the skills which it needs to continuously innovate."

Unlike airplanes, whirlybirds can take off and land almost anywhere, making them just the thing for tight spots and urban areas. The drawback, though, is speed. Choppers are slow.

While Gulfstream's G650 private jet streaks along at north of 600 mph, conventional choppers like the police or your local traffic reporter might use maxes out around 160 mph. Quick, but not that quick when talking about flight. Airbus thinks it found a way of closing the speed gap without sacrificing a helicopter's inherent advantages: add wings and props to create an aircraft that can take off and land vertically, hover, and cruise at a heady 250 mph. Airbus calls it the Racer, for Rapid and Cost-Effective Rotorcraft.

You just know it came up with the name first, then found the words to make it work.

Airbus

The idea is to find a way around the physics that limit the speed of a conventional helo. With any helicopter, the top rotor provides lift as the blades slice the air. When the helicopter is flying forward, air moves around the the blade spinning in the direction of travel faster than it does around the retreating blade on the opposite side, causing something aerodynamicists call dissymmetry of lift. The faster you go, the more severe the effect and the less stable the helicopter. Aerodynamicists know how to compensate for most of that, but the challenge mounts as the blades approach the speed of sound. An advancing blade hitting the sound barrier creates aerodynamic instabilities engineers cannot compensate for."

Drag-reducing 'scimitar' split wingtips have been used on Boeing's medium-haul Boeing 737 MAX, but never on a jetliner the size of the A380, which has a 79.9-metre (262-foot) wingspan.

The aircraft sporting the prototype 'winglet' will be towed out to join others on display at the June 19-25 air show, giving airlines a glimpse of an improvement that Airbus hopes will turn around weak sales of its flagship double-decker.

However, a new clash is looming with rival Boeing over the future for such four-engined passenger aircraft, which have seen production fall and which also include the Boeing 747-8.

Boeing looks set to revise down or even scrap its 20-year forecast for such 'very large aircraft' in a survey next week.

""The very big airplane market for the last 10-15 years has been moving downward and downward,"" Marketing Vice President Randy Tinseth told the Paris Air Forum on Friday.

""That very big end of the market, maybe one percent, is going to be very, very small,"" he said, adding that the 555-seat A380 would have to be made longer to become economic and that there was little market for such a large plane.

Eric Schulz, president of civil aerospace at Rolls-Royce , whose engines are offered on the A380, told the same conference travel congestion underpinned demand for big jumbos.

""I am convinced that without a massive and significant improvement in airport installations and air traffic control routes, there will be still a lot of congested routes and if anything the city pairs will grow for bigger airplanes"".

But he said questions remain over to what extent that demand would be met by four-engined jets like the A380 or big twinjets closer to 400 seats, like the Boeing 777-9 and Airbus A350-1000.

Airbus last week revised down its forecast for the A380 category by six percent to 1,184 aircraft, though at four percent of total deliveries this remains more optimistic than Boeing.

But in Paris the star performer is likely to be the F-35 fighter jet.

The Paris Air Show is once again the setting for a fierce battle between bitter rivals Boeing and Airbus to win aircraft orders from airlines. The US and European aviation giants invariable seek to outdo each other by announcing big deals at the show.

The biennial show got underway at Le Bourget near Paris on Monday and runs until June 25. It is expected to draw around 150,000 industry professionals from 2,370 companies.

Read: Russia's MC-21 a challenge to Boeing, Airbus?

The last event in 2015 brought orders for 421 planes worth $57 billion (51 billion euros) for Airbus and orders for 331 planes worth $50 billion (44.6 billion euros) for Boeing.

But many expect the number of new civilian aircraft orders to fall short of the sales the companies managed to clock up during the previous show two years ago.

Rising competition

Airbus and Boeing have seen a downturn in orders in recent years after a buying spree by Mideast and Asian carriers.

This year, each company is expected to announce around 200 orders, though some may only be airlines or leasing companies firming up earlier tentative orders. Yet the industry remains optimistic about sustained long-term growth.

Neither Boeing nor Airbus is unveiling a major new plane at the show.

Nonetheless, most likely to get attention are Boeing's latest 787 model, the 787-10, and Airbus' answer to it, the A350-1000, the latest version of the long-delayed Airbus wide-body plane. Boeing will also show its 737 Max 9 and Airbus will show the single-aisle A321, popular for its fuel efficiency.

Airbus said earlier this month that it expects the market for large passenger planes to more than double in the next 20 years driven by growth from Asian markets.

The planemaker predicts the need for 35,000 new planes worth $5.3 trillion over the next two decades, an increase over last year's estimates.

Competition in the sector is also on the rise, with Chinese and Russian aviation firms test-flying their own mid-range models.

The star of the show

Around 200,000 regular visitors are expected at the Paris Air Show this year, many of whom will come especially for spectacular displays of supersonic military hardware as fast combat planes break the sound barrier.

The star of the show will likely be the cutting-edge F-35 stealth jet fighter. Each one comes with the amazing price tag of about $100 million Image: Reuters/U.S. Air Force photo/Randy Gon

Among the 130 aircraft on display, the star will likely be the cutting-edge F-35 stealth jet fighter, which costs around $100 million each.

Designed to creep up undetected on ground targets and for air-to-air combat, the jet will wow with daily flights - hoping to impress potential foreign customers for manufacturer Lockheed Martin.

Briefings by the plane's chief test pilot and others on the jet's aerial capabilities and the F-35 program could produce news about recent problems that grounded US Air Force F-35s at a base in Arizona, after pilots reported symptoms of oxygen deprivation.

The US Air Force will use the F-35 to replace the A-10 and F-16, and has already taken delivery of more than 100 of the planes.

the airbus ‘racer’ concept demonstrator will be built around a simple architecture, ensuring safety and cost-efficiency. an innovative ‘box-wing’ design, optimized for aerodynamic efficiency, will provide lift in ‘cruise’ mode while isolating passengers during ground operations from the ‘pusher’ lateral rotors, which are designed to generate thrust in forward flight.

‘today we unveil our bold vision for the future of high-speed rotorcraft,’ comments guillaume faury, airbus helicopters CEO, at the paris air show 2017. ‘this new project, pulling together the skills and know-how of dozens of european partners through the clean sky 2 initiative, aims to bring increased speed and range at the right cost, thanks to a simple, safe and proven aerodynamic formula. it will pave the way for new time-sensitive services for 2030 and beyond, setting new benchmarks for high-speed helicopter transportation.’

optimized for performance and low acoustic signature, these lateral rotors as well as the main rotor will be driven by two ‘RTM322’ engines. an ‘eco mode’ will be tested by the engine manufacturer to demonstrate an electrically-powered ‘start and stop’ of one engine in flight, thus generating fuel savings and increasing range. the racer demonstrator will also benefit from a hybrid metallic-composite airframe, specifically designed for low weight and low recurring costs. it will be equipped with a new high voltage direct current electrical generation, which will significantly contribute to weight reduction.

building on the success of the self-funded ‘X3’ demonstrator, which validated the ‘compound’ aerodynamic configuration – a combination of a traditional main rotor and innovative lateral rotors – the racer project will bring this concept closer to an operational design and demonstrate its suitability for a wide spectrum of missions where increased speed and efficiency will bring significant added value for citizens and operators. this is especially the case for emergency medical services and search and rescue operations, as well as for public services, commercial air transport and private and business aviation."

It brings additional benefit especially for law enforcement, para-public or military missions offering the possibility to carry for example more fuel, mission equipment or passengers.

Axel Humpert, Airbus Helicopters head of H145 program, said: “Since the entry-in-service of the new H145 in 2014 Airbus Helicopters has continued its efforts to improve the power and performance of the aircraft according to our customers’ needs. The new alternate gross weight of 3,800 kilograms is a significant increase for a light-twin helicopter and offers real added value for H145 operators.”

The AGW of 3,800 kilograms is linked to a temporary restricted flight envelope until 100 kilograms of fuel are consumed after approximately 20 minutes. It requires a logging of AGW times with a slight impact on direct maintenance costs. The AGW does not apply to Cat. A flights where performance with one engine inoperative is relevant.

The H145 is the most advanced member of Airbus Helicopters’ multi-purpose twin-engine category. The EC145/H145 family combines a total of over four million flight hours and more than 1,100 rotorcraft are in service worldwide."

20-Year Market Outlook for Jetliners: Airbus vs. Boeing - Yahoo Finance,"Mon, 12 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8yMC1tYXJrZXQtb3V0bG9vay1qZXRsaW5lcnMtYWlyYnVzLTIwMDIwODUxNS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The commercial airplane demand is on the rise due to a steady improvement in passenger and freight traffic. The major driver behind the increase in demand can be attributed to growth in the single-aisle airplane segment. In fact, this segmental growth is backed by the global popularity of the low-cost carrier business model and expansion of air service into emerging markets such as Asia, thereby compelling airlines to accelerate the replacement of aged airplanes.



Notably, these single-aisle jets have been the main area of competition between two arch rivals, Airbus Group SE EADSY and The Boeing Co. BA. Currently, these two aerospace behemoths are wooing the market with the updated versions of their popular single-aisle jets – Boeing’s new 737 MAX 10 against Airbus' new A321 neo.



20-Year Market Outlook



Airbus recently raised the 20-year forecast for jetliner demand by 6% based on the growing need for the improvement of fuel-efficient single-aisle airliners. In Jul 2016, its rival Boeing had raised its 20-year forecast for jetliner demand by 4.1%.



Airbus’ New Forecast



Per Airbus’ current outlook, the world will need more than 34,899 new planes, worth $5.3 trillion, between 2017 and 2036. This anticipated number is pegged above last year's projected demand of 33,070 jets, worth $5.2 trillion, for the period of 2016–2035. Of the total units, 40% of the demand will be for the replacement of older, less-efficient aircraft.



Airbus expects single-aisle jets to be the major driver behind demand growth, comprising more than 70% of the total projection. This translates into worldwide demand for 24,810 single-aisle jets, worth $2.4 trillion, in the next 20 years.



As the world’s passenger aircraft fleet above 100 seats will double over the next 20 years, it will require 530,000 new pilots and 550,000 new maintenance engineers. This, in turn, is expected to act as a catalyst for growth of Airbus’ global services business.



Boeing’s Forecast



Boeing forecasted that the world will need 39,620 new planes, worth $5.9 trillion, between 2016 and 2035. Of the total units, 43% of the demand will be for the replacement of older, less-efficient aircraft.



The company added that it expects single-aisle jets to be the major driver behind demand growth, comprising 71% of the total projection. This translates into worldwide demand for 28,140 single-aisle jets, worth $3 trillion, in the next 20 years.



Other Categories



Trailing behind single-aisle jetliners are their large wide-body, twin-aisle counterparts. For this category, Airbus projects demand for 10,100 new planes in the 2017–2036 period. Even though the figure appears unimpressive, the price of these planes is enough to compensate for the difference in volume. The company estimates that the total value of all wide-body planes (comprising small, medium or large) sold over the period to be $2.9 trillion compared with $2.4 trillion for the narrow-body variety.



In contrast, Boeing projected demand for 9,100 new planes in the 2016–2035 period valued at $2.82 trillion. Meanwhile, regional jets were expected to account for $110 billion in global sales.



Air and Passenger Traffic Forecast



Airbus lowered its projection for air traffic growth to 4.4% a year from 4.5% as it took a more cautious view on mature markets such as North America. We note that air traffic growth is highest in emerging markets such as China, India, the rest of Asia and Latin America.



Over the next 20 years, new deliveries to Asia Pacific will be 41%, followed by 20% and 16% in Europe and North America, respectively.



Again, Boeing anticipated the commercial fleet to double over the next two decades to 45,240 airplanes by the end of 2035, fueled by sustained 4.8% annual growth in commercial passenger traffic. About 40% of the total commercial demand is likely come from the Asian markets, another 40% from Europe and North America, and the balance from the rest of the world.



Boeing provided its 20-year forecast for average annual cargo traffic growth at 4.2%. By the end of the period under consideration, the company expects that the world will need 930 new freighters and 1,440 converted freighters.



Other Players in the Space



Undoubtedly, Boeing and Airbus dominate the commercial aerospace manufacturing market, with major airlines worldwide using their airplanes. Nevertheless, Canada’s Bombardier Inc. BDRAF and Brazil’s Embraer S.A. ERJ are also in the commercial race but their presence in the market is negligible compared to the former two.



Embraer continues to lead the 70- to 130-seat commercial jet market. In 2016, the company released its 20-year Market Outlook, according to which it expects total market deliveries of 6,400 jets – 2,300 units in the 70- to 90-seat segment and 4,100 units in the 90- to 130-seat segment by 2035.

Story continues

The 70- to 130-seat jet world fleet-in-service will increase from 2,670 aircraft in 2015 to 6,690 by 2035, thereby making it the fastest growing aircraft seat segments among all. Replacement of ageing aircraft will represent about 37% of new deliveries, while 63% of deliveries will represent market growth.



Last 12-Month Return



In the last 12 months, Airbus’ stock has surged 47.1%, better than Boeing’s gain of 46.2%.





Both Boeing and Airbus’ return was better than the Zacks categorized Aerospace–Defense industry’s gain of 23.3% during the same time frame.

Additional need for 530,000 pilots and 550,000 technicians with services set to grow

The world’s passenger aircraft fleet above 100 seats is set to more than double in the next 20 years to over 40,000 planes as traffic is set to grow at 4.4 percent per year, according to Airbus’ latest Global Market Forecast 2017-2036.Over this period, increasing numbers of first time flyers, rising disposable income spent on air travel, expanding tourism, industry liberalisation, new routes and evolving airline business models are driving a need for 34,170 passenger and 730 freighter aircraft worth a combined total of US$5.3 trillion. Over 70 percent of new units are single aisle with 60 percent for growth and 40 percent for replacement of less fuel efficient aircraft.A doubling in the commercial fleet over the next 20 years sees a need for 530,000 new pilots and 550,000 new maintenance engineers, and provides Airbus’ global services business a catalyst to grow. Airbus has expanded its global network of training locations from five to 16 in the space of three yearsAir traffic growth is highest in emerging markets such as China, India, the rest of Asia and Latin America and almost double the 3.2 percent per year growth forecast in mature markets such as North America and Western Europe. Emerging markets currently home to 6.4 billion of the world’s 7.4 billion population will account for nearly 50 percent of the world’s private consumption by 2036.“Air travel is remarkably resilient to external shocks and doubles every 15 years,” said John Leahy, Chief Operating Officer – Customers, Airbus Commercial Aircraft. “Asia Pacific continues to be an engine for growth, with domestic China to become the world’s largest market. Disposable incomes are growing and in emerging economies the number of people taking a flight will nearly triple between now and 2036.”Over the next 20 years Asia Pacific is set to take 41 percent of new deliveries, followed by Europe with 20 percent and North America at 16 percent. Middle class numbers will almost double to nearly five billion as wealth creation makes aviation even more accessible particularly in emerging economies where spending on air travel services is set to double.In the twin aisle segment, such as the A330 Family, A350 XWB Family and the A380, Airbus forecasts a requirement for some 10,100 aircraft valued at US$2.9 trillion.In the single aisle segment, such at the A320neo Family, Airbus forecasts a requirement for some 24,810 aircraft valued at US$2.4 trillion. Airlines adding capacity by upsizing to the largest single aisle, the A321, will find even more business opportunities with the A321neo thanks to its range up to 4,000nm and unbeatable fuel efficiency. In 2016, the A321 represented over 40 percent of single aisle deliveries and over 60 percent of single aisle orders."

Rockwell Collins and Airbus introduce self-reporting flight tracking solution - Military & Aerospace Electronics,"Fri, 23 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWxpdGFyeWFlcm9zcGFjZS5jb20vY29tbWVyY2lhbC1hZXJvc3BhY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS8xNDIyOTMyNC9yb2Nrd2VsbC1jb2xsaW5zLWFuZC1haXJidXMtaW50cm9kdWNlLXNlbGYtcmVwb3J0aW5nLWZsaWdodC10cmFja2luZy1zb2x1dGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a continued effort to improve the ability to track aircraft globally, Rockwell Collins has teamed with Airbus to introduce a new Onboard Aircraft Tracking solution. The solution monitors aircraft information to detect and alert when abnormal flight situations occur and will come standard on the A350 WXB and A380 and as an option for A320, A330 and A340 aircraft.



The Onboard Aircraft Tracking solution monitors a specific set of aircraft parameters that could indicate a problem with a flight, including such issues as low altitude, low speed, excessive pitch, engine failure and others. If triggered, the aircraft automatically begins to emit aircraft position information at an increased rate. The Onboard Aircraft Tracking function is implemented as an update to the Airline Operational Control (AOC) avionics software and is available for both forward fit and retrofit.



The Onboard Aircraft Tracking solution is designed to meet IATA’s Aircraft Tracking Task Force (ATTF) and concept of operations of ICAO’s Global Aeronautical Distress and Safety System (GADSS) standards for aircraft tracking which call for aircraft identification at least every 15 minutes during “normal operations” and at least every one minute during “abnormal operations.” Once the Onboard Aircraft Tracking solution sends an alert to the ground, the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) position reporting frequency increases to meet the one minute interval recommendation.

Airbus unveils combined and floating deployable flight recorders - Runway Girl Network,"Mon, 26 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTcvMDYvYWlyYnVzLXVudmVpbHMtY29tYmluZWQtYW5kLWZsb2F0aW5nLWRlcGxveWFibGUtZmxpZ2h0LXJlY29yZGVycy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a bold move towards improving the survivability of aircraft flight recorders for commercial aircraft worldwide, Airbus is working in partnership with L3 Technologies and DRS Leonardo to combine and duplicate audio and data recorders, together with a automatically jettisoned recorder for use in longhaul and extensive overwater flight operations.

To start, the partnership is combining the flight data recorder with the cockpit voice recorder in one smaller device, the cockpit voice and data recorder (CFDR). The reduced size enables an Airbus A320 family aircraft to carry two of the fixed, crash-protected, combined recorders instead of one of each of the separate black boxes, increasing redundancy and the likelihood of readable information surviving a crash.

The data storage of the CFDRs will also increase, enabling a total of 25 hours of voice recording, and increasing the amount of data that is available to investigators, pursuant to aircraft tracking standard requirements from UN body ICAO and European safety regulator EASA. Current recorders are only required to contain two hours of voice recording.

For longhaul aircraft or those with significant overwater missions — including the A321LR, A330, A350 XWB and A380 — the partnership has designed the automatic deployable flight recorder (AFDR) as a separate jettisonable and float-capable unit automatically deployed in the event of water contact or what Airbus calls “significant structural deformation”. This would not, for example, include a hard landing, collision with catering truck, or similar mishap, the partnership confirmed in a press conference at the Paris Air Show.

The deployable AFDR will also contain 25 hours of cockpit voice recording alongside flight data recorder information, plus an emergency locator transmitter to aid the rescue and recovery effort. “The deployment mechanism for the recorder is a spring that’s preloaded,” Martin Munro, VP and general manager of DRS Leonardo’s Canadian facility confirmed.

“When a series of ball bearings are released, the shaft comes up and causes the recorder — the beacon airfoil unit, as we call it — to release from its tray. There are two mechanisms for triggering the deployment of the recorder. One is a loop in the aircraft that detects the structural deformation of the aircraft, and that triggers the deployment. There’s also a hydrostatic switch built into this unit, and as the unit goes down below two meters in the water it will automatically trigger the release.”

Airbus expects to receive certification and launch the system in 2019, initially on the A350, Airbus’ commercial EVP of engineering Charles Champion confirmed.

However, and surprisingly, Champion told Runway Girl Network that this work is going on in parallel — rather than integrated with — work to transmit the information written to the recorders over inflight connectivity in the event of the detection of abnormal flight.

“Connectivity is managed in a different manner,” Champion said. “This is only storage, passive in a way. In parallel we are working with Rockwell Collins in order to be able to transmit data. This is a solution that is not on all aircraft — it depends a lot on what is the connectivity solution chosen by the airline. The challenge is to have full connectivity coverage in order to transmit the data. I think they are complimentary. We are discussing also and working currently in terms of transmitting data, but not associated with this. They are two separate avenues.”

While Kris Ganase, President of L3 Aviation Products Sector, noted that “right now we are just talking to Airbus” regarding the technology, Champion confirmed that Airbus does not intend to keep the technological advances in recorder type and audio quantity to itself: “We have no patent on that, and as it is an improvement of safety, this is free for L3 to discuss with other manufacturers if they wish to introduce it on their aircraft.”

Airbus' Urban Air Mobility Roadmap leads to an electric future - New Atlas,"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy11cmJhbi1haXItbW9iaWxpdHktcm9hZG1hcC1lbGVjdHJpYy1haXJjcmFmdC81MDExMy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The rapid modernization of the aerospace industry became evident in Paris this week when Airbus Group's recently appointed Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Paul Eremenko, rolled out the company's developing portfolio of urban air mobility solutions.

Eremenko is a distinct departure from previous CTOs in this tradition-steeped industry, as he hails from the disruptive technology end of town. Having just completed a two-year assignment as the inaugural CEO of the Airbus A3 Innovation Centre in San Jose, California, Eremenko previously worked on futuristic technologies at Google, Motorola and DARPA.

Having just completed a two-year assignment as the inaugural CEO of the Airbus A3 Innovation Centre in San Jose, California, Eremenko previously worked at Google, Motorola and DARPA. Airbus

Airbus A3's brief is to explore technologies that are potentially disruptive to the organization's core business and Eremenko was ideally qualified for the task, having previously worked as Director of Engineering for Google's Advanced Technology and Projects group (ATAP), the tech behemoth's equivalent to Lockheed-Martin's skunkworks, where he headed Project Ara, the modular smartphone hardware ecosystem. Eremenko joined Google when it purchased Motorola, where he had conceived and headed the initial Project Ara.

36-year-old Paul Eremenko's appointment to the CTO role for the entire Airbus Group speaks volumes for the future direction of the company and his presentation entitled Building the Third Golden Age of Aerospace paints a picture of great change within Airbus in coming years. Airbus

Before that, Eremenko (inset above) ran the Tactical Technology Office (TTO) at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), where he was awarded the Distinguished Public Service Medal by the Office of the Secretary of Defence. The son of the Ukrainian-American mathematician Alexandre Eremenko (recipient of the prestigious Humboldt Prize in Mathematics), Paul has a bachelor's degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics from MIT, a Master's degrees in Aeronautics from Caltech, and a law degree from Georgetown University.

That's an impressive resume considering Eremenko just turned 36 years of age, and his appointment to the CTO role and his presentation entitled Building the Third Golden Ageof Aerospace, foretells great change within Airbus. Airbus seems to be the first of the big aerospace institutions to have grasped that it doesn't just make airplanes, but is a mobility company.

The Airbus Urban Air Mobility Roadmap Airbus

Regular New Atlas readers will have seen most of the milestones outlined on the Airbus Urban Air Mobility Roadmap in great detail, so we've added a brief description of each vehicle and links to the original stories.

Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the perspective offered by lining them all up together is that the most recent prototypes, Vahana and CityAirbus, stand a far greater chance of taking aviation mainstream than anything that we have seen previously. The air taxi model currently being successfully trialed in Sao Paulo with Voom might rapidly progress the adoption of multicopter aviation.

""Airlines wanted a larger, better option in the large single-aisle segment with the operating advantages of the 737 MAX family,"" Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Kevin McAllister said in a statement.

""Adding the 737 MAX 10 gives our customers the most flexibility in the market, providing their fleets the range capability, fuel efficiency, and unsurpassed reliability that the 737 MAX family is widely known for.""

The 220-seat MAX 9's inability to compete against the 236-seat A321neo has been a sore spot for Boeing in an otherwise highly successful 737 MAX sales campaign. With the MAX 10, first teased in March by Boeing Commercial Airplanes sales boss Randy Tinseth, the company has certainly closed the gap.

As part of the launch, Boeing announced it had taken more than 240 orders and commitments for the MAX 10 worth as much as $30 billion at list prices. This includes a 50-plane order from Indonesia's Lion Air Group worth more than $6.2 billion at list prices, and a 40-aircraft order from India's SpiceJet — 20 of which were converted over from other MAX models.

General Electric Commercial Aviation Services also placed an order for 20 MAX 10s, while the leisure-travel giant TUI Group agreed to convert 18 of its 70 outstanding 737 orders to the pricier MAX 10.

The MAX 10 will be 66 inches longer than the MAX 9 and feature new levered main landing gear. In addition, Boeing promises the plane's fuel-sipping CFM International LEAP-1B engines, advanced aerodynamics, and state-of-the-art avionics will help the MAX 10 deliver the lowest unit costs of any single-aisle airliner in history.

However, the MAX 10 doesn't solve all of Boeing's 737 MAX problems. Even when equipped with an auxiliary fuel tank, the MAX 10 has a range of 3,700 miles, which can't match the extended-range A321neo LR's claimed 4,600-mile range.

But the 737 MAX 10 is a major step in the right direction for Boeing.

Airbus has crammed 80 more seats into its superjumbo - Yahoo Finance,"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9pbXByb3ZlZC1haXJidXMtYTM4MHBsdXMtbWFrZXMtcm9vbS0xMjU1MzA0MjEuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus A380 plus

In a bid to resuscitate sales of its struggling flagship A380, Airbus unveiled a new version of its iconic superjumbo with a host of upgrades on Monday at the 2017 Paris Air Show.

Airbus claims the plane — dubbed the A380plus — has been upgraded in five main areas including fuel efficiency and passenger capacity.

Airbus hopes the new development will make the A380, which hasn't generated a single new order in more than a year, more financially attractive for airlines.

""The A380plus is an efficient way to offer even better economics and improved operational performance at the same time,"" Airbus COO John Leahy said in a statement. ""It is a new step for our iconic aircraft to best serve worldwide fast-growing traffic and the evolving needs of the A380 customers.""

The most obvious upgrade made to the A380 is the addition of a set of split winglets that are designed to curtail the effects of induced drag and wingtip vortices. Airbus claims the improved aerodynamics created by the winglets will boost the plane's fuel economy by 4%.

In addition, Airbus increased the A380's passenger capacity by a whopping 80 seats to lower the plane's unit operating costs. Even though the A380 is certified to fly with more than 850 passengers, the plane is usually configured to fly with 497 passengers. The A380plus's upgraded interior is expected to boost that capacity to 575 seats.

Airbus A380plus

The airplane has made this happen in a variety of manners. At the front of the plane, the A380's grand staircase and pilots' rest quarters are gone. The grand staircase has been replaced by a tighter, space efficient version — making room for 20 additional passengers. At the same time, pilots' rest quarters have been merged with the flight attendants' crew rest facility on the lower deck of the plane — making way for three premium economy seats.

At the back of the plane, Airbus replaced the stylish spiral staircase with a traditional staircase. This allowed engineers to redesign the aft galley to create space for 14 more passengers.

Story continues

On the upper deck, Airbus made room for 10 additional business class passengers by removing the side storage areas.

The final 34 are created to by increasing the numbers of seats per row— perhaps the last thing passengers want to hear.

In economy, Airbus increased capacity by cramming 11 seats into a row instead of 10 — thereby creating room for 23 more passengers. The seats are to be configured in a 3-5-3 layout with five seats in the center section.

In premium economy, the A380plus will have nine-abreast seating instead of the traditional eight passengers per row. This is expected to make room for 11 passengers.

Over the past few years, Airbus has flirted with the possibility of an A380neo or New Engine Option with new fuel efficient engines, avionics, and a redesigned wing. The Neo is something Emirates, the A380's largest customer, has lobbied heavily for over the past few years. However, Airbus seems to have balked at the time and high development costs along with the prospect of few new customers in return.

The A380plus seems to be a stop-gap measure that may bring some of the savings of the full neo at a fraction of the development cost.

In total, Airbus claims the changes it has made for the Plus will reduce the cost per seat for the plane's customers by 13%.

No airlines have, thus far, taken up Airbus on its new and improved A380.

"Airbus, Palantir unveil Skywise IoT data platform for aviation - Runway Girl Network","Tue, 20 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTcvMDYvYWlyYnVzLXBhbGFudGlyLXVudmVpbC1za3l3aXNlLWlvdC1kYXRhLXBsYXRmb3JtLWZvci1hdmlhdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LE BOURGET — Airbus is making a major play for the operational and passenger benefits of the Internet of Things with its new Skywise open aviation data platform, in partnership with controversial US data analytics technology company Palantir.

In a Paris Air Show press conference with the chief executive officers of AirAsia and ANA low-cost carrier Peach, plus recorded testimonials from easyJet’s Carolyn McCall and Emirates SVP engineering support Ahmed Safa, Airbus revealed that it is aiming to use big data not only to make its airline customers’ operations more efficient and productive, but to feed back into the design of the next generation of cabins and aircraft.

Today’s announcement was less than crystal clear in a number of areas, but it kicks off phase one of the Skywise programme, with the identification of the core platform. Next up in this phase will be integration of connectivity solutions, followed by selected applications and integrated dashboards. Phase two, headlined as “development” will include an extension to the rest of the Airbus group product line, including military, space and helicopters, together with what the airframer calls “a user-centric portfolio of applications, especially in maintenance and engineering, flight operations and fleet planning”. At the “mature stage”, phase three, Airbus hopes that Skywise will be “the heart of the industry, the cornerstone of the entire supply chain, inspiring R&D and new services, i.e., aircraft-as-a-sensor”.

Responding to a Runway Girl Network question on why Airbus is taking such a strong lead despite other aviation industry partner companies already doing much work in this arena across airframers, Airbus’ digital transformation officer Marc Fontaine said that “everybody is reaching the same conclusion” on the IoT, citing Airbus’ aircraft production role in the industry as a principal reason for the airframers move.

Palantir CEO Alex Karp highlighted to RGN that the partnership hopes to make Airbus’ engineers and their expertise more vital to the company rather than less, noting that the question he was asking is “how do you augment the value of an engineer, rather than replacing the engineer…making every employee at Airbus more valuable, not replaced by some algorithm. This is a really important part of why an initiative like this is valuable: because you want to create innovation and make the workers more important, as opposed to having innovation and unemployed people.”

easyJet CEO Carolyn McCall underlined the operational benefits of Skywise, saying “Over two years our engineers and IT team have been working very closely with Airbus to build the capability to capture the data created by the aircraft systems to try and help minimise and prevent delays. Through this work we have managed to identify the most frequent 100 aircraft faults that cause disruption to our passengers and have been working out how to use the data to detect these faults as they develop.

“Punctuality is important to our customers and so we want to do all possible to minimise disruption from technical events. Prognosis systems like the Airbus Skywise platform can really transform the way that we maintain our aircraft. The data obtained enables us to predict potential issues before they arise and start troubleshooting before the aircraft even lands which could help move us closer to our goal of eliminating technical delays,” McCall said.

Speaking to Runway Girl Network after the announcement, AirAsia chief executive Tony Fernandes — a real enthusiast for the operational benefits of the IoT for aviation and the passenger experience, it turns out — explained that he expects significant benefits from Skywise. “It’s all about efficiency. Data provides you with information to make better-informed decisions. I’m thrilled: I’ve been pushing for this for a while, so as soon as Airbus mentioned it we were thrilled.”

“In terms of inflight service,” Fernandes said, “we’d be able to know a lot better how to serve our customers vis-à-vis food. Obviously, with data, we’d be getting it from a few places, not just from this, knowing our customers, knowing who’s on there, what they’ve bought before, what they like, their preferences. Our cabin crew will be armed to a similar device as you’re holding, and we’ll know all 180 passengers that are on the flights.”

Management information to make better #PaxEx decisions is also key, Ferndandes notes: “I’ve always wondered whether it’s worth even putting in a recline. That would save us a lot of money if we didn’t have a recline, but we’re not going to say ‘Joe Bloggs didn’t recline his seat’ or ‘went to the bathroom eight times’.”

The problem is, of course, that unless the systems are designed to separate passenger-beneficial marketing data with personally identifying information (like faith-certified meal preferences linked to a flyer’s ID, for example) from aggregated information (like “85% of passengers didn’t use the recline button”) the data will be out there, available for mining, at risk of intrusion, and without an easy optout.

Tony Fernandes may not care that Joe Bloggs went to the bathroom eight times, but Joe Bloggs’ lavatorial data needs to be protected. If Joe’s medical insurance company, as just one example, has access to that data, then there are real privacy implications to its collection and use.

Airbus, as a European company, will need to ensure that its partnership with an American firm close to the current US administration is in line with EU data protection and storage laws — and, indeed, that its selection of technology partners is acceptable to an increasingly privacy-minded flying public.

PARIS (Reuters) - Emirates, the world's largest A380 customer, would be interested in changes being made to its current fleet of the superjumbo that manufacturer Airbus said this week would only be for new aircraft.

Airbus unveiled an upgraded version of the world's biggest passenger jet on Sunday, seeking to boost demand for the slow-selling superjumbo and including a new wingtip design aimed at reducing fuel burn by up to 4 percent.

Airbus Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier said on Monday the wingtips would only be put into production if Airbus received ""a large order.""

""If they said we’ll give you these winglets on a retrofit basis, to save up to 2.5 percent fuel, I would look at that,"" Emirates President Tim Clark told reporters at the Paris Airshow on Wednesday.

Emirates is by far the largest A380 customer, having ordered 142 of the jets with 95 in its fleet today.

Clark said he would be interested in ordering more A380s ""but I don’t want to be left with a pup, with a plane that is going into obsolescence.""

Broughton

Situated in North Wales near Chester, the plant at Broughton is responsible for producing the wings for Airbus' entire portfolio of commercial aircraft. The facility share a 6,703 ft (2,043m) runway with Hawarden Airport, enabling the manufacturer's A300-600ST Super Transporters, known as Belugas, to move components to Airbus sites on the Europe continent.

Transportation

The wings of A319, A320, A321, A330, A350 are moved from Broughton to the final assembly lines in Hamburg and Toulouse using a fleet of five Beluga Aircraft. The type can carry 4 pair of A320 family wings or 2 A330 wing or 1 A350 wing.

During my visit, I was lucky to witness the offloading and loading process completed within 90 minutes in the newly built hangar that can handle all weather situations regardless of wind.

Airbus A380

Broughton's west factory is home to wing production for the largest member of Airbus' commercial portfolio, the A380. The 350 million pound facility was opened by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and today more than 800 people work around the clock on the manufacture, assembly and equipping process. The Airbus A380's wing measures almost 9,096 sq ft and consists of more than 25,000 different components. Each wing weighs 40 tonnes and is over 118 ft (36m) long. The wings are built vertically and moved around the site by transporters and jigs.

Because the A380's wing is so large, it cannot be transported by Beluga. It is instead transported by a special built Barge and taken to Mostyn, Northern Wales. From there it is shipped to Bordeaux and driven by road to Toulouse.
