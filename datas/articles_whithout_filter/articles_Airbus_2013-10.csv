Airbus CEO confident sales will grow - USA TODAY,"Thu, 24 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmF2ZWwvZmxpZ2h0cy8yMDEzLzEwLzI0L2FpcmJ1cy1icmVnaWVyLzMxNzg0MTMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus CEO confident sales will grow

WASHINGTON — The head of France-based airplane manufacturer Airbus expects sales to grow for the foreseeable future because U.S. airlines are replacing aging fleets and Asian airlines are expanding.

""We believe that the market will grow 5% per year,"" Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier told USA TODAY. ""There is no bubble.""

He spoke during a conference here for 400 suppliers from around the world.

""It's a strong signal meaning that we are very international and a global player,"" Bregier said. ""The image of Airbus being only of Europe is totally wrong. We are totally international.""

Airbus spends $13 billion a year supporting 226,000 jobs in the United States, he said. Airbus plans to produce A320s at a plant in Mobile, Ala., starting in 2016.

Airbus competes with Boeing to provide planes to major airlines. Boeing reported strong earnings Wednesday, up 12% for the third quarter, with plans to boost production of the 787 Dreamliner after some problems in the early months of service of the composite, fuel-efficient plane. Boeing plans to increase production from 10 to 12 per month in 2016 and to 14 per month by the end of the decade.

But Airbus recently scored a coup by winning an order from Japan Airlines for 31 of its fuel-efficient A350 planes to break up the monopoly that Boeing had enjoyed with the airline. Bregier said JAL was rebuilding after bankruptcy and found they could build a trusting, long-term relationship between the companies.

""They discovered competition has a lot of virtues,"" Bregier said. ""Nothing magic.""

By 2018, Bregier said Airbus will deliver more planes than Boeing. He expects to deliver 120 A350s, on top of the current production of A320s and A380s.

""They are ramping up on the 787, and we will do that with the 350, but starting at the end of next year,"" Bregier said. ""What counts is that steadily I increase my deliveries and my profitability.""

Bregier argued that demand for planes is strong even with both manufacturers increasing production because orders are for delivery in 2020.

The demand is because Asia has growth of more than 10% a year, with 85% of the population having never flown, Bregier said.

In America, the airlines need to buy new planes to remain competitive and cut fuel costs, he said.

While orders for the jumbo A380 have slumped, Bregier remains optimistic about the plane's prospects. The company has 150 orders for the plane but will fall a bit below planned production of 30 planes per year in 2015.

""This market right now is pretty soft for very big aircraft,"" Bregier said. ""We believe that the airlines will need to procure big aircraft because of the congestion of the airports."""
Airbus launches Sharklet retrofit for in-service A320 Family aircraft - Airbus,"Tue, 29 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxMy0xMC1haXJidXMtbGF1bmNoZXMtc2hhcmtsZXQtcmV0cm9maXQtZm9yLWluLXNlcnZpY2UtYTMyMC1mYW1pbHnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

Cuts fuel burn by up to 4%, lengthens in-service life

Airbus has launched the Sharklet retrofit programme for in-service A320 Family aircraft. This option will be available in 2015. Operators of older in-service A320 Family aircraft will thus be able to benefit from the significant cost savings and performance improvements which the Sharklets are already delivering on new-build aircraft.This retrofit includes reinforcing the wing structure and adding the Sharklet wingtip device. As part of the upgrade, the retrofit will lengthen the aircraft’s service life and thus maximise the operators’ return on investment for the Sharklet retrofit.Didier Lux, Airbus Executive Vice President, Customer Services said: “Customers of new A320 Family aircraft are unanimously enthusiastic about the benefits which Sharklets already bring to their operations. Now we can also offer this value-adding technology for upgrading their in-service aircraft, to increase range, reduce fuel-burn, while saving over 900 tonnes of CO2 per year, per aircraft.”Operators of Sharklet retrofitted aircraft will benefit from a reduction in fuel costs by up to four per cent and increased mission range by up to 100 nautical miles. Over 4,000 A320 Family in-service aircraft are eligible to be retrofitted with Sharklets and Airbus has already secured commitments from airlines for around 200 shipsets. Airbus will offer the retrofit initially for A320 and A319 models and will evaluate a retrofit for the A321 at a later stage.Airbus has been delivering Sharklets as an option on new-build A320 Family aircraft since December 2012. In addition, the Sharklet retrofit option is being sold for newer aircraft delivered with the wings structurally reinforced in production. All members of the A320neo Family will be fitted with Sharklets as standard. The A320neo will enter into service in October 2015.The A320 Family is the world’s best-selling and most modern single aisle aircraft Family. To date, over 9,900 A320 Family aircraft have been ordered and over 5,700 delivered to more than 388 customers and operators worldwide. With proven reliability and extended servicing periods, the A320 Family has the lowest operating costs of any single-aisle aircraft."
"In blow to Boeing, Japan Airlines makes deal to buy from Airbus - The Washington Post","Mon, 07 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXNoaW5ndG9ucG9zdC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvZWNvbm9teS9pbi1ibG93LXRvLWJvZWluZy1qYXBhbi1haXItbGluZXMtbWFrZXMtZGVhbC10by1idXktZnJvbS1haXJidXMvMjAxMy8xMC8wNy83NTg0ZTk0Yy0yZjdmLTExZTMtODkwNi0zZGFhMmJjZGUxMTBfc3RvcnkuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Japan Airlines signed an agreement Monday to buy aircraft from European maker Airbus, snapping the near-

monopoly that Boeing has enjoyed in Japan for more than a half-century. Chicago-based Boeing has a fierce global rivalry with Airbus. The decision by JAL to buy 31 Airbus A350 wide-body jets is particularly jarring because of how secure Boeing’s foothold in Japan had seemed, analysts said.

But Boeing's continued problems delivering its 787 Dreamliner as promised has dented the company's credibility with major air carriers, said Richard Aboulafia, a longtime industry analyst with the Teal Group.

The promise of planes such as the Airbus 350 and Boeing’s 787 and 777X — an updated version of the popular 777 — is that they can carry more passengers with greater fuel efficiency. Carriers feeling pressure to keep fuel prices down are agitating for next-generation planes, and picking the right aircraft maker is a high-stakes business — a plane that has delivery delays could hurt profits and help competitors.

Analysts said Boeing's loss of the Japan Airlines deal seemed largely self-

inflicted. Boeing's 787 Dreamliner has been beset with delays in development and high-profile battery problems. In January, a Dreamliner operated by JAL had an electrical fire while parked at Logan International Airport in Boston.

Also that month, the Federal Aviation Administration grounded six new Dreamliners flown by United Airlines because of concerns about overheating batteries on the planes. In Japan, ANA and Japan Airlines also grounded their Dreamliners.

Aboulafia said Boeing has been cutting costs on engineering to raise its stock price, rather than focusing on delivering its planes on time.

There have been other signs of Airbus's encroachment on the wide-body-jet market. In recent months, Cathay Pacific and International Airlines Group, parent of British Airlines, have placed orders for Airbus 350s.

“People did see this coming,” Aboulafia said. “You can mess around for a year or two, that’s fine. You’re going to lose a couple people. You lost Cathay Pacific. You lost IAG. Whatever you do, don’t lose Japan.”

Aboulafia said that with JAL making the move, other Japanese carriers could follow.

“Boeing does have a very good product mix,” Aboulafia said. “It’s not a product issue, it’s a management issue.”

Boeing’s stock dipped 0.4 percent, while Airbus parent European Aeronautic, Defence & Space rose more than 2 percent in Paris. Boeing did not respond to a request for comment."

In a significant victory for Airbus, the European aircraft maker has broken into Japan, announcing on Monday a deal to sell 31 A350 aircraft valued at $9.5 billion based on list prices to Japan Airlines.

Japan is a strategic Boeing market where the U.S.-based plane maker has an around 80 percent market share.

At the same time, Boeing will ""probably make inroads into European-based carriers, which have been historically Airbus-focused. They're looking into each other's markets to gain share,"" said Timothy Ross, an analyst at Credit Suisse .

Last month, Lufthansa , which traditionally leans toward Airbus, decided to split an order for 59 wide-body jets between Boeing and Airbus. Air France last year also split a 50-plane order between the two.

Both Airbus and Boeing have been jockeying for orders from Japan as JAL and Nippon Airways are preparing to update their fleets.

ANA is expected to purchase around 25 aircraft. JAL currently flies around 214 planes in total. All Nippon Airways, Japan's largest airline, flying around 230 aircraft, is also considering whether to order Airbus jets and it is expected to announce its decision soon.

Competition for these orders is only likely to become keener as carriers look beyond the initial price discounts they might receive for large orders from a single manufacturer."

TOKYO - Usually when Jap­anese airlines need to buy a big plane, they go to Boeing. Not this time.

Japan Airlines ordered its first Airbus jets on Monday. It's buying 31 A350s, the European plane maker's new long-range, fuel-efficient jet. JAL also has an option to buy 25 more Airbus planes.

Monday's deal is the first for the A350 in Japan and marks a big change in policy for JAL. Boeing had been the airline's major supplier for decades and has dominated Japan's aviation market.

""If there's one place Boeing could have regarded as a secure market, it was Japan,"" said aerospace consultant Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group.

The order is worth 950 billion yen ($9.5 billion) at list prices, although discounts are common. Some analysts even think that JAL may be getting the planes for below cost as Airbus looks to make inroads in Boeing's domain.

The U.S. and Japan have been big trading partners since the end of World War II. And to strengthen its ties with Japanese airlines, Chicago-based Boeing has been shifting more and more work over the years to Japanese suppliers. About one-third of its new 787 is built in Japan.

Choosing suppliers that give Boeing ""a market access advantage"" is an ""important consideration,"" said Kent Fisher, Boeing's supply chain chief, at a presentation in May. ""We're not going to shy away from that. That is an issue that we consider in the process, but it's not the only issue.""

Boeing will have the right planes to compete with the A350, but it's taking too long to finalize their designs so they can book firm orders, Aboulafia said. It plans updates for its large, long-haul 777 as well as a longer version of its new long-range 787, but neither design has been finalized to a point where Boeing can take orders.

JAL and Japan's other big airline, All Nippon Airways, both had to wait through long delays before Boeing delivered 787s in 2011. More 787s fly with Japanese airlines than anywhere else, so the impact of the 787's grounding for battery problems this year was worst for the Japanese airlines.

But JAL President Yoshiharu Ueki said the grounding wasn't a factor in buying the Airbus plane. He repeatedly said the long-range, twin-engine wide-body A350 was chosen because it was the ""best match for our needs.""

Airbus has been eager to break into the Japanese market.

The new A350s are due to arrive in 2019. Ueki declined to give the specific flight routes where these jets will be used, but said they will basically take over the routes of retiring 777s.

Boeing said Monday's deal did not hurt its relationship with JAL.

""Although we are disappointed with the selection, we will continue to provide the most efficient and innovative products and services that meet longer-term fleet requirements for Japan Airlines,"" it said in a statement.

""We have built a strong relationship with Japan Airlines over the last 50 years and we look to continue our partnership going forward.""

JAL is a special kind of carrier in Japan because of its close ties with the government. But Ueki said JAL did not consult the government or other parties in making its decision.

JAL fell into bankruptcy three years ago. It emerged last year in one of the biggest IPOs in Japanese history following a government bailout and a wide-ranging restructuring.

The carrier was long the symbol of Japan's economic rise. However, in recent decades, it was hobbled by a bloated workforce, unpopular routes and safety lapses."

Airbus calls for wider seats on long flights - CNN,"Mon, 28 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vbW9uZXkuY25uLmNvbS8yMDEzLzEwLzI4L25ld3MvY29tcGFuaWVzL2FpcmJ1cy13aWRlci1zZWF0cy9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is calling on the airline industry to require wider seats on long-haul flights, citing a new study that found that just an extra inch of room vastly improves in-flight comfort and sleep quality.

The study from The London Sleep Centre found that seats, with a width of 18 inches, led to a 53% improvement in passenger sleep quality compared to the 17-inch standard offered by many airlines.

Airbus, part of the pan-European aerospace conglomerate EADS (EADSF), is hoping that all airlines will adopt the 18-inch standard for long-haul flights.

Airbus' call seemed more like a missive aimed at its rival across the ocean, Boeing (BA), which makes planes with narrower seats, said U.S.-based airline consultant Jay Sorensen from IdeaWorksCompany.

""It's a rather shameless attempt at self-promotion using statistics from sponsored research,"" said Sorensen.

Related: American Airlines plans to pack more people onto planes

Airbus said that seats on its long-haul planes were already at least 18 inches wide.

The company said ""other manufacturers [were] eroding passenger comfort standards by going back to narrower seat widths.""

The aircraft manufacturer said the 1950's standard of 17 inches is out of date, as more people are flying frequent long-haul flights.

Airbus also noted that other industries -- including the auto industry -- had already moved to accommodate expanding waistlines and people's expectations for more personal space.

Sorensen said that ""Airbus has conveniently picked a dimensional aspect that benefits them. Note that they are not addressing seat pitch -- the space between rows -- or recline angle."" He pointed out that if Boeing were forced to widen its seats, the planes wouldn't fit as many passengers.

Boeing was not immediately available for comment.

Airbus and Boeing are known to be fierce competitors in the commercial aviation space, vying for multi-billion dollar orders from large airlines operators around the world."

When passengers on Air France’s Flight 006 land at New York City’s Kennedy Airport from Paris on Thanksgiving Day they may also have the distinction of arriving on one of the biggest turkeys in aviation history, the Airbus super jumbo A380. Airbus has no new orders for the jet this year, and Lufthansa recently canceled three A380s—it had ordered 17—which typically have 500 to 525 seats. Airports are required to build special gates just to board and unload that many passengers. Air France/KLM, which launched its A380 service with much fanfare, doesn’t want any more as it continues to restructure. Orders at Virgin Atlantic (6) and Hong Kong Airlines (10) seem vulnerable while an option taken by finance firm Doric Asset Finance for 20 of the big birds hasn’t been converted to a firm order.

No U.S. carrier has stepped up to buy the A380 and none likely will. “The A380 is, by definition, an uneconomic airplane unless you’re a state-owned enterprise with subsidies,” said Delta ceo Richard Anderson in a recent speech. He’s making a reference to Emirates and Singapore Airlines, who own about 45% of all planned deliveries. Emirates has 35 A380s operating out of a total order of 90. According to aviation expert Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Teal Group, there have been 167 net A380 orders over the last decade. Airbus planned to build 30 A380s annually but the current rate is less than 17 per year. “The people who are in the order book are the order book,” Aboulafia says, meaning the potential to add new orders is limited.

As things now stand, it is unlikely that the A380 will produce anything but a write-down for Airbus and its parent company EADS (soon to be called Airbus Group), which invested something on the order of $25 billion to get the first A380 airborne. The jet lists for about $400 million, but you can make them an offer: the going rate is somewhere north of $200 million.

(MORE: How the Airlines Put the Squeeze on Passengers)

Passengers seem perfectly happy with the A380, which has the coolest takeoff feel—it’s like being in an elevator, not a jet— since the supersonic Concorde. (Some versions have what has been called the world’s most luxurious accommodations.) But, for operators, the A380 was launched in 2000 to solve a problem that never materialized. Planners perceived an air travel corridor that was going to be so cramped with traffic that jumbos would seemingly have to play a role. But global deregulation, which has allowed more airlines to fly transnationally from more places, eliminated some of the need for collecting large amounts of passengers in one hub like Paris or Frankfurt and then sending them on to other big hubs.

Airbus hasn’t given up on that notion. Canceling orders may be fashionable now, said its COO for customers John Leahy, but just wait two years when the skies are even more crowded and see who needs what. In the Airbus view, the world will need 1711 very large aircraft over the next 20 years, in part because traffic will double in 15 years.

Airbus is absolutely rocking in other aircraft categories. The company now has 725 firm orders for the A350 XWB, a twin-aisle, long-range aircraft that is undermining its big brother. The A350 helped Airbus crack the code in Asia, winning an order of 31 A350 XWBs from Japan Airlines, once a Boeing captive. It was a huge victory for the Europeans. “It’s not about capacity, it’s about range and economics,” says Aboulafia. Similarly, Airbus has a ton of orders for its single-aisle jets, including the new A320neo, the most fuel-efficient version of that model yet. Airbus grabbed 1,062 new orders this year, putting it ahead of its great rival Boeing, and a record backlog of nearly 5,300 jetliners, or about eight years of production. It’s going to be busy in Toulouse for some time."

Allan McArtor believes there will always be a market for the Very Large Aircraft (VLA), but he’s not surprised Boeing cut the production rate of the 747-8.

McArtor, who as chairman of Airbus Americas, is hardly an unbiased observer. He says the 747-8 Intercontinental is uneconomic and the market for the 747-8F is weak. But he also acknowledged that the dearth of sales for the Airbus A380 has been a challenge.

Airbus has forecast 1,200-1,300 VLA-Passenger deliveries over a 20 year period every year since 2000, while Boeing has steadily reduced its forecast to just 540 VLAPs in its current forecast. Airbus believes it will capture 50% of the market, based on its forecast. In fact, it currently is capturing between 86%-90% of the sales.

Each forecasts several hundred more VLA-Freighter deliveries during the next 20 years. Boeing currently holds a monopoly in the VLAF sector, but sales haven’t been on a pace to meet either company’s forecast, nor have sales of the A380 remotely maintained a pace that suggests Airbus will meet its own forecast, without dramatically adjusting both the total market and its market share expectations.

In an interview with Leeham News, McArtor maintained there will “always” be a demand for the VLA. He acknowledged that one can quibble with the forecast or the timing, but airport constraints and growing markets between key cities, such as London-Tokyo, London-New York, Paris-Tokyo or New York and similar segments, will demand a VLAP.

Airbus so far this year has has a net order for the A380 of minus three, but it signed a Memorandum of Understanding for 20 from specialty lessor Doric during the Paris Air Show. This is expected to be firmed up before the end of the year, potentially at the Dubai Air Show.

Boeing is also expected to make a splash at Dubai with the highly anticipated public launch of the 777X, with a large order from Emirates Airlines. The airplane, with a new composite wing, new engines, systems upgrades and cabin modifications, will come in a 350-seat 777-8 and a 407-seat 777-9. The 777-8 directly competes with the Airbus A350-1000. The 777-9 doesn’t have an Airbus competitor and at nominally 407 seats falls just within the VLA sector, which begins at 400 seats.

At the ISTAT conference in Barcelona this month, Airbus’ John Leahy, COO-Customers, said the company is studying a possible stretch of the A350-1000 that would presumably be a competitor to the 777-9, but then he backtracked a bit, telling reporters “there is no story here.”

McArtor provided a little clarity in our interview.

“We look at a lot of hypotheticals all the time,” he said. “Do we have a program to do that? No. Do we have a[n internal] proposal to do that? No. We’re pretty comfortable with the family of airplanes we have.”

Many, including this column, believe the 777-9 will kill off the somewhat larger 747-8I and adversely impact the A380. McArtor somewhat sidestepped this question, saying, “The A350-1000 would impact the A380 if any would.”

“If I had my druthers, we’d stretch the A380,” McArtor told us. “It’s begging to be stretched.”

As for the prospect of a Boeing 757 replacement that would also mean replacing the Boeing 737-900ER/9 MAX and A321ceo/neo, McArtor doesn’t think a similarly sized replacement may make sense. Continued up-gauging trends may suggest the 757 replacement might well be a larger aircraft that falls to the A330-200 250-seater, he says.

Of course, this brings the market to the Boeing 787-8, but this plane has a range of 8,000nm vs the 4,000sm of the 757; and potentially an A330-200 Lite, a lighter gross weight/reduced thrust, shorter-range version of today’s A330-200 which has a range of 7,200nm. Some would suggest neither airplane is optimized to be a true 757 replacement, just as neither are the 737-900ER/9 nor the A321ceo/neo.

Also, by 2025, when a 757 replacement is envisioned, the A330-200 will be 30 years old, a design from the late 1980s/early 1990s, with an EIS of 1994.

“I think we can make incremental improvements to the A330 and probably keep the program going: a new engine, winglets, avionics,” McArtor said. “Personally I don’t think Boeing is ready to commit to a 757 replacement. I think they’d use the lower-end 787.”

(JAL), holds a model of an Airbus A350 aircraft during their joint news conference in Tokyo, Japan,

The order follows an intense battle between the plane-makers as Japan's two top carriers seek dozens of new long-haul jets over the next decade.

The deal involves the sale of 31 A350 aircraft to Japan Airlines and is worth $9.5 billion based on list prices. The first aircraft will be delivered in 2019, according to the announcement..

Airbus announced it had won its first jet order from Japan Airlines on Monday, breaking into the last major aviation market dominated by rival Boeing .

For decades, Boeing has seen off attempts by Airbus to secure an order with



Japan Airlines, benefiting from links with Japanese suppliers and deep political

and defence ties between Japan and the United States to maintain a market share

of more than 80 percent.



The two aircraft makers are still battling for a similar order at ANA , which is also looking for around 25 new jets to replace its aging fleet of long-haul Boeing 777s from 2020.



ANA 's boss, Shinichiro Ito, told Reuters last month that his airline would consider possible delivery delay risks when choosing. Delays to deliveries of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, which is one-third built in Japan, and its subsequent grounding because of overheating batteries may have made Japan's airlines wary of being a launch customer for the 777X, giving Airbus a rare opening in Boeing's best market.

Industry sources said in August that the U.S. plane-maker had edged ahead in a see-saw contest with its European rival as it defends dominance in Japan. But both sides have been seen as striving to win coveted endorsements for their latest long-distance jets from JAL and ANA.



Boeing is looking for Japanese support for a proposed revamp of its best-selling 777 long-haul jet, the yet-to-be-launched 777X, while Airbus is pushing a larger version of its upcoming A350 aircraft, whose base model enters service in 2014.

Japanese suppliers including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, which account for one-third of the 787, are expected to join the 777X program too, although Boeing has yet to say how much work they will get.



JAL's shares rose as much as 3.4 percent in early trade to 5,830 yen, compared with a flat Tokyo benchmark Nikkei average .

Japan Air to purchase 31 Airbus A350s for $9.5 billion - FRANCE 24 English,"Mon, 07 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi8yMDEzMTAwNy1qYXBhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1zdHJpa2VzLTktNS1iaWxsaW9uLWRlYWwtYWlyYnVzLWEzNTDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"AVIATION

Japan Airlines is ordering 31 Airbus A350 planes worth a total of some $9.5 billion, the airline said Monday. It is the first-ever Airbus deal for the Japanese flagship and part of a move to replace its ageing fleet from US manufacturer Boeing.

Japan Airlines said Monday it is ordering 31 Airbus A350 planes in a deal valued at $9.5 billion, challenging Boeing's dominance in the Japanese market as it struggles with the troubled Dreamliner.

The carrier said it had signed a purchase agreement for 18 long-haul A350-900s and 13 A350-1000s, with an option to buy another 25 aircraft.

The deal marks the first time JAL has bought Airbus planes with the slate of new aircraft expected to come into service from 2019, the carrier said, as it replaces its ageing Boeing fleet.

The deal was announced after markets closed but investors cheered reports of the purchase earlier Monday with JAL's Tokyo-listed shares closing 3.01 percent higher at 5,810 yen as the broader marker fell 1.22 percent.

The push by the European plane maker comes as JAL and domestic rival All Nippon Airways (ANA) -- whose fleet is also dominated by Boeing -- have been sideswiped by problems with the Dreamliner.

The lightweight plane -- hailed for its fuel-efficiency but marred by years of production delays -- was grounded globally in January after lithium-ion batteries overheated on two different planes, with one of them catching fire while parked.

The Japanese carriers -- the single biggest operators of the Dreamliner -- have put their fleets back into service. But they are seeking compensation from US-based Boeing of more than $200 million for the string of problems which forced them to cancel flights and took a bite out of their bottom line.

""Considering the recent troubles with the Dreamliner, JAL may have reached the conclusion that it wants to avoid the risks,"" said Mitsuru Miyazaki, senior analyst at Tokyo's SMBC Friend Research Center.

""The aviation sector is a global industry so it's natural that Japanese airlines want to secure multiple sourcing options for their planes.""

Despite a lengthy investigation, Boeing has not identified the root cause of the Dreamliner's battery problems, but said it put safeguards in place to prevent future incidents.

On Monday, JAL pointed to the A350's lighter weight materials which help cut down on fuel costs, usually an airline's single-biggest cost -- a feature that Boeing played up with its Dreamliner.

The order comes as JAL embarks on a route expansion after it rose from the ashes of bankruptcy last year to re-list on the Tokyo stock exchange following an $8.5 billion initial public offering, one of the biggest offerings in 2012.

JAL posted strong earnings after its re-listing, making it the most profitable airline in the world, but a government bailout to rescue the carrier has led to acrimony between Japan's biggest airlines with ANA routinely criticising its rival's monster bailout.

On Friday, JAL said it had lodged a complaint over Tokyo awarding twice as many lucrative landing slots at a major airport to ANA, in an apparent attempt to level the playing field after the bailout.

That came two days after the government said ANA would get 11 of 20 new international take-off and landing slots at Haneda airport in Tokyo bay, the world's fourth-busiest hub.

JAL, which had expected to share the slots evenly with its main domestic rival, got just five with the remaining four slots to be distributed in the future

Fire Dept.

JetBlue rolled out its newest unique aircraft design last week, unveiling its ""Blue Bravest"" aircraft that's painted in the colors of the New York City Fire Department (FDNY). The Airbus A320 is adorned with the FDNY shield and will fly throughout JetBlue's route network.

JetBlue also has a number of other specially painted aircraft. Among those are jets painted in the color of sports teams such as the New York Jets and the Boston Red Sox and a tourism-themed ""I Love New York"" aircraft.

JetBlue notes its status as ""the only major airline actually based in New York"" in its effort to be ""supportive of its hometown firefighters, emergency medical technicians and paramedics.""

JetBlue says its Blue Bravest livery ""will support the FDNY Foundation … in its mission to raise awareness and promote fire safety and professional development, training, and education for members of the FDNY.""

""We are New York's Hometown Airline, we not only work here, we live here too,"" JetBlue CEO Dave Barger says in a release promoting the new aircraft livery. ""On a daily basis we see the hard work of firefighters, paramedics and emergency medical technicians who help keep our city safe. We appreciate their dedication and are excited to support our hometown heroes in a very JetBlue way. We've substituted our namesake blue and painted this airplane red, a special honor just for the FDNY Foundation.""

""With this incredible aircraft, JetBlue has created an outstanding tribute to the 15,000 members of the FDNY and the life-saving work they perform every single day,"" Fire Commissioner Salvatore J. Cassano says in JetBlue's release."
JAL selects Airbus A350s as it seeks to down-size aircraft capacity due to competition and costs | CAPA - CAPA - Centre for Aviation,"Mon, 07 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL2NlbnRyZWZvcmF2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS9hbmFseXNpcy9yZXBvcnRzL2phbC1zZWxlY3RzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwcy1hcy1pdC1zZWVrcy10by1kb3duLXNpemUtYWlyY3JhZnQtY2FwYWNpdHktZHVlLXRvLWNvbXBldGl0aW9uLWFuZC1jb3N0cy0xMzIxNjfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"JAL's order for 31 A350s makes it likely 777 replacement

The 07-Oct-2013 order for 31 A350s comprises 18 A350-900s and 13 A350-1000s, plus 25 options. This is the first time JAL has ordered aircraft directly from Airbus, excluding Japan Air System's Airbus orders JAL took on when it acquired the former domestic operator (they have since been withdrawn from JAL's fleet).

This is also Airbus' first order from one of Japan's two major airlines who jointly account for nearly 75% of Japan's domestic market and a quarter of its international market. Boeing had maintained a tight grip on ANA and JAL, partially due to government and economic pressures, such as the substantial role in manufacturing Boeing aircraft parts.

The A350-900 is a rival to the 777-200 family, both for regional and long-haul missions. JAL has 26 of those (with none on order) and has ordered 18 A350-900s. Some 777-200ERs are being replaced by 787s.

For example, in Dec-2013 a 787 will take over the 777-200ER on the Tokyo Narita-Sydney route. The A350-1000 is a rival to the 777-300ER. JAL has 13 A350-1000s on order and, not coincidentally, 13 777-300ERs in service with none on order.

JAL is moving towards smaller aircraft

The A350-900 and A350-1000 will be more efficient than the 777-200 and 777-300ER they will likely replace. One notable distinction is that the A350s are slightly smaller than the 777 versions. JAL has been down-gauging its fleet, first shedding 747s (at its peak, JAL operated over 80 747s) and is currently in the process of decreasing the number of large widebody aircraft in favour of mid-sized aircraft like the 787. The A350s will fulfil that objective.

The A350-1000 will likely be used on major long-haul routes where JAL's 777-300ERs currently fly (Tokyo Narita to Chicago, Frankfurt, Los Angeles, London Heathrow, New York JFK and Paris CDG). A350-900s can replace 777-200s on regional routes like Tokyo Haneda-Hong Kong and 777-200ER routes like Tokyo Narita-Honolulu, although JAL is decreasing the long-haul routes for the 777-200ER, preferring to use either the 787 or 777-300ER. JAL has replaced the 777-200ER once used on Narita-Moscow with a 787.

JAL Group fleet plan: 2011 to 2016

JAL evaluated the A350 against the 777X, the planned successor for the 777. The 777X is overall larger than the existing 777 models it will replace. Its entry into service is also further away (next decade) and none has yet been built, unlike the A350, which has already flown. JAL expects its first A350 in 2019 and for delivery to be completed over six years. By 2019 JAL's 777-200ERs will be 14-17 years old and its 777-300ERs 10-17 years old, according to CAPA's fleet database. This is suitable retirement age and, if anything, above the typical retirement age for Asian airlines, which prefer young fleets.

JAL's future widebody fleet will likely be comprised of the initial 31 A350s plus the 45 787s in service or on order. The 787s will mainly be used on thinner routes and the A350s on major ones.

JAL has one of the highest cost bases in Asia - this limits potential

The reason to move to smaller aircraft is largely due to two factors. First, Japan's population is declining, which will dampen travel demand. Economic reforms will take some time to materialise, but are not expected to restore Japan to its previous highs. So this limits point-to-point traffic JAL can carry to/from Japan.

Other airlines when faced with a small local market - Emirates, KLM, Singapore Airlines - have turned to relying on transfer traffic, using their hub as a mid point. But the successful execution of this is dependent partially on having a low cost base. JAL's cost base was decreased during its bankruptcy re-structuring, and its cost is lower than rival ANA. But JAL still has one of the most expensive cost bases in Asia - and the world, according to CAPA's CASK ranking in Asia.

Select Asian airline CASK measured against average stage lengths: 2012*

JAL has cut international capacity but is looking to grow again

Coinciding with the fleet cuts, JAL's international traffic has substantially reduced to half (35 billion RPKs in the year ending 31-Mar-2013) of peaks in recent history: 70 billion RPKs in the years ending 31-Mar-2003 and 31-Mar-2005.

JAL's cuts and ANA's growth means the two - once distant competitors - are separated by only about 5.5 billion RPKs.

ANA and JAL international RPKs: years ending 31-Mar from 2003 to 2013

ANA and JAL rely heavily on a single manufacturer

ANA and JAL rely predominantly on Boeing aircraft. All of JAL's mainline (excluding affiliates and subsidiaries) aircraft are from Boeing while for ANA the figure is 91% (17 A320s comprise the remaining share). The next closest major airlines largely relying on a single manufacturer are Lufthansa (81% Airbus) and US Airways (79% Airbus).

These figures only compare aircraft numbers and not their seat capacity or value.

Cathay Pacific for example is evenly split between Airbus and Boeing, but its Boeing aircraft have more seats and range than most of its Airbus aircraft. Almost half of Air Canada's fleet is comprised of Airbus aircraft, but these are mainly narrowbodies. Boeing has a 25% share, all of which are widebodies.

Manufacturer fleet share of selected major airlines' mainline in-service fleet: 07-Oct-2013

Two-thirds of A350s on order are from Asian airlines

Of the 629 A350s on order (prior to JAL's order), 225 - 36% - are from Asian airlines. The largest customers in the region are Singapore Airlines (70) and Cathay Pacific (48).

A350s on order with Asian airlines: 06-Oct-2013

Airbus is looking to enlarge its presence in Japan

JAL's order fulfils Airbus' long held wish to secure a blue-chip presence in Japan and this order will be seen as a significant breakthrough in the market. While Airbus has aircraft in Japan - 66, according to CAPA's fleet database - it did not take the existing aircraft to be significant.

AirAsia Japan and Jetstar Japan were using the aircraft type of their foreign parents. Airbus did not see local Peach, Skymark or Starflyer as key customers, although it was grateful for their business.

Airbus fleet presence in Japan: 07-Oct-2013

The upshot is that on the one hand JAL has received exceptional value on aircraft that accord within its strategic vision and on the other Airbus has broken into territory that has for so long evaded it. For Boeing the purchase, although unwelcome, will not come as a great surprise, after maintaining such a powerful hold on a key world market for so long.

From an overall airline perspective too, it is another example of the value of having a level of competition in the airframe market, where numerous aircraft sizes and performances are possible. In today's much more competitive environment, the concept of a one size fits all-747 fleet is very much a thing of the past."
Japan Airlines Orders 31 Jets From Airbus—Not Boeing - Bloomberg,"Mon, 07 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDEzLTEwLTA3L2phcGFuLWFpcmxpbmVzLW9yZGVycy0zMS1qZXRzLWZyb20tYWlyYnVzLW5vdC1ib2VpbmfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The skies over Asia grew decidedly less friendly for Boeing this week. Japan Airlines, after decades of sworn allegiance to the U.S. plane maker, ordered 31 long-haul jets from Airbus. The planes, all A350 models, have a cumulative list price of $10 billion, and JAL also inked an option to buy 25 more.

The landmark order shouldn’t be surprising. JAL, perhaps more than any other carrier, has been buffeted by the delays tied to Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner. It was the second airline to order the jet and thus bore the brunt of early delivery holdups. Almost one-quarter of JAL planes are non-Boeing, all of which are relatively small aircraft, and the carrier has no Airbus equipment in its fleet."

The ROP function automatically maximizes braking and alerts crews to use full thrust reverser.

Airbus Corporate Jets also announced the addition of new winglets for the ACJ310, which they call “sharklets.” The addition adds a 4 percent fuel efficiency improvement, plus 200 nautical miles of range, giving it a 6200-nm IFR range.

Airbus also announced that its latest ACJ was on display at the static display site at Henderson Airport just outside of Las Vegas. The airplane features a new design interior and is operated as a VVIP (maybe a few more “Vs?”) charter by Comlux.

The company added new interior options, including the Starlight ceiling and carpet lighting system, that uses LEDs to accentuate interior lighting. It also premiered a new layout, which creates 10 private “mini suites,” to allow private sleeping quarters for the entire entourage.

Airbus' A350-1000 dilemma - Leeham News and Analysis,"Thu, 31 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMy8xMC8zMS9haXJidXMtYTM1MC0xMDAwLWRpbGVtbWEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has a dilemma with what to do about the A350-1000.

.

Does the OEM stick with the -1000 as it is, ceding the 400 seat segment to Boeing with its new 777-9X? Or does it stretch the -1000 (we’ll call it the “1100” for a placeholder) for what appears to be a very limited market segment?

.

If Airbus does stretch the -1000, what does this stretch look like? One that will match the 9X range and capacity? Or one that matches the capacity but not the range?

Here are the implications of the dilemma facing Airbus.

.

Stay the Course

For a long time, Airbus officials said they were satisfied with the design, once tweaked, of the -1000 and they didn’t need to respond to a “paper” airplane. The characterization had a ring to it, for that’s what Boeing officials often said about the -1000: it wasn’t a “real” airplane, they didn’t know what it was, it was a “paper” airplane or some variation thereto.

.

Of course, this was rhetoric by both parties. Lufthansa Airlines ordered 34 777-9s. A huge order+option commitment is anticipated at the Dubai Air Show from Emriates Airlines for the -9 and the smaller, ultra-long range (ULR) -8 that is sized directly across from the -1000. Airbus is now faced with the prospect of Boeing once more having a monopoly position with the 777-9 as it did for many years with the 777-300ER.

.

Does Airbus want to cede the 400-seat segment to a Boeing monopoly? The question is, how big is this segment? Is there a business case to build the airplane, or one that’s big enough for two airplanes?

.

Boeing’s current 20 year forecast indicated there is a need for 4,530 “small” twin aisle, 200-300 seat jets and 3,300 for “medium” twin aisle jets, 300-400 seats, for a total 7,830. Airbus forecasts a need for 4,694 250-300 seat jets and 2,085 350-400 seaters, for 6,779 jets, a difference of nearly 1,100-but, then, Airbus doesn’t have a competitor to the 787-8 at the lower end of the small jet sector.

.

Airbus further breaks out its forecast: 2,438 250-seat and 2,256 300-seat jets within the “small” twin; and 1,306 350-seat and 779 400-seat jets within the “medium” twin category. Boeing doesn’t subdivide its forecast.

.

The 777-9 will kill the near-dormant 747-8 Intercontinental and will likely eat into sales of the Airbus A380. Does Airbus avoid cannibalizing its own product or does it allow Boeing the monopoly to do so?

Source: Great Circle Mapper

Match the 777-9

Airbus could decide that, despite a its own narrow forecast for a 400 seat segment, it would be better to play in this sandbox, whatever the impact on the A380, than to cede this segment to Boeing. The question then arises, does an A350-1100 match the 777-9 in seats (or come close to it) and range, around 8,100nm-8,400nm?

To match means a major undertaking for a small number of airlines that need a plane with this range. It means a new wing–typically a $3bn project, more or less–and new engines in the 104,000-105,000 lb thrust range. The Rolls-Royce Trent XWB on the A350-1000 is 97,000 lbs and it can’t be pushed any farther, our information tells us. The cost of developing an entirely new engine for such a narrow market doesn’t have a business case. One might exist on the presumption that engines have to get bigger, and a new engine design would provide the basis for an entirely new generation of engines. After all, the Trent fundamentally has been around since the A330. It may well be time, but is an A350-1100 the product from which to develop it? Furthermore, it takes at least seven years to develop a new engine and probably a lot longer. The engine is the pacing item, far more than the airframe. Even if the go-ahead were given this minute, Airbus and RR would be hard-pressed to come up with an A350-1100 by 2020, when the 777-9 EIS is anticipated. So…

The 787-10 Approach

The most viable option for stretching the A350-1000 appears to be following the approach Boeing took with the 787-10: a couple of simple fuselage plugs, some enhancements to the existing engines, the same wing and reduced range that covers 90% of the markets required by the airlines–foregoing the miniscule need by Emirates Airlines for that last 5%-10%.

Source: Great Circle Mapper

An A350-1100 with reduced range of 7,000nm-7,500nm and a 400 seat capacity would have highly favorable cost per available seat miles. It wouldn’t get you from Paris to Tahiti, but how big is this market? It wouldn’t get you from Dubai to Los Angeles, but are billions of dollars worth of R&D to do so going to get the return on investment to make sense for this airplane?

The clear choice, the financially responsible choice, and the expeditious choice appears to follow the Boeing approach and develop an A350-1100 (or, perhaps, the “A350-1000-10”).

Airbus breakthrough: Japan Airlines orders 31 firm+25 option A350-900s/1000s - Leeham News and Analysis,"Sun, 06 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMy8xMC8wNi9haXJidXMtYnJlYWt0aHJvdWdoLWphcGFuLWFpcmxpbmVzLW9yZGVycy0zMS1maXJtMjUtb3B0aW9uLWEzNTAtOTAwczEwMDBzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus scored a big breakthrough October 7 (Tokyo time) when Japan Airlines announced an order for 18 A350-900s, 13 -1000s and options for 25 more.

This is a huge win for Airbus and a big blow to Boeing’s decades-long wide-body monopoly in Japan.

*******************************************************************

Update, 06:15 am PDT: Here are a couple of stories about the order.

Reuters: Airbus clinches landmark deal.

CNBC: Deal shows loyalty fading fast

Reuters: Airbus sees JAL deal spurring R&D in Japan

AP via Seattle Times: JAL says deal unrelated to 787 woes

Airbus press release

Reuters, 0800 PDT: 787 woes did contribute to JAL Airbus purchase, says Boeing exec

********************************************************************

JAL, and its rival, All Nippon Airways, had been reported nearly a year ago giving serious thought to ordering the A350 as a way to diversify its reliance on The Boeing Co., long the exclusive supplier for wide-body aircraft at the two carriers.

The lengthy delays for the 787, followed by the 3 1/2 month grounding earlier this year, are widely believed to be behind the consideration to buy the A350. John Leahy, COO-Customers, told us in advance of the Paris Air Show that he did not expect orders to be announced at the international event (and they weren’t) but he hoped to conclude something before the end of the year.

Boeing has a deep relationship with Japan and its international carriers. Japan provided around US$2bn in financing to the so-called Japanese Heavies to help fund their participation in the 787. It was suggested, but never confirmed, that Boeing might build the 777X wings in Japan to snare orders and keep Airbus from winning an A350 deal.

Relationships mean everything in Japan, and the strong one between Boeing, the government and the airlines combined to make Airbus a miniscule player there. Fear of offending the Japanese is why Airbus and the European Union didn’t include the government’s funding of the Heavies for the 787 in the bitter international trade dispute between the EU and the United States.

news by Terry Spruce October 8, 2013 Print this page

The 24th ACJ319 leaves the Airbus Corporate Jet Centre complete with an executive lounge and 10 private suites.

The Airbus Corporate Jet Centre in Toulouse, France has delivered its 24th outfitted VIP ACJ319 corporate aircraft to an unnamed Middle Eastern customer.

“This latest cabin has reached a new step in terms of cabin innovation with new technologies and decorative materials ever seen aboard an Airbus Corporate Jet, said Benoit Defforge, chief executive officer of the Airbus Corporate Jet Centre.

“We also specially designed a full-scale mock-up in wood to validate ergonomy and space according to the client’s requirement, highlighting that we always go further to propose to our VIP customers the best comfort associated with the latest entertainment and connectivity systems technology.”

“It confirms our leading place in innovation and excellence in the Airbus corporate jet market,” added Defforge.

Traditionally, the Middle-East has been the best-performing region for Airbus Corporate Jets, where it is popular amongst royalty and high-net-worth individuals. The company has also seen recent growth in Greater China – where it enjoys a 58 per cent share of the corporate airliner market – and in Russia as well.

The 24th ACJ319 to be delivered from the French completions centre is split into two main zones capable of carrying 19 passengers.

The first zone is a wide and large forward dining and executive lounge with space for up to 12 passengers, combining a work area and a rest area. The second zone is an aft VIP suite section, providing ten private “mini suites.” These suites also include a personal, electrically actuated bar and many storage zones.

The VIP areas are complemented by a large aft bathroom, equipped with a full-height shower including a brand new timer system to provide the same quantity of hot water to every passenger."
Kazakhstan Air Force orders additional C295 aircraft from Airbus Military - Airforce Technology - Airforce Technology,"Sun, 27 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmZvcmNlLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kuY29tL25ld3MvbmV3c2themFraHN0YW4tYWlyLWZvcmNlLW9yZGVycy1hZGRpdGlvbmFsLWMyOTUtYWlyY3JhZnQtZnJvbS1haXJidXMtbWlsaXRhcnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Kazakhstan Defence Ministry’s state enterprise Kazspetsexport has awarded a contract to Airbus Military for the delivery of C-295 military tactical transport aircraft to the Kazakhstan Air Force.



Covering two aircraft, the contract is an implementation of the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed between the defence ministry and the company in March 2012, for the supply of a total of eight C-295 aircraft.



The contract also includes the related service support package for spare parts and ground support equipment.



Airbus Military Commercial head Antonio Rodriguez Barberan said the repeat contract reaffirms the Kazakhstan defence ministry’s confidence in the aircraft’s capabilities and cost-efficiency, as well as in the company.



”We will keep striving to ensure that we live up to this mark of confidence and stand by our customers for many years to come,” Barberan said.



Airbus has already handed over the first two C-295 to Kazakhstan Air Force this year, while delivery of the third and fourth is planned for 2014 and 2015, respectively.

""The contract also includes the related service support package for spare parts and ground support equipment.""

The delivery schedule of the remaining four aircraft under the MoU is scheduled to be defined over the coming years.



Powered by two Pratt & Whitney PW127G turboprop engines, the C-295 is a stretched derivative of the CN-235 transporter, and is designed to perform tactical airlift, search-and-rescue, and maritime patrol and environmental surveillance missions.



Capable of conducting short take-offs and landing on semi-prepared runways, the aircraft features a high-wing, rear-loader design that enables easy loading of mission pallets, passengers, cargo and litters for medical evacuation (MEDEVAC), communication and logistic duties or paratrooping operations.



Launched in 2001, the medium-sized tactical airlifter has been sold to Algeria, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, Finland, Jordan, Poland, Portugal and Spain.

Live Blogging the World’s Longest Flight on a Singapore A340-500 - Airline Reporter,"Thu, 10 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMy8xMC9saXZlLWJsb2dnaW5nLXRoZS13b3JsZHMtbG9uZ2VzdC1mbGlnaHQtb24tYS1zaW5nYXBvcmUtYTM0MC01MDAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"While I like to think I haven’t totally become an old man, most of the time my weekends these days involve chores and relaxing. But this week, when I get the usual “What are you doing this weekend?” question, I get interesting replies when I tell them I am about to fly about 50 hours and over 21,000 miles.

I am honored to have the opportunity to fly on the world’s two longest flights, which are both operated by Singapore Airlines and use the Airbus A340-500. After I take my less exciting flight from Seattle to LAX, I will board the world’s second-longest flight from LAX to Singapore (SIN). This flight (SQ 37) can be just over 18hrs and is 8,770 miles long.

I will be hanging out in Singapore for just about a day before boarding the Airbus A340-500 again to take the world’s longest flight, which is from SIN to Newark (EWR). It is about 9,500 miles and can be about 19 hours. For an average person this might not sound too exciting, but for me, I think this is going to be a great weekend and I want to share it in a unique way.

These are unique flights for a number of reasons. They use a rare aircraft, the Airbus A340-500, which is designed for ultra long-haul operations and there are not too many still left in service. The five planes that Singapore currently use are each configured with 100 Business Class seats in a 1-2-1 configuration; no first class, no suites, no economy, no problem.

Unfortunately, these flights are not going to last much longer either. SIN-LAX will be stopped on October 20th and SIN-EWR will cease on November 23rd of this year. Singapore Airlines already has other flights that are connecting the city pairs (although requiring stops) using the much-larger Airbus A380. The A380 out of LAX stops in Narita (NRT) before continuing to to Singapore and the A380 out of the New York area leaves JFK, stops in Frankfurt (FRA) before arriving in SIN. Although not non-stop, the A380 offers Suites, a bit wider Business Class seats and of course Economy.

Because these flights are going to soon be history, I want to cover the longest flight in a different way versus the other reviews I typically share. I plan to do a live blog during the entire flight from pre-boarding in Singapore to landing in New Jersey using the on-board internet. Of course issues might come up (i.e. the internet doesn’t work), but I will do what I can.

I will be doing this on SQ 22, which is scheduled to depart Singapore at 10:55am local time. This is 7:55pm on October 13th in Seattle (PDT) or 2:55am on October 14th Zulu/GMT. I will be landing in Newark at 5:50pm on the 14th local time. This is 2:50pm on the 14th in Seattle and 9:50pm on the 14th for Zulu/GMT. Yes, it can get confusing, but I should be live blogging for about 24 hours, so you can catch me here, @ARdpb, @AirlineReporter and our Facebook page.

My goal is to try to stay awake during the flight, but I hope that I am forgiven if a take a little nap. Hope you can follow along!

The European aerospace company said the airline had ordered 31 of its A350 XWB aircraft in a deal worth around $9.5bn at list prices. Japan Airlines has the option to buy a further 25.

It is a significant win for Airbus and the A350, which is designed to be more fuel efficient. The aircraft is a direct competitor of Boeing's Dreamliner, which has been bit by safety and technical issues this year.

Yoshiharu Ueki, president of Japan Airlines (JAL), said the A350 fleet would allow the company to take advantage of ""new business opportunities after slots at airports in Tokyo are increased"".

The new JAL Airbus fleet is scheduled to be operational from 2019, gradually replacing its ageing fleet over a six-year period.

Of the 31 aircraft ordered, 18 will be A350-900s, which typically offer three classes of seating and carry more than 300 passengers.

The remaining 13 will be A350-1000s, which seat 350 passengers on longer flights.

Fabrice Bregier, the Airbus president and chief executive, said the order marked a ""new chapter"" for the aircraft maker in Japan.

Airbus has now received orders for more than 750 A350s from 38 customers worldwide and it is hoped that the first of the new aircraft will be ready for commercial service in the second half of 2014.

News of the order was also welcomed by the British company Rolls-Royce, which will supply its Trent engine for all 31 aircraft.

In a separate announcement Rolls said it had won two contracts, with a combined value of up to $496m, to support T56 engines on US government aircraft.

Under the six-year contract the FTSE 100 company will supply parts and field and engineering support for thousands of T56 engines, which have been in production since the 1950s.

The contract, awarded by the Defence Logistics Agency, will support around 1,000 C-130, P-3 and C-2 aircraft in service with the US Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard and Customs and Border Control as well as international fleets.

Rolls was also handed a contract worth up to $90m by the US Navy, involving engine repairs for E-2 Hawkeye aircraft, which are powered by two T56-A-427 engines.

The five-year contract is renewable annually and is valued at $17m for the first year."

Boeing

Japan Airlines (JAL), a longtime loyal Boeing customer, will spend some $9.5 billion to buy between 31 and 56 A350 XWB jets from Airbus, it and the plane maker announced today.

The deal is a huge blow to Boeing for three key reasons:

It lost out on an order worth nearly $10 billion. It's a sign that seemingly endless problems with Boeing's 787 Dreamliner are pushing customers to buy the competing A350. Boeing is losing its grip on the lucrative Japanese market.

Japan's airline industry is well-established and still growing. In its most recent Current Market Outlook report, Boeing predicted that Northeast Asia (covering Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea) will need 1,360 planes in the next 20 years. The market is worth $280 billion.

Related stories

Boeing has benefitted from that business for decades, supplying 80% of Japan's planes. Until today, JAL had never bought a single plane from Airbus. No Japanese customer had purchased the A350.

But the most lucid explanation of what Japan means to Boeing comes from the planemaker itself, in a backgrounder document posted on its website (last updated in January 2013). Here's a key excerpt (emphasis ours):

Japan has long been one of the largest single-country international markets in dollar value for Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Over the past 50 years, Japanese carriers ordered approximately 900 Boeing jetliners. In the past decade, more than 80 percent of the airplanes ordered by Japanese customers have been Boeing products.

Japan is the largest market for Boeing twin-aisle airplanes. Japan as a country is also the single biggest customer for the 787. JAL has purchased more 747s than any other airline customer, and ANA is the largest international customer for the 767 family of airplanes. Together, Japan’s major carriers make Japan one of the largest international customers for the 777, with more than 100 ordered.

The country is especially important when it comes to the Dreamliner, according to the document. All Nippon Airways and JAL were the first two airlines to put the 787 into service.

The airlines aren't canceling their orders, but its clear JAL isn't thrilled with the 787.

In a statement, Boeing said, ""Although we are disappointed with the selection, we will continue to provide the most fuel efficient and innovative products and services that meet longer-term fleet requirements for Japan Airlines. We have built a strong relationship with Japan Airlines over the last 50 years and we look to continue our partnership going forward.""

Kostya Zolotusky, managing director of Boeing Capital Corp, was more blunt, telling Reuters, ""it's a heartbreak."""

In a move that indicates problems with the 787 Dreamliner are catching up with Boeing, longtime customer Japan Airlines (JAL) just placed its first order with Airbus, for 31 A350 XWB jets.

The A350 is a direct competitor to the 787 Dreamliner. The JAL deal, which includes options for 25 more jets, is worth $9.5 billion, according to The New York Times.

Both the A350 and 787 are made primarily of composite materials and offer a significant fuel economy advantage over previous designs, a major advantage for an airline industry that is beset by high fuel prices.

But seemingly endless problems have plagued the 787, and the JAL order is a sign that those issues have caught up with Boeing.

Related stories

JAL received its first Dreamliners in March 2012 with much fanfare, and now owns nine 787s, which it flies from Japan to destinations in the U.S., Europe, India, and Australia. The honeymoon did not last long.

In January 2013, JAL and All Nippon Airways (ANA) voluntarily grounded their Dreamliner fleets after an ANA 787 had to make an emergency landing due to a battery malfunction. The American FAA followed with a rare grounding order for the jets, which lasted several months.

Boeing introduced a new battery system and got the Dreamliners flying again, but other problems have surfaced. Norwegian Air has publicly complained about reliability issues, prompting Boeing to promise better product support, according to The Seattle Times.

JAL is not the only airline to place orders for both the 787 and A350: Air France, Singapore Airlines, and Lufthansa all plan to have both in their fleets. But that doesn't make the news easier for Boeing. ""It's a heartbreak,"" said Kostya Zolotusky, managing director of Boeing Capital Corp, according to Reuters.

In a statement, Boeing said it ""respects"" the airline's decision to buy from Airbus:

Japan's flagship carrier announced Monday it had ordered 31 A350 passenger jets from Airbus in a deal valued at $9.5 billion (7 billion euros).

The purchase agreement included orders for 18 long-haul A350-900s and 13 A350-1000s, with an option to buy another 25 jets in a drive to renew its fleet, according to Japan Airlines (JAL).

The deal followed an intense battle between the world's leading plane makers as Japan's two largest carriers sought dozens of new long-haul aircraft over the next decade.

The battle goes on

For several decades, US competitor Boeing had been able to ward off any attempts by Airbus to secure an order from JAL, benefiting from links with Japanese suppliers and deep political ties between Tokyo and Washington.

But delays to Boeing's 787 Dreamliner planes and their grounding after their batteries overheated had seriously tarnished the image of the US rival and cast doubt on Boeing's ability to deliver aircraft on time.

The battle for orders from Japan between the plane makers now looks set to shift to ANA, which is also looking for around 25 new jets to replace its aging fleet of long-haul Boeing 777s.

The sharklet ACJ319 now matches the range of the Boeing 737-700-­derived Boeing Business Jet, which is listed at 6,200nm (11,500km), Airbus says.

Airbus launched the sharklet program in 2009, delivering the first example of an A320 to AirAsia.

All A320 family ACJs will be ­provisioned for sharklets, but not as a standard item. Corporate jet customers will need to order it from a list of ­optional equipment.

The sharklet improves the fuel efficiency and the range of the aircraft, ­Airbus says.

Airbus

By obstructing high-pressure air under the wing from mixing with ­low-pressure air at the wingtip, the sharklet diminishes vortices that create drag. The effect makes the wing more efficient aerodynamically, allowing the aircraft to fly farther on the same load of fuel.

The sharklets on the ACJ319 improve range by about 200nm, Airbus says. Airbus is displaying a non-sharklet-equipped ACJ319 at NBAA. The aircraft, owned and operated by Comlux (booth 5927), features a unique cabin with two backrooms that can be configured as offices or bedrooms.

JAL makes first ever aircraft order from Airbus – Business Traveller - Business Traveller,"Tue, 08 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzdHJhdmVsbGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMTMvMTAvMDgvamFsLW1ha2VzLWZpcnN0LWV2ZXItYWlyY3JhZnQtb3JkZXItZnJvbS1haXJidXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Japan Airlines (JAL) has signed a purchase agreement with Airbus for 31 A350 XWBs (18 A350-900s and 13 A350-1000s), with the option for a further 25 aircraft.

This marks the airlines’ first ever order for Airbus aircraft, with JAL currently maintaining an all-Boeing fleet. The A350XWB is expected to enter into service from 2019, and will gradually replace JAL’s aging Boeing 777 aircraft.

Airbus’ fuel-efficient A350 is seen as a rival of Boeing’s B787 Dreamliner which has faced a number of technical difficulties since it began flying commercially in 2011, with one of the most recent incidents being with Norwegian Air (see story).

“JAL decided to replace [the] current Boeing 777s [with the] A350 from 2019 after the airline checked/evaluated in comprehensive ways various factors such as high safety, high quality of aircraft with long-time durability, the support from maker, economical as well as the period to replace our current aircraft,” Jian Yang, public relations spokesperson of JAL, said in a written response to Business Traveller Asia-Pacific's enquiry.

The seatplan for the new aircraft has not been confirmed yet but in a typical three-class layout, the A350-900 is able to seat more than 300 passengers on routes as long as 8,100 nautical miles (nm). The larger A350-1000 seats 350 passengers and can fly up to 8,400 nm.

The longest non-stop flight route in the world is flown by Singapore Airlines from the Lion City to Newark, measuring about 9,500 miles (8255 nm) or 18 hours and 40 minutes in flight length, although it will cease in November (see story).

The agreement also represents the first Airbus has inked with a customer from Japan for the A350, adding to a long list of orders that now totals 756.

Fabrice Bregier, chief executive of Airbus, said: ""This is Airbus' largest order for the A350 so far this year and is the largest ever order we have received from a Japanese airline.”

JetBlue deal marks 10 000th Airbus A320 family order - Skies Magazine,"Wed, 30 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZXNtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2pldGJsdWUtZGVhbC1tYXJrcy0xMC0wMDB0aC1haXJidXMtYTMyMC1mYW1pbHktb3JkZXIv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly9za2llc21hZy5jb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvamV0Ymx1ZS1kZWFsLW1hcmtzLTEwLTAwMHRoLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIwLWZhbWlseS1vcmRlci8_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Just days after taking delivery of its very first A321 aircraft, JetBlue Airways has placed a new order for 15 A321ceo (current engine option) and 20 A321neo (new engine option) aircraft. In addition, the airline has opted to upsize 8 A320ceo and 10 A320neo aircraft currently on backlog to 8 A321ceo and 10 A321neo, respectively. This order marks the 10,000th order for an Airbus A320 Family aircraft.

“We are pleased to convert some of our A320 positions to A321s, and order additional A321s to better match capacity with demand,” said JetBlue president and CEO Dave Barger. “The A321 is the ideal aircraft for our high density markets. In addition, a subfleet of the A321s will power our Mint premium service on the New York-Los Angeles and New York-San Francisco markets. It is the right aircraft for JetBlue’s lucrative routes. We eagerly look forward to the Sharklet retrofits and -NEO aircraft to further reduce operating costs.”

Since its launch in the 1984, the A320 Family has continued to evolve with the demands of the market, with the latest innovations being the A320neo and the Sharklets fuel saving wing tip devices. The A320neo features fuel-efficient new engines which bring enhanced range, and Sharklets which result in up to four percent reduced fuel burn. The A320neo is the fastest selling commercial aircraft ever, with some 60 percent of the market in sales. Nearly 2,400 NEO aircraft have been sold since the program’s launch.

“JetBlue launched its business with an all-Airbus fleet, demonstrating they are a forward-thinking airline,” said John Leahy, Airbus chief operating officer – customers. “The fact that they are turning to the NEO and larger Airbus aircraft overall makes it clear that they know how to please their passengers and maximize profits. In addition, JetBlue has always been a great partner in the Airbus Sharklet program and have been instrumental in our ability to launch the in-service retrofit option.”

This order marks, with JetBlue as a partner, the launch of the Sharklet retrofit program, which allows airlines currently flying A320ceo aircraft the option of optimizing their aircraft’s performance with the addition of Sharklets.

JetBlue will be the first airline in the world to take delivery of an aircraft from Airbus’ newest assembly facility, currently under construction in Mobile, Alabama. The facility will create 1,000 new jobs in the U.S. Gulf Coast region, and is part of the strategy to enhance Airbus’ global competitiveness by meeting the growing needs of its customers in the United States and elsewhere. Deliveries at the Mobile facility will begin in 2016. Airbus anticipates the facility will produce between 40 and 50 aircraft per year by 2018."
Flying Back to the Future Aboard the British Airways Airbus A318 - NYCAviation - NYCAviation,"Thu, 10 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55Y2F2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDEzLzEwL2EzMTgvMzA4MzbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When returning from London after the inaugural Dreamliner flight from Newark, I opted to try something different, and a Club World flight from London City is about as different as you can get. It combines modern comforts with just a taste of luxury travel from days gone by.

When aviation enthusiasts mention the flight number BA 1, the Concorde naturally comes to mind. That supersonic aircraft set the standard for luxury transcontinental passenger flight as it moved passengers between London and New York City faster than the speed of sound. Once the Concorde was retired in 2003, British Airways began looking for a new way of quickly getting premium passengers across the pond. The airline found an answer in an odd combination of an all-business class, 32-seat Airbus A318, London City Airport and a quick stop in Ireland. Welcome to Club World London City!

The experience starts right at the departure airport. London City Airport is about 6 miles from the center of the City of London as opposed to about 16 miles to Heathrow. City Airport is also directly connected to the city center and financial districts by the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) on the Woolwich-Arsenal line which begins in the heart of town at Bank station. The DLR was extremely easy to use, as multiple signs pointed me in the right direction. The DLR drops passengers off right at the entrance to City Airport, making this one of the easiest trips to an airport from a city center I’ve ever taken.

Once at City Airport, I went right past the check-in counters with boarding pass already in hand and proceeded to security, which had no line. Oddly, Club World flights out of City Airport are not compatible with mobile boarding passes, which really goes against the late check-in and arrival design of these flights. Passengers can check-in for London City Club World flights up to the last 15 minutes before departure (much like shuttle services in the Northeast U.S.), but they must still print out a physical ticket. I opted to check in exactly 24 hours in advance of the flight in order to snag a desirable seat. Prior to check-in, seat selection is only available for a fee which I was not about to pay. Thankfully, seating availability was wide open when I checked in.

After scanning my boarding pass at an automated entry barrier, I proceeded to security, which was delightfully civilized. Security personnel were cordial and swift, and in minutes I entered the departures hall. City Airport is tiny and quiet, an airport you would expect to find in a much smaller city, but certainly not London. I took a few minutes to roam the very quiet terminal, snapping a few pictures of the planes I passed along the way. I then made my way to the dedicated Club World gates, which is a bit of a walk down a hallway. Club World flights have their own dedicated waiting area and lounge, totally isolated from the rest of the terminal.

The lounge is at ground level, directly behind the two parked A318s, and provides a great view of the runway and passing aircraft. The lounge itself was rather small, but since the aircraft only seats a maximum of 32 passengers, nothing more is needed. There was a small refreshment area set up with drinks, snacks and some sandwiches wrapped in plastic which did not look entirely appetizing. Since my flight was boarding in just a few minutes, I decided against partaking in food and drink. Wi-fi is also provided free of charge by the airport, but requires offering up a large amount of personal information in exchange for the service. I opted to use what was left of my cellular data instead.

There is no jet bridge at City Airport, which I was particularly excited about. I don’t get to board a plane via air stairs very often, so I made sure I boarded first to get some clean shots of the aircraft from the ramp. Once on board, the crew gave a very warm welcome and was more than happy to let me sneak a few pictures of the flight deck in before I sat down in seat 2K. The A318 has a 2-2 configuration with only 8 rows of lie-flat seats, and they provide more than enough legroom and seat width. Because this was a daytime flight, I wouldn’t be doing any sleeping; for the return passengers, the seats don’t provide much privacy. The seats were very comfortable, and provided much more room and storage space than the Boeing 787 on which I flew to London. There were also multiple AC power ports to charge up devices. The two A318s in the London City fleet are also the only two British Airways aircraft in the fleet with connectivity, but it comes in the form of OnAir GSM roaming, and only those who don’t actually pay their own phone bill would want to use it.

The flight from London City Airport does not go directly to New York, but must first stop in Shannon, Ireland to refuel. Due to the weight of the aircraft and runway length, only a limited amount of fuel can be loaded at London City, and a fuel stop is necessary. The first leg of the fight is just over an hour, which is just long enough to get settled in and enjoy the first part of the meal service. An appetizer was served which choices of “Potter shrimp with Concorde lemon wedge” or “Basil and courgette parcel filled with ricotta.” I opted for the shrimp which was quite delicious and presented well. After a quick drink service, we started our approach into Shannon, something quite common for transatlantic flights back in the day, but unheard of in modern times.

Simply put, Shannon is a delightfully weird place. With old and partially scrapped aircraft littering the field, a seemingly out of place Transaero maintenance facility on site, and private jets everywhere, Shannon provides quite a bit of interesting scenery for an aviation buff. The stop in Shannon isn’t just a gas-and-go, however. Shannon holds a secret weapon that at times can be extremely useful. US Customs and Border Protection actually has a pre-clearance station at Shannon, meaning passengers technically pass through customs in Ireland and thus arrive at JFK as domestic passengers. For anyone without Global Entry privileges, this is a fantastic feature of Club World London City flights.

The stop in Shannon lasted only about 30 minutes, which was just enough time to clear customs and head to the restroom. The terminal features free wi-fi, and a small lounge area at the gate. Before I knew it, we were back on board and on the way to New York. The second leg of the flight is roughly 6.5 hours, which affords passengers much more time to settle in and relax. The two A318 aircraft do not have embedded in-flight entertainment screens (most likely due to the weight restrictions at London City), so flight attendants distribute iPads to passengers instead. The iPad, a first generation 3G model, comes in a case with a built in stand which can be propped up on the tray table. That solution, however, becomes problematic during meal service, as there simply isn’t enough room for the meal tray and the iPad at the same time. The iPad comes loaded with a decent amount of movies and TV shows, but not nearly at the level of typical embedded IFE. This solution is better than nothing, however.

For a flight with such a limited amount of passengers, there were quite a number of menu choices to pick from for the dinner service. Ranging from steak to chicken, to salmon and even risotto, I can’t imagine anyone not finding something appealing. I opted for the steak, which was served with “cottage fries,” vegetables and wild mushroom sauce. The steak was decent, but the fries were a bit soggy. Fries are a interesting choice for an in-flight menu, as there is virtually no chance they will end up crispy after being warmed up. Mashed potatoes probably would have been a better choice. Closer to landing, a traditional afternoon tea service was provided; that included snacks in the form of sandwiches, salted beef and macaroons.

Club World London City flights may not exactly have the same allure and fame as the Concorde, but they combines an unlikely set of features to provide the highest level of convenience that the Concorde once provided. Though we may not see supersonic travel again in our lifetime, the exclusivity and level of comfort of these flights are the next best thing.

Airbus clinches landmark order for 31 jets with Japan Airlines | Mint - Mint,"Mon, 07 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9Db21wYW5pZXMvbktRYWxreGtlR1pPaVBDdlk4RXB0Sy9BaXJidXMtY2xpbmNoZXMtbGFuZG1hcmstb3JkZXItZm9yLTMxLWpldHMtd2l0aC1KYXBhbi1BaXJsaW4uaHRtbNIBhQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vQ29tcGFuaWVzL25LUWFsa3hrZUdaT2lQQ3ZZOEVwdEsvQWlyYnVzLWNsaW5jaGVzLWxhbmRtYXJrLW9yZGVyLWZvci0zMS1qZXRzLXdpdGgtSmFwYW4tQWlybGluLmh0bWw_ZmFjZXQ9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Barcelona / Tokyo: Airbus announced its first jet order from Japan Airlines Co. Ltd on Monday, breaking open the last big aviation market dominated by Boeing Co. in a move that suggests the US company may pay for the 787 Dreamliner’s troubled debut.

The landmark deal for 31 wide-body A350 jets with a combined $9.5 billion list price follows an intense battle between the plane makers as Japan Airlines (JAL) and domestic rival All Nippon Airways (ANA) Holdings Inc seek dozens of new long-haul jets over the next decade.

The agreement, also a potential blow to a Japanese aerospace industry that builds large portions of Boeing’s jets, includes options for another 25 of the A350s.

“This is a huge win for Airbus and a big loss for Boeing,"" said aerospace analyst Scott Hamilton, managing director of Seattle-based Leeham Co.

“Airbus has been trying to break the wide-body monopoly of Boeing for decades and likewise Boeing has been wanting to keep Airbus out of JAL and ANA.""

Boeing has for decades seen off attempts by the European plane maker to secure an order with JAL, benefiting from links with Japanese suppliers and deep political ties between Tokyo and Washington to maintain a market share of more than 80%.

Delays to its 787 Dreamliner and its subsequent grounding after its batteries overheated have, however, tarnished its image and cast doubt on Boeing’s ability to deliver aircraft on time, industry experts said.

Both JAL and ANA are major Dreamliner buyers.

At the same time, bureaucratic and political influence over fleet purchases by JAL, which the government bailed out in 2010, has waned since it went public again a year ago and the democratic party government that rescued it lost power.

In a sign of how JAL’s once cosy government ties have become strained, the carrier on Friday complained that it was unfairly treated over landing rights at Tokyo’s Haneda airport after ANA received twice as many new slots.

Flying the flag

Airbus also showed its readiness to move in on Boeing’s turf in the Japanese aerospace industry, including cooperation in research and development.

“With this order, it gives us more momentum to look for potential joint research and development efforts for the future generation of aircraft,"" Fabrice Bregier, chief executive of Airbus, a subsidiary of EADS, told a joint news conference in Tokyo with JAL president Yoshiharu Ueki.

Ambassadors from Britain, Germany and France and the European Union representative attended the briefing, each with their flags displayed in front of them.

Ueki did not say what JAL would actually pay for the A350s, which vied with Boeing’s yet-to-be-launched 777X, but industry analysts said it would be typical to secure generous discounts in such a groundbreaking deal.

“This is seriously bad for Boeing. They need to do a little soul searching,"" said Richard Aboulafia, airline analyst with the Virginia-based Teal Group. “(The 787 issues) inevitably led to doubts about execution, resources and time.""

Ueki denied problems with the 787 were a factor in the decision, even as he repeated JAL’s apologies for disruptions to service caused by the plane’s grounding in January.

He attributed Airbus’s successful wooing of his company in part to timing: delivery for the A350, due to begin flying passengers next year, will ensure it is available when JAL needs it at the end of the decade while the 777X debut is further out and less certain.

JAL’s new Airbus aircraft, powered by Roll-Royce Holdings Plc engines, will begin entering service in 2019, the companies said.

As part of Airbus’s sales pitch, the aircraft maker invited Ueki to its base in the French city of Toulouse and gave the former pilot - whose career was limited to Boeing jets - a go in one of its A380 simulators. Ueki said he found the joystick control, which differs from the traditional stick found in Boeing jets, easy to use.

The deal and its impact on wide-body competition are likely to dominate a major aviation industry gathering in Barcelona this week.

Aging fleet

The battle between the two aircraft makers will now shift to ANA, which is looking for around 25 new jets to replace its aging fleet of long-haul Boeing 777s from 2020.

ANA is still gathering information on the 777X and the A350, Ryosei Nomura, a spokesman for the airline, said.

“This is Airbus’s largest order for the A350 so far this year and is the largest ever order we have received from a Japanese airline,"" Bregier said on a separate conference call.

Boeing, whose ties to Japan date back to the country’s post-war reconstruction, said it was disappointed but respected JAL’s decision.

“We have built a strong relationship with Japan Airlines over the last 50 years and we look to continue our partnership going forward,"" a company spokesman said via email.

If they chose Boeing’s 777X, both JAL and ANA would have to commit to being a launch customer again for a new Boeing jet.

Delays to the 787, which is one-third built in Japan, and its subsequent grounding may have made JAL wary of buying an aircraft that Boeing has yet to officially commit to building. That gave Airbus a rare opening in Boeing’s best market.

“It’s the price to be paid for passivity, by not launching this plane one year ago,"" said Aboulafia, referring to the 777X.

ANA’s boss, Shinichiro Ito, told Reuters last month that his airline would consider possible delivery delay risks when choosing replacements for its older long-haul 777 jets.

With the world’s biggest fleet of Dreamliners and the first to fly the innovative carbon composite plane, ANA has been most affected by delays and the aircraft’s grounding this year resulting in millions of dollars of losses.

Japanese suppliers including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd are expected to join the 777X programme, although Boeing has yet to say how much work they will get. REUTERS

"Airbus expects to sell more than 1,200 aircraft in 2013 - Aerospace Technology","Mon, 07 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9zcGFjZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LmNvbS91bmNhdGVnb3Jpc2VkL25ld3NhaXJidXMtZXhwZWN0cy1zZWxsLTEyMDAtYWlyY3JhZnQtMjAxMy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus expects to sell more than 1,200 aircraft this year, after beating its full-year target of at least 1,000 airliners in the first nine months.

This forecast comes after Airbus logged a number of pending orders from European airlines.

Airbus COO Customers John Leahy was quoted by Reuters as saying: ""We have an internal target of 1,200 orders but I think we could even do a little better than that.""

However, he said that no target had been set officially.

The announcement was made at an industry conference after Airbus secured a significant deal for its A350 XWBs from Japan Airlines (JAL).



JAL signed a $9.5bn deal yesterday with Airbus for 31 A350 XWBs, with an option for an additional 25 aircraft.

Between January and September, Airbus recorded 1,112 orders or a net total of 1,062 orders after adjusting for cancellations.

During the nine-month period, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 445 airliners.

""Between January and September, Airbus recorded 1,112 orders.""

The order cancellations included three A380 superjumbos of Deutsche Lufthansa which placed a €14bn order for wide-body Airbus A350-900 and Boeing 777-9Xs jets.

According to industry experts, Airbus could increase the size and add more seats to the already stretched A350-1000 in response to Boeing’s 777-9X, the revamped version of 777.

However, Leahy said that the European plane manufacturer has no plans to develop a larger A350-1000 in the near future.

In the recent years, Airbus and Boeing have been competing for orders in the ‘mini-jumbo’ segment for jetliners that seat between 300 and 400 passengers.

At an ISTAT industry conference in Spain, both the firms traded competing claims for their latest aircraft variants.

Additive manufacturing 'can lower aircraft building and operating costs' - TCT Magazine,"Tue, 29 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50Y3RtYWdhemluZS5jb20vYWRkaXRpdmUtbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy0zZC1wcmludGluZy1uZXdzL2FkZGl0aXZlLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmctY2FuLWxvd2VyLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWJ1aWxkaW5nLWFuZC1vcGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"× Expand Airbus A320 nacelle hinge bracket

Additive manufacturing can reduce the cost of building and operating aircraft.

This is according to EADS' research and technology arm Innovation Works (IW), which has been tasked with evaluating the use of direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) within the aerospace and defence sector.

Developed by 3D printer manufacturer EOS, DMLS is being used by EADS IW to manufacture demonstration parts to investigate the benefits of optimised design and production sustainability. Protection of the environment is a major driver for the organisation, while a reduction in the costs of manufacturing and operating its aerospace products also underlies the group's research.

The decision-making process for design and manufacturing solutions are heavily led by quality, cost and environmental effects, which is why EADS IW has defined new Technology Readiness Level (TRL) criteria focusing on sustainability.

A grand total of nine TRL processes must be passed at EADS before a technology can be qualified for use in production. For each TRL review, a technology's level of maturity is evaluated in terms of performance, engineering, manufacturing, operational readiness, value and risk. For each of these criteria, new components must out-perform their existing counterparts.

Testing sustainability and cost

The results from the initial EADS IW study of additive manufacturing were evaluated in terms of carbon dioxide emissions, energy and raw material efficiency, and recycling. When analysing energy consumption, the company's investigation included not only the production phase, but also the sourcing and transportation of raw materials, argon consumption for the atomisation of the DMLS metal powder, and overall waste from atomisation.

Amongst other things, an assessment by EADS IW highlighted the potential cost and sustainability benefits of DMLS during the operational phase in the redesign of Airbus A320 nacelle hinge brackets. The data was backed up by test results from EOS and, in an additional step, by test results from a raw material (powder) supplier.

In the first instance, cast steel nacelle hinge brackets were compared to an additively manufactured (AM) bracket of optimised titanium design by measuring the energy consumption over the whole life cycle. The technology turned out to be a good fit for the design optimisation, as for this application the operational phase is typically 100 times more important than the static phases (e.g. manufacturing the part).

A comparison was made between manufacturing the optimised titanium component by rapid investment casting and on an EOS platform. Energy consumption for the life cycle of the bracket, including raw material manufacture, the production process and the end-of-life phase, is slightly smaller on the EOS platform compared with rapid investment casting. The main advantage of the EOS technology, however, is that the additive process uses only the amount of material for manufacture that is in the product itself. Thus consumption of raw material can be reduced by up to 75 per cent.

The study focused on the comparison between DMLS and rapid investment casting of a single part and did not take into account the question of scalability, which has yet to be addressed. However, some impressive results were documented.

The optimised design of the nacelle hinge bracket allowed EADS and EOS to demonstrate the potential to reduce the weight per aircraft by approximately 10 kg – a significant amount in aviation. Carbon dioxide emissions as a result of the brackets were reduced by almost 40 per cent over their life cycle by optimising the design, despite the fact that the EOS technology uses significantly more energy during manufacture.

'Setting the standard for future studies'

Jon Meyer, ALM Research Team Leader at EADS IW, said: ""DMLS has demonstrated a number of benefits, as it can support design optimisation and enable subsequent manufacture in low volume production.

""In general, the joint study revealed that DMLS has the potential to build light, sustainable parts with due regard to our company’s carbon dioxide footprint. A key driver of the study was the integrated and transparent cooperation between customer and supplier, with an open approach that saw an unprecedented level of information sharing.

""The collaboration has set the standard for future studies involving the introduction and adoption of new technologies and processes. Even after the first positive results were evident, neither of the parties settled for the outcome, but continued to investigate options for further improvement.""

Part of the project's success was due to continued efforts towards further enhancements, evidenced by the swapping of the EOSINT M 270 DMLS machine for an EOSINT M 280 using titanium instead of steel, which led to additional carbon dioxide savings. The technology has the potential to make future aircraft lighter, leading to savings in resources which help to meet sustainability goals, without compromising on safety.

Meyer added: ""We see several advantages in the use of DMLS, mainly concerning freedom of design and ecological aspects. We can optimise structures and integrate dedicated functionality, in addition to which DMLS can significantly reduce sites' carbon dioxide footprints, as our study with EOS demonstrated.

""Furthermore, considering ecology and design together, optimised structures can result in reduced carbon dioxide emissions due to weight reduction. I see tremendous potential in DMLS technology for future aircraft generations, when it comes to both development and manufacturing."""
The longest flight in the world - CNN,"Sat, 19 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvd29ybGRzLWxvbmdlc3QtZmxpZ2h0L2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Story highlights World's longest nonstop flight (19 hours) linking Singapore and Newark canceled Veteran passengers, pilots and a sleep expert offer tips for ultralonghaul airline flights Many countries allow cockpit catnaps to stave off fatigue during long flights More twin-engine planes are flying long routes because of powerful, reliable engines

CNN —

Climbers conquer Everest. Runners complete the marathon. And globe-trotters master the ultralonghaul flight.

Amazing advances in technology now let nonstop flights fly farther and cheaper for airlines than ever before. Many follow routes that take them near the North Pole as they whip over the top of the globe to the other side of the world.

But these giant intercontinental leaps present their own challenges: How do passengers and pilots deal with annoying and potentially dangerous fatigue that comes with marathon air travel? How do twin-engine planes figure into the future of longhauls?

Let’s start with the king of nonstop flights: Singapore Airlines Flights 21 and 22 between Singapore and Newark, New Jersey. The route is the longest both in distance – about 9,500 miles – and in time – about 19 hours.

Business traveler Charles Yap is a big fan of this route because it avoids a connection in Germany, which he says saves six hours. All 100 seats aboard the flight are business class. Add hundreds of in-flight movie choices, and longhaul travel isn’t so bad for this Discovery Channel executive.

“If you’re stuck on a flight, you might as well enjoy it,” says Yap, 39.

His long-distance travel tips for surviving 19 hours aloft: “Walk around. Explore the cabin. Don’t force yourself to sleep.”

Ah yesssssssss, ssssssssslumber. Conversations with ultralonghaulers inevitably will turn to the subject of sleep. Specifically, avoiding jet lag.

“You should try on the day before to get on the same clock as your destination,” advises Chris Uriarte, 36, an American Express exec who’s flown the route about a dozen times.

“For long west-to-east flights – a day or two before you leave, start moving your bedtime earlier in the evening. For long east-to-west flights, try to delay sleep until late at night. Planning ahead makes you a lot more productive when you hit the ground.” Uriarte should know. He logs more than 200,000 flight miles a year.

Your seating position on the plane is “absolutely key,” to a good longhaul, Uriarte says. Singapore uses Airbus A340s with a spacious 1-2-1 seating configuration. The back two rows are even better with 1-1-1 seating.

In general, Uriarte recommends aisle seats in the center section. Sleeping is easier when “there’s no one climbing over you,” he says.

Seats behind the plane’s four wing-mounted engines will be louder, but some travelers enjoy being lulled to sleep by the jet noise.

‘Dr. Sleepgood’

Sleep is Curt Graeber’s business.

During his 19 years as Boeing’s chief engineer for human factors, pilots nicknamed Graeber “Dr. Sleepgood” because he helped them manage fatigue on longhaul flights. “Buy a seat that has a bed, and you’re fine,” Graeber says with a chuckle. (The price tag – often thousands of dollars – is the real challenge.) Sleeping in a coach seat is no easy feat, Graeber acknowledges.

Try to sleep at the time when your body is asleep, he says, although “that’s not always possible.” And avoid eating a heavy meal.

For the traveler, avoiding exhaustion is nice if you can swing it. For pilots, it’s critical.

Longhaul passenger tips –Don’t be a clock watcher –Wear loose clothing –Stretch your legs –Take off your shoes –Brush teeth every few hours to freshen your mouth –Use noise-canceling headphones, pillows, neck rests, moisturizer, eyedrops

Graeber ran a 1989 NASA/Federal Aviation Administration study that recommended allowing U.S. pilots to catnap in the cockpit – but only under supervision of another pilot. Cockpit napping is allowed for pilots in Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere. It’s been accepted by the International Civil Aviation Organization.

The FAA won’t allow it. “Longhaul flights require relief crews,” the FAA said in a written statement to CNN. “Rest is provided outside the cockpit. The FAA does not permit napping in the cockpit on U.S. air carriers.”

The FAA’s rejection of cockpit napping “doesn’t makes any sense,” Graeber says. “Everyone I talk to who uses it says it’s an important stopgap measure to improve safety and reduce sleep loss.”

National Transportation Safety Board investigators said they were concerned that pilot fatigue was a factor in July’s deadly crash landing of Asiana Airlines Flight 214, a Boeing 777 which caught fire on a San Francisco runway after a 10-hour flight from South Korea. The NTSB has not yet issued a final report on the reasons behind the crash.

International longhaul pilot Justin Schlechter says he’s seen the effects of flight fatigue firsthand. “It’s tough,” Schlechter admits. “It affects your reasoning surrounding your flying and the speed that your brain processes information.”

Schlechter predicts that the FAA eventually will reverse itself and allow cockpit catnaps. “The international standard allows it,” he says. “I think it’s safer to take a controlled catnap. I’m in favor of it.”

Here’s what U.S. longhaul pilots are allowed to do to manage fatigue:

Typically, during a 14-hour flight, the captain and first officer will fly the first three hours. Then, they hand off the plane to a second crew and get some rest in a special compartment – or in reserved seats in the passenger cabin.

During the cruise portion of the longhaul, pilots use various methods to keep sharp, such as checking fuel consumption and navigation, adjusting the ventilation, turning up cockpit lighting and engaging in energetic discussions with the other pilot.

Every three hours, the two crews will switch off command of the cockpit until about 90 minutes before landing, when the captain and first officer will land the aircraft.

Twin-engine longhaulers

So, those are some of the ultralonghaul challenges for humans. As for the machines – they have their own hurdles.

Obviously over vast oceans it’s critically important for airliner engines to be reliable and powerful. But hey, it’s a business, so the engines also have to be efficient enough to keep airline fuel costs low.

World record The twin-engine Boeing 777 holds the long-distance commercial airliner record. In 2005 it flew 13,423 miles from Hong Kong to London. Total time: 22 hours, 22 minutes.

Decades ago, that meant ultralonghaulers were likely four-engine planes, like the 747. In the unlikely event that an engine failed, the other three engines could power the plane the rest of the trip, no problem.

The downside: Four engines guzzle a lot of fuel.

“Now, engines are way more reliable,” says travel expert and former airline manager Brett Snyder of CrankyFlier.com. They’re also more powerful and fuel-saving.

That’s why Boeing’s twin-engine 777 Worldliner flies so many of the world’s longest nonstop routes.

In the coming years look for newer wide-bodies to fly more longhaul routes, like Boeing’s twin-engine 787 Dreamliner and the twin-engine Airbus A350 XWB. Both aircraft are made with superlightweight materials which also cut down on fuel costs.

Already, United Airlines has announced its Dreamliners will begin 14-hour nonstop service from San Francisco to Chengdu, China. British Airways plans to use the plane for a 10-hour nonstop from Austin, Texas, to London.

The FAA requires twin-engine planes to fly within close reach of a safe landing spot, in case of engine trouble.

Some travelers seem intrigued by the idea that an airliner can fly in a straight line with only one engine. “Wouldn’t the thrust from the engine be unbalanced and make the plane fly in circles?” they ask.

If a 777 lost one of its two engines, the plane has a computer that automatically adjusts the aircraft’s controls to compensate for unbalanced thrust. Pilots flying other airliners may have to manually adjust the plane to compensate.

How reliable are those engines?

“We’ve never seen an issue where a twin-engine plane has lost one engine during a transoceanic flight and can’t make it somewhere with the other engine,” says Snyder. “And engines almost never fail. With high reliability, airlines are free to look at economics and say, ‘Why would we have aircraft with four engines when we can have one that performs the same mission with two and save us money?’”

What killed the longest flight in the world?

In fact, money is exactly what’s being blamed for killing the longest flight in the world.

That’s right – after nine years of service, Singapore Airlines Flights 21 and 22 are scheduled for cancellation.

Snyder and most other experts suspect the airline got tired of dealing with poor profit margins on the fuel-guzzling four-engine Airbus A340. “They do use a ton of fuel, and that’s always painful,” says Snyder. “But the schedule advantage isn’t that great either when you fly so far.”

Also, the world’s second-longest nonstop – a Singapore Airlines 18-hour flight between Singapore and LAX – is scheduled to be canceled this month.

That will leave Qantas Flight 7, a Boeing 747 from Sydney to Dallas, atop the list of world’s longest nonstops by distance, at 8,600 miles. The longest nonstop by time will be Delta’s Flight 201 – a 777 from Atlanta to Johannesburg which clocks in at about 17 hours.

First, man stops going to the moon. Then the space shuttle stops flying. Then Concorde stops flying. And now this. Singapore Airlines Flight 21 passenger

Fans of the Singapore-Newark flight say they’ll miss its spacious seats and well-trained flight attendants.

On a Singapore passenger website, commenter Buster CT1K – tongue firmly in cheek – called the airline’s decision to cancel the flight a “very sad day in the history of aerospace and aviation. First, man stops going to the moon. Then the space shuttle stops flying. Then Concorde stops flying. And now this. I will miss the Newark-Singapore nonstop very much.”

The way Amex exec Uriarte sees it, for now, the airline industry appears to have pushed the longhaul envelope to the maximum.

“That’s about as long as we’re going to get,” he says. “The days of the 19-hour flight are over.”"
First A-400M aircraft rolls off production line in Seville - EL PAÍS USA,"Fri, 04 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5lbHBhaXMuY29tL2VscGFpcy8yMDEzLzEwLzA0L2luZW5nbGlzaC8xMzgwOTEzMzEwXzI3NjQ4OS5odG1s0gFcaHR0cHM6Ly9lbmdsaXNoLmVscGFpcy5jb20vZWxwYWlzLzIwMTMvMTAvMDQvaW5lbmdsaXNoLzEzODA5MTMzMTBfMjc2NDg5Lmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Military's A-400M assembly line in Seville. Julián Rojas

Conceived 31 years ago, the A-400M project finally took to the air at the end of last month when Airbus Military delivered the first of the new-generation transport aircraft to France. Now rolling off the production line in Seville, the A-400M is capable of carrying up to 30 tons of materiel, a mobile hospital with 66 beds or 166 personnel from Madrid to distant locations such as Nigeria or Greenland without refueling.

There are 173 more aircraft to assemble for delivery to countries within the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR), which comprises Germany, Belgium, Spain, France, Luxembourg, Turkey, the UK and Malaysia.

Airbus Military employs 2,700 people between Seville's San Pablo aerodrome and a plant in Tablada, a city suburb. Thousands of components arrive at San Pablo from around the world, fruits of the labor of 10,000 people in several, mostly European, countries. Work at San Pablo is guaranteed for the next two decades. ""We are working at full speed and will achieve the maximum rate of 2.5 aircraft a month in 2015,"" says Juan Silva, the chief manager of the final production line (FAL). ""There are currently eight planes in different phases.""

We're going at full speed to hit the top rate of 2.5 planes a month in 2015""

Although the A-400M project was initiated in 1982 to compete with the ubiquitous Hercules C-130 transport aircraft, it was not finally signed off until 2003. The assembly line was completed in 2007 and the first part to arrive through the giant doors, emblazoned with the nose of the plane — known as ""the whale"" because of its shape — was a wing, for testing.

Since then, five prototypes have been finished that have readied the assembly line to meet Airbus's order book. ""At the beginning we were more about engineering than production, with many people from European factories,"" says Silva, who prefers to talk about ""challenges"" instead of problems or setbacks. ""There have been many, but that's normal because of the complexity of the project. One example was finding a design that satisfied the requirements of seven different countries.""

The result is an extremely versatile aircraft that can reach 555.6km/h and has great range and capacity. Another significant achievement was gaining the A-400M a civil as well as a military license, which allows it to land at any airport in the world. Turkey will be the next OCCAR member to receive an A-400M, followed by Germany and the UK next year. The cost of the program is estimated at 31 billion euros, 21.5 billion of which has been put up by OCCAR states. It is hoped that 400 will be sold overall.

According to the Spanish Association of Defense, Aeronautic and Airspace Technology Companies, the sector will generate 53,000 jobs, 6.9 billion euros on annual revenues, and account for one percent of national GDP."
Japan Airlines Turn to Airbus for Long Haul Aircraft - Economy Class & Beyond - Kevin Marshall,"Mon, 07 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vZWNvbm9teWNsYXNzYW5kYmV5b25kLmJvYXJkaW5nYXJlYS5jb20vMjAxMy8xMC8wNy9qYXBhbi1haXJsaW5lcy10dXJuLXRvLWFpcmJ1cy1mb3ItbG9uZy1oYXVsLWFpcmNyYWZ0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In one of the most unexpected orders of the year, Japan Airlines have turned to Airbus for long haul aircraft, with an order for 31 aircraft.

The order will be composed of the new Airbus A350, made up of:

– 18 Airbus A350-900

– 13 Airbus A350-1000



Airbus A350-900 and A350-1000 flying in formation – Rendering, Airbus

Additional orders for 25 Airbus A350 aircraft are in the order as well.

Deliveries to commence in 2019 through to 2025, with a list value of US$9.5Billion. This is one of the biggest order of the A350 this year.

During its history, Japan Airlines has been pretty much been a solid Boeing customer, purchasing 747s, 767s, 777s and 787. Whilst Japan Air Systems brought A300s, this will be the first direct purchase of Airbus aircraft as Japan Airlines.

To Airbus, could this be the order that really pushes them into the land of the rising sun? Apart from a few smaller airlines using Airbus A320 family aircraft, none of the wide-bodies have shown major interest there (apart for an order of some A380s by one of the Japanese Airlines). Airbus seems picked the right plane at the right time, with the right timings to replace Japan Airlines fleet.

To Boeing, there are going to have to be questions asked. The relationship between Japan Airlines (and Japan) is a strong one with Japanese companies frequently contributing to Boeing products.

There’s another question to answer, and its in regards to the other major Japanese carrier – All Nippon Airlines. ANA’s 777 fleet is also aging, which will lead to a decision soon. Will ANA choose the A350XWB or Boeing 777X?

It could be the hurry-up that Boeing needs to formally launch the 777X.

Suffice to say, this is an order few expected (including yours truly – JAL’s fleet is solidly Boeing), and puts a lot more strength to the A350XWB project.

Senior officials from European aircraft producer Airbus said Monday its A330 regional, an updated wide-body A330-300 model for short haul trips, will help reduce airport and airspace congestion in China due to its economic size, in a move underlying the company's ambitions toward the second-largest aviation market.Compared with the current A330-300, the A330 regional model has a lower flying weight which leads to a significant reduction in operation costs.Meanwhile, the model, which is targeted at markets such as China and India, will have an increase in seats to 400, up from the current 300.""The updated A330-300 could help solve the problems of insufficient airspace, busy air traffic, and the shortage of pilots,"" Chris Emerson, the senior vice president for marketing with Airbus, said at the promotion meeting on Monday in Beijing.According to Emerson, China will also face serious airport and airspace congestion like the US and several European countries, and China's congestion will have a bigger effect in the short term.The top 20 airports in China will get saturated at the peak time in 20 years, Emerson said.Insiders regard the launch of the A330 regional plane as a sign of the competition between the world's two biggest airplane giants Airbus and Boeing.In June, Boeing unveiled a shorter-range and stretched version of its 787 Dreamliner called the 787-10, Reuters reported.Lin Zhijie, an independent market watcher, told the Global Times Monday that the wide-body aircraft of Boeing include the 787, 777 families and 747-8, targeting rival Airbus' A330, A350XWB series and A380.""Actually, only the A330 regional is specially designed for the short haul range in terms of the wide-bodies,"" Lin said.However, in a promotional meeting last month during the Beijing Airshow, Darren Hulst, Boeing's superintendent for the Northeast Asia market, questioned the fuel economy of the A330, citing the example of the routes between Beijing and Guangzhou, saying that the B787-9 results in savings of about 16.5 million yuan ($2.71 million) per plane annually compared to the A330-300, and 10 million yuan compared to the A350.Marc Allen, president of Boeing China, was cited by Beijing-based China Times newspaper in September as saying that the updated A330-300 could not be any different compared to the original one.In 2008, China had 80 short-haul twin-aisle airplanes flying daily, and the number has climbed to nearly 1,000 in 2013. Airbus' Emerson predicted that airspace in China will be reduced by 30 percent if only wide-bodied airplanes were used.The latest figures from Airbus showed that by the end of September, there were a total of 123 A330 planes operating in China, including 33 for China Eastern Airlines, 27 for China Southern Airlines and 15 for Hainan Airlines.Chen Juming, president of Airbus China, predicted Monday that it will not be a surprise to see the number of A330 planes in service doubling to 400 by the end of 2020."

The maker of E-Jets and the E-Jet E2 re-engined versions due beginning in 2018 listed its deliveries and backlog in its press release. Analysts expects 22 E-Jets would be delivered in the quarter. But the backlog is up 44% year-over-year, largely on the strength of the launch of the E2 (150 orders, 100 of which are for the smallest E-175 E2 and 25 each for the E-190/195 E2), and orders from Republic Airways Holdings and SkyWest Airlines for the current generation of E-Jets. The E-175 remains to most frequently-ordered airplane.

Although Embraer is expanding the size of the E-195-E2 by up to 12 seats, orders have been few. The E-190 has proved a better-selling model than the E-195.

Officials expect to have a healthy fourth quarter delivery stream.

Mitsubishi MRJ: Assembly for the first Mitsubishi MRJ Flight Test Vehicle (to borrow Bombardier’s term for the CSeries) is underway. The first delivery was originally planned for this year; it’s now planned for 2017, four years late. This rivals Boeing’s 787 and exceeds the Airbus A350 and as yet the CSeries.

JAL, ANA Politics: Reuters has an analysis about the suspicion politics may have been involved in the decision by Japan Airlines to buy the Airbus A350 and the pending order by ANA of an Airbus or Boeing airplane.

"Odds and Ends: AA, US and DOJ have mediator; new C919 order; A380 break even - Leeham News and Analysis","Tue, 29 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMy8xMC8yOS9vZGRzLWFuZC1lbmRzLWFhLXVzLWFuZC1kb2otaGF2ZS1tZWRpYXRvci1uZXctYzkxOS1vcmRlci1hMzgwLWJyZWFrLWV2ZW4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Movement on AA-US merger: Terry Maxon of The Dallas Morning News reports that American Airlines, US Airways and the Department of Justice have picked a mediator to sort out the DOJ’s lawsuit to block the AA-US merger. See also this Maxon report.

Maxon has a long piece, asking several pontificators (including yours truly) what they think the outcome will be.

Bloomberg reports that American CEO Tom Horton “sees a way” to a settlement but did not elaborate.

COMAC orders: COMAC says it received 20 more orders for the C919, but it once again is from a Chinese lessor, not an airline. A majority of orders for the C919 are from Chinese lessors, in stark contrast to standard practice among established lessors that they want to see a solid base (or a likely solid base) for a new aircraft type from airlines before signing up.

Although COMAC says this latest order brings the total up to 400, a data base shows only 275 so far (meaning the other 125 haven’t been converted to firm orders yet).

A380 Break Even: Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier says hitting break even on the A380 program in 2015, which is the current plan, will be difficult if deliveries fall below the target of 30 per year. Airbus should deliver 25 this year, he said.

DGCA to study Airbus A380 impact on airfares | Mint - Mint,"Thu, 24 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9Db21wYW5pZXMvTnZqeFF2bWczUUZFY3JqbGF0MmNVUC9ER0NBLXRvLXN0dWR5LUFpcmJ1cy1BMzgwLWltcGFjdC1vbi1haXJmYXJlcy5odG1s0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGl2ZW1pbnQuY29tL0NvbXBhbmllcy9Odmp4UXZtZzNRRkVjcmpsYXQyY1VQL0RHQ0EtdG8tc3R1ZHktQWlyYnVzLUEzODAtaW1wYWN0LW9uLWFpcmZhcmVzLmh0bWw_ZmFjZXQ9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New Delhi: The aviation ministry has asked the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to study the impact of allowing Airbus A380, the world’s largest passenger jet, on fares, even as it juggles long-pending requests from airlines such as Emirates , Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines to fly the aircraft to and from destinations in India.

Nine international airline firms operate the wide-body, double-deck jets that can seat as many as 525 passengers. The Airbus A380 has been barred from flying commercially to locations in India because of the view that it may stretch the existing infrastructure at Indian airports and undermine local airlines that do not have such aircraft in their fleets.

The matter to allow A380 into India was discussed at a meeting in the aviation ministry on Wednesday, which included officials of DGCA, Airports Authority of India (AAI) and Air India, according to a government official present at the meeting who declined to be identified.

It was decided that the aviation regulator will submit a study in less than a month that will look at two critical issues: the impact on other airlines flying the same routes that do not have the jumbo jets (because the A380 has more seats it could, potentially, charge less per ticket), and what it means for bilateral agreements that India has with other countries and which mention not the number of seats but the frequency of flights (which means that an airline choosing to fly the A380 could actually increase the number of seats).

At Wednesday’s meeting, Air India opposed the move to allow A380 saying it will affect local airlines, according to the official quoted earlier. “Nothing has been decided as yet. We will discuss with other domestic airlines also,"" the official said, referring to Jet Airways, SpiceJet and IndiGo, which also ply on international routes.

Foreign airlines welcomed the move.

Emirates said it is keen on bringing the A380 into India. “As India is a key market for Emirates, we are keen on bringing the A380 into the country, subject to these factors,"" a spokesman said in an email, referring to factors including passenger demand, airport capability and government permissions.

Lufthansa, too, said it was keen but added that all its A380s are already deployed and the ones coming in 2014 have also been earmarked for various routes.

“Lufthansa is generally interested to have the possibility to operate all of its aircraft to all of its overseas markets, including India, in order to meet changes in demand and serve the market needs best,"" a Lufthansa spokesman said in an email, adding that it had first made the request to fly A380s to India in 2008.

“Delhi and Bangalore are currently ready to handle aircraft and passengers of large aircraft like the A380 and the Boeing 747-8. In September, we have been able to introduce our second A380 route to China with a new flight to Shanghai,"" the spokesman said. “We have currently no additional aircraft available for any further routes for the near future.""

Airbus' Airline Appeal For Wider Plane Seats - Sky News,"Mon, 28 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5za3kuY29tL3N0b3J5L2FpcmJ1cy1haXJsaW5lLWFwcGVhbC1mb3Itd2lkZXItcGxhbmUtc2VhdHMtMTA0MzAxNTXSAVNodHRwczovL25ld3Muc2t5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9hbXAvYWlyYnVzLWFpcmxpbmUtYXBwZWFsLWZvci13aWRlci1wbGFuZS1zZWF0cy0xMDQzMDE1NQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Relief could be on the way for passengers crammed into narrow seats on planes.

Aircraft manufacturer Airbus is calling on the aviation industry to set a minimum seat width of 18 inches for long-haul aircraft.

The call comes after London-based research showed that sleep quality can improve substantially if seats are a little wider.

Airbus, whose planes' wings are made in the UK, already has an 18-inch minimum width in its long-haul economy cabins, with business and first-class passengers having wider seats.

The company said: ""However, other manufacturers are eroding passenger comfort standards by going back to narrower seat widths from the 1950s in order to remain competitive.""

Airbus released details of research conducted by Harley Street medical practice The London Sleep Centre.

Tests were done on a selection of passenger, which included monitoring brainwaves, and eye, abdominal, chest, hip and leg movement.

The tests revealed that a minimum seat width of 18 inches improved passenger sleep quality by 53% compared with the 1950s-style 17-inch standard.

Dr Irshaad Ebrahim of The London Sleep Centre said: ""The difference was significant. All passengers experienced a deeper, less disturbed and longer night's sleep in the 18-inch seat.""

Kevin Keniston, Airbus' head of passenger comfort, said: ""If the aviation industry doesn't take a stand right now then we risk jeopardising passenger comfort into 2045 and beyond, especially if you take into account aircraft delivery timetables combined with expected years in service.

""Which means another generation of passengers will be consigned to seats which are based on outdated standards."""
Big bird fails to take off: Airbus A380 sales slump - Sydney Morning Herald,"Thu, 24 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtaC5jb20uYXUvdHJhdmVsbGVyL2luc3BpcmF0aW9uL2JpZy1iaXJkLWZhaWxzLXRvLXRha2Utb2ZmLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLXNhbGVzLXNsdW1wLTIwMTMxMDI0LTJ3M2swLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Amid such concerns, Airbus is likely to take the opportunity to ""review the situation and strategy"" for the A380 at the end of the year, said an industry source who asked not to be named. Options include trimming production below the targeted 30 a year, taking a less pro-active stance on the jet and mainly producing what has been sold, and reviving plans to upgrade it beyond the end of the decade. Airbus declined to comment on any review, but ruled out straining its resources by building an unwanted jet. ""Regarding 2015, we have a few slots at the end of the year and we still work to try to fill them,"" said Tom Williams, executive vice president for programmes at the planemaker. ""Clearly we would want to keep A380 production around 30 aircraft per year as we have stated many times; however, we will never build 'white tails'. We are pragmatic and we will adapt production rates and our cost structure in line with demand: small variations are not a crisis.""

PRESSURE TO BREAK EVEN Analysts say that depending on its magnitude, a cut would be scrutinised for any impact on Airbus's target to break even on the A380 in 2015, though most investors are focused on the A350. Nick Cunningham of Agency Partners said Airbus may be forced to lower A380 costs more quickly than planned if it still wanted the jetliner to break even in 2015 while also cutting output. One way of easing pressure would be to bring forward planes scheduled for later delivery, though superjumbo production is significantly less flexible than on smaller jets. Williams said Airbus would look at making ""small advancements"" if needed. Airbus boasted the A380 would reshape aviation when it was launched in 2001, offering new comforts and lower operating costs. It sees a total market for 1711 very large jets over the next 20 years, much higher than Boeing's forecast of 760.

But the A380's birth was beset by technical and management rows, and sales fell abruptly when the discovery of wing cracks in 2011 hit momentum. Germany's Lufthansa recently reduced its A380 order by three as it bought smaller planes. But so far, some of the superjumbo's largest customers are not worried. ""For me, there will always be a market for a 500-plus seater,"" said Tim Clark, president of Dubai's Emirates. The airline has ordered a total of 90 A380s and does not see the arrival of slightly smaller twinjets - such as the Boeing 777X that it also plans to add to its fleet - as a threat. ""As the economy returns to a degree of normality, as it will, history tells us the rebound will be a lot faster and more aggressive than in previous decades, and this time next year we could be having a different discussion,"" Clark said.

GROWTH MODE In June, Airbus announced a marketing partnership with Doric Lease Corp, which provisionally ordered 20 A380s and is expected to finalise as early as next month. The same group is already a major A380 investor through financing deals with Emirates. ""The slow period of sales coincided with the great recession. I am aware of airlines that were going to take the aircraft but didn't because of the global economic slowdown,"" said Doric Lease Corp Chief Executive Mark Lapidus. ""I would say this is now changing because growth is coming back. We are now in a growth mode, not in a survival mode,"" he said, adding the group was talking to several airlines and sees ""significantly more orders for the plane in the next 12 months"". Slow sales are not the only headache, however. Analysts say the quality of the undelivered backlog has also deteriorated.

Airbus's 148 remaining undelivered orders for A380 include up to around 30 aircraft that analysts say may not get delivered, notably five for grounded Indian airline Kingfisher. Others include 10 for Hong Kong Airlines, which faces Chinese divisions over the jet, and six for Virgin Atlantic, which has negotiated cancellation rights. The backlog is also increasingly dominated by one customer, Emirates, which makes up a third - and well above 40 per cent if you exclude those orders considered least likely to be fulfilled by other airlines, according to a Reuters analysis. That comes as a mixed blessing for airline CEO Tim Clark, who says he is surprised more airlines had not ordered the jet. ""The last thing we want is to see the A380 marginalised,"" he said. It may, however, give the Dubai carrier a significant say in how the A380 will evolve, particularly whether the world's biggest passenger jet will get even bigger.

EMIRATES WANTS BIGGER A380 ""We have always been an advocate of stretching the airplane,"" Clark said. ""We have 37 in operation today, and on most routes a bigger plane would work quite nicely."" Airbus shelved its original plans for a second A380 version with 100 more seats when it became clear that the aircraft was not selling as quickly as it would have liked. But now, engine makers are bringing out new products to power Boeing's revamped 777 and the competing Airbus A350-1000, meaning some of the development needed to re-engine and potentially expand the A380 has potentially already been done. Some 60 years after the jet age began, reviving such a move could bring the world closer to an eye-popping 1000-seat megajumbo if others opted to fill it with all-economy seats. The current model is certified to hold 853 people in such a layout."
China Southern's Airbus A380 superjumbo touches down in Sydney - People's Daily,"Wed, 30 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKWh0dHA6Ly9lbi5wZW9wbGUuY24vYnVzaW5lc3MvODQ0MTU2Ny5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SYDNEY, Oct. 30 (People's Daily Online) -- China Southern’s first A380 Sydney-Guangzhou service touches down in Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport at 9:25 am on October 28, 2013. China Southern Airlines held a press conference to celebrate the successful arrival of this flight.



President and Chairman of China Southern Airlines, Si Xianmin said that China Southern is the world’s first airline to fly both A380 and B787 airplane. The A380 superjumbo underlines the airline’s commitment to Australia as one of its key overseas markets. China Southern Airlines will take this opportunity to enhance the cooperation with Australia, improve the quality of services and gradually make Guanzhou an exciting bridge connecting Australia with China, Asia, Middle East and Europe.



Consul General of People's Republic of China in Sydney Li Huaxin said, “Recently, Guangzhou applied the 72-hour visa-free transit policy. It’s predictable that personnel exchanges between Guangzhou and Sydney will be more frequent in the days to come. As China’s largest airline and the largest airline carrier between China and Australia, China Southern Airlines has built a stable and convenient air bridge for China-Australia economic and cultural exchanges. Today we have witnessed the first arrival of China Southern Airlines’ Airbus A380 in Sydney. This is more a starting point than a milestone. I’m convinced that China Southern Airlines will achieve greater accomplishments and further promote China-Australia relations from this new starting point”.



The A380 superjumbo service will replace the present CZ326 A330-300 service, which departs Sydney at 11.15 am and arrives in Guangzhou at 5.30 pm the same day. From December, China Southern Airlines will operate 48 weekly flights to the region, with plans to increase to 55 flights by 2015.



A Sydney Airport official estimates that a single daily A380 service from China has the potential to generate 5,000 jobs and contribute around AUD 39 million to the Australian economy over a full year. China Southern Airlines' upgrade from an A330 to a daily A380 is estimated to deliver an additional AUD 100 million in visitor expenditure to the NSW economy."
EVA Air takes delivery of an A321... with Sharklets! - Economy Class & Beyond - Kevin Marshall,"Wed, 23 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vZWNvbm9teWNsYXNzYW5kYmV5b25kLmJvYXJkaW5nYXJlYS5jb20vMjAxMy8xMC8yMy9ldmEtYWlyLXRha2VzLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LW9mLWFuLWEzMjEtd2l0aC1zaGFya2xldHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Continuing the theme of winglets on planes – or as Airbus calls them “Sharklets”, EVA Air becomes the second operator to operate the Airbus A321 (the stretched A320) with new Sharklets.

Those of you who have a keen eye will note this plane is not painted in EVA Air’s normal White, Green and Orange, but Star Alliance group colours – and it’s looking rather sharp for it – especially on the Sharklets.

EVA Air is leasing the aircraft from GECAS, and represents the first of eight sharklet equipped aircraft to join the EVA Air fleet.

Sharklets offer a 4% fuel saving on long-range flights – adding an extra 100 nautical mile range or an extra 450kg of payload to the aircraft.

A 4% reduction of fuel costs doesn’t sound a lot, but over time – this adds up, reducing the long-term fuel bill and hopefully keeps fares and cargo costs lower.

And no, it’s not painted in Hello Kitty titles. Try EVA Air’s larger A330’s or Boeing 777-300ER for that…

"Lower-weight A330 targeted at China, with its high dependence on widebody aircraft for trunk routes | CAPA - CAPA - Centre for Aviation","Thu, 03 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL2NlbnRyZWZvcmF2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS9hbmFseXNpcy9yZXBvcnRzL2xvd2VyLXdlaWdodC1hMzMwLXRhcmdldGVkLWF0LWNoaW5hLXdpdGgtaXRzLWhpZ2gtZGVwZW5kZW5jZS1vbi13aWRlYm9keS1haXJjcmFmdC1mb3ItdHJ1bmstcm91dGVzLTEzMTY1MdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus to offer regional/domestic A330-300 with cabin, not structural, changes

At the Aviation Expo China (Beijing Airshow) 2013, Airbus announced a lower-weight variant of the A330-300 that it is pitching for regional and domestic markets where there are large populations and traffic flow. The aircraft will seat up to 400 passengers on flights up to 3,000nm. Airbus expects the operating weight to be about 200 tonnes, a reduction of the baseline A330-300's 235 tonne operating weight. Airbus recently introduced a 242 tonne variant. The weight savings will be made through cabin changes, such as reducing galleys. Airbus says the lower-weight A330 will reduce operating costs by up to 15%. This includes reductions on landing fees, typically based on aircraft weight, and associated charges, like de-rated engines.

There is a history for domestic or regional versions of widebody aircraft. In the 1990s Boeing manufactured a domestic version of its 747-400 for key customers All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines. JAL has since retired all of its 747s while ANA has a handful of domestic 747s due for imminent retirement. But Boeing's domestic 747 had structural changes and not just the cabin ones Airbus is promoting. Boeing's changes included strengthening the undercarriage to support the higher number of cycles the 747 domestics would accumulate, and removing the winglets. Boeing also removed the upper deck galley to provide room for additional seats. The 747-400 domestic could be converted to a regular 747, just as Airbus plans for the lower-weight A330 to be converted for long-haul use. (The conversion will theoretically be easier than on the 747, although no domestic 747s were ever converted.)

De-rating engines is common. Examples include Singapore Airlines de-rating the engines on its 777-200 used on regional routes while Qantas has de-rated the engines on A330s used domestically.

China's domestic carriers have already reduced galley space on their domestic A330s while long-haul low-cost carriers have also reduced galley space to save weight. Scoot, which uses 777-200s formerly used by SIA, estimates it saved two tonnes on its 777-200s by reducing galleys, using lighter seats and removing embedded IFE.

China operates 119 A330s, but most of them -200s

Airbus announced the lower-weight A330 in China, home to the largest number of A330s. There are 119 passenger A330s in service in China as of Oct-2013, according to CAPA's Fleet Database. Air China has the most with 39 followed by China Eastern (33), China Southern (26), Hainan Airlines (15) and Sichuan Airlines (5). The majority - 62% - of A330s in China are the -200 variant, and typically used on long-haul flights to Europe and even North America. All Chinese A330 operators have more -200 variants than -300s.

Summary of A330s with Chinese airlines: 02-Oct-2013

The 45 A330-300s still represents a substantial market that could grow or be replaced, and this excludes other markets like Singapore and Hong Kong where there are sizeable regional fleets. By not making structural changes to the A330, Airbus' lower-weight A330-300 is a low-cost variant that Airbus can expect to quickly become profitable.

China Southern was the first A330 operator, taking A330s in 2005. (In the chart below, one of Sichuan Airlines' A330s was manufactured in 2002 but for a non-Chinese carrier. Sichuan acquired the aircraft only in recent years.) Since 2006 Chinese carriers have collectively taken about 16 A330s a year, except in 2009, which was incidentally after a disastrous financial performance across the board. The peak was in 2007 with 19 A330s manufactured that year for Chinese carriers.

Widebody aircraft are gaining market share

Widebody aircraft are gaining marketshare on China's top five domestic routes as of Oct-2013.

Notably these routes all involve airports with constrained slots, Beijing Capital and Shanghai Hongqiao especially. The top route is Beijing-Shanghai, with another three top routes from Beijing and one from Shanghai.

Top five domestic routes in China ranked on seat capacity: 30-Sep-2013 to 6-Oct-2013

The importance of widebodies is most apparent on the Beijing-Shanghai route, the largest by far. It is the route between the country's two largest cities - and also its most constrained airports. Widebody aircraft fly 76% of frequencies.

Widebodies have gained share in other markets, except Shanghai Hongqiao-Shenzhen, but these figures are distorted as most Shenzhen-bound flights departed from Shanghai Pudong until the middle of the last decade.

Widebody and narrowbody aircraft share of China's top five domestic routes: 2003 compared to 2013

The increasing share of widebodies on frequencies is especially notable given the overall rise in frequencies. Shanghai Hongqiao-Shenzhen figures are distorted as most Shenzhen-bound flights departed from Shanghai Pudong until the middle of the last decade.

Widebody and narrowbody frequencies on China's top five domestic routes: 2003 compared to 2013

A330 is the key widebody in the domestic market

Within widebody frequencies, it is the A330 that has come to dominate. The A330 alone operates more than half (53%) of all Beijing-Shanghai Hongqiao frequencies. The A330 has the largest widebody share in all of the top five markets except Shanghai Hongqiao-Shenzhen, where China Eastern uses its old A300s.

With Shenzhen being a lower-yielding market compared to Shanghai-Beijing, it is logical for China Eastern to deploy its less desirable fleet on that market. A330s could be expected to take over the A300 sectors once the A300 is retired.

Distribution of aircraft type frequencies on top five domestic Chinese routes (as of Oct-2013): 2003-2013

The up-gauging trend is also apparent within the narrowbody sector. It is also notable that where the A320 family is present, it is typically the A321 variant (the largest in the family) that is most prolific. The A321 operates 69% of all A320 family frequencies on Beijing-Chengdu, 59% on Shanghai Hongqiao-Shenzhen, 66% on Beijing-Shanghai Hongqiao, and 99% on both Beijing-Guangzhou and Beijing-Hongqiao.

The trend is also apparent on the Boeing side, where the 737-900 (the largest variant of the 737 in China) operates 52% of Beijing-Shenzhen services.

Lower-weight A330-300 could find a home in other markets too

It is not just mainland China where the lower-weight A330-300 can have a future. Cathay Pacific and Dragonair are the world's largest operators of the A330 with 56 in service (all -300s), according to CAPA's Fleet Database. Some are used on long-haul flights to Australia (which would be out of the lower-weight A330's range) but many are on regional sectors.

Likewise at Singapore Airlines, which has 24 A330-300s that are used regionally but also on some Australia services. Thai Airways has 26 A330-300s. Another notable short/medium-haul operator is China Airlines with 22 A330-300s. Qantas operates a sizeable number of A330s domestically, but these are the -200 variant.

A separate short-haul version of the A330-300 could reduce operational flexibility at SIA, for example. SIA has a single configuration for its A330-300s whereas Cathay and Dragonair have different long-haul and short-haul configurations. So there it would be easier to slot in the lower-weight A330-300 as the fleet is already segregated. But at SIA and others the challenge is not insurmountable, especially considering the cost savings.

From Hong Kong and Singapore the lower-weight A330-300 would reach most of Asia, based on Airbus' range estimate.

Outlook: powering growth in absence of airport slots

The lower-weight A330-300 should be especially popular in Asia.

Here the rapid growth rates are typically outstripping the ability of infrastructure providers to keep up. The problem is made worse in many areas because much of the growth has been on narrowbody equipment, as LCCs permeate the market (accounting for nearly 60% of all seats in southeast Asia - up from zero a decade ago). Airport capacity is constrained to such an extent in some cases that additional slots may not be available until the end of the decade or into next decade.

For mainland China, the rise of suitable widebodies - and the lower weight A330 is a positive step - promises the potential to expand, despite these infrastructure limits."
JAL Picks Airbus A350 Over Boeing Dreamliner - Sky News,"Mon, 07 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5za3kuY29tL3N0b3J5L2phbC1waWNrcy1haXJidXMtYTM1MC1vdmVyLWJvZWluZy1kcmVhbWxpbmVyLTEwNDMyMjQw0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLnNreS5jb20vc3RvcnkvYW1wL2phbC1waWNrcy1haXJidXMtYTM1MC1vdmVyLWJvZWluZy1kcmVhbWxpbmVyLTEwNDMyMjQw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Japan Airlines has signed its first-ever purchase from Airbus, in a blow to Boeing as the Dreamliner saga continues to affect the American firm.

JAL announced a decision to buy 31 A350 planes, with a catalogue value of £5.9bn.

The deal signed in Tokyo on Monday also includes an option for JAL to buy 25 more Airbus jets.

JAL's fleet has historically been dominated by Boeing, partly because of the defence and security ties between the two countries and reconstruction arrangements after the Second World War.

Image: In July an Ethiopian Airlines plane suffered fire damage at Heathrow

The deal was announced after markets closed in Tokyo but investors cheered reports of the purchase earlier on Monday as JAL's shares closed up 3%.

The push by the European plane maker comes as JAL and domestic rival All Nippon Airways (ANA) - whose fleet is also dominated by Boeing - have been sideswiped by problems with the next generation Dreamliner.

The lightweight plane, hailed for its fuel-efficiency but marred by years of production delays, was grounded globally in January after lithium-ion batteries overheated on two different planes, with one of them catching fire while parked.

The Japanese carriers - the single biggest operators of the Dreamliner -- have put their fleets back into service but they are seeking compensation from Boeing of more than $200m (£120m) amid a global grounding of the model.

""Considering the recent troubles with the Dreamliner, JAL may have reached the conclusion that it wants to avoid the risks,"" SMBC Friend Research Center senior analyst Mitsuru Miyazaki said.

""The aviation sector is a global industry so it's natural that Japanese airlines want to secure multiple sourcing options for their planes.""

But JAL president Yoshiharu Ueki denied the decision to turn to the European manufacturer for replacements for Boeing jets was related to the problems that have plagued the rival 787 Dreamliner.

Months of problems with Dreamliner fleets have eased recently, however Poland's LOT grounded its fleet in September over missing fuel filters.

The Scandinavian carrier Norwegian Long Haul also reportedly replaced one of its two 787s with a leased Airbus after the Boeing aircraft broke down six times last month.

Airbus said its next-generation A350 is 25% more fuel-efficient than its existing wide-bodied aircraft and has an order book approaching 800 planes."

Coach seating is getting even worse - Boing Boing,"Sun, 27 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vYm9pbmdib2luZy5uZXQvMjAxMy8xMC8yNy9jb2FjaC1zZWF0aW5nLWlzLWdldHRpbmctZXZlbi5odG1s0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly9ib2luZ2JvaW5nLm5ldC8yMDEzLzEwLzI3L2NvYWNoLXNlYXRpbmctaXMtZ2V0dGluZy1ldmVuLmh0bWwvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

Uh-oh: airlines ordering new Dreamliner 787s and Airbus A330s are asking to have them fitted with 16.7""-wide coach seats, a new low for long-haul travel. These are planes intended for intercontinental flights — six to 14 hours! — and they're shaving the armrests, squeezing the seats, and otherwise cramming in ways that beggar the imagination. The airlines say it'll all be OK — they'll just distract you from your terrible circumstances with big meals and TV.

Of the airlines that have bought Boeing Co.'s new 787 Dreamliner—a model touted as improving passenger comfort—90% have selected nine-abreast seating in coach over roomy eight-abreast. And 10 airlines around the world now fly narrower Airbus A330 jetliners with nine 16.7-inch seats in each row—among the tightest flying—rather than the eight it was designed for, according to the unit of European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co. EADSY +2.04%

The new trend in economy seating reverses a half century of seat growth in economy class. Early jet planes like Boeing's 707 had 17-inch seats, a dimension based on the width of a U.S. Air Force pilot's hips, says Airbus marketing chief Chris Emerson.

That standard for long-haul flying increased to 18-inches in the 1970s and 1980s with the 747 jumbo and the first Airbus jets. It widened to 18.5 inches with the Boeing 777 in the 1990s and A380 superjumbo in the 2000s. Now, cost-conscious airlines are moving to lighter 17-inch-wide seats on their Boeing 777 and 787 Dreamliners and 18-inch seats for A350s."

Baker was speaking at an event in Doha on Tuesday to announce Qatar Airways has become a full member of the Oneworld airline grouping, becoming the only major Gulf carrier to join a global alliance.

""From its first flights tomorrow (Wednesday) morning ... Qatar Airways will be offering Oneworld?s full range of services and benefits,"" the airline said Tuesday.

Qatar Airways is the second Middle Eastern carrier -- after Royal Jordanian -- to join the alliance founded in 1998 by American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific and Qantas.

""Becoming a member of Oneworld is one of the most significant landmarks in Qatar Airways? history,"" said Baker.

""It will strengthen our competitive offering.""

Oneworld is one of three major airline groupings, alongside Star Alliance and SkyTeam.

The carrier serves more than 130 destinations in 70 countries. It has a fleet of 130 aircraft and has orders and options for more than 250 new planes in the next few years.

Wealthy gas producer Qatar has made huge investments in infrastructure to establish itself as an international hub before it hosts the football World Cup in 2022."

New Airbus for MEA. Ten more aircrafts will be delivered by 2021 - Lebanon - Businessnews.com.lb,"Fri, 04 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHA6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NuZXdzLmNvbS5sYi9jbXMvU3RvcnkvU3RvcnlEZXRhaWxzLzM0NTUvTmV3LUFpcmJ1cy1mb3ItTUVB0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The national flag carrier Middle East Airlines (MEA) received a new ‘Airbus 320’ aircraft on September 3. MEA now operates a fleet of 17 aircrafts.



Last year, MEA signed a new agreement with leading aircraft manufacturer Airbus to acquire ten more planes (Airbus 321, 320) for around $1 billion to boost its fleet.



Two aircrafts will join the MEA fleet in 2018, followed by another three in 2019, three in 2020, and two in 2021. Four current Airbus 321s and 4 Airbus 320s will be decommissioned.



The new additions to the fleet are part of MEA’s expansion plan to reach more destinations.



The new plane holds the airline alliance SkyTeam symbol. MEA is the 17th Sky Team member, and its second member from the Middle East region. Joining SkyTeam allowed MEA to expand its global reach and offer passengers more destinations worldwide.



MEA customers can earn and redeem miles on services operated by all SkyTeam member airlines."
Airbus v Boeing Japan battle switches to ANA - Times of Malta,"Tue, 08 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZm1hbHRhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy92aWV3L0FpcmJ1cy12LUJvZWluZy1KYXBhbi1iYXR0bGUtc3dpdGNoZXMtdG8tQU5BLjQ4OTU4MdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Stung by the loss of a multibillion dollar jet order from Japan Airlines to arch-rival Airbus, Boeing will mount an all-out defence of its position with Japan’s other major airline, ANA, a source close to the US planemaker said.

Boeing executives are still trying to understand why long-time customer JAL ordered 31 Airbus A350s – worth $9.5 billion at list prices – in a deal, announced on Monday, that was the US company’s first major loss in Japan.

ANA Holdings Inc wants around 35 aircraft to replace its long-haul Boeing 777s and, like JAL, is considering both the A350 and the Boeing 777X, the re-engined, updated variant of the popular long-range wide-body jet.

After the JAL setback, ANA is fast becoming a “can’t lose at any cost” deal for Boeing, whose executives are under pressure to “do everything they can” to win the deal, said an industry source close to the US planemaker.

The good thing in Japan is that when they commit to a time, they tend to stick to that

The US’ close diplomatic ties with Japan, a key US ally in East Asia, could help Boeing’s cause, according to industry sources.

The US company’s relationship with Japanese industrial giants Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Fuji Heavy Industries, which collectively make around 35 per cent of Boeing’s 787 and are major suppliers for its other aircraft, is another factor that could work it its favour at the political level.

Boeing declined to comment on its ANA strategy.

Despite Monday’s victory, Airbus is widely seen as the underdog in the tussle for ANA’s business, industry experts say.

Apart from JAL, the European firm has secured marquee airlines such as Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Qatar Airways and Emirates Airline as A350 customers.

ANA does operate a handful of Airbus A320s on its short-haul network, but its long-haul fleet comprises only Boeing aircraft. It was the launch customer for the troubled Boeing 787 and is still the largest operator of the Dreamliner.

The airline has said that it could make a decision in early 2014, and analysts expect it to stick to that schedule.

“The good thing in Japan is that when they commit to a time, they tend to stick to that,” said a second industry source, who added that it was going to be a “very busy end of the year and a very busy start to the new year” for both companies.

ANA’s boss, Shinichiro Ito, told Reuters last month that the airline would factor in the risk of a delay in the delivery of the aircraft into its decision.

That would appear to be a reference to the delays to the 787 Dreamliner and its subsequent grounding after batteries overheated.

The Dreamliner’s problems tarnished Boeing’s image and cast doubt on its ability to deliver aircraft on time, aviation experts say.

Lufthansa is the first customer for the 777X, with an order for 34 aircraft last month, and the high-density 777-9X variant that can seat up to 400 passengers has received interest from several Gulf carriers.

The plane, which will have new engines and wings that give it a greater range than the existing 777-300ER, could be launched later this year and enter into service around 2020. ANA has received several briefings on both the A350 and the 777X in recent months, and an airline spokesman said that information was still being gathered.

The Japanese airlines are proving to be tough customers for both companies, sources said, asking a lot of questions about the performance of both aircraft.

Airbus may have a slight advantage as the first A350 variant, the -900, had its first flight in June.

The data from those tests flights is being used to confirm the information that Airbus has been giving prospective customers.

By the time the first A350 reaches JAL in 2019, the A350 would be a mature aircraft programme with deliveries scheduled to begin in late 2014.

The 777X, meanwhile, remains a concept that has not been launched. Uncertainty about its delivery schedule and performance, especially after JAL’s decision, means that Boeing executives must build a stronger case, said the source close to the company."

"Airbus and Japan Airlines agree landmark US$9,5bn deal - Namibian","Tue, 08 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hbWliaWFuLmNvbS5uYS9haXJidXMtYW5kLWphcGFuLWFpcmxpbmVzLWFncmVlLWxhbmRtYXJrLXVzOTVibi1kZWFsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"AIRCRAFT manufacturing giant Airbus has announced its first deal with Japanese carrier Japan Airlines (JAL). It has won an order from JAL for 31 of its A350 planes, in a deal worth nearly US$9,5bn (£5.9bn) at list prices.

The A350 is designed to be more fuel efficient and is a direct competitor to US rival Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner, which has been hit by safety and technical issues in recent months. The deal is a blow for Boeing, which has dominated Japan’s aviation market.

“This is Airbus’ largest order for the A350 so far this year and is the largest ever order we have received from a Japanese airline,” said Fabrice Bregier, chief executive of Airbus.

“I must say that achieving this breakthrough order and entering a traditional competitor market was one of my personal goals.” According to the deal, JAL also has an option to purchase an additional 25 planes. In recent years, the aviation industry has been hurt by a slowdown in demand and high volatility in global fuel prices. That has seen many leading carriers turn to more fuel-efficient aircraft in an attempt to cut down costs and maintain profitability. Both Airbus and Boeing have seen a surge in demand for such planes. Airbus, which says the A350 will use about 25 percent less fuel than previous generation wide-bodied aircraft, has had 725 orders for the plane prior to securing the JAL deal. The company hopes to start delivering the first A350s to customers by the end of 2014. Yoshiharu Ueki, president of Japan Airlines, said the new planes would offer “high level of operational efficiency and product competitiveness” and help the airline to cater to “new business opportunities after slots at airports in Tokyo are increased.”

Meanwhile, Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner continues to remain popular despite this year’s temporary worldwide grounding of the aircraft while safety regulators investigated the cause of fires. The firm has received orders for more than 950 Dreamliner jets so far. Japanese carriers, JAL and All Nippon Airways (ANA), are two of the biggest operators of the Dreamliner jets. – BBC"

The new aircraft that made its maiden trip to Windhoek from Frankfurt is one of two planes being leased by Air Namibia from U.S. lessor company Intrepid Aviation in a deal that will save the national airline N$8.5 million per month in fuel costs. Together it brought celebrations as a result of the excellent European partnership involving France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain. Speaking at the delivery ceremony of the first of the two Airbus A330-200 aircraft, the Deputy Minister of Works and Transport, Killus Nguvauva, said with the huge investment made to acquire the Airbus A330-200, the government and the people of the country are vigorously watching and following whatever is happening at Air Namibia, and they want to see tangible results. He said air transport is an important driver and enabler of the socio-economic development of a country through facilitating trade and tourism. “I wish to remind management and staff of Air Namibia that you are operating in a highly competitive industry, and while we acknowledge that you face various challenges, there is an expectation from the shareholder and the nation that you manage this institution prudently and diligently, and that you will attain and fulfill the objectives and goals for which Air Namibia was established,” said Nguvauva. Among the invited guests were Vincent Tchengang, Airbus sales director, Hadi Akoum, Airbus vice-president sales for Africa and Tomas Schmidt from Intrepid Aviation. Nguvauva said he was pleased to see many stakeholders present at the ceremony as the business of the national airliner requires partnerships and shared responsibilities between key players. “It is through forcing such partnerships with key aircraft manufacturers, that our national airline will be able to continue growing its business,”he added. German Ambassador accredited to Namibia, Onno Huckmann, said he hoped the new Airbus acquisition would significantly contribute to the strengthening of Air Namibia and its improved economic performance. “With the help of its skilled crew, may this plane cover millions of air miles in future and transport countless passengers safely from one continent to another. May this Airbus A330-200 be blessed and always have a smooth landing,” he gave his blessings. French Ambassador to Namibia Jacqueline Bassa-Mazzoni said Air Namibia with its four Airbus 319 aircraft and the new Airbus A330-200 is already one of the most modern companies in Southern Africa. “Not only because Air Namibia and Airbus have established a very good relationship, but the new aircraft reflect the ongoing concerns of the Namibian authorities of modernizing its fleet and reinforcing the security of its passengers,” she said.

PLANS to construct a new building at Airbus for the loading and unloading of the Beluga aircraft will be ruled on next week.

The proposal, which would create around nine jobs, will provide a weatherproof facility for off-loading and storing wings.

The application for the Beluga Line Station also includes an attached three-storey building to provide staff and office facilities.

The 5,000 metre square facility would be built on the Airbus site replacing a car park, access road and some open grassland.

The Airbus application states: “Airbus aircraft wings manufactured at the Broughton site would be transferred from the production hangars to the external racks where they would be held for short term storage.

“They would then be transferred into the Beluga Line Station and either loaded directly into a waiting Beluga aircraft or transferred to the internal wing racks pending arrival of the Beluga aircraft.

“Tooling jigs would be off-loaded from the Beluga and either stored on the internal or external racks or taken direct to the production hangars.”

The operational hours for the facility would be 6am-12pm Monday to Friday, 6am-9pm Saturday and 8am-6pm on Sunday.

The ground floor of the building attached to the Beluga Line Station would house the mechanical and electrical plant equipment.

The first and second floors would provide an office, meeting/briefing room, kitchen, and locker and drying rooms for staff. There would also be a separate welfare facilities for the Beluga plane crew.

There have been no objections to the application.

Flintshire council's head of planning Andrew Farrow has recommended the facility for approval subject to conditions, saying it “would consolidate and safeguard growth of the site”.

One of the conditions attached to the plans is to replace the 500 car parking spaces which would be lost. A separate application has been made for a new parking area.

Councillors meet on Wednesday at County Hall to rule on the plans."

The centre to be located adjacent to the Sepang Aircraft Engineering (SAE) facility represents an expansion of the manufacturer’s global network of offices providing 24/7 specialised major aircraft engineering and repair services.

Existing offices offering these services are located in Toulouse, Hamburg, Wichita and Beijing.

Speaking at the construction of a second hangar at the SAE facility here yesterday, Najib said Malaysia is among the three leading countries in the Asia Pacific for maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) centre for services.

The hanger is a joint venture between Airbus and SAE, and marking an expansion of its footprints in Southeast Asia.

Najib said: “We have been able to stay competitive because of the sheer volume of business in this region, coupled with our advantage of an early foray into the sector and an edge in quality human capital at far more competitive rates.

“Our superior cost position is powerfully attractive to airline customers.

“Malaysia has thus identified the MRO business as one of the sectors in the Business Services Entry National Key Economic Areas (NKEAs),” he said.

The Prime Minister said the NKEA represents an important catalyst for Malaysia’s development towards high-income nation status in 2020.

The MRO sector is projected to grow by 10 per cent annually and new projects are expected to create 20,000 jobs in the country, he said.

“This year our Entry Point Projects’ target is RM380 million in revenue from fleet technical management and RM2.4 billion from airframe MRO,” he said.

Najib said several initiatives were already underway to develop the MRO ecosystem.

He said there was greater development of Malaysia’s airport infrastructure, the availability of land and the creation of more conducive operating environment through improved tax and civil aviation regulations.

“These we are confident will continue to make Malaysia as a preferred MRO destination.

“The aspiration is to capture five per cent of the world market share in the MRO business.

“Thus, the government will be most supportive of any efforts to part take in this journey,” added Najib, who is also the Finance Minister. — Bernama"

The Secretary of State for Wales has been on a visit to Airbus’ final assembly line at Toulouse. Reporter SAM YARWOODwas there to join him and speak to some of the expats now working at the French plant

AIRBUS will continue to remain at the forefront of the world’s aeronautical industry, says the Secretary of State for Wales.

MP David Jones visited the company’s headquarters in Toulouse, France, last week to meet employees and take a tour of the Airbus A380 and A350 assembly lines.

The wings for the aircrafts are made in Broughton and Mr Jones highlighted the importance of Airbus to both the North Wales and UK economy.

He said: “There are over 6,000 people working in Broughton, and many more indirect jobs depending upon the Airbus factory and coming here to Toulouse actually makes you realise what the end of the process is.

“These enormous aircrafts – the A380s and A350s – each and every one of them is flying on wings that were made in Broughton so aeronautical excellence is very important to the North Wales economy just as much as it is the UK as a whole.

“The British aeronautical industry is the biggest in Europe, the second biggest in the world, and we are very anxious to ensure that we maintain our leadership.”

Mr Jones’ visit was timed to coincide with launch of the second round of bidding for the ï¿½40m industry and government-funded National Aerospace Technology Exploitation Programme (NATEP).

The scheme will allow more small and medium-sized companies to apply for a share of the multi-million pound funding pot to help innovate technologies for new products or manufacturing processes over the next four years.

Mr Jones added: “As you know we have recently made an announcement to enable more funding for smaller and medium-sized businesses to be brought up and to improve their excellence within the industry. We are very conscious of the fact that this is a very important part of both the local and national economy and we want to do everything we can to encourage it.”

The Secretary of State made the announcement at a special networking event hosted by aerospace trade organisation, ADS Group, in Toulouse.

The programme, which will be open to aerospace suppliers in January next year, is designed to create or retain 1,200 jobs within the supply chain, supporting the aims of the Aerospace Growth Partnership to maintain the UK’s global position in the aerospace market.

Mr Jones added: “The global aerospace market is one that is constantly evolving, and is one that this Government is fully behind.

“I would encourage businesses to take advantage of this new opportunity to get the additional support they need to help the UK to maintain its world leading position in this very important sector.”"

Alex and Daniel both became apprentices with the company after leaving school."
"Airport company mum on aircraft accident - Truth, for its own sake. - New Era","Tue, 15 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3ZXJhbGl2ZS5uYS9wb3N0cy9haXJwb3J0LWNvbXBhbnktbXVtLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWFjY2lkZW500gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WINDHOEK – The Namibia Airports Company (NAC) is tight-lipped on details of what led to an incident in which one aircraft rammed into another at Hosea Kutako International Airport on Friday afternoon. The incident, deemed serious by industry experts, involved a South African Airways aircraft that was being guided to its parking apron by a NAC marshal and a parked brand new Airbus A330-200 of Air Namibia Yesterday the Deputy Director of Aircraft Accident Investigations at the Directorate of Civil Aviation, Erickson Nengola, said the incident was the first of its kind involving big aircraft at Hosea Kutako International Airport since his tenure at the aviation department in the Ministry of Works and Transport. Nengola could however not divulge more information saying that the matter is still under investigation. He said that a preliminary report has been done but would first be forwarded to the Minister of Works and Transport, Erkki Nghimtina. Nengola added that NAC is responsible for defined markings or lines at the international airports to where aircraft are directed once they land. However, an airport marshal should still be able to coordinate parking for pilots in the absence of clear markings. Meanwhile the Airbus spokesperson for Southern Africa Linden Birns toldthat the accident was not that big, describing what happened as a mere incident in which one aircraft “grazed” the other. Birns, who is based in Cape Town, said the abrasion caused by the SAA plane damaged the winglet of the Air Namibia Airbus A330-200 but not the wing itself. He explained that a winglet is an attachment to the wing, which reduces resistance or drag, resulting in less fuel consumption. But when the winglet is damaged, it causes error dynamic attachment to the wing, which increases fuel consumption. “It [the winglet] is not a safety feature. It means that the aeroplane can fly without the winglet,” Birns said. He could not divulge the cost of the damage but disclosed that a new winglet has already been delivered to Lufthansa Technik in Germany to replace the damaged winglet. The accident happened between 15h00 and 16h00 on Friday. However the plane still managed to depart to Frankfurt after repairs were done to the winglet. Birns said installing the replacement part only takes a couple of hours and the aeroplane should be fine. “It is operating quite safely,” he said, adding that he could not tell who was to blame for the incident and could not speculate either.
