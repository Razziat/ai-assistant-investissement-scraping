"Direct air carbon capture and storage for aviation, explained - Airbus","Mon, 18 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTA3LWRpcmVjdC1haXItY2FyYm9uLWNhcHR1cmUtYW5kLXN0b3JhZ2UtZm9yLWF2aWF0aW9uLWV4cGxhaW5lZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What may sound like science fiction to many is now fast becoming reality. Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS) – which removes human-induced CO 2 directly from the air – could help multiple industries meet their net-zero carbon emissions targets. For hard-to-abate industries like aviation, it is emerging as a promising complementary solution to sustainable aviation fuel and hydrogen.

show more show less Direct Air Carbon Capture & Storage (DACCS) involves removing carbon emissions directly from the ambient air and safely storing them underground. Airbus is partnering with 1PointFive to bring this innovative technology to aviation. Discover how it works.

The sunrises in the Permian Basin, located in southwestern USA, are spectacular. Hundreds of kilometres of pancake-flat, arid scrubland stretch almost endlessly, until they meet the enormous Texan skies on the horizon.

There isn’t much to catch the eye around these parts. But as the road continues and the sun climbs higher into the deep blue sky, the view suddenly changes. Seemingly out of nowhere, a grey and black metal structure – hundreds of metres long and several storeys high – appears shimmering in the distance.

Move closer, it soon becomes clear: this massive structure is unlike anything else around. Embedded within each hangar-like block, a multitude of enormous fans spin like giant air conditioning units. And beyond these fans lies what looks like a manufacturing plant – a maze of metal pipes and storage tanks amid the rugged, dusty landscape.

This is a direct air capture facility through which hundreds of tonnes of carbon are being drawn in from the air. Here, in the year 2030 and in the heart of the Lone Star state, this spectacular creation is now a key bastion in the fight against climate change and the world’s transition to a net-zero energy system.

DACCS: how it works

A direct air capture – or DAC, for short – facility acts like a large-scale, highly efficient tree: it sucks air out of the atmosphere and extracts the CO 2 present there. In 2030, there will likely be dozens of them around the world. Back to the present day, however, and this technology is still in its infancy.

Carbon Engineering is looking to change that. The Canadian company has pioneered a direct air capture technology at its pilot plant in Squamish, Canada and has now set its sights on large-scale deployment. 1PointFive – Carbon Engineering’s licensed US partner – is developing these facilities at a megaton scale in the United States and elsewhere. The DAC facility, targeted to become operational in 2024 in the Permian Basin, is expected to capture up to one million tonnes of CO 2 from the air per year once fully operational. This is roughly equivalent to the work – or absorption capacity – of approximately 40 million trees.

The technology is simple: a large fan draws air into an air contactor, which is modelled on industrial cooling towers. The air passes over thin plastic surfaces with a non-toxic potassium hydroxide solution flowing over them to trap the CO 2 molecules as a carbonate salt.

The carbonate salt is separated from the solution using a pellet reactor. The carbon pellets are then heated in a calciner to release the CO 2 as pure gas. Lastly, the processed pellets are hydrated in a device called a “slaker” and recycled for use in the original capture solution.

The captured pure CO 2 can then either be stored underground or reused for the production of, for example, Power-to-Liquid fuel through a complementary process called AIR TO FUELSTM. The former, known as carbon storage or sequestration, involves injecting the CO 2 into saline formations more than a kilometre below the earth’s surface. As a result, CO 2 is permanently and safely stored underground.



Direct Air Carbon Capture & Storage (DACCS) involves removing carbon emissions directly from the ambient air. Discover how the technology works.

Bringing affordable and scalable carbon removals to aviation

In October 2021, the aviation industry adopted the long-term climate goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Multiple decarbonisation solutions – technology innovation in aircraft design, new fuels like hydrogen and SAF, efficiency improvements in airport operations and air traffic management, and market-based measures – have all been earmarked to help achieve this goal. But these alone will not suffice to reduce aviation’s CO 2 emissions to the required levels.

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), simply eliminating emissions will not be enough for the world to reach net zero by 2050 – removing CO 2 from the atmosphere will also be necessary. And because hard-to-abate industries like aviation cannot capture their emissions at the source, direct air capture is considered a more suitable negative emissions solution.

This is why Airbus has partnered with 1PointFive to bring carbon removals from direct air capture technology to the aviation industry. In fact, Airbus has pre-purchased 100,000 tonnes of carbon removals per year over four years – or 400,000 tonnes in total – from 1PointFive as part of an initial offtake.

Several airlines have shown interest to collaborate with Airbus in this area with the objective to promote direct air capture as an essential pathway, among others, to achieve the industry’s net-zero target. As the aviation industry further refines its course towards net zero, it is partnerships like these – which bring together key stakeholders from both inside and outside the industry – that will be essential to bringing climate-neutral air travel ever closer to reality."

Could an open fan engine cut carbon emissions for more sustainable aviation? - Airbus,"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTA3LWNvdWxkLWFuLW9wZW4tZmFuLWVuZ2luZS1jdXQtY2FyYm9uLWVtaXNzaW9ucy1mb3ItbW9yZS1zdXN0YWluYWJsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The technologies being developed for the next-generation fuel-efficient propulsion systems – and whose progress Airbus follows closely – are taking shape at all the big aero-engine makers, here we focus on one of these: CFM International’s “open fan” technology.

The open fan architecture is a key component of the engine maker’s “Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines” (RISE) technology development programme – which aims to demonstrate and mature a range of new technologies for future engines that could enter service by the mid-2030s.

Going forward, open fan technology will also be the focus of a major Airbus flight demonstration campaign to be performed in collaboration with CFM in the second half of this decade.

show more show less A new Airbus A380 demonstrator to accelerate advanced propulsion technologies through ground and flight testing.

Joint flight-testing ambitions

The joint demonstration programme will use shared flight test assets. Provisionally the plan is for CFM to perform engine ground tests, along with flight test validation at GE Aviation’s Flight Test Operations centre in Victorville, California, USA.

A second phase of flight tests will be performed from the Airbus flight test facility in Toulouse, France, in the second half of the decade. For these tests, the open fan engine will be mounted under the wing of a specially configured and instrumented A380 testbed aircraft.

The joint Airbus and CFM objectives for the open fan joint demonstration on the A380 are extensive. The high-level goals include: evaluation of open fan propulsive efficiency and performance on an aircraft; acceleration and maturity of technologies through ground testing; assessment of aircraft/engine integration and aerodynamics (thrust, drag, loads); and evaluation of internal and external noise levels.

Prediction capabilities are key to find the right design that meets both the fuel efficiency and the acoustic targets (for the communities around airports and also for passengers inside the cabin). And because CFM’s engine and the wing will be very close-coupled, these capabilities have to be developed in close collaboration.

In addition, Airbus and CFM will collaborate on understanding the use of hybrid-electric capabilities and ensuring compatibility with 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Preparing the hardware for flight tests on an A380 testbed…

However, before any of the above objectives can be investigated, between now and the first demonstration flight in the second half of the decade, an intensive phase of Engineering preparatory work is planned.

Pascal Arrouy, Airbus’ Open Fan Architect in the “Propulsion of Tomorrow” R&T programme explains: “We will first need to determine the flight physics constraints, design and assessments for the flight-test demonstration (FTD) engine installation. These will include: definition of the pylon ‘aero-lines’ (ie. the aerodynamics and physical geometries), assessment of loads, handling qualities and performance and preparation of modeling to support flight-test analysis.”

In addition, the pylon with the engine mounts and attachment will be jointly designed for minimising weight and vibration transmission to the cabin, as well as engine system integration. The fuselage structure affected by the propulsion system impact will also be studied.

Various aircraft systems will also need to be modified and preparatory tests performed to ensure that the behaviour of the A380 flight test aircraft with an open fan engine installed can be well understood for flight clearance and data validity. Specific areas of focus will include: power management (including open fan compatibility with hybrid-electric aircraft architectures); integration of the engine control systems; flight controls optimisation; fuel distribution; vibration analysis, and instrumentation installation.

“Once all these activities are complete, we will be able to move to the next phase which is the physical manufacture and assembly of the modifications to the aircraft including the new customised pylon,” explains Pascal. “This will be followed by specific tests on engine components to support the dossier needed for ultimate flight clearance of the complete package.”

Meanwhile inside the aircraft, workstations will also be installed to accommodate dedicated flight test engineers and technicians, who will monitor and measure the in-flight performance of the various mission system sensors installed. To this end the aircraft will be heavily instrumented with hundreds of sensors, including microphones, accelerometers, static pressure sensors and cameras.

The big picture ahead

For preparing the future, Airbus is committed to meeting the Paris Agreement targets and leading the decarbonisation of the aviation sector in full collaboration with all stakeholders – including engine manufacturers. Between now and 2035, Airbus’ R&T is focused on testing various technologies to reduce aircraft emissions. These include: alternative fuels with 100% SAF compatibility before 2030; hydrogen technologies; hybridization; wide scope of inter-dependent solutions which will collectively contribute to Airbus’ decarbonisation ambitions. With these planned collaborative tests and demonstration of open fan technology with CFM we will hopefully be a signification set closer to achieving this.

From two counter-rotating fans to a single rotating fan + one fixed…

In the mid-1980s GE developed and flight-tested the GE36 “Unducted Fan” (UDF) engine demonstrator. The GE36 UDF relied on a forward fan that was driven by a dedicated turbine, while the rear fan was driven by another turbine which rotated in the opposite direction.

Fast-forward to 2017, when as part of a European Clean Sky initiative, Safran had developed a revitalised “Contra-Rotating-Open-Rotor” (CROR) concept and subsequently ground-tested it. CROR and the GE36 were both pusher configurations (blades at the rear) featuring two sets of fan blades which rotated in opposing directions.

Building on the CROR research, CFM’s open fan demonstrator includes many improvements and simplifications. This is a puller configuration (blades at the front) where the rear set of blades does not rotate. These rear blades are effectively a set of variable-pitch ‘stators’ which can efficiently manipulate the thrust airflow generated by the rotating front set, while further reducing mechanical complexity, weight and noise. With this change, the engine can direct air flow to fly at speeds consistent with conventional turbo fan engine architectures and deliver an improved cabin experience for passengers."

Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS) is a high-potential technology that involves filtering and removing CO 2 emissions directly from the air using high powered fans. Once removed from the air, the CO 2 is safely and permanently stored in geologic reservoirs. As the aviation industry cannot capture CO 2 emissions released into the atmosphere at source, a direct air carbon capture and storage solution would allow the sector to extract the equivalent amount of emissions from its operations directly from atmospheric air.

Carbon removals via direct air capture technology complement other solutions that deliver CO 2 reductions, such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), by addressing remaining emissions that cannot be directly eliminated.

As part of the agreements, the airlines have committed to engage in negotiations on the possible pre-purchase of verified and durable carbon removal credits starting in 2025 through to 2028. The carbon removal credits will be issued by Airbus’ partner 1PointFive – a subsidiary of Occidental’s Low Carbon Ventures business and the global deployment partner of direct air capture company Carbon Engineering. Airbus’ partnership with 1PointFive includes the pre-purchase of 400,000 tonnes of carbon removal credits to be delivered over four years.

“We are already seeing strong interest from airlines to explore affordable and scalable carbon removals,” said Julie Kitcher, Executive Vice President Communications and Corporate Affairs, Airbus. “These first letters of intent mark a concrete step towards the use of this promising technology for both Airbus’ own decarbonisation plan and the aviation sector’s ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.”

“We’re excited to partner with Airbus. Carbon removal credits from direct air capture offer a practical, near-term and lower cost pathway that enables the aviation industry to advance its decarbonisation goals,” said Michael Avery, 1PointFive’s President.

“Air Canada is proud to support the early adoption of direct air capture and storage as we and the aviation industry move forward on the path to decarbonisation,” said Teresa Ehman, Senior Director, Environmental Affairs at Air Canada. “While we are in the early days of a long journey and much remains to be done, this technology is one of the many important levers that will be needed, along with many others, including sustainable aviation fuel and increasingly efficient and new technology aircraft, to decarbonise the aviation industry.”

“Sustainability is an integral part of the Air France-KLM Group’s strategy. While we activate all levers already at our disposal to reduce our carbon footprint – including fleet renewal, SAF incorporation and eco-piloting, we are also active partners in research and innovation, advancing knowledge on emerging technology in order to improve its price and efficiency. In addition to CO2 capture and storage, the technology opens up very interesting perspectives for the production of synthetic sustainable aviation fuel. The letter of intent we are signing with Airbus today embodies the collaborative approach the aviation industry has initiated to find effective solutions that meet the challenge of our environmental transition. Only together can we address the climate emergency,” said Fatima da Gloria de Sousa, VP Sustainability Air France-KLM.

Jane Ashton, easyJet’s Director of Sustainability, said: “Direct air capture is a nascent technology with a huge potential, so we are very pleased to be part of this important initiative. We believe that carbon removal solutions will be an essential element of our pathway to net zero, complementing other components and helping us to neutralise any residual emissions in the future. Ultimately, our ambition is to achieve zero carbon emission flying, and we are working with partners across the industry, including Airbus, on several dedicated projects to accelerate the development of future zero carbon emission aircraft technology.”

Jonathon Counsell, IAG´s Head of Sustainability, said: “Our industry’s transition will require a

variety of solutions, including new aircraft, sustainable aviation fuels and emerging technologies. Carbon removal will play an important role in enabling our sector to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.”

“DACCS represents an innovative way not only to remove net carbon from the atmosphere, but it also has the potential to play a part in the development of synthetic sustainable aviation fuels,” said Juan José Tohá, Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Director, LATAM Airlines Group. “There is no silver bullet for decarbonising the industry and we will rely on a combination of measures to reach our net-zero ambitions, including greater efficiencies, sustainable aviation fuels and new technologies, supported by the conservation of strategic ecosystems and quality offsets.”

Caroline Drischel, Head of Corporate Responsibility of Lufthansa Group said: “Achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 is key for the Lufthansa Group. This involves billion euro investments in continuous fleet modernisation and our strong commitment to Sustainable Aviation Fuels. In addition we are exploring new technologies, like advanced and safe carbon capture and storage processes.”

Holly Boyd-Boland, Virgin Atlantic’s VP Corporate Development, said: “Reducing Virgin Atlantic’s carbon footprint is our number one climate action priority. Alongside our fleet transformation programme, fuel-efficient operations and supporting the commercial scalability of sustainable aviation fuels, the removal of CO 2 directly from the atmosphere through innovative carbon capture and storage technologies becomes a powerful tool in reaching our target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. We look forward to partnering with Airbus and 1PointFive to accelerate the development of Direct Air Carbon Capture and Permanent Storage solutions alongside our industry peers.”

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), carbon removal is required to help the world go beyond climate mitigation and to support the achievement of net-zero targets. In addition, according to the Air Transport Action Group’s (ATAG) Waypoint 2050 report, offsets (mainly in the form of carbon removals) will be needed – between 6% and 8% – to make up any remaining shortfalls in emissions above the goal.

How Blue Condor will accelerate Airbus' first hydrogen-powered test flights - Airbus,"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTA3LWhvdy1ibHVlLWNvbmRvci13aWxsLWFjY2VsZXJhdGUtYWlyYnVzLWZpcnN0LWh5ZHJvZ2VuLXBvd2VyZWQtdGVzdC1mbGlnaHRz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Blue Condor, launched by Airbus UpNext, is taking a modified glider up to 33,000 feet – an extreme altitude for an aircraft that normally cruises below 10,000 feet – to analyse hydrogen combustion’s impact on contrail properties. The result of this analysis will provide critical information on aviation’s non-CO 2 emissions, including contrails and NOx, in advance of the ZEROe demonstrator flight testing.

show more show less This demonstrator is taking a modified glider up to 33,000 feet – an extreme altitude for an aircraft that normally cruises below 10,000 feet – to analyse hydrogen combustion’s impact on contrail properties. The result of this analysis will provide critical information on aviation’s non-CO2 emissions, including contrails and NOx, in advance of the ZEROe demonstrator flight testing.

The Arcus-J glider is somewhat of an outlier in the world of aviation. It is configured like any sailplane capable of free flight thanks to its 20-metre wingspan, but with the added advantage of a retractable PBS TJ-100 jet engine to optimise the glider’s self-launching and long cross-country capabilities.

It all started in 2016. Bob Carlton of US company Desert Aerospace converted the Arcus-M, a motorised sailplane, into what is now known as an “Arcus-J jet sailplane.” After retrofitting the glider, Bob and the Arcus-J’s owner Dennis Tito powered up and embarked on the world’s first significant long-soaring flight in a jet-powered sailplane.

Today, there are only a few Arcus-J gliders in the world. Now, two of these gliders have been called upon to undertake the Blue Condor mission – an Airbus UpNext project that focuses on analysing contrails and other emissions from a hydrogen combustion engine by comparing them to those produced by a conventional kerosene engine in the same power class. The Perlan Project, alongside Airbus and its technical partners, will modify one glider and, thanks to Perlan’s world-renowned, high-altitude piloting expertise, will operate the gliders at their limit during each phase of the mission.

A flight test campaign in three phases

The first phase of the Blue Condor project involves modifying one Arcus-J glider. Airbus engineers are replacing the rear pilot seating with a hydrogen-propulsion system. Two 700-bar gaseous hydrogen tanks will provide fuel to the turbojet hydrogen combustion engine. The second Arcus-J glider will remain unmodified, operating on its existing turbojet engine.

Once fully modified, the glider is expected to take its first flight in July 2022. The aim of this first flight test campaign is to validate the overall platform configuration, as well as flight handling in real conditions. A second flight test campaign is planned for November 2022 during which the modified glider will operate exclusively on hydrogen.

The third flight test campaign, scheduled for early 2023, will see a Grob Egrett – another aircraft reputed for its long-endurance and high-altitude test capabilities – steer the two gliders to the test altitude, release them, and then mirror their every movement at speeds of 80-85kts during back-to-back tests. In doing so, the Grob Egrett will act as a “chase” aircraft, capturing critical data thanks to the emissions sensors and associated instrumentation provided by key partner DLR – the German aerospace centre.

“The Blue Condor project is a major milestone on our ZEROe journey as it will launch the first series of in-flight tests using a hydrogen combustion engine at Airbus,” explains Mathias Andriamisaina, Airbus Head of Zero-Emission Demonstrators. “These flight test campaigns will provide an excellent knowledge base on hydrogen’s impact on engine behaviour, contrails and other non-CO 2 emissions. This will undoubtedly inform the direction of future flight testing using the upcoming ZEROe A380 test platform.”

This demonstrator is taking a modified glider up to 33,000 feet – an extreme altitude for an aircraft that normally cruises below 10,000 feet – to analyse hydrogen combustion’s impact on contrail properties. The result of this analysis will provide critical information on aviation’s non-CO2 emissions, including contrails and NOx, in advance of the ZEROe demonstrator flight testing.

An in-depth look at contrails from hydrogen combustion

Analysing contrail properties at near and far fields is a core objective of the Blue Condor project. Indeed, very little research currently exists on contrails produced by hydrogen combustion.

Contrails, or ""condensation trails,"" are clouds of ice crystals that can form behind an aircraft at high altitude. Although hydrogen combustion can produce contrails depending on the ambient atmospheric conditions, they differ significantly to those produced by conventional combustion engines. And because hydrogen combustion emits about 2.6 times more water compared to standard JetA/A1, in-depth analysis is required to understand its full impact on contrails.

Contrail formation and measurement is highly complex. High altitudes and cold environments offer ideal meteorological conditions for contrails to form naturally due to the static temperatures and relative humidity at altitude. A variety of elements is of interest when analysing contrail properties, including the following:

Ice crystal size, distribution, density and number

Water vapour in the atmosphere

Blue Condor’s first two flight test campaigns will be carried out in Nevada, USA. The third will be conducted in North Dakota, USA, in partnership with the University of North Dakota, to take advantage of the ideal meteorological conditions.

Contrail characterisation: a key Airbus research area

Contrail characterisation is of significant interest to any future hydrogen combustion aircraft programme. The Blue Condor project is thus a cornerstone of the ZEROe initiative, shedding light on one key aspect of hydrogen-powered flight. In fact, the results of Blue Condor’s three flight test campaigns will play an essential role in preparing the groundwork for the flight-testing phases of the ZEROe demonstrator using the A380 platform.

In addition, the objectives of the Blue Condor project perfectly complement Airbus’ overall climate strategy, which aims to better understand contrails produced by alternative fuel sources. Several Airbus initiatives are currently underway in this respect, including the ECLIF3 and VOLAN flight demonstration projects involving the A350 and A319neo respectively. Both initiatives focus on emissions characterisation, including contrails, related to the use of 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“In partnership with the Perlan Project and the DLR, we’re really taking a scholarly and science-based approach to contrail characterisation,” Mathias says. “The use of innovative methods – like a modified glider to reach higher altitudes and a chaser aircraft to capture emissions – also proves that we’re willing to try new things to obtain the data needed to give us a complete picture of aviation’s climate impact.”

The Blue Condor project is a major milestone on our ZEROe journey as it will launch the first series of in-flight tests using a hydrogen combustion engine at Airbus.

The building is scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of 2023. Occupying a surface area of 1,000 m2, the new structure will be used for testing systems for electric takeoff and landing vehicles (eVTOLs). The ceremony was attended by Anna Christmann, the Federal Government Coordinator of German Aerospace Policy.



“We are investing in the future of electric flight because we believe this technology holds key potential for zero-emission flights,” said Wolfgang Schoder, Managing Director of Airbus Helicopters in Germany. “Urban Air Mobility will change the way we travel in cities and beyond and it will be a new pillar of business for Airbus. Donauwörth plays an important role in the development and construction of CityAirbus NextGen.”



""With the ground-breaking ceremony for the Urban Air Mobility Test Centre at the Donauwörth site, Airbus Helicopters is laying an important foundation for the further progress of electrically powered aircraft,"" said Aerospace Coordinator Anna Christmann. ""As the federal government, we welcome the efforts made by industry to develop new propulsion systems and aircraft that will enable climate-neutral aviation in the future.""



The hangar integrates high-voltage equipment and lithium batteries and is designed to undergo testing with the highest safety precautions. All tests needed before CityAirbus NextGen’s maiden flight can be carried out there. These tests cover the electric motors with their eight rotors as well as the aircraft’s other systems such as flight controls and avionics.



In September 2021, Airbus unveiled its eVTOL prototype CityAirbus NextGen, to explore advanced air mobility technologies and bring urban air mobility services to life. With a range of 80 km and cruise speed of 120 km/h, it has been developed to be suited for a range of deployments in urban areas. As well as carrying passengers, the aircraft could also be deployed on medical missions or used in an eco-tourism context. Over the past few months, the Company has selected partners for the main structural components of its prototype. Airbus is also working closely with industrial and institutional partners to lead the development of urban air mobility ecosystems, as recently announced with ITA Airways in Italy, or through the launch of the Air Mobility Initiative in Germany.

Airbus Helicopters and VRM Switzerland to develop the world's first H145 Virtual Reality simulator - Airbus,"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wNy1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtYW5kLXZybS1zd2l0emVybGFuZC10by1kZXZlbG9wLXRoZS13b3JsZHMtZmlyc3TSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Marignane, Airbus Helicopters and VRM Switzerland are co-developing a Virtual Reality (VR) training device for the twin-engine H145 helicopter. This innovative new training tool will offer H145 operators an affordable, compact training solution with realistic flight behaviour and full-body immersion, as well as the 3D vision and high resolution scenery of VR technology.



VRM Switzerland and Airbus Helicopters established their collaboration in 2021 to bring the EASA-qualified H125 VR training device to the market, enabling pilots to train realistically and execute complete proficiency checks on the simulator.



“As we did with the H125 VR simulator, our Airbus pilots and experts will work hand in hand with VRM’s team, bringing our OEM experience to this affordable, flexible training solution that will surely answer our customer’s requirements while also adhering to our high standards for operational safety. With this type of simulator, the pilot can enter operational

scenarios that would be very risky to attempt in actual flight but which bring significant added value to training,” says Christoph Zammert, Executive Vice President of Customer Support & Services at Airbus Helicopters.



“Having already successfully logged thousands of training hours with our simulators, we want to make this technology available to H145 operators by developing a VR flight training device for the five-bladed H145.This will allow H145 crews to prepare for their demanding missions with scenario-based training performed in a safe and realistic environment,” adds Fabi Riesen, CEO of VRM Switzerland.



Containing the OEM data package, the H145 VR simulator once qualified will allow pilots to perform proficiency checks and receive training credits. It will be used to perform type ratings including normal flight, emergency situations, hoist operations and flight with night vision goggles, as well as instrument ratings.

EBIT (reported) € 2.6 billion; EPS (reported) € 2.42

Free cash flow before M&A and customer financing € 2.0 billion

A320 Family monthly production rate target of 75 for 2025 unchanged; adjustment to 2022 and 2023 ramp-up trajectory

2022 guidance updated to around 700 commercial aircraft deliveries

2022 guidance maintained for EBIT Adjusted and FCF before M&A and customer financing



Amsterdam, 27 July 2022 – Airbus SE (stock exchange symbol: AIR) reported consolidated financial results for the Half-Year (H1) ended 30 June 2022.

“Airbus delivered a solid H1 2022 financial performance in a complex operating environment, with the geopolitical and economic situation creating further uncertainties for the industry. The supply chain challenges are leading us to adjust the A320 Family ramp-up steps in 2022 and 2023, and we now target a monthly rate of 65 in early 2024. Our aircraft delivery target for 2022 has been updated accordingly. The earnings and free cash flow guidance are maintained, underpinned by the H1 financials,” said Guillaume Faury, Airbus Chief Executive Officer. “The Airbus teams are engaged with suppliers and partners to ramp up towards an A320 Family monthly production rate of 75 in 2025, backed by strong customer demand.”

Gross commercial aircraft orders increased to 442 (H1 2021: 165 aircraft) with net orders of 259 aircraft after cancellations (H1 2021: 38 aircraft). The order backlog amounted to 7,046 commercial aircraft on 30 June 2022. Airbus Helicopters booked 163 net orders (H1 2021: 123 units), including 14 Super Puma Family and in Q1 it was awarded the contract for the Tiger MkIII attack helicopter upgrade programme. Airbus Defence and Space’s order intake by value increased to € 6.5 billion (H1 2021: € 3.5 billion), corresponding to a book-to-bill ratio of around 1.3. Second quarter orders included the contract to deliver 20 latest generation Eurofighter jets to the Spanish Air Force.

Consolidated revenues totalled € 24.8 billion (H1 2021: € 24.6 billion). A total of 297(1) commercial aircraft were delivered (H1 2021: 297 aircraft), comprising 25 A220s, 230 A320 Family, 13 A330sand 29 A350s(2). Revenues generated by Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities were broadly stable. Airbus Helicopters delivered 115 units (H1 2021: 115 units), with revenues rising by 6 percent mainly reflecting growth in services and a favourable mix in programmes. Revenues at Airbus Defence and Space increased 11 percent, mainly driven by the Military Aircraft business and following the Eurodrone contract signature in February. Four A400M airlifters were delivered in H1 2022.

Consolidated EBIT Adjusted – an alternativeperformance measure and key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses – was broadly stable at € 2,645 million (H1 2021: € 2,703 million).

EBIT Adjusted related to Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities was broadly stable at € 2,276 million (H1 2021: € 2,291 million). It included the non-recurring positive impact from retirement obligations recorded in Q1, partly offset by the impact from international sanctions against Russia which was reduced as compared to Q1 2022 following good progress on the remarketing of some aircraft. The net positive impact from these two non-recurring elements was largely offset by a less favourable currency hedging rate compared to H1 2021.

On the A320 programme, production is progressing towards a rate of 75 aircraft per month in 2025 as previously communicated. Given the current supply chain challenges, the Company is adapting the ramp-up trajectory and now targets a monthly rate of 65 in early 2024, around six months later than previously planned. The first flight of the A321XLR took place in June, representing an important milestone towards the aircraft’s entry-into-service that is expected to take place in early 2024. On widebody aircraft, the Company is exploring, together with its supply chain, the feasibility of further rate increases to meet growing market demand as international air travel recovers.

Airbus Helicopters’ EBIT Adjusted increased to € 215 million (H1 2021: € 183 million), partly driven by the growth in services and a favourable mix in programmes. It also reflects the non-recurring elements booked in Q1, including the positive impact related to retirement obligations.

EBIT Adjusted at Airbus Defence and Space decreased to € 155 million (H1 2021: € 229 million). This mainly reflects the impairment related to the Ariane 6 launcher delay, the impact of rising inflation in some long-term contracts across the Division’s portfolio and the consequences of international sanctions, partly offset by the positive impact related to retirement obligations booked in Q1.

On the A400M programme, development activities continue towards achieving the revised capability roadmap. Retrofit activities are progressing in close alignment with the customer. In Q2 2022, a charge of € 0.2 billion was recorded, mainly reflecting the updated assumptions of inflation on the launch contract. Risks remain on the qualification of technical capabilities and associated costs, on aircraft operational reliability, on cost reductions and on securing export orders in time as per the revised baseline.

Consolidated self-financed R&Dexpenses totalled € 1,256 million (H1 2021: € 1,262 million).

Consolidated EBIT(reported) amounted to € 2,579 million (H1 2021: € 2,727 million), including net Adjustments of € -66 million.

These Adjustments comprised:

€ +226 million related to the dollar pre-delivery payment mismatch and balance sheet revaluation, of which € +36 million were in Q2;

€ -218 million related to the A400M programme, of which € -217 million were in Q2;

€ -33 million related to the Aerostructures transformation in France and Germany, of which € -26 million were in Q2;

€ -7 million related to the A380 programme, of which € +4 million were in Q2;

€ -34 million of other costs including compliance, of which € -29 million were in Q2.

The financial result was € 107 million (H1 2021: € -30 million). It mainly reflects the positive net impact from the revaluation of certain equity investments, partially offset by the revaluation of financial instruments as well as the net interest result of € -136 million. Consolidated net income(3) was € 1,901 million (H1 2021: € 2,231 million) with consolidated reported earnings per share of € 2.42 (H1 2021: € 2.84).

Consolidated free cash flowbefore M&A and customer financing was€ 1,955 million (H1 2021: € 2,051 million), reflecting the profit translated into cash. It also included a favourable timing of cash receipts and payments partly offset by an increase in inventory. Consolidated free cash flow was € 1,646 million (H1 2021: € 2,012 million). The 2021 dividend of € 1.50 per share, or € 1.2 billion, was paid in Q2 2022 while pension contributions totalled € 0.4 billion in H1 2022. On 30 June 2022, the gross cash position stood at € 21.6 billion (year-end 2021: € 22.7 billion) with a consolidated net cash position(4) of € 7.2 billion (year-end 2021: € 7.7 billion).

The liquidity position remains strong, standing at € 27.6 billion at the end of June 2022. In June, the Company bought back a portion of its bonds maturing between 2024 and 2028 for a total amount of € 1 billion to reduce the gross debt position, optimise the balance sheet and regain financial flexibility. In July, liquidity was further improved through the upsizing of the undrawn Revolving Syndicated Credit Facility from € 6 billion to € 8 billion, while the tenor was increased to 5 years with 2 extension options of 1 year. The pricing of this facility benefitted from improved conditions in the loan market and continues to be linked to sustainability criteria.

Outlook

As the basis for its 2022 guidance, the Company assumes no further disruptions to the world economy, air traffic, the Company’s internal operations, and its ability to deliver products and services.

The Company’s 2022 guidance is before M&A.

On that basis,

The Company now targets to deliver around 700 commercial aircraft in 2022.

The Company maintains its target of around € 5.5 billion of EBIT Adjusted and around € 3.5 billion of Free Cash Flow before M&A and Customer Financing in 2022.

Glossary

KPI DEFINITION EBIT The Company continues to use the term EBIT (Earnings before interest and taxes). It is identical to Profit before finance cost and income taxes as defined by IFRS Rules. Adjustment Adjustment, an alternative performance measure, is a term used by the Company which includes material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses. EBIT Adjusted The Company uses an alternative performance measure, EBIT Adjusted, as a key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses. EPS Adjusted EPS Adjusted is an alternative performance measure of basic earnings per share as reported whereby the net income as the numerator does include Adjustments. For reconciliation, see the Analyst presentation. Gross cash position The Company defines its consolidated gross cash position as the sum of (i) cash and cash equivalents and (ii) securities (all as recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position). Net cash position The Company defines its consolidated net cash position as the sum of (i) cash and cash equivalents and (ii) securities, minus (iii) financing liabilities, plus or minus (iiii) interest rate contracts related to fair value hedges (all as recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position).

The completion of the first of three fully composite wing demonstrators marks the integration of more than 100 different component and manufacturing technologies that include an all-new industrial assembly system, and which have helped validate key automation targets.

Sabine Klauke, Airbus Chief Technical Officer, said: “Wing of Tomorrow brings a completely different build philosophy to the way we currently assemble wings and is a crucial part of our R&T portfolio that will help us assess the industrial feasibility of wing production in the future.”

The international team behind this UK-led programme is developing high-performing wing technologies, including the incorporation of a folding wing tip. Alongside research into sustainable aviation fuels and hydrogen propulsion, Wing of Tomorrow shows how Airbus is contributing to aviation’s decarbonisation ambitions and demonstrates the importance of large-scale industry collaboration in achieving our sector’s agenda for a more sustainable future.

The new build philosophy on Wing of Tomorrow eradicates in-tank working and enables manual and automated assembly to be smoothly integrated into an optimised industrial system. Through capturing the learning from building this first, and subsequent, wing demonstrators, Airbus will explore different scenarios to be able to make the right industrial choices to build our wings of the future.

Wing of Tomorrow composite components are designed to make the best use of technologies and reduce the amount of work during the assembly phase by more than 50%. Automation of the remaining drilling, achieving good tolerance control and wing shape, as well as the introduction of new approaches to inspection and validation will support Airbus’ ambition to create the most highly efficient wings of the future."

Meeting the growing demand

With an A220 order book that has more than doubled since 2018, Airbus is expanding its industrial footprint to support the increasing demand for the A220. In addition to the headquartered final assembly line (FAL) in Mirabel, Canada, Airbus extended its A220 assembly capacity to the U.S.-based A320 FAL located in Mobile, Alabama in January 2019. More recently, Mirabel welcomed an additional pre-assembly line, becoming the first Airbus pre-FAL located outside of Europe. This expansion will allow Airbus to more than double the current A220 production rates to 14 aircraft per month by the middle of this decade and meet a market need estimated to represent at least 7,000 aircraft over the next 20 years, namely due to the current acceleration in aging aircraft fleet replacement needs. The A220 has taken off and is on a path to great success, flying towards an exciting future, one that Airbus Teams around the world are committed to!"
Airbus successfully tests firefighting kit on A400M - Airbus,"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wNy1haXJidXMtc3VjY2Vzc2Z1bGx5LXRlc3RzLWZpcmVmaWdodGluZy1raXQtb24tYTQwMG3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Getafe, 26 July 2022 –Airbus has successfully tested a removable firefighting demonstrator kit on the A400M new generation airlifter during a flight test campaign in Spain.

The test campaign took place in daylight conditions with a minimum operating height of 150ft, flight speeds as low as 125 knots and drops involving up to 20 tonnes of water from the current tank in less than 10 seconds. The main objective of the campaign is to validate the drop water quantity and time as well as the ability of the A400M to carry out this new role with the kit.

The development of this prototype and the tests have been carried out in close collaboration with the 43rd Group of the Spanish Air Force, as well as European authorities in Firefighting operations and the Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge (MITECO).

“The development of this firefighting kit is an intrinsic part of our journey towards helping to create a more sustainable and safer world, not only by our actions but also through our products. We strongly believe the A400M can play a vital role in the fight against the ever increasing threat posed by wildfires and support the restoration of social and environmental systems,” said Mike Schoellhorn, CEO of Airbus Defence and Space.

The Airbus firefighting solution created for the A400M is a roll-on/roll-off (RORO) kit that requires no modification to the aircraft and therefore is interchangeable to any aircraft in the A400M fleet. The water is stored in a fixed tank in the cargo hold, and retained by two independent doors. These doors are connected to two flood pipes, so when the discharge is triggered, the water is expelled through two sections at the end of the ramp. The introduction of this RORO solution allows a rapid reaction to unforeseen fires and reconfiguration of the aircraft to any of its other roles.

Due to its low level flight capability and maneuverability at low speeds, the A400M can accurately drop payloads of water at very low heights, down to 150ft. In the future, in addition to the development of the production version of this kit, Airbus will analyze this operation also in night time conditions, reinforcing the efficiency and effectiveness of the mission.

Record-holding Perlan 2 pilots to fly glider with hydrogen combustion engine

Test campaign will study composition of hydrogen engine contrails

Farnborough, 20 July 2022 – Airbus UpNext, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Airbus, has revealed a flight test programme to study the contrails produced by a hydrogen combustion engine as part the Company’s ZEROe roadmap. The project, named “Blue Condor”, will launch two modified Arcus gliders, one equipped with a hydrogen combustion engine and one equipped with a conventional kerosene-powered combustion engine, in order to compare contrails emitted at high altitudes.

""Contrail characterisation is of significant interest to Airbus. We know that hydrogen emits no carbon dioxide when burned, but we also know that with water vapour and heat being the most significant by-products, hydrogen combustion does produce contrails. Although these contrails differ significantly to those produced by conventional JetA/A1 combustion engines, understanding their composition will be key to support our decarbonisation journey,” said Sandra Bour Schaeffer, CEO of Airbus UpNext. “In taking up this challenge we are making significant headway in our decarbonisation strategy and our ambition to bring the world’s first zero-emission commercial aircraft into service by 2035.”

The Blue Condor demonstrator will be supported by the Perlan Project team, which will be responsible for the modification of the Arcus gliders. They will also provide the high-altitude glider pilots, the same pilots who in 2018 set the world subsonic altitude record – 76,124 feet – in a pressurised glider for Airbus Perlan Mission II.

The German Research Centre DLR will collect and analyse data captured using their measurement instrumentation sensors on a chase aircraft, while Airbus will ensure the provision of the hydrogen system and equipment, including the combustion engine as well as the details of the flight test mission.

To ensure 100% comparable data between the hydrogen and conventional engine, the test flights will be carried out back-to-back under the same meteorological conditions. Test flights are scheduled for late 2022 in North Dakota, USA, in collaboration with the University of North Dakota.

Airbus is also conducting various demonstration programmes – including ECLIF3 (Emission and Climate Impact of Alternative Fuels) and VOLCAN (“VOL avec Carburants Alternatifs Nouveaux”) – to better understand contrails produced by sustainable aviation fuels.

Airbus Perlan Mission II is also continuing, with plans in 2023 to soar to altitudes approaching the Perlan 2 glider’s 90,000-feet service ceiling, in order to conduct research of upper atmospheric weather. If successful, Airbus Perlan Mission II would set the all-time world altitude record for wingborne flight, and would do so in a zero-emission aircraft.

Certified by the Spanish National Institute for Aerospace Technology (INTA), this capability is part of the new SMART MRTT developed by Airbus. The A3R system requires no additional equipment on the receiver aircraft and is intended to reduce air refuelling operator (ARO) workload, improve safety and optimise the rate of air-to-air refuelling (AAR) transfer in operational conditions to enable air superiority.

“The certification of the A3R capability is the result of a successful journey that started in 2018 with the world’s first automated contact with a boom system in a joint operation with the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Since then, we’ve achieved more aeronautical “world firsts” thanks to the support of our customers, especially with the key participation of our partner the RSAF, a launch customer and the first operator to benefit from this game-changing capability. The A330 MRTT continues to increase its technological advantage with superior air refuelling capabilities,” said Jean-Brice Dumont, Head of Military Air Systems at Airbus Defence and Space.

Through the collaboration between Airbus and the RSAF for the development of the SMART MRTT, an RSAF A330 MRTT took part in the development, flight test campaign and certification of the A3R. In addition, enhanced maintenance capabilities have been developed, allowing faster resolution of ground tasks, while providing the means for maximising the efficient use of spare parts.

The road for the evolution of the A330 MRTT does not stop here. Airbus, through its subsidiary Airbus UpNext, has launched Auto’Mate, a demonstrator that will develop, adapt, mature, integrate and evaluate technologies enabling Autonomous Assets Air-to-Air Refuelling (A4R) and Autonomous Formation Flight (AF2) operations. Auto’Mate will focus on automating the receiver aircraft’s tasks, which requires a set of new technologies that are the pillars of the UpNext Auto’Mate demonstrator.

These technological bricks will be tested in flight during 2023 with a final end-to-end demonstration mid-2024, using in both cases an A310 as the Tanker Refuelling Flight Test Bed and DT-25 Target Drones as receiver aircraft. The set of technologies developed in the Airbus Auto’Mate demonstrator will enable a disruptive step forward in the autonomy level of current Air-to-Air Refuelling (AAR) operations, to reduce crew fatigue and training costs, improve safety and efficiency, and pioneer Unmanned Air-to-Air Refuelling operations (including Unmanned-to-Unmanned AAR operations), a highly demanded capability for future defence scenarios. Auto´Mate is the first UpNext demonstrator to be launched, developed and concluded in Spain.

Airbus’s Chief Commercial Officer, Christian Scherer in an interview with The Air Current detailed the company’s maturing thinking around the A220-500. His comments are the first public discussion around adding a second engine supplier for not just a newly stretched model, but for the existing A220-100 and A220-300 originally spawned by Bombardier before the program was acquired by Airbus in 2018.

Scherer called the A220-300’s 3,550nm range “the sweetspot” while pondering the performance of the stretched A220. “I’m happy to see that both engine manufacturers — Pratt and CFM — have acknowledged that requirement,” said Scherer."
Airbus reshapes A350 cabin to accommodate up to 30 more seats - Flightglobal,"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vZmFybmJvcm91Z2gtMjAyMi9haXJidXMtcmVzaGFwZXMtYTM1MC1jYWJpbi10by1hY2NvbW1vZGF0ZS11cC10by0zMC1tb3JlLXNlYXRzLzE0OTU0Mi5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is nearing introduction of a new interior configuration standard for the A350 which will permit 10-abreast economy seating and potentially add 30 seats to the aircraft’s accommodation.

The densification change will allow the A350-1000 to carry “well over” 400 passengers in certain configurations, chief commercial officer Christian Scherer told FlightGlobal at the Farnborough air show.

He says the new standard provides “increased volume” inside the cabin which allows the airframer to “very comfortably” put a 10-abreast layout in economy, and provide 20-30 more seats depending on the pitch.

Scherer stresses that this is achieved “without compromising seat width”, and involves fitting such features as a slightly-reshaped cabin wall lining, so the walls are “pushed out a little bit”, providing additional interior width.

“That’s something that’s beginning to get good resonance in the market, because the comfort standards of the A350 have proven to be unparalleled,” he says.

“The cabin altitude on the airplane, the air quality, the sound levels of the A350 provide passengers with a very unique comfort environment.”

Initial aircraft featuring the new standard will be entering service shortly.

Airbus previously put the typical accommodation of the A350-1000 at 369 seats in a two-class layout, including 54 business seats and 315 nine-abreast economy seats.

The denser cabin option would bring the aircraft closer to the Boeing 777-9 which has a basic two-class layout of 414 seats – comprising 42 in business and 372 in 10-abreast economy.

While the update will raise the seating capacity of the A350-1000, Airbus is not immediately entertaining thoughts of designing a physically larger variant of the twinjet type – despite recent remarks from Emirates Airline president Tim Clark and IATA head Willie Walsh that the -1000 is too small and Airbus should consider an aircraft capable of seating at least 350 passengers in four classes.

Scherer says that Airbus takes “good note” of Clark’s comments, particularly as he remains a “champion” of the A380 – the discontinuation of which left the A350-1000 as Airbus highest-capacity offering.

“His arguments are well taken,” says Scherer. “Do we look at solutions, possible developments on A350s for additional seats? Of course we do. We constantly do, because of the [reduced] unit cost and to improve productivity of the programme.

“Is there anything on the drawing board to stretch the airplane, make it bigger? No there isn’t – but are we looking at it? For sure we are.

“We’re just out of the worst downturn we’ve ever seen in this industry. And we’re at an air show, so people saying ‘I need bigger airplanes’ is great stuff. But it’s not going to precipitate the development of a new airplane.”

Scherer says Airbus is “quite happy” with the performance of the A350, and adds the company is witnessing “a lot of interest on the widebodies coming back”.

“We need to come out of this pandemic and we need to so soberly, with solid transactions,” he says. “We’re not so much in the business of rehashing old deals, we’re looking forward, so I’m quite confident.”"

Boeing reports solid deliveries, 737 MAX rate increase.

by J. Kasper Oestergaard, European Correspondent, Forecast International.

Boeing and Airbus delivered 51 and 58 commercial jets in June 2022, compared to 45 and 77 deliveries, respectively, in the same month last year. Year to date, Boeing and Airbus have delivered 216 and 295 aircraft, compared to 156 and 297, respectively, in the first half of 2021. So far this year, Boeing is 60 deliveries ahead and Airbus is two deliveries behind last year’s totals. June was a strong month for Boeing, and one would have to go all the way back to March 2019 to find a month with higher shipments.

Following a more than challenging 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2021 was a year of recovery for the two largest commercial plane makers. 2022 is well underway and is expected to be another year of recovery for the commercial aircraft manufacturing industry, despite events currently unfolding in Ukraine. Boeing and Airbus still have a long way to go before deliveries are back to pre-pandemic levels, though.

For the full year 2021, Boeing delivered 340 aircraft, compared to 157 in 2020 and 380 in 2019. Boeing’s last “normal” year was 2018 – before COVID-19 and the 737 MAX grounding – when it delivered 806 jets, a level that will likely not be recaptured before 2024 or 2025. The past three years have been extremely challenging for Boeing but, despite ongoing Dreamliner quality issues and 777X delays, the outlook is bright.

The 737 MAX is approved to fly in nearly every country, and since late 2020 the fleet has flown more than one million flight hours. The aircraft, however, has not yet returned to commercial service in China despite the fact that the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) ungrounded the 737 MAX in December of last year. For example, China Eastern Airlines recently announced that aircraft modifications and further pilot training are needed before it can resume commercial service with the aircraft. The top reason for the 737 MAX’s absence in the skies over China is most likely the nation’s zero-COVID approach, which has wreaked havoc on domestic air travel; hence, there has been no need to add the 737 MAX capacity. In mid-June it was reported that China Southern Airlines is making test flights, as domestic demand is now looking to pick up again. In July, Air China also carried out a test flight with a 737 MAX.

In 2021, Airbus delivered 611 aircraft and won the deliveries crown for the third year in a row. Deliveries were up from 566 in 2020 but remain well below the company’s all-time record high of 863 shipments in 2019. Airbus is expected to retain the deliveries lead for the foreseeable future due to the company’s comfortable backlog lead over its American rival. Prior to 2019, Boeing had out-delivered Airbus every year since 2012.

As indicated above, in June 2022, Boeing delivered 51 jets, including 44 737s (43 MAX / 1 NG), four 767s, and three 777s. As of June, the 737 program is producing aircraft at an official rate of 31 per month, up from 27 per month in May. The rate of 27 per month was maintained between November 2021 and May 2022 and, prior to that, the monthly rate was just 19. Recently, The Seattle Times reported that delays in the supply of parts had resulted in a slowdown in 737 MAX production. Despite the rate increase and strong 737 MAX deliveries in June in general, supply chain issues are likely to persist for the time being. According to Reuters, Boeing has preliminary plans to boost 737 production to 38 jets per month in the first half of 2023, followed by another increase to 47 jets per month by the end of 2023.

Boeing 787 Dreamliner deliveries have now been suspended for more than a year, and it is unknown exactly when shipments will resume. Boeing suspended Dreamliner deliveries in May 2021 for the second time in less than a year. The Federal Aviation Administration is reviewing Boeing’s method for inspecting and evaluating the aircraft to ensure it meets federal safety regulations. In February, the head of the FAA, Steve Dickson, stated that the agency needs a “systemic fix” from Boeing to address Dreamliner production issues and would not allow the company to self-certify individual new jets when deliveries resume. Boeing recently advised key airlines and parts suppliers that Dreamliner deliveries would resume in the second half of 2022. In June, Bloomberg reported that Boeing is “almost there” with regard to restarting 787 deliveries. The current 787 production rate is approximately two aircraft per month, and Boeing expects to continue at this rate until deliveries resume and then return to five per month over time. In March of this year it was reported that the company is currently testing the ability of suppliers to meet output scenarios as high as seven per month by the end of 2023.

The 777 program was expected to get a new addition in late 2023 with the first delivery of the 777X, but in April Boeing announced this will now not happen before 2025. This reflects an updated assessment of the time required to meet certification requirements. According to Boeing, the 777-9 production rate ramp-up is being adjusted to minimize inventory and the number of planes requiring “change incorporation,” including a temporary pause through 2023. However, Boeing is taking advantage of the adjustment to the 777-9 production schedule by adding 777 freighter capacity starting in late 2023. In January of this year, Boeing launched a new 777X-based freighter, thereby expanding its 777X and cargo portfolio. Qatar Airways will be the 777-8F launch customer.

In June 2022, Airbus delivered 58 jets, including six A220s, 47 A320s (all NEO), two A330s, and three A350s. During 2021, Airbus steadily increased A320 production from 40 per month to 43 in Q3 2021 before finishing the year at a rate of 45 per month. Production will continue to be increased until reaching a monthly rate of 65 by the summer of 2023. Airbus has also discussed a scenario with a rate of 70 by Q1 2024. On May 4, Guillaume Faury, the CEO of Airbus, announced that the company continues to see strong growth in commercial aircraft demand driven by the A320 family. As a result, Airbus is now working with its supply chain to increase the A320 production rate to 75 aircraft per month in 2025. The A321XLR successfully accomplished its first flight on June 15, 2022. Entry into service, initially planned for the end of 2023, is now expected to take place in early 2024.

The A220, meanwhile, is being produced at a rate of five aircraft per month. The rate will be increased to six in the coming months – with a monthly production rate of 14 envisioned by the middle of the decade. The A350 production rate currently averages five per month and will be increased to six by early 2023. Airbus is currently producing two A330s per month, a rate that will be increased to nearly three aircraft by the end of 2022.

In 2021, Airbus launched the new A350 freighter, or A350F, which is a major and much-needed boost to the company’s competitiveness in the cargo segment. Boeing has long dominated the cargo space with its 737-800BCF, 767-300BCF, 767-300F, 777F, 777-8F and 747-8F offerings. Until now, Airbus has only offered the A330-200F, which has not performed well in competition against Boeing’s popular 767-300F. With the launch of the A350F, it appears Airbus is getting serious about capturing more of the cargo aircraft market. The A350F, which carries up to 120 tons (109 metric tons) of cargo, received its first order in November and will predominantly compete with the 777F. In comparison, the 777F has a cargo capacity of up to 112 tons (102 metric tons). To date, the A350F has accumulated 31 net new orders.

Turning to the June orders review, both companies had a satisfactory month. Boeing booked orders from three customers for a total of 50 jets. However, the company also reported 35 cancellations (29 737 MAXs and six 787s), resulting in just 15 net new orders in total. The largest order, for 48 737 MAXs, was placed by an undisclosed customer. Also, FedEx Express ordered a single 777F. Finally, American Airlines ordered a single 737 MAX for the second consecutive month. Year to date, Boeing has accumulated 186 net new orders (286 gross orders). In 2021, Boeing booked 909 gross orders and received 430 cancellations, for a total of 479 net new orders (before ASC 606 changes). Please note that for comparison reasons, we do not include the so-called ASC 606 accounting adjustments in the numbers reported in this article and regard net new orders as gross orders minus cancellations.

In June, Airbus booked orders from seven customers for a total of 78 jets and reported 10 cancellations, resulting in 68 net new orders. The largest order by far was placed by Qantas Airways and included 20 A220-300s, 20 A321XLRs and 12 A350-1000s. The Qantas order was announced in early May but not finalized before last month. Also, an undisclosed customer ordered seven A350 freighters and Turkish low-cost carrier Pegasus Airlines booked eight A321neos. Finally, International Airlines Group (IAG) ordered five A320neos and one A321neo, Silk Way West Airlines booked two A350Fs, and Delta Air Lines placed an order for a single A330-900.

Year to date, Airbus has accumulated 259 net new orders (442 gross orders). In 2021, Airbus booked a total of 771 gross orders and received 264 cancellations, for a total of 507 net new orders – enough to win the orders crown for the third year in a row. It should be noted, however, that if Boeing’s 2021 ASC 606 adjustments are included, Boeing comes out ahead with 535 net new orders.

It will be very interesting to track the ordering activity at this month’s Farnborough International Airshow. Given the current economic uncertainty and resurgence of COVID in some parts of the world, it is unknown if airlines and leasing companies will have an appetite for fleet renewal and expansion or if they are in wait-and-see mode. What we do know is that Airbus will likely present a major order for as many as 292 A320neo family aircraft combined for Air China, China Eastern, China Southern, and Shenzhen Airlines. The order was announced in early July but has not yet been firmed up. Also, rumors are circulating that Delta Air Lines is close to ordering more than 100 Boeing 737 MAX 10 narrowbody jets.

At the end of June 2022, Airbus reported a backlog of 7,046 jets, of which 6,376, or 90 percent, were A220 and A320ceo/neo family narrowbodies. This is 679 aircraft below the company’s all-time backlog record of 7,725 aircraft set in January 2020. By the end of June, Boeing’s backlog (total unfilled orders before ASC 606 adjustment) was 5,106 aircraft, of which 4,101, or 80 percent, were 737 NG/MAX narrowbody jets. Boeing’s all-time backlog high of 5,964 aircraft was set in August 2018. The number of Airbus aircraft to be built and delivered represents 8.2 years of shipments at the 2019 production level (the pre-pandemic level), or 11.5 years based on the 2021 total. In comparison, Boeing’s backlog would “only” last 6.3 years at the 2018 level (the most recent “normal” year for Boeing), or 15.0 years based on 2021 deliveries. In 2022 to date, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio, calculated as net new orders divided by deliveries, is 0.86. Airbus’ book-to-bill ratio is 0.88. In 2021, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio was 1.41, while Airbus reported a book-to-bill of 0.81.

Airbus climbs past Boeing in single-aisle market share - Financial Times,"Sun, 17 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2MwODY0MmY1LTNhYTMtNDQ3Yi05MDI4LWMxYzg0YjhlMTBmZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Print this page

Airbus and Boeing have competed neck and neck for five decades in one of the world’s great commercial rivalries. But, as the contest resumes in earnest in the wake of the pandemic, the old order has changed. Airbus now has a wide lead in the single-aisle market — the hottest area of aviation — leaving Boeing to grapple with how to bridge the gap.

The European company has grabbed new orders and market share with its popular A320 family of narrow-body jets, which predominantly serve shorter-haul destinations, to which travel has rebounded faster, compared with long-haul flights.

Latest figures to the end of June show that Airbus had close to 17,000 orders of its A320 and A220 aircraft, and has so far delivered just over 10,600. The A320 is now the bestselling aircraft ever, overtaking US-based Boeing’s 737 jet.

Recent fleet data from aviation consultancy Cirium showed Airbus’s A320 family with a “firm order backlog” market share of 59 per cent compared with Boeing’s 737 family of jets.

The bestseller within the A320 family is its largest model, the A321neo, which is also offered with extra fuel tanks in long-range and extra-long range variants. Some airlines — such as America’s JetBlue — now use these for long-haul flights that were traditionally flown by more expensive wide-body jets.

Airbus’s market share is only likely to grow as the group moves ahead with aggressive plans to lift output of the jets to 75 a month by 2025, despite industry-wide concerns about constraints in the supply chain. Production had reached a record 60 a month in 2019 before dropping to 40 a month when Covid hit.

Some analysts have questioned when Boeing will be able to regain some of that lost market share, as the company has continued to deal with fallout from the grounding of its 737 Max 8 after two fatal crashes within five months.

Global regulators have since cleared the jet to fly again after Boeing implemented software and design changes and the plane is notching up new orders.

Another challenge looming, however, is the recertification of the shorter 737 Max 7 and longer 737 Max 10 variants. Boeing is racing to complete those processes before the end of the year to avoid having to develop a new flight deck under rules introduced by US Congress following the Max crashes.

I have a lot of time for Dave Calhoun . . . but he’s not in Seattle and the problems in Boeing lie in Seattle

Boeing has also suffered production issues that have prevented customer deliveries of its wide-body 787 aircraft. In addition, development of its 777X aircraft has been delayed, while problems on a number of big defence contracts have only added to the challenges.

Union representatives, meanwhile, have criticised the company’s decision to move its global headquarters from Chicago to Washington, DC — seen as taking it further away from its spiritual home, the commercial aircraft factories of Seattle, and adding to persistent questions over the quality of its engineering.

Repeated delays on the commercial side have frustrated some of Boeing’s largest customers, including Ryanair. The low-cost carrier’s chief executive, Michael O’Leary, has said sweeping changes are needed to Boeing’s senior management led by chief executive Dave Calhoun.

In a recent interview, O’Leary told the Financial Times that the US aviation group has “lost huge market share and existing customers are being lost to Airbus, which is why I don’t understand why they sit there and do nothing”.

“I have a lot of time for Dave Calhoun . . . but he’s not in Seattle and the problems in Boeing lie in Seattle,” he said.

But others, including Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr, have continued to back the US company. Boeing has insisted that things have changed since the Max accidents. It is also ramping up the hiring of engineers as it works with the US aviation regulator to certify its upcoming 777X aircraft.

However, in a further blow, Boeing last month lost out to Airbus on a $37bn order from China’s three big state airlines. They chose 290 A320neo jets — the biggest order by Chinese airlines since the start of the pandemic. The country is a crucial market for both Airbus and Boeing and the orders come at a time of rising political tensions between the US and China.

Calhoun has previously cited uncertainty over orders from China as one of the three main risks facing the company, along with securely boosting production of the Max and resolving issues around the 787. China was the first country to ground the Max and, although its aviation regulator last year approved its return to service, Chinese carriers have not started flying the plane commercially again.

The multibillion-dollar question facing Boeing, therefore, is how to recover its lead against Airbus, at the same time as China’s first self-developed aircraft — Comac’s narrow-body C919 — is finally nearing completion.

Boeing abandoned a plan for a new midsize aeroplane — a twin-aisle aircraft that would have sat between the 737 Max and the larger 787 — and it remains unclear what its next step will be. Its balance sheet also remains constrained, with some $45bn of net debt.

$45bn Net debt on Boeing balance sheet

The company needs to “launch an answer to the A321neo,” says Kevin Michaels, managing director of Michigan-based AeroDynamic Advisory. “Can they afford it? I think they can. Their balance sheet isn’t great but you’ve got to invest in your core business to stay around in the long run.”

“The other problem they face is knowing what to do — if you do press the button, how do you do that plane? The world is about to change massively but no one yet knows what that technology will be and you could end up spending $20bn on something that will be immediately obsolete,” says Nick Cunningham, analyst at research firm Agency Partners in London, who believes the company needs to raise equity to fund a new programme.

But Calhoun has recently played down any concerns about the company’s market share position vis-à-vis Airbus. “At this moment in time, it’s less important,” he told an investor conference in June. Boeing, he added, had to concentrate on getting planes back in the air.

“We have to stay focused on doing that incredibly well. One aeroplane at a time. If I jump to a market share discussion immediately and say, ‘Let’s get above 50 and let’s do it next year’, what happens? The whole system gets crammed down in every way.”

He also indicated at the same conference that the company might not launch anything new for at least another couple of years. He does not believe that the performance improvement to justify an all new aircraft currently exists.

Boeing, he said, was sure it had the ability to compete. “I’m confident, my sales team is confident,” said Calhoun. “Our customers express confidence to me, so why would I rush? No good reason.”

The best flying experience ever: Introducing Virgin Atlantic's Airbus A330neo | Virgin - Virgin,"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpcmdpbi5jb20vYWJvdXQtdmlyZ2luL2xhdGVzdC90aGUtYmVzdC1mbHlpbmctZXhwZXJpZW5jZS1ldmVyLWludHJvZHVjaW5nLXZpcmdpbi1hdGxhbnRpY3MtYWlyYnVzLWEzMzBuZW_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Flying is about to get even better – Virgin Atlantic has revealed its new Airbus A330neo, with a premium, personalised experience for every single customer.

The Airbus A330neo will be the first aircraft in Virgin Atlantic’s fleet with a brand-new Upper Class seat, a refreshed social space, and The Retreat Suite – the most spacious suite in Virgin Atlantic’s history.

Virgin Atlantic Virgin Atlantic

The Retreat Suite is a brand new innovation in Virgin Atlantic’s Upper Class offering. It consists of two exclusive suites at the front of the cabin, with a 6ft7” direct seat to fully flat bed and a 27” touchscreen with Bluetooth connectivity and wireless charging. With each suite boasting an ottoman that doubles up as an extra seat, up to four people can comfortably dine, chat or play games in their own private social space.

As well as The Retreat Suite, the A330neo will offer 30 brand new Upper Class suites. The fully forward-facing suite offers more space and storage, with a fully closing privacy door. A ‘do not disturb’ feature means you can enjoy your flight in peace, sleeping the whole way if you’d rather not be woken up for meals. It also had passenger-controlled mood lighting, a 17.3” touchscreen TV and even a mirror so you can check you’re runway ready before you land.

Virgin Atlantic

The Loft, Virgin Atlantic’s award-winning social space, remains a core part of the Upper Class experience. In an evolution of design from the Airbus A350, it has space for eight people, with four comfortable seats, allowing guests to sit and chat or enjoy refreshments from the new self-service fridge and drinks dispenser. And you can connect Bluetooth headphones to one of the dual panoramic 27” touchscreens, or charge your devices on the wireless facilities.

Premium and Economy

Upper Class isn’t the only cabin that’s had an upgrade. The new Premium cabin has 46 38” pitch seats, which are all accompanied by calf rests and a 13.3” touchscreen with Bluetooth audio. Plus, Premium customers will also be able to wirelessly charge their gadgets at their seats.

Virgin Atlantic

In the new Economy cabin, comfort and connection are the order of the day. Customers will get to enjoy the largest ever economy screen at 13.3”, with an intuitive touchscreen and Bluetooth audio to connect headphones – and the ability to use their phones as a controller. There’s also plenty of storage, and AC power and USB ports to keep gadgets powered up. Customers have the choice between 28 Economy Delight seats, which offer an increased 34” seat pitch, or 156 Economy Classic seats, providing a 31” pitch.

Virgin Atlantic

Corneel Koster, chief customer and operating officer at Virgin Atlantic, said: “When it comes to innovating for our customers, we never stand still. Our desire to create memorable experiences means we’ll continue to imagine with fresh ideas. We care about every detail of the cabin design and every step of our customer’s journey. We’re proud to unveil our state-of-the-art A330neo and show the evolution of our customer experience, with each of our customers receiving a premium experience regardless of the cabin they travel in. They’ll be better connected with their fellow travellers and our amazing crew in the air, and with their friends and family on the ground.”

Cleanest, greenest fleet

Back in 2019, Virgin Atlantic became the first UK airline to announce a firm order for up to 16 Airbus A330neos, reaffirming its commitment to flying the cleanest, greenest fleet in the sky. The airline has made a multi-billion dollar investment in its fleet over the last decade, operating with the average aircraft age of just under seven years and 68% next generation aircraft. This will increase to 100% next generation aircraft by the beginning of 2027 – meaning all of Virgin Atlantic’s planes are equipped with the most efficient engines and state-of-the-art technology designed to save fuel and reduce emissions. Already, the investment in its fleet has delivered a 20% reduction in Virgin Atlantic’s fleet carbon emissions.

Corneel added: “The A330neo plays a significant role in our multi-billion dollar fleet transformation, demonstrating our commitment to the planet. We know the most impactful thing we can do as an airline is to fly the cleanest, greenest, youngest fleet possible and the A330neo is integral to achieving this goal. It’s truly a plane for the future.”

Virgin Atlantic

Over the next decade, Virgin Atlantic will save another 10% in carbon emissions. The Airbus A330-900 neos are designed to be 11% more fuel and carbon efficient than the A330-330 aircraft that they are replacing in Virgin Atlantic’s fleet – and they’ll deliver a 50% reduction in airport noise contour.

Virgin Atlantic’s first A330neo is expected to take off to Boston on its first customer flight in early October. Tickets will go on sale later this month. From September 2022, the airline will take delivery of three aircraft, with the remaining deliveries following between 2023 and 2026.

The agreement will cover 41 aircraft, via lease and via direct purchase. The aircraft will be powered by Pratt & Whitney engines.

“Following Condor’s earlier decision to order the A330neo for its long-haul network, we are double grateful the airline has now also selected the Airbus A320neo Family to modernise its single-aisle-fleet following a thorough evaluation process. We are proud of such a strong vote of confidence and welcome Condor as a future all-Airbus operator,” says Christian Scherer, Chief Commercial Officer and Head of Airbus International.

""After we will have replaced our entire long-haul fleet with state-of-the-art 2-liter aircraft by the beginning of 2024, it is the logical next step for us to modernize our short- and medium-haul fleet as well. With our new A320neo and A321neo aircraft, we are consistently developing our fleet and ourselves as a company, and also taking care of our own aspiration to enable responsible and at the same time comfortable travel with significantly reduced CO2 emissions, significantly lower fuel consumption and less noise,"" says Ralf Teckentrup, CEO of Condor.

By operating the A320neo and A330neo aircraft side by side, Condor will benefit from the commonality economics these two aircraft Families offer. Condor has been operating the A320 for more than 20 years on its network in Europe. The new A320neo fleet will feature the Airbus Airspace Cabin, offering passengers the highest level of comfort.

At the end of June 2022 the A320neo Family had totalled more than 8,100 orders from over 130 customers. Thanks to modern engines and improved aerodynamics, the A320 Family models reduce fuel burn and CO2 emissions by at least 20% compared to its previous generation competitor as well as 50% noise reduction. Since its Entry into Service six years ago, Airbus has delivered over 2,300 A320neo Family aircraft contributing to 15 million tons of CO2 saving.

Rhineland-Palatinate orders two H145 helicopters for its police force - Airbus,"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wNy1yaGluZWxhbmQtcGFsYXRpbmF0ZS1vcmRlcnMtdHdvLWgxNDUtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtZm9yLWl0cy1wb2xpY2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Farnborough, The Ministry of Interior of Rhineland-Palatinate has ordered two five-bladed Airbus H145s for its police force, following a European tender launched earlier this year. The helicopters will replace the state’s current H135 fleet and will be operated by the police helicopters squadron in Winningen. The first delivery is planned for Q1 2024.



“We’d like to thank the Rhineland-Palatinate government for its continued trust in our helicopters”, says Wolfgang Schoder, Managing Director of Airbus Helicopters in Germany. “These five-bladed H145s will be outfitted with highly sophisticated equipment in order to further enhance the mission capabilities of the police force. We have seen with the flooding last year that law enforcement operators need to be able to rely on helicopters that can perform these demanding and essential missions and the H145 does just that.”



There are more than 200 helicopters from the H145 helicopter family deployed for public services and law enforcement missions around the world.



The new version of Airbus’ best-selling H145 light twin-engine helicopter was unveiled at Heli-Expo 2019 in Atlanta. This latest upgrade adds a new, innovative five-bladed rotor to the multi-mission H145, increasing the useful load of the helicopter by 150 kg. The simplicity of the new bearingless main rotor design also eases maintenance operations, further improving the benchmark serviceability and reliability of the H145, while improving ride comfort for both passengers and crew.



In total, there are more than 1,500 H145 family helicopters in service, logging a total of more than six million flight hours. Powered by two Safran Arriel 2E engines, the H145 is equipped with full authority digital engine control (FADEC) and the Helionix digital avionics suite. It includes a high performance 4-axis autopilot, increasing safety and reducing pilot workload. Its particularly low acoustic footprint makes the H145 the quietest helicopter in its class.

"Airbus, Boeing Reveal New Progress on Autonomous Refueling - Air & Space Forces Magazine","Wed, 20 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmFuZHNwYWNlZm9yY2VzLmNvbS9haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLXJldmVhbC1uZXctcHJvZ3Jlc3Mtb24tYXV0b25vbW91cy1yZWZ1ZWxpbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Share Article

FARNBOROUGH, U.K.—The defense contractors vying for the Air Force’s tentative “bridge tanker” program updated the status of their aerial refuelers this week at the Farnborough International Airshow, citing new capabilities aimed at automating the refueling process.

Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall has repeatedly said the likelihood of a competition for the service’s “bridge tanker” program has gone down in recent months, a seeming endorsement of Boeing’s KC-46 Pegasus and a blow to the LMXT, the alternative proposed by Lockheed Martin and Airbus.

Lockheed Martin, however, continues to state publicly that it believes there will be a competition for the KC-Y program meant to “bridge” the gap between the end of the KC-46 and a next-generation refueling family of systems.

“Our expectation is that the Secretary and the department will continue to go through the requirements and that we’ll have the opportunity to compete fairly,” Erin Moseley, Lockheed Martin’s vice president for strategy and business development for aeronautics, told reporters.

At the same time, Moseley sought to highlight the differences between the LMXT and the KC-46, saying they would “complement” each other and that the LMXT would demonstrate “real technological advances … that could also then segue into what [a future tanker] might look like.”

Airbus cited some of those new technologies developed for its A330 MRTT, on which the LMXT is based. Specifically, the contractor announced that its fully automatic air-to-air refueling system has achieved new milestones, successfully collaborating with the Republic of Singapore Air Force and receiving certification from a Spanish agency to conduct operations in daylight.

Airbus has been working on the system for several years now. It is designed to reduce the workload of the boom operator by using software to fly the boom automatically, keep alignment between the boom tip and the receiver receptacle, extend and retract the telescopic beam, and initiate and terminate the refueling process, all while the boom operator monitors the process.

On top of that, Airbus introduced a new program, Auto’Mate, aimed at developing, testing, and integrating technology that will allow for autonomous air-to-air refueling. The company is hoping to test that tech by 2023.

In response, Boeing revealed that the KC-46 Pegasus tanker has conducted flight tests demonstrating autonomous boom aerial refueling, but in a briefing with reporters, senior regional director of international business development for Europe and the Americas Tim Flood declined to share any more details about that testing, including when it occurred or what exactly it demonstrated.

“This is all part of our ongoing internal development program,” Flood said. “We’re bringing a range of features, including autonomy, to the KC-46, and as part of that broader development and flight test program, and we’re incorporating these types of new improvements and testing them.”

At the same time, Flood seemed to downplay the importance of making sure the KC-46 can autonomously refuel.

“It’s not the only important thing to provide the Air Force,” said Flood. “It’s all about providing capability for aerial refueling. So right now the U.S. Air Force has delivered over 80 million pounds of fuel [with the KC-46], so it’s not hampering the success to deliver.”

The Air Force has been pursuing automated and autonomous refueling for years now, and autonomous refueling operations, for both tankers and receivers, was listed as a potential requirement in the service’s recent request for information starting the new Advanced Aerial Refueling Family of Systems program.

Boeing does have some experience in the field. In 2009, the Air Force Research Laboratory gave the company a contract to explore the technology, and in 2021, its MQ-25 drone completed its first aerial refueling of an F-35C as part of a Navy program.

But when asked if Boeing could apply what it had learned from the MQ-25 for the KC-Z program, Flood demurred. Instead, he emphasized that the contractor’s main focus is on delivering the KC-46. The program has been plagued by issues, most prominently with the Remote Vision System, but the Air Force has closed the preliminary design review for the system’s successor, RVS 2.0, and Flood said the company is now on a “steady path” in that regard.

As for Boeing’s second priority, “we’re really excited about KC-Y,” Flood said. “We’re going to focus on what that requirement looks like, what the Air Force strategy is, and then focus on that.”"

Satellite imagery: protecting the environment and assisting humanitarian aid - Airbus,"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTA3LXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1pbWFnZXJ5LXByb3RlY3RpbmctdGhlLWVudmlyb25tZW50LWFuZC1hc3Npc3RpbmctaHVtYW5pdGFyaWFu0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Every year, the Airbus Foundation delivers satellite imagery covering tens of thousands of square kilometres around the globe to support its partners involved in humanitarian aid and protecting the environment. As the number of requests continues to grow, the Foundation has significantly extended the range of products and services offered – including new types of imagery, photo interpretation analysis support and training sessions to increase the partners’ ability to understand and analyse what they’re seeing.

How do you facilitate the supply of imagery from Airbus Defence and Space in support of the Airbus Foundation’s partners?

As the focal point for the Airbus Foundation’s partners in anything related to satellite imagery, I help them understand how such imagery can support their actions – either in emergency situations or for longer-term risk or impact assessment. I coordinate with the Foundation and within Airbus Defence and Space to ensure these partners have access to the right imagery and are assisted in their projects when they need guidance or training.

The Foundation’s partner requests have increased each year: in 2021 we provided imagery that covered nearly 50,000 km².

I am convinced that satellite images will be more and more useful in finding the right answers to protect our environment and assisting those in need. I am proud to be part of a group that allows me to give some of my time and to leverage its resources for a philanthropic activity directly related to current global issues that are so crucial today, and for the next generations.

Has the requirement for satellite imagery changed over the years, and how has the Airbus Foundation adapted?

The Foundation has learned to understand the full cycles of crises and better integrate prevention into its scope of activities. Preventing environmental disasters and responding to climate change are now major development axes.

Additionally, after several years of supporting NGOs (non-governmental organisations) with satellite imagery, it became increasingly clear that many humanitarian crises have environmental roots. In support of the Airbus Foundation, the Airbus team currently provides satellite imagery to several humanitarian organisations including Action against Hunger, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the Global Logistics Cluster and the Foreign Affairs’ Crisis and Support Centre (CDCS). In addition, it is now also supporting environmental partners such as the Connected Conservation Foundation (CCF) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).



How are the NGOs benefitting from Airbus Foundation-supplied imagery, which gives them a “space-eye” view of affected areas?

Satellite imagery is directly benefitting NGOs by easily visualising areas impacted by a natural disaster, for example, and organising their response while quickly assessing the local situation, verifying the road conditions and planning rescue activities accordingly.

As the NGOs also have the possibility to task our satellites for specific area coverage, they can receive new images when needed and compare them with older ones: for instance, to track movements of refugees, in monitoring the impact of river flooding and seeing the effects of drought.

I am convinced that satellite images will be more and more useful in finding the right answers to protect our environment, and assisting those in need.

Louise Bellemère

How does the relationship with environmental partners differ from those involved in humanitarian-related actions?

The way we work with environmental partners – such as CCF and IUCN – is very different from what we do with the humanitarian organisations, as it is more project-based, with clear predefined delivery targets.

With CCF, the intention is to protect endangered species and their habitats across protected areas, with this organisation’s teams using satellite imagery to identify movement of wildlife and detect poaching threats. We have helped them obtain the optimum satellite images at the right time so they could effectively see animals and synchronise with field teams. Using our 30cm resolution Pléiades Neo images, they were able to identify a tragic poaching incident by spotting the carcasses of three deceased rhinos, which allowed park rangers to understand the time of death. This satellite imagery will also equip the park with up-to-date road maps for tactical deployment resource and help monitor the successful impact of rewilding efforts.

The IUCN project has the goal of mapping forest restoration in certain areas to verify where exactly the forest is being restored. We have a dedicated team working on this project, and regular progress meetings are held with the organisation.

How will the Pleiades Neo satellites help NGOs make their work easier?

The new Pléiades Neo constellation opens up a wide range of applications; it’s very exciting! The CCF already has been using Pléiades Neo images to detect large animals such as elephants and rhinos. In addition to delivering the highest resolution available on the market, the Pléiades Neo satellites also offer at least two revisits a day anywhere on Earth and better agility for emergency tasking. The additional Deep Blue spectral band that can be used for hydrological and bathymetry applications will certainly unlock new possibilities in protecting our oceans and monitoring waterholes in drought-affected areas.

What is next in viewing the world from different angles?

There are many things that we can imagine for the future! The Airbus OneAtlas platform – which provides access to satellite imagery, innovative geospatial analytics and industry-specific insights – as well as the global trend of digitalisation will definitely help more and more organisations access our Airbus data, even in remote areas.

Numerous NGOs are developing their own geomatic skills, and we must keep on supporting them in this development, as it is key that they understand the value of satellite imagery and know how to extract knowledge and insights on specific disaster management cases. In terms of applications, the range is infinite. Furthermore, a number of machine-learning algorithms that will make it possible to detect more and more endangered animal species, and specific types of crops and terrain while analysing their health.

The progress in 3D modelling also will enable better assessment of landslide or mudslide risks, and help build preventive action. Additionally, Airbus’ Zephyr high-altitude pseudo satellites that is currently under development will be capable of flying continuously for months over crisis areas, providing images with 18-cm resolution."

The Flight Test Demonstrator aims to mature and accelerate the development of advanced propulsion technologies, as part of CFM’s Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engine (RISE) demonstration program, on board an Airbus A380. The flight test campaign will be performed in the second half of this decade from the Airbus Flight Test facility in Toulouse, France. Ahead of the A380 test flights, CFM will perform engine ground tests, along with flight test validation at GE Aviation’s Flight Test Operations centre in Victorville, CA, USA.

The flight test program will achieve several objectives that could contribute to future engine and aircraft efficiency improvements, including: enhanced understanding of engine/wing integration and aerodynamic performance as well as propulsive system efficiency gains; validating performance benefits, including better fuel efficiency that would provide a 20%* reduction in CO2 emissions compared to today’s most efficient engines; evaluating acoustic models; and ensuring compatibility with 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF).

“New propulsion technologies will play an important role in achieving aviation's net-zero objectives, along with new aircraft designs and sustainable energy sources,” said Sabine Klauke, Airbus Chief Technical Officer. “By evaluating, maturing and validating open fan engine architecture using a dedicated flight test demonstrator, we are collaboratively making yet another significant contribution to the advancement of technology bricks that will enable us to reach our industry-wide decarbonisation targets.”

“The CFM RISE Program is all about pushing the technology envelope, redefining the art of the possible, and helping to achieve more sustainable long-term growth for our industry,” said Gaël Méheust, President and CEO of CFM International. “CFM, its parent companies, and Airbus all share the same vision and commitment for the future; the open fan flight test demonstration program is an exciting next step toward achieving the industry’s net-zero goals.”

This collaboration with CFM highlights the diversity of Airbus’ technology demonstrator portfolio and complements the work being carried out to evaluate concepts and mature technologies for Airbus’ zero-emission ambition. In February 2022, the two companies announced a joint flight test program to validate hydrogen propulsion capability.

Airbus and CFM, along with parent companies GE and Safran, share the ambition of fulfilling the promise they made in signing the Air Transport Action Group goal in October 2021 to achieve aviation industry net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 by developing and testing the technology necessary to make zero emissions aircraft a reality within the ambitious timeline defined.

Airbus has a long-standing relationship with CFM and its parent companies, GE Aviation and Safran and, together, the partners have established a great track record of delivering high-performance products that meet the needs of airline customers.

Experimental Zephyr drone sets new record for uncrewed flight duration - Space.com,"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS9haXJidXMtemVwaHlyLWRyb25lLWxvbmctZW5kdXJhbmNlLWZsaWdodC1yZWNvcmTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An experimental aircraft tested in conjunction with the United States Army has been in the air above the Sonoran Desert for 42 days, breaking its own record for longest uncrewed flight.

The solar-powered, high-altitude Airbus Zephyr S took off from the U.S. Army's Yuma Proving Ground on June 15, 2022 and has since been flying patterns over the Yuma Test Range and Kofa National Wildlife Refuge.

The flight has now broken Zephyr's previous record of 25 days, 23 hours that it set in August 2018. The latest flight has seen Zephyr reach a number of additional milestones including its first flight over water, first flight into international airspace, the longest continuous flight while being controlled through satellite communications, and the farthest flight from its launch point, according to a U.S. Army statement .

Zephyr features a narrow, almost skeletal-looking fuselage and wings boasting a wingspan of 82 feet (25 meters). Despite its large size, the drone is made from lightweight carbon fiber composites, bringing its overall weight down to just 165 pounds (75 kilograms).

Airbus describes Zephyr as ""the first stratospheric UAS of its kind"" which is able to fly continuously for spans of months at a time. The aircraft is known as a ""High Altitude Platform Station,"" or HAPS, sometimes referred to as a pseudo-satellite. This class of aircraft is designed to remain aloft for extended periods while using solar energy to charge its onboard batteries, which are then used to keep the aircraft flying at night. Thanks to its energy storage system, Airbus claims Zephyr's in-flight operation is completely carbon neutral.

Zephyr can carry a wide range of payloads of up to 50 pounds (22.5 kg) including optical, infrared, LIDAR and hyperspectral sensors, radar and synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and even early warning systems. Because the drone operates at altitudes of around 70,000 feet (21,340 m), it is able to observe an area on the ground measuring 12 by 18 miles (20 by 30 kilometers).

These capabilities, along with Zephyr's unique endurance abilities, make it well-suited for operations such as maritime security or border surveillance, where it could continuously stand watch over a given location for up to weeks at a time.

Because Zephyr flies at such high altitudes for such long periods, it could also be used as a communications relay platform, sending signals between other aircraft and ground stations, for example, that are too far from one another to establish a line-of-sight link on their own. “Our connectivity services will provide a viable alternative and complement to terrestrial and satellite-based connectivity solutions, allowing for the first time low-latency and direct-to-device connectivity across vast geographies, and economically,"" Airbus said in a statement .

After its current record-breaking flight concludes, Zephyr will next be tested over the Pacific Ocean while carrying a U.S. Army-developed payload in the coming weeks."

There are three fundamental areas for the Air Mobility Initiative: the eVTOL aircraft, the ground infrastructure, and the unmanned traffic management. With a €86-million (US$87-million) budget and three years to accomplish its scheduled projects, we spoke with Markus May, head of operations for urban air mobility (UAM) at Airbus, Ivonne Kuger, executive vice president of corporate development at Munich Airport International, and Jan Eric Putze, CEO of Droniq GmbH, to find out more about the initiative and what we can expect to see by 2025.

The following is an interview with Markus May — the first in a three-part article series discussing the AMI. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

eVTOL.com: Having an entrepreneurial mindset in a corporate environment is very difficult to achieve and you were able to achieve it. How did you start the Airbus Urban Mobility GmbH?

Markus May: In 2018, we started Airbus Urban Mobility as a field of expertise. We come from an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) background. Airbus is excellent at designing, manufacturing, and developing aircraft and helicopters. But it is not just about a flying vehicle. We needed to address different pillars of the value chain and get a whole ecosystem to work together. We created a smaller entity with startup principles because we were — and still are — looking for a product-market fit.

We investigate two areas: developing an eVTOL aircraft, which is the CityAirbus NextGen, and being the architect of an air mobility transport system for cities and communities. Along with the three technical pillars [eVTOL aircraft, ground infrastructure, and air traffic management services] there are also other foundational aspects that we’ll need to address, like social acceptance, regulation, safety and security, as well as a user-centric design.

eVTOL.com: Can you explain what the Air Mobility Initiative is and what the group aims to accomplish?

Markus May: We want to build an MVP, a minimum viable product, for an air mobility transport system in an urban environment. That means we want to fly a passenger from point A (an airport) to point B (a city environment) with a vehicle like the CityAirbus NextGen. To do so, a U-space in the urban environment will be set up in order to create visibility amongst the different actors in the lower airspace.

With all these factors involved, our ambition is to make the whole transport system work together with all necessary players of the ecosystem. We are not replacing anything that currently exists. We are adding a complimentary means of transportation to an existing urban transportation system. Beyond that, we want to make sure that it is accessible to the public and an easy choice for the citizen who needs to commute between cities or communities.

Since 2020, we have been building a foundation with 30 partners as a collective effort to begin the process. And since we are shaping this new mode of transport in an existing world, it is obvious that there are compromises to be made and stakeholders to be convinced.

eVTOL.com: Do you intend to grow your partnerships within the initiative?

Markus May: This initiative is open and evolving. There will be new partnerships created as a result of new projects. We are in the process of defining new projects with new partners, but I cannot discuss it yet. With each individual project, we build one brick after another.

We are currently preparing new funding projects for this year.

eVTOL.com: How long have you had your sights set on Germany?

Markus May: There were several reasons behind what drove us toward southern Germany. There is an existing ecosystem of innovation for mobility in general. There are many startups that are in the region working on mobility, as well as established automotive and technology companies.

We also have an Airbus presence close by. Both divisions, Airbus Helicopters and Airbus Defense and Space, have testing and industrial sites in the area. We have a lot of support and resources with engineering experience in vertical lift. We can also discuss electrical flight and autonomy with the surrounding businesses. This technology is so new that if we were to set up somewhere else, we would not have this type of support and resources surrounding us as we do here in Munich.

eVTOL.com: Can you describe what the government landscape is like in Germany to help facilitate innovation and advancement of UAM in comparison to other regions, such as the U.S.?

Markus May: The Bavarian government had a strong willingness to make this happen. At the federal level, they wanted to see UAM in Germany. That is why they put together the budget and created a dedicated funding scheme to make this happen. We are very grateful for this financial support. The next step is now the creation of living lab environments to prototype, test and design the entire UAM ecosystem.

Comparing Germany with the U.S., companies in the U.S. seem to have strong support from the government and military. We probably have a little bit less in Germany and Europe in general.

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), two major regulators, are getting closer to aligning regulations. eVTOL aircraft certification will be aligned by both regulators, as it is today with helicopters and other classic aircraft. The alignment may take a few years but, in the meantime, we are making sure that we continue to follow high safety standards.

eVTOL.com: What are your thoughts about the FAA’s decision to change the way it certifies winged eVTOL aircraft? Does Airbus plan to have its EASA type certificate validated in the U.S. and other areas? If so, do you have any concerns about getting your type certification validated?

Markus May: We have been working very closely with EASA and will continue to work with them. Our goal is to certify with EASA first, then work with the FAA for approval. Everyone faces the same challenges when trying to certify their eVTOL aircraft. There are a lot of completely new designs being made, and the safety regulations will have to be designed as a comprehensive and reliable framework.

eVTOL.com: You’re working with a budget of €86-million (US$87-million) over a span of three years. What goals do you plan to accomplish over this period? When does Airbus plan to start UAM operations?

Markus May, head of operations for urban air mobility (UAM) at Airbus, said the Air Mobility Initiative in Germany received strong support from the local government, which put together the budget and created a dedicated funding scheme to facilitate the initiative. Airbus Image

Markus May: We will start UAM operations when we can ensure a transport solution and a mature ecosystem. In the meantime, we are building this solution step-by-step. We want to prototype how UAM operations will look in different environments, while regulations are still evolving. And hopefully we can launch this program by the middle of the decade.

We are working with Droniq to implement U-space to ensure integration of eVTOLs into the airspace. We also want to have the ground infrastructure set up and ready before we go into production.

As there is a new regulation taking into effect beginning in 2023, the objective is to set up the first U-space with Droniq in Bavaria. It is not a new airspace, but it will allow us to test the airspace to integrate eVTOLs with drones and helicopters so that we have different vehicles visible to each other in the same airspace. We would like to test this for a longer period as a laboratory environment.

Another important step is to work on operations, which includes ground infrastructure. We will build a vertiport prototype to see what processes we need on the ground. We want to efficiently integrate the processes with end-to-end logic. For instance, door-to-door travel time, which would be the amount of time it takes passengers to travel from their starting place to their ultimate desired destination.

eVTOL.com: Does the Air Mobility Initiative allow for other eVTOL OEMs to launch their vehicles through this program, or is the project exclusively for Airbus?

Markus May: Eventually, there will be different eVTOLs operating in the market. Until then, we are all pioneers of this aerospace revolution. Obviously, we’re focusing our attention on the CityAirbus NextGen from a vehicle perspective. But regarding other ecosystem elements, such as airspace, airport and city integration, we’re working with other players. We need this collaboration to establish joint standards for this emerging industry.

Apart from eVTOLs, we will be using other vehicles for flight testing. At our Airbus Drone Center, we are flying different types of drones, for instance. We will also fly an airship to get pictures and imagery of the city and environment to map out navigation for autonomous flight. We want to deliver a fully-electric vehicle that flies and we want to learn how it will operate in this sandbox environment. It will help us design for the future as operations and regulations are evolving.

eVTOL.com: What is the group’s strategy for addressing public perception?

Markus May: We have dedicated work packages that are focused on public acceptance. There are different studies from universities from a citizen or travel perspective and different frameworks. The City of Ingolstadt had set up a living lab downtown in the past, and there will be more to come in the next three years. UAM will be designed for citizens, by citizens. This is one of the most important elements in order to achieve societal acceptance for such an innovative mode of transport.

For instance, noise — if you cannot distinguish the eVTOL from the background noise anymore, it will be more acceptable. We can see positive feedback from the public, whether we look at the EASA study or at the learnings from trials in Ingolstadt. The concerns of citizens about noise are very important to help us define a better solution."
A380 superjumbo to test experimental open fan engine - CNN,"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWNmbS1hMzgwLXByb3B1bHNpb24tZGVtb25zdHJhdG9yL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAU5odHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi90cmF2ZWwvYXJ0aWNsZS9haXJidXMtY2ZtLWEzODAtcHJvcHVsc2lvbi1kZW1vbnN0cmF0b3I?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

Take a closer look at the plane on the top of this story. Notice anything different about one of its engines?

This Airbus A380, the world’s largest passenger jet, has been recruited as a demonstrator to trial new cutting-edge open fan engine architecture which could help cut carbon emissions by up to 20%.

The project was unveiled Tuesday by Airbus and CFM International at Farnborough Air Show just outside of London, an annual trade exhibition showcasing the latest in aerospace innovation.

It’s the latest innovation to be air-tested on the A380 “superjumbo,” which has had mixed fortunes in recent years. Production of the much-loved airplane was halted in 2021 due to lack of demand. Existing aircraft were grounded by airlines during the pandemic, only to enjoy a recent resurgence due to travel demand.

CFM, whose parent companies are GE and Safran Aircraft Engines, has been developing advanced propulsion technologies as part of its Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engine (RISE) demonstration program.

Now the aim is to mature and accelerate that with a flight test campaign on board this A380, which is due to take to the skies in the latter half of this decade from the Airbus Flight Test facility in Toulouse, France.

Before that happens,CFM will perform engine ground tests and flight test validation at GE Aviation’s Flight Test Operations center in Victorville, California.

The aims of the flight test program are to better understand engine/wing integration and aerodynamic performance, to demonstrate better fuel efficiency that would cut CO2 emissions by a fifth compared to today’s most efficient engines, and to ensure compatibility with 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF).

The aviation industry has made the ambitious pledge to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and this new technology could help support that.

“New propulsion technologies will play an important role in achieving aviation’s net-zero objectives, along with new aircraft designs and sustainable energy sources,” said Sabine Klauke, Airbus Chief Technical Officer, in a statement.

The CFM RISE Program is all about pushing the technology envelope, redefining the art of the possible, and helping to achieve more sustainable long-term growth for our industry,” Gaël Méheust, President and CEO of CFM International, confirmed.

Earlier this year, Airbus announced it was to test an experimental hydrogen engine on an A380 – another partnership with CFM International – with the aim of creating a zero-emission airplane by 2035."
SKYNET 6A satellite passes Critical Design Review - Airbus,"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLTA3LXNreW5ldC02YS1zYXRlbGxpdGUtcGFzc2VzLWNyaXRpY2FsLWRlc2lnbi1yZXZpZXfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus designed state-of-the-art secure military communications satellite on track

Manufacture ongoing with more than 400 working on the programme

Stevenage, 13 July 2022 - Airbus has achieved a key milestone with the successful completion of the Critical Design Review (CDR) of the UK Ministry of Defence’s (MOD) next secure military communications satellite, SKYNET 6A.

Richard Franklin, Managing Director of Airbus Defence and Space UK said: “Achieving this crucial milestone is tangible proof that in partnership with Defence Digital in the Ministry of Defence we are firmly on track and making great progress on this flagship programme. We now have more than 400 people working on the project at our key sites in Stevenage, Portsmouth and Hawthorn. We are building SKYNET 6A with its unique military communications payload entirely in the UK and we currently have more than 45 small to medium sized enterprises and subcontractors helping to make sure we remain on target for launch in 2025.”

Airbus was awarded the SKYNET 6A contract in July 2020 to supplement the existing SKYNET 5 fleet of four satellites and enhance the UK’s milsatcom capability. The SKYNET 6A CDR has been achieved on time, working closely with the Defence Digital team. The next major milestone will be the delivery of the Communications Structure by the end of 2022.

The SKYNET 6A contract covers the design, development, manufacture, assembly, integration, test and launch, of the military communications satellite, and includes key national technology development programmes.

The SKYNET 5 programme, provided by Airbus as a full service outsource contract, has provided the UK MOD with a suite of highly robust, reliable and secure military communications services, supporting global operations since 2003. Airbus has been involved in SKYNET since 1974 and remains firmly committed to supporting a strong space manufacturing capability in the UK.

The SKYNET 6A satellite is based on the Airbus Eurostar Neo telecommunications satellite platform. It utilizes the unique Airbus military communications payload, adopting the latest digital processing to provide more capacity and greater versatility than previous SKYNET satellites. SKYNET 6A will feature proven Airbus electric orbit raising propulsion as well as electric station keeping systems for maximum cost effectiveness. Complete satellite integration will take place at Airbus facilities in the UK followed by testing using RAL Space testing facilities at Harwell in Oxfordshire supporting the UK Space Agency initiative for UK national end-to-end satellite production and support.

Note to Editors:

SKYNET 6A is still on track for launch in 2025 on a Falcon 9 provided by SpaceX.

Airbus vs Boeing: who dominated the market during H1 2022? | Data - AeroTime,"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMzE3NDUtYWlyYnVzLWJvZWluZy1oMS1maW5hbmNpYWwtcmVzdWx0cy1kYXRh0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWVyb3RpbWUuYWVyby9hcnRpY2xlcy8zMTc0NS1haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLWgxLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1yZXN1bHRzLWRhdGEvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus and Boeing, two of the world’s largest plane makers, revealed their financial results for the first six months of 2022.

According to data from financial reports, Boeing accumulated slightly more revenue than Airbus during the first half of 2022.

Boeing’s revenues fell slightly to $30.7 billion in H1 2022 in contrast to $32.2 billion during the first half of 2021. Meanwhile, Airbus’ consolidated revenues grew narrowly during the first half of 2022, with $24.8 billion accumulated in contrast to $24.6 billion during the same period the previous year.

In terms of net income, Airbus clearly led the way during the first half of 2022. In H1 2022, Airbus reported a net income of $1.9 billion, whereas Boeing posted a net loss of $1 billion.

Boeing’s negative results were driven by “lower defense volume and unfavorable performance”, the report said. Additionally, Boeing is awaiting approval from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to restart Dreamliner deliveries after they were halted in 2021 over manufacturing issues.

Boeing said it still expects total one-off costs of approximately $2 billion due to issues with the 787, with most set to be incurred by the end of 2023. It acquired costs of $283 million for the 787 in the second quarter.

It is also worth noting that H1 2021 was a better period than H1 2022 for both manufacturers. Airbus reported a net profit of $2.2 billion, while Boeing reported $6 million.

In the financial report, Airbus said it had a “solid” H1 2022 financial performance but warned about “supply chain challenges” which led the manufacturer to adjust the A320 Family ramp-up steps and now targets a monthly rate of 65 in early 2024, around six months later than previously planned. Looking ahead, Airbus aims to deliver 700 aircraft in 2022."

Airbus Completes First ‘Wing Of Tomorrow’ Prototype - Aviation Week,"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9zaG93bmV3cy9mYXJuYm9yb3VnaC1haXJzaG93L2FpcmJ1cy1jb21wbGV0ZXMtZmlyc3Qtd2luZy10b21vcnJvdy1wcm90b3R5cGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FARNBOROUGH—Airbus has announced that its Wing of Tomorrow team has completed the first of three prototype demonstrators.

“Wing of Tomorrow is about preparing our technologies, preparing our people, preparing our supply chain, and also [making] our physical and digital capabilities ready for our future generation of Airbus aircraft,” says Sue Partridge, head of the program. “Today’s completion of our first wing assembly marks a key milestone along that journey.”

The program, launched in 2016, has been investigating the design, manufacture and industrialization aspects of novel wing concepts, as well as designing for increased performance and lower weight. The demonstrators incorporate over 100 different technologies, some of which may be applicable to extant programs, while others may only find applicability on aircraft yet to be designed.

“There’s three main objectives of the technologies we’re developing,” Partridge says. “The first is about aircraft performance. Alongside the engine, the wing is the biggest lever that we have to improve the performance of the aircraft, so the Wing of Tomorrow demonstrators are focused on looking at selecting a wing architecture that really, really gives us low drag, good lift, very, very good fuel efficiency, and long wings, which drive us towards needing to develop the folding wing tip technology.”

“There’s two other key objectives of the program overall, and they’re very much around our industrial targets [and] cost performance,” she continues. “How can you make a high-performance carbon wing—in order to make a weight reduction—at a low cost? And ... the technologies that we develop need to be capable of being manufactured at a high rate. We’re understanding through developing the technologies and integrating them together what might be the bottlenecks to prevent us from using those technologies on a high-production-rate aircraft.”

The first prototype wingbox was designed at Airbus’ site in Filton, England—which Partridge is head of—and has been assembled at the Advanced Manufacturing Research Center at the company’s plant in Broughton, Wales. Testing will take place at Filton.

The folding wing tip has not yet been fitted; this work will take place at Airbus’s site in Broughton. “In terms of the assembly of the wingbox itself, it doesn’t have a huge effect,” Partridge says. “Although you have the fittings in the wing, the actual installation of the folding wingtip would happen as a second step. It’s a key part of the program but not really a huge driver of the main wingbox assembly itself.”

Each of the three prototypes has a different purpose. And, while each is based on the same architecture and design, there are differences between them. “We have some differences in technologies, because we’re working with different partners, and some partners are delivering three components—one for each of the wings—and the others only one,” Partridge says. “There are some minor differences in the technology bricks in terms of the industrial system we’re gradually building. We have lots of automation technologies we’re deploying, but we’re doing that, some on the first one then building for the second and building for the third to make the progression manageable.”

“The purposes of the three boxes are different,” she adds. “The first one will become our fully equipped box, where we will test our installation technologies as well as our structural technologies; the second one will go down to Filton and be structurally tested at full scale; and the third one is called our ‘run at rate’ box, where we’ll have the full industrial system deployed, and we’ll really be testing the constraints of those industrial technologies and those automation packages to see what the art of the possible is.”"

Virgin Atlantic Unveils Airbus A330-900 Cabin (+Photos) - Airways Magazine,"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vdmlyZ2luLWF0bGFudGljLXVudmVpbHMtYTMzMC05MDAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON – Virgin Atlantic (VS) has showcased today to select media and VIPs, the interior of its forthcoming Airbus A330-900s.

Featured in the new airliners will be the latest generation of Virgin Atlantic’s business class, named ‘Upper Class,’ Bluetooth connectivity throughout all cabins, and two ‘Retreat Suites’ per aircraft, a new product offered by the airline.

The airline expects the first three A330-900s to be delivered in September, with the first revenue flight for the aircraft to operate to Boston in early October.

The airline originally ordered 14 of the aircraft at the 2019 Paris Air Show, with plans for the aircraft to eventually replace its A330-300s, which average 10.7 years old.

The new Airbuses are among Virgin’s ongoing initiatives to overhaul its fleet. In the last three years, the airline retired all of its Airbus A340-600s and Boeing 747-400s.

Commenting on the new A330-900s, Corneel Koster, Chief Customer and Operating Officer at Virgin Atlantic said that the new aircraft “play a significant role in our [Virgin’s] multi-billion dollar fleet transformation, demonstrating our commitment to the planet.”

“We know the most impactful thing we can do as an airline is to fly the cleanest, greenest, youngest fleet possible and the A330neo is integral to achieving this goal. It’s truly a plane for the future,” Koster added.

Upper Class Gets an Upgrade

Virgin Atlantic’s Upper Class product has gotten a significant upgrade, bringing the airline’s new aircraft up to par with its flagship, the Airbus A350-1000.

The new A330-900s will offer 30 Upper Class fully-private suites, featuring a passenger-controlled mood lighting, and a 17.3” touchscreen In-Flight Entertainment (IFE).

The most fascinating addition to the airline’s new Upper Class product is the new ‘Retreat Suites.’ The suites will be the most spacious ones within the fleet, complemented with a 27” touchscreen IFE, an ottoman that doubles as an extra seat, wireless charging pad, and a fully closing door to maximize privacy.

According to the airline, the ottoman will allow up to four people to comfortably dine or chat together, a nod to the Q-Suites product of Qatar Airways (QR), which allows passengers to combine suites to create a larger living space.

Alongside VS’s Upper Class is ‘The Loft’, a social space that has set the airline’s inflight experience apart from competing airlines.

The space will make an upgraded return in the A330-900s, with space for eight people, four seats, and a new self-service fridge and drinks dispenser.

A Look at Premium and Economy

In addition to the new innovations coming to the aircraft’s Upper Class, VS’s Premium and Economy experiences will also receive substantial upgrades.

The aircraft will feature 46 Premium seats with 38” of seat pitch, calf rests at each seat, and a 13.3” touchscreen. In a unique twist, the airline will also offer an in-seat wireless charging pad for each Premium seat.

Virgin Atlantic’s Competition

Between the new aircraft’s transatlantic prospects and the new Upper Class suites offered by VS, the focus applied by the airline’s newfound competition with JetBlue’s (B6) new Mint product is clear.

Last year, B6 launched its long-awaited transatlantic operations with flights between New York (JFK) and London (LGW, LHR). With the new expansion came an all-new ‘Mint’ business class product that strongly rivaled legacy airlines.

Now, VS is hitting back with top of class suites of its own in an attempt to stand out within the busy transatlantic market.

Another prospect of VS’s newfound competition will be its Joint Venture partner, Delta Air Lines (DL), which operates retrofitted Boeing 767-400s with new ‘Delta One’ Suites on some of its transatlantic routes.

Virgin Atlantic’s new aircraft are bound to shakeup a rapidly developing transatlantic market that demands the latest products from airlines to stay competitive.

In partnership with CNES and Airbus Defence and Space and as part of the TELEO project, Safran Data Systems has successfully delivered the first in a series of digital modems dedicated to Earth-to-Space optical communications, the Cortex Lasercom.





Laser optical communications will enable data rates 10 to 100 times higher than the radio frequency communications currently used. As the successor to the Cortex HDR, the world's leading satellite imagery reception modem, Safran Data Systems has developed the Cortex Lasercom modem with processing and decoding capabilities to achieve a record 10 Gigabytes per second bit rate for Earth-to-Space optical communications, a level unmatched anywhere in the world.





The Lasercom Cortex will be used in several cooperative projects between Safran, Airbus and CNES, and will equip future Optical Ground Stations (OGS) marketed by Safran. These OGS will allow communication with all future satellites that will carry laser communication capabilities with the Earth. Two demonstrations on Airbus and CNES programs will take place in 2023, a world first: LASIN on the CO3D constellation of imaging satellites, and TELEO on the future BADR-8 telecommunications satellite. On this occasion, the Lasercom Cortex will be equipped with error-correcting codes developed by Airbus Defence and Space, which allow it to deliver useful and error-free information to the user."

Boca Raton, FL, July 20 2022 -Satair, an Airbus Services company, and VAS Aero Services, a leader in aviation logistics and aftermarket services including end-of-life support, have signed an agreement under which Satair acquires VAS Aero Services, through its US subsidiary, Satair USA, Inc. VAS will continue as a separate enterprise, with operational sites and offices in Boca Raton (FL), Kent (WA) and London (UK), expanding Satair’s global footprint and aviation aftermarket service capabilities.

The acquisition complements Satair’s existing offerings through VAS’ expertise in managing engine and multi-fleet Used Serviceable Material (USM) products, which will play a key role in Satair’s strategic growth initiative in this segment.

“The customers’ demands are changing and we observe a clear prioritization of maximizing value through the complete aircraft lifecycle and beyond, focusing on cost-effectiveness and sustainability. With this acquisition, we are addressing the customers’ needs and securing Satair’s future footprint as a leading player in the material and USM business. Thereby, we are enhancing our capabilities to serve our customers and OEMs through the complete aircraft lifecycle. This acquisition is also a natural fit to Satair’s overall strategy and a complement to the Airbus sustainability agenda at large,” says Bart Reijnen, CEO of Satair.

Adi Bernstein, VAS Executive Chairman, said that “As owners and stewards of VAS for the past 10 years, David Alcalay and I viewed this joining with Satair and Airbus as a natural next step in the evolution of VAS Aero Services. The agreement follows years of Satair and VAS working together on servicing, warehousing as well as certification and distribution of USM products, including excess and surplus inventory.”

Satair’s existing offering has continuously grown over the years and recently Satair introduced its digital Marketplace, an e-commerce solution for material at competitive prices. VAS will tie into the parts channel of Satair, fostering new capabilities to this innovative and first-of-its-kind online Marketplace by offering an end-to-end transaction and fulfillment capability at significantly lower cost.

Tommy Hughes, CEO of VAS Aero Services, adds “VAS and Satair have worked closely for years; this acquisition further strengthens that bond, while giving our customers access to even more resources and USM products to prolong the useful life of their aviation assets. The Satair-VAS alliance offers a broader reach, a deeper service capability and cost efficiencies that will afford us a competitive advantage. Together, we are well-positioned to respond to changing market demands and lead with parts and service solutions that enable customer success.”"
Airbus‘ Scherer Expects Widebody Rates To Increase In Steps - Aviation Week,"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9zaG93bmV3cy9mYXJuYm9yb3VnaC1haXJzaG93L2FpcmJ1cy1zY2hlcmVyLWV4cGVjdHMtd2lkZWJvZHktcmF0ZXMtaW5jcmVhc2Utc3RlcHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FARNBOROUGH—Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer expects a steady increase in widebody rates over the next several years, as the manufacturer continues to see signs of returning demand for long-haul aircraft.

“We could be in a much more severe undersupply situation than in the single-aisle market,” Scherer tells ShowNews on the sidelines of the Farnborough Airshow. “We see increased demand for widebodies.”

Airbus is currently producing five A350s and two A330neos per month. The OEM has already confirmed its intention to raise A330neo production to three aircraft by the end of the year and A350 output to six aircraft in early 2023. At its peak, Airbus delivered 108 A330ceos in 2014, which was equivalent to an official rate of 10 aircraft per month. Output has declined over the years to just 16 aircraft—counting both A330ceos and A330neos—in 2021. Maximum A350 deliveries were reached in 2019 when Airbus put out 112 aircraft. It delivered 55 in 2021.

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury had said in a recent Aviation Week interview that Airbus could decide to grow widebody production sooner than many expect. Scherer did not commit to specific timing or rates. A doubling of production would take the manufacturer to a combined 15 widebody aircraft. In 2019, Airbus delivered 165 widebodies, so far the maximum number built.

Because any potential rate increases would likely come in small steps, Scherer expects delivery times for widebodies to increase significantly over time before supply catches up with demand.

As the industry gathers in Farnborough, it is facing severe macroeconomic headwinds such as inflation, rising interest rates, a strengthening dollar and very expensive fuel. Of those, Scherer believes inflation is the most troubling issue. “Inflation is a reality that we have to address in the eco-system,” he says. “It affects everyone in the supply chain and the risks are significant.”

By contrast, Airbus is not yet feeling headwinds from the rising interest rates. “There is still sufficient appetite in the financing market,” he adds.

Airbus did not announce an order on the first day of the show, though four Chinese airlines signed up for close to 300 aircraft in the run up to Farnborough. Airbus had been working on the commitment for years and the order came “very late” in the 14th plan. “It was a long, long process,” Scherer says. He believes China ultimately moved ahead because the airlines realized they were starting to lose production slots.

The manufacturer is struggling to increase narrowbody production to meet its target of 720 deliveries (combined with widebodies) for 2022. But Scherer says that he is “pleased with Airbus’ performance—I just wish I had more aircraft to sell.”

Scherer says that it was “a bit frustrating” that some of its suppliers “would not listen” when the company had put out its medium-term production targets last year. On the other hand, he concedes that “one has to understand [the pandemic] has been quite traumatic” for the supply chain. For the first time since the 2008 global financial crisis, the industry came to a “violent standstill.”"

Cargolux spurns Airbus to pick 777-8F as its workhorse of the future - theloadstar.com,"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbG9hZHN0YXIuY29tL2NhcmdvbHV4LXNwdXJucy1haXJidXMtdG8tcGljay03NzctOGYtYXMtaXRzLXdvcmtob3JzZS1vZi10aGUtZnV0dXJlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Alex Lennane 21/07/2022

Cargolux is staying tight-lipped over its potential fleet orders, after disclosing at the Farnborough Air Show that it has picked its workhorse for the future: the 777-8F.

Airbus will no doubt be hugely disappointed after its big efforts in trying to lure Cargolux with its A350 freighter, but Richard Forson, Cargolux chief executive, was careful not to upset the European manufacturer and declined to be drawn specifically on why he’d bet on Boeing.

In a response to The Loadstar, he said simply that the 777-8F was the “preferred solution … taking all relevant factors into account for a long-haul widebody freighter which meets the requirement of Cargolux for the future”.

He did note that both aircraft types had met Cargolux’s CO2 sustainability requirements – but added “we also factor other emissions into account besides only CO2”.

The carrier is also keeping its order plans close to its chest, just noting that “the contract documentation is in place”.

The first retirements from its current 747F fleet are due to begin in 2026, although Mr Forson said the carrier had “the ability to extend if required”. New-generation 777Fs are unlikely to be delivered before 2027 – although Airbus had made some noises to the carrier about available A350Fs by 2025.

Cargolux is unlikely to opt for a bumper order of aircraft. Mr Forson told The Loadstar in May he was fearful of overcapacity.

“Growing the fleet may be part of the decision, but it’s easy to grow when there is a lack of capacity. But when the decline comes, for economic or other reasons, there will be a huge amount of surplus capacity, and that will have a significant impact on the business environment. It has happened before.

“The importance of cargo has resurged again, so there has been investment in capacity. But I don’t believe there will be a lack of capacity in the medium or long term,” Mr Forson added, citing inflation, interest rates and potential lack of consumer demand.

“I want to be the size of airline that always remains relevant to forwarders, so Cargolux will always be in the top tier.”

As a long-term customer of Boeing, Cargolux is likely to have preferred not to change lanes, and introducing a new Boeing aircraft rather than a completely new type may have had an influence on the decision-making, as hinted by Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal.

“With the selection of our newest freighter as its preferred solution, Cargolux continues its long and enduring history with Boeing, integrating the 777-8F seamlessly into the airline’s all-747 cargo operations.”"

The rosier analysis explains why Boeing (NYSE: BA) projects a need for 540 more dedicated cargo jets than Airbus over the next 20 years.

The world’s dominant jet manufacturers issued their visions of how the passenger and air cargo markets are likely to look 20 years from now on the eve of the prestigious Farnborough International Airshow in England, where they are expected to announce more aircraft deals.

On Monday, All Nippon Airways finalized a recent expression of interest for two all-new 7777-8 freighters, and Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) officially signed to buy 100 737-10 MAX single-aisle passenger jets. Also, Aircompany Armenia and partner company Georgian Airlines announced an order for three 737-800 Boeing Converted Freighters as part of the group’s plan to add more dedicated cargo airplanes to its operations in the Caucasus region.

Boeing projects air cargo volumes will achieve 4.1% compound annual growth over the next two decades, an uptick of one-tenth of a point from last year’s report, based on expected growth in GDP, industrial production, global trade and e-commerce. The 10-year outlook envisions 4.3% growth.

More conservative Airbus (DXE: AIR) said freight traffic will grow at an annual rate of 3.2% through 2041, with the express sector outpacing general cargo at 4.9% versus 2.7% growth. The Airbus estimate is higher than last year, when it pegged express cargo growth at 4.7%. The express share of global cargo volume is expected to increase to 25% from 17% in 2019, it added.

The U.S. aerospace giant, working its way back from the fallout of the pandemic, the 737 MAX grounding and production snafus with the 787 Dreamliner, predicted that sustaining that traffic will require nearly 2,800 additional freighters, including 940 new widebody models, to be delivered through 2041 — half to replace older, less fuel-efficient aircraft and half to support greater shipping demand. Two-thirds (1,855) of the additional cargo jets will be used passenger aircraft converted for a new mission, and 70% of those will be standard-body aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320/321 families.

Boeing’s commercial market outlook counted 2,250 jet freighters around the world at the end of last year, up from 2,010 before the pandemic as operators delayed retirements and pulled older planes out of deep storage to support the boom in cargo demand after airlines halted most passenger flying.





The company’s 2041 forecast for the fleet to reach 3,610 units with a 3% average annual growth rate represents a nearly 7% increase over last year, reflecting expectations for higher traffic growth and replacement needs. Estimates for factory-built and converted freighters are higher than in the 2021 outlook.

In the narrowbody segment, the global fleet is projected to nearly double (plus 90%) from 2021, with widebody growth of 75%. Boeing said half of its current 660 large freighters are nearing retirement age and that the industry will require 515 units for replacement and growth needs. Last year it estimated a need for 450 new large widebody freighters.

Airbus’ lower estimate for air cargo demand influenced its projection for freighter needs. The European airframer said the industry will need 2,440 cargo jet deliveries, with nearly 900 of those from new production and the remainder modified passenger aircraft. It puts the total freighter fleet at 3,070 units in 2041, with 1,400 representing replacement aircraft, 1,040 coming from growth and 630 current units remaining in operation. The freighter estimate over 20 years increased from 2,980 aircraft in the 2021 outlook.

Both market outlooks assume world trade will double in 20 years, based on an annual growth of about 2.85%. That growth rate is slower than the 4.8% experienced for the 20 years before the pandemic.

Air cargo gains momentum

Several forces besides macroeconomic trends are driving increased air cargo utilization and interest in all-cargo aircraft.

Airlines have generated record cargo revenues and enjoyed yields double those in 2019 as a result of tight capacity and changes in consumption patterns as economic lockdowns threw economies out of sync. Air cargo volumes in 2021 increased nearly 7% over the pre-pandemic level. Extensive disruptions in ocean shipping have made schedule reliability nearly nonexistent and stratospheric rate increases for containers have significantly narrowed the gap in pricing. Three years ago, shipping by air was 10 to 15 times more expensive than ocean transport. Today, average air rates are only five times more than ocean. The changing market conditions led many businesses to convert a portion of their shipments to air.

Goods movement is still constrained by the lagging recovery of long-haul passenger travel, which is only about 65% back to 2019 levels and typically happens on widebody aircraft that can also accommodate large amounts of cargo. Prior to the pandemic, about 50% of global cargo traffic moved in passenger bellies. Today, main-deck freighters haul two-thirds of global air cargo.

The pandemic put a premium on speed and reliability, airfreight’s core strengths. It also forced many companies to reevaluate their supply chains and how to reduce risk associated with labor and supplier problems, weather events or geopolitical events. Boeing said the trend toward resiliency could benefit air cargo as manufacturers and logistics providers consider ways to diversify supply chains. The supply chains with more nodes in the system can benefit from the flexibility of air cargo and point-to-point service, Boeing said.





The largest change in favor of long-term air cargo growth is e-commerce, which has doubled its share of retail sales over the past five years and heavily relies on express delivery networks with same-day and overnight air capabilities to meet demanding customer expectations for rapid delivery.

Boeing is building 767 medium-widebody freighters and larger 777 freighters through 2027, with the next-generation 777-8 taking over after that. Boeing has yet to develop a replacement for the 767 freighter, which was made obsolete by pending international emissions rules. It also has a large program for converting used 737-800s for freight.

Airbus has lagged behind Boeing in freighters but is making a big push with its new A350 large freighter, as well as a new conversion program fcr the A320/321 and a revitalized passenger-to-freighter program for the A330.

Passenger market

Overall, Boeing forecasts demand for more than 41,000 new airplanes through 2041, representing a market value of $7.2 trillion. Airlines will grow the combined passenger/freighter fleet at a 2.8% compound annual growth rate, bringing the total inventory to 47,080 units from 25,900 in 2019. The current fleet forecast is 7.6% smaller because of pandemic-induced structural industry changes, such as downsizing and a move toward larger single-aisle jets, and the exclusion of potential sales in Russia and Central Asia due to sanctions over the war in Ukraine.

Widebody aircraft will continue to represent about 18% of the total aircraft population, but the estimate for 7,230 units is down 11% from 2019. Small and medium widebodies, such as the 787, have gained share over the largest planes, like the A380 and 747, because airplane range is less dependent on size these days.

Airbus, again, arrived at a lower figure for the total airfleet. It forecasts demand for 39,490 new passenger and freighter aircraft over the next 20 years with a total in-service fleet of 46,930.

The new venture, HAPS Services Business, is a subsidiary of Airbus Defence and Space.

HAPS — high altitude platform stations — operate in the stratosphere, much closer to Earth than satellites, and can provide connectivity. Zephyr is an unmanned aerial system (UAS). The Zephyr was originally developed in the early 2000s by QinetiQ, and then sold to EADS Astrium, now Airbus Defence and Space.

The current Airbus Zephyr has a wingspan of 25 meters, weighs less than 75 kilograms, and is solar powered. In 2018, the system flew a record 25 days, 23 hours and 57 minutes without refueling. The BBC recently reported that flight tracking data suggests a Zephyr recently broke the 2018 record, spending 26 days airborne, but Airbus would not comment on the test.

Airbus sees potential for HAPS to bridge the digital divide, and claims that one Zephyr has the coverage equivalent to that of 250 cell towers and can enable direct-to-device connectivity. In 2021, Airbus and NTT DOCOMO performed a test in the U.S. in which Zephyr provided a datalink during flight to simulate future direct-to-device connectivity. Tests included various bandwidths to simulate direct-to-device service from the HAPS to end users using low, nominal and high throughput.

Airbus pitches Zephyr as complementary to existing solutions. “Filling the gap between ground towers, conventional aircraft and satellites, Zephyr is positioned perfectly to complement and enhance existing infrastructure,” the company said in a description of Zephyr.

Zephyr is not just for connectivity and it can also be equipped with sensors and used for sensing purposes like border protection and environmental monitoring for crops and wildfires. It has a wide visual payload coverage of 20 by 30 km footprint.

“Our connectivity services will provide a viable alternative and complement to terrestrial and satellite-based connectivity solutions, allowing for the first time low-latency and direct-to-device connectivity across vast geographies, and economically. Our sustainable technology allows us to save and improve people’s lives whilst ensuring a better outcome for our planet,” Halawi said.

Halawi was previously CCO of Intelsat and left the company about two months before it emerged from a long Chapter 11 bankruptcy process. He has more than 20 years of experience in the satellite industry and was previous CEO of Thuraya Telecommunications.

He is joined by CFO Taz Esmail, who was most recently CFO of Meta Aerospace. She has extensive experience in the aviation, aerospace and defense sectors.

Intelsat and Airbus both joined industry group the HAPS Alliance, formed in 2020 to promote HAPS, develop common product specifications, and promote the standardization of HAPS network interoperability.

Earlier this year, Airbus began a study with NTT, DOCOMO, and SKY Perfect JSAT to examine the feasibility of HAPS-based connectivity services in a future space-based wireless connectivity ecosystem.

Airbus is not the first to try to commercialize HAPS. Google parent company Alphabet previously invested in HAPS technology through subsidiary Loon, but shuttered the business in 2021. The venture flew a Loon balloon for 321 days from May 2019 to March 2020 and developed a number of partnerships with the satellite industry, including a Telesat, but ultimately failed to develop a business model.

“Loon has been chasing the hardest problem of all in connectivity — the last billion users: The communities in areas too difficult or remote to reach,” Loon CEO Alastair Westgarth wrote in 2021. “While we’ve found a number of willing partners along the way, we haven’t found a way to get the costs low enough to build a long-term, sustainable business.”"

Airbus announced at the Farnborough Air Show on July 19 its A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport is now the first tanker to be certified to conduct automatic air-to-air refueling, or A3R, boom operations in daylight. Airbus said the certification by the Spanish National Institute for Aerospace Technology came after a collaboration with the Republic of Singapore Air Force.

The Lockheed Martin LMXT aerial refueling tanker, which the company hopes can compete for the KC-Y bridge tanker, is a modified Airbus A330 MRTT adapted to the U.S. Air Force’s needs.

Later that same day, Boeing issued a statement to reporters saying its KC-46A Pegasus — the Air Force’s newest refueling tanker, of which at least 61 of a planned 179 have been delivered — has carried out autonomous boom aerial refueling capability during flight tests.

Boeing said Tuesday it continues “to mature the technology, concept of operations, and the pathway to robust certification with the FAA and relevant regulators.”

“As we do so, we will continue to work with our customers to determine whether, when and how to integrate the autonomous capability to best support their mission,” the company added, but declined to share more information on its autonomous refueling tests.

The Air Force is now in the process of buying more KC-46s, and is planning for a next-generation tanker dubbed the KC-Z. But it will need more tankers to bridge the gap between now and when the KC-Z becomes a reality.

In recent months the Air Force has suggested it may forgo a competition for KC-Y, and go straight to buying more KC-46s.

In a March budget briefing, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall told reporters as the service considered what it needed out of a bridge tanker, the requirements “started to look like a modified KC-46, more than they do a completely new design.”

“I think that there’s still a possibility of a competition out there,” Kendall said in March. “But as we’ve looked at our requirements, the likelihood of a competition has come down.”

Erin Moseley, Lockheed Martin’s vice president for strategy and business development for aeronautics, told Defense News in an interview that Lockheed wants to compete for the bridge tanker and sees its LMXT as complementary to the KC-46.

“We definitely would like to demonstrate the fact that this complementary capability is important from an industrial base standpoint,” Moseley said. “It’s also important to be able to have multiple options for the Air Force and for other customers.”

Kendall and Andrew Hunter, the service’s acquisition chief, have assured Lockheed the service will go through the requirements process for determining which way to go on a KC-Y competition, Moseley said.

Hunter told reporters on July 16 at the Royal International Air Tattoo in England a plan should be ready as the Air Force moves into the 2024 budget cycle.

Airbus said in Tuesday’s release its automatic air-to-air refueling capability would reduce the workload of air refueling operators, improve safety and produce more efficient refueling transfers. Airbus said the process would not require additional equipment on the aircraft that is being refueled.

Airbus also said it has launched a demonstrator called Auto’Mate it hopes will help produce technologies that move it toward autonomous refueling and formation flights. This will also include automating steps in the process carried out by the receiving aircraft.

Airbus hopes to test those new technologies in flight next year, and predicted a final end-to-end demonstration in mid-2024. These test flights would use an A310 as the refueling tanker and DT-25 target drones as the receiving aircraft.

Airbus said these autonomous aerial refueling technologies will reduce crew fatigue and training costs, while improving safety and efficiency. They could even lead to drones refueling other drones, Airbus said, potentially crucial in future wars.

Airbus A320 Family Performance in H122

In spite of a challenging operating environment and additional industry concerns brought on by the geopolitical and economic climate, Airbus produced a strong H1 2022 financial performance.

However, according to Guillaume Faury, CEO of Airbus, the company is changing the A320 Family ramp-up phases in 2022 and 2023 because of the supply chain issues, now aiming for a monthly rate of 65 in early 2024.

Airbus’ 2022 aircraft delivery goal has been revised in line with this. With high customer demand, the CEO stated that Airbus teams were engaged with suppliers and partners to ramp up towards an A320 Family monthly production rate of 75 in 2025.

Virgin Atlantic Just Unveiled Its Airbus A330neo — With the Most Spacious Suite in the Airline's History - Travel + Leisure,"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFuZGxlaXN1cmUuY29tL2FpcmxpbmVzLWFpcnBvcnRzL3Zpcmdpbi1hdGxhbnRpYy1uZXctYWlyYnVzLWEzMzBuZW_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In 2019, Virgin Atlantic placed an order for 16 brand-new Airbus A330-900neo aircraft. And while the subsequent two years were a difficult time for travel, the industry is finally rebounding — just in time for the U.K.-based airline to receive the first three aircraft in the order.

The highly efficient A330neo will eventually replace Virgin Atlantic's older A330-900 aircraft, reducing fuel burn and carbon emissions by 11% from the older model — something that aligns closely with Virgin Atlantic's mission to fly ""the cleanest, greenest fleet in the sky,"" according to a press release.

For this aircraft, which has slimmer proportions than other wide-body planes like the Airbus A350, Virgin Atlantic had to design a new business-class product — a collaborative project between the company's in-house design team and London creative agency Factorydesign. They riffed on Virgin Atlantic's existing Upper Class (the airline's term for business-class) suites, which are currently found on its A350 aircraft. But on the A330neo, the 30 Upper Class suites will have fully closing doors instead of partially closing ones, and each of the seats will be forward-facing rather than a mix of backward and forward. And they've been kitted out with the latest tech, including bluetooth connectivity to the in-flight entertainment system and wireless charging ports.

Virgin Atlantic is known for having social spaces onboard each of its aircraft, and that trend will continue with the A330neo. Called the Loft, the space is a small onboard lounge for the exclusive use of Upper Class passengers that has communal seating for up to eight and a self-service refrigerator and freezer with treats like alcoholic beverages and ice cream. It even has wireless charging ports, just like the Upper Class suites.

But the star of the show is an even more premium seat that's making its debut on the A330neo: the Retreat Suites. An upgrade over the traditional Upper Class suite, these suites provide even more space for passengers, with a six-foot, seven-inch lie-flat bed. And they have some of the biggest screens in the business, at a massive 27 inches. But the most innovative feature of the Retreat Suites is the fact that the ottomans for each seat can be set up as sitting space for guests — a fold-out table in between the main seat and the ottoman means that guests can dine together or just have a private social space in which to hang out.

The first A330neo aircraft will have two Retreat Suites onboard in the Upper Class cabin, located in front of the cabin in the middle of the two aisles. The seats can be combined into a two-person suite, or a divider can keep them separate for solo travelers. They will be available for Upper Class passengers to upgrade to starting 14 days before the flight at the relatively low price point of £200 (about $240).

Behind Upper Class, the A330neo will have 45 Premium seats, the airline's premium-economy product, which offer extra recline and leg room, leg rests, and wireless charging ports. And in economy, the 184 seats will be a 2-4-2 layout, which reduces the number of middle seats in the cabin compared to many other wide-body aircraft, which often feature 3-3-3 layouts. Economy will be split into two types of seats: Economy and Economy Delight, which has three extra inches of leg room compared to the standard economy seat.

""The A330neo plays a significant role in our multi-billion dollar fleet transformation, demonstrating our commitment to the planet,"" Corneel Koster, chief customer and operating officer at Virgin Atlantic, said in a statement. ""We know the most impactful thing we can do as an airline is to fly the cleanest, greenest, youngest fleet possible and the A330neo is integral to achieving this goal, reducing the average age of our fleet to just seven years by 2026. It's truly a plane for the future.""

Virgin Atlantic's A330neo will make its debut on the airline's Boston to London route in October 2022; tickets will go on sale this month."

The order is for two confirmed aircraft with the first H175 set to be delivered to LCI in late 2023. The agreement provides for a further four options, and builds on LCI’s previous order for new H175s.



Jaspal Jandu, CEO of LCI, says: “The Airbus H175 is a versatile, multi-purpose helicopter and this order will help to maintain the breadth of LCI’s product offering. This latest chapter in our partnership is an important element of our long-term growth strategy, and demonstrates our confidence in the helicopter leasing market.”



Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters, says: “LCI is a longstanding and valued Airbus partner. As a leading lessor and operator of Airbus helicopters, their renewed commitment to the H175 demonstrates the strength of the marketplace and its post-pandemic recovery.



LCI’s fleet currently includes around 50 Airbus helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. They are deployed by 14 operators in 10 countries across the globe on a range of missions including emergency medical services, search and rescue and offshore wind.



The H175 first entered service in 2015 and combines long range capabilities with smooth flight qualities, excellent payload and cabin comfort. It is a highly versatile, super-medium aircraft that can operate in a range of different configurations.



LCI has consistently grown in scale and value as it has diversified over time. The lessor’s highly experienced management team has built strong relationships with aircraft and engine manufacturers, customers, and leading financial institutions.



Since its inception in 2004, LCI has undertaken in excess of US$8 billion of transactions in the aviation markets.

737 Max Orders Help Boeing Crush Airbus at Farnborough Airshow - FLYING,"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZseWluZ21hZy5jb20vNzM3LW1heC1vcmRlcnMtaGVscC1ib2VpbmctY3J1c2gtYWlyYnVzLWF0LWZhcm5ib3JvdWdoLWFpcnNob3cv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing’s 737 Max led airliner orders this week at England’s 2022 Farnborough International Airshow, representing a comeback of the beleaguered single-aisle jet.

Three years after Max airplanes were grounded in the wake of two deadly accidents, multiple Max variants garnered the lion’s share of Boeing’s 176 orders, eclipsing total orders for airliners manufactured by rival Airbus.

This year’s event marked the first time airliner manufacturers and customers have gathered at Farnborough since the COVID-19 pandemic cratered air travel in 2020, hobbling the airline industry.

As air travel ramps up this summer, Boeing’s largest order came from Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines, which ordered 100 737 Max 10s—now rebranded as 737-10s. Delta’s first new Boeing order since 2011 had been preceded by large Delta orders for Airbus A321 and its fuel-efficient A321neo variant.

“The aircraft will complement Delta’s high-performance A321neo fleet,” Delta said in a statement. The order will bring the carrier’s total 737 fleet to more than 300 aircraft, Delta’s second-largest fleet family behind Airbus’ A320.

Delta acknowledged the 737-10 variant is still awaiting final certification from the FAA—expected in 2023. “In the event of a delay, the agreement has adequate protection in place, including allowing Delta to shift to another model of [the] Max family if necessary,” Delta said.

Other Significant Orders

Airbus benefited from Delta’s spending spree as well, firming up 12 options for Airbus A220-300s, the larger version of the single-aisle airliner.

The total number of Airbus orders at Farnborough this year was smaller than Boeing’s, but included 56 orders from EasyJet for A320neos, including 18 previously ordered A320neos converted to orders for larger A321neos.

In fact the ultra-efficient A321neo received 17 orders from LATAM.

Nonetheless, Airbus orders at Farnborough totaled only 85 aircraft—a lower number than analysts expected. “If they really have some unfinished deals in the making, it remains to be seen,” Richard Schuurman of industry consultant AirInsight told FLYING. This week yielded the lowest number of Airbus orders at a major European airshow since the Paris Air Show in 2017, Schuurman said, “although they have already sold over 500 aircraft this year.”

Airbus Leaves Early

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury and chief commercial officer Christian Scherer skipped the company’s traditional week-ender news conference to announce final order tallies. Instead, they left the airshow on Wednesday, a day earlier than expected, the Seattle Times reported.

Times reporter Dominic Gates reported Scherer told him, “Don’t worry about our sales ability. We’re doing really well, thank you very much.”

As day three at Farnborough ends, both Airbus CEO Faury and sales chief Scherer have left the Air Show.

Embraer

Brazil-based Embraer reported orders for eight E175 airliners for Horizon Air and two E190 converted freighters for Nordic Aviation Capital.

Embraer also reported receiving letters of intent (LOIs) to purchase more than 250 of Embraer’s new 70- and 90-seat turboprops. The next-gen airliner is expected to be launched next year in Paris, Schuurman said. “It would almost double their order backlog and drastically improve their business case.”"

As described by the airline, the A350 flagship aircraft is the ‘Ambassador of ITA Airways in the world’, and its bold blue livery certainly helps the airline stand out.

Following the struggles and eventual demise of Alitalia in late 2020, AZ was born, quickly establishing its brand and reorganizing itself.

Soon, in August of 2021, the airline launched its website and ticket sales, officially continuing the legacy of Alitalia.

The airline’s announcements, however, were made as the Italian government reviews offers by Lufthansa (LH), the MSC Group, and the Air France-KLM Group to become majority stakeholders.

Sustainability Takes the Spotlight

At the Farnborough Airshow, AZ presented its Sustainability Manifesto, which describes the airline’s efforts to offset emissions, utilize a ‘green value chain’, and promote diversity and inclusion.

Sustainability has become a focal issue for the aviation industry and provides airlines with the opportunity to not only help the planet but also reduce costs and create new products that incorporate new, exciting technologies.

A large part of the airline’s sustainability initiatives stems from its plan to overhaul its inherited fleet of Alitalia aircraft, exchanging them for next-generation Airbus aircraft. The new aircraft order, which was firmed on December 1, 2021, includes seven A220s, 11 A320neos, and 10 A330neos.

In addition, the airline signed with Air Lease Corporation to lease 31 next-generation Airbus aircraft, including the A350. The airline plans to ensure that 75% of its fleet is next-generation by 2025, an impressive goal.

ITA’s Sleek A350

In June of this year, AZ began operating its fleet of Airbus A350-900 aircraft, becoming the first Italian and 40th airline globally to do so.

With five in operation and a further, sixth aircraft to soon join the airline’s fleet, the flagship product features the latest hard products available in the industry.

The new aircraft features 334 seats, including 33 lie-flat business class seats, 39 seats in ‘Comfort Economy’, and 262 in economy.

“Comfort, elegance, simplicity, materials and colours” were the building blocks for the airline in its customization of the aircraft’s interior.

The carefully chosen tones and hues of the cabin create a harmonious, elegant atmosphere that reflects the airline’s brand.

In addition to new seating, the aircraft utilizes special cabin lighting that changes seamlessly based on different situations on board.

For its business class seats, AZ chose Collins Super Diamond seats, which have become increasingly popular within the aviation industry.

A Look at ITA’s New Uniforms

As part of the airline’s overhaul, AZ created new uniforms for its crew, with consultancy from Italian designer Brunello Cucinelli.

The project fused both sustainability objectives and its ‘Made in Italy’ initiative. The uniforms are produced by medium-sized Italian companies, as part of the airline’s work to focus on the national system.

The new uniforms include a dry-fitting jacket and trouser suit with a one-and-a-half breasted jacket for men, and a jacket and trousers or skirt combination for women.

Over the next few months, the uniforms will make their way through the fleet, and will be implemented progressively to “avoid wasting money.”

"Saudi King Salman, His Sons and Airbus - Fair Observer","Fri, 15 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhaXJvYnNlcnZlci5jb20vcG9saXRpY3Mvc2F1ZGkta2luZy1zYWxtYW4taGlzLXNvbnMtYW5kLWFpcmJ1cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Last month, a London court heard how a senior executive and associate of an Airbus subsidiary paid over $11.5 million (£9.7 million) in bribes to Saudi Arabian military officials to secure lucrative contracts for the UK government.

The case, which was first exposed by Private Eye in 2016, relates to a UK government deal to provide communications services to the Saudi Arabian National Guard (SANG), which were delivered by a now defunct unit of Airbus called GPT Special Project Management. The Serious Fraud Office has prosecuted the case. It claims GPT paid other companies, which were then used to bribe senior Saudi officials, including Prince Miteb bin Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, former head of SANG, in order to secure the contracts.

Opening the defense case at Southwark Crown Court, Barrister Ian Winter QC described the structure of the government-to-government deal, which dates back to the late 1970s, as a “fiddle” that enabled members of the Saudi royal family and the British government to “deny having any knowledge of [the payments] at all”. Winter went on to say: “This indictment does not begin to plumb the depths of what the UK government has been involved in since the late 1970s.” The case promises not only to cast new light on the depths of UK-Saudi relations, but also to overshadow a much more recent Saudi deal with Airbus struck by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) for the exclusive benefit of himself and his line of the family.

MBS’s Murky Business Empire

Little public information is available about how the Salman clan runs its business empire. MBS is believed to oversee it personally and his full brother Turki and mother Fahda bint Falah bin Sultan al-Hithlayn are also involved. Fahda, who is never seen in public, was restored to Saudi society without comment in 2018 after being locked up by MBS for two years. Turki’s main role is to introduce Western companies to the crown prince and he deliberately keeps in the background.

Outside Saudi Arabia, the family controls three Luxembourg-registered companies—Safason Corporation, Valburton Investments S.A. and Folabin—about which very little public information is available. Inside Saudi Arabia, their principal business vehicle is Tharawat Holding Company of which Turki bin Salman is the chairman.

Tharawat Holding Company has business interests inside Saudi Arabia in diverse sectors including construction, real estate, health, education, sports development, food and beverage, aquaculture, telecommunications and natural resources management. It is also suspected of having made a fortune out of defense contracts linked to the Yemen war. Before he was kidnapped and returned to Saudi Arabia against his will, a dissident Saudi prince told Arab Digest that, when the war started, Tharawat diversified its foreign partnerships into military materiel and the Salman clan enriched itself immensely via inflated arms contracts arranged by Turki.

“[Salman’s branch] are behind things inside the country and the Saudi public knows about it” said the prince. “MBS operates his business by bringing his special people and he is in control of the Royal Court. The younger brothers are making money, especially Prince Turki bin Salman. He has no official position—just a businessman —but MBS gives his brother some deals. Turki works for them.”

In September 2015, an anonymous grandson of Ibn Saud published a letter calling for the downfall of the Saudi king in which he warned that large sums of money are being embezzled by the inner circle of the royal family. The letter stated that $160 billion (SAR 600 billion) was taken by the leadership with a further $100 billion (SAR 375 billion) allegedly going directly to MBS and his brothers, Turki, Khaled, Nayif, Bandar, and Rakan.

Power and Wealth to MBS, His Sons and Brothers

The dissident prince also said Turki told him that MBS intends to change the current system of succession in the Saudi Kingdom to one based on primogeniture so that MBS’s own son will inherit the throne after him. “Turki told me we will be like Bahrain and Jordan where MBS will be king and then his son will be his successor’” said the prince.

“When MBS becomes king, he wants to put one of his children as crown prince, he wants it in his family, Salman’s family, so he will appoint his son as crown prince although he is only a little baby. He has one son called Salman. MBS wants to put him on the crown in the same way as the monarchies of Morocco, Bahrain, Jordan, or England do, to keep the throne for his blood. Either MBS will put his son directly as crown prince or he will first appoint one of his brothers and then his son.”

One business deal the Salman clan are known to have been involved in is arranging the financing for a new fleet of Airbus planes for Saudi Arabian Airlines, the flagship carrier of Saudi Arabia. In 2018 The Wall Street Journal published an investigation into how the clan uses businesses connected to the government to make their fortunes. The story explains in detail how, when MBS came to power, he helped re-engineer the original plan.

As per the original plan, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) would have purchased 50 new planes directly from Airbus for Saudi Arabian Airlines. MBS has dumped that deal for a far more complex deal involving a newly established company called International Airfinance Corp (IAFC), which manages an Islamic finance fund called ALIF and is part-owned by an Islamic bank based in the Dubai International Financial Centre called Quantum Investment Bank in which Tharawat acquired a 54% stake. MBS’s brother Turki is the chairman of this bank.

Despite concerns raised about the deal—Saudi Arabian Airlines did not solicit bids from any other companies—and the fact that the Serious Fraud Office in London was at that time already investigating an Airbus subsidiary for corruption involving the Saudis, Airbus agreed to invest $100 million in ALIF on the condition that the fund would buy only Airbus planes. On June 23, 2014, Airbus and IAFC held a “signing ceremony” in London to announce the new fund. The IAFC press release tells us Turki hosted this ceremony.

In 2015, after King Abdullah died, the plan changed yet again into an even more convoluted chain of transactions. Instead of being sold directly to the Saudi government, the jets would now be sold to ALIF, which would in turn rent them to the state-owned Saudi Arabian Airlines, which has subsequently been rebranded as Saudia. Note that this convoluted deal helps Tharawat ending up as a beneficiary. As one government official put it, “at the end it went to Tharawat, who got others to finance it, and made huge profits without risking any of their money.”

On August 5, 2015, the anonymous opposition Saudi Twitter account Mujtahidd tweeted that the list price for 30 A320 and 20 A330-300 Airbus planes was $8 billion (SAR30 billion), but the amount budgeted was $12 billion (SAR 45 billion). The budgeted price is 50% more than the listed price, meaning $4 billion could be going into the pockets of MBS, Turki and their brothers. The original tweet is no longer available as Mujtahidd was hacked a month later and all its tweets were erased. Mujtahidd also wrote that MBS financed the deal with a Saudi government guarantee, on condition that Saudi Arabian Airlines paid Tharawat 150% of the agreed price.

The deal was finalized by MBS during a 2015 visit to France and not long after, at a gathering in a Saudi palace, he took credit for it. MBS claimed that the transaction demonstrated his success in balancing the Saudi state’s financial interests with his family’s interests. MBS reportedly said, “I am the mastermind behind this deal.” Depending on what happens next with the Serious Fraud Office’s case now unfolding in Southwark Crown Court, MBS’s cherished deal could yet come unstuck.

"Up, up and away: Airbus' Zephyr drone breaks flight record high above Arizona - C4ISRNET","Fri, 22 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmM0aXNybmV0LmNvbS91bm1hbm5lZC8yMDIyLzA3LzIyL3VwLXVwLWFuZC1hd2F5LWFpcmJ1cy16ZXBoeXItZHJvbmUtYnJlYWtzLWZsaWdodC1yZWNvcmQtaGlnaC1hYm92ZS1hcml6b25hL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON – The solar-powered Zephyr drone beat its own record for time spent aloft as an uncrewed aircraft system, with 36 days completed so far, and counting, according to Army Futures Command.

AFC’s Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing/Space Cross-Functional Team launched the aircraft on June 15 and it remains deployed some 70,000 feet over Arizona. The pilotless aircraft previously set the longevity record at about 26 days in 2018.

The first stratospheric UAS of its kind, Zephyr can fly continuously for months at a time, far above weather and conventional air traffic. It has a wingspan of just over 82 feet — longer than 2 school buses placed end-to-end, but weighs less than 166 pounds.

The test aims to assess the aircraft’s durability and energy storage capacity. Powered by solar energy, the Zephyr is considered a performance heavyweight in ultra-light aircraft. It can be used for surveillance and intelligence gathering, with a wide visual payload coverage of 20 by 30 kilometers (12.4-18.6 miles). The drone can also be equipped with radar, lidar and infrared technologies to expand its capabilities.

Michael Monteleone, the director of the APNT/Space CFT, said there has been significant progress in the development high-altitude platforms such as Zephyr in recent years.

“This experimentation allows us to build on that knowledge by demonstrating multiple payload types, fully exploring the military utility of stratospheric operations, and modernizing areas of deep sensing, long-range targeting and resilient communications,” he said in a statement. “Ultra-long endurance unmanned platforms have the potential to provide significant military capabilities and enhanced confidence as part of the Army’s diversified multi-layered architecture.”

As part of the test, the Zephyr completed its first venture into “international airspace” and over water, the statement said. It also marked the aircraft’s longest continuous flight using satellite communication controls.

A second Zephyr flight will launch in the coming weeks and travel over the Pacific Ocean. It will study the Zephyr’s ability to carry a payload designed by AFC over multiple combatant commands.

Airbus tests A400M military plane as water bomber - Tech Xplore,"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHhwbG9yZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLTA3LWFpcmJ1cy1hNDAwbS1taWxpdGFyeS1wbGFuZS1ib21iZXIuaHRtbNIBSmh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHhwbG9yZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLTA3LWFpcmJ1cy1hNDAwbS1taWxpdGFyeS1wbGFuZS1ib21iZXIuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The A400M can accurately drop payloads of water at very low heights.

Airbus said Tuesday it had successfully tested its A400M military transporter as a water bomber as heatwaves cause an increasing number of wildfires during the summer in Europe.

""Airbus has successfully tested a removable firefighting demonstrator kit on the A400M new generation airlifter during a flight test campaign in Spain,"" the European plane maker said in a statement.

The test involved dropping 20 tonnes of water in less than 10 seconds, the statement said.

Airbus said that the roll-on/roll-off kit requires no modification to the A400M aircraft.

The water is stored in a fixed tank in the cargo hold, and retained by two independent doors. These doors are connected to two flood pipes, so when the discharge is triggered, the water is expelled through two sections at the end of the ramp.

Because of its low-level flight capability and manoeuvrability at low speeds, the A400M can accurately drop payloads of water at very low heights, down to 150 feet (50 metres), Airbus said.

""The development of this firefighting kit is an intrinsic part of our journey towards helping to create a more sustainable and safer world, not only by our actions but also through our products,"" said Mike Schoellhorn, head of Airbus Defence and Space.

""We strongly believe the A400M can play a vital role in the fight against the ever-increasing threat posed by wildfires and support the restoration of social and environmental systems.""

Airbus's deputy head of military aircraft, Jean-Brice Dumont, said that the aim of using the A400M as a water bomber was not to compete with those of rival Canadair, but to complement them.

Canadair's water bombers have capacity of 6,000 litres—only a third of that of the A400M. But while the Canadair water bomber can scoop up water from a lake, the A400M needs to land to refill its water tanks.

Scientists say human-induced climate change is amplifying extreme weather—including the heatwaves, droughts and floods seen in several parts of the planet in recent weeks—and say these events will become more frequent and more intense.

Canada moves forward with acquisition of first 2 Airbus A330-200s for RCAF future tanker - Skies Magazine,"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vc2tpZXNtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvY2FuYWRhLW1vdmVzLWZvcndhcmQtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tZmlyc3QtMi1haXJidXMtYTMzMC1haXJjcmFmdC1yY2FmLWZ1dHVyZS10YW5rZXIv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly9za2llc21hZy5jb20vbmV3cy9jYW5hZGEtbW92ZXMtZm9yd2FyZC1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbi1maXJzdC0yLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzMwLWFpcmNyYWZ0LXJjYWYtZnV0dXJlLXRhbmtlci8_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Dayna Fedy-MacDonald | July 14, 2022 Dayna Fedy-MacDonald |

Estimated reading time 5 minutes, 17 seconds.

In a surprise move on July 14, Canada announced that it has finalized a contract to acquire the first two aircraft for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) that will provide a strategic transport and air-to-air refuelling role — currently fulfilled by the fleet of five CC-150 Polaris aircraft — as part of the Strategic Tanker Transport Capability (STTC) project.

Airbus Defence and Space, and its A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) aircraft, was the only bidder to qualify for the project in April 2021. Today’s announcement means two A330-200 aircraft will be prepared to meet the requirements of the RCAF. The aircraft are used — manufactured in 2015 and previously leased and operated by Kuwait Airways — and are currently in commercial configuration.

The contract for the procurement and preparation of the two Airbus A330-200s was awarded to global aircraft leasing company, International AirFinance Corporation (the owner of the A330s), and is valued at US$102 million (taxes excluded).

The two commercial aircraft will later be modified by Airbus Defence and Space into the MRTT configuration to serve as multirole aircraft within Canada’s STTC fleet.

According to the Department of National Defence (DND), several allied nations have procured used A330-200 aircraft and have worked or are working with Airbus to convert those aircraft to the MRTT configuration to support their operations.

Canada’s eventual STTC fleet is anticipated to be six aircraft, which includes the first two A330-200s.

The A330s will replace the RCAF’s CC-150 Polaris aircraft (a modified variant of the Airbus A310-300), which have been in service since 1992. The Polaris provides the majority of air-to-air refuelling for the RCAF’s fighter fleet, and also fulfills other roles including military personnel and cargo airlift; strategic Government of Canada personnel transport; and medical evacuations.

“After nearly 30 years of outstanding service [with the Polaris fleet], the RCAF is looking to the future of this crucial capability, and with today’s announcement, we are moving forward to the next step of the Strategic Tanker Transport Capability (STTC) project,” a DND press release reads.

The Canadian government issued an invitation to qualify for the STTC project back in February 2021. The RCAF was seeking a multi-role platform that could be configured for air-to-air refuelling, personnel airlift, strategic government transport, and aeromedical evacuations, among other roles. The aircraft required the capacity to detect, avoid, and defeat air-to-air and ground-to-air threats, and needed to be capable of refuelling allied fighter jets on NATO and NORAD operations in a tanker role.

Both Boeing and Airbus made offers, but only Airbus’s offering made the cut. The OEM referred to its A330 MRTT aircraft as “the only new generation, combat-proven, multirole tanker available.”

Boeing had offered its KC-46 Pegasus, a militarized variant of the 767 widebody, but was informed in April 2021 that its aircraft did not qualify for the project.

The DND confirmed that the A330 STTC fleet will “play an integral role in providing air-to-air refuelling, strategic airlift, aeromedical evacuations, and strategic Government of Canada personnel transport.” The aircraft will also be equipped to airlift large numbers of CAF personnel and their equipment in support of operations and training activities within Canada — which will augment the existing transport capacity provided by the CC-177 Globemaster and CC-130J Hercules fleets.

The first two aircraft are expected to arrive in Canada in the winter of 2023; while they are currently configured for long-haul commercial use, the DND said they may be placed into early service in passenger/cargo roles as they await their modification to military specifications."

Under the agreement, Airbus Helicopters and Airbus Defence and Space will work together with Singapore to co-create and implement a unique data pipeline capable of exchanging maintenance data automatically and securely between RSAF’s and Airbus Helicopters’ IT systems. Both parties will also explore the shared use of maintenance data from existing in-service aircraft information systems.

The addition of helicopters comes on top of the collaborative agreement between DSTA and Airbus’ Defence and Space division to advance cooperation in the design and certification of parts produced by additive manufacturing, and in data analytics for predictive maintenance of its A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) aircraft.

Once the data pipeline is in place, Airbus Helicopters will be able to capitalise upon the company’s SmartForce suite of data analytics services to make recommendations that will improve fleet efficiency and optimise maintenance operations for RSAF’s fleet of H225Ms. The RSAF will be Airbus Helicopters’ first military operator to benefit from this data pipeline as part of the SmartForce solution. Services within the SmartForce portfolio include fleet planning and predictive maintenance.

“Airbus Helicopters is proud to be joining forces with Airbus Defence and Space and DSTA to build an innovative technical solution that will pave the way for future digital products and services for the military market,” says Christoph Zammert, executive vice president of Customer Support & Services at Airbus Helicopters. “By unlocking the intelligence hidden inside their data, our customers will be able to better anticipate unplanned maintenance needs, reduce maintenance downtime, improve helicopter availability and optimise their budget expenditures.”

The co-development agreement signed at the Singapore Airshow saw DSTA extending its earlier partnership announced in 2018 to intensify technology exchange and collaboration for the development of digital products and services, specifically for RSAF’s fleet of A330 MRTT.

“SAF is the short-term solution, and for long-haul flights probably the long-term one, and it's compatible with today's aircraft technology,” Faury told Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.

“But I also believe that hydrogen is the long-term solution to our net zero goal and that we need to start now.”

The European aircraft manufacturer still plans to bring at least one H 2 -powered commercial airplane to the market by 2035, and will determine the technology used for it in 2025, choosing from three different concepts first unveiled in 2020.

Although the design hasn’t been chosen yet, Faury said the company’s first hydrogen airplane is likely to be a smaller model, to be used on regional routes that make up a substantial part of air travel.

But the CEO also dampened the anticipation regarding a rapid ramp-up of H 2 -powered aviation.

“Hydrogen won’t deliver a great contribution to CO 2 reductions in the year 2050, but there will be a time after that,” he told the newspaper.

“Everyone is so focused on the year 2050, because that is the target. But it will be a very inefficient net zero, and it will take us decades to make it efficient.”

Airbus together with utility Uniper, energy tech company Siemens Energy and chemicals firm Sasol ecoFT last month had announced to carry out a feasibility study on producing SAFs based on green hydrogen made from renewable energy under the ‘Green Fuels for Hamburg’ initiative.

If feasible, the group would produce at least 10,000 tonnes of green kerosene per year for aviation in the first expansion stage from 2026 on, which can be used on conventional aircraft but at an elevated price.

Producing decarbonised aviation fuel at first will “cost a lot of energy and be expensive”, Faury acknowledged."

Viasat selected by Virgin Atlantic for IFC on their new Airbus A330-900 Fleet – SatNews - news.satnews.com,"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5zYXRuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzE1L3ZpYXNhdC1zZWxlY3RlZC1ieS12aXJnaW4tYXRsYW50aWMtZm9yLWlmYy1vbi10aGVpci1uZXctYWlyYnVzLWEzMzAtOTAwLWZsZWV0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Viasat Inc. (NASDAQ: VSAT) has announced that Virgin Atlantic has selected Viasat’s IFC solution for their new, Airbus A330-900 aircraft.

Viasat’s IFC system can enable high quality, full video streaming, browsing, messaging, social media scrolling and more to every connected device on the aircraft, operating with a level of connectivity made possible through the Company’s robust satellite network capacity.

The Viasat IFC equipment will be factory-installed (“linefit“) on the 16 new Virgin Atlantic Airbus A330-900s at the Airbus Center of Excellence production site in Toulouse, France, ensuring in-flight internet service is available on each aircraft upon delivery. Virgin Atlantic’s fleet of Airbus A330-900s is scheduled to enter service with intercontinental flights between the Americas and the United Kingdom in the second half of this year.

Viasat’s ability to deliver an exceptional internet experience on Virgin Atlantic’s new fleet will be enabled, in part, by two factors: industry-leading capacity across Viasat’s planned global satellite network and the Company’s ability to leverage that capacity efficiently.

The critical challenge to great connectivity in aviation is that passenger demand is exponentially higher in the most heavily concentrated geographical areas, such as large airport hub cities (London and New York, for example) and busy flight corridors. The adaptability of Viasat’s satellite network is designed to meet this demand density challenge with ample capacity, which is critical to address the continually rising data requirements of the most bandwidth intensive applications of the internet.

Virgin Atlantic’s Airbus A330-900s Fast in-flight internet connections are made possible by connecting passenger devices directly to Viasat’s network of owned and partner Ka-band satellites. Viasat’s onboard equipment on Virgin Atlantic’s new aircraft is designed to be forward-compatible with the Company’s next-generation satellite constellation, ViaSat-3, offering Virgin Atlantic additional capacity and expanded global coverage.

Don Buchman, Viasat’s vice president and general manager, Commercial Aviation, said, “We’re thrilled that Virgin Atlantic – an airline with innovation and customer service at its core — has chosen Viasat as its IFC partner on its new Airbus aircraft. We have a strong history of delivering quality IFC on long-haul flights and look forward to bringing our technology and service capabilities to Virgin Atlantic and its customers.”

Airbus Joins Forces With Seven Airlines On Carbon Capture Initiative - Aviation Week,"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2xvY2F0aW9uL2FpcmJ1cy1qb2lucy1mb3JjZXMtc2V2ZW4tYWlybGluZXMtY2FyYm9uLWNhcHR1cmUtaW5pdGlhdGl2ZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus and seven major airline groups will jointly explore the potential of a technology called direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), in which CO 2 emissions are removed from the air using high-powered fans and then securely stored underground in saline formations.

Air Canada, Air France-KLM, easyJet, International Airlines Group (IAG), LATAM Airlines Group, Lufthansa Group and Virgin Atlantic will work with Airbus to negotiate the pre-purchase of carbon-removal credits, covering 400,000 tonnes of DACCS emissions reductions over the period from 2025 through to 2028. These credits will be secured through DACCS specialist 1PointFive.

Airbus initiated the group purchase after forming a partnership with 1PointFive, which is aiming to recycle the captured carbon into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

When asked why the airlines would want to acquire the credits through Airbus, easyJet sustainability director Jane Ashton said DACCS is a “nascent technology,” so collaboration with Airbus and other airlines is a way that the industry can get involved at an early stage in DACCS’ development.

Stan Shparberg, Airbus' head of marketing, added that this collaboration forms part of Airbus’ own sustainability strategy, rather than being a business-development area.

However, DACCS is a new area for aviation and Airbus Head of Sustainability & Environment Nicolas Chretien noted there is no international framework for negative emissions. This means that the DACCS credits may not be recognized under the European Union emissions trading scheme (EU ETS) or the ICAO/United Nations CORSIA initiative until the second half of the decade.

“Today direct air carbon capture and storage is not recognized under CORSIA,” 1PointFive International President Steve Kelly confirmed, speaking at a Farnborough Airshow press conference organized by Airbus on July 18.

Kelly said the United Nations will first need to reach agreement on a long-term climate goal for the global aviation sector, which will be discussed this September and October in Montreal, noting that this will hopefully institutionalize the industry’s net zero strategy. Once this has been established, the role of DACCS could be discussed.

Acceptance under the EU ETS will require a different approach and there is a “dedicated agenda” that 1PointFive is looking at. “We still are hopeful that we should be able to bring direct our carbon capture and storage onto the EU ETS, probably towards the second half of this decade,” Kelly said.

The idea behind this initiative is that DACCS would allow the aviation sector to extract emissions directly from atmospheric air. This would be a top-up measure in addition to other CO 2 reductions, such as SAF, to address remaining emissions that cannot be directly eliminated.

DACCS has been recognized by climate scientists, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

“In addition to CO 2 capture and storage, the technology opens up very interesting perspectives for the production of synthetic sustainable aviation fuel,” Air France-KLM VP of Sustainability Fatima da Gloria de Sousa said.

1PointFive , which is a subsidiary of Occidental’s Low Carbon Ventures business, is responsible for the deployment of direct air capture company Carbon Engineering. These companies will start constructing a DACCS facility in Texas later this year, ready for launch in 2024. Once operational, they claim the facility will be able to remove 1 million tonnes of carbon per year.

The panelists were quizzed on whether storing carbon emissions is the equivalent of landfill and on whether there might be a risk of the storage being compromised. They said that the processes involved are well-understood and capturing the carbon is a building block towards using the emissions for sustainable fuel.

Airbus is aiming to be carbon neutral across all its aircraft production plans by 2030. The airframer has already committed to 400,000 tonnes of DACCS emissions reductions over the period from 2025 through to 2028, with options to extend this volume in future. No pricing was disclosed, but Chretien from Airbus said that a large buyers’ alliance means the companies can secure a better price than individual efforts."

One million tonnes of CO2 will be captured at a new Texas site by 2024 and then permanently stored in old oil wells.

Both companies stressed that Sustainability is, like Safety, not a competition item; instead, we must all contribute, and there is no single solution or entity that will get us to net zero by 2050.

Air Transport Sustainability gets real

It was fitting that the Monday at Farnborough International Airshow was the hottest in British history with 39°C/102F. Global warming is real, and it’s going faster than we all would like.

The message from Boeing and Airbus was the time for talk and posturing is over, and it’s now concrete actions that count.

Boeing emphasized it’s not a Sustainability laggard; it has just chosen a realistic path. There are over 20,000 aircraft flying each day, and any new aircraft type (hydrogen or whatever) will turn the Global Warming dials little by 2050.

The reality is that we need massive investment in SAF as all aircraft can fly on it in blended form, and the replacement of old gas guzzlers with new economic planes is the other major action we can do that has a real effect.

To get us all to realize the actual effects of, say, introducing a new propulsion type to regional aircraft by the second half of this decade will have a minuscule 0.5% effect on our CO2 footprint by 2050, Boeing has developed Cascade (Figure 1).

Cascade is a data modeling tool Boeing created in cooperation with leading universities. The tool appraises the potential for different technologies and actions to reduce emissions through:

Airplane fleet renewal

Renewable energy sources such as sustainable fuel, hydrogen, electric propulsion

Operational efficiency improvements

Other advanced technologies

The Cascade model assesses the full lifecycle impacts of renewable energy by accounting for the emissions required to produce, distribute and use alternative energy carriers such as hydrogen, electricity, and SAF.

Cascade is not ready for prime time yet (it’s in beta test with University partners), but once we can get our hands on it, we will review it. It’s a good approach, and we will all learn a lot from it, is my feeling. Its results will, of course, depend on the assumptions driving the model, but these are things that can be tuned.

Airbus, et al

Airbus and Air Canada, Air France-KLM, easyJet, IAG, LATAM, Lufthansa, and Virgin Atlantic have all committed to buying 400,000 tonnes of Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage from 1PointFive, an Airbus partner for Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage, Figure 2.

“The Direct Carbon Capture is established technology, and the storing of the CO2 in used Oil wells builds on the extensive knowledge we have from using CO2 injection to the wells to further the extraction of oil,” says the CEO of 1PointFive, Steve Kelly. “Our 1 million tonne facility will be placed in Texas where we have suitable wells for storage and extensive knowledge of the technology.”

“The Direct Carbon Capture with Storage is an important technology, but it’s also a component of producing SAF from water electrolysis where we need to add Carbon to a Hydrogen intermediate step,” says Airbus Head of Sustainability & Environment Nicolas Chretien. “This makes Carbon Capture so interesting. Carbon Capture it’s an affordable and scalable complement to other actions, and today’s record heats show we are already late and need all means we have. Sustainability is, like Safety, not a competitive item. We all need to cooperate to achieve our 2050 goal of net-zero emissions.”

Rush Transcript

Joe Anselmo:

Welcome to Check-6 from Farnborough I'm Joe Anselmo, Aviation Week's editorial director. In the run up to this year's show, our editors sat down with the CEOs of Airbus and Boeing, and they both had some very interesting things to say.

Joining me to provide you with a behind the scenes look are some of those editors, Jens Flottau, our executive editor for commercial aviation, interviewed Airbus's Guillaume Faury at the recent Berlin Air Show. And editors Guy Norris and Sean Broderick joined me for a sit down with Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun at the company's headquarters near Washington.

Sean and Guy let's start with you guys because Calhoun made some real news in his sitdown with us. He said if Congress doesn't change the law so that the 737 MAX 10 can be certified with the common flight deck as its smaller MAX cousins, he'll shelve the aircraft. That would leave the Airbus A321neo without a competitor at the top of the narrowbody market. The MAX 10 has already attracted more than 600 orders, almost half from United Airlines. He's really playing a game of chicken with Congress. Pretty high stakes here.

Sean Broderick:

The most interesting takeaway is that we have, I won't say absolute certainty, but it's pretty clear that Boeing's intention with the 737-10 is to build it and keep the commonality with the rest of the family. And it will not, and has no plans, to develop a version with an upgraded flight crew alerting system or an ICAS as, as Boeing calls it.

A very brief bit of background, as most listeners probably know there is a law that goes into effect at the end of this year, that was put in place at the end of 2020, that gave the FAA a two-year window to certify new airplanes that do not comply with the current flight crew alerting rules. Boeing has been getting exemptions -- and Guy can correct me if I'm wrong on this -- but I believe the ICAS exemptions on the 737 date all the way back to the 737-300. They're not all the same, necessarily, exemptions. The rules have changed since the last update was in 2010, but the bottom line is that Congress wants all airplanes to be delivered now with updated systems that help pilots troubleshoot issues.

The MAX is similar to the NG before it, and the Classic before that, and the very simple way to put it is it's the equivalent, almost the equivalent of an idiot light on a car. Something lights up when there's a system that's going wrong, but it's really up to the pilot to troubleshoot and figure it out using quick reference handbooks or memory. The thinking going into the interview, at least from my standpoint, was that Boeing would at least have to consider developing the 737-10 to meet the rules because it will not be certified by the end of the year. That's sort of the other thing that's important in all this is that the added time needed to certify airplanes in general and the extra scrutiny that Boeing is getting is dragging the certification of both that airplane and the -7 out.

The same rule applies to -7, looks like it's going to be certified by the end of the year, but the -10 for a variety of reasons, not going to happen. And it appears as though that Calhoun has laid down his cards and said, ‘Look, either we get the exemption from Congress, not the FAA, or we kill the program.’

Joe Anselmo:

Guy, I know we had a lot of back and forth with [Calhoun] trying to pry out from him exactly what Boeing's position was. And then he just put it on the table. Did that surprise you?

Guy Norris:

Well you're right, Joe, he did. In fact, at the very end, it was almost between you, me and Sean, who was like, well, hang on a minute, did we get it correct that you were actually saying, ‘I will not develop this airplane if that's what happens and I'm not afraid to say that,’ and we just had to sort of double check it a couple of times, didn't we, to sort of make sure he really meant that and sure enough, he did. And I think it's also significant that here at the show, we're seeing the 737, the 10 and the 777-X in the display here. So that's a sort of another sign of how bullish they are that the industry itself will kind of push this over the line and that they're going to be confident that an airplane that's flying in development and here at Farnborough is actually going to be ready as part of their product lineup next year. A Congress be damned sort of thing.

Joe Anselmo:

Well, well, speaking of confident, he also appeared to be upbeat that the company's long problems with the 787 are nearing an end. Did you get that sense?

Guy Norris:

Yeah. I mean, Sean, maybe you want to chime in on this because you've been following it so closely, but I know that from my perspective, it seemed like, yes, he was kind of giving this very strong hints that the 787 backlog, the sort of bottleneck at deliveries, was about to be released, finally. In a couple of months, at least, we're going to start seeing deliveries resume.

I don't know if Sean's going to say something on that, but from my perspective longer term, what I was really interested in was also his comments about the freighter. We sort of said, ‘Hey, you've got this issue coming up with missions regulations on the 767. You're going to have to do something to refresh the product line. Are you going to appeal it? Are you thinking about a 787 freighter, which is long been thought of? And he sort of said, ‘Yes, all of the above.’ So it was like, whoa, that's pretty impressive.

And the reason I think that's significant, beyond it being a new freighter, is the fact that -- do you know that it's 15 years ago now that the 787 rolled out? And that's just an amazing amount of time. So if you go ahead a few years to the end of the decade, it gives Boeing a really good chance to completely do a sort of block point change on that program. Maybe re-engining I don't know. So I don't know. I thought that was an interesting thing. What about you, Sean?

Sean Broderick:

Agree on the 787. It sounds as though, I mean, they haven't delivered any airplanes in more than a year really, aside from a short spate of deliveries in early ‘20, I guess it was ‘21. I have to start doing math on this. They haven't delivered any for 18 months, and clearly the FAA is being diligent, [that’s] putting it mildly, in ensuring that Boeing has a plan to both inspect and repair every airframe. And so they're about 120 now. It sounds like they're close, but it sounds like that FAA is simply not letting Boeing to come back to anything in the future with the undelivered airplanes. They’ve still got a bunch of the delivered airplanes that may need some sort of work during scheduled maintenance or whatever. But I mean, clearly for Boeing, they need to get those deliveries going.

It sounds as though that maybe by the end of the summer, it'll finally be done, but how many times have we said that now? And to be clear, Calhoun did not say that. Calhoun is not putting deadlines on any of this. He's signaling confidence and sort of a general upbeat approach, and we are taking some of this from his cues. He's not drawing any lines in the sand with regard to anything in FAA's hands.

Joe Anselmo:

And Sean, you pressed him on that. You said that this scrutiny has gotten so rigorous, at what point does it threaten the business? Does it threaten to harm the business? And he didn't bite, did he? He was not pointing fingers.

Sean Broderick:

No, he, I mean, he made a comment about there, if you go back and review everything that's happened since the MAX are grounding, there may have been a few things that in other circumstances could have been handled differently, or might have been handled differently. But he recognizes the scrutiny that Boeing has attracted through its own missteps and also that the FAA is sort of revamping how it conducts oversight and surveillance. Some of it required by new laws, and some of it the FAA has seen is necessary. And Boeing as far from the only one that's affected, we've had stories about Gulfstream and Rolls Royce affected just by the FAA changes and then more globally. I mean, the Airbus is having some, it's safe to say they're having some unexpected timeline challenges with the [A321] XLR and that's primarily from, from EASA scrutiny.

So it's a changing landscape, but yeah, at some point, though, you have to look at like in the 787's case, you have hundreds of airplanes out there flying with the same problems that the airplanes that are undelivered have. We realize it's a compliance issue, that's no minor thing in our world, but you have to wonder for the suppliers that are feeding that program and have absolutely no visibility on production plans. You always have to balance the safety aspect with the business continuity aspect. Because as a Mitre report that came out not too long ago said, the only safe airplane is the one that's not in the air. So there always has to be a risk balance there. And we tried to get at that with Calhoun and to his credit he said, ‘Listen, we got to do what the regulators tell us to do, full stop. And then we can talk about doing anything else.’

Joe Anselmo:

I want to move on to Jens to talk about Airbus. But one final thing, obviously Boeing has just been getting pounded out there for not dragging its feet, but you know, not moving forward with the new airplane to blunt, Airbus's dominance of the upper end of the narrowbody market. Guy, he didn't give any ground there, did he? He said, ‘I'm going to take my time and do this, right.’

Guy Norris:

You're right, Joe. He didn't sort of really budge. But, I tell you what, he doubled down again on the model-based system engineering approach, which they've overemphasized in the last couple of months, has got to be tying both airplane development and production together, as one. And kind of like when they manage to join those two and scale them up, that's when things will be ready to go.

One thing that is interesting though, the last time he talked about it in any detail was really a couple years ago when most people really hadn't heard about MBE, but this talk was linked very much to NMA. NMA will be, that'll [was going to be] their airplane next. ‘And by the way, we don't really need a massively new engine for that. It's going to be just, it doesn't need to be a big leap.’ This time, he's saying very much the opposite. ‘It's all to do with still MBE. But yes, we do need an engine.’ And that change to me is very subtle, but it indicates quite clearly that their thinking is now going be when they do an airplane, it's going to be a single aisle. And that's why this is a bit even further down the road now.

Joe Anselmo:

And what's revolutionary about MBE, correct me if I'm wrong, is that, today if you launch a new airplane, people say it's going to be about 8-10 years to get the market. MBE should really, in theory, enable them to speed a new airplane to market much faster, correct?

Guy Norris:

Theoretically, yes. Of course. It may just in fact allow them to do it at the same time as they could have done 10 years ago before regulatory things got so much more difficult. They may be standing still in that. The other thing it may also allow them to do is see big problems coming down the track earlier. So they'd avoided issues that have say on the 787, for example, they would see that ahead of time. So, yeah. Interesting.

Joe Anselmo:

Jens, speaking of new airplanes asked Faury about new airplanes. What did he tell you?

Jens Flottau:

Well, we asked him about Boeing's strategy and whether he thought that they should come up with something new and you, well, don't ask me about Boeing's product strategy. But we insisted, and so he said, ‘I don't see how one could launch an aircraft today with conventional technologies with so many breakthroughs five years down the road. I would not do it for Airbus’. That's what he said. So I think you have to break this into a few parts here, because you need to obviously look at what is revolutionary in 2035, which is what he's referring to. There's two elements of that. One is, Airbus's ZEROe project, the big hydrogen research and development program that is supposed to lead to a aircraft hydrogen powered aircraft by 2035. And the other big project is on the engine side, led by GE and Safran, the Rise engine that could power a more conventional aircraft as well.

I'm not sure I completely buy his point about why would you do something conventional now when there's something so much better in 2035. If you look at the hydrogen aircraft that Airbus is proposing, it's surely going to be much smaller than a narrowbody today, well less than 100 seats is my guess, and up to 1,000 nautical miles. So that's not something that a narrowbody would compete with typically. And if you turn the argument around, you could still do something advanced, but conventional and not be threatened by what's coming in '35. I guess there's an element of wishful thinking there on the Airbus side, because if Boeing really goes ahead with something new, then that would have to trigger an Airbus response as well. And of course, that's the last thing Airbus wants. They want to focus on the long-term technology programs while harvesting the success of the through 320neo family to the extent possible. So it's not only just for Boeing to launch something new.

Joe Anselmo:

You know Jens, Calhoun told us that to get to net zero emissions by 2050 by Boeing's calculations, hydrogen will only be 1% of the solution -- that hydrogen is coming, but it's in the second half of the century. I was interesting that Faury seemed to acknowledge to you that hydrogen is only going to play a small role in the near term, in the solution.

Jens Flottau:

Yeah, it's interesting because having followed the discussion of the last year or two, people seem to have come to the conclusion that Boeing is the SAF company and is the hydrogen company. That's not really true. Actually, when we came into the interview, we asked him, ‘Do you want to talk about defense first or commercial?’ And he said, ‘I want to talk about hydrogen first’. It was really top of his agenda. So we talked about hydrogen, but the point he was making is that by 2050, hydrogen will be a very small part of the fuels that are available to aviation. I guess that's more or less, what's what Calhoun said too, right? I think Calhoun said 1%, Faury says a small part. But he does say that by the end of the century, it's going to be a very significant part of the aviation fuels available by then.So the difference between the two might be actually smaller than people seem to think these days.

And on the other hand, Faury made very clear, he was very, very concerned about the slow pickup of SAF, sustainable aviation fuels. He said he was desperate two years ago by watching things not happening, people not investing. But he's now amazed at the speed at which people are picking up launching projects, investing in projects and actually Airbus itself is investing now. They are together with Qantas investing into a fund in Australia that is supposed to develop soft production in the country. That's of course, part of the big, big Airbus order that Qantas placed to the other day. So, long story short, in the long term development timeline the perspectives, Boeing and Airbus may actually be closer than many people think.

Joe Anselmo:

Interesting. Well, let's talk Jens, about the immediate term. A big theme at the show is going to be the supply chain meltdown, the air framers can't get engines. We asked Calhoun about it and Calhoun said, Hey, we could produce twice as many MAXs -- they're aiming for 31 a month. He said, ‘We could produce 60 a month just based on demand, but we can't.’ And he said, ‘It's simply about the engines. It's just about the engines.’ You heard something similar from Airbus, no?

Jens Flottau:

Yeah, and I asked him if Boeing doesn't launch a new aircraft, then of course your market share must be growing further in the narrowbody market in the next few years. And he said, ‘I'm not sure because it's a supply constrained market. We would build a lot more aircraft if we could, if we had enough engines, if you had enough cabin monuments,’ you name it. So, yeah it's a big issue. Basically he said the supply chain is behind the curve. They've fallen behind. He criticized the supply chain for not having listened to Airbus a year ago when they started to explain to them what the production plan was that they would slowly want to move to 75 in 2025, 75 aircraft per month. And no one wanted to listen. And so now that's where we are.

There's not enough engines. There's not enough cabin monuments, whatever. There's not enough raw materials in some areas. But he says, it's too soon to give up on production targets, the Airbus target to remind everyone is 720 commercial aircraft this year. They were slow in the first four, five months. June was better at 60. That was okay. But he says, ‘I'm going to slow down the day I see that I cannot can no longer achieve my targets, but we're far from that point.’ And he believes that engine manufacturers will pick up, will speed up. And at the end of the day, they will be okay. We'll see.

Joe Anselmo:

We're starting to run short on time, but I wanted to sort of wrap this up, first of all, by saying I admired that Calhoun had the courage to sit down with us and face the fire. He doesn't give a lot of interviews and he's been under withering criticism this year. I went back and looked before the last Farnborough, we interviewed as predecessor, Dennis Muilenburg. And our first question for Muilenburg was, ‘Is there no more boom-bust cycle in commercial aircraft?’ You couldn't get much more softball than that, right? And our first question for Calhoun this year was, ‘Boeing is $44 billion in net debt. First and second quarter earnings were full of charges. You haven't been able to deliver 787s for more than a year. And the 777X program has had repeated delays. Are these not signs of a company in disarray?’ Guy you're chuckling there, but his response was, ‘No, they're not. They're signs of a company coming back.’ He wasn't given any ground, was he?

Guy Norris:

No, he wasn't. When you say he was on message in a way that message is sort of strengthened [from] the past. So to me -- and Sean, you probably got the same message as well -- It feels like that all of these catastrophic and dangerous issues that have really bedeviled them, at least if they're not over, they can see that light at the end of the tunnel for all of it. Cause he was very confident. He wasn't just pulling the wool over our eyes. I really felt he meant it. And so I think that if you were in those board meetings and you were really seeing the inside track, you would see, yep, this should be done by, September October, I got that feeling that they could see their way through all of this.

Sean Broderick:

The key is closing some of these deals, so to speak. I mean, we have heard confidence coming out of the top office at Boeing numerous times over the last three years. And you can pick your topic. I mean, if they are indeed really close on getting the 787, and if they can deliver the MAX family as they want, if their safety arguments hold and they get their needed waivers. And if these new programs that are coming down the pike at some point are delivered on time and within performance, there's a lot of ifs, right. They know more than we do. I hope he knows more than we do. So what he sees is, he's expressing confidence.

At the same time, I guess I'll play devil's advocate and say, what option does he have? He's not going to tell everybody, ‘Oh man, it's just continual suckage and we don't see that changing.’ I mean, I don't think you keep your position very long if you do that. But it was convincing. I do agree. I walked out of the interview thinking that Boeing was in better shape than I did when I walked in. And I guess that's the message

Guy Norris:

Just one last observation from me as well, Sean, on that point, I'd just been to Boeing to spend a couple of days on pre-Farnborough briefings at that time. I'm not saying there wasn't doom and gloom, I mean, there was still that kind of uncertainty in the air, but there was definitely optimism that I had not seen there for two years. And a lot of it was backed up by very basic engineering knowhow, progress in certain areas and the plan going forward, which seemed to be executable and was not just pie in the sky. And I definitely got that feeling from those briefings. So when Dave Calhoun came up with that, I was going, this is on that message. And I think he genuinely believes it.

Sean Broderick:

Right. The head, the headlines don't capture the depth of work that's going on in any of these companies. Boeing's had their share of its share of negative headlines over the last three years. And it probably, it doesn't do justice to the work that's been going on to recover. And also that has nothing to do with the troubled programs. There is a lot of good work that's gone on throughout at Boeing. And I think that is part of the message that gets lost.

Joe Anselmo:

Okay, gentlemen, well, we could sit here and talk for another hour about all this, but we've got an air show to go to. So, thank you all for your time and for your insights. That is a wrap for this week's Check 6. Special thanks to our producer Guy Ferneyhough.

Airbus prepares contrail flight tests - Leeham News and Analysis,"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8yMS9haXJidXMtcHJlcGFyZXMtY29udHJhaWwtZmxpZ2h0LXRlc3RzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"July 21, 2022, © Leeham News at Farnborough Air Show: Airbus is converting two Arcus high-altitude gliders to check if the contrails produced by hydrogen combustion engines create an environmental problem.

The background is that experts can’t agree if the water vapor produced by hydrogen combustion (which merges hydrogen with oxygen to water) can cause global warming or not. The only way to resolve the dispute and gain fundamental knowledge is to fly and measure.

Airbus’ Blue Condor program conducts flight trials on the contrail issue

The big question mark for propulsion with hydrogen-burning gas turbines is if these produce troublesome levels of persistent contrails at high altitudes or not. If they do, such contrails will contribute to global warming.

Experts have analyzed the problem for decades but can’t agree on whether it’s a problem or not. One camp says the contrails will definitely contribute to global warming. While the H2-burning jet aircraft will emit no CO2, thus alleviating the CO2 load in the atmosphere, persistent contrails will be equally bad.

Another camp of experts believes it will be no big problem. The ice crystals produced will be larger than the crystals of today’s contrails and, therefore, will not stay airborne for long.

Aircraft and engine manufacturers can’t live with this lack of certainty. The solution is to get a hydrogen-burning aircraft to the altitudes where this problem appears (typical jet altitudes of 30,000ft or more) and fly a measurement aircraft in the emitted contrails.

German DLR (the German NASA) has developed a measurement methodology and aircraft (Figure 2) and is an authority on the subject. What was missing was a hydrogen combusting aircraft. Airbus would get its test A380 airborne with a hydrogen combustion GE Passport engine by 2026.

But this is late. The industry needs data now. If this is a problem, there are things that can be done, like the collection of the water by condensation in the engine exhaust nozzle, but this needs development time and, therefore, early warning.

Airbus solved the problem in an innovative way. In its Blue Condor program, it equips two Arcus gliders with jet engines (Figure 1). One has a hydrogen-burning engine; the other burns our usual Jet-A1 kerosene.

By flying these gliders in front of the DLR measurement aircraft, one after the other, the formation process of contrails from the hydrogen combustion can be studied (ice crystal size, amount, etc.) at the same time as reference data from normal combustion is gathered. By virtue of the Jet-A1 reference data, the scaling to actual size engines can be made.

The best part of the story is we don’t have to wait long. The jet-converted glider has already performed its first flight, and test flights with both engine types will be done before the end of the year. The important test will then be done in a cold climate in North Dakota during spring 2023.

Other emissions

Hydrogen combustion also produces NOx emissions. There is plenty of knowledge on how to get this to about one-fifth the level of today’s engines by careful combustor design. The glider tests will also measure these emissions, but knowledge gaps are here less of a problem.

It’s a benefit that the DLR measurement aircraft can also trace these emissions, which will increase the NOx emissions understanding. But it’s questionable if this problem would have motivated such trials on its own. There is not the gaping hole in the knowledge around NOx emissions that we have for H2 combustion contrails.

Why the tests are important and timely

The swift action by Airbus is commendable. Instead of debating, it uses innovative means to get data for the most pressing problem of hydrogen combustion. The aim is to gain first knowledge, so the system decisions that must be made from now to 2026 can be based on knowledge and not assumptions.

Do these trials mean Airbus is leaning towards hydrogen burn instead of fuel cell propulsion? No, there are not enough results and data from the different Airbus research and test activities to point Airbus one way or the other, according to Sabine Klauke, Airbus CTO.

But this knowledge must be gathered over the next years if Airbus shall have an operational airliner by 2035. The glider tests are an essential part of the gathering of such insights.

Going back to the Moon couldn't happen without us - Airbus,"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLTA3LWdvaW5nLWJhY2stdG8tdGhlLW1vb24tY291bGRudC1oYXBwZW4td2l0aG91dC11c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"50 years after their last visit, humans will soon land on the Moon again.

Why the historic mission would not be possible without Airbus - hand in hand with the European Space Agency - and how it could enrich our lives on Earth - Guillaume Faury, Mike Schoellhorn and Jean-Marc Nasr exclusively provide all the details.

“NASA is going back to the Moon, and (...) it couldn’t happen without us (...). We are in charge of creating the powerhouse of the Orion spacecraft, called the European Service Module, ESM in short. This ESM will provide all the critical functions for the spacecraft including the propulsion and everything the astronauts will need to survive.”

Mike Schoellhorn, CEO Airbus Defence and Space

“It is truly inspiring that this marks the first time that NASA has chosen Airbus, a

company mainly based outside the US, to deliver critical functions for a spacecraft that

will carry humans into space.”

Guillaume Faury, CEO Airbus

“Just as we do not want to do to space what we have done to our oceans, we have a real responsibility in this new lunar epic. As a responsible company, we will continue to develop solutions to make this world safer, fairer and a better place to live.”

Jean-Marc Nasr, Head of Space Systems at Airbus

Inspiring new lunar epic

Gene Cernan was the last man on the Moon in 1972. The first woman will finally land there in 2025 - more than 50 years later. The historic mission begins this year: on 29th August 2022, the first uncrewed test flight, Artemis I, will lift off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. NASA's giant SLS rocket (Space Launch System) will then blast an uncrewed Orion capsule into space. There, the European Service Module (ESM-1) built by Airbusfor the European Space Agency will take over: It will propel Orion 70,000 kilometres around the Moon and return it safely to Earth. Airbus ESMs will also power the following Artemis missions that will ultimately bring humans back to the Moon - and ensure that the astronauts will have enough water and air to breathe on their way to our Earth’s satellite and back.
