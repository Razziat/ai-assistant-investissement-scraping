"Alabama opens training center for Airbus, aerospace expansion | Made in Alabama - Made In Alabama","Wed, 25 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hZGVpbmFsYWJhbWEuY29tLzIwMTQvMDYvYWxhYmFtYS1vcGVucy10cmFpbmluZy1jZW50ZXItZm9yLWFpcmJ1cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“This is more than a building. It’s actually a milestone,” Canfield said. “It’s the next step in a partnership. This is more than a training center … This building represents dreams. The people who come through here will see their lives changed forever.”

The Airbus assembly operation is viewed as a key development for Alabama’s aerospace sector, making the state one of only three in the U.S. where large passenger jets are assembled. Alabama’s aerospace industry comprises more than 300 companies, employing around 83,000 people.

Lt. Governor Kay Ivey said the job-training programs of AIDT provide a “solid foundation” for companies that operate in Alabama, while also enhancing the state’s economic development efforts.

“We have a slogan, ‘Made in Alabama’ — that slogan represents a source of pride in the dependability and productivity of our workforce,” she said at the grand opening event. “That combination of characteristics sets Alabama apart from other states.”

Allan McArtor, chairman and chief executive officer of Airbus Group Inc., said the Alabama Aviation Training Center will play an important role as the state’s aerospace industry continues to grow. “This is going to be a very impressive aerospace community. It all starts with people and this is where we train the people,” McArtor told AL.com. (Read an article on why Airbus chose Alabama.)

AIDT TRAINING EXPERTISE

AIDT Assistant Director Lee Hammett said the facility includes six classrooms and labs, making it capable of training scores of skilled workers that could end up assembling Airbus aircraft. Instruction at the center will focus on skills such as advanced materials composites, paint, electrical and welding that will be needed on the aviation giant’s FAL. Airbus and AIDT staffers will provide the training.

“Airbus is one of the great companies on the planet, and we are glad they are here in Alabama,” AIDT Director Ed Castile said at the ribbon cutting.

AIDT, a division of the Alabama Department of Commerce, helped build the state’s auto industry workforce, beginning with its Mercedes-Benz partnership forged in the early 1990s. AIDT also operates a martime training center in Mobile, providing skilled welders for companies such as Austal USA. Its expanding Robotics Technology Park near Decatur is considered a one-of-a-kind facility that Area Development magazine described as “ahead of the curve.”

AIDT recently teamed with the Birmingham Business Alliance and other organizations to open a training center in Alabama’s largest metro area for jobs in construction and manufacturing."
Airbus Used Its Best Employees as Guinea Pigs for Its New Plane - WIRED,"Wed, 04 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS8yMDE0LzA2L2FpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLWVtcGxveWVlLXRlc3Rpbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For most people, a seven-hour flight that lands exactly where it departed from is a special kind of torture. But for nearly 250 Airbus employees, it was a reward for their hard work. Based on the photos, they were totally thrilled.

Airbus is most of the way through the long march to certification of the Airbus A350-XWB, the wide-body commercial jet it's spent a decade working on. In the past year, four test planes have logged 1,600 hours. They've flown in extreme temperatures and at extreme altitudes and been hit with faux lightning strikes. An airframe built specifically for the purpose had its wings nearly broken in a machine that resembles a huge birdcage.

These tests prove the A350 is airworthy and safe, but they don't reveal anything about how it feels to spend hours in the cabin, which is what really matters to the people who ultimately will use the planes.

Enter the guinea pigs.

Airbus selected about 250 of its very best employees (all of them recommended by their managers) to take a ride and share their thoughts. On Monday, the A350 took off from the Airbus assembly plant in Toulouse, France, flew over Oslo, and landed in Toulouse seven hours later.

The flight simulated a “real airline environment,” complete with a cabin crew borrowed from Air France. The passengers endured a standard boarding process and put their bags in the overhead bins (it's not clear what they carried aboard. They received hot towels and were served what appears to be a good meal. On the entertainment systems, they played Sudoku, watched The Hobbit and The Big Bang Theory, and kept an eye on the flight map.

Afterward, they completed questionnaires, sharing their thoughts on everything from the in-flight entertainment system to how the storage bins worked. The crew reviewed the galleys, safety equipment, and their rest areas. The result was an airborne focus group that looked like a lot of fun. These people are rabid plane geeks, after all, and were the first passengers on an all-new airplane.

It was the first of two “Early Long Flights” planned this week; the second is a 12-hour overnight flight with a Lufthansa crew. Using employees as guinea pigs isn't just a European thing. Boeing did the same while testing the 787-8 and 747-8.

The widebody A350 is the second commercial jet (after the Boeing 787 Dreamliner) made largely of composite material. That will make it 25% more fuel efficient than comparable older jets, Airbus says, a huge selling point for the cash-strapped airline industry. Airbus has taken 812 orders from 39 customers and expects to begin deliveries later this year."
Airbus electric aircraft takes to the skies - CNN,"Wed, 11 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAxNC8wNi8xMS90ZWNoL2FpcmJ1cy1lbGVjdHJpYy1haXJjcmFmdC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN celebrates 100 years of commercial aviation with a week of programming presented by resident travel expert Richard Quest.

Story highlights Electric hybrid motors signal a greener, quieter flight path Airbus group developing electric planes to train pilots by 2017 Company plans to have electric flights for 90 passengers in 15-20 years

CNN —

Imagine taking a peaceful flight, gliding along without much noise or any fuel, effortlessly descending into the airport without a trace of emissions.

Sounds like a dream? It is. But one we can imagine in the not-so-distant future.

E-Fan, the brainchild of parent Airbus Group, is a prototype hybrid electric motor glider which will first be used for training pilots for their license at a school in Bordeaux, France, by 2017.

It debuted with its first public test flight in April 2014, and the two-seater electric aircraft is powered by two batteries, producing 60 kilowatts of power, which will be able to run for half an hour.

The E-Fan has been a continuous journey of evolution, says chief technical officer Jean Botti. “This is a learning curve to get to the big ones in the future.”

This is a learning curve to get to the big ones in the future. Jean Botti, chief technical officer, Airbus Group

It started five years ago when Airbus Group experimented with the Cri-Cri, a tiny plane based on the 1970s Cri-Cri, one of the smallest twin-engine planes in history.

Besides the benefits of noise and emissions reduction, the reduced cost of training pilots with the E-Fan is incredible, says Botti. It costs about two cents per hour to fly the electric plane, a number which is up to 20-50 times cheaper than the normal fuel costs of today’s aircraft, he says.

Ultimately, these savings will get passed on to the customer, explained Botti, as the electric-powered flight training becomes a reality.

What’s ahead for electric?

Eventually, the company has its eye on building planes for regional flights, with up to 90 people flying for three hours, although this is still 15-20 years away, says Botti.

“We’re not talking about replacing the A380,” he says. But the shorter-term goals also include helicopters with hybrid electric technology.

We’re not talking about replacing the A380. Jean Botti, chief technical officer, Airbus Group

For Airbus Group, much of the investment is being mobilized by the European Commission’s “Flightpath 2050” which aims to cut aircraft CO2 emissions by 75%, and noise levels to be reduced by 65% from their 2000 levels.

The goal is to make tens to hundreds of these planes, and Airbus Group says it will be designed by schools with apprenticeship programs in order to help raise up the new engineers of tomorrow.

The biggest challenge for E-Fan is developing new energy storage. “We cannot afford to stay with the state of batteries today. We need to go much higher in terms of efficiency,” says Botti, adding that the company’s new research center in Munich, Germany, will have the capacity to do just that.

Alternative planes take off

It’s not just Airbus looking to alternative aircraft to help save energy, cut fuel consumption and reduce noise.

There are several others developing alternative aircraft with their own success. Recently, the Solar Impulse 2, a fully solar-powered aircraft, was unveiled by a Swiss duo which will attempt to fly non-stop for 120 hours without any fuel next year.

Made of carbon fiber, its predecessor, Solar Impulse, smashed aviation records as it succeeded in the first solar-powered overnight flight, lasting 26 hours in 2010.

Another creation is the Dutch-designed, German-built Antares 23E, an electric aircraft with 23-meter wings which can glide for 60 kilometers (37 miles). The Antares 23E can climb to 3,500 meters on a single battery charge."
Emirates Cancels Major Order From Airbus - The New York Times,"Wed, 11 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTQvMDYvMTIvYnVzaW5lc3MvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9lbWlyYXRlcy1jYW5jZWxzLW1ham9yLW9yZGVyLWZyb20tYWlyYnVzLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Airbus suffered a major blow on Wednesday to its latest commercial jet program after one of its largest customers, Emirates Airline, said it had decided to cancel a multibillion-dollar order for 70 long-range planes.

The news comes just months before the new jet, the A350-XWB, is due to enter service, prompting some analysts to wonder whether the decision by Emirates could presage a slowdown in aircraft orders from Persian Gulf carriers.

Those airlines have been among the most voracious buyers in recent years of wide-body planes from both Airbus and Boeing.

In a statement, Airbus said that Emirates would not take the planes, which had been slated for delivery beginning in 2019."

Aerospace giant Airbus Group and French engine maker Safran announced a joint venture Monday on space launchers, as Europe looks to compete with rising US rival SpaceX.

The two companies said in a statement they would team up on production of Ariane rockets for Arianespace, which is facing intense competition from low-cost SpaceX in sending up communications satellites.

The companies announced the plan after talks in Paris with President Francois Hollande, who hailed the deal as ""a major step toward the consolidation of the European space programme.""

The companies said the deal was aimed at ""further strengthening their relationship to propose a new family of competitive, versatile and efficient space launchers, to serve both commercial and institutional needs.""

It said the 50-50 joint venture would bring together ""expertise in the launcher systems from Airbus Group as well as propulsion systems from Safran.""

""It's all about enhancing the competitiveness of our space launcher business going forward,"" Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders said in the statement.

""The Ariane programme has been hugely successful during the last 30 years, but in order to remain relevant and competitive for the future we need a much more efficient industrial structure.""

Arianespace has dominated the commercial space launch business with its line of Ariane rockets, but newcomer private Space X has begun to shake up the industry with cheaper rockets.

Owned by US billionaire Elon Musk who was behind online payments system PayPal and Tesla electric cars has quickly brought the Falcon rockets that can lift satellites into orbit for $60 million, half the cost of Ariane rockets.

Arianespace's mainstay launcher is the Ariane 5, a heavy rocket that is highly reliable but it has to carry two large satellites to be profitable, and this can cause delays.

France and Germany, the major shareholders in Arianespace, have not been able to agree on strategy for the development of future rockets.

Many analysts say the satellite market is evolving fast towards smaller rockets with single payloads, such as SpaceX's Falcon.

France has supported developing by 2021 the Ariane 6, sketched as a low-cost flexible successor able to place a single payload of three to 6.5 tonnes into a geostationary slot.

ESA also plans to tweak the Ariane 5 with an ME version—for Midlife Evolution—that would be ready by 2017 and yield operational savings over the existing ECA and ES models.

Airbus Seeks New Terms on Data-relay Contract with ESA - SpaceNews,"Fri, 06 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS80MDgxN2FpcmJ1cy1zZWVrcy1uZXctdGVybXMtb24tZGF0YS1yZWxheS1jb250cmFjdC13aXRoLWVzYS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Airbus Defence and Space is asking the European Space Agency to revise the terms of their ambitious public-private partnership on space-based optical data-relay services, saying the risks to the company have grown well beyond what was foreseen in the original contract, European government and industry officials said.

ESA has responded that Airbus knew or should have known the project’s risks when it agreed to a firm, fixed-price commitment in return for managing the European Data Relay Services (EDRS) program, officials said.

“The program is in trouble,” said one industry official whose company has an interest in EDRS’s success. “Airbus is basically saying, ‘We can’t do it under the original terms, there have been too many delays, and our financial exposure is too high.’ ESA’s response has been: ‘You signed a firm contract, and these risks were known at the time.’”

The EDRS program faces delays not only with its own in-orbit data relay payloads but also with the European government satellites that are expected to utilize the network.

ESA has committed about 275 million euros ($358 million) to the EDRS program, with Airbus committing an undisclosed figure that was estimated at less than 70 million euros.

Airbus officials publicly said they are sticking with the program and will work through the current issues.

“EDRS will be realized as planned,” said Evert Dudok, head of Airbus Defence and Space’s Communications, Intelligence and Security division, which manages EDRS. “We are facing delays in some of the system elements, and the Sentinel 1A [Earth observation satellite, carrying an EDRS laser communications terminal] was late in getting to orbit. Also, the European Commission and ESA have needed more time than forecasted to work out the management of the Copernicus program.”

The ESA-European Commission Copernicus environment-monitoring program is EDRS’s anchor customer. Copernicus includes multiple satellite sensors, including at least four satellites carrying EDRS laser communications terminals.

The delay in the start of revenue generation is an issue, Dudok said, but the company expects to be able to exercise options in the EDRS contract with ESA to iron out the current issues.

ESA Director-General Jean-Jacques Dordain said the agency is willing to see Airbus depart as system manager and for EDRS to be run as a conventional government procurement program if that is needed to keep it on track.

Dordain said June 4 that ESA’s belief in the value of EDRS, for disaster response and other uses, has firmed in recent months. “There is a big difference between receiving data a few minutes after it is imaged by a satellite and receiving it hours later,” Dordain said.

Dordain said he understood Airbus’ concerns about program delays and the possibility that the company will not see a return on its investment as soon as originally hoped. He said he did not think Airbus is exaggerating its difficulties as a way of winning better contract terms.

If Airbus cannot expand the EDRS customer base beyond the European Commission and Copernicus, the argument is strengthened for running the program as a conventional government procurement without a private-sector manager seeking an investment return, Dordain said.

Under Dordain’s direction, ESA has made public-private partnerships a showcase feature of the agency’s program development. But all previous public-private partnerships have involved companies taking limited risks in markets that were well developed commercially, or where government demand was foreseeable.

EDRS, which has been strongly backed by the German government, takes public-private partnership risk to another level. There is no commercial market for satellite data relay services.

One point of debate between the 20-nation ESA and Airbus is the amount of capital at risk that Airbus has in EDRS. Industry estimates have been as high as more than 10 million euros ($13.7 million), although government officials have questioned that figure.

Airbus has contracted for the construction of a satellite carrying a laser communications terminal as a secondary payload for a telecommunications mission.

But this satellite, being built by OHB AG of Bremen, Germany, and including a telecommunications payload to be used by Avanti of Britain, is behind schedule and is not expected to be in service before 2016, a year behind the original schedule.

A second EDRS laser communications terminal will be placed aboard a telecommunications satellite under construction for satellite fleet operator Eutelsat of Paris. This satellite, Eutelsat 9B, is under construction by Airbus Defence and Space and was scheduled for launch this year before its launch vehicle, Russia’s Proton rocket, failed in May.

Proton’s return to flight and its ability to work through its manifest this year remain unclear.

EDRS is planned as a global data-relay system to speed data from Earth observation satellites in low Earth orbit to ground managers via satellites in the higher geostationary orbit 36,000 kilometers over the equator.

The idea is to reduce the time from an image’s capture to its exploitation by users to minutes from hours.

One longstanding challenge for Airbus is to turn the current regional EDRS, with two nodes in geostationary orbit, into a global system that would be realized with the construction of a third satellite, preferably covering North America.

Airbus, a successful manufacturer of commercial telecommunications satellites, hopes to find a customer over North America that will agree to permit Airbus to add a laser communications terminal, built by Tesat Spacecom of Backnang, Germany, to an otherwise conventional telecommunications satellite.

With a global network, Airbus would be in a better position to expand EDRS beyond its initial Copernicus market to civil and military markets with unmanned aerial systems equipped with compatible laser communications terminals.

Airbus officials have said the third node is crucial to the long-term financial success of EDRS as a commercial program.

The German Aerospace Center, DLR, which is the principal EDRS backer at ESA and is also an EDRS service supplier to Airbus, declined detailed comment on the program, saying in a statement: “We are working together with ESA and industry to safeguard the program and meet the special challenges of industrial and institutional demands.”

Airbus Innovation Days: A350 Media Test Flight Review - Leeham News and Analysis,"Thu, 12 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNC8wNi8xMi9haXJidXMtaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi1kYXlzLWEzNTAtbWVkaWEtdGVzdC1mbGlnaHQtcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The 150 members of the media received an hour-long ride on A350-900 MSN002 (the “carbon fiber” liveried test plane in the Airbus fleet), a rare event.

Entry into the airplane gave a clean, spacious impression, though the Boeing 787 Sky Interior is more visually impressive. The A350, like the 787, has mood lighting.

What impressed us most, however, was how quiet the A350 is, from engine start-up to taxi to take off to cruise. Several reporters who have been on the Airbus A380—renowned for its quiet cabin—remarked that the A350 is quieter. As we stood at row 1 in the business class, the wind noise was more noticeable than the engines. The A350 is the quietest airplane we’ve been on, and we’ve been flying since 1964.

In this example, the French firm Sogerma supplied the business class seating. B/E Aerospace supplied the galleys and the coach seating, which, of course, had 18-inch wide, nine abreast configuration. Huge overhead bins supply plenty of luggage space.

.

The A350 is equipped with what has become standard on Airbus wide-bodies, a camera mounted in the tail, which was turned on at the gate and throughout the flight.

.

The A350 still has what we call the “Airbus whine” when flaps are extended or retracted.

.

With 200 media and Airbus staff on board and only 30t of fuel, the aircraft had a short runway run, a sharp climbout and quick ascent to our 31,000 ft cruising altitude. During the flight, a French Air Force Rafael fighter came along side to fly formation, an event that naturally caught the attention of the media more than passing over the scenic Pyrenees Mountains in Southern France.

The Airbus A380 won't be flying for Delta Air Lines anytime soon.

That's not a huge surprise, as industry observers have long regarded the superjumbo A380 as a bad fit for the fleet plans at most U.S. carriers. But surprise or not, a Delta executive affirmed that the world's largest passenger jet is not currently being considered by Delta.

""We don't see an application for the A380 in our network,"" Steve Dickson, Delta's SVP for flight operations, is quoted by Reuters as saying Monday at the 2014 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Forum in Atlanta.

Dickson adds four-engine planes — such as the A380 — were ""not viable"" aircraft options for most of Delta's markets, according to Reuters.

""The reliability of the two-engine airplanes and the efficiency of them is just too compelling,"" Dickson says.

Delta has recently put out to aircraft manufacturers a request for proposals for an order of up to 50 wide-body jets. The order would be to replace Delta's aging Boeing 747 and 767 wide-body aircraft, according to Reuters.

In addition to Airbus' A380, Dickson's comments also would seem to indicate that Delta will be cool on the idea of ordering new models of Boeing's 747, also a four-engine aircraft."

The decision cuts the order book for the European company's newest jet, which is due to enter service in around six months' time, by around 10 percent.



Airbus said it followed a ""fleet requirement review"" as Emirates shifts towards the large A380 superjumbo, for which it is the biggest customer.



Emirates was among the first buyers for the A350 rival model to Boeing 's 787 Dreamliner when it placed the order for 50 A350-900 and 20 A350-1000 jets in 2007.



The deal was worth around $16 billion at 2007 list prices - or close to $22 billion based on the current catalogue - although launch customers typically negotiate discounts.

Emirates was due to start taking deliveries of the A350 in 2019. The first A350 is due to be delivered to Qatar Airways in the fourth quarter of this year.

""We are confident that we will sell the (production) slots in the coming months,"" an Airbus spokesman said. ""There's no impact on the program as deliveries were scheduled to start at the end of the decade.""

Airbus shares were down 3.3 pct in early trading in Frankfurt, with the news expected to cast a shadow over two days of briefings for the media at Airbus' headquarters in Toulouse on Wednesday and Thursday.

Emirates has been pushing for Airbus to upgrade the A380 superjumbo with a more efficient engine, after increasing its total orders for the world's biggest passenger jet by 50 in November to 140 planes.

The carrier's chief executive, Tim Clark, said earlier this month that a revamped A380 could have a 10-12 percent performance improvement and that ""we are hoping to move on that pretty soon"".

Emirates is also in the process of firming up an order for 150 of Boeing's latest jetliner, the 777X mini-jumbo, of which Emirates has ordered 150 worth $76 billion at list prices.

Asked about the A350 order cancellation on Wednesday, an Emirates spokesman said: ""The contract which we signed in 2007 for 70 A350 aircraft has lapsed. We are reviewing our fleet requirements.""

Airbus said in a statement that it remained ""very confident"" in the A350 program and that it expected the A350 order book to grow in 2014.

Britain's Rolls-Royce, which is the sole engine maker for the A350, said the Emirates decision would result in a 2.6 billion pound ($4.4 billion) hit to its order book.

""While disappointed with this decision, we are confident that the delivery slots which start towards the end of this decade vacated by Emirates will be taken up by other airlines,"" Rolls-Royce said in a statement."

The Jumbo Jets Boeing and Airbus Turn Into Posh Private Planes - WIRED,"Mon, 16 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS8yMDE0LzA2L3RoZS1qdW1iby1qZXRzLWJvZWluZy1hbmQtYWlyYnVzLXR1cm4taW50by1wb3NoLXByaXZhdGUtcGxhbmVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The $65 million Gulfstream G650 may be the pinnacle of the private jet market, but it just doesn’t do the job for billionaires who prefer to fly with more than a dozen or so passengers.

For that, the uber wealthy turn to Airbus and Boeing, who are more than happy to customize their jets — even the widebodies that can carry hundreds of people — for private use.

Commercial jet manufacturers have been replacing the rows of economy seats in their aircraft with sofas and entertainment centers since the late 1990s. A recent influx of billionaires from Russia, the Middle East, and China has led to a new focus on this part of the business. Since opening the private jet branch in 1997, Airbus has sold over 170 aircraft. Boeing got started in 1996, and has delivered on 195 of 217 total orders received.

The main reason to go with an Airbus A380 or a Boeing 747 over a puny Gulfstream or Bombardier? According a commissioned by Airbus, the wealthiest among us like to travel with family members and business associates. (This, apparently, is particularly true for Middle Eastern oil magnates.)

That’s not to say outfitting a jumbo jet for personal use is always a rational economic decision. For some, the bigger and more luxurious the plane, the better. That’s why Airbus and Boeing don’t just sell their planes, they offer a wide variety of customization options to give customers exactly what they want.

So how much does a personalized widebody plane cost? The manufacturers don’t exactly publish price lists, but we’ve seen figures between $300 million for an A380.

Here’s a look at what’s available for billionaires ready to spend that big a pile of dough."
India's PSLV Rocket Lofts Airbus Spot 7 Satellite - SpaceNews,"Mon, 30 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS80MTA3MGluZGlhcy1wc2x2LXJvY2tldC1sb2Z0cy1haXJidXMtc3BvdC03LXNhdGVsbGl0ZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BANGALORE, India — India’s PSLV rocket successfully placed Airbus’ Spot 7 commercial Earth observation satellite into Orbit June 30 along with four smaller satellites belonging to Germany, Canada and Singapore.

Spot 7 separated from the rocket 18 minutes after launch and went into a 660-kilometer orbit; the other four satellites were deployed over the next two minutes, according to the Indian Space Research Organisation.

India’s new prime minister, Narendra Modi, described the nationally televised launch as a “global endorsement of India’s space capability.” The launch took place from Satish Dhawan Space Centre in southeastern India at 9:52 a.m. local time — three minutes later than scheduled to avoid a potential collision with space debris.

During his remarks, Modi called upon ISRO to launch a dedicated satellite that “provides a full range of applications to all [South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation] members” — Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka and Afghanistan.

Modi, a Hindu Nationalist sworn in as prime minister in May, described India’s space program as “the most cost effective in the world,” challenging ISRO to “fully harness space technology for governance and development.”

“We must keep enhancing our capability in all areas of space technology and build heavier satellites and new launch infrastructure,” Modi said.

The 714-kilogram Spot 7 satellite built by Europe’s Airbus Defence and Space was the main passenger on PSLV’s latest flight. The co-passengers were the German Aerospace Center’s 14-kilogram AISat-1; a pair of identical Canadian Advanced Nanospace eXperimental satellites — CanX-4 and CanX-5 — each weighing 15 kilograms and built by the Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies’ Space Flight Laboratory; and Singapore’s 7-kilogram Velox-1 satellite designed and built by students of Nanyang Technological University.

ISRO said all five satellites were launched under commercial contracts brokered by Antrix, ISRO’s commercial arm. Financial terms were not disclosed.

Spot 7, designed to last 10 years, joins the Spot 6 satellite placed into orbit by a PSLV in September 2012. Airbus Defence and Space said in a statement that the successful launch of Spot 7 completed its constellation of high-resolution Earth imaging satellites. In addition to the Spot satellites, Airbus also has exclusive commercial use of the French civil-military Pleiades 1A and Pleiades 1B satellites flying in the same orbit.

Germany’s AISat-1 microsatellite carries an experimental Automatic Identification System sensor for tracking maritime assets. CanX-4 and CanX-5 are expected to demonstrate “on-orbit formation flying” while Singapore’s student-built Velox-1 will collect and transmit Earth imagery."

PARIS (AP) - Emirates Airlines has cancelled its order for 70 Airbus A350 aircraft, a blow to the European manufacturer.

The A350 is intended as Airbus' best hope for catching up in the long-haul market that is dominated by Boeing's 777 and 787 but has been plagued by years of delays and a multi-billion dollar revamp.

In Wednesday's announcement, the companies said Emirates cancelled the order after a ""fleet requirement"" review. The carrier is owned by the government of Dubai and is by far the largest in the Mideast.

Emirates has been rapidly adding the Boeing 777 to its fleet, and last year placed an order for 150 of the planned 777x model in a deal valued at $55.6 billion."
The World's Silliest Plane Takes Off for a 'Once-in-a-Lifetime' Stunt - WIRED,"Mon, 02 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS8yMDE0LzA2L2FpcmJ1cy1iZWx1Z2Ev0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The coolest planes in all of France have flown in formation together, and we couldn't be happier about it.

On Friday May 30, fighter jets with the country's top (only?) aerobatic flying team took to the skies over Toulouse alongside the Airbus Beluga, the funky cargo plane we love more every time we see it.

Airbus developed the Beluga, known by the more serious among us as the A300-600ST Super Transporter, in the 1990s to carry wings and fuselages between assembly plants. Derived from the A300, the plane looks more like its namesake cetacean or the alien supervillain Megamind than something that can get off the ground, let alone keep up with eight of the blue, white, and red Alphajets of the Armée de l'Air.

The Beluga is 56 feet tall with a cavernous cargo hold. The cargo deck covers 1,400 square meters, more than an Olympic-size swimming pool. The plane's max takeoff weight is more than 340,000 pounds, and its two--just two--General Electric turbofan engines can propel it to 625 mph. There are just five of these behemoths in the world, and they're all used by Airbus to shuttle parts or for the occasional charter flight like, say, carrying Eugene Delacroix's enormous painting Liberty Leading the People from Paris to Tokyo in 1999.

The Dassault/Dornier Alphajet is used by French pilots in training, as well as by the Patrouille de France, the French Air Force's demonstration flying team. It's just 14 feet tall and its max takeoff weight is under 16,000 pounds.

Airbus called the joint appearance, part of the 2014 Airexpo air show in southwest France, a ""one-in-a-lifetime flight."" That's a real bummer, because we'd love to see these jets team up again."
"Airbus and Safran Propose New Ariane 6 Design, Reorganization of Europe's Rocket Industry - SpaceNews","Fri, 20 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS80MDk3M2FpcmJ1cy1hbmQtc2FmcmFuLXByb3Bvc2UtbmV3LWFyaWFuZS02LWRlc2lnbi1yZW9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbi1vZi1ldXJvcGVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SINGAPORE — European space-hardware builders Airbus and Safran have proposed that the French and European space agencies scrap much of their previous 18 months’ work on a next-generation Ariane 6 rocket in favor of a design that includes much more liquid propulsion.

The two companies further said they will merge their rocket divisions into a single joint-venture entity that would expand to take over Ariane production and sales.

The proposal, which has the apparent backing of the French government and which one European government official said would detonate a “Big Bang” in Europe’s rocket sector, has forced its way onto the agenda of the European Space Agency, which has agreed to review it July 16, according to European government officials.

Airbus and Safran’s surprise move came June 16 during a ceremony at France’s Elysee Palace in the presence of French President Francois Hollande.

The joint venture, split 50-50 between Airbus and Safran, means Airbus would no longer be prime contractor for Europe’s Ariane rocket. The role would be assumed by the new company. Airbus and Safran together hold about 43 percent of the equity in Evry, France-based Arianespace, which currently markets and operates Ariane vehicles. The companies propose to purchase the 35 percent Arianespace share held by the French space agency, CNES.

Followed to its logical end, the proposal means Europe’s launch vehicle development would become a private-sector affair based on performance requirements given by the government and the commercial sectors. Whether CNES or ESA would need to retain a launcher division is an open question. Government agencies, too, are being asked to reduce their rocket-related expenses.

Changes are afoot for Arianespace as well. The company’s chief executive, Stephane Israel, briefing journalists July 17 here, said his company is well aware that it cannot escape a restructuring as part of the broader reorganization of the launcher sector.

ESA, CNES, Germany’s DLR space agency and others have said the design of a new Ariane 6 rocket, and approval of an upgraded Ariane 5, should be used as occasions to reorganize Europe’s rocket industry so that it can better compete by lowering costs. Implicit in this is an acknowledgement that the 12,000-odd workforce building Ariane vehicles would be cut approximately in half.

“It’s all about enhancing the competitiveness of our space launcher business going forward,” Airbus Group Chief Executive Tom Enders said in a June 16 statement. “Our agreement with Safran is the starting point of an exciting journey towards a more integrated, more efficient and hence more profitable launcher business in Europe.”

French government officials said the last time a French president held an audience with the launch vehicle sector was in the early 1970s. Following the photo session, Hollande’s office issued a statement congratulating Airbus and Safran on their joint-venture decision, but also saying the space sector counts 16,000 jobs in France alone.

The two companies are asking that ESA governments, scheduled to meet in December, confirm their commitment to finishing work on an upgraded Ariane 5 rocket to give the vehicle a restartable upper stage and more payload-carrying power. The upgrade is intended to permit Ariane 5 to better compete with Space Exploration Technologies Corp. of the United States for lighter satellites, and with Russia’s Proton rocket for heavier satellites.

The upgraded Ariane, called Ariane 5 ME, would continue the current Ariane 5 business model of launching two telecommunications satellites at a time into geostationary transfer orbit. If the remaining upgrade work is funded by ESA governments in December, at a cost of about 1.2 billion euros ($1.6 billion), Ariane 5 ME could be in service starting in 2018.

ESA governments, under heavy pressure from France, in November 2012 agreed to start early work on a next-generation Ariane 6 rocket in parallel with Ariane 5 ME, with both vehicles sharing the restartable Vinci upper stage.

As agreed to by ESA and CNES, the Ariane 6 design being studied for the past 18 months featured solid-fueled first and second stages, the Vinci liquid-fueled upper stage and two strap-on solid-rocket boosters that would be virtually identical to the first and second stages.

The economies of scale in building so many identical solid-fueled stages was key to the design-to-cost approach to create a rocket that would reach the ESA-mandated price point of 70 million euros per launch.

But that vehicle never won endorsement from Germany, whose industry had focused on liquid-fueled technology and whose government never liked the lack of modularity in the Ariane 6 vehicle.

The solid-fueled Ariane 6 drew heavily on French and Italian specialties. But with France intending to pay no more than 50 percent of the development costs, questions were raised as to Italy’s ability to fund its sizable share.

Germany was not alone in voicing concerns about the design. Commercial satellite fleet operators — whose business is indispensable to the financial viability of Arianespace — said an Ariane 6 with a maximum payload capacity of 6,500 kilograms would be unable to launch two 3,500-to-4,000-kilogram satellites at a time when such pairings were available. That would make the vehicle less competitive, these satellite operators said in a letter to ESA.

ESA had turned aside these critiques in recent months, saying all alternatives to the mainly solid-fueled design had been studied, and none met the ESA test for acceptability — 70 million euros to launch, a development cost as low as possible, and a service introduction of around 2020.

Government and industry officials said the Airbus/Safran proposal features two Ariane 6 designs. This would replace the current Ariane 5 and the Europeanized Russian Soyuz rocket that now launches more European government satellites than does the heavy-lift Ariane 5 because the satellites are better suited to a midrange rocket.

One Ariane 6 would launch payloads weighing between 3,000 and 7,000 kilograms into orbit, with the focus on the European government market. The other would have a lift capacity of up to 8,500 kilograms and would be used for commercial launches, both single- and dual-launch versions.

The announcement appeared to catch ESA off guard. The agency has been saying for months that only one Ariane 6 version was on the table. Then, in mid-May, France’s space minister, Genevieve Fioraso, told reporters in Berlin that France was willing to consider alternative designs if they met the cost and schedule requirements.

The new design makes it much more likely that Ariane 6 will receive major financial backing from Germany, even if France retains responsibility for about 50 percent of the total development package.

Johann-Dietrich Woerner, chairman of DLR’s executive board, issued a measured statement June 17, saying industry consolidation “can help to achieve our objectives.”

ESA Director-General Jean-Jacques Dordain said in a statement that he welcomed the joint-venture proposal as a first step toward industry consolidation. As to the new Ariane 6 design, Dordain said it would be evaluated alongside the original design as ESA moves toward its December ministerial conference for final decisions.

CNES President Jean-Yves Le Gall, in a June 17 interview, said he has no problems, in principle, with a new Ariane 6 design, so long as it meets the development cost, production cost, and in-service-schedule requirements set by CNES and ESA.

“When I first arrived at CNES I didn’t like the [solid-fueled] Ariane 6 design,” Le Gall said. “But it turned out to be the only one that met the criteria that had been set.”

Le Gall said the two companies’ proposal to scrap the idea of a new launch pad for Ariane 6 — estimated price: 750 million euros — is a good idea that had already been incorporated into the latest iteration of the solid-fueled Ariane 6 design.

Whether the new version proposed by the two companies can be produced and launched for 70 million euros is a big question that has not been answered, Le Gall said. Also unknown is whether its development will cost more than the estimated 3.25 billion euros for the earlier Ariane 6 design.

Other questions remain. Will the French government accept a rocket design that cuts France’s launch vehicle employment by 50 percent or more? One French industry official said all have agreed that this will happen in the decade between now and the arrival of the Ariane 6, but that no interest is served in headlining the fact.

“If you start a debate by saying there will be blood everywhere, the idea won’t go far,” this official said. “But we all know what the end result is.”

Le Gall had said Europe’s network of 20-plus Ariane integration sites needs to be cut to perhaps three — one each in France, Germany and Italy. Italy’s role in solid-rocket production with the Italian-led Vega small-satellite launcher had been one argument for the earlier Ariane 6 design. The Airbus-Safran announcement is silent on which sites would be kept, and which would be closed.

Similarly, the two companies are still not clear about whether the Ariane 5 ME will be able to survive without the annual 100 million euros in price supports that allow Arianespace to balance its books. Government officials have said previous industry commitments on this point have been riddled with conditions that make the commitment less serious."
Flying First Class on an Emirates Airbus A380 - Vanity Fair,"Wed, 18 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbml0eWZhaXIuY29tL25ld3MvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAxNC8wNy9kdWJhaS1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLWFpcnBvcnQtZW1pcmF0ZXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzODDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Four Tectonic Shifts

The emergence of these carriers marks the fourth tectonic shift in international aviation since Pan Am’s founder, Juan Trippe, democratized the industry in the early 1950s. Prior to Trippe’s intervention, air travel was the domain of the ruling classes, and fares between the U.S. and Europe were fixed by the stodgy International Air Transport Association. However, in 1952, Trippe decided to introduce a tourist-class fare between New York and London and thus began a decades-long battle between free-market flying and cartel-led regulation that would see the rise and fall of carriers such as Sir Freddie Laker’s Skytrain in the 70s and People Express in the 80s, along with the breakout success of Virgin Atlantic.

The second shift came with the arrival of the jet age, in 1958, the introduction of the Boeing 747 a little over a decade later, and then the 1978 deregulation of the U.S. airline industry. In the early days of mass air travel, national airlines such as Pan Am and TWA and flag-carrying European airlines (British Airways, Air France, Lufthansa) ruled the world through government-protected colonial-route networks. But as the colonies evaporated and new business models challenged regulation, the legacy U.S. behemoths began to fall. First Eastern, then Pan Am, then TWA.

Southeast Asia then heralded the third tectonic shift. Introducing high-quality, service-led air travel, airlines such as Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines, Thai, and the rest all flourished as the international business-travel market grew, and as the old-world airlines struggled to survive. These fleets provided more comfortable seating, particularly at the front of the cabins, and a level of in-flight service that Western airlines had failed to offer with any conviction since the 50s.

Now we are in the fourth age. U.S. airlines are merging and morphing into giant entities with large domestic networks and relatively small international reach, offering only passable amenities on rather old equipment. Meanwhile, the Gulf airlines feature quality service at a competitive price. Peter Morris, chief economist at the aviation consultancy firm Ascend, says that these carriers have now “built enough critical mass to be a genuine threat to the traditional European airlines and in the near future to the Americans.”

Shanghai on Steroids

‘They say that Dubai is Shanghai on steroids,” notes Clark as he stares out of his office window in the terminal, admiring a row of gleaming Emirates A380s. A neat, dapper man in his 60s, Clark reveals that his first job (after graduating with an economics degree from the University of London) was as a bus conductor. That humble beginning, he says, taught him the basics of the transport trade “because right from the start I was intrigued at the pricing structure and the type of bus fleet, and saw great similarities when I joined the airline industry.” He subsequently spent 14 years in aviation before moving to Dubai.

Emirates has 47 A380s in service and another 93 ordered, but the challenge of filling these giant aircraft as the world slowly emerges from the global recession doesn’t faze Clark at all. He says 93 is nowhere near enough for Emirates’ needs, and then his eyes light up at the thought of all the potential customers out there in the modern world. “Look at China,” he exclaims. “The Chinese market is big enough for all of us. There are cities we haven’t heard of—with populations half the size of Britain—and they’ve got three international flights a week.”

The only time that Clark seems to lose his air of affability is when criticism of Emirates is raised by the “legacy” airlines. He says that for years the leaders of these European and North American carriers have benefited from subsidies and tax advantages on fuel and had received export aid for new aircraft from Boeing and Airbus for which their domestic counterparts were ineligible. In any case, pleas to keep the trio of Gulf airlines out of Europe and North America have failed, and all three, over the past few years, have significantly increased service to European cities.

“The Europeans accuse us of stealing their market,” Clark says, fairly agitated. “But it wasn’t theirs in the first place. What right have they to take passengers from Africa to Asia or vice versa over European hubs? So a passenger who wants to go from Abidjan, the Ivory Coast, to Shanghai belongs to the European airlines? How can they claim that? The point here is that the number of people traveling between Shanghai and Côte d’Ivoire in the old days was probably five a week. Now it’s 5,000.

“The Americans,” he continues, “are similar to the Europeans in their archaic labor practices and processes and in the way companies are engineered internally. Some are trying to pull themselves into the 21st century. But we got there first.”

Bridging the Gulf

Eighty miles across the barren desert in Abu Dhabi is Clark’s opposite number, James Hogan, an Australian who for the past seven years has been the president and C.E.O. of Etihad. He oversees a kind of boutique version of the Dubai airline, with similarly excellent in-flight service, food and drink, and touch-screen digital entertainment. Etihad also has serious designs on the American market. The airline already runs daily flights between Abu Dhabi and New York, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. It has just started a similar L.A. service, and plans a Dallas route later this year.

Hogan is a more abrasive version of Emirates’ Clark, although his start in the travel industry was as humble as his rival’s: he was a check-in clerk working for Ansett Airlines in his native Australia and, like Clark, learned something about dealing with difficult airline passengers. He says he sees the future as the battle of the hubs—the Asian hubs, the European hubs, and, in the near future, the Chinese and Indian hubs. “One could call it the Old Silk Road being re-invented,” he says.

“Just look at India. There are some 300 million middle-class people there who are traveling, and the links, say, between India and America are strong. A lot of kids in these regions go to American universities, there are more American multi-nationals in the region, and the next opportunity is leisure travel.”

A number of frequent fliers I’ve spoken to say they prefer Etihad to Emirates because it has a more personal, intimate feel. As I board an Etihad Boeing 777 on the Abu Dhabi-London route I can barely tell the difference. Their flight crews, according to Hogan, come from 120 nations. Their average age is 26. The comfortable seats—all with digital entertainment systems—have 34-inch pitch in economy, 73 inches in business, and 80 inches in first, the latter classes offering lie-flat beds. The mood, even as we prepare for takeoff, is one of glamour and buoyancy. In a way, it reminds me of Virgin Atlantic in its youthful heyday, when the journey was an exhilarating part of the experience rather than a dread necessity.

There are many reasons for this spectacular rise of the Middle East airlines, but the impetus, above all, comes from the region’s political leaders’ putting their oil wealth to good use. Willie Walsh, C.E.O. of Europe’s International Airlines Group, looks on enviously from his offices at London’s Heathrow and says with barely concealed anger that “their governments recognize that airlines are a facilitator of economic development and growth. Whereas here [in the West], governments, through lack of commitment, vision, or policy, have seen air transport stagnate.”

And when the oil dries up? That really is the point of this supercharged growth spurt. While Dubai, in 2001, ranked 99th in international air traffic, it now ranks first. Whereas Emirati aviation, in the 90s, was a fledgling industry, today it represents 30 percent of Dubai’s G.D.P. This is a business that was certainly founded on a tidal wave of petrodollars. But now it has a life of its own. And, for the time being, all those flush travelers filling all those plush cabins seem increasingly grateful."
"Lufthansa's 12th Airbus A380 is baptized ""Hamburg"" - Runway Girl Network","Sat, 07 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTQvMDYvbHVmdGhhbnNhcy0xMnRoLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLWlzLWJhcHRpemVkLWhhbWJ1cmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On Thursday, 5 June, I was lucky enough to be among the crowd at Hamburg Airport waiting breathlessly for it to arrive. As it approached the runway, perhaps due to its enormous size, it appeared to be moving in a graceful slow motion. Then Lufthansa’s newest baby, the airline’s 12th A380, touched down expertly a few minutes after 1:00 pm local time, while more than a hundred special guests pressed their noses and cameras against the glass at a cordoned-off section of Terminal 2.

An A380 can always draw a crowd, but this one is very special. You see, Lufthansa has a policy of naming its airplanes after cities – and this extraordinary bird was about to be officially named for the place in which it was completed, the heart of the aviation industry in Germany, the city Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg. And as the double jetways extended towards her port and starboard sides before us, the cockpit window slid open and out of it was thrust a large red flag bearing the crest of the city.

On hand for this special occasion was a congregation of local media, senior representatives from Lufthansa, Hamburg Airport and Airbus, plus a large assortment of friends and other key individuals. The feeling in the air was one of patriotism and pride, not to mention the electric tingle of genuine excitement as the clock ticked closer the 3:30 pm departure time for our roundabout flight (the first on an A380 for many of us).

“The aviation industry is one of the major growth drivers and employers in our city. The high order volumes from Airbus here make for a long lasting job security, with many positive effects in other areas,” said Hamburg Mayor Olaf Scholz just moments before baptising the colossal bird with a bottle of good Champagne. “This A380 will be an excellent ambassador for the city of Hamburg, and not least because it underlines our claim to represent one of the world’s largest aviation centers.”

In the crowd I found Florian Siedel, Head of Communications at Airbus Germany. He told me that this particular aircraft left Airbus’s Hamburg completion centre about three weeks ago. Lufthansa then took her straight to Frankfurt, the airline’s main hub. Since then, it has already carried a number of passengers between Frankfurt and Lufthansa’s A380 destinations of Beijing, Singapore, Shanghai, New York, Houston, Miami, San Francisco and Johannesburg.

Like everyone else present, he was thrilled to be part of the celebrations. “For the community and also the wider public, it’s great to have such a big aircraft – the flagship of Lufthansa and the flagship of Airbus – flying with the name Hamburg. Most of the Hamburgers you could ask would be very proud of it,” he said. “For us it is the same thing. Hamburg is very much like Toulouse. It is our most important production site in one of the core countries of Airbus. It’s just fitting to have an A380 called Hamburg.”

Later, on the all-Business Class top deck of the surprisingly quiet machine, I enjoyed a glass of very nice wine (life was just beautiful that day) and resisted a profound urge to play with my electronic seat controls as I chatted with Aage Duenhaupt, Director of Group Communications for Lufthansa.

“Hamburg is the heart of Lufthansa in a certain way. Especially when you look back and discover that after the Second World War, on the first of April 1955, the first ever Lufthansa flight took off from Hamburg. We also have a very big maintenance operation in Hamburg with Lufthansa Technik, so it is a special moment for us,” he told me, adding that Hamburg is not the only place to have received its namesake A380 with such fanfare. “I have been on a couple of these events and the good thing is that there are many other cities in Germany, as well as German states, which are as proud as we from Lufthansa to take the names.”

Fun facts about A380

To date, Airbus has completed 132 A380s in Hamburg. Around half of them have been delivered from Hamburg and the other half from Toulouse, but all had their cabin installed and were painted in Hamburg.

324 A380s have been ordered to date. Lufthansa has ordered 14.

The “Hamburg” is the 12th A380 that Lufthansa has received. Number 11 was delivered earlier this year and is named for the German city of Düsseldorf.

The next A380 to be delivered will most likely be an Emirates plane, and the one after that will be their 50th A380.

Asiana became the 11th A380 operator 2 weeks ago.

The next airlines to become new A380 operators are Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways, and Skymark (from Japan). All will take delivery this year.

Airbus Helicopters X3 makes its new home at France's national Air and Space museum - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 19 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1c2hlbGljb3B0ZXJzeDNtYWtlc2l0c25ld2hvbWVhdGZyYW5jZXNuYXRpb25hbGFpcmFuZHNwYS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After opening the frontiers of flight during a record-setting test program, Airbus Helicopters’ X3 is now ready for its place in history as this high-speed helicopter demonstrator is welcomed for display at the French national musée de l’Air et de l’Espace (Air and Space museum) of Paris-Le Bourget.

The X3 will be exhibited in the musée de l’Air et de l’Espace’s hangar facilities at Paris-Le Bourget airport, being strategically located with other high-speed legends – Europe’s supersonic Concorde jetliners.

“We welcome this illustrious addition to France’s leading aviation museum, where our collection includes other historic rotorcraft from Airbus Helicopters’ lineage – like the S.A. 3210-01 Super Frelon, which 50 years earlier set a world speed record of 350 km/hr,” explained Catherine Maunoury, CEO of the musée de l’Air et de l’Espace and twice world aerobatics champion. “The X3 continues a tradition of excellence at Airbus Helicopters, building on decades of innovation, research and development.”

Airbus Helicopters pursued the X3 development as part of self-funded company efforts to evolve rotorcraft that offer new ways to perform missions, fly faster and farther, and reduce operating and maintenance costs. The X3, known as a hybrid helicopter, demonstrated the company’s high- speed, long-range, Hybrid Helicopter (H3) concept.

“It is appropriate that the X3 is joining other renowned aircraft at the Musée de l’Air et de l’Espace that have helped shape the aviation industry, especially since from its conception, it showed Airbus Helicopters’ entrepreneurial drive to deliver a viable demonstrator to serve our customers’ high- speed requirements,” said Airbus Helicopters Executive Vice President Global Business & Services, Dominique Maudet.

From its maiden take-off in September 2010 to its retirement in 2013, the X3 fully validated Airbus Helicopters’ hybrid concept, using a pair of turboshaft engines to power both a five-blade helicopter main rotor and two propellers installed on short-span fixed wings.

During more than 155 hours logged by the aircraft in 199 flights, milestones achieved included a level flight speed of 255 knots (472 km/hr) on June 7, 2013 – surpassing previous high speeds reached by a helicopter. While exploring the full flight envelope in cruise, climb, at altitude and during descent, the X3 validated this high-speed concept’s qualities – including outstanding stability, intuitive piloting characteristics, as well as low vibration levels without the need for anti-vibration systems.

The X3 also served as an ambassador of innovation during a demo tour in the U.S. in the summer of 2012 to demonstrate this advanced high-speed transportation system’s unique operational capabilities for both civil and military operators. The final stop at Washington D.C., where the X3 landed on the helipad of the Pentagon, marked a symbolic moment in the X3‘s frontier-pushing history. Three months later, the X3 was in the spotlight at the ILA Berlin air show where it participated in flight demonstrations and gave European aficionados an up-close look at its unique characteristics.

Airbus Helicopters foresees a wide range of potential applications for a hybrid helicopter configuration that may be developed from the X3 concept, offering an advanced, cost-effective vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) transportation system with speeds of a turboprop-powered aircraft and the full-flight capabilities of a helicopter. Its applications could include long-distance search and rescue (SAR) operations, coast guard missions, border patrol flights, passenger transport and off-shore airlift, along with inter-city shuttle services.

The combination of higher cruise speeds and excellent VTOL performance also is well-suited for military missions, such as special forces operations, troop transport, combat SAR and medical evacuation. The X3 concept is particularly well suited for missions requiring long transit flights at high speeds, while retaining full vertical lift and hover capabilities – all at a very affordable cost.

The X3 resulted from a rapid-paced program that utilized one of Airbus Helicopters’ Dauphin helicopters as the airframe, providing a test platform with a maximum take-off weight of 5,200 kg. In addition to the more symbolic aspect of achieving record velocities for a rotorcraft, the X3’s flight evaluations enabled Airbus Helicopters to further explore the behavior of main rotors at high speeds, while also assessing the effectiveness in drag optimization."

Aerial Power Lines pioneers aerial power grid services in Malaysia with Airbus Helicopters - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 26 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FlcmlhbHBvd2VybGluZXNwaW9uZWVyc2FlcmlhbHBvd2VyZ3JpZHNlcnZpY2VzaW5tYWxheXNpYXdpdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The delivery of Airbus Helicopters’ initial two rotorcraft to Aerial Power Lines Sdn Bhd (APL) will enable this Malaysian operator to offer competitive solutions for electrical power line construction, maintenance and surveillance – furthering the country’s evolution as a developed nation.

Provided to APL during a ceremony at the Airbus Helicopters Malaysia subsidiary in Subang, were an AS350 B3e and EC135 T2e, which are the evolved versions of the manufacturer’s workhorse single-engine AS350 Ecureuil family and its popular twin-engine EC135 product line.

APL is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sarawak Cable Berhad (SCABLE), and the only company approved by the Department of Civil Aviation Malaysia to perform aerial power line operations in the country.

In developing its services plan, APL implemented a strategic alignment with Airbus Helicopters and the French national electrical grid operator, Réseau de Transport d’Électricité (RTE). This enables the Malaysian company to benefit from its two partners’ extensive expertise in aerial power line development, monitoring and maintenance – upholding the operational and safety standards that are benchmarked by both the European Aviation Safety Agency and the Department of Civil Aviation Malaysia airworthiness authorities.

“Our aerial power line solutions represent a well thought-out business strategy, applying tested technologies and procedures from RTE and Airbus Helicopters in France that have been used and improved by them for the past 40 years,“ explained Dato Sri Mahmud Abu Bekir Taib, the Chairman of Sarawak Cable. “We believe the introduction of such solutions will add to the impetus of Malaysia becoming a fully-developed nation by the year 2020.”

In addition to the AS350 B3e and EC135 T2e provided today, APL will take delivery of an EC225 in mid-2015. The operator has a full maintenance contract with Airbus Helicopters, and also is receiving training from the manufacturer. Additionally, APL’s rotorcraft will be hangared at Airbus Helicopters Malaysia’s facility which is located in the Malaysian International Aerospace Centre in Subang.

“We welcome APL as a new customer, which can count on Airbus Helicopters’ full commitment in providing the complete spectrum of support and services to ensure their successful foray into a brand new market segment in Malaysia,” said Pierre Rossignol, managing director of Airbus Helicopters Malaysia.

“We are honored to be APL’s selected partner in pioneering the use of helicopters for power grid management and operations in this part of the world, where we foresee significant potential for its expansion across Malaysia and within the region,” he added.

The helicopters selected by APL cover the light- and heavy-weight segments of Airbus Helicopters’ product line, thus enabling them to carry out a wide range of power line missions. Its AS350 B3e is the high-performance member of the Ecureuil light helicopter family. With its proven performance in hot conditions and at very high altitudes, this helicopter type is often used for power line inspections.

The evolved twin-engine EC135 T2e has a maximum takeoff weight increased up to 2.95 metric tons, offering a 40-kg. gain in payload and allowing an extra passenger to be carried with a load margin extension. It is widely used for visits to power lines, aerial construction and maintenance. In the 11-ton category, the EC225 integrates the latest technological innovations for more power, increased payload and longer range, and is suited for a wide variety of services, such as maintenance and construction work on overhead electrical power lines and airlift support at major infrastructure projects."

Demag cranes chosen for Airbus US assembly line - Aerospace Manufacturing,"Fri, 27 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm8tbWFnLmNvbS9kZW1hZy1jcmFuZXMtY2hvc2VuLWZvci1haXJidXMtdXMtYXNzZW1ibHktbGluZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

Ten process cranes will be employed for the final assembly of A320 Family aircraft in three production hangars. Measuring up to 66.5m in length and offering maximum load capacities of some 25 tonnes, the process cranes feature up to four suspensions for safe and precise handling of sensitive aircraft components. Lutz Dowy, vice-president global product management & process cranes at Terex Material Handling, explained: “We supply crane systems that are tailored to meet the demands of aircraft logistics and assembly operations. We are providing Airbus with a strong crane concept for a continuous intralogistic solution.” John Paxton, vice-president and general manager of Terex Material Handling North America, stated: “Our unique local US capability to deliver complex solutions coupled with proven worldwide successes with similar Airbus projects were key factors to winning this order. We are very pleased that Airbus chose Terex Material Handling North America to be their partner on this critical project.” The heart of the new Airbus plant is the 255m long Final Assembly Line hangar, where five process cranes will operate in a series of three assembly zones. In zone 1, three cranes will be installed for transporting fuselages for the fuselage assembly operation. Featuring quadruple suspension arrangements, the double-girder suspension cranes have a total length of 66.5m and travel on a common crane runway. Installed on each of the crane girders is a main trolley, which accommodates four Demag 6.3t hoist units that operate on two traversing bridges. Thanks to the precise control of 12 motion axes per crane, Airbus will be able to position the individual fuselage sections that measure 3.96m in diameter with an extremely high level of accuracy. To ensure that the fuselage segments are gently picked up, the cranes will be equipped with a semi-automatic rope tensioning system. Once the four hoist units have each lifted a specified load of 300kg, they continue to lift the suspended payload in a synchronised motion to avoid any flexing of the sensitive aircraft components. After all fuselage segments have been assembled, the cranes transport the complete fuselage to the next assembly station. To do this, both process cranes and their eight hoist units operate under synchronised control. In zone two, two wing-handling cranes will be responsible for the lifting motions during the wing assembly process. Both process cranes are each equipped with two traversing bridges with a total of three 3.2t hoist units, which pick up the waiting wings and position them precisely as required for the assembly operation. Finally, in zone three, an assembly crane with a 5t Demag standard-headroom traveling hoist unit will be used for the assembly of the tail units and handling other components. Two identical Demag process cranes of single-girder design also will be used in the final phase hangar. These cranes feature multiple suspensions and each operates on four crane runways that are arranged parallel to each other. With a length of 40m and a load capacity of 5t, these crane installations are designed for transporting the components swiftly to where they are needed for installation on the aircraft. The individual parts of the aircraft, such as the fuselage, wings and tail unit, are pre-assembled at locations throughout Airbus' European production network and will be transported to the transhipment hangar in Mobile. Two single-girder suspension cranes, each equipped with two 7.5t Demag hoist units, operate in this hangar, which is upstream of the assembly process. The cranes are employed as stand-alone units as well as in tandem mode for handling the incoming aircraft components. Monitoring systems provide for synchronized lifting and transport motions with up to four hoist units to ensure that even large and bulky assemblies are handled safely and reliably. www.terex.com"

This milestone aircraft’s handover occurred at the new rotary-wing center of excellence operated by Airbus Helicopters’ Helibras subsidiary at Itajubá in Minas Gerais state.

Representing a €160 million investment, the facility includes the EC725‘s final assembly line, test benches, a paint facility, training resources and a state of the art engineering center.

“The delivery is another key achievement in a program that remains on schedule and within the contractual budget, underscoring the dedication of all partners to its success,” said Airbus Helicopters CEO Guillaume Faury. “It also highlights our long-term commitment to dual goal of enhancing Brazil’s heli-lift capabilities while developing a world-class rotorcraft industry in the country.”

Brazil’s armed forces have received a total of 12 EC725s to date, with the previous 11 helicopters either supplied from Airbus Helicopters’ production site in France or partially assembled at Helibras’ Itajubá facility. With this latest delivery, the Brazilian Navy now has three EC725s in its inventory, while another five are operated by the Air Force, and four by the Army.

These helicopters have logged a combined total of 5,000 flight hours with the three military services.

The milestone rotorcraft provided to the Brazilian Navy went through its complete assembly at Itajubá – including the integration of mission equipment, flight line activities and industrial acceptance.

“The cooperation between France and Brazil gave rise to extraordinary results” said Eduardo Marson, CEO of Helibras. “The helicopter was assembled on-site by highly committed Brazilian and French teams, who contributed to the success of another milestone in the transfer of technology and in nationalizing the EC725’s production”.

As part of developing an in-country supply chain for the EC725, Helibras already has signed contracts with 16 Brazilian companies for the supply of components, parts and services. Ultimately, EC725s supplied to the Brazilian armed forces will have 50 percent domestic content.

The EC725 is Airbus Helicopter’s latest member of its Super Puma/Cougar helicopter family. As a highly capable twin-engine helicopter in the 11-metric-ton category, it is designed for multiple missions, including combat search and rescue, long-range tactical transport, aeromedical transport, logistic support and naval duties."

Yesterday, I explained that I am in Toulouse attending Airbus’ annual innovation event to brief journalists from around the world.

This morning, as some 150 reporters gathered at the Airbus delivery center, we were greeted by the A350 XWB test aircraft MSN002, which was parked right outside the building. And we were informed that we would be taking a one-hour flight on the aircraft.

We boarded the aircraft – which has an almost complete cabin interior with a four-across business cabin and nine-across economy cabin.

With Airbus chief test pilot Peter Chandler and A350 project test pilot Frank Chapman at the helm, we took off from Toulouse Blagnac Airport at 10.45am and with a takeoff weight of 192 tonnes.

During the one-hour flight, the aircraft climbed to a cruise altitude of 31,000 feet, flying over the Pyrenees mountains on a beautiful summer day, and was visited at one point by a French Air Force Dassault Rafale fighter jet. Enroute back to Toulouse, they turned on the cabin mood lighting.

My impressions? Very quiet on takeoff, through climb and at cruise. A distinctly spacious-feeling cabin that feels very much like flying on an A380. This is going to be a highly comfortable aircraft that will provide airlines lots of flexibility to tailor their customer offering.

There are four A350-900s in the test program; they have accumulated just under 2,000 flight hours and the fifth test aircraft is about to join the program. Among major tests completed so far are the high energy rejected take off (HERTO), high-altitude testing, extreme hot/cold climate testing, and water trough testing. Certification is targeted for late summer/fall.

My sincere thanks to the Airbus flight-test team for providing this amazing opportunity while they are focused on a deadline-packed test program before first delivery to launch customer Qatar Airways at the end of the year.

Airbus Defense and Space and its client GeoNorth have inaugurated the first commercially available multi-satellite Direct Receiving Station (DRS) in the world, set to give a host of new markets quick access to both high-resolution and very high-resolution optical and radar satellite imagery.

The DRS in Fairbanks, Alaska, will give GeoNorth the unparalleled capability of priority tasking the Airbus Defense and Space satellite constellations to capture imagery anywhere on the globe and downlink data to its processing terminal. It draws on SPOT (5 and 6, and soon 7), Pléiades (1A and 1B), TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X satellites – with resolutions across optical and radar products ranging from 0.25m to 40m.

New customers, including small-scale customers who previously did not have such rapid access to such information, will be able to collect and downlink data in an instant. The GeoNorth DRS is set to bring in a wider range of clients and contracts for both companies given that GeoNorth is an Alaska Native Corporation – a status that among other benefits gives it procurement preference in the US.

The new DRS will have applications for the North American market, in particular for major business areas in Alaska, including: oil, gas & mining; infrastructure development; fisheries and ice monitoring.

“Airbus Defense and Space welcomes GeoNorth both as a new partner and as the first multi-satellite radar and optical DRS operator,” said Bernhard Brenner, head of the Geo-Intelligence program line at Airbus Defense and Space. “The more ground terminals like this there are in the world, the better it is for our customers because we can provide them with data more quickly than ever before.”

This new DRS brings the number of stations in the Airbus Defense and Space DRS network, the largest worldwide, to nearly 40. The network allows customers to downlink imagery instantly each time a satellite passes over the stations, thereby ensuring rapid delivery of fresh data and services in near-real time. In addition, the ability to more frequently download images frees up memory on-board the satellites and as such increases acquisition capacity. Airbus Defense and Space offers the broadest multi-sensor portfolio on the market in terms of resolution and responsiveness – as well as availability in all weather conditions.

“We at GeoNorth are delighted to be able to inaugurate and operate this new Direct Receiving Station,” said Martin Hanofee, of GeoNorth. “The addition of optical and radar remote sensing capture and processing capabilities complements and expands our existing geospatial technologies expertise.

ShandsCair air medical program in Florida adds new Airbus Helicopters EC155 - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 09 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL3NoYW5kc2NhaXJhaXJtZWRpY2FscHJvZ3JhbWluZmxvcmlkYWFkZHNuZXdhaXJidXNoZWxpY29wdGVycy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ShandsCair Flight Program, the air medical transport service of UF Health, has taken delivery of a new Airbus Helicopters EC155 specially customized for transporting critically ill patients. The helicopter was purchased from Airbus Helicopters Inc. (AHI) in Grand Prairie, and will be operated by Med-Trans Corp.

The new helicopter was recently delivered from Metro Aviation in Shreveport, which designed and installed the customized medical transport equipment. Metro Aviation received an FAA Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) for a complete Emergency Medical System kit and associated options for the EC155 B1 in December of 2011. “Metro Aviation has been a premier completion partner. We could not be more pleased with the process and final product,” said ShandsCair flight program director Staccie Allen. “The level of care we provide is significantly enhanced by the increased speed and distance we can now travel.”

ShandsCair will base the EC155 out of Gainesville, Fla. With the helicopter’s added speed, 360-nautical mile range and spacious cabin, along with the mission specific equipment, ShandsCair will be able to provide high quality air medical transport service to much of the southeastern U.S.

ShandsCair chose the EC155 for its missions after an extensive review of available helicopters, said Allen. Among the key factors that led ShandsCair to choose the EC155, were cabin size and range.

“What we wanted to accomplish in our mission dictated the aircraft we evaluated,” Allen said. “We are a very unique medical institution in a small university town serving a large rural area. We needed to be able to transport two patients at one time.”

“The EC155 is the right-size aircraft for our program,” said Allen. The helicopter’s long range will enable the program to transport patients non-stop to and from distant facilities, missions that previously required the use of both a helicopter and a fixed-wing aircraft. “It does everything we were hoping to do,” Allen said.

Working with Airbus Helicopters Inc., ShandsCair selected the EC155 and specified the customized interior and medical equipment after extensive consultations with the University of Michigan Health System Survival Flight program, which operates three EC155’s that were also completed by Metro Aviation.

“ShandsCair is one of the nation’s finest air medical transport programs and we are honored that after careful evaluation they selected the EC155 as the right helicopter to complement their existing fleet and to provide the capability to offer improved services to their hospitals and patients,” said Treg Manning, vice president of sales and marketing for Airbus Helicopters Inc.

The new helicopter is the result of a $12 million investment by UF Health to expand the capacity to serve patients throughout Florida and improve hospital transport times. Med-Trans Corp., based out of Lewisville, Texas and recognized as a leading air medical operator, operates two EC135s for ShandsCair as well as the new EC155.

“ShandsCair is recognized as one of the foremost air medical flight programs in the industry, said Rob Hamilton, chief operating officer of Med-Trans Corp. “We very much value our partnership with UF Health and we are pleased to play a role in their ongoing dedication and service to the many critical patients in need of air medical transport throughout the ShandsCair service region each year.”"
Airbus Helicopters Inc. delivers new AS350 B3e helicopter to Mississippi Department of Public Safety - Vertical Magazine,"Fri, 20 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1c2hlbGljb3B0ZXJzaW5jZGVsaXZlcnNuZXdhczM1MGIzZWhlbGljb3B0ZXJ0b21pc3Npc3NpcC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Captain Ron Kelley of the Mississippi Highway Patrol Air Wing has accepted delivery of an Airbus Helicopters Inc. AS350 B3e AStar produced for the Mississippi Department of Public Safety (DPS). The new law enforcement-equipped helicopter is a Mississippi-built product.

Kelley, commander of the Highway Patrol Air Wing, said the AS350 B3e was clearly the best aircraft for the department’s missions. “We considered price first, and Airbus had the best. Equally as important, we considered the functionality of the aircraft. Airbus’ cockpit design is better for our mission-specific operation. We also considered performance and payload capability, and this model beat the competition.”

Airbus Helicopters Inc. (AHI) operates a helicopter assembly plant in Columbus, Miss., and employs a workforce of nearly 300 people, about fifty percent of whom are military veterans.

“I’m delighted that our home state will now own one of our aircraft,” said Sam Adcock, vice president and general manager of the AHI Columbus facility. “Our employees work hard and have a strong sense of ownership in producing the highest quality helicopters. They will be proud to point to this aircraft with the Mississippi Highway Patrol paint scheme, and claim it as one of our own.”

Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant, who was on hand for the delivery ceremony, said the new helicopter is a welcome addition to the state’s law enforcement tools. “I announced before the 2014 Mississippi legislative session this year was going to be the ‘Year of Public Safety’ in Mississippi,” Bryant said. “This state-of-the-art helicopter produced by Mississippians will go a long way in meeting the needs of the public on many fronts. Airbus is a valued partner to Mississippi and we appreciate being able to work with them on the manufacturing and delivery of this helicopter.”

AHI leads the U.S. market in sales of new helicopters to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, maintaining a 56 percent market share over the last decade. The spacious cabin and numerous modern safety features of the AS350 series, including energy-attenuating seats and dual-screen Vehicle and Engine Multifunction Display, make the AStar an industry leader. The ability to install nearly any type of equipment on the AS350 B3e for multi-mission flexibility makes it a favorite with law enforcement agencies.

The AS350 B3e’s multi-mission capability for patrol, drug eradication and hurricane support was a good fit for the Mississippi Highway Patrol requirements. Mississippi DPS sold its aging helicopter fleet to provide funding for the purchase of the new AS350 B3e. More than 220 Airbus Helicopters AS350 AStars are operated by U.S. law enforcement agencies."

Airbus suffered its biggest-ever order cancellation as Emirates Airlines scrapped a deal for A350 aircraft valued at $16 billion, according to Bloomberg.

Emirates cancelled an order for 70 Airbus A350 aircraft. According to the report, Airbus said Emirates will drop 50 A350-900s and 20 larger -1000s.

The manufacturer, according to The Associated Press, saw its share price sink 4 percent in morning trading.

""The A350 is a good aircraft, it's a clean ship, it's cutting edge, but I don't think the delivery schedule of the A350 fits in line with Emirates' growth capabilities at this moment,"" Mark D. Martin, chief executive officer of Dubai-based Martin Consulting LLC., told Bloomberg.

Beginning in 2015, Airbus will assemble A320 family aircraft at Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley, where a $600 million final assembly line is currently under construction.

The New York Times is reporting the Emirates order was valued at roughly $16 billion when it was placed in 2007; at current list prices, it would be worth more than $21 billion.

""The contract which we signed in 2007 for 70 A350 aircraft has lapsed,"" a spokeswoman for the airline said. ""We are reviewing our fleet requirements.""

Per the Times:

The Emirates order was the second-largest in Airbus's A350 order book, behind Qatar Airways with 80 aircraft and alongside Singapore Airlines with 70. It represented about 9 percent of Airbus's total outstanding orders for the new plane."
Airbus Helicopters presents its latest innovative solutions for medical emergency services operators - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 03 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1c2hlbGljb3B0ZXJzcHJlc2VudHNpdHNsYXRlc3Rpbm5vdmF0aXZlc29sdXRpb25zZm9ybWVkaS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As the leading helicopter manufacturer in helicopter emergency medical services – with a 60 percent market share – Airbus Helicopters is introducing its evolved EC145 T2 rotorcraft in the helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) configuration.

The twin-engine EC145 T2 is showcased at the AIRMED World Congress in Rome, Italy with new HEMS and mountain rescue equipment, presented as a full-scale mock-up developed in cooperation with the Mecaer Aviation Group equipment supplier.

Also on display is a scale model of the EC135, which is a helicopter of choice for HEMS operators in both primary and secondary missions. Approximately 25 percent of all medical emergency operations around the globe are performed with this aircraft.

“With more than 40 years experience in Emergency Medical Services we offer the widest range of helicopters for HEMS operations,” explained Ralph Setz, Airbus Helicopters’ senior marketing director for HEMS and Public Services. “More than 300 customers worldwide – who deploy some 1,200 Airbus Helicopters rotorcraft in this sector – trust in our products and services for their daily operations. We are constantly committed to further developing innovations to support them in this life-critical mission segment.”

To increase the EC145 T2’s adaptability in HEMS missions, Airbus Helicopters will introduce new cabin installation features that include the latest equipment definitions. An innovative outfitting option, called EMS Fixed Provisions, has been developed by Airbus Helicopters for this 4-metric-ton category rotorcraft in coordination with leading emergency medical services equipment suppliers and integrators. This provides standardized interfaces for customized hardware and systems – reducing outfitting time and providing a more rapid service entry.

After its introduction on the EC145 T2, the EMS Fixed Provisions concept may be adapted to other Airbus Helicopters rotorcraft.

The EC145 T2 is Airbus Helicopters’ newest member in its twin-engine, four-metric-ton category EC145 product line, which has become one of the world’s most successful HEMS aircraft families. Following the EC145 T2’s certification in April 2014, deliveries will begin later this year – with four major European helicopter emergency services operators to receive the initial aircraft. Enhancements in the EC145 T2 include new Turbomeca Arriel 2E engines and the company’s signature Fenestron shrouded tail rotor, along with upgraded main and new tail rotor gear boxes. The advanced cockpit uses Airbus Helicopters’ innovative Helionix digital avionics suite with four-axis autopilot.

An innovative concept developed by Airbus Helicopters for its 2.9-metric-ton category EC135 is the Multi-Functional Floor, which is tailored for HEMS customers and also applicable to other para-public operators. It eliminates the need for separate standard floors and those optimized for HEMS missions, thereby saving weight while offering a performance-focused multi-functional floor for the HEMS market.

The new floor is designed for harsh environments and demanding missions, with operators benefitting from its excellent weight/performance, robustness and impermeability. To be certified this year, the Multi-Functional Floor can be utilized on all EC135 variants, and also will be offered as a retrofit option.

The twin-engine EC135 combines a wide, unobstructed cabin with excellent performance, range and payload capacity – along with a low-noise output. Its oversized sliding side doors and rear clamshell doors enable fast loading/unloading of patients – with additional safety during ground operations ensured by Airbus Helicopters’ signature shrouded Fenestron tail rotor. The EC135 T3/P3 is the latest upgraded version of the EC135, and is due to be delivered this year. Among the launching customers is a mountain rescue operator. The new model’s improved features include increased flight performance in hot and high environments and in single-engine situations (or OEI, One Engine Inoperative).

Both the EC145 T2 and EC135 are compliant with the stringent European medical Norm EN13718 for operational and technical requirements used in air ambulances, as well as for the interfaces and compatibility of medical devices utilized in HEMS operations.

Airbus Helicopters will be exhibiting at booth #14 during the AIRMED World Congress, to be held June 3 to 5 at Rome’s Palazzo dei Congressi."
"Viewing decks, panoramic windows, sound showers and a lot more Airbus reveals what air travel will be like in 2050 - Luxurylaunches","Sat, 14 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vbHV4dXJ5bGF1bmNoZXMuY29tL3RyYXZlbC9mdXR1cmUtb2YtYWlyLXRyYXZlbC1ieS1haXJidXMucGhw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In the last fifty years or more, the aviation industry and the passenger aircrafts have undergone huge transformation. The new generation aircrafts are faster, bigger and offer extremely pleasant flight experience and the Airbus A380 is one of the finest examples of it. But in the last half-a-century, the basic structure and the foundation of aircrafts have remained the same and the future of aviation we see in the sci-fi flicks continues to be fiction or a distant dream. So what really is the future of aviation? We have had concept designers give us a clue like the AWWA Sky Whale Concept, but we are all aware that they are more of fantasies than reality, but now Airbus has revealed what it believes would be the future of flying in 2050.





The makers of Airbus A380, considered to be the best commercial jet in the world currently, predicting what air travel will be like in 2050 revealed that planes of the future will have zones dedicated to relaxing and playing games, panoramic windows and seats that collect our body heat to power in-cabin features. Airbus said passengers will be able to relax in massaging seats that also serve drinks and vitamins autonomously and offer either a sea breeze or a scent of fresh pine. The planes will also feature sound showers that will ease passengers into sound sleep, snug in the warm embrace of special shades to keep out the light.



In the current commercial jets, we have small windows to peek outside for a view, but in future the jets will have a viewing area on the upper deck with panoramic windows, which can become transparent at the wave or a hand or remain opaque in certain areas thanks to an integrated neural network which can detect and respond to the specific needs of each passenger. Even the fittings and furnishings on the jet will take care of their own cleaning and repairs achieved through dirt repellent coatings and self healing covers.



On the aircraft the social areas like the bars will also be more accessible while pop-up pods will offer more private spaces that can be used for anything from business to private needs. Airbus also predicts that it will have features like virtual shopping wall which will project clothes directly on to passengers and the virtual gaming wall will let tennis, baseball and even golf fans keep busy. According to Airbus research, every flight in the world could on average be around 13 minutes shorter, saving around nine million tones of excess fuel annually, which equates to over 28 million tones of avoidable CO2 emissions and a saving for passengers of over 500 million hours of excess flight time on board an aircraft. This will make air travel not only cheaper, but more efficient, safer and much more exciting. Check out the video and the concept renderings after the jump.

Airbus Helicopters delivers three workhorse EC225s to Milestone Aviation Group for African oil and gas operations by ... - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 05 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1c2hlbGljb3B0ZXJzZGVsaXZlcnN0aHJlZXdvcmtob3JzZWVjMjI1c3RvbWlsZXN0b25lYXZpYS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The worldwide fleet of EC225s that perform heli-lift duties for oil and gas operators has increased by three with Airbus Helicopters’ triple delivery of workhorse rotorcraft acquired by Milestone Aviation Group and leased to SonAir – an African operator – which will utilize them in Angola.

The handover ceremony in Marignane, France marked the latest such EC225 deliveries by Airbus Helicopters, with these rotorcraft expanding SonAir’s operating fleet, which already includes 12 EC225s, four AS332 L2s and three AS365 N3s.

Underscoring the importance of the event were the attendance of SonAir CEO João Andrade; a team of representatives from Milestone Aviation Group, a global leader in helicopter leasing; along with a representative of the oil and gas company as the end-user.

“This event celebrates our first deliveries to Milestone, emphasizing the EC225’s importance within the expanding helicopter leasing market,” said Airbus Helicopters CEO Guillaume Faury. “It also highlights the confidence SonAir accords to the EC225 as a powerful, and highly capable, helicopter for the most demanding missions.”

The helicopters delivered yesterday are part of Milestone Aviation’s record orders with Airbus Helicopters for 30 total EC225s, which were announced in 2012 and 2013.

“We are excited to commence a relationship with SonAir, Africa’s largest offshore oil and gas operator, with these three EC225s” explained Milestone Aviation’s managing director Robert Dranitzke. “As a true workhorse in offshore oil and gas operations, the EC225 continues to demonstrate its capability in the most demanding operational conditions – from the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico to Africa – and we are confident these aircraft will serve SonAir and its customers well in the years to come.”

SonAir is a subsidiary of the Sonangol Group, a structured aviation service provider in Angola, and the largest African helicopter operator. Its inventory of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft provide services to major oil and gas companies as its core business.

“By further growing our EC225 fleet, SonAir’s customers will benefit from the performance delivered by this helicopter,” added SonAir’s Andrade. “The EC225 has become a mainstay of our operations, and proves its capabilities every day.”

The EC225 is Airbus Helicopters’ latest version of its Super Puma family, providing a high-performance rotorcraft in the 10-11 metric ton category. This heavy twin-engine helicopter’s modern technologies, excellent useful load, five-blade main rotor and low vibration levels make it an efficient solution for oil and gas missions – including offshore and passenger transport as well as search and rescue (SAR) operations."

The Dubai-based airline had ordered the planes from Airbus in 2007, due for delivery in 2019.

Rolls-Royce is the sole manufacturer and supplier of the engines for the A350, seen as Airbus's answer to Boeing's Dreamliner.

The British engineering firm, which has bases in Derby and Bristol, said the cancellation would shave 3.5% from its order books, but was hopeful that other airlines would fill the delivery slots.

It had already warned of stalling profits and revenues due to defence spending cuts. Its shares fell 2.5% to £10.51 on news of the loss of the Emirates order.

Rolls-Royce said: ""Demand for the Airbus A350 remains strong, with more than 700 aircraft and 1,400 Trent XWB engines already sold. We retain a close working relationship with Emirates and continue to support their 38 Rolls-Royce-powered wide body aircraft currently in service.""

Emirates is by some distance the world's largest purchaser of Airbus's superjumbo, the A380, and retains a close relationship with the European manufacturer, ordering 50 more A380s at the last Dubai air show.

Airbus said the decision followed ongoing discussions as Emirates reviewed its fleet requirements.

It said: ""Airbus and Emirates benefit from a long-standing relationship and the airline recently reiterated its confidence in Airbus products particularly by praising the A380 and the benefits the aircraft brings to their operations.""

Airbus said it remained confident in its A350s, with 742 firm orders ahead of the plane's entry into service later this year."

Speaking to Flight Global during a press event in Washington recently, Delta's CEO, Richard Anderson, said: “We’re hopeful that the 787-9, with all the lessons learned on the -8, is going to be a really viable airplane.”

One of the US market's more conservative aircraft buyers, Delta is currently studying the A330-200 and A330-300, A350-900 and A350-1000 on offer from Airbus (AIB, Toulouse Blagnac) while a pitch from Boeing (BOE, Washington National) includes the B777-300(ER) as well as B787-8, B787-9 and B787-10 jets.

When flying first isn’t enough, there's pimping rides in the sky.

Billionaires are eschewing the puny $65 million Gulfstream --the private jet of choice for many executives -- and opting to buy and customize their own commercial Airbus A380 or Boeing 747 models.

Boeing and Airbus have reportedly had a spike in private sales to the super-rich of these planes -- designed to carry hundreds of passengers at a time.

The reason?

Airbus commissioned a “Billionaires Study” and it turns out the very wealthy often like to travel with numerous family members or dozens of business associates.

According to Wired, big jet manufactures have been stripping their commercial models of economy seating and replacing them with luxury interiors since the late 1990s. But a new influx of foreign big spenders from Russia, China and the Middle East has led to an expansion of the private jumbo jet business.

Since 1997, Airbus has sold over 170 private air crafts. Boeing, which opened its custom division in 1996, has finished 195 units out of 217 order.

So what features can one expect on a custom luxury jet? Queen sized bedrooms with wood paneled closets. Bathrooms with luxury jet showers. Grand sitting rooms and meeting areas that could comfortably accommodate every member of the board.

Airbus and Boeing have not disclosed the exact cost of these ultra-luxe planes, but Wired estimated that these planes can fetch anywhere between $80 million to a whopping $300 million.

This comes as commercial carriers are ramping business and first class features. In May, Etihad Airlines announced its super-luxe flying apartments, which come with a living room, separate bedroom and and an en-suite shower."

From the data we have so far it seems to be a very reliable system.” The company is offering an enhanced version with a maximum weight of 350kg – including a 50kg payload – capable of operating for more than 8h.

Recent successes elsewhere within the Airbus UAV portfolio have included a deal to provide Cameroon with Copter 4 unmanned helicopters and hand-launched DVF 2000s, says Nielsen.

Meanwhile, Nielsen says the German defence ministry is considering its options on a future signals intelligence-gathering capability, following last year’s cancellation of the Airbus/Northrop Grumman Euro Hawk programme. One potential activity could study the use of another variant of the Northrop RQ-4 Global Hawk airframe – specifically the US Navy’s MQ-8B Triton – as a replacement platform.

I had the pleasure of speaking to Airbus Defence test pilot Chris Worning about Typhoon’s performance.

Have you encountered any aircraft that out-climb Typhoon?

The Raptor might be able to, but that’s it, it’s the same story with acceleration. It is a true supersonic aeroplane. Even with tanks on.

The speed quoting for Typhoon’s maximum supercruise varies in press releases, what figure would you put on it?

It’s around 1, 1.2 (Mach), you can figure it out yourself because the supersonic drag peaks at up around Mach 1 or 1.05, and then it comes down, and the other side of this is where we normally settle down.



And how long can it cruise at Mach 1.2?

It mostly depends on the atmosphere. On a standard day you sit down at M1.15 or M1.2- but if it’s really cold up high you get more out of it that day. Aeroplanes are quite susceptible to temperatures. You can sit there till you run out of gas, and because you’re in dry power you don’t use a lot of gas. I’ve never had enough space to travel that far in one direction, but you certainly sit there for 15 or 20 minutes."
Wider slides key to raising A320 seat-count - Flightglobal,"Thu, 12 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vd2lkZXItc2xpZGVzLWtleS10by1yYWlzaW5nLWEzMjAtc2VhdC1jb3VudC8xMTM0OTMuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus will use wider evacuation slides to secure approval for higher exit limits on its A320neo, as it plans to offer a 189-seat layout for the twin-engined jet.

The A320 features two pairs of exits, forward and aft, which easily exceed Type C door requirements. It also has two pairs of Type III overwing exits.

It is certificated to carry a maximum of 180 passengers but Airbus wants to raise this to 189 with an internal configuration change.

A320neo senior vice-president Klaus Roewe, speaking during a briefing in Toulouse, said that authorities had “reassessed” the aircraft based on the larger door and the installation of a wider slide.

Airbus

Roewe says that, with this combination, the A320 “can comfortably go beyond the current evacuation limit”.

The changes can apply to the baseline A320 as well as the A320neo and first deliveries could take place in early 2015.

Airbus is also introducing a new design standard for the A321neo which will enable the aircraft to accommodate 240 passengers, 20 more than its current 220-seat limit.

Airbus

The standard configuration will comprise the forward pair of main doors and the two pairs of aft doors, plus a pair of overwing exits.

It will offer a second overwing exit as an option, while the current third exit pair, behind the wing, will move four frames further aft.

Roewe says that, with Airbus’s space-saving rear galley, the aircraft can offer a 240-seat configuration. There will be a “bit of weight” associated with the change but it will provide a 6% per-seat fuel-burn reduction.

“We are confident there’ll be a high take-up rate for this layout, because it’s not really compromising on the comfort,” he says. Airbus intends to offer kits to customers wanting the flexibility to switch between layouts.

Roewe says that only around 5% of A321s have a 220-seat layout but that the airframer expects this proportion to increase to as much as 40%, given the trend towards customers ordering larger single-aisle aircraft.

Airbus shows off A350 after a year of testing - Flightglobal,"Thu, 12 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXNob3dzLW9mZi1hMzUwLWFmdGVyLWEteWVhci1vZi10ZXN0aW5nLzExMzQ4NC5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has introduced the A350-900 to travellers outside of the company with a special media flight to coincide with a briefing on the programme at Toulouse.

Just shy of one year since the A350’s maiden flight, the airframer secured approval to remove MSN2 from the flight-test programme temporarily in order to carry out the 12 June service for around 200 members of the press.

The Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-powered aircraft departed Toulouse runway 32L, after a ground run of 31s, at a weight of 192t including 30t of fuel for the one-hour trip.

Flight-test controllers took responsibility for the A350 to ensure separation from regular traffic.

After take-off, at about 135kt, the aircraft headed west towards Lourdes, climbing to around 31,000ft.

Under a co-operative arrangement with military controllers at Mont-de-Marsan the A350 underwent an intercept exercise involving a Dassault Rafale fighter.

“They often ask to come and intercept for their own practice,” says A350 test pilot Peter Chandler.

The fighter was instructed to maintain 500m separation, because the A350 was carrying passengers. “Normally they’ll come closer than that,” says Chandler, adding that distances of 100m are not unusual.

MSN2, which had logged some 155h by the beginning of June, is one of two cabin-equipped A350s in the test fleet.

The aircraft flew eastwards, parallel to the Pyrenees mountain range, before turning right and briefly overflying Spanish territory, then descending back towards Toulouse, landing at a weight of 186t having burned about 6t of fuel.

Airbus flight-test senior vice-president Fernando Alonso, who was also on board, said he was “prudently optimistic” over the progress on A350 certification since the maiden flight on 14 June last year.

“There’s not much time for celebration because there’s a lot of work still to do,” he says.

A350 head of development flight test Patrick du Che says the fleet will shortly pass 2,000h – from a campaign due to last 2,500h – and that the airframer is achieving its highest test-flight rates with the type, flying some 80h per month.

The second cabin-fitted A350, MSN5, is to fly “very soon”, he says, with a maiden sortie intended by the end of June. “Then we’ll concentrate the certification activities on this aircraft,” says du Che.

MSN5 will carry out route proving including a three-week campaign during which the aircraft will accumulate around 200h operating to several destinations around the world.

Columbus, MS (PRWEB) - Captain Ron Kelly of the Mississippi Highway Patrol Air Wing accepted delivery Tuesday of an Airbus Helicopters Inc. AS350 B3e AStar produced for the Mississippi Department of Public Safety (DPS). The new law enforcement-equipped helicopter is a Mississippi-built product.

Kelly, commander of the Highway Patrol Air Wing, said the AS350 B3e was clearly the best aircraft for the department’s missions. “We considered price first, and Airbus had the best. Equally as important, we considered the functionality of the aircraft. Airbus’ cockpit design is better for our mission-specific operation. We also considered performance and payload capability, and this model beat the competition.”

Airbus Helicopters Inc. (AHI) operates a helicopter assembly plant in Columbus, Miss., and employs a workforce of nearly 300 people, about fifty percent of whom are military veterans.

“I’m delighted that our home state will now own one of our aircraft,” said Sam Adcock, Vice President and General Manager of the AHI Columbus facility. “Our employees work hard and have a strong sense of ownership in producing the highest quality helicopters. They will be proud to point to this aircraft with the Mississippi Highway Patrol paint scheme, and claim it as one of our own.”

Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant, who was on hand for the delivery ceremony, said the new helicopter is a welcome addition to the state’s law enforcement tools. “I announced before the 2014 Mississippi legislative session, this year was going to be the ‘Year of Public Safety’ in Mississippi,” Bryant said. “This state-of-the-art helicopter produced by Mississippians will go a long way in meeting the needs of the public on many fronts. Airbus is a valued partner to Mississippi, and we appreciate being able to work with them on the manufacturing and delivery of this helicopter.”

AHI leads the U.S. market in sales of new helicopters to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, maintaining a 56 percent market share over the last decade. The spacious cabin and numerous modern safety features of the AS350 series, including energy-attenuating seats and dual-screen Vehicle and Engine Multifunction Display, make the AStar an industry leader. The ability to install nearly any type of equipment on the AS350 B3e for multi-mission flexibility makes it a favorite with law enforcement agencies.

The AS350 B3e’s multi-mission capability for patrol, drug eradication and hurricane support was a good fit for the Mississippi Highway Patrol requirements. Mississippi DPS sold its aging helicopter fleet to provide funding for the purchase of the new AS350 B3e. More than 220 Airbus Helicopters AS350 AStars are operated by U.S. law enforcement agencies.

Vueling CEO sees 186-seat A320 without loss of pitch - Runway Girl Network,"Tue, 10 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTQvMDYvdnVlbGluZy1jZW8tc2Vlcy0xODYtc2VhdC1hMzIwLXdpdGhvdXQtbG9zcy1waXRjaC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has yet to announce how it will go about recertifying the A320 for 186 seats, but one operator of the type is hopeful this can be achieved without reducing seat pitch.

Alex Cruz, chief executive of Barcelona-based A320 operator Vueling, tells Runway Girl Network that he is “very attracted by the idea of increasing the numbers of seats by the implementation of the Airbus Space-Flex solution”, adding: “We hope that this feature will be certified soon.”

Vueling, a subsidiary of British Airways and Iberia parent company IAG, last August placed a firm order for 30 A320s and 32 A320neos, with options on a further 58 A320-family aircraft.

The Spanish carrier has been pushing for an extra row of seats to be made available as an option on the A320, but Cruz does not believe Airbus will achieve this by reducing seat pitch.

“We do see Airbus introducing the Space-Flex feature, which removes the two toilets at the back, putting them as part of the galley in the back, therefore achieving two things: adding an extra row, six seats; and providing additional space to actually increase the pitch of the last 15 rows of the aircraft,” he says.

“We are always working with Airbus to drive innovation in the 320 family and we are happy that they are finally able to push this particular feature for certification.”

Adds Cruz: “Recently, [Airbus] made some small changes to allow a bit more space from the emergency exits to the front of the aircraft, so today we offer four rows of extra pitch and the rest are standard.

“Removing toilets at the back is about another row and a little bit more space to be redistributed between the back rows. This is key to the product.”

An Airbus spokesman says the manufacturer is “not going to discuss how a particular airline would arrange its internal seating product”. He adds that Airbus is unable to immediately provide any general comment on the A320 recertification plan because it is preparing to host a group of journalists for its ‘Innovation Day’.

The fact that Airbus has not disclosed how it will add the extra six seats means it has not discounted the possibility of reducing seat pitch below the current bare minimum of 28 inches, a scenario that remains a very real possibility in the industry at large.

Ultra slimline economy class seat concepts that could accommodate a 27-inch pitch are under development at Zodiac Aerospace. So it looks like a case of watch this (ever-decreasing) space.

High density A380 pitched to operators; Emirates cools on idea - Runway Girl Network,"Mon, 02 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTQvMDYvaGlnaC1kZW5zaXR5LWEzODAtcGl0Y2hlZC10by1vcGVyYXRvcnMtZW1pcmF0ZXMtY29vbHMtb24taWRlYS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Antiquated yield management systems are serving as an impediment to securing commitments for higher-density Airbus A380s, suggests Mark Lapidus, CEO of Amedeo. Even so, the executive is confident Airbus will complete development of an 11-abreast A380 in late 2016, when the leasing company is scheduled to start taking delivery of a 20-strong order inked at the Singapore Air Show.

Lapidus made a splash at this year’s ISTAT conference in San Diego when he revealed that Airbus intends to raise the floor of the A380 in order to offer an 11-abreast configuration with 18-inch wide seats. He later told Flightglobal that a late 2016 completion date is feasible, and that the redesign likely won’t create a new A380 build standard. If this is the case, perhaps Airbus will simply add a false floor to raise the seats? This might be what Airbus executives were alluding to in Hamburg.

In a follow-up interview with RGN, Lapidus said airlines “maybe just are not quite up to date” on their yield management systems, which use “hard wired numbers from a generation ago”. As such, putting “a 600-plus seat aircraft on a route” isn’t necessarily a walk in the park. It takes a lot more than that development of an 11-abreast A380 “to get the airlines around the corner”, he added.

“It’s a process where they need to think through the right routes, and 11-abreast will help them if they think their yield management systems can handle the extra capacity. It’s part of the process on those key trunk routes [trying to grow] by 10% where frequency does not help either because of infrastructure constraints or departure times for higher ticket prices; it’s those routes where it makes sense.”

Emirates, which leases four A380s from Amedeo (and previously leased 18 with Lapidus’ prior company) had been considered a likely candidate to take delivery of A380s configured 11-abreast in economy. The carrier – whose current A380s are configured 10-abreast in economy – previously said it was eager for Airbus to retain an 18-inch seat width, which is driving Airbus’ floor raising work, as seats are inched up to the fatter part of the tube.

But the carrier appears to be backing away from the idea. This morning The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Emirates president Tim Clark is no longer even considering it.

The A380 serves as the flagship for several top tier carriers, including Emirates, and its seating across classes sets the standard for their fleets.

“Emirates has a completely different product on the A380 versus its 777s. The A380 is far better – with 19-inch economy width – and your own business class space. So there are two elements to product experience: physical and perception. Perception with Emirates is that you will have an A380 experience [when you fly with the carrier] and when you happen to fly a 777, I found that I did not penalize Emirates for this as I internalized it as a temporary state and that the next time I will be on an A380. Emirates could not offer this overall experience if it only had 777s and a lesser product in its overall network,” says Lapidus.

Perhaps Emirates fears that, if it adopts an 11-abreast A380, it will jeopardize passenger perception of its overall offering. After all, seat width on Emirates’ forthcoming Boeing 777-9X could be as low as 16.7-inch wide seat, claims Lapidus.

Boeing, however, disputes this assertion. According to the airframer, the interior will be 4 inches wider than the current 777-300ER, and a typical seat will be 17.2 inches to 17.7 inches in width at 10-abreast dependent on the armrest and aisles chosen.

Emirates is already poised to take delivery next year of a 619-seat A380, configured 10-abreast in economy, and “that is a very compelling package”, says Lapidus. “So not everyone has to do 11-abreast”.

With that said, the ability to offer a premium economy or economy plus section – while retaining a high density in economy – could be appealing to other A380 operators. To this end, Amedeo has tabled a proposal for a 590-seat A380 inclusive of premium economy.

As pictured, the lower deck would be configured with all economy seating (as it is today), though I must admit my immediate response to seeing this image is that it looks something akin to a slave ship. While a 590-seat A380 with true premium economy seating – configured 8-abreast – is seen here, Lapidus also believes airlines would consider offering 11-abreast in economy and 10-abreast in an economy plus section featuring “19-inch wide seats like Emirates has today and that would be a fantastic product”. Airlines could simply “break their classes in between the doors”.

He says a 19-inch wide seat with a little more legroom “is pretty good as a global standard but we’re not trying to impose our views on what those comfort standards are, and airlines can define their brand in any way they think it’s right”. Moreover, “it doesn’t necessarily mean that everyone jumps on the bandwagon of economy plus, but that seams to be a growing segment where people are making very good profit”.

The Amadeo CEO says first class is “not generating profitability for airlines, but used for spill over from business, and part of projecting the brand”. Business class tickets, for example, “are selling for say $6,000” and then you have a precipitous drop in price for economy, which leaves room for an economy plus seat.

Already a fan of the A380’s economics, Lapidus says higher density A380s will “remain the best” in terms of unit costs “when the A350-1000 and 777-9X arrive, but it [11-abreast in economy] will make it even better. The A380 doesn’t need 11-abreast to be the best against the new planes; it already is, but with 11-abreast you have flexibility of fitting out your aircraft for a multiple product offering,” says the man who is very eager to place his 20 new A380s with customers.

“The A380 has a lower unit cost at 10-abreast verusus the A350-1000, in comparable comfort configuration, in apples to apples arrangements, or per square foot of available usable space, a measure we are introducing to shed sunlight on the smog of using incomparable seat counts. And more so against 777-9X, based on Boeing statements on performance improvements of the 777-9X versus the 777-300ER. Now if we go 11-abreast, those unit cost advantages will become double digit versus comparable comfort configurations.”

Lapidus concludes, “Whatever an airline may choose in properly managing its yield and brand, we are cool with, as long as it is clear that A380 has the lowest unit costs versus the new big planes in apples to apples comparisons.”"

The historic landing―coordinated with the Mexican Civil Aviation Authority (DGAC) and undertaken in accordance with international operating standards―underscores the extraordinary power and reliability of an aircraft capable of operating at extreme altitudes and temperatures. This is the same model that set a new world record in 2005 by landing and taking off from the summit of Mount Everest.

The two men at the controls of the aircraft were flight captain José Luis Zamora Rodríguez and flight engineer Erick Pérez Velázquez, both of whom work for the European manufacturer, which has been present in Mexico for more than 30 years.

“It is very satisfying to see the AS350 B3e adapt perfectly to the diverse operating conditions of the Mexican terrain,” said Serge Durand, the CEO of Airbus Helicopters’ local subsidiary. “Thanks to this and its versatility, we are confident the aircraft will be deployed in all types of missions, both in the civil and governmental realm. It is our wish to continue investing in the Mexican aviation industry and promoting, in the medium term, the manufacture of “Made in Mexico” helicopters that comply with international standards.”

Airbus Helicopters employs around 300 people at its facilities in Mexico City, Veracruz and Querétaro, where a high-technology plant manufacturing aircraft components was opened last year in the presence of Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto.

There are 500 Airbus Helicopters aircraft providing services in the region under the responsibility of the Mexican subsidiary. The fleet includes the Ecureuil AS350 B3, used in public services, private transport and utility aerial work; the EC145, operating in the oil & gas industry; the Dauphin family of helicopters, dedicated to private transport and operations in the oil & gas industry; and the EC725/EC225, used by the Mexican Air Force, Navy and other government forces."

Airbus to use Tianjin as delivery hub|Business|chinadaily.com.cn - Chinadaily USA,"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHA6Ly91c2EuY2hpbmFkYWlseS5jb20uY24vZXBhcGVyLzIwMTQtMDYvMTcvY29udGVudF8xNzU5NDYxMS5odG3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus to use Tianjin as delivery hub Updated: 2014-06-17 07:03 By Lu Haoting (China Daily USA)

France-based Airbus SAS plans to make more direct aircraft deliveries to Asian carriers from Tianjin, a top company official said recently.

The European aircraft manufacturer said it aims to make the northern port city its Asian hub and indicated that the final assembly line in Tianjin would start its second phase of operations from 2016. This ""opens the possibility of delivering directly to customers outside China"", said Rafael Gonzalez-Ripoll, Airbus China chief operating officer.

The factory in Tianjin, Airbus' only final assembly line outside Europe, has delivered 172 aircraft to 13 carriers. It has only marginally delivered outside China through leasing companies. Malaysian low-cost carrier AirAsia is the only foreign airline operating a leased A320 assembled in Tianjin.

""We will proactively convince our customers outside China to take delivery from Tianjin. All Asian customers are subject to this,"" Gonzalez-Ripoll said.

""I don't expect negative reaction for that because there is no difference in quality (between aircraft assembled in Tianjin and those in Europe). Tianjin is closer to their headquarters. It might save airlines' cost of transferring people to Tianjin compared with sending people to Europe. The ferry flight will be shorter,"" he said.

The Tianjin factory has been considered a jewel in Airbus' industrial cooperation with China. It delivered the first single-aisle A320 aircraft in June 2009. Airbus and its Chinese partners, Tianjin Free Trade Zone Investment Co and Aviation Industry Corp of China, agreed in March to extend the joint venture for an additional 10 years. The second phase will cover the period from 2016 to 2025.

The plant is expected to have a long-lasting impact on the future growth of the northern port city as it fosters a competitive supply chain locally. Tianjin could be the third-largest aviation center in the world soon, Eric Chen, Airbus China president, said earlier.

But more importantly, Chinese companies are also bidding to become suppliers to Airbus' first US-based production facility. Airbus started constructing the $600-million A320 final assembly line in the US state of Alabama, in April 2013, with aircraft assembly scheduled to begin in 2015 and the first delivery targeted for 2016.

Two local Chinese suppliers in Tianjin have won contracts for the project. Seven (Tianjin) Industrial Co Ltd has won the contract to supply wooden box packages to the factory in Alabama. Tianjin Saixiang Technology Co Ltd will supply transportation jigs and tools for the project.

""The US contract will have a positive effect on our business performance for the next two to three years,"" said Zhu Hongguang, board secretary of Saixiang.

China COSCO Logistics Co Ltd, the logistics supplier in the Tianjin factory, is also bidding to provide logistics services for the US project, said Gonzalez-Ripoll.

""Chinese companies are well positioned to get contracts or subcontracts for the final assembly line in Alabama as they have proved they are efficient suppliers with a competitive offer. It is a window of opportunity for our Chinese suppliers,"" said Gonzalez-Ripoll.

Airbus is expected to see its industrial turnover in China to reach $500 million next year as scheduled and is ambitious about increasing that to $1 billion by 2020, said the COO. The industrial turnover includes subcontracting of aircraft components from Chinese companies and revenues generated at Airbus' four joint ventures in China.

Gonzalez-Ripoll said Airbus will enhance subcontracting in China through developing new projects, in particular in the field of cabin interiors.

""Currently most of the cabin interior suppliers are from the US and Europe. But we know there are capabilities in China,"" Gonzalez-Ripoll said, without disclosing names of suppliers Airbus is talking with.

Hubei Ali Jiatai Aircraft Equipment Co Ltd, a subsidiary of AVIC, was awarded BFE (buyer furnished equipment) certificate by The Boeing Co last year. The Chinese company is now a seat supplier of limited offerability for the US-based aircraft manufacturer.

Airbus to target UAV record with improved Zephyr - Flightglobal,"Wed, 11 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXRvLXRhcmdldC11YXYtcmVjb3JkLXdpdGgtaW1wcm92ZWQtemVwaHlyLzExMzQ3Mi5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus will later this year conduct a flight test campaign with an improved version of the Zephyr high-altitude, long-endurance unmanned air system design recently acquired from Qinetiq, and believes a niche market exists for the product.

Referring to the solar-powered Zephyr as a “high-altitude pseudo-satellite”, Jens Nielsen, head of unmanned aerial systems for Airbus Defence & Space’s Military Aircraft unit, says a production version could perform tasks as a communications relay and persistent surveillance asset in the future.

The Zephyr 7 airframe acquired from Qinetiq (file image shown above) has a payload capacity of 5-10kg (11-22lb), but Nielsen notes: “We have a roadmap to increase this payload – this is why we are building a Zephyr 8, and then we will build a generation-one [UAV] thereafter.”

Recent supporting work has included testing the aircraft’s communications fit and electro-optical sensor, he adds, with Airbus having drawn on its satellite production experience to minimise the volume and weight required to house key equipment. The UAV currently has a 23m wingspan, and a take-off weight of only 100kg.

Speaking in Seville, Spain, Nielsen adds that Airbus is intending to better the 14-day flight endurance record so far achieved with the Zephyr aircraft. The company acquired the design in 2013 after several years of work and testing performed by the UK technology company.

A quarter-scale prototype of SpacePlane, a vehicle being developed by the France-based company Airbus, took to the skies last month, giving engineers their first look at how the craft performs in the air.

""Held on 1-4 May, the tests of Airbus Defence and Space's SpacePlane demonstrator validated the dynamic flight conditions encountered in the end-of-flight phase following a return from space,"" Airbus representatives wrote in a June 4 statement.

During the tests, a helicopter lifted the 15-foot-long (4.6 meters) demonstrator vehicle off a boat, which was stationed 62 miles (100 kilometers) off the coast of Singapore. The chopper carried the unmanned SpacePlane mockup to an altitude of about 10,000 feet (3,000 m), at which point the craft was released to glide back down to Earth.

""It was then piloted from the barge as it made its return to the ground, ending its flight at sea before being picked up as planned a few hours later,"" Airbus representatives wrote.

Airbus has been working on SpacePlane for nearly a decade but has said very little about the project publicly. In 2007, the firm — then known as the European Aeronautic Defence and Space company (EADS) — revealed that the ""space jet"" would take off like an airplane and carry four passengers up to an altitude of 62 miles.

The space plane project would cost about 1 billion euros ($1.35 billion at current exchange rates), EADS representatives said in 2007. The firm did not plan to operate the vehicle but instead intended to sell it to tourism companies. Seat prices would be at least $200,000, according to estimates at the time.

The SpacePlane demonstrator, which was built for Airbus by Singapore firm Hope Technik, should get another set of workouts next year. Airbus officials said earlier this year that they planned to conduct drop tests from 100,000 feet (30,000 m) in 2015 using a stratospheric balloon if the May flights went well.

Airbus isn't the only company developing a suborbital space plane. Virgin Galactic's six-passenger SpaceShipTwo, for example, has already completed three powered flight tests and may be flying customers by the end of the year. Lynx, a one-passenger vehicle being built by XCOR Aerospace, could be up and running at around the same time.

Muti-Function People Mover - Vertical Magazine,"Fri, 13 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL211dGlmdW5jdGlvbnBlb3BsZW1vdmVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If you go to Provence, in the south of France, you’ll surely want to go sightseeing. A tour by air is my recommendation. Coincidentally, that’s where Airbus Helicopters builds the EC130 T2, and where Vertical Magazine was invited to test fly the latest variant of the utilitarian light single-engine helicopter. The flight revealed that, while the EC130 T2 takes aim mainly at the aerial tourism market, it is a versatile multi-function flying machine.

CUSTOMER-FOCUSED DESIGN

There is no doubt that the Ecureuil family of helicopters, most often called “AStars” in North America, has been a phenomenal success for Airbus Helicopters (the company formerly known as Eurocopter). The AS350, in its multiple variants, has proven an ideal recipe for a cost-effective and versatile utility light single-engine workhorse. The chameleon-like capability of the Ecureuil to morph into various specialized variants, has allowed it to service every nook and cranny of the light single-engine helicopter market. The latest member of the Ecureuil family, the EC130, is a wide-body variant that was introduced in 1999. It is certified to Joint Aviation Requirements Part 27 regulations for day/night visual flight rules.

In response to customer feedback, Airbus Helicopters revealed the EC130 T2 — an updated version of the light single — at Helicopter Association International’s Heli-Expo 2012 in Dallas, Texas. The T2 incorporates a more powerful engine, upgraded gearbox, active vibrations control, and improved environmental control system, as well as other advancements. Although the T2 looks identical to the earlier EC130, Airbus Helicopters claims that 70 percent of the structure has been modified. First flight of the EC130 T2 was in 2011, and deliveries began in October 2012. Production occurs alongside the legacy AS350, and Airbus Helicopters reports a production rate of 50 EC130 T2s in 2013, anticipated to increase to 65 machines over 2014.

Compared to its Ecureuil cousin, the AS350, the EC130 T2 affords operators a significantly larger cabin volume, which is achieved at the slight expense of cruising speed. It’s a helicopter optimized for creature comforts for those people-moving missions that benefit from internal volume and a quieter ride. Using the same Turbomeca Arriel 2D turboshaft engine, Airbus Helicopters reports that the EC130 T2 is 13 knots slower than the AS350 B3e. In exchange for those 13 knots, the EC130 T2 offers a room with a view.

The EC130 T2 can be configured in a choice of three seating configurations: a standard layout with a pilot plus six passenger seats; a club-type arrangement with the two center seats facing aft; and a higher-density installation that adds three front passenger seats beside the pilot. In the emergency medical services (EMS) configuration, the EC130 can accommodate two stretcher patients and two medical attendants.

HIGH-TECH SIMPLICITY

The EC130 T2 shows its common lineage with the Ecureuil family in that they are based on the same fuselage, tail boom, Starflex rotor system and gearbox. Similar in design, but differing in the details, the EC130 design distinguishes itself with a Fenestron anti-torque rotor and a big glass-enclosed cabin. It incorporates a well proven dual hydraulic system design borrowed from the AS355, and features an upgraded and, according to Airbus Helicopters, more fuel efficient Arriel 2D engine with a maximum rated power of 952 shaft horsepower. The Arriel utilizes dual-channel full-authority digital engine controls (FADEC) with analog back-up.

The requirement for enhanced passenger ride quality was addressed by the Active Vibration Control System (AVCS), which consists of five accelerometers and four linear actuators that serve to create “anti-vibration” to smooth the ride at the rotor’s “three per rev” frequency. I was surprised to find it onboard a light single, where engineers scramble for every pound of useful load, and anything that detracts from that key performance parameter has to justify the increased mass, cost and complexity. The presence of AVCS speaks of the passenger focus of the EC130 T2 design, where the comfort of the occupants is evidently a principal driver of the design.

Air conditioning is a common option on the EC130 T2, to ensure a comfortable ride under all that glass.

Further to the passenger-focused design, a greatly reduced noise signature is the reason why the Fenestron found favor over the conventional tail rotor on the AS350. The enclosed-fan Fenestron is typically quieter than a tail rotor, although incrementally heavier. Clever engineers reduced the noise signature further with asymmetric blade spacing.

SIGHTSEEING IS BELIEVING

My introduction to the EC130 T2 occurred during a test flight conducted at the Airbus Helicopters flight test center at Marignane, France. I had the privilege of flying with test pilot Eric Vincent.

Our pre-flight inspection revealed impressive attention to detail in the accessibility of the components for inspection and servicing. The distinctive aft crosstube fairing improves Dutch roll characteristics, according to Vincent. The three-bladed Starflex rotor system on the Ecureuil is elegantly simple. Access for passengers and crew is ideal. Left and right sliding doors and skid-mounted boarding steps provide comfortable access to cabin seating, while large cockpit doors accommodate the crew. In the pleasant absence of a door frame, with both cockpit and sliding door open, the entire side of the EC130 T2 fuselage is unobstructed. Easy access and a flat cabin floor are sure to please emergency medical service operators.

The brand new EC130 T2 demonstrator, French registration F-WWPI, had an empty weight of 3,159 pounds (1,433 kilograms). Adding 397 lb. (180 kg) of humans and 505 lb. (229 kg) of fuel (roughly half the 937 lb./425 kg usable fuel capacity) brought the gross weight to 4,061 lb. (1,842 kg), well short of the 5,512 lb. (2,500 kg) maximum weight (6,724 lb./3,050 kg with external loads). Our fuel loading would have allowed us to fill the remaining seats with standard sized humans, and retain 525 lb. (238 kg) additional payload. It was a perfect autumn day in Provence, if I may gloat, with calm winds, sunny skies and a temperature of 46 F (8 C).

Interestingly, the pilot-in-command flies the EC130 T2 from the left seat; a feature that allows passengers to embark without climbing over the collective if dual controls are installed. Generously surrounded by so much glass, the view is excellent from every seat.

When it’s time to start a helicopter, law enforcement and EMS missions come to mind, where seconds count and simplicity of operation is crucial. Attention to detail was evident in things like the simple collective down-lock and the electrical interlock that prevents engine starting unless the rotor brake is stowed. Starting the EC130 T2’s Arriel 2D engine was painless, and even upon first exposure the instrumentation was straightforward. Three overhead pushbuttons made quick work of systems checks, highlights of which included the caution panel, FADEC and hydraulic servos. I added one item to the pre-takeoff check: a reminder to my Canadian-trained feet that this is a European collective-requires-right-pedal machine.

Lifting from our parking spot, I found fairly extensive right pedal was required in the hover; a typical Fenestron characteristic in my experience. In partial compensation, right pedal displacement signals the FADEC to command a slight increase in rotor speed, thereby increasing Fenestron authority. Similarly, rotor speed is governed in proportion to torque, increasing from 378 revolutions per minute (r.p.m.) at flight idle on the ground to 394 r.p.m. at maximum continuous power, neatly providing the most anti-torque authority when you use the most torque. FADEC facilitates such sophistication, wherein in lieu of governing the rotor at a fixed speed, the rotor can be governed at the optimal speed for the conditions.

A SQUIRREL BY NATURE

Despite its differences, the EC130 T2 is still a member of the Ecureuil family, and its handling exemplifies how it earned the French moniker “Squirrel.” It veritably scampers in response to cyclic inputs. I found the control response tight and pleasant, sensitive but well damped; although the slightly lively gust response might keep pilots busy in turbulent conditions. No stability augmentation system (SAS) is available on the EC130 T2, and I agree that none is required.

A lively departure from Marignane into a 1,200 foot/minute climb at 80 knots took only 60 percent power, giving the feeling that there was a generous power margin. Although designed with passengers in mind, the pilot certainly benefits from all that glass. The field of view was excellent in every direction.

One feature on the EC130 T2 that was immediately appreciated was the Meggitt Avionics Vehicle and Engine Management Display (VEMD), which is a duplex color liquid crystal display in the center instrument panel. The major innovation of the VEMD is the first limit indicator (FLI) which synthesizes the engine data — N1 speed, turbine outlet temperature and torque — and presents the percentage of available power being demanded with respect to whichever parameter is limiting under the current conditions. It’s a big, round analog presentation which makes interpretation effortless. The FLI is a great example of how the outcome of sophisticated design can be apparent simplicity.

We cruised a few miles north of Marignane to a small grass airport where I could play… um, I mean, conduct a technical assessment of the EC130 T2’s flying qualities. On approach to the grass field I remarked about the low vibration characteristics throughout the flight envelope. Both at cruise speed and through translational lift to the hover I found it exemplary for a helicopter of this class. Likewise, the interior noise level was pleasantly low. I could safely assume that the exterior noise level was similarly low, as Airbus Helicopters reports that the EC130 T2 meets the stringent noise requirements of Grand Canyon National Park. The low noise signature is another happy outcome of the automatic variable rotor speed, which is becoming fashionable on FADEC-controlled helicopters.

I indulged myself with another look at the hover handling qualities. There was sufficient control power to make flying to an estimated 30 knots lateral and aft velocity a piece of cake. The robust control margins and excellent ride quality at those conditions inclined me to think that the machine was capable of much more. I later learned that the low airspeed flight envelope is indeed larger, being defined by those conditions of airspeed, power setting and load factor that illuminate the “LIMIT” light on the VEMD. What could be simpler?

At the edge of the grass airfield I found an abandoned vehicle and transitioned to a high hover to pretend to lift a sling load from its trunk. The simulated external load exercise demonstrated an additional benefit of the pilot-on-the-left seating arrangement, wherein vertical reference hovering is facilitated by flying while leaning out over the collective, rather than away from it. Once again, the excellent field of view was appreciated.

The power required to hover out of ground effect was 55 percent at our light weights, decreasing to 49 percent in ground effect. The handling grew noticeably “squirrelier” as we descended into ground effect (but perhaps that’s why they called it a “squirrel”). I experimented with aggressive pedal inputs, simulating pilot response to gusts, and found that I could induce no more than about a ten percent torque spike with the pedals. In all, the EC130 T2 inspired confidence as a responsive and capable light helicopter.

The EC130 T2 is an interesting hybrid design. It leverages upon the decades-old success of the utilitarian Ecureuil family, while bringing new technology to bear upon a specific market sector. Aerial tourism companies demanded a helicopter with a spacious cabin and a comfortable ride, but operators will find those attributes beneficial for a diverse range of missions. The EC130 T2 is a winning combination; simple to operate and pleasant to fly."

Rolls-Royce is set to take a multi-billion pound hit after Dubai's Emirates Airlines cancelled an order for 70 Airbus A350s in an unexpected blow for the jet engine maker.

Shares in Rolls-Royce, which makes engines for the aircraft, fell 2 per cent in early trading as the City digested the news. The loss of the contract will result in a £2.6 billion reduction in its order book.

Emirates placed the order as part of a wider deal with Airbus in 2007, with deliveries due from 2019, but cancelled citing ""on-going discussions with the airline in light of their fleet requirement review"".

Rolls-Royce said it was ""disappointed"", but remains ""confident"" that the delivery spot vacated by Emirates will be taken up by another airline. The jet engine maker insisted that the interest in the A350 has always been ""very high"" with more than 700 aircraft and 1,400 Trent XWB engines already sold.

Last February, Rolls-Royce stunned investors after it warned that decade of profit growth would come to a shuddering halt this year, citing defence budget cuts and the completion of export programmes to the Middle East and India."

PARIS (AP) -- Emirates Airlines has cancelled its order for 70 Airbus A350 aircraft, a blow to the manufacturer that has seen its share price sink 4 percent in morning trading.

The A350 is intended as Airbus' best hope for catching up in the long-haul market that is dominated by Boeing's 777 and 787 but has been plagued by years of delays and a multibillion dollar revamp.

In Wednesday's announcement, the companies said Emirates cancelled the order after a ""fleet requirement"" review. The carrier is owned by the government of Dubai and is by far the largest in the Mideast.

Emirates has been rapidly adding the Boeing 777 to its fleet, and last year placed an order for 150 of the planned 777x model in a deal valued at $55.6 billion."

Airbus has gathered all its engineers and designers under one roof on a site where aerodynamics was pioneered, and has big plans for updating its technology

On a radiant day in Bristol, the sun pours like honey through the stained-glass windows of Pegasus House, bathing the zodiac symbols on the floor of the listed art deco building in light. The windows celebrate the once-resident pioneers in aerodynamics – an endeavour that continues on the Filton site – with illuminated brown-and-gold biplanes and aviators arising next to a spiral staircase, and dating back to the dawn of the aerospace industry in the city.

The building, which now houses many of Airbus’s back-office functions in Britain, and sits adjacent to a sleek modern building in which the company’s teams of engineers are based, was not always in such good nick. Left empty for years, it was a site prone to vandalism, raves and squatting. Indeed, the grade II-listed structure, otherwise known as New Filton House, which opened in 1936, had been left derelict for 20 years before reopening in September last year.

The celebratory mosaic in the main entrance vestibule, featuring a sun, winds and the 12 signs of the zodiac, and picked out in German silver and inlaid in marble, was designed by sculptor Denis Dunlop and seems ironic in intention: the French Zodiac plane was a design that Sir George White of the Bristol Aeroplane Company first intended for production, having acquired the UK manufacturing rights, but the plan flopped.

Across the way from the refurbished building is the new Barnwell House, where more than 2,000 Airbus engineers and designers are situated. It is a large, modern, open-plan office space created for Airbus’s operations in Britain, and purpose-built to house the engineering teams – previously situated in various locations throughout the existing Filton site – under one roof. At the time of delivery, the project was the third largest Airbus construction scheme in the world, according to contractor Miller Construction.

Rob Kay, the engineer now responsible for landing gear for single-aisle aircraft, has also been involved in developing ‘sharklets’ – new winglets intended to boost the performance of the revamped fleet workhorse, the A320, which came into service in 1988 and has an economic and environmentally friendly ‘new engine option’ (NEO). Airbus is offering customers for future A320s a choice of new engines, including one from the CFM International joint venture between General Electric and Snecma, called Leap-1A, and another from Pratt & Whitney – the PW1100G-JM. With the sharklets, the new engines will burn around 16% less fuel, it is claimed. Airbus is targeting 2015 as the first delivery for a re-engined A320. The aircraft family competes, or has competed with, the Boeing 737, 717, 757, and the McDonnell Douglas MD-80/MD-90. The design is popular with low-cost airlines such as EasyJet, and with full-service carriers such as British Airways.

Kay, who has been with Airbus since 2000, welcomes the new working arrangements at Filton’s Barnwell House, which features engineering teams for wing and landing gear design and integration, fuel systems, and structures physics and testing. “We have all the engineering teams here now, from leading gear to fuel. Formerly, we were everywhere: if you wanted to see an expert, first you’d have to get an appointment – and then get on the bus. Now you can just wander downstairs and bump into people.”

Single-aisle Airbus aircraft rely on Messier Dowty to supply the main landing gear, which in turn has a supply chain of its own feeding the firm’s Gloucester operation. “The focus for Airbus is on integrating components and systems from other suppliers. That is where we add value. We will verify the landing gear systems and landing gear itself, and make sure that it functions,” says Kay. “Airbus is at the top of a pyramid of companies. Major structural components or systems can be made in the supply chain. Essentially, our specialism is in overall engineering integration.”

Where landing gear is concerned, progress is incremental rather than revolutionary. For example, A350 landing gear features a double-sided stay – lateral struts extending fore and aft of the main leg – which reinforces the gear to absorb the high loads otherwise transmitted to parts of the plane’s composite structure, says Kay.

Testing landing gear components is part of the job of Steve Raynes, head of the structures test centre at Filton. His team will simulate the load on landing gear fuse pins over tens of thousands of flight cycles. They test everything from individual fasteners, coupons, or material test samples, to winglets, right up to complete wings, for both new programmes and existing aircraft.

“The aim is very high reliability,” says Kay. For example, one measure is technical faults that cause a service to be delayed by 15 minutes. Very few flights are delayed for that reason, he says. “Of single-aisle aircraft, one is taking off or landing about every two seconds: to have two in 1,000 delayed because of technical reasons is phenomenal. It’s a great performance – but the airlines always want more.”

We clamber up and down ladders to see the test rigs in action, testing complete components such as sharklets, or smaller parts of airliner skin. Of the 16% improvement in fuel burn touted for the new-engine A320, about 4% might come from the winglet, and the remainder from the new CFM or Pratt & Whitney gas turbine. Winglets essentially ‘fool’ the wing into having a greater span, which cuts down on drag while allowing the plane to fit into the gate at an airport, which stands at a maximum of 38m for a single-aisle aircraft, says Kay. For the twin-deck A380, the plane had to fit into an 80m span, however.

The test rigs feature a mixture of bespoke and off-the-shelf technology, and Filton’s sprawling complex of buildings also includes a wind tunnel. “There was a point when people were talking about computational fluid dynamics replacing wind-tunnel testing,” says Kay. “In the end, you have to validate the virtual model in reality.”

Raynes says that other methodologies for testing aircraft components are also under investigation, including digital image correlation and photoelasticity – a full-field technique for measuring stress and strain that relies on a material’s ability to bend light as it passes through it. Areas of strain on a given component show up as purple on an isochromatic map. “The idea is that you identify points of stress and strain and optimise your design accordingly,” he says. The photoelasticity phenomenon was first demonstrated by Scottish physicist David Brewster in the

early 19th century.

Among other tests being simulated are the deformation of aircraft wings in the event of a tyre bursting and fragments striking them. To carry out this type of work, the test centre uses strain gauges, which rely on many kilometres of cabling stretching back to a central control room. However, the centre is exploring wireless alternatives, says Raynes. The test system is powered by hydraulic fluid driven by high-

pressure pumps, which work at about 3,000psi (20.69MPa). Many thousands of loads on a component are simulated, mimicking its in-flight life. It is hoped that physical testing will correlate with finite element analysis models.

To simulate bird strikes or tyre impacts, the centre uses a compressed air ‘gun’. Samples might travel at 25m/s. “Test is a fast-moving environment,” says Raynes. Other experiments are less fast-paced: for example, monitoring crack deformation in a sample, where tiny saw-tooth marks are made and then allowed to grow. “We plot the deformation of the sample, and then enable the part to be designed with what we call ‘crack stoppers’ as well,” he says. Ultrasonic testing can be used to measure deformation in a material by timing how long it takes for an ultrasonics wave to travel back to an oscilloscope.

The process begins with testing the smallest possible item, or material ‘coupon’ sample, and works its way up to an entire wing, for example. Even if you know the fatigue life of a certain material, designing in features such as corners changes the way it performs under stress, says Raynes. “You need to verify the designer’s intentions. We are putting real aircraft loads on to be representative of flight conditions.” For example, landing-gear pins have to be sturdy but also sensitive. “The pins have to be strong enough to sustain the ultimate landing case but, should you ever get in a crash scenario, they have to detach safely. There’s only a 5% margin involved.”

As well as wireless connections to strain gauges, other applications of modern technology inform aspects of work at the Filton test site, including robotics. Kuka robots have been employed to test robotic techniques for composite lay-ups, says Raynes.

Automation, for so long the province of the car industry, is beginning to make stronger inroads into aerospace, says Colin Mitchell, one of the engineers at Filton responsible for research and technology programmes. At the recent Mach machine tool show, for example, a robot specifically designed to deal with some of the intense manual work found in wing manufacture was demonstrated by Japanese company Fanuc, although it is not working with Airbus currently. “We are doing a lot of work with automation, mostly to assist the worker – not replace them,” says Mitchell.

Wings, for instance, require thousands of holes to be drilled. Today, semi-automated drilling units are used. But the end operator still has to position these using templates, before the drilling takes place. The speed and feed to the drill is controlled by the unit, but the positioning process could cause strain injuries for the operator, so “there is scope to improve quality”, he says. “Automation could play a part here in terms of positioning. Another area where it could help is in handling of large panels.”

The onus is on Airbus in ensuring that human beings and their potential robot co-workers get along on the shopfloor, says Mitchell. “We can’t just introduce robots into the worker manufacturing environment. We need systems where automation recognises the human element; mobile robotics have to be able to recognise a human as such as opposed to a stationary object, and take a different path. Even if a person walks toward them, it has to always move and change direction.”

Another key area of research for Airbus is the development of composites and methods of composites manufacture, where the primary driver is to reduce cost. The company is already flying additive-layer-manufactured (ALM) components on test aircraft. Its 3D printing innovation centre is based at Filton. But it will be a while before ALM components are used routinely, Mitchell believes. “It will be three to five years before such parts are being used in the mainstream.”

The entire industrial process at Airbus’s plant at Broughton in North Wales, which makes wings for every family of Airbus aircraft, is being reviewed, says Mitchell – because if capacity at the site could be expanded, then the work is out there. “Our advance orderbook is unprecedented in most industries. If we can make productivity improvements with an industrial system with a high degree of automation, we would consider it. We are very busy on single-aisle.”



Airbus is making around 40 single-aisle aircraft a month, but Kay believes the firm needs to ramp up to 50 or more to take advantage of demand. “We can anticipate a rate of 60 single-aisle aircraft a month in the future,” says Mitchell. Learning from the car industry will be important, so Airbus is looking at a partnership with a UK-based automotive OEM.

Mitchell is involved in the new Catapult technology and innovation centres, which he compares favourably with Germany’s long-established innovation powerhouses, the Fraunhofer institutes. He is a member of the advanced design and manufacturing Catapult, and says he has been impressed by government commitments to the aerospace sector, including the Aerospace Technology Institute programme, which is worth £2 billion over the life of the next parliament. Airbus is already working with the institute on several projects, he says. “The government is starting to develop this in a strategic manner – and I don’t see that happening to the same extent elsewhere in Europe.”

Key employer wins accolade for enterprise

Around 100,000 jobs are sustained by Airbus’s activities in the UK. Including those working for suppliers, more than 4,000 people are involved in design, engineering and business support roles in Bristol. Filton is responsible for the wing assembly and equipping of the A400M military transport, while Airbus’s production facility at Broughton, North Wales, assembles the wings for all Airbus civil aircraft.

The site at Broughton employs more than 6,000 people, primarily in manufacturing and engineering. After assembly, the wings for the A380 are transported by road and then river craft to Mostyn Harbour, where they are loaded on a ferry for transport to France. Broughton has also produced the De Havilland Comet and Mosquito.

Airbus won a Queen’s Award for Enterprise in April. The company received the Queen’s Award for International Trade for ‘outstanding overseas sales growth over the last three years’. Aside from exports, the company was recognised by the awards panel for understanding and anticipating the future needs of customers and environmental issues.

The British aerospace industry is recognised as being the second largest by value globally after that of the US. Airbus tries to locate as many operations as possible in US dollar-denominated economies, to insulate the firm against currency movements. Aircraft are priced in US dollars. Based on current orders, 10 years’ work is estimated to be in the pipeline for British aerospace firms. Initiatives to help British suppliers prepare for increasing global competition in the civil aviation market have been set up, such as Sharing in Growth, which is led by Rolls-Royce. Figures from aerospace and defence association ADS show a year-on-year increase in airline deliveries. April data revealed a record first quarter for aircraft deliveries in 2014, it says. In the first three months of the year, 302 single-aisle and widebody aircraft were delivered – a 35% increase on the first quarter in 2011, and 7.5% more than in the same period last year.

The figures put the global industry in a strong position, with experts predicting that the order backlog will continue to grow, says ADS. “The first quarter of 2014 has set a new record for aircraft and engine deliveries, offering a strong foundation for the year ahead and confirming significant UK growth for this global industry,” it said.

“Aerospace manufacturers are working hard to respond to the current and projected increase in demand. The Aerospace Industrial Strategy and the Aerospace Growth Partnership are helping to secure investment in technology, skills and facilities to improve efficiency and access opportunities in markets around the world.”

Record interest in airshow

Farnborough International has said it has confirmed a “record number of requests” to exhibit at the forthcoming airshow. As PE went to press, more than 70 aircraft were confirmed as part of the static line-up and a further 23 for the flying display.

The show, in Hampshire, will feature several Farnborough firsts, from the F-35 Lightning and Textron Airland Scorpion to classics such as the ME262 and the Spanish Navy’s Sea Harrier.

The theme for this year’s show is ‘100 years of aviation’. It will feature aircraft from every decade of the past century. A performance by the Great War Display team will commemorate the 100th anniversary of the start of the First World War.

A new feature of the static display will be the vintage aircraft collection tent.

The airshow runs from 14 to 20 July."

America Azul represents the first of the Azul long haul fleet, initially to be made up of six Airbus A330s, with A350s to follow.

The delivery is a bit early, as Azul is not due to ramp up A330 long haul services until December. This is due to aircraft reconfiguration as well as crew familiarisation with the type of aircraft – bear in mind that Azul has only operating Embraer E-Jets and ATR Turboprops so far.

Plan call for the aircraft to operate from Viracopos-Campinas International airport to Fort Lauderdale, Orlando and New York as the fleet size increases

The Airbus A350s will arrive in 2017 if all goes to plan.

The planes of the future will have zones dedicated to relaxing and playing games, panoramic windows and seats that collect our body heat to power in-cabin features, according to Airbus.

Predicting what travel will be like in 2050, the plane manufacturer said passengers will be able to relax in massage seats that also serve drinks and vitamins as needed and provide either a sea breeze or a scent of fresh pine.

And sound showers will ease passengers into the perfect sleep, snug in the warm embrace of special shades to keep out the light.



Flying high: The 360-degree views from the plane means passengers will be able to spot top sights when flying over land

For those who prefer a view, the plane will be made up of panoramic windows, which can become transparent at the wave or a hand or remain opaque in certain areas thanks to an integrated neural network which can detect and respond to the specific needs of each passenger.

The cabin's bionic structure will be based on the bone structure of a bird to keep it light but strong.



It would then be coated with a biopolymer membrane, which controls the amount of natural light, humidity and temperature, providing opacity or transparency on command and eliminating the need for windows.



Have fun: The games area will allow passengers to play virtual golf and tennis to while away their time on board

The resulting 360-degree view of the skies means that will offer views of the wonders of the five continents, with passengers able to look down on attractions like the Eiffel Tower.



And the fittings and furnishings will take care of their own cleaning and repairs thanks to innovations inspired by nature, like dirt repellent coatings and self healing covers.

The prediction by Airbus were in response to a global passenger survey, asking travellers what they would expect from a flight in 2050.

Heating things up: The seats on the 2050 plane will harvest body heat to power different elements of the cabin

Sleek design: The transparent plane will give perfect views of surroundings, but with an option to make certain areas more 'opaque' to enable privacy and less light to filter in

A third of the people that took part in the survey said that they would want the flight itself to feel like a holiday experience and to be able to access all the technological advances which fill their daily lives during the flight.



In the future, technology and virtual reality will be seamlessly integrated with our normal lives, services will be individually tailored and environmental needs will be addressed in everything that we do. All of which will be just as true in the air as it is on the ground.



First, Business and Economy class will be replaced by zones that target more individual needs like relaxing, playing games, interacting with other passengers or holding business meetings with people on the ground.

Social space: Planes in the future will have more recreational areas like bars so passengers can socialise

Back to work: Pop-up meeting rooms will also mean employees can continue working and even having meetings with people on the ground during the flight

Bars will also be more prevalent on flights, creating sociable areas, while p op-up pods will offer more private spaces that can be used for anything from virtual business meetings or lectures to a romantic meal or reading a bedtime story to the kids back home.



A virtual shopping wall will also project clothes directly on to passengers and the virtual gaming wall will let tennis, baseball and even golf fans get in a bit of practice, while the more adventurous will be able to try out newer options like Airbus Fusion Ball game, which lets you play catch across the skyscrapers of New York or the peaks of the Himalayas.



Airbus research also suggests that every flight in the world could on average be around 13 minutes shorter, saving around nine million tonnes of excess fuel annually, which equates to over 28 million tonnes of avoidable CO2 emissions and a saving for passengers of over 500 million hours of excess flight time on board an aircraft."

Paris: Europe’s Airbus lost a major order on Wednesday when Dubai’s Emirates airline cancelled its entire purchase of 70 Airbus A350 jets, dealing an unexpected blow to the planemaker and engine maker Rolls-Royce.

The decision cuts the order book for the European company’s newest jet, which is due to enter service in around six months’ time, by around 10 percent.

Airbus said it followed a “fleet requirement review” as Emirates shifts towards the large A380 superjumbo, for which it is the biggest customer.

Emirates was among the first buyers for the A350 rival model to Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner when it placed the order for 50 A350-900 and 20 A350-1000 jets in 2007.

The deal was worth around $16 billion at 2007 list prices - or close to $22 billion based on the current catalogue - although launch customers typically negotiate discounts.

Emirates was due to start taking deliveries of the A350 in 2019. The first A350 is due to be delivered to Qatar Airways in the fourth quarter of this year.

“We are confident that we will sell the (production) slots in the coming months,” an Airbus spokesman said. “There’s no impact on the programme as deliveries were scheduled to start at the end of the decade.”

Airbus shares were down 3.3 pct in early trading in Frankfurt, with the news expected to cast a shadow over two days of briefings for the media at Airbus’ headquarters in Toulouse on Wednesday and Thursday.

Emirates has been pushing for Airbus to upgrade the A380 superjumbo with a more efficient engine, after increasing its total orders for the world’s biggest passenger jet by 50 in November to 140 planes.

The carrier’s chief executive, Tim Clark, said earlier this month that a revamped A380 could have a 10-12 percent performance improvement and that “we are hoping to move on that pretty soon”.

Emirates is also in the process of firming up an order for 150 of Boeing’s latest jetliner, the 777X mini-jumbo, of which Emirates has ordered 150 worth $76 billion at list prices.

Asked about the A350 order cancellation on Wednesday, an Emirates spokesman said: “The contract which we signed in 2007 for 70 A350 aircraft has lapsed. We are reviewing our fleet requirements.”

Airbus said in a statement that it remained “very confident” in the A350 programme and that it expected the A350 order book to grow in 2014.

Britain’s Rolls-Royce, which is the sole engine maker for the A350, said the Emirates decision would result in a 2.6 billion pound ($4.4 billion) hit to its order book.

“While disappointed with this decision, we are confident that the delivery slots which start towards the end of this decade vacated by Emirates will be taken up by other airlines,” Rolls-Royce said in a statement.

It remains unclear whether Airbus will officially unveil the new project at the world's premier aviation event, since it usually waits to secure orders first.Purchasing decisions are expected this year from some potential launch customers such as Delta Air Lines, which is currently replacing Boeing 767 and 747 jets.Airbus, which has promised investors a decision before the end of the year on whether to revamp the 253- to 295-seat A330 passenger jet, said none had been taken so far.""We will have a comment when we have a decision. There is no decision yet,"" a spokesman said.Rolls-Royce said it was ""not aware"" of a final A330 decision having been reached, and that any announcement would come from Airbus. GE reiterated it had offered its GEnX engine for the revised jet, but declined to comment on the commercial talks.The A330 entered service 20 years ago and for years had looked set to be overtaken by a new generation of carbon-composite jets such as the 787 Dreamliner and soon the Airbus A350.But following a three-year delay to the 787's arrival, sales of the A330 held up much better than expected.Now, however, the backlog of undelivered aircraft is dwindling rapidly as the 787 recovers momentum, and Airbus is keen to inject new life into its most profitable wide-body jet.The Airbus-Rolls partnership raises the prospect of a potentially bruising transatlantic battle for sales at the lower end of the market for wide-body jets, which ranges from the 230- to 250-seat A330-200 and 787-8 to the 525-seat A380 superjumbo.Airbus has said it will offer the refreshed A330 at significantly lower prices than the 787 and match the newer plane's performance per seat on most routes.Boeing denies this but is preparing to put up a fight, with its sales chief telling Reuters this month that it would ""react"" to the relaunch of the A330.Industry experts have speculated that Boeing could respond by changing its one-size-fits-all 787 pricing strategy by offering different prices for different levels of performance - a move seen as a form of discounting.But the U.S. planemaker is also expected to look just as hard at ways of increasing availability of the 787, which is mostly sold out until around the end of the decade. Boeing produces 10 787s a month but targets output of 14 a month by end-decade.The 787 is powered by engines from Rolls or GE, but industry sources say GE is now expected to be more proactive in cutting deals with airlines that help Boeing compete with the A330neo.Both planemakers will be under pressure from investors to prevent the contest developing into a price war that might destabilise wider pricing and undermine profitability goals.The A330neo will be launched in two versions, updating the A330-200 and A330-300. One casualty will be the smallest member of the Airbus A350 family, the slow-selling 270-seat A350-800.The re-engined A330 is accordingly expected to be marketed as the entry point for Airbus's wide-body portfolio, prompting some in the industry to give it a different name: the A350-200/300."
Commercial aerospace puts Hexcel on growth path - Reinforced Plastics,"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlaW5mb3JjZWRwbGFzdGljcy5jb20vY29udGVudC9mZWF0dXJlcy9jb21tZXJjaWFsLWFlcm9zcGFjZS1wdXRzLWhleGNlbC1vbi1ncm93dGgtcGF0aC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HM63 - Hexcel's new high modulus carbon fibre.

Helicopter part made by Airbus Helicopters with HexPly M92 125°C curing prepreg.

The thickest carbon prepreg structure ever made at 400mm thick - a carbon cube made from 695 plies of Hexcel's new HexPly M79 carbon fibre prepreg (cured in just 6 hours at 80°C).

HiTape Aircraft Fuselage panel made by Hexcel in partnership with Aerolia and Coriolis Composites.

Introducing the press conference, Nick Stanage, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President outlined the Hexcel Corporation of 2014. The company has been active in the composites market for 65 years and is now primarily focused on the aerospace and wind energy markets. Sales in 2013 were $1.68 billion, with 46% in the US, 39% in Europe and 15% elsewhere. The company has 5,300 employees, mainly split between the US and Europe. He highlighted the company’s main composite material areas of interest and applications. These included:

Carbon fibre (A350 fuselage and wings; LEAP fan blades/case; F-35 wings

Reinforcements (aircraft radomes; 787 fabric for stringers; BMW roof)

Carbon prepregs (aero primary structures; A380 central wing box; GE90 fan blade; Eurofighter wings)

Glass prepregs (wind blades; wing-to-body fairings in aero)

Honeycombs (helicopter blades; aircraft flooring; nacelle structures; Acousti-Cap ® )

) Engineered products (structural assemblies; HexMC® materials; Machined Core; HexTool® Tooilng System)

Commercial aerospace accounts for 65% of the company’s business, with space and defence at 22%. Industrial applications (wind energy, recreation and transportation) accounting for 13%. Hexcel reports strong global demand in the commercial aircraft sector. There is a backlog of more than 10,000 planes at Airbus and Boeing or around 8 years estimated at 2013 deliveries. Last year was a record year for deliveries and 2014 is expected to be so as well. Hexcel adds that the introduction of these composite intensive aircraft now means that it is supplying around $5 million worth of materials for the Airbus A350, for example. Thierry Merlot, VP and General Manager then summarised the A350XWB and LEP-1 programmes. With the maiden flight taking place in June last year, flight tests have been progressing well. At the end of January there were 814 orders from 39 companies. Hexcel’s content on the A350 includes: radome; passenger doors; nacelle structure; wing and horizontal stabiliser; fuselage; fuselage – Section 19/19.1; wing leading and trailing edges; ailerons; wing covers; and belly fairing. On CFM’s LEAP-1 engine, Hexcel has been awarded the long term contract by Safran to supply all the carbon fibre for the fan blades and containment cases. HexTow® IM7 fibre was selected for its high tensile strength and modulus, and good shear strength. Hexcel will also supply Safran with HexPly® carbon prepreg for the A320neo nacelles. Finally, Paul McKenzie, VP Research & Technology highlighted Hexcel’s new products, starting with HexTow® HM63.

HexTow® HM63

Hexcel has added to its range of IM and AS fibres by launching a new high modulus carbon fibre, called HexTow® HM63. This new fibre has the highest tensile strength of any high modulus fibre and provides good translation of fibre properties in a composite, including good interlaminar shear and compression shear strength. Hexcel adds that it is therefore ideal for any high stiffness and strength-critical applications including space, satellites, UAV, commercial aerospace and helicopters. It also meets the special requirements for premium sports and recreation applications including F1, marine craft, bikes and fishing rods. At JEC Hexcel displayed a ThermoSet Carbon (TSC) cable for yacht rigging manufactured by Future Fibres, using HexTow® HM63 high modulus carbon fibre for low weight, high break strength and resistance to impact.

HexPly® M92 prepreg

Designed for aerospace structures, HexPly® M92 prepreg is claimed to combine all the major benefits achieved individually with other 125°C curing epoxy resins in one new ‘multi-purpose’ system. These benefits include good hot wet Tg performance of 115°C, allowing HexPly® M92 to operate at higher service temperatures from a lower cost 125°C cure. The system is self-adhesive to honeycomb, making it suitable for sandwich structures as well as monolithic components. Other benefits include high toughness, fire resistance, low exotherm, a long out/tack life and the ability to cure by vacuum bag. HexPly® M92 is available in a wide range of prepreg forms (woven and UD tape). At the JEC show, Hexcel displayed a Helicopter Rotor Hub Cap Fairing manufactured by Airbus Helicopters. This oven-cured part is a honeycomb sandwich structure in which the prepreg is bonded directly to the non-metallic core, without any additional adhesive. Airbus Helicopters estimates that weight savings of 8-15% will be achieved by manufacturing this part from HexPly® M92, depending on the helicopter type.

HexPly® M77 ‘Snap Cure’ prepreg

To further extend the use of thermoset resins in mass produced composite parts Hexcel has developed HexPly® M77, a rapid curing epoxy prepreg that allows automotive components and sports goods to be press-cured in a 2-minute cycle at 150°C (80 bar pressure). Hexcel says that the low tack of HexPly® M77 enables the prepreg to be cut into precise shapes by laser cutter. The individual plies can then be oriented, assembled and consolidated into a flat preform by robot. Once in the mould HexPly® M77 has an optimised gel time that allows the resin to flow into the contours to produce the precise geometries required. The high Tg of 125°C enables the cured parts to be demoulded while hot for a faster production cycle. This rapid-curing product, with a 6-week outlife at room temperature, is available in various forms including unidirectional or woven reinforcements and heavy tow fibres. It is also supplied as HexMC®, Hexcel’s high performance carbon fibre/epoxy compound developed specifically for compression moulding processes. HexMC® is ideal for the series production of complex shaped parts with thickness variation, sharp angles or parts that require inserts to be integrated into the moulding process such as screw threads.

HexPly® M79 Low Temperature Cure prepreg

HexPly® M79 Low Temperature Cure prepreg has been developed for wind blades and marine applications. Hexcel says that HexPly® M79 was developed to meet industry requirements for a faster and lower temperature curing prepreg for thick laminates. It has evolved from HexPly® M10, Hexcel’s long-established and widely used prepreg resin for marine structures and wind blades. A number of cure cycle options are possible for HexPly® M79 including a very low temperature cure of 8-10 hours at 70°C or a more rapid cure cycle of just 4-6 hours at 80°C. With previous systems it could take 10 hours to cure a laminate at 80°C. HexPly® M79 also has a very long outlife at room temperature of at least 6 weeks. When HexPly® M79 carbon fibre UD prepreg is used in conjunction with Hexcel’s patented grid technology a void content in the cured laminate of less than 1% is achievable, regardless of the part thickness. Hexcel demonstrated at JEC what the company believed to be the thickest carbon prepreg laminate ever made. The lay-up of 695 plies of HexPly® M79 600 gsm carbon UD tape with Hexcel’s grid technology is 400mm thick – and it cured in just 6 hours at 80°C. The very low exotherm of HexPly® M79 allowed the temperature to be increased more quickly in the mould, resulting in a shorter cure cycle.

HiTape® Aircraft Fuselage Panel Demonstrator

HiTape® advanced dry carbon fibre reinforcements combine the benefits of automated processing with the cost-effectiveness of Out of Autoclave infusion technologies. HiTape® allows preforms to be manufactured in a fully automated lay-up process, with high deposition rates. Parts produced with HiTape® and Hexcel’s HexFlow® infusion resins can be up to 30mm thick with a 58-60% Fibre Volume Content, resulting in mechanical properties that are as high as those achieved with primary structure prepregs. To demonstrate the potential of HiTape® for cost and cycle efficient next generation aircraft primary structures, Hexcel has worked with Aerolia SAS and Coriolis Composites to design and manufacture an aircraft fuselage panel demonstrator that was on display at JEC. Aerolia SAS is a major world player in the design and production of aircraft equipped fuselages. Coriolis Composites is a leader in the development and manufacture of automated fibre placement processes for composites. The fuselage panel is a self-stiffened skin that was designed by Aerolia to meet the mechanical performance requirements for primary structures. Coriolis Composites developed the dry Automated Fibre Placement process for the full scale fuselage skin demonstrator - and the dry preforms were made at Compositadour’s facilities. The HiTape® preform skin and stiffeners were infused with HexFlow® RTM6 resin at Hexcel’s new Applications Laboratory in Les Avenieres, close to Lyon, using a co-infusion process that was developed in-house. The resulting fuselage panel demonstrates that parts made with HiTape® and HexFlow® RTM6 meet the high mechanical performance requirements for primary structures, including toughness. Hexcel adds that HiTape® is a cost-effective, highly automated solution for the manufacture of aircraft primary structures that enables aircraft designers to meet the cost and build rate targets for next generation aircraft, while retaining the weight-saving benefits that are achieved with prepregs.

Airbus loses major order as Emirates scraps A350 purchase | Mint - Mint,"Wed, 11 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9Db21wYW5pZXMvZmdMRmZZYkY1TnFoaFFXaWFoQ1h0TC9BaXJidXMtbG9zZXMtbWFqb3Itb3JkZXItYXMtRW1pcmF0ZXMtc2NyYXBzLUEzNTAtcHVyY2hhc2UuaHRtbNIBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vQ29tcGFuaWVzL2ZnTEZmWWJGNU5xaGhRV2lhaENYdEwvQWlyYnVzLWxvc2VzLW1ham9yLW9yZGVyLWFzLUVtaXJhdGVzLXNjcmFwcy1BMzUwLXB1cmNoYXNlLmh0bWw_ZmFjZXQ9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Group NV suffered its biggest-ever order cancellation as Dubai-based airline Emirates scrapped a deal for 70 A350 aircraft valued at $16 billion, hurting efforts to break Boeing Co. ’s dominance in the wide-body aircraft market.

Emirates will drop 50 A350-900s and 20 of the larger A350-1000s, Airbus said on Wednesday. The deal was announced in 2007 and the planes were due for delivery from 2019, shortly before Boeing’s new 777X, for which the Dubai airline is the No. 1 customer.

The world’s largest carrier by international traffic reviewed its requirements after last year topping up orders for the A380 superjumbo, adding 50 more to become by far the largest operator. The surprise decision on the A350 comes with the jetliner programme just months away from commercial entry.

“The A350 is a good aircraft, its’ a clean ship, it’s cutting edge, but I don’t think the delivery schedule of the A350 fits in line with Emirates’ growth capabilities at this moment,"" said Mark D. Martin, chief executive officer of Dubai-based Martin Consulting Llc.

Airbus shares fell as much as €2.29, or 4.3%, to €51.58. The stock is down 7% this year after almost doubling in value in 2013. Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc, which makes the engines for the aircraft, declined as much as 3% in London, where the company is based.

Split Loyalties

Emirates president Tim Clark, who is equally loyal to Boeing and Airbus, had long been a critic of the A350-1000, saying the aircraft didn’t meet his specifications. Smaller regional rivals Qatar Airways Ltd. and Etihad Airways PJSC had also bemoaned the airliner, with Etihad at one stage dropping its order, only to come back last year for more.

The A350-900 typically seats 315 passengers, while the A350-1000 version can fit about 369 travellers. Airbus says the aircraft’s use of weight-saving materials and swept wings help save fuel, typically the single-biggest expense for airlines.

At the Dubai Air Show last year, Emirates said it would buy 150 777Xs, the re-engined version of the Boeing wide-body, and take out 50 options with a total value of $76 billion.

Emirates is the biggest customer for the existing 777, a twin-engine model that boasts the world’s biggest power plant and is one of the company’s best-sellers.

Filling Slots

Rolls-Royce is the sole engine provider for the A350, and the company said today that Emirates’ decision will cut its order book by £2.6 billion ($4.36 billion). Emirates doesn’t use Rolls power plants on its A380s, opting instead for the alternative Engine Alliance model that’s made by General Electric Co. and United Technologies Corp.’s Pratt & Whitney.

Rolls-Royce said it was confident the delivery slots dropped by Emirates will be taken up by other carriers, saying it was disappointed with the decision to drop the A350s.

Airbus and Boeing are the only manufacturers of wide-body aircraft, a market that’s more lucrative than the single-aisle segment because aircraft are more expensive. Customers have purchased more wide-body twin-engine airliners that are more efficient than the larger superjumbos, with both Airbus and Boeing struggling to win more customers for their largest jets.

Airbus is very confident in its A350 program, the Toulouse, France-based manufacturer said in the release. Half a year before entry into service, the A350 order book stands at a healthy 742 firm orders.

777 Strength

The A350 will enter commercial service with Qatar Airways, which remains the biggest buyer of the twin-engine jet that’s largely made of light composite materials. The airliner comes in three sizes and competes both with the Boeing 777 and the smaller 787 Dreamliner. Airbus has won by far the most orders for the mid-sized version.

While the development of the A350 has been free of major glitches for at least a year—an increasingly rare occurrence for aircraft programs—Airbus has struggled to keep the momentum particularly for the smallest variant, with customers dropping purchases to move to bigger planes. The A350-1000 staged a comeback about two years ago after an order dearth, as customers preferred Boeing’s popular 777 wide-body.

“The 777 is now increasingly becoming the mainstay fleet of Emirates,"" said Martin. “In fact, if you look at how they deploy the 777, the 777 is flying to almost all their key destinations."" Bloomberg

The A350 is intended as Airbus’ best hope for catching up in the long-haul market that is dominated by Boeing’s 777 and 787 but has been plagued by years of delays and a multibillion dollar revamp.

In Wednesday’s announcement, the companies said Emirates cancelled the order after a “fleet requirement” review. The carrier is owned by the government of Dubai and is by far the largest in the Mideast.

Emirates has been rapidly adding the Boeing 777 to its fleet, and last year placed an order for 150 of the planned 777x model in a deal valued at $55.6 billion.

Aircraft number 100 was a new Airbus A321-231, which was also joined by the 101st - an Airbus A320-200.

“This is an important day for an airline which launched operations just over 10 years ago,” said James Hogan, the president and chief executive of Etihad.

""Etihad Airways continues to grow, to prosper and to lead the way in innovation and service. Today, we fly the most technologically advanced and fuel efficient aircraft available, setting new standards in comfort and reliability.""

A statement from Etihad said that both aircraft are equipped with sharklets, which are blended winglets at each wingtip, designed to enhance the payload-range performance, allowing a significant reduction in fuel-burn.

The carrier placed its largest ever aircraft order in November at the Dubai Airshow with a value of US$67 billion for up to 199 aircraft and 294 engines. It will take delivery of its first Boeing 787-9 and Airbus A380 aircraft in October and December of this year.

Meanwhile, Etihad and Air New Zealand, which has a codeshare with Etihad, agreed to provide mutual maintenance in Melbourne, Australia, and Los Angeles in the USA.

Etihad said it will soon offer maintenance on Air New Zealand planes in Melbourne at its Tullamarine engineering facility.

Air New Zealand already provides maintenance for Etihad in Los Angeles.

The maintenance services to be performed in Melbourne and Los Angeles will possibly include: transit, daily and weekly checks, scheduled engineering services and fault repairs for the aircraft systems and passenger cabins. Etihad launched daily flights to Los Angeles on June 1.

Airbus Says Emirates Cancels Order For 70 A350 Planes - Gulf Business,"Wed, 11 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZ3VsZmJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9haXJidXMtc2F5cy1lbWlyYXRlcy1jYW5jZWxzLW9yZGVyLTcwLWEzNTAtcGxhbmVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus lost a major order on Wednesday when Dubai’s Emirates airline cancelled its entire requirement for 70 A350 jets, dealing an unexpected blow to the European planemaker and engine maker Rolls-Royce.

Shares in Airbus fell more than three per cent on the loss of some nine per cent of the order book for its newest passenger jet, which is now only months away from entering service after eight years in development at a cost of some $15 billion.

Airbus acknowledged it was disappointed with the loss of the joint second-largest customer for the new twin-engined wide-body aircraft, but said it was confident of filling the spare production slots and did not see any financial impact from the cancellation.

“It is not good news commmercially but not bad news financially,” Airbus sales chief John Leahy told reporters in Toulouse, adding Boeing has had more cancellations for its 787 Dreamliner.

“There is certainly going to be no hole in production,” Leahy said. Emirates was due to receive its first A350 in 2019.

Rolls-Royce, which is the sole engine maker for the A350, said the Emirates decision would result in a 2.6 billion-pound ($4.4 billion) hit to its order book.

“While disappointed with this decision, we are confident that the delivery slots which start towards the end of this decade vacated by Emirates will be taken up by other airlines,” Rolls-Royce said in a statement.

Airbus shares were down 3.7 per cent at 51.85 euros by 0847 GMT, while Rolls-Royce was down 1.7 per cent at 1057 pence.

Airbus said the cencellation followed a “fleet requirement review” as Emirates shifts towards the large A380 superjumbo, for which it is the biggest customer.

Emirates was among the first buyers for the A350 when it placed the order for 50 A350-900 and 20 A350-1000 jets in 2007.

The deal was worth around $16 billion according to 2007 list prices, or close to $22 billion based on the current catalogue, although launch customers typically negotiate large discounts.

The first A350 is due to be delivered to Qatar Airways in the fourth quarter of this year.

“We are confident that we will sell the (production) slots in the coming months,” an Airbus spokesman said. “There’s no impact on the programme as deliveries were scheduled to start at the end of the decade.”

Emirates said the original A350 order had lapsed and that it was reviewing its fleet requirements.

“Emirates was one of the original customers interested in the programme, but always seemed rather critical of the aircraft specifications,” Cantor Fitzgerald Europe said in a note.

Aerospace industry analyst Nick Cunningham, managing partner at UK-base Agency Partners, said the move also posed questions over whether Middle Eastern carriers have over-expanded or are expecting lower growth than before.

Airbus and Boeing have dismissed warnings of a ‘bubble’ in commercial aircraft orders, which remained robust throughout the financial crisis, but some industry bankers say airlines have ordered too many aircraft despite growth in emerging markets.

The A350 decision meanwhile increases the chances that Airbus will revamp its largest models, analysts said.

Emirates has been pushing for Airbus to upgrade the A380 superjumbo with a more efficient engine, after increasing its total orders for the world’s biggest passenger jet by 50 in November to 140 planes.

The carrier’s chief executive, Tim Clark, said earlier this month that a revamped A380 could have a 10-12 percent performance improvement and that “we are hoping to move on that pretty soon”.

The order concerns 67 A320 narrow-body jetliners and 15 twin-aisle A330s, with a list price of $6.8 billion ( ₹ 40,343 crore).

“If Kingfisher finds a new buyer for the airline that buyer would need single-aisle planes, so for that reason we’ll keep them until the airline is completely shut down,"" Kiran Rao, Airbus’s executive vice-president of sales and marketing, said in a briefing at the company’s base in Toulouse, France.

Kingfisher had debt of ₹ 9,140 crore as of 31 December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Owned by liquor baron Vijay Mallya, the Bangalore-based carrier ceased operations in 2012 and lost its flying permit after defaulting on payments to lenders, staff, airports and lessors.

Airbus, which suffered its biggest-ever order loss this week when Dubai-based airline Emirates scrapped a $16 billion deal, has already struck Kingfisher’s deal for five A380 superjumbos and the same number of A350-800 long-haul planes from its books.

Indian rules would require any successor airline to amass five years of domestic operations with at least 20 planes before commencing flights abroad, making the order redundant.

Kingfisher said in January it aimed to restart operations, though its licence will expire at the end of this year if flights don’t begin by then.

A380 Potential

Indian carriers have lost $10 billion in seven years as high fuel prices and airport charges erase earnings, according to the CAPA Center for Aviation. Malaysia-based AirAsia Bhd, Asia’s top budget carrier, began flying in India on Thursday, pressuring carriers to cut fares to keep market share.

India lifted a ban on A380s flying into the country in January, a move that could see the country become the No. 1 destination for the double-decker outside the hubs where it is based, according to Rao, with seven or eight aircraft likely to be flying there by the year’s end.

Singapore Airlines Ltd made the first commercial A380 flight to India this month, and Emirates and Deutsche Lufthansa AG are among other carriers planning to deploy the plane to the world’s second-most populous nation. Bloomberg

Airbus Helicopters in Asia : At the top of the game - Opérationnels SLDS - Opérationnels SLDS,"Sun, 08 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vb3BlcmF0aW9ubmVscy5jb20vMjAxNC8wNi8wOC9haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtaW4tYXNpYS1hdC10aGUtdG9wLW9mLXRoZS1nYW1lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Logistics support, training and maintenance constitute a really foundational element in shaping our market strategy. We have several subsidiaries already in Asia, and have more than 2000 people working on support in the region(…). An Asian country is not going to buy a defense product, which they cannot support fully.

With this kind of approach, Airbus Helicopters is likely to see its market share in Asia expand based on an already significant presence in Asia for a long time as well as the buildup of partnerships and presence overtime in the region. What is new is an expanding role in the secu- rity and defense market within Asia itself. Discussing Airbus Helicopters’ evolving role in Asia, Norbert Ducrot under- scores the significant position, which his company has in South East Asia with their light utility helicopters and their Search and Rescue Helicopters. He also highlighted the importance of the wor- king agreements with South Korea in shaping a new helicopter via production cooperation as a key change.

Building Innovative Partnerships : Surion or the largest Puma ever built

In 2006, under the Korean Utility Helicopter (KUH) program, then Eurocopter and South Korea signed an agreement to produce the Surion helicopter, in order to replace the Army and Air Force’s fleet of UH-1H attack helicopters and 500MD light helicopters. Based on the Super Puma family MK1/2 of helicopters, the Surion, as it was renamed in 2009, is able to carry up to 18 passengers.A naval and MEDEVAC variant are planned as well. The helicopter was produced through an agreement between Korean Aerospace Industries (KAI) and then Eurocopter (70-30% for the R&D phase, 60-20% for the production phase with the remaining 20% involving other companies). To be in close reach of its main customers, Airbus Helicopters from the outset created a subsidiary called KHDS based in Sacheon for technical assistance for the KUH program and in Seoul for spare parts and support service activities for its civilian products. Between its first flight in March 2010 and April 2012, 4 prototypes flew 2000 sorties and 2700 flying hours4. The first of the planned 245 Surion helicopters was successfully delivered to the ROKAA (Republic of Korea Army Aviation) in December 2012 and into service 6 months later; more than 20 were delivered by the end of 2013. It is the first indigenously built military transport helicopter in South Korea, with Airbus helicopters as the primary partner, providing the Drive System as well as the Automatic Flight Control System, i.e. the gearboxes, rotor masts, transmission and autopilot subassemblies."

Bloomberg/London/Toulouse

Airbus Group suffered its biggest-ever order cancellation as Gulf airline Emirates scrapped a deal for A350 planes valued at $16bn, hurting efforts to break Boeing’s dominance in wide-body aircraft.

Emirates will drop orders for 50 A350-900s and 20 larger -1000s, Airbus said yesterday. The deal was struck in 2007 and the planes were due for delivery from 2019, shortly before Boeing’s new 777X, for which the Dubai-based airline is the No 1 buyer.

The world’s largest carrier by international traffic reviewed its fleet requirements after last year topping up orders for the A380 superjumbo, adding 50 more to become by far the largest operator. The surprise decision on the A350 comes with the jetliner months away from entering commercial service.

“The A350 is a good aircraft, it’s a clean ship, it’s cutting edge, but I don’t think the delivery schedule of the A350 fits in line with Emirates’ growth capabilities at this moment,” said Mark D Martin, chief executive officer of Dubai-based Martin Consulting.

Airbus fell as much as €2.34, or 4.3%, to €51.53. The stock is down 7% this year after almost doubling in value in 2013. Rolls-Royce Holdings, which makes the engines for the aircraft, declined as much as 3% in London, where the company is based.

Emirates President Tim Clark, who is equally loyal to Boeing and Airbus, had long been a critic of the A350-1000, saying the aircraft didn’t meet his specifications. Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways had also bemoaned the airliner, with Abu Dhabi-based Etihad at one stage dropping its order, only to come back last year for more.

“It’s not great news,” John Leahy, the Airbus chief operating officer who is also the company’s chief salesman said at a briefing. “Tim does change his mind from time to time, so maybe we could persuade him later on to change his mind again.”

Other airlines have already contacted the Toulouse, France-based manufacturer to enquire about taking up the vacant delivery slots, Leahy said, adding that with most positions sold out through 2020 there’ll be “no trouble” selling the planes.

The A350-900 typically seats 315 passengers, while the-1000 version can fit about 369 travellers. Airbus says the aircraft’s use of weight-saving materials and swept wings help save fuel, typically the single-biggest expense for airlines.

At the Dubai Air Show last year, Emirates said it would buy 150 777Xs, the re-engined version of the Boeing wide-body, and take out 50 options with a total value of $76bn.

Emirates is the biggest customer for the existing 777, a twin-engine model that boasts the world’s biggest powerplant and is one of the Chicago-based Boeing’s bestsellers.

Yesterday’s announcement may indicate that the Gulf carrier has undertaken a fleet re-appraisal and will standardise around just the 777 and A380, said John Strickland, an aviation specialist and director of JLS Consulting Ltd in London.

Rolls-Royce is the sole engine provider for the A350, and the company said yesterday that Emirates’s decision will cut its order book by £2.6bn ($4.36bn). Emirates doesn’t use Rolls powerplants on its A380s, opting instead for the alternative Engine Alliance model that is made by General Electric Co and United Technologies Corp’s Pratt & Whitney.

Rolls-Royce said it is confident the delivery slots dropped by Emirates will be taken up by other carriers, saying it is “disappointed” with the decision to cancel the A350s.

Airbus and Boeing are the only manufacturers of twin-aisle aircraft, a market that is more lucrative than the narrow-body segment because of the higher prices and margins. Customers are largely purchasing two-engine wide-bodies that are more efficient than the larger superjumbos, with both Airbus and Boeing struggling to add customers for their largest jets.

“Airbus is very confident in its A350 program,” the company said in the release, adding that the order book stands at “a healthy 742 firm orders.”

While the planemaker would like to have Emirates as an A350 buyer, airlines are “hungry” for planes of that size and it should “pick up business elsewhere,” Strickland said.

The A350 will enter commercial service with Qatar Airways, which remains the biggest buyer of the twin-jet that is largely made of light composite materials. The airliner comes in three sizes - including the -800 with about 260 seats - and competes both with the Boeing 777 and the smaller 787 Dreamliner. Airbus has won by far the most orders for the mid-sized version."
