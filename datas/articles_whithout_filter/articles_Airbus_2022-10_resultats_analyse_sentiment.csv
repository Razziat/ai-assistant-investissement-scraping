Second Eutelsat telecommunications satellite to join its twin in orbit within a month

BelugaST fuelled with 30% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for Toulouse departure

A special aircraft landed at the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral in Florida this weekend: the Airbus BelugaST (A300-600ST). It delivered the Airbus-built HOTBIRD 13G satellite for Eutelsat. This happened a few hours after its twin, HOTBIRD 13F, was successfully launched by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.

The spacecraft are the first members of the new “Eurostar Neo” family of Airbus telecommunications satellites, based on a next-generation platform and technologies developed with the support of the European Space Agency (ESA), and others, including the Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales (CNES) and the UK Space Agency (UKSA).

This milestone also marks the first time since 2009 that the Beluga has visited the USA – when it transported the International Space Station European module “Tranquility”. For this latest mission, the Beluga used 30% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for its departure flight from Toulouse – reflecting Airbus’ decarbonisation ambitions.

“It is a true honour to consecutively showcase two satellites for our customer Eutelsat: two pieces of European technology at the iconic Kennedy Space Center,” said Jean-Marc Nasr, Head of Space Systems at Airbus. “The ability of Airbus to field an autonomous European solution is underscored by the transportation of our satellites in the unique Beluga aircraft – a true example of pan-Airbus synergies!” Beluga and Hotbird at KSC by Pléiades Neo

Once they reach their orbital position, these two satellites, with more efficient power and thermal control systems than their predecessors, will be able to broadcast more than 1,000 television channels across Europe, Northern Africa and the Middle East. They will also enhance Eutelsat’s ability to provide connectivity for more than 135 million people, as they replace three Eutelsat satellitescurrently in orbit.

With the advent of the new BelugaXL, based on the larger A330-200 platform, the existing BelugaST fleet is progressively being made available for outsized freight transport services globally. Since the launch of the new Airbus Beluga Transport service in January, the BelugaST has performed missions for various customers worldwide.

SpaceX launch to deploy first in new generation of Airbus-built satellites – Spaceflight Now - Spaceflight Now,"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VmbGlnaHRub3cuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMTQvc3BhY2V4LWxhdW5jaC10by1kZXBsb3ktZmlyc3QtaW4tbmV3LWdlbmVyYXRpb24tb2YtYWlyYnVzLWJ1aWx0LXNhdGVsbGl0ZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The first in a new line of Airbus-built communications satellites is stowed for launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket Friday night from Cape Canaveral, ready for a mission to beam hundreds of TV channels to Eutelsat customers across Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa.

The Hotbird 13F satellite is built on the new Eurostar Neo spacecraft platform designed by Airbus Defense and Space, with funding support from the European Space Agency. The Eurostar Neo satellite design can accommodate additional payload capacity, and introduces more efficient power and thermal control systems than the previous generation of Eurostar E3000 Airbus-built satellites.

“It’s a huge new product, payload centric, more competitive than anything we have ever done,” said François Gaullier, head of telecommunications satellites at Airbus. “And we are more than happy to have developed this product, of which Hotbird 13F will be the first one to be launched.”

ESA provided about 130 million euros, or $126 million at current exchange rates, to help pay for development of the new satellite platform. Airbus funded the rest of the development cost with its own money under the umbrella of a public-private partnership.

Eutelsat, a Paris-based commercial satellite operator, was the first customer to sign up to use the new Eurostar Neo spacecraft platform. The launch of Eutelsat’s Hotbird 13F will be followed in November by the launch of a nearly identical satellite for Eutelsat named Hotbird 13G.

“This Eurostar Neo satellite has been a partnership project done with Airbus, and with the first customer Eutelsat,” said Elodie Viau, ESA’s director of telecommunications and integrated applications. “This Eurostar Neo is a new set of satellites that are very competitive, that are optimized to be (cost) effective, and to use electrical propulsion in a very optimized way to allow more and more payload capacity.”

On its journey toward geostationary orbit, Hotbird 13F will use PPS5000 plasma orbit-raising thrusters developed by the French company Safran. The fuel-efficient plasma propulsion system relies on xenon gas and electricity to generate thrust, rather than a conventional liquid rocket fuel like hydrazine. That reduces the weight of the satellite, allowing engineers to launch on a smaller rocket or add additional payloads to support more communications capacity for customers.

So far, Airbus has sold eight satellites based on the new Eurostar Neo platform, including Hotbird 13F. Other customers for the Eurostar Neo satellite design include the UK Ministry of Defense, which signed a contract with Airbus to build a secure military communications satellite on the new spacecraft platform.

According to an Airbus spokesperson, Hotbird 13F weighs 9,868 pounds (4,476 kilograms) at launch. The spacecraft is cocooned inside the nose cone of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket, awaiting liftoff during a launch window opening at 11:26 p.m. EDT Friday (0326 GMT Saturday). The launch window extends until 1:22 a.m. EDT (0522 GMT).

The forecast team from the U.S. Space Force’s 45th Weather Squadron predicts a 90% chance of favorable conditions for liftoff Friday night.

The 229-foot-tall (70-meter) Falcon 9 rocket will blast off from pad 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, powered by a first stage booster making its third flight to space. Nine kerosene-fueled Merlin 1D engines will generate 1.7 million pounds of thrust for the initial lift out of Earth’s atmosphere, then a second stage with a single Merlin engine will fire two times to inject the Hotbird 13F spacecraft into an elliptical, or oval-shaped, geostationary transfer orbit.

The first stage booster will return to a landing on a SpaceX drone ship parked east of Cape Canaveral in the Atlantic Ocean.

The rocket’s payload fairing protecting the Hotbird 13F satellite will jettison about three-and-a-half minutes after blastoff, once the rocket reaches the rarefied airless environment of space. The final maneuver by the second stage engine is scheduled to begin around 29 minutes into the mission, followed by separation of the Hotbird 13F spacecraft at T+plus 36 minutes, 11 seconds, according to a mission timeline released by SpaceX.

The launcher’s guidance computer will target a geostationary transfer orbit ranging more than 20,000 miles above Earth.

After flying free of its SpaceX launcher, Hotbird 13F will unfurl solar panels and switch on its plasma propulsion system for several months of orbit-raising maneuver to reach a circular geostationary orbit more than 22,000 miles (nearly 36,000 kilometers) over the equator. The orbit-raising using electric propulsion takes longer than maneuvers relying on conventional rocket engines.

Hotbird 13F will orbit in lock-step with Earth’s rotation at 13 degrees east longitude.

By the middle of next year, Hotbird 13F should be ready to enter commercial service to start a 15-year mission broadcasting television programming to Eutelsat customers. Hotbird 13G, set for launch in November on another Falcon 9 rocket, will follow about a month after its twin satellite, heading for the same position in geostationary orbit.

“Hotbird 13F is the first of two satellites to be placed at the Eutelsat flagship 13 degrees east position, so this is an important event for us,” said Pascal Homsy, Eutelsat’s chief technical officer. “It will be the first satellite based on the electric propulsion Eurostar Neo platform by Airbus, fostering innovation and competitiveness in the European space industry.”

Thanks to improvements in satellite communications technology, Eutelsat will only need two new Hotbird satellites to replace the three aging Hotbird spacecraft operating at 13 degree east.

Homsy said the Hotbird fleet at 13 degrees east form the highest capacity satellite broadcasting system covering the Europe, Middle East, and North Africa regions, delivering 1,000 TV channels to more than 160 million homes. Hotbird 13F and 13G will broadcast signals in Ku-band frequencies.

“We have something like over 600 pay TV channels, 300 free to air channels, 450 high definition TV, and 14 ultra high definition channels broadcast from this flagship 13 degrees east position,” Homsy said. “We are able also to provide 500 radio stations and multimedia services.”

Viau, head of ESA’s telecom directorate, said the space agency encourages its partners to launch their satellites on European rockets. Eutelsat, which owns the Hotbird 13F spacecraft, decided to launch the mission on a SpaceX rocket instead of with an Ariane launcher, based at the European-run spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana.

There are only three Ariane 5 rockets left to fly before retirement of that version of the Ariane launcher. And Europe’s new Ariane 6 rocket is not expected to debut until some time next year.

“There was just no possibility to take a seat on Ariane 5,” Homsy said. “We cannot delay the launch of this Hotbird and its brother in a month simply because they have to replace the three existing satellites which are already operating at 13 degrees east, which are going to come to an end of life by the time the two new satellites will come into service. So we had a very harsh deadline.

“We could not take any risks, and the only option that was finally available at hand was to launch from Florida,” Homsy said. “We would have loved to have launched from Kourou, but it was just not feasible.”

"28 October, 50th Anniversary of the first flight of the Airbus A300 - Airbus","Fri, 28 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTEwLTI4LW9jdG9iZXItNTB0aC1hbm5pdmVyc2FyeS1vZi10aGUtZmlyc3QtZmxpZ2h0LW9mLXRoZS1haXJidXMtYTMwMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"50 years ago today the first Airbus aircraft, the A300B, embarked on its maiden flight. On this historic anniversary we look back with pride and admiration at the aircraft and programme that were at the beginning of the Airbus story.

On 28 October 1972, the world’s first twin engined widebody commercial aircraft, the A300B1 development aircraft, MSN 1, bearing the registration F-WUAB, performed its maiden flight in Toulouse. The test flight crew were Captain Max Fischl, First Officer Bernard Ziegler, Flight Test Engineers Pierre Caneil and Gunter Scherer, with Romeo Zinzoni as Test Flight Engineer/Mechanic in the cockpit. The flight was initially scheduled for Friday 27 October but unfavourable weather conditions (fog) pushed it back by 24 hours. On the following day, Saturday 28th, conditions were better with some sunshine but with the risk of wind. However the weather was judged sufficiently good for the flight to go ahead. The flight lasted 1h 25 min. during which a maximum speed of 185kt (342.6Kmh) was reached at an altitude of 14,000ft (4,300m). Autopilot was engaged, moving surfaces were tested and landing gear retraction and deployment were performed. Upon return to Blagnac airport, strong wind gusts, the famous Toulouse “Vent d’Autan”, required a controlled crosswind landing which was expertly handled by Max Fischl.

Forging a collective European ambition

In the mid 1960s, various studies for a new 250-seat short-to-medium-haul aircraft were being considered by European aircraft manufacturers. The HBN 100 had been in discussion between Hawker Siddeley, Breguet and Nord Aviation, and alternative designs for a similar sized aircraft, the Galion, were also being considered by Sud Aviation. Germany’s MBB and VFW, later to collectively become Deutsche Airbus, had also set up a dedicated “air bus” study group. European airframers at the time, although leaders in many technological developments and having produced some excellent airliners, only had around 10% of the global market share, with the remaining 90% going to the three main American manufacturers. To say the stakes were high is an understatement. Only an aircraft borne of a transnational collaboration would be able to successfully challenge the long-established competition while substantially reducing the development costs for each of the participants.

By 1966, the studies had evolved into a joint European project, the French government appointed Sud-Aviation as its partner in the venture, whilst Deutsche Airbus and Hawker Siddeley would respectively represent Germany and the United Kingdom. Engine development was initially trusted to Rolls-Royce, who were to develop the power plants (RB.207) for the new “air bus”.

In July 1967, a framework agreement for ""strengthening European cooperation in the field of aviation for the joint development and production of an air bus” (a non-proprietary term used by the airline industry in the 1960s to refer to a commercial aircraft of a certain size and range) was reached by the French, German and UK governments, allowing detailed design work and planning to start in earnest. By this time the project had evolved towards a 270 to 300 seat aircraft (hence the A300 name).

In April 1969, the UK government decided to withdraw from the programme due to uncertain commercial prospects and because Rolls-Royce, who was positioned to be the “official” UK partner in the Airbus venture, had decided to focus its efforts on the development of a less powerful engine, the RB211, for the Lockheed Tristar and was not keen on developing another engine, the RB.207, for the Airbus. This resulted in the selection of the General Electric CF6-50A as the engine for the A300, with the additional benefit that it was a proven engine, hence reducing risks for the development and certification of a brand new airframe.



The A300 gets the green light

By the time of its launch, the aircraft's capacity had also been reduced to some 225 passengers, this at the request of the two initial potential customers, Air France and Lufthansa who did not require the larger 300 seater which British European Airways and Rolls-Royce were initially in favour of. As a result, the design was updated with a new fuselage cross-section which was able to accommodate eight seats in a row (instead of nine) with two aisles, and also two standard LD3 containers side by side in the belly holds. This could be achieved by slightly raising the floor of the cabin, making it the optimum fuselage cross-section for what would become a true twin-aisle wide-body. This new version was thus named A300B to reflect the new configuration.

At the 1969 Le Bourget Airshow, France and Germany formally co-launched the A300B programme. The signature ceremony between the French Transport Minister Jean Chamant and German Economics Minister Karl Schiller took place inside a specially constructed forward fuselage mock up.



To provide the necessary legal and governance framework for the programme, Airbus Industrie was formally established as a Groupement d'Intérêt Économique (Economic Interest Group or GIE) on 18 December 1970. Shareholders were the French company SNIAS, later to be called Aérospatiale (the merged Nord and Sud Aviation companies) and the West German company Deutsche Airbus, which was the legal entity representing MBB, VFW and Hamburger Flugzeugbau (HFB), each owning a 50% share. In October 1971, CASA of Spain acquired a 4.2% share of Airbus Industrie, with Aérospatiale and Deutsche Airbus reducing their respective stakes. Despite the British government having stepped away from the venture, Hawker Siddeley remained onboard in a private capacity as an “associate” partner to supply the A300’s wings on the design of which they had already substantially progressed at time of the programme launch. In 1977, Hawker Siddeley and British Aircraft Corporation merged to form British Aerospace and in January 1979, British Aerospace joined the Airbus consortium by acquiring a 20% share, further reducing the shares of the original partners to 37.9% each.



Keys to success

Successful international industrial cooperation, on an until then, unprecedented scale in the aviation industry was key to the A300’s success. Thanks to the knowledge acquired through the national aircraft programmes that predated the A300 (SE210 Caravelle, BAC111, HS121 Trident…) and the experience and lessons learnt through two important transnational cooperation programmes; Transall C-160, (between France and Germany) and Concorde (between France and Great Britain), the Airbus project had strong foundations on which to build the new programme.

Of course, the support of the founding nation governments meant that a political balance was also required when defining the workshare and responsibilities amongst the partners. This included not only the production of the sections for which each of the partners was responsible, but also its design and development as well as all the equipment that was to go into each section. The resulting industrial and organisational model was a rather natural and pragmatic distribution defined by the skills and areas of strength of each partner. This allowed each of the GIE members to bring their best competences and brightest minds to the table. We truly can speak in hindsight of centres of excellence in an age before the expression was widely adopted.

A300B lofting plates etching in the design office

Designing, manufacturing, assembling and marketing a cutting-edge and complex enterprise such as a new generation airliner by four nations with four different languages, cultures, historical differences and distinct ways of working was deemed by many at the time as not being the best recipe for success. In fact, it turned out that these differences were key to the successful completion on time and on quality of the first development aircraft. It went as far as dispensing altogether with building a “prototype” as had been common practice in the industry. Indeed, nothing was left to chance and extra care, attention and continuous refinement were implemented to ensure that risks, errors and misunderstandings were mitigated and that the nascent collaborative culture evolved in the right direction. An innovative policy of multinational critical design analysis meant that collective agreement was necessary at each step of the process, this allowed different technical approaches and solutions to be explored, and fostered cultural cross-fertilisation which is still a key feature of how Airbus works today. Another innovation was for each partner to supply their constituent assemblies for final assembly in Toulouse pre-equipped at section and subassembly level which vastly accelerated the final assembly process. As a result, the amount of work performed on the final assembly line, which also includes final ground controls, represented no more than 4 % of the total amount of work needed to build the aircraft. Internationalisation was also a unique facet of the A300 project with a clear policy of using an international supply chain to procure the very best equipment, systems and materials available at the time.

Production of the first A300B1, MSN 1 commenced in September 1969 and the completed aircraft was rolled out on 28 September 1972, only one month to the day before its first flight! Remarkably the workshare, responsibilities and specialisation of the industrial sites and the logistical “ballet” involved in the construction of the first A300 remains virtually the same for the current Airbus range of aircraft, albeit augmented by the progress and developments in design, production and assembly which have intervened over the course of the last 50 years.

The two subsequent aircraft to be produced continued to be used for flight test and development purposes before being sold to customers. MSN2 was the second – and last - A300B1 to be built. MSN 3 was the first A300B2. This stretched version of the initial A300B1 was developed at the request of Air France. Being 2.6m longer, the A300B2 could accommodate 251 passengers in a standard two class configuration which remained the standard for all subsequent A300B2 & B4 versions (the B4 had the same seating capacity as the initial B2 but with an increased range, allowing it to enter the medium range market) . All three aircraft underwent intensive flight testing and demo flight campaigns achieving type certification on 11 March 1974, less than 18 months after its maiden flight, and slightly ahead of schedule, on cost and with guaranteed performance met.



Variants and derivatives

In 1974 the A300B4, the longer-range variant with increased weight and additional fuel tanks went into serial production. The A300 subsequently proved to be a particularly efficient platform allowing for further development, and numerous variants were designed, tested and built over a programme lifespan of nearly 35 years. These include the A300B10, which was eventually launched under the designation A310 in 1978 and which first flew in April 1982. The A310 was a shorter, reduced capacity, medium-long haul version of the A300, but with a completely new wing. The A300-600, an extended version of the A300B4 with a redesigned rear fuselage section carried over from the A310 allowing for two additional seat rows and additional containers underfloor and incorporating many of the improvements introduced on the A310, would first fly in 1983. The A300-600F, a freighter version of the passenger aircraft, would enter into service in 1993. The A300B9 and A300B11 projects would eventually provide the basis for the A330 and A340 family of aircraft, with the same ground breaking fuselage cross-section that was introduced on the initial A300. Finally, last but not least, five A300-600ST “Belugas” would be built to meet Airbus’ internal requirements for increased oversized transport capacity and to replace the ageing Aero Spacelines Super Guppy fleet. Altogether 821 aircraft of the A300 family were produced in all configurations and types.



Innovative design features of the A300

Whilst the defining feature of the A300 was the fact that it was the first twin-engined widebody, constant design evolution across the family, along with the integration of new technology and materials, earned it a place in aviation history with many industry “firsts'': the first application of composites on secondary, and subsequently on primary structures, the first application of a two-man forward-facing cockpit for a twin-aisle with the A300 FFCC, the first use of electrical signalling for secondary controls and the introduction of both drag-reducing centre of gravity control and wingtip devices (introduced on the A300-600), and the first widebody designed for a two-man flight crew on the A310. With all of the A300’s innovations, Airbus was truly living up to its “setting the standards'' motto of the time.



The A300 today

At present, more than 250 A300/A310 aircraft are in operation with 37 operators. 75% of the fleet are freighters and it is the third most-operated freighter type worldwide. More than 60% are operated by four major customers which project operating their fleets until at least 2030. The A300/A310 Programme team ensures customer satisfaction is maintained throughout the current projected life cycle of the A300/A310 Family by supporting operations but also by proposing upgrades and improvements to further increase mission capabilities. 50 years later Airbus has evolved into a global company with manufacturing, assembly and sales and services activities spread across five continents. One of the lesser publicised ambitions, at the time, of the founders of Airbus was for the A300 to be the first in a family of commercial aircraft; In 1968 an early advertisement for the A300 stated it was “the start of something big”. Little did they know how prophetic those words would turn out to be!","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9994908571243286}",neutral,0.9994908571243286,0

SAF is a sustainably-produced aviation fuel made from feedstocks ranging from used fat, oil and grease to municipal and forestry waste. Compared to fossil jet fuel, SAF has been demonstrated to result in an up to 80% reduction in CO 2 emissions across the entire SAF lifecycle. Therefore, it is considered as a key enabler to contribute to the decarbonization of aviation.

The SAF for the delivery flights in China is produced locally from used cooking oil by SINOPEC Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Company, a state-owned manufacturer in China. It is the first batch of Chinese SAF made by the only certified Chinese facility.

“The first SAF delivery flight of Airbus aircraft in Tianjin marks a historic milestone for Airbus and particularly for us in China,” said George XU, Airbus EVP & Airbus China CEO. “It is a great step towards our vision of contributing to sustainable aviation as a long-term reliable partner in China. Thanks to the joint effort and the consensus on sustainability between us and our partners, we will be able to offer such sustainable solutions to all customers taking delivery from our Tianjin facilities. Going forward, we also aim to partner with more Airbus operators in China to fly commercially with SAF to further support the green aviation strategy in China.”

Currently, all Airbus commercial aircraft are capable of flying with an up to 50 percent SAF blend mixed with kerosene and are targeted to be capable for 100 percent SAF use in flight by the end of this decade. Since March 2021, Airbus has successfully accomplished 100 percent SAF test flights on A319neo, A350 and A380 aircraft.

With 90% of goods around the world being transported by sea and 98% of digital data transiting through submarine cables, plus the vast array of marine life, energy and mining resources, maritime spaces are more than ever becoming strategic assets.

At Euronaval, starting 18 October 2022, Airbus will show the many range of ways our teams are pioneering to help protect these critical areas.

Gathering intelligence to safeguard oceans

70.8% of Earth is covered by water equating to a massive 361 million km2 of seas and oceans to be monitored. Gathering intelligence over maritime areas is a challenge of colossal proportions and Airbus has taken it on with the development of several dedicated systems - which includes an array of unmanned aerial systems ranging from light to long-endurance aircraft.

Aliaca is an onboard mini-UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) system chosen by the French Navy for the SMDM (Systèmes de Mini Drones aériens embarqués de la Marine) contract, which was signed in the last quarter of 2020. It covers the supply of 11 Aliaca systems (including 22 air vehicles) in a maritime version for the French Navy, as well as associated training and maintenance for the given operational conditions. Aliaca was certified and qualified by the French Armament General Directorate (DGA) in July 2022.

VSR700, the unmanned aerial system that is currently under development and has been designed to operate alongside other shipborne naval assets, will provide commanders with an improved tactical picture, greater search and rescue power, and bring to bear a highly capable autonomous platform in times of heightened threats. Its compact size and discreet silhouette enhance stealth, and its payload accommodates a host of long-range, high-performance sensors – the optimal capability enhancement for modern navies.

The third system is Eurodrone: a Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) with versatile and adaptable capabilities that make it the perfect platform for Intelligence, Surveillance Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) missions or homeland security operations. Its open architecture as part of the future-proof design will allow for growth and rescoping system capabilities as may be required by the future needs of customer armed forces.

Space also plays a key role in maritime surveillance missions. For more than 30 years, Airbus has delivered actionable interoperable intelligence that enables responses at greater speed and with greater certainty. With proprietary access to the world’s leading satellite constellations – including Pléiades Neo, which has an optical resolution of 30 cm – Airbus supplies sustainable satellite imagery and data solutions.

Leading the digital transformation

Gathering information is not enough. Extracting meaning and analysis from data and intelligence are where Airbus technologies make a difference.

With extensive experience in Command, Control, Computers, Communications, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance, Airbus launched its Multi-Domain Combat Cloud (MDCC) project, which uses cloud-based technologies to create a cyber-resilient collaborative network across air, land, sea space and cyber domains.

With this technology, each asset constitutes a connecting node regardless if it is a warship, a fighter jet, a headquarters or a tank and provides critical information to militaries.

Since 2002, Airbus has been developing, deploying and upgrading the SPATIONAV system to support the French authorities’ gathering of information, direct maritime surveillance and intervention at sea. The system provides them with a tactical picture of the maritime situation to prepare and conduct their operations related to maritime border protection, search and rescue missions, maritime navigation security, detection of illicit activities and environmental protection.

SPATIONAV covers 6,000 kilometres of French coastline monitored in real-time 24/7 by 750 operators thanks to a vast network of sensors (105 sites, 88 radars, 77 AIS stations and 8 equipped Falcons). In addition, the system integrates over 50,000 extra European and international tracks.

Safeguarding information and securing digital networks is also key to maritime operations. In response to cyber-attacks that have become a daily threat and are increasingly sophisticated, Airbus Defence and Space has developed a defensive cyber warfare system to secure military networks and protect data. It includes monitoring, warning, detection and response capabilities that identify the origin, target, criticality and impact of such attacks, enabling them to be countered with a suitable response plan.

A key to defending against cyber-attacks is being ready for these threats through preparation and training. Airbus’ CyberRange advanced simulation solution easily models information technology (IT) systems and operational technology (OT) systems to simulate realistic scenarios including actual cyber-attacks. It is used by many Defence customers including the French navy.

Operating in a rough environment

Operating at sea is a constant challenge. Having designed and built aircraft specifically for maritime operations for decades, Airbus has gathered a unique know-how that benefits our latest generation of naval aircraft.

The first of a new generation of helicopter, the H160M derives from the EASA-certified H160. It benefits from a low cost of operations and enhanced flight safety features. The H160M incorporates the latest technological achievements in European aeronautics.

To ensure a high level of availability while reducing operating costs, the H160M’s support and services needs were taken into account from early in its design phase.

As a naval asset, the H160M is a formidable addition to anti-surface warfare, naval force protection, maritime security, maritime environment monitoring and intelligence, and search and rescue. The civil version of the H160 can also be used by military and public operators for search and rescue (SAR) and surveillance missions. The French Navy has recently received its first out of six H160s configured for SAR operations.

The NH90 military helicopter is a modern, multi-role rotorcraft designed to meet the most stringent NATO standards. Developed in two versions – tactical transport (TTH) and NATO frigate helicopter (NFH) – the NH90 contains a unique, fully integrated mission system for operations in the most demanding conditions over land and sea, day and night. Over 170 NH90 NFHs have been ordered by seven different customers with more than 123 aircraft being delivered so far.

Advanced navigation and ship landing aids enable the helicopter to perform safe landings in day, night or adverse weather conditions, supplemented by a deck lock device for securing the touchdown in high sea states.

The NFH has fulfilled missions along the east coast of Africa, in the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean, the Caribbean, Mediterranean and northern waters. Its operational versatility and wide range of capabilities make it the most effective naval helicopter available today. It is a true force multiplier and an essential asset for any operation.

In the domain of maritime patrol aircraft, Airbus is considering developing an aircraft based on the highly successful A320Neo that would be designed for long range maritime patrol (MPA) including the most demanding anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and anti-surface (ASuW) missions.

Revenues € 38.1 billion; EBIT Adjusted € 3.5 billion

EBIT (reported) € 3.6 billion; EPS (reported) € 3.26

Free cash flow before M&A and customer financing € 2.9 billion

2022 guidance updated for FCF before M&A and customer financing



Amsterdam, 28 October 2022 – Airbus SE (stock exchange symbol: AIR) reported consolidated financial results for the nine months ended 30 September 2022.

“Airbus delivered a solid nine-month 2022 financial performance in a complex operating environment,” said Guillaume Faury, Airbus Chief Executive Officer. “The supply chain remains fragile resulting from the cumulative impact of COVID, the war in Ukraine, energy supply issues and constrained labour markets. Our strong focus on cash flow and the favourable dollar/euro environment have enabled us to raise our free cash flow guidance for 2022. The commercial aircraft delivery and earnings targets are maintained. Our teams are focused on our key priorities and in particular, delivering the commercial aircraft ramp-up over the coming months and years.”

Gross commercial aircraft orders increased to 856 (9m 2021: 270 aircraft) with net orders of 647 aircraft after cancellations (9m 2021: 133 aircraft). The order backlog amounted to 7,294 commercial aircraft at the end of September 2022. Airbus Helicopters registered 246 net orders (9m 2021: 185 units), with bookings well spread across programmes. Airbus Defence and Space’s order intake by value was € 8.0 billion (9m 2021: € 10.1 billion), corresponding to a book-to-bill ratio slightly above 1. Third quarter 2022 order intake mainly related to services across the Division's portfolio.

Consolidated revenues increased to € 38.1 billion (9m 2021: € 35.2 billion). A total of 437(1) commercial aircraft were delivered (9m 2021: 424(2) aircraft), comprising 34 A220s, 340 A320 Family, 21 A330sand 42 A350s(2). Revenues generated by Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities increased 8 percent year-on-year, mainly reflecting the higher number of deliveries including a favourable mix and the strengthening of the US dollar. Airbus Helicopters delivered 193 units (9m 2021: 194 units), with revenues rising by 9 percent mainly reflecting growth in services and a favourable mix in programmes. Revenues at Airbus Defence and Space increased 10 percent, mainly driven by the Military Aircraft business and the Eurodrone contract signature. Seven A400M airlifters were delivered in 9m 2022.

Consolidated EBIT Adjusted – an alternativeperformance measure and key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses – increased slightly to € 3,481 million (9m 2021: € 3,369 million).

EBIT Adjusted related to Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities increased to € 2,875 million (9m 2021: € 2,739 million). It included the non-recurring positive impact from retirement obligations recorded in Q1, partly offset by the impact from international sanctions against Russia. It also reflects a less favourable hedge rate compared to 9m 2021.

On the A320 Family programme, production is progressing towards a monthly rate of 65 aircraft in early 2024 and 75 in 2025. The groundwork continues throughout all sites to secure rate 75 and adapt to the higher proportion of A321s in the backlog, ensuring all A320 Family Final Assembly Lines become A321 capable. Preparation for the upgrade of the second A320 FAL in Toulouse is underway. All three test A321XLRs have now flown, with the aircraft’s entry-into-service expected to take place in Q2 2024. On widebody aircraft, the Company is exploring, together with its supply chain, the feasibility of further rate increases to meet growing market demand as international air travel recovers.

Airbus Helicopters’ EBIT Adjusted increased to € 380 million (9m 2021: € 314 million), partly driven by the growth in services and a favourable mix in programmes. It also reflects non-recurring elements booked in Q1, including the positive impact related to retirement obligations.

EBIT Adjusted at Airbus Defence and Space totalled € 231 million (9m 2021: € 284 million). This decrease mainly reflects the impairment related to the Ariane 6 launcher delay, the impact of rising inflation in some long-term contracts across the Division’s portfolio and the consequences of international sanctions, partly offset by the positive impact related to retirement obligations booked in Q1 and Eurodrone.

On the A400M programme, development activities continue towards achieving the revised capability roadmap. Retrofit activities are progressing in close alignment with the customer. Risks remain on the qualification of technical capabilities and associated costs, on aircraft operational reliability, on cost reductions and on securing export orders in time as per the revised baseline.

Consolidated self-financed R&Dexpenses totalled € 1,965 million (9m 2021: € 1,919 million).



Consolidated EBIT(reported) amounted to € 3,552 million (9m 2021: € 3,437 million), including net Adjustments of € +71 million.

These Adjustments comprised:

€ +349 million related to the dollar pre-delivery payment mismatch and balance sheet revaluation, of which € +123 million were in Q3;

€ +33 million related to the A380 programme, of which € +40 million were in Q3;

€ -219 million related to the A400M programme, of which € -1 million were in Q3;

€ -48 million related to the Aerostructures transformation in France and Germany, of which € -15 million were in Q3;

€ -44 million of other costs including compliance, of which € -10 million were in Q3.

The financial result was € -306 million (9m 2021: € -172 million). It mainly reflects the net interest result of € -166 million as well as a negative impact from the revaluation of financial instruments, partly offset by the evolution of the US dollar and the revaluation of certain equity investments. Consolidated net income(3) was € 2,568 million (9m 2021: € 2,635 million) with consolidated reported earnings per share of € 3.26 (9m 2021: € 3.36).

Consolidated free cash flowbefore M&A and customer financing was € 2,899 million (9m 2021: € 2,260 million), reflecting the profit translated into cash and supported by a favourable foreign exchange environment. Consolidated free cash flow was € 2,502 million (9m 2021: € 2,308 million). The 2021 dividend of € 1.50 per share, or € 1.2 billion, was paid in Q2 2022 while pension contributions totalled € 0.5 billion in 9m 2022. On 30 September 2022, the gross cash position stood at € 22.5 billion (year-end 2021: € 22.7 billion) with a consolidated net cash position(4) of € 8.0 billion (year-end 2021: € 7.7 billion).

Outlook

As the basis for its 2022 guidance, the Company assumes no further disruptions to the world economy, air traffic, the Company’s internal operations, and its ability to deliver products and services.

The Company’s 2022 guidance is before M&A.

On that basis,

The Company maintains its targets to achieve around 700 commercial aircraft deliveries and around € 5.5 billion of EBIT Adjusted in 2022.

The Company now targets around € 4.5 billion of Free Cash Flow before M&A and Customer Financing in 2022.

Glossary

KPI DEFINITION EBIT The Company continues to use the term EBIT (Earnings before interest and taxes). It is identical to Profit before finance cost and income taxes as defined by IFRS Rules. Adjustment Adjustment, an alternative performance measure, is a term used by the Company which includes material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses. EBIT Adjusted The Company uses an alternative performance measure, EBIT Adjusted, as a key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses. EPS Adjusted EPS Adjusted is an alternative performance measure of basic earnings per share as reported whereby the net income as the numerator does include Adjustments. For reconciliation, see the Analyst presentation. Gross cash position The Company defines its consolidated gross cash position as the sum of (i) cash and cash equivalents and (ii) securities (all as recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position). Net cash position The Company defines its consolidated net cash position as the sum of (i) cash and cash equivalents and (ii) securities, minus (iii) financing liabilities, plus or minus (iiii) interest rate contracts related to fair value hedges (all as recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position). FCF For the definition of the alternative performance measure free cash flow, see the Universal Registration Document, MD&A section 2.1.6.1. It is a key indicator which allows the Company to measure the amount of cash flow generated from operations after cash used in investing activities. FCF before M&A Free cash flow before mergers and acquisitions refers to free cash flow as defined in the Universal Registration Document, MD&A section 2.1.6.1 adjusted for net proceeds from disposals and acquisitions. It is an alternative performance measure and key indicator that reflects free cash flow excluding those cash flows resulting from acquisitions and disposals of businesses. FCF before M&A and customer financing Free cash flow before M&A and customer financing refers to free cash flow before mergers and acquisitions adjusted for cash flow related to aircraft financing activities. It is an alternative performance measure and indicator that may be used occasionally by the Company in its financial guidance, especially when there is higher uncertainty around customer financing activities.

Footnotes:

Before a reduction of two aircraft previously recorded as sold in December 2021 for which a transfer was not possible due to international sanctions against Russia. Two A350s delivered on operating lease in 9m 2022 and one A330 delivered on operating lease in 9m 2021 without revenue recognition at delivery. Airbus SE continues to use the term Net Income/Loss. It is identical to Profit/Loss for the period attributable to equity owners of the parent as defined by IFRS Rules. The Company has decided to refine the net cash definition to include interest rate contracts related to fair value hedges, which is also reflected in the 9m 2022 balance.

Airbus to join Amazon Air fleet with ten A330-300P2F converted freighters - Airbus,"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0xMC1haXJidXMtdG8tam9pbi1hbWF6b24tYWlyLWZsZWV0LXdpdGgtdGVuLWEzMzAtMzAwcDJmLWNvbnZlcnRlZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HERNDON, Virginia, 21 October 2022 – Amazon Air has signed a firm agreement to lease ten A330-300P2F freighters from Altavair, taking advantage of the A330’s capacity and economics to help fulfil its one-day delivery promise to Amazon Prime customers. The aircraft will be operated for Amazon by Hawaiian Airlines, which has had A330s as a key element of its fleet since 2010. The ten airframes are being converted from passenger aircraft to freighters by Elbe Flugzeugwerke GmbH (EFW), the centre of excellence for Airbus Passenger-to-Freighter (P2F) conversions.

“We’re thrilled to welcome Airbus to our Amazon Air fleet,” said Philippe Karam, Director, Amazon Global Air Fleet & Sourcing. “These A330-300s will not only be the first of their kind in our fleet, they’ll also be the newest, largest aircraft for Amazon Air, allowing us to deliver more customer packages with each flight.”

Amazon Air transports customer packages over longer distances in shorter timeframes to deliver on its customer promise of fast, free delivery. The first of their A330-300P2F aircraft is expected to join the Amazon Air fleet in late 2023.

""The endorsement of our freighters by Amazon speaks volumes about the market value of the A330 and the position Airbus wide-bodies are gaining in the cargo market,” said Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer and Head of Airbus International. “Amazon has built a reputation around delivering their goods to our doorsteps with extraordinary speed and consistency, and we’re very proud that our aircraft are trusted to become a key link in that remarkable logistics chain.”

With advanced Airbus technology that includes fly-by-wire flight controls, the A330 offers an extremely capable platform for freighter conversion. Since the A330’s service entry in 1994, more than 1,700 A330s have been ordered, with more than 1,500 delivered – providing a large source of aircraft to support P2F conversions for many years.

While both A330-200 and A330-300 aircraft are eligible for conversion, the longer-fuselage A330-300P2F is particularly suited for integrators and express carriers, due to its high volumetric payload capability with lower-density cargo.

The A330P2F conversion program, launched in 2012, is a collaboration between ST Aerospace, Airbus and their joint venture EFW.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9825457334518433}",neutral,0.9825457334518433,0
Airbus' multi-mission “cargo copter” is put to the test during a robotic military exercise - Airbus,"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTEwLWFpcmJ1cy1tdWx0aS1taXNzaW9uLWNhcmdvLWNvcHRlci1pcy1wdXQtdG8tdGhlLXRlc3QtZHVyaW5nLWEtcm9ib3RpY9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A sub-scale demonstrator of a future Airbus multi-mission unmanned aerial vehicle demonstrated its capabilities during a large robotic exercise organised last month by the Portuguese Navy and NATO, which brought together military forces, universities and selected industry partners.

By taking part in this exercise, the “cargo copter” operated in a dense robotic environment, validating the concept’s usefulness – particularly its modular design for easy, flexible and rapid swap-out of payloads and batteries.

“This was a great opportunity to trial our small-scale

demonstrator in realistic conditions”

Jens Federhen, X-Works, Airbus Innovation

The demonstrator was developed by Airbus’ UAS New Programmes group in collaboration with the company’s X-Works rapid prototyping team. A system-of-systems approach was applied with the goal of meeting military mission requirements that range from cargo transportation and ISR duties (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) to serving as a communications relay and a combat force multiplier.

Its validation occurred in highly realistic operational conditions during the REP(MUS)2022 military exercise, which was conducted in Portugal’s Troia Peninsula region from 12-23 September. Overall, REP(MUS)2022 brought together some 1,500 personnel to test the coordination of unmanned systems and experimental mission scenarios above the water, on the water and under the sea.

A challenging environment during REP(MUS)2022

“This was a great opportunity to trial our small-scale demonstrator in realistic conditions,” explains Jens Federhen, who leads the X-Works rapid prototyping team. “Performing the demonstrations in such a demanding environment – surrounded by six research ships, 11 warships and 120 uncrewed systems around us – was extremely challenging, and at the same time very productive, as we have been able to learn and create useful collaboration links.”

The sub-scale demonstrator of the future Airbus Multi-Mission and Transport UAS is a 35-kg vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) multicopter. Sized to accommodate a range of payloads, the “cargo copter” is equipped with the Airbus-developed DeckFinder™ all-purpose landing aid for automatic landings on ship decks.

Valuable guidance for the next step

According to Johannes Pittermann, UAS PORTFOLIO MANAGER and REP(MUS)2022 PROJECT MANAGER, Airbus’ participation also helped to answer some open questions for the multi-mission cargo drone’s full-scale concept, providing valuable guidance in follow-on design and development work.

For the full-scale version, Airbus UAS New Programmes envisions a drone capable of carrying payloads of more than 250 kg payload over a range of 300-plus km. Beyond the military applications, Airbus foresees a role for the Airbus Multi-Mission and Transport UAS in civilian use for, e.g. humanitarian and/ or disaster/crisis management.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9966400861740112}",neutral,0.9966400861740112,0

"The best gets even better – A350 introduces new performance and Airspace cabin enhancements, benefitting ... - Airbus Aircraft","Wed, 26 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vYWlyY3JhZnQuYWlyYnVzLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzcm9vbS9zdG9yaWVzLzIwMjItMTAtdGhlLWJlc3QtZ2V0cy1ldmVuLWJldHRlci1hMzUwLWludHJvZHVjZXMtbmV3LXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLWFuZC1haXJzcGFjZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Reinforcing the A350 Family’s position as the most sustainable large widebody today, with lower structural weight, enhanced performance, maximum versatility and more cabin space, choice and flexibility for all business models.

Airbus is introducing new A350 performance gains combined with various cabin enhancements for airlines and their passengers. This comes with a new product evolution standard now being delivered to airline customers. The performance improvements include weight savings, improved take-off performance, and increased Maximum Take-off Weight (MTOW) capability. The Airspace cabin improvements provide more space, choice and flexibility, covering a wider cross-section in the revenue passenger areas, more space at both the front and rear of the aircraft for new larger galleys, a new flight-crew rest compartment in the upper crown area, and a new large forward lavatory. The new standard also includes the option for the latest third-generation of electro-dimmable windows.

1. A350 PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS

Structural weight reduction – for lower CO2 emissions and greater productivity

When compared with the A350s in service today, the new standard brings a significant overall weight reduction. Both the A350-900 and larger A350-1000 benefit from these improvements – which account for up to 1.2 metric tonnes of weight reduction. Airbus achieved this by optimising systems, structures and installations on various areas of the aircraft. These included the electrical system installation with further optimisation in the crown with new cable concepts; cabin systems optimisation – such as a new single water tank, a new waste tank and lighter floor panel heating. In the mechanical system installation Airbus has introduced new composite ducts for a more optimised air distribution. There are also new nacelle and pylon structural weight-saving optimisations.

The A350 Programme has also taken the opportunity to increase the use of advanced materials such as carbon fibre to further reduce weight. For example in the wing structure we further optimised upper and lower wing covers, the landing gear support structure, and in the fuselage structure there is additional use of CFRP in the door surrounds.

Improved hot & high take-off performance for greater operational flexibility

These latest A350s will also benefit from an enhanced take-off performance especially when operating out of challenging airports (high altitude, short runways, hot weather etc.). To this end Airbus has introduced software evolutions which regulate the slat and flap positions, and has also implemented a faster landing gear retraction cycle – conferring greater obstacle clearance and reduced aerodynamic drag.

With these changes, the A350-900 could, on average, benefit from 3.5 additional tonnes of available take-off weight (e.g. for extra fuel and/or payload uplift) from a limiting runway, while the larger A350-1000 benefits from an approximate 2.5 tonne improvement. At some airports the potential take-off weight uplift gains could be improved by more than six tonnes (ie. at La Reunion and Mumbai), or by more than four extra tonnes (at Phoenix or Dublin). Overall, take-off weight improvements for the newest A350s would occur at around 50 airports currently operated by widebody aircraft. Airbus has also increased MTOW capabilities (now up to 283t for the A350-900 and 319t for the A350-1000) allowing them to maintain their respective maximum range capabilities, beyond 8,000nm, while carrying greater revenue payload than before.

2. A350 AIRSPACE CABIN INNOVATIONS

Wider Airspace cabin for further class-differentiation possibilities, flexibility and increased space

One of the most significant A350 cabin improvements is the additional cabin volume thanks to four inches of cabin width, bringing it to 225 inches. This extra room comes from re-sculpting the sidewalls which releases two-inches on each side along the cylindrical constant section.

Since the extra cabin width benefits all classes of passenger seating, the extra space can go towards widening the aisles, the armrests, seat-pan in between the armrests, the centre console in Premium Economy – or a combination of these. Moreover, while the A350 today already offers a 10-abreast option for airlines that need a high-density layout, the extra width in the latest A350 standard transforms the passenger comfort of previous 3-4-3 arrangement by now accommodating the full 17-inch wide industry standard economy seats – already used by many mainline carriers for their passengers.

Notably, compared with a nine-abreast Economy Class, the new 10-abreast offering could enable airlines to accommodate approximately 30 additional seats, in a typical three-class layout on their new A350-900s and the A350-1000s.

The wider cabin also allows for further class-differentiation and revenue-generation possibilities. For example, the original economy seats in a 3-3-3 arrangement – formerly 18-inch seats – now can become even wider – 18.7 inches – verging into ‘economy-plus’.

The wider A350 cabin brings even more Airspace comfort in 9- or 10-abreast economy (10-abreast shown)

Meanwhile the premium economy cabin can grow to offer 19 inch seats with a five inch centre console and an 18 inch aisle.

Designed-in flexibility for growth to 10-abreast seating

Flexibility is designed-in to the new cabin, so that airlines who initially select a nine-abreast 3-3-3 economy section could easily upgrade it in the future to the new 10-abreast layout. This flexibility is made possible the same seat rails, tracks and IFE interfaces will fit either nine or 10 abreast seating – without needing to change the floor attachment interfaces when changing the seats from one to the other.

Flexibility also applies to the supporting floor panels of the original A350 design – which were already sized for future higher seat densities, such as with the new 10-abreast option. Likewise, the aircraft’s plentiful air-conditioning flow capacity is matched for extra passengers, so no change was needed here either.

Retaining all the benefits of the original A350 Airspace cabin

In parallel, uprated insulation in the new sidewalls ensure that the acoustic and thermal insulation properties remain at the same industry-leading levels as before – and therefore the A350 remains the quietest aircraft in its category. The A350 is also renowned for having near-vertical sidewalls – thanks in part to its carbon-fibre fuselage construction which permits a non-circular fuselage cross-section. Passengers will therefore be pleased that the enlarged cabin cross-section retains this vertical sidewall feature, in particular so that the extra width is available at hip, shoulder and also at head level. Another benefit of the CFRP fuselage construction is the lower (6,000ft) cabin altitude pressure combined with improved humidity levels during cruise – leading to less overall passenger fatigue.

Longer cabin – larger galley & lavatory areas for improved cabin crew workspace and enhanced in-flight passenger service

In addition to the four-inch cabin width increase, Airbus engineers have also reclaimed 35 more inches of cabin length. This has been achieved by slightly shifting forwards the cockpit wall and optimising monument arrangements, while at the back of the aircraft, behind the last set of doors, the rear pressure bulkhead (RPB) has been repositioned by one frame rearwards – thus making extra space for an even larger rear galley area.

The resulting new redesigned monuments provide additional flexibility and catering capacity for operators, as well as improved working areas for flight crews. For example, the increased monument floor space available in the front-left area (forward Door1L) allows for up to four trolleys (previously three). Alternatively, a 50-inch wide PRM-capable, premium lavatory can now be installed there, sufficiently wide and also with a ramp for direct wheelchair access. It also includes an additional call button, handles plus other PRM-friendly features.

Full-size PRM lavatory option in forward cabin

Meanwhile, just opposite, on the right-hand-side (just forward of Door1R) the large galley offers useful worktop space, more space for galley-inserts (GAINS). This was achieved not only by moving the cockpit wall, but also by relocating the staircase to the Flight Crew Rest Compartment (FCRC) – previously in the front-right galley area – to the other side of the adjacent centre galley, aft of Doors1. Overall, the changes to the forward area galleys allow for up to three more trolleys than before, including the optional crew-rest.

New larger galley in forward area

When it comes to the rear galley area, the A350 cabin now brings the possibility of eXtra Large (“XL”) galleys that allow for up to six additional trolleys with an increase in floor surface area as well as effective working area for crews. Once again, flexibility is part of the A350, which is enhanced thanks to the extra space resulting from moving the RPB further back. The result is that it is now possible to offer airlines a new “V-shape XL Galley”, or an “ICE XL Galley” (ICE = Increased Cabin Efficiency). The latter can incorporate two lavatories – one either side (as did the previous ICE Galley), thus freeing-up extra space in the revenue passenger cabin in front of Doors4.

New ICE XL Galley – more work-space and room for six additional trolleys

Electro-dimmable windows – blocks 99.999% of light, reduces weight and is easy to maintain

Now that electro-dimmable window (EDW) technology has matured, Airbus is pleased to offer this solution to its customers of the newest version of the A350 Family now being delivered. Compared with previous designs, the latest generation of EDWs, developed by Gentex, darken twice as fast and become 100 times darker than the original version. In addition, they can now effectively block more than 99.999% of visible light as well as the infra-red energy from the sun (which also helps to keep the cabin interior cooler and thus reduce the load on the air-conditioning system). STARLUX Airlines, headquartered in Taipei, is the first operator to select these devices for its newly-delivered A350 aircraft.

Gentex supplies the latest 3rd-generation EDWs for the A350

The new EDWs also provide more comfort to passengers by allowing individual dimming of their windows while still looking outside if they wish. The windows also bring advantages for maintenance crews since they can be easily and quickly unclipped from the window bezels using a special tool (and without having to remove any seat or sidewall panels) and immediately swapped-out with a serviced replacement insert – which also makes for a fast turnaround.

3. SUMMARY

The new standard of A350s include a wide spectrum of value-adding product evolutions. Moreover this approach is the latest example of Airbus’ policy of continuously driving innovation to improve its aircraft products, based on its customer needs. The A350 Family, which was already the world’s most advanced and efficient new widebody, provides airline customers with increased performance, efficiency and revenue-generating possibilities. Furthermore, the A350’s Airspace cabin now offers even more space and choice for airlines to create a superior in-flight service and experience for their passengers.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999998807907104}",positive,0.9999998807907104,1

Airbus surprises with pact to add SES on supplier-furnished IFC - Runway Girl Network,"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvYWlyYnVzLXNlcy1zdXBwbGllci1mdXJuaXNoZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONG BEACH — In a surprise move, Airbus has inked a letter of agreement with SES, paving the way for the satellite operator to become the second managed service provider (MSP) in its supplier-furnished Airspace Link HBCplus catalogue. Following a contract signature with Airbus, SES is expected to bring its “combined MEO and GEO” Ka-band network through the Airbus ecosystem for the first time, said the European airframer.

The news, which was revealed at the Airline Passenger Experience Association (APEX)/IFSA Exhibition in Long Beach, California, comes just four months after Airbus unveiled its linefit HBCplus program at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg, where it announced Safran Passenger Innovations (SPI) as the terminal provider and hardware integrator, using ThinKom’s popular VICTS antennae, plus Inmarsat as the first managed service provider supplying its Ka-band satellite-powered Global Xpress service.

Under HBCplus, Airbus not only factory-fits the supplier-furnished inflight connectivity hardware to A320, A330 and A350 twinjets, but has overall responsibility to airline customers, providing support and warranties. Effectively, the program allows airlines to switch bandwidth suppliers without changing the hardware “so the aircraft doesn’t have to go through a rip-and-replace procedure that we now see happening actually in the United States”, Airbus upgrades marketing director Yannic Duifhuizen told Runway Girl Network last week at the APEX/IFSA show in apparent reference to Delta Air Lines’ massive rip-and-replace program.

As such, the SPI terminal will also serve as the conduit for SES’s Ka-band services as part of HBCplus.

The terminal includes “the latest and greatest ThinKom antenna. So, we have higher reliability — about three times more. There is parts interchangeability, so in case you operate a widebody and narrowbody single-aisle fleet, you can make use of the parts across the fleet,” noted Duifhuizen, adding that airlines can also select their desired level of performance. “[T]his really depends on how much the airline is willing to pay but you can go up all the way to 800 Mbps if your pockets are really deep; the technology and the hardware is capable of it and we’ve really embedded it as an SFE [supplier-furnished equipment] option in our catalog so that airlines can select it while configuring their aircraft.”

Highlighting the fact that the SPI terminal can support Inmarsat GX or SES Ka-band services, Duifhuizen said: “It’s one antenna to rule them all, as I like to say. That’s it guys, really, for the Ka frequency.”

Duifhuizen explained that the HBCplus model is “a triangle setup” involving the airframer, the airline and the MSP.

So we have a customer, Yannic Airlines [for example], then we have Airbus taking care of the aircraft hardware, the antenna, diagnostics… and then we have the MSP completing the triangle and the contract for the bandwidth will be between the airline and the MSP.

Will traditional aero ISPs (such as SITA, Thales and others) still have a role to play, RGN asked? “[T]hey will definitely exist between the airline and the MSP”, he said, if the airline wants that sort of arrangement.

If our customer wants someone in the middle to manage it — manage the portal or go different from what Inmarsat [or SES] is offering as a standard package — definitely from an Airbus point of view we allow that to happen. So that’s really between the airline and the MSP to define together.

For many IFC stakeholders, SES’s win of MSP status on Airbus’ new linefit SFE inflight connectivity program seems like a very ‘zero to sixty’ moment. While SES provides broadbeam and high throughput Ku-band satellite service to multiple inflight Internet service providers today — and its SES-17 Ka-band satellite is powering Spirit Airlines’ IFC via integrator and aero ISP Thales (with a retrofitted ThinKom Ka-band VICTS antenna) — SES itself is “not even an aero ISP”, noted one alarmed executive on the APEX/IFSA show floor.

So, Runway Girl Network put the question to Duifhuizen: what is SES bringing to the table that struck you guys as making sense?

“I think their innovative approach of looking at GEO and MEO satellites is really something that adds a lot of value in their offerings,” he replied, adding that SES’s forthcoming O3b mPOWER MEO network will ensure global coverage as part of this multi-orbit solution. The first mPOWER satellite is expected to launch in the fourth quarter.

In fairness to SES, the satellite operator has been talking about mPOWER for aero for several years, telling RGN back in 2017 that mPOWER would be capable of addressing, among other things, ”every aircraft flying in the world”. Two years earlier, SES told RGN that it didn’t want to be “the invisible guy” in aero.

In becoming a key player in Airbus’ new supplier-furnished HBCplus program, SES is certainly ensuring it’s not invisible. “SES along with its global partners are building a truly differentiated multi-orbit network, which is capable of providing the best IFC service in the air for both short-haul and long-haul commercial aviation markets. We look forward to concluding our partnership with Airbus and working together to bring these innovative multi-orbit global capabilities to the Airspace Link HBCplus ecosystem,” said SES chief strategy and product officer JP Hemingway in a statement.

Meanwhile, Airbus has indicated it is open to adding additional managed service providers to the HBCplus program, including those that support Ku-band connectivity. “[W]e’re in talks with everyone”, said Duifhuizen when pressed by RGN if the likes of OneWeb and SpaceX’s Starlink might be included. “We’re not excluding anyone at this stage and [are] absolutely in discussions.”

ThinKom does offer a VICTS antenna in the Ku-band. Intelsat (formerly Gogo) famously adopted the solution for its 2Ku-branded inflight connectivity kit, which is rolling off the line on Airbus A220s and A320s as part of Airbus’ buyer-furnished equipment catalog. And Panasonic Avionics selected a nextgen version of the hardware for future installs (having recently agreed to offer OneWeb-powered connectivity, Panasonic might also conceivably end up using the Sidewinder terminal for certain packages).

It’s unclear, however, if a terminal with the Ku-band version of VICTS will be selected when Airbus onboards Ku-band managed service providers for HBCplus. That’s the type of technology decision that is under review “and we’re looking at it as we speak”, Duifhuizen told RGN at the APEX/IFSA EXPO.

Frontier unveils new Airbus A321neo with fuel-efficient Pratt & Whitney engines at TPA - Tampa International Airport,"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy50YW1wYWFpcnBvcnQuY29tL2Zyb250aWVyLXVudmVpbHMtbmV3LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIxbmVvLXdpdGgtZnVlbC1lZmZpY2llbnQtcHJhdHQtLXdoaXRuZXktZW5naW5lcy1hdC10cGEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Frontier Airlines celebrated the arrival of “America’s greenest aircraft” by revealing its new Airbus A321neo at Tampa International Airport on Tuesday.

The plane is powered by Pratt & Whitney’s ultra-efficient GTF engines and featuring a brand-new livery and unique tail animal – an American bald eagle that Frontier has named Frederick, after Pratt & Whitney founder Frederick Rentschler.

The airline officially unveiled the A321neo at the Airborne Maintenance Facility, where executives from Frontier, Airbus, Pratt & Whitney and TPA were in attendance.

“Frontier has been a strong partner with us for the last two decades,” Airport CEO Joe Lopano said. ""Their focus on growth, featuring the latest in technology the way this airplane does, fits in perfectly with our mission here at TPA.""

The plane’s new engines are expected to deliver nearly 120 miles per gallon per seat, exceeding airline industry averages and furthering Frontier’s efforts to reduce fuel consumption and lessen the company’s environmental footprint. The airline called the plane the most fuel-efficient commercial aircraft used among U.S. carriers.

The aircraft was built in Hamburg, Germany, and was receiving final checks and certifications at the Airborne facility; it will depart from the Airport later this week.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.989544689655304}",positive,0.989544689655304,1
Solestial closes $10 million round led by Airbus Ventures - SpaceNews,"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9zb2xlc3RpYWwtc2VlZC1yb3VuZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SAN FRANCISCO — Solestial, a Tempe, Arizona company focused on solar energy for space applications, closed a $10 million funding round led by Airbus Ventures. AEI HorizonX, GPVC, Stellar Ventures, Industrious Ventures and other investors participated in the round.

“With this seed round, we will fully validate the technology and then prepare ourselves to transition to mass production of solar cells and panels,” Stanislau Herasimenka, Solestial co-founder and CEO, told SpaceNews. “We will do a lot of ground testing to predict how our panels will perform. And we will have multiple flights over the next year.”

Solestial panels have not flown yet. The company has delivered three sets of panels to customers. Herasimenka declined to name the customers, but said they included prime contractors and well-funded startups.

“I’m very happy to see a strong demand from different segments of the satellite manufacturing market,” Herasimenko said. “It seems that solar is a pain not only for the LEO [low-Earth orbit] megaconstellations that we are primarily targeting because they need a lot. Everyone would benefit from more affordable solar panels in space.”

Solestial intends to offer solar panels that are much less expensive than current panels, “mass producible” and space stable, Herasimenka said. “In space, it can last for 10 years and preserve some reasonable performance.”

In contrast to existing space solar panels, which Herasimenko compares to Lamborghinis, Solestial aims to bring the space industry something less costly and easier to manufacture like a Ford F-150 pickup truck. “It can serve as the workhorse for this industry that’s expanding and needs a lot of solar power,” Herasimenko said.

Solestial, formerly known as Regher Solar, spun out of Arizona State University, where Herasimenka earned a PhD in electrical and electronics engineering, conducted post-doctoral research and served as an assistant research professor.

The company was developing thin silicon solar cells for terrestrial markets. Noting the rapid expansion of the space sector in recent years, the company began testing the impact of radiation on its technology. Like other solar cells, Solestial solar cells can be damaged by radiation, but the company designed the cells to anneal, or cure the defects, at normal operating temperatures.

In addition to private investment, Solestial has won Small Business Innovation Research awards from NASA, the National Science Foundation and other government agencies with a combined value of more than $2.5 million.

“We are at a new inflection point for the aerospace and the energy industries,” Mat Costes, Airbus Ventures partner, said in a statement. “We’re excited to welcome the team at Solestial into our vibrant community of entrepreneurs working to advance breakthrough technologies to help solve critical, near-term planetary challenges.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9964616894721985}",neutral,0.9964616894721985,0
Airbus C295 onboards the sustainability journey with a first demo flight with SAF - Airbus,"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTEwLWFpcmJ1cy1jMjk1LW9uYm9hcmRzLXRoZS1zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS1qb3VybmV5LXdpdGgtYS1maXJzdC1kZW1vLWZsaWdodNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus C295 is next in the race towards a more sustainable military aviation among Airbus Military Air Systems, following the first demo flight with SAF performed by Airbus A400M last summer. With a load of 29% blended SAF in its two engines, the C295 performed a successful first flight in Seville which helped to pave the way towards the final goal: to achieve 100% SAF capability for Airbus military aircraft and the decarbonisation of military aviation.

9.00 am on Wednesday, 19 October. The C295 team in charge of the SAF project met for an early morning briefing prior to the flight scheduled for that same day. The crew, the fuel team, engineers, pilots, flight test engineers… all gathered in the meeting room of the Airbus San Pablo Plant in Seville, going once again through the flight plan before take-off.

“With up to 50% of blended SAF, no modifications are required on the aircraft”, explained Jose Antonio Urbano, R&D Chief Engineer at Airbus Defence and Space. “So we are performing this demo flight to fully understand the aircraft behavior and to derive the necessary conclusion in preparation for future test campaigns with SAF”, he added.

The C295 would fly with a load of 29% blended SAF in both engines, so there was no need to modify the engines´ systems and the team faced no technical limitations on the preparation of the flight. “Although we know it would not be necessary with this SAF percentage used, the approach taken for this flight was to put the aircraft under the most demanding conditions in order to gather the necessary inputs for future 100% SAF operations. Our objective is to measure the aircraft performance with both fuels - Jet-A1 and SAF -, shut down and restarting the engines on flight, sudden movement of the power control levers to produce intense fuel demands, a rejected landing, manoeuvers of approach and go around after performing the final landing, requesting the maximum negative power”, explained Juan José Baeza, Flight Test Engineer at Airbus Defence and Space.

The wishes for a good flight concluded the briefing session. Then, the crew headed to the Flight Line, where the MSN163 awaited after having performed the requested ground tests and pre-flight tests on the previous days. The crew for this particular flight - Alejandro Grande, Alfonso de Castro, Pedro J. Martin and Juan J. Baeza - boarded the aircraft. Meanwhile, the team on the ground was busy with the refuelling manoeuvers, with a slight change on their normal procedure: The two PW127G engines of the MSN163 would be running, for the first time, with a load of 29% blended SAF.

Much like the A400M first flight with SAF conducted in July 2022, the drop-in fuel used for this flight is also the HEFA type (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acid) made of residuals of oils, vegetables and fats, and is also free of aromatics and sulphur. One of the main benefits of using SAF is reduced carbon emissions of 80% on average today over the entire lifecycle of the fuel.

Although the use of blended SAF doesn´t require any kind of technical modifications on the aircraft, challenges remain on the production side. “One of the biggest challenges we are currently facing is still the SAF supply. There is a high demand of SAF, but not many producers”, shared Urbano while MSN163 was still in the air. While SAF production currently accounts for only 0.1% of total aviation fuel production, this figure is expected to increase dramatically in the coming years to meet both growing demand from operators and upcoming SAF usage mandates.

After an almost two-hour flight, the MSN163 landed back in the Flight Line. Once on the ground, the crew nominated Baeza to proudly share the first impressions. “The flight has been of great value for us to prepare for future 100% SAF operations, and we feel privileged to be the ones to fly this aircraft with SAF onboard for the first time and be part of this exciting project”. Urbano echoed this feeling: “This demo flight helps us at Airbus Defence and Space to collect information and enable further research activities and technical work in order to reach the goal of 100% SAF capability for Airbus military aircraft”.

500,000 flight hours of the C295: The counter resets to `zero´

With 285 aircraft ordered and 38 operators in 34 different countries, the C295 has achieved more than 500,000 flight hours in all types of environments demonstrating the effectiveness and soundness of its system design. These are the amazing facts and figures of the `workhorse´. But now, as part of Airbus' commitment with the industry’s ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, it is time to reset the counter to `zero´ and start counting the more sustainable flight hours Airbus will bring among its military aircraft, on its path towards the final decarbonization of military aviation.

Another step on the roadmap to cleaner military operations was taken in January 2022, when the Airbus C295 Flight Test Bed 2 (FTB2), the in-flight demonstrator of the European Clean Sky 2 (CS2) and the EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, started a flight campaign as part of Airbus’ desire for a more sustainable future aviation. The modifications on the FTB2 included new materials and technologies designed to achieve reductions in noise, CO2 and NOx emissions - all to be applied on different platforms in the future.

Paving the way towards 100% SAF

With the first A400M demo flight with SAF in July 2022, Airbus Defence and Space with its Airbus Military Air Systems unit kicked-off a flight campaign aiming to assess the impact of unblended SAF on military aircraft in view of certifying the use of SAF blends that exceed today’s 50% limit.

“With SAF playing a predominant role in the short, medium and long-term for decarbonisation of aviation, these test flights are part of the ambitious cross-divisional and worldwide project that contributes to the Airbus purpose: to pioneer sustainable aerospace for a safe and united world”, said Jean-Brice Dumont, Head of Military Air Systems at Airbus Defence and Space.

In parallel to using drop-in SAF which is already approved for aircraft using up to 50% blend of SAF, Airbus is currently exploring the feasibility of higher concentrations. Studies are currently ongoing to understand the benefits of flying with 100% SAF before the end of the decade.

The Spanish Air Force flew its C-101 of the “Patrulla Águila” with SAF on board

During the Spanish National Day on the 12th of October, the C-101 of the Spanish Air Force, which are part of the so called “Patrulla Águila”, flew with a blend of SAF on board.

This milestone is the result of the activities and tests undertaken in Madrid and Albacete by the SAF working group of BACSI led by the Spanish Air Force in collaboration with Airbus, Repsol and ITP Aero.

The ​A400M, C295, A330, Eurofighter, NH90, etc.​ joined the aerial display during Spain's celebration of its ‘National Day’ on 12 October - ​#FiestaNacional​. Around 4,000 personell from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Guardia Civil and the Spanish Legionnaires marched along Madrid’s Paseo de la Castellana during the military parade. The day is also ‘Armed Forces Day’.

BACSI is the ""Connected, Sustainable and Intelligent Air Base"" initiative that aims to increase the effectiveness, productivity, efficiency and sustainability of the Spanish Air Force through innovation, including technological developments related to sustainable aviation fuel.

Airbus aims to collaborate and work together with its customers, and will remain part of BACSI and the SAF working group in the future to support in the development of knowledge and capabilities for the use of SAF in different Spanish Air Force combat aircraft platforms.

"The Airbus A300 Legacy, 50 Years After First Flight - Aviation Week","Wed, 19 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcmNyYWZ0LXByb3B1bHNpb24vYWlyYnVzLWEzMDAtbGVnYWN5LTUwLXllYXJzLWFmdGVyLWZpcnN0LWZsaWdodNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The incident happened early on in the flight-test program. On Dec. 6, 1972, pilots Jacques Grangette and Pierre Baud took off for the 17th sortie of the A300B1. Two flight-test engineers and a mechanic were also on board. Shortly after they started the day’s test program, the two pilots found that the aircraft reacted excessively when they initiated turns. Baud, a former fighter pilot who had joined Airbus just three months earlier, was not too worried, but Grangette decided to cancel the rest of the schedule and return to base.

Origins

In hindsight, there were many instances in which the A300 program—and with it the entire Airbus project—could have failed for technical, commercial and political reasons. Some are more well known, such as the struggle to launch the program via an extremely tedious process spanning most of the 1960s and then kickstarting enough sales momentum in the 1970s to allow a level of production that made some economic sense. That flight on Dec. 6 turned out to be one of the many lesser-known hiccups, but in some ways it was a close call for the program. More on that later.

On Oct. 28, 1972, the first A300B1 test aircraft took off on its first flight, marking the start of an industrial, political and ultimately economic success story that is called Airbus and continues today.

The A300 itself was no commercial success. The 561 orders for all A300 versions and another 251 for the A310 before the program was terminated after 35 years of production tell their own story. At peak demand, Airbus delivered 46 of the aircraft in 1982 but only 19 the next year. From 1997 on, annual output was mostly in the teens. But the A300 was the catalyst for the launch of Airbus and a more united European aerospace industry that would eventually be able to compete with the big players in the U.S. at the time: Boeing, Lockheed Martin and McDonnell Douglas. The enormity of that accomplishment is indicated by the fact that only one of the three initial competitors is still building commercial airplanes and that none of the other national or binational European projects such as the BAC 1-11, Caravelle, Concorde or Mercure were successful.

In addition to starting to integrate the European industry, the A300 marked technical and industrial milestones. It was the first European widebody aircraft, and it introduced the concept of only two engines on a widebody, an idea met with massive skepticism by the establishment for years and one of the reasons the airliner’s commercial breatkthrough took so long. “The Americans told us we were crazy,” Gerard Guyot, one of the initial A300B2 and -B4 flight-test engineers, remembers. Boeing followed up with the 767, which entered service in 1982 and later superseded the A300 because of its longer range.

In the early 1980s, Airbus also switched to a two-pilot cockpit from the traditional setup of three on the -B2 and -B4.

“The real reason why this aircraft was successful is because it brought something different to the market,” Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer says. A widebody with two engines was “a new economic proposition,” he asserts. For comparison, Scherer points to the introduction of the Comac C919 this year. While gaining technological sovereignty in aviation is perfectly legitimate for a country the size of China, as it was for Europe in the 1970s, “[the C919] is an imitation of something that already exists,” he says.

The A300 was the design primarily of three men: Henri Ziegler, Roger Beteille and Felix Kracht. Ziegler was named as the first CEO of the Airbus Industrie consortium, Beteille became chief operating officer, and Felix Kracht, who had played an important role in the background, headed production.

In 1967, Kracht became managing director of Deutsche Airbus, which was to consolidate Germany’s workshare in the upcoming program. Along with Beteille and Ziegler, he was the mastermind behind the A300B, a technically ambitious aircraft. He pushed to use the best technology available, wherever it came from. “If the Chinese have the best engine, we will use it,” he once said. Beteille, Ziegler and Kracht also agreed that Airbus would not succeed in the long term with only a single product. The A300 would have to be developed into a family of aircraft if the Europeans were to compete with Boeing, Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas. To say so publicly early on did not seem prudent politically, so they kept the idea to themselves initially.

Of course, the idea of the family concept and communality even across different types of aircraft has been an Airbus leitmotiv for decades.

Efforts to pull together the project in the first place took years, mainly because of industry politics. The UK was largely focused on developing Concorde, which many expected would be the future of civil aviation. Only Hawker Siddeley showed an interest in the A300 project. Germany was initially lukewarm at best. And even in France, the picture was complex: Dassault was aiming at the civil market with its Mercure project, an aircraft roughly the size of the A320 developed by Airbus later. Like in the UK, France was working on the Concorde, and anyone not immune to prestige thinking wanted to be on the program. When the first A300 test aircraft was rolled out along with another Concorde prototype in September 1972, no one really paid attention to the Airbus, even though Concorde had been in flight tests for some years.

Key airlines were underwhelmed, too. Air France did not want any political interference in its order decisions. Lufthansa chief Herbert Culmann also made it clear what he would do if he felt that kind of pressure: “If someone wants to force me to buy this Airbus, I will take my hat and leave tomorrow.”

Engine Trouble

The project nearly died several times. The original A300 was planned to have around 300 seats, aimed at large-volume, short- and medium-haul routes mainly in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, rather than the U.S., a market dominated by incumbents Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. The aircraft was supposed to be equipped with Rolls-Royce RB207 engines. But in May of 1968, the British engine-maker presented a price for the power-plant that was out of the question for Beteille and Ziegler. “The difference in price of the RB211 for the Lockheed L-1011 was simply unacceptable, and we realized that Rolls was playing another game without admitting it,” Beteille said at the time. “By continuing in that way, we would have ended up with nothing more than a superb glider.”

The high price was Rolls-Royce’s way of saying that it actually did not want to build an engine for the A300. The company was already building the RB211 for the Lockheed L-1011, a three-engine aircraft that would later compete with the first Airbus.

On Oct. 6, 1968. Ziegler hosted Beteille at his home on Avenue Stephane Mallarme in Paris. The two prepared major changes to rescue the project and decided to put forward the idea of a scaled-down version about 80% the size of the 300-seater. That way, the Airbus partners would spend less on development and be able to choose between two engines: the RB211 and the General Electric CF6. Given the tense relationship with Rolls-Royce, it was no surprise that Airbus came to an an agreement with GE. The Pratt & Whitney JT9D was added later as a second engine option in the program.

Decades later, Rolls-Royce played a role at Airbus as part of the International Aero Engines (IAE) consortium building the V2500 and then delivering the RB211-derived Trent engines for the A330, A350 and A380 widebodies.

On May 29, 1969, the French and German governments agreed on a memorandum of understanding at the Paris Air Show to jointly develop the A300B. At the time, it was not a momentous event: The news was buried in this magazine’s report on the Paris Air Show (AW&ST June 9, 1969, p. 33). But the Airbus project was a reality.

Following the engine sourcing, the quandary over the A300’s wings nearly ended the development program. While UK-based Hawker Siddeley was willing to take on the wing work, the British government refused to provide development money. The German government came to the rescue by agreeing to fund the work, removing one of the last major hurdles to program launch.

Taking Flight

Soon it was time for flight testing, but few people took notice. The first flight was scheduled for Friday, Oct. 27, but dense fog prevented the crew—pilots Max Fischl, Bernard Ziegler, flight-test engineers Gunter Scherer and Pierre Caneill and flight-test mechanic Romeo Zinzoni—from taking off. “No one was interested in the A300,” recalls Barbara Kracht, daughter of Airbus founder Felix Kracht who spent her entire professional career working for the company. In 1969, she was in university and was able to attend the first flight only because it was delayed to a Saturday, when she had no classes.

Not only did very few people actually witness the flight—at least compared to later first flights that were orchestrated as social media events—Airbus’ hometown newspaper La Depeche du Midi in Toulouse also buried the story on an inside page. This magazine did the same (AW&ST Nov. 6, 1972, p. 22).

The A300’s first sortie was remarkable in several ways. Fischl and Ziegler (Henri’s son, hailed by his colleagues as a formidable test pilot and equally capable boss) put the aircraft through a wide range of configurations, speeds and altitudes, switched the autopilot on and tested all the important systems. It was a more comprehensive program than would be undertaken on a first flight today. There was one unplanned aspect: As the weather deteriorated quickly, Fischl had to land the aircraft with a 28-kt. crosswind gusting to 34 kt. As it turned out, that was above the aircraft’s later certification limit. Baud, who witnessed the landing from his position on the apron, says Fischl did well to put the A300 back on the ground under the circumstances.

Christian Scherer, 10 years old at the time, watched the A300’s first takeoff and landing from the rooftop of the old Toulouse airport terminal building. His father, Gunter, was onboard as the flight-test engineer. “[I was] holding my mom’s hand,” Christian Scherer recalls, and noticed that the landing included “quite a bounce” and that the aircraft was “going sideways” on the final approach because of the crosswinds. Only about 25 other people had assembled on that platform.

Baud had just joined Airbus a month before the first flight, and like most of the test pilots, he was still very new to the program when he participated in his own first test flights. One of them, the 17th overall, proved to be a critical one. Grangette, who was in command, instinctively felt that the strong lateral moves could not be right. After landing, the available data was analyzed and extreme loads were discovered on Frame 90, where the tailplane and fin are attached to the fuselage. “Thanks to Grangette’s decision, a disaster was avoided,” Baud says.

The fix was rather straightforward. Frame 90 was reinforced and the settings for the spoilers and ailerons were reduced so that loads would be guaranteed to stay well below limits. The new configuration was validated on the 42nd flight in February 1973.

Another issue took somewhat longer to fix. During avoidance maneuvers at high altitude, pilots discovered a risk of the aircraft pitching up and causing them to lose control, a phenomenon discussed since early in the development. As it turned out, a shockwave disturbed lift at the tip of the wing, leading to a loss in speed and increased angle of attack. Airbus engineers found that the only way to reduce the shockwave was to add a wingtip.

Much to the chagrin of Airbus, French weekly news magazine L’Express argued that the A300 program should be scrapped because of the allegedly poorly designed wing. The paper’s founder and editor, Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, was a strong supporter of the Dassault Mercure project, so other considerations may have influenced his judgment of the wing situation.

The first two prototypes were A300B1s, but to make the aircraft more attractive to Air France, Airbus stretched the fuselage to accommodate three more seat rows, creating the B2. The third test aircraft was already a B2, a version that morphed into the B4 (with an added center fuel tank and Krueger flaps for additional range). The A300-600, introduced a decade later, involved a slight further stretch of the fuselage and featured several upgrades including the the forward-facing crew cockpit, Airbus’ move from a flight crew of three to two.

Tough Sell

Although flight testing was going smoothly overall, sales were not. Airbus was completely new to everyone in the industry. It launched demo tours around the world to introduce itself and the A300. The first was a monthlong Americas trip starting Sept. 15, 1973. Ziegler and Baud flew the aircraft from Toulouse to Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil (via Dakar, Senegal, and Recife, Brazil), to participate in a local air show. Guyot was also on board, as were mechanics, Airbus sales representatives—and a lot of spare parts, just in case.

“We were like an autonomous circus,” remarks Barbara Kracht, who was a member of the Airbus communications staff at the time.

“We were unknown, going from one city to another,” Guyot says.

Airbus was doing demo flights inviting pilots and local VIPs, trying to build trust in the aircraft and a lobby for future orders. “We were all driven by the same pioneer spirit,” Guyot says.

“What fascinated me was the emotional attachment to the mission,” Christian Scherer says of his father and colleagues. He says he was “in awe of the technology” as well as of the team’s ability to bridge cultures and come together. After all, his father was part of the first generation of German aeronautical engineers after World War II, who would not necessarily have been easily welcomed in France. But Gunter Scherer, who was a francophile, was an important player in building that bridge, his son recalls. And the members of French pilot school EPNER—in particular Jean Caillard, who became the elder Scherer’s mentor—received him with open arms. Gunter Scherer and Bernard Ziegler also later became best friends.

The A300B1 toured Brazil and some Caribbean destinations before stopping in West Palm Beach and Miami, Florida. Then, in Mexico City, Max Fischl’s piloting skills were required again: Upon takeoff from the high-altitude airport, an engine failed. Fischl turned the aircraft around, and mechanics repaired the engine. They were able to continue on the all-important U.S. tour as planned, with demos to Pan American World Airways, Trans World Airlines, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, among others. But it would be several more years before Airbus would achieve its commercial breakthrough in the U.S.

Following the Americas tour, Airbus sent an aircraft to Southern Africa with stops in Niamey, Niger; Libreville, Gabon; Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban, South Africa; Kinshasa, Democratic Repulic of Congo; and Windhoek, Namibia. The Windhoek stop was also used for takeoff performance tests at high altitude.

Certification and Production

May 1974 proved to be full of milestones for the aircraft. Following certification by France and Germany in March, the A300 was certified by the U.S. FAA. Airbus embarked on a third demo tour, this time to the Asia-Pacific region, with many stops in Southeast Asia, South Korea, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. On May 10, Air France took delivery of its first B2 and started commercial services on May 30, operating the aircraft initially on the Paris-London route.

Things did not become easier for Airbus, however. “Most airlines were reticent about a twin-engine widebody carrying so many passengers,” Baud says. All widebodies at the time had at least three engines, and the Boeing 747 had four. Even the short- and medium-haul Boeing 727 was a three-engine aircraft. Beteille, Ziegler and Kracht were convinced nonetheless that they had the more efficient design and that the aircraft would be easier to repair than one with one engine installed high up on the tailplane. “We had to change the mindset of the airlines,” Baud notes.

That effort took years. During the first six years of production, Airbus built more A300s than it delivered, parking expensive “white-tails” waiting to be sold and handed over. Between 1974 and 1979, Airbus delivered fewer than 90 aircraft. The low point was 1976; Airbus did not receive a single order between the end of 1975 and mid-1977. Production was reduced to a nominal rate of just 0.5 aircraft per month, nowhere near any kind of profitable level. By comparison, after decades of industrial optimization, currently Airbus is not making money at a rate of five aircraft per month on the A350 program.

Into Operation

Air France was the first operator in 1974, followed by Air Siam at the end of the year. Korean Air and Hapag-Lloyd took their first A300s in 1975, and then Lufthansa, Air Inter, Indian Airlines and South African Airways the next year. At least some of the demo tours appeared to have paid off, with a good part of the early deliveries going to carriers in Asia, as Airbus had hoped, given the route structures and need to connect large metropolitan areas with high-capacity aircraft. Air Siam was a case in point: The carrier had leased aircraft MSN 8 for nine months to fly the Bangkok-Hong Kong route—the A300’s first extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards service early on in its operational history. The U.S. remained closed to the A300 for the time being.

In 1975, Bernard Lathiere took over the top position at Airbus from Henri Ziegler. He warned internally that the situation had to improve, and fast. Baud remembers people leaving the flight-test department that year because there was not enough work for everyone. But Lathiere, born in Kolkata (then Calcutta), India, turned out to be in the right place at the right time, as he excelled at what Airbus needed most in the mid-1970s: sales brilliance. Seeing that none of the other U.S. carriers were prepared to go for the A300, Lathiere approached the CEO of Eastern Air Lines, Frank Borman, a former astronaut. The carrier had not made money in 10 years but needed new aircraft, and Lathiere saw an opportunity.

The two agreed on a deal that is legendary to this day and one of the reasons why Airbus still exists. The OEM sent four A300s to Eastern to test in commercial operations free of charge for six months. The test satisfied Borman, and not only did Eastern buy the four aircraft, it ordered 23 more in 1977. The order gave Airbus the credibility it needed to build sales momentum over the coming years and put it in position to expand its portfolio further and build the A320, which was launched in 1984.

Christian Scherer joined Airbus as an intern in the contracts department in September 1984. His first assignment was the final paperwork for the PanAm order for 12 A300B4s. Then, on Dec. 21, four aircraft were delivered the same day. One was going to Berlin for PanAm’s air bridge service, and three more flew to New York via Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador. Scherer was on board of one of them. He recalls seeing the three parked next to each other during a refueling stop in a snowstorm at Gander: “That was one of the most emotional moments of my career.”","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.7570182681083679}",negative,0.7570182681083679,-1

The airline is currently operating an all-Airbus fleet of 116 A320 Family aircraft.

Using the power of the Skywise aviation data platform, Skywise Health Monitoring collates and centralises maintenance warnings and alerts in real time. SHM can correlate alerts and indicate if they are related. With each event, a history of recent flights enables identification of repetitive incidents, and the system also provides a full view of related technical documentation. Monitoring in real time helps ground staff to make appropriate decisions based on criticality, logistics and upcoming maintenance checks, and, if necessary, prepare in advance forrepairs and replacements - all before the aircraft has even landed.

“By using SHM, Volaris will benefit from all the advantages the platform offers to optimise maintenance operations with a focus on unscheduled maintenance. Skywise Health Monitoring saves airlines time and decreases the cost of unscheduled maintenance thanks to data-driven decisions” said David Marty, Head of Airbus Digital Solutions Sales and Marketing.

In addition to these data-driven benefits, safety plays a key role, as it is our permanent and unwavering commitment in every operation

said Holger Blankenstein, executive Vice President of Volaris Airlines.

Second batch of Airbus' Sparkwing solar panels selected by Aerospacelab to accommodate serial production of satellites - Airbus,"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTEwLXNlY29uZC1iYXRjaC1vZi1haXJidXMtc3Bhcmt3aW5nLXNvbGFyLXBhbmVscy1zZWxlY3RlZC1ieS1hZXJvc3BhY2VsYWItdG_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An additional six of Airbus’ Sparkwing solar panels have been selected by Aerospacelab to accommodate their ramp up towards higher satellite production volumes. The panels are designed and produced at Airbus’ Dutch site in Leiden. The ordered configuration, consisting of two single panel wings, each measuring 1070x570mm, is identical to the set recently delivered by Airbus for the first flight model of Aerospacelab’s Very High Resolution (VHR) mission.

The stiffness of the solar panels concept for small satellites is key for Aerospacelab’s VHR mission, which requires high agility and stability of the platform as it allows for better quality pictures in quicker succession. This feature is brought in by an intelligently designed hinge that provides a high stiffness design out of a very small volume. Further, the minimal integration effort needed for the solar panels is an asset in the satellite’s assembly and integration flow, especially during the envisaged production ramp up at the megafactory that Aerospacelab opened in Belgium this summer.

Rob Postma, Chief Executive Office of Airbus Defence and Space Netherlands: “We are happy to see the first customer of this product coming back for a follow-on order. It confirms that the delivery of our initial flight model has been well received. We see that our catalogue approach for small satellites, strong supply chain support and short through-put times, lower the risks for our customer and produce a reliable solution. It proves that our fully qualified product can deliver on its promise of “Space made easy”. We look forward to extending our good relationship with Aerospacelab for a continued collaboration.”

Established in Belgium, Switzerland and France, Aerospacelab is a fast-growing company created in 2018, counting more than 140 full time employees. With a unique vertically integrated approach, Aerospacelab is specialized in satellite platforms and geospatial intelligence. It designs, manufactures, and operates constellations of remote sensing satellites, empowering intelligence and insights by its proprietary satellite data.

“The smartly designed solar panel concept supports Aerospacelab in accomplishing the manufacturing of affordable and high-performance satellites. The pragmatic approach was in line with our serial production objectives, so we are very grateful to be able to have Sparkwing for the next six flight sets,” said Benoit Deper, Aerospacelab founder and CEO. “We have been impressed by Airbus’ ability to produce commercially available, off-the-shelf solar array for LEO small satellites, and are looking forward to a fruitful relationship.”

Sparkwing is the world’s first commercially available, off-the-shelf solar array for small satellites. It is optimised for Low Earth Orbit missions that require power levels between 100W and 2000W. It offers customers a choice of more than thirty different panel dimensions, configurable into deployable wings with one, two or three panels per wing.

Next to power generation, the solar array product provides a high stiffness, single actuation need (due to only one hold-down per wing), minimal integration effort (made for integration by the customer) and gentle demands on the spacecraft sidewall tolerances. Sparkwing is a product developed by Airbus Defence and Space Netherlands B.V., with the support of the Netherlands Space Office and ESA.

Saving lives with the five-bladed H145 in New Zealand - Airbus,"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTEwLXNhdmluZy1saXZlcy13aXRoLXRoZS1maXZlLWJsYWRlZC1oMTQ1LWluLW5ldy16ZWFsYW5k0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It was a windy night on the south island of New Zealand - Duncan Gourley was on duty for the operator Heli Otago. “We had a primary mission to fly from Taieri Airport to Stewart Island to pick up a patient who was suffering from a heart attack, and then transfer him to Dunedin Hospital. ” With changing weather, gusts up to 75 kts and low temperatures, the conditions were challenging for the team, forcing them to use low level IFR routes and a GPS-led approach into Stewart Island. “The mission took more than three hours, due to the weather. In the end, we managed to stabilise the patient in the helicopter with advanced life-saving care, and were able to transfer him to the hospital, where they continued treatment. It was thanks to the H145 that we managed it; with a less capable system, I’m sure we would have been forced to abort.” Gourley adds: “The H145 is the most capable helicopter I’ve ever flown, and the five-bladed version is the smoothest. The Helionix system coupled with the airframe design of the H145 offers great peace of mind especially when operating under IFR conditions. ”

Dream destination but challenging conditions



New Zealand, with its otherworldly landscapes, green vallies and white beaches is a dream destination for thousands of visitors from around the world. But when it comes to flying helicopters, it has its fair share of challenges, especially when the missions include Helicopter Emergency Medical Services. “New Zealand is made up of very changeable topography and weather, with mountains to the west that climb up to 12,000 ft (more than 3,500 metres) and very low freezing levels making for challenging conditions”, says Duncan Gourley, Pilot at Heli Otago with more than 4,500 flight hours on the H145 family of helicopters. “We also fly at night, 24/7, at any time of the year. For this, we operate our helicopters in a mixture of visual flight rules and instrument flight rules (IFR)/performance-based navigation (PBN), depending on the conditions we face.”

Performance-based navigation allows the operator to fly the aircraft along a precise flight path with a high level of accuracy and ability to determine the aircraft’s position. When low-level IFR routes exist and the helicopters are suitably equipped and certified, operators can keep their helicopters in lower, warmer air, which reduces encounters with icing conditions. “On top of that, we rely on night vision goggles, which are an essential tool for us since we operate day and night, often in unknown areas”, Gourley adds.

Heli Otago: More than 30 years of experience operating helicopters



Heli Otago has been operating in the Otago and Southland regions of New Zealand since 1990 and is one of the biggest helicopter operators in the country. For its missions, which ranges from air charters, agricultural missions to training and air ambulance operations, the company relies on a fleet of more than 15 helicopters. Since 1998, Heli Otago has been successfully operating the Air Ambulance and Rescue Helicopter service for the lower South Island. The HEMS operations are always on standby, ready to respond to serious accidents, medical emergencies, search and rescue missions or inter-hospital transfers, providing paramedic care for a range of over 66,500 square kilometres. For these missions, Heli Otago has a fleet of BK117 helicopters, and since 2017 an EC145. In 2019 the operator added a four-bladed H145, which has clocked in more than 3,200 flight hours in just over three years, with an availability well above 90%. And now, they have added the five-bladed H145.

Five-bladed H145: A real game changer



“It was an easy decision to choose the five-bladed H145 as our latest helicopter: the transition is pretty easy from our other H145 family of helicopters; the single-engine performance and the overall performance of the helicopter is fantastic for the safety of our operations. The autopilot and the Helionix system of the five-bladed H145 have proven to be a real game changer, especially for our IFR/PBN missions”, says Graeme Gale, Owner and Pilot at Helicopters Otago Ltd.

The maintenance plan for the new H145 is also facilitated for the operator, reducing the need for technical interventions and costly repairs. “The new rotor system requires less maintenance due to the modern design incorporating elastomeric bearings and composite materials. Less vibration should decrease long-term maintenance and repair costs due to less fatigue on the airframe and components. And the increase in useful load means we can carry larger payloads or carry more fuel, increasing the efficiency of our operations.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9900853633880615}",neutral,0.9900853633880615,0

DALLAS – Airbus has announced its adjusted earnings for the third quarter of 2022, increasing profits to €599m (US$596m). For the first nine months of the year, revenues had also increased by 5% to €2.87bn (US$2.85bn).

Revenues for its commercial aircraft business also rose 8% to €26.6bn (US$26.4bn) for the first nine months of 2022.

Airbus said this was mainly due to “the higher number of deliveries including a favorable mix and the strengthening of the US dollar.”

Supply Chain Fragility

Guillaume Faury, Airbus CEO, said, “Airbus delivered a solid nine-month 2022 financial performance in a complex operating environment. The supply chain remains fragile resulting from the cumulative impact of COVID, the war in Ukraine, energy supply issues and constrained labour markets.”

The CEO added, “Our strong focus on cash flow and the favourable dollar/euro environment have enabled us to raise our free cash flow guidance for 2022. The commercial aircraft delivery and earnings targets are maintained. Our teams are focused on our key priorities and in particular, delivering the commercial aircraft ramp-up over the coming months and years.”

Its gross commercial aircraft orders increased to 856 this year, with net orders of 647 after cancellations. The European manufacturer now has an order backlog of 7,294 commercial aircraft at the end of September 2022.

A321XLR Entry into Service Update

Meanwhile, Mr. Faury has also given an update on the expected entry into service (EIS) of its A321XLR. Airbus had hoped that the airliner would enter service in 2023. In May, it was announced that this would be pushed back to early 2024.

Three prototypes are now taking part in the test certification program. However, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has asked Airbus to look at potential fire risks posed by the aircraft’s additional fuel tank, delaying the EIS to the second quarter of 2024

The manufacturer also added that its A320neo family production rate is on track to meet its target of 65 aircraft per month by early 2024, rising to 75 in 2025. In the statement, Airbus said, “The groundwork continues throughout all sites to secure rate 75 and adapt to the higher proportion of A321s in the backlog, ensuring all A320 Family Final Assembly Lines become A321 capable.”

DALLAS – Something big has landed at Orlando Sanford International Airport (SFB)—the Airbus BelugaST, one of the world’s largest transport aircraft.

The aircraft is scheduled to arrive at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) early tomorrow morning to deliver an Airbus-built satellite that is part of a key forthcoming space mission.

This is a momentous event for Airbus as it is the first time the Beluga has returned to the US and the KSC in 14 years. In addition, as the Beluga arrives, another Airbus-built satellite will sit atop a rocket set to launch from KSC at midnight today.

BelugaST Operations

The Airbus Beluga fleet has been operating successfully for more than 20 years. The type was exclusively dedicated to the transport of structures for Airbus aircraft.

Then, in December 2021, Airbus launched its cargo division using its A300-600ST fleet, with its own Air Operator Certificate (AOC) and personnel, to offer a solution to outsized freight transportation services worldwide.

The launch of the general oversized air freight service took place during the last week of the year, when Beluga “No. 3” delivered a new helicopter from Airbus Helicopters’ manufacturing site in Marignane, France, halfway across the world to Kobe in Japan.

Along the way, the Beluga stopped to refuel at various transit points – including Warsaw (in Poland), Novosibirsk (in Russia), and Seoul (in Korea). Notably, the whole helicopter could be accommodated inside the Beluga without any prior disassembly — only needing its long rotor blades to be folded back.

At the end of July, Brazil received for the first time the Airbus A300-600ST as it performed its first cargo operation to the region transporting three helicopters.

Florida Touchdown

Orlando Sanford International Airport was built as Naval Air Station Sanford, a Master Jet Base for carrier-based attack and reconnaissance aircraft, and was used by the U.S. Navy until 1969. The distance between SFB and KSC is 39 miles.

Airways will cover a press conference that will be held Monday at 7 a.m. EST to learn more about the satellite mission and Beluga transport from Airbus executives.

If you’re in the Orlando area, grab your cameras and shoot some images of the BelugaST at SFB or tomorrow at KSC and share them with us on our social media channels, and we will update Monday’s coverage with the best shots!

Weather monitoring counts on a powerful new tool - Airbus,"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTEwLXdlYXRoZXItbW9uaXRvcmluZy1jb3VudHMtb24tYS1wb3dlcmZ1bC1uZXctdG9vbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 25 October 2022 - Four times more precise than its predecessor, IASI-NG will provide vital data for weather forecasting, pollution monitoring and climate research. A true partnership between Airbus and French Space Agency CNES, the Airbus team has just integrated the first IASI-NG flight optical instrument onto the MetOp-SG weather satellite ‘A’ that will carry it into space.

The most complex of the satellite’s instruments, IASI-NG is the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer: it will determine temperature and water vapour profiles in the atmosphere, record ocean surface and land temperatures and monitor a wide range of chemical compounds and other key variables for climate research, including greenhouse gases, desert dust and cloud cover. Two other IASI-NG instruments will later equip the two next MetOp-SG satellites A to cover more than 20 years of weather and environment monitoring.

“At Airbus, we constantly aim at providing the best technological solutions to scientists around the world to better understand the processes that determine the planet’s climate,” said Philippe Pham, Head of Earth Observation and Science at Airbus. “IASI-NG will be a key instrument for weather forecasting and to monitor the climate’s health at any moment in time to secure life and property on Earth.”

Why do we need IASI-NG?

IASI-NG's ability to detect and accurately measure the levels and circulation patterns of gases that are known to influence the climate will be invaluable to scientists. In parallel, this Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer will measure atmospheric temperature and moisture, and trace gases such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, methane and ozone, giving a full picture of the atmosphere’s characteristics at any given time.

Picture

How does it work?

IASI-NG is a state-of-the-art, sophisticated sounding instrument that will be used for global measurements of atmospheric temperature and moisture with unprecedented accuracy and spectral resolution to improve weather prediction. The optical interferometry process offers fine spectral samplings of the atmosphere in the infrared band between the wavelengths of 3.2 and 15.5 microns. This enables the instrument to establish temperature and water vapour profiles in the troposphere and the lower stratosphere, as well as measure concentrations of ozone, carbon monoxide, methane and other compounds. The instrument should provide nearly an order of magnitude improvement in the vertical resolution of temperature and humidity profiles in the atmosphere, which will result in significant improvements in weather forecasts. Twenty years of invaluable climate data MetOp-SG is a continuation of the successful MetOp first generation series of satellites, which currently provide critical meteorological observations from polar orbit. These valuable contributions will be enhanced and provided by the MetOp-SG satellites from mid-2020 up to the 2040s. MetOp-SG consists of two, parallel series of satellites (A and B), with three in each series. The A series, being built at Airbus in Toulouse, carries atmospheric sounders and optical/infrared imagers, while the B series, under construction at Airbus in Friedrichshafen in southern Germany, focuses on microwaves. MetOp-SG is a cooperative undertaking between the European Space Agency (ESA) and EUMETSAT, the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites. The first launch of the MetOp-SG mission is scheduled for 2025 after completion of integration and satellite level testing. The nominal operational lifetime of each MetOp-SG satellite is 7.5 years, ensuring full operational coverage over a 21-year period. IASI-NG integration operations - Copyright Airbus

Tamarack Eyes Airbus A320s For Active Winglet Upgrade - Aviation Week,"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9zaG93bmV3cy9uYmFhL3RhbWFyYWNrLWV5ZXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjBzLWFjdGl2ZS13aW5nbGV0LXVwZ3JhZGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ORLANDO—Active winglet manufacturer Tamarack Aerospace Group says it is assembling a “coalition” of airlines and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) operators to help offer its technology for retrofit of Airbus A320 narrowbody airliners.

Speaking with reporters Oct. 17 at the NBAA Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition (NBAA-BACE), Tamarack founder and CEO Nick Guida said his company has placed fuel-saving winglet extensions on nearly 10% of Cessna Citation-series business jets, positioning it to target a $10 billion addressable market for A320s.

“We’re going after the A320,” Guida said. “Now that we have 170 aircraft flying and we’re creeping up on 10% of the addressable fleet of Citations, it’s hard to discount us.”

Tamarack led off its press conference by announcing a memorandum of understanding with hybrid-electric aircraft developer Ampaire to provide its winglets for Ampaire’s Eco Caravan, Eco Otter and Eco King Air conversions. The companies said joint development work has already begun.

Tamarack also reported being in active talks with three presales purchasers of Beechcraft King Air 200 and 300 turboprops slated for its Smartwing upgrade. In September, the Sandpoint, Idaho-based company announced the first active winglet retrofit of Textron Aviation’s Citation M2 Gen2.

Active winglets dynamically respond to changing loads and conditions, optimizing an aircraft’s aerodynamic efficiency by increasing lift and reducing drag. The modification reduces fuel burn and associated CO 2 emissions. Tamarack says the efficiency gains are three or four times that of passive winglets.

Guida said A320-family and Boeing 737 narrowbody airliners are responsible for most of aviation’s CO 2 emissions, presenting the company with an opportunity to offer active winglets for sustainability objectives. Tamarack in past years has held discussions with Airbus about the winglet upgrade, he said, but “couldn’t get past” an intellectual property issue with its patented technology.

Tamarack envisions a 2.5-year process to certify the modification on A320s, an effort that Guida compared to Aviation Partners’ Blended Winglet adaptation of Boeing Business Jets. “Our team is not worried about upsetting Airbus; we’re just worried about getting a plane in the air,” he said. “We’re just following the same path that Aviation Partners did.”

The coalition of airlines and MROs Tamarack is assembling will have “big names that derisk this whole thing for everyone,” and provide both capital investment and in-kind services, Guida said. “We have 32 people at Sandpoint; we can’t do it ourselves.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999297857284546}",neutral,0.9999297857284546,0

The Airbus Beluga ST is one of the largest currently operational aircraft based on the volume of its cargo hold, making it even more impressive when viewed from space. The Beluga was delivering the Hotbird 13G satellite to KSC on behalf of telecommunications giant Eutelsat.

Images captured by an Earth observation satellite operated by France's National Center for Space Studies (CNES) show the whale of an aircraft completely dwarfing everything around it as it dropped off the satellite at on Saturday (Oct. 15).

The Airbus A300-600ST (Super Transporter), or Beluga, made its first flight in 1994. According to Airbus, it measures 184 feet (56 meters) in length and has a wingspan of 147 feet (44.8 m). The massive cargo jet can carry payloads weighing up to 44 tons (40 tonnes) and measuring 22 by 23 by 127 feet (6.7 by 7.1 by 39 m). The cargo area even features a special heating module that can be used when sensitive payloads that require climate controls are being transported, ensuring they aren't damaged in flight. Only five Belugas have been built to date.

The Airbus A300 In-Service Fleet By The Numbers - Aviation Week,"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcmxpbmVzLWxlc3NvcnMvYWlyYnVzLWEzMDAtc2VydmljZS1mbGVldC1udW1iZXJz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tracking in-service aircraft and fleet types is usually not difficult using databases such as Aviation Week’s Fleet Discovery. But digging out the details of the Airbus A300 in-service fleet 50 years after its first flight is complicated, and results have to be taken with some caution. Information about whether an aircraft is still flying often varies from source to source. And with a significant part of the fleet operating in Iran and Russia, even Airbus has only limited access to information, given that the sanctions imposed on those countries essentially allow no dealings with the operators there.

According to Airbus’ latest operational statistics for September, a total of 229 A300s remain in operation worldwide. Fleet Discovery allows a more detailed look at the actual status of the aircraft: it lists 182 as in service, 24 in parked or parked-reserve status and 23 more in long-term storage. Fifty-four A310s are still flying, Airbus says. Of the A300s, the vast majority are freighters.

FedEx is by some margin the largest remaining operator of the type, with 70 of the aircraft. It is followed by UPS with 52 and European Air Transport (operating on behalf of DHL) with 22. Because Iranian airlines in general have been all but unable to modernize their fleets, they have been forced to stick with their aircraft much longer. That has led to Iran becoming home to the largest A300 passenger aircraft fleet, with 21 still flying in the country, according to Airbus.

There are 38 remaining operators of the A300, and the in-service fleet is 28 years old on average. An A300 typically flies about 500 cycles or 878 hr. per year, reflecting its roles at FedEx and UPS: domestic cargo flights averaging just under 2 hr. and no more than 2-3 sectors per day. There are no extended-range twin-engine operations performance standards flights anymore.

Airbus figures show that MSN 80, registered as EP-IBS, is the oldest active A300. The aircraft is one of only two A300B2s still shown as in service. However, according to Aviation Week’s Tracked Aircraft Utilization tool, MSN 80 has not flown since December 2020. MSN 141, an A300B4 owned by Galaxy Aviation, is the second-oldest, having been delivered in 1981 (initially to Thai Airways).

The last A300 built is MSN 878, delivered to FedEx in July of 2007. Since then, the aircraft has flown 11,507 cycles and 20,364 hr. Forty-four aircraft are younger than 20 years; another 121 are between 20 and 30 years old.

Some of the early aircraft are slowly reaching the end of their service lives. The A300B4 was initially designed for 34,000 cycles and 70,000 hr.; Airbus later introduced an extended service goal of 57,000 cycles and 118,000 hr. The A300-600’s design service goal (SDG) was 30,000 cycles and 67,500 hr., but the manufacturer extended its limit twice. It is now at 51,000 cycles and 89,000 hr. The company has no plans to extend A300-600’s SDG again, given the limited number of aircraft affected. The large operators, in particular FedEx and UPS, have relatively young fleets and are generally far from reaching the cycle or hourly limits of their aircraft.

In fact, UPS is making substantial investments in its A300 fleet. The airline launched a major cockpit upgrade program in 2015 that included new screens, a flight management system and weather radar, as well as an enhanced ground-proximity warning system and other changes. The majority of the fleet has been retrofitted by now, but the program is still ongoing.

At Airbus, the A300 (and A310) fleets are being managed by the out-of-production organization that is also handling the A380. They do not manage the A340, since it is seen as a sister program to the A330, which is still being built. Pascal Vialleton, the A300 head of program and chief engineer who also runs the technical directorate, says no new maintenance or in-service issues have surfaced for some time as the program is “very mature.” But ensuring spares availability has become a challenge. When manufacturing of a specific part has to be relaunched, the directorate turns the initial design drawings into digital 3D models as it retro-engineers the parts.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999977350234985}",neutral,0.9999977350234985,0

"Airbus is giving almost all of its employees, including senior managers, a $1,490 cash bonus to deal with rising inflation - Fortune","Tue, 25 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8yNS9haXJidXMtZW1wbG95ZWVzLWJvbnVzLXJpc2luZy1pbmZsYXRpb24v0gFLaHR0cHM6Ly9mb3J0dW5lLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEwLzI1L2FpcmJ1cy1lbXBsb3llZXMtYm9udXMtcmlzaW5nLWluZmxhdGlvbi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A number of companies have given their employees a one-off payment this year in hopes of softening the blow of skyrocketing inflation.

European airplane maker Airbus plans to give its employees a €1,500 bonus ($1,494) by the end of this year, according to French newspaper Le Figaro and French news agency Agence France-Presse. The bonus will go to nearly all of the company’s 126,000 employees, including senior management, in Germany, France, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Employees based elsewhere will also receive a bonus, but it will be based on the local average base salaries of those workers.

“The volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity that characterizes our environment have been further reinforced in recent months by the energy crisis and inflation,” Airbus said in a memo obtained by the French news outlets.

U.K. inflation rose 10.1% in September from the previous year. Germany’s rose 10% in the same period, and the overall eurozone’s annual inflation rate was 9.9%—driven mostly by surging energy costs. After invading Ukraine, Russia was hit with sanctions by Western nations. It responded by cutting its supply of natural gas to Europe, sending the continent spiraling into an energy crisis.

Europe’s ongoing economic troubles don’t seem like they’ll go away anytime soon. Inflation remains stubbornly high, and central banks are working to lower it by raising interest rates, all the while the war in Ukraine continues.

“The company believes that this solution is the most appropriate to support employees in the short term as they cope with the current inflationary environment,” an Airbus spokesperson told Insider.

Despite the potential financial hit companies take by awarding one-time employee bonuses, it’s something several European businesses—especially banks and financial services institutions—have said they would do.

Virgin Money and HSBC, both British banks, over the summer said they planned to give some employees one-time payments of £1,000 ($1,147) and £1,500 ($1,721), respectively, to help them stay afloat. Earlier, Lloyds Banking (a U.K. financial institution) said it would give a one-time payment of £1,000 ($1,147) to all staff, except for senior executives.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997169375419617}",neutral,0.9997169375419617,0

"Three missions, one aircraft: Airbus A400M shows its potential in the UK - Airbus","Tue, 11 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTEwLXRocmVlLW1pc3Npb25zLW9uZS1haXJjcmFmdC1haXJidXMtYTQwMG0tc2hvd3MtaXRzLXBvdGVudGlhbC1pbi10aGUtdWvSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As part of its commitment with the countries operating the A400M under the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR), Airbus Defence and Space successfully completed a Crew Workload Assessment mission conducted in the UK. Performed by the Airbus MSN6 prototype, and operated from Royal Air Force (RAF) Brize Norton, the objective was to evaluate the crew workload while performing the three key tactical capabilities ofthe A400Mon one single flight: Aerial Delivery, Low-level Flight and Air-to-air refuelling.

Omne Trinum est Perfectum. This Latin phrase means that everything that comes in `threes´ is perfect, or, every set of three is complete, could be easily applied when referring to the A400M. The aircraft responds to a highly varied needs of world Air Forces and other organisations as it performs three very different types of duties: tactical and strategic missions directly to the site of action, as well as air-to-air refuelling. Three key capabilities that describe the whole potential of an A400M.

On 26 September, the Airbus prototype MSN6 took off from the San Pablo plant in Seville. Its destination: Royal Air Force Brize Norton airfield, our host and witness of this complex mission. The MSN6 proudly shows, painted on its fuselage, the flags of the 10 different countries that already have chosen the A400M. Ahead, one more day for a final check over the flight plan for Wednesday, 28 September.

The A400M can perform missions which previously required two - or more - different types of aircraft, and is capable of manoeuvres that many would not expect from a transport aircraft of its size. The Crew Workload Assessment mission represents the operational summary of the A400M capability, as it includes the workload evaluation of its three key tactical missions and features in flight: Aerial Delivery, Low-level Flight and Air-to-air refuelling. “This mission has particular importance as it provides our customers with distinct confirmation and confidence in the maturity of the A400M as a modern and capable tactical asset,” explained Simon Nicastro, A400M Flight & Integration Test Programme Manager at Airbus.

Crew Workload Assessment: A `3 in 1´ mission

During this exercise, the A400M flexed its muscles over UK skies showing how it excels when it comes to speed and height. Flying over Scotland, the first phase of the flight included aerial refuelling with the MSN6 acting as a receiver from a RAF A330 MRTT Voyager tanker. Rapidly changing operational scenarios required rapid changing configuration and, although it was not tested in this mission, the built-in air-to-air refuelling capability allows the aircraft to be also rapidly reconfigured to become a tanker, an adaptability which is unique to the A400M.

Once refuelled, during the second part of the flight, the MSN6 demonstrated how, despite its weight, it was able to conduct a steep descent and a low-level flight. This unique capability for a military transport aircraft improves the A400M’s terrain masking and survivability, making the aircraft less detectable in hostile areas and less susceptible to threats when cruising towards key military operations.

As part of its commitment with the countries operating the A400M under the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR), Airbus Defence and Space successfully completed a Crew Workload Assessment mission conducted in the UK. Performed by the Airbus MSN6 prototype, and operated from Royal Air Force (RAF) Brize Norton, the objective was to evaluate the crew workload while performing the three key tactical capabilities of the A400M on one single flight: Aerial Delivery, Low-level Flight and Air-to-air refuelling.

For the last phase of the flight, the MSN6 showed what it is capable of when `playing´ with both speed and height. During this phase, four loads of 1 tonne each were dropped over a controlled drop zone from the cargo hold. The type’s low-speed characteristics make the A400M ideal for dropping supplies from low altitude, assuring a very rapid and direct response to any occurrence and, once on the ground, is designed for very rapid cargo unloading or loading without any specialised ground support equipment, minimising the aircraft’s vulnerability to hostile action.

This whole mission was conducted by the minimum crew required for the task: two pilots and one loadmaster assisted by two qualified cargo crew, having also on board at the controls the crew authorities from the Certification and Qualification Organisation (CQO) in order to confirm the acceptability of workload results. “During the flight, the crew received a replanning order to avoid a certain area simulating a ground threat, and also to modify the load delivery in order to be representative of a complex operational mission our customers could face in a real scenario,” explained César González, Flight Test Engineer on board. “All objectives were accomplished and the mission was fully successful, revealing that the crew workload was fully acceptable for this kind of complex operation,” he added.

For such a mission, there is an experienced team behind working in perfect harmony with the customer. “This is the last complex campaign to coordinate and execute with our customers, involving a significant amount of Government Furnished Facilities (GFF) provided by the UK MoD and the Royal Air Force, including aerial delivery loads, a Voyager tanker and several military zones. It has been a tremendous effort and a huge success for the entire Airbus team and another example of `We are ONE´ with our customers,” said David Ferro, A400M Chief Engineer at Airbus.

Once the mission was accomplished, the MSN6 headed back to its hangar in Seville, awaiting for the next challenge to come.

Parachuting, another key capability tested by the Royal Air Force with its A400M

Parachuting remains a key capability for current military operations. Recently, paratroopers of the RAF made the first low-level parachute descents from the Royal Air Force’s A400M, as it will be the aircraft to deliver the military’s parachuting capability in 2023.

The trials had been planned and delivered by No. 206 Squadron, the RAF’s heavy aircraft test and evaluation squadron and the Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit. RAF dispatches from the Parachute Test Team assisted the parachutists in the safe fitting and checking of equipment, conducting final checks prior to despatch, and ensuring the safe despatch of parachutists from the aircraft before recovering their static lines.

The A400M excels in the parachuting role, as it is able to carry more paratroopers over a greater distance, a capability that reinforces the strategic value the A400M already offers to air force operators and society.

The 21st A400M for UK, delivered to the Royal Air Force

With the MSN056 delivered this week to the UK, the Royal Air Force has now taken delivery of 21 of the 22 A400M on order.

Since the first A400M delivery to the UK back in 2014, the Royal Air Force has performed several key missions having this new generation airlifter as a big asset and highlighting its reach and payload. During Kabul´s evacuation, the UK’s RAF evacuated more than 15,000 people with more than 100 evacuation flights, 31 of which were conducted by the A400M. Among others, the RAF also completed a nine-hour round-trip mission with an A400M from the UK to conduct airdrop resupply in support of a UK Army training Exercise in Estonia. After the years, the RAF and the A400M continue its trustful and growing relationship.

The A400M was launched in 2003 to respond to the combined needs of seven European Nations grouped within OCCAR (Belgium, France, Germany, Luxemburg, Spain, Turkey and the UK), with Malaysia joining in 2005. This is one of the major reasons behind its extreme versatility, and the reason why already 10 countries have the new generation airlifter among their fleets.

“The A400M is becoming a key asset for our customers' military air transport activities and operations, and missions like this show that we are always on duty for them, as they are always on duty for everyone else when it matters most”, said Jean-Brice Dumont, Head of Military Air Systems at Airbus Defence and Space.

Airbus with its A400M wants to fulfil the diverse requirements of nations around the globe in terms of military and humanitarian missions for the benefit of society, as those simulated during this exercise in the UK.

LATAM flight 1325 was flying from Santiago’s Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport (SCL) in Chile, to Asuncion’s Silvio Pettirossi International Airport (ASU) in Paraguay on October 26, 2022 with 48 passengers on board.

While attempting to land at ASU, the crew initiated a go-around due to bad weather and had to divert the aircraft to Foz de Iguaçu Airport (IGU) in Brazil. After staying in IGU for about three hours, the flight departed again towards ASU in Paraguay.

It was when the aircraft, a 10-year old Airbus with registration CC-BAZ, was approaching Asuncion that it encountered severe weather. Passengers in the aircraft captured footage of the severe turbulence, which has been uploaded to social media.

Terrified passengers can be heard screaming as the aircraft shook violently, while another videoshows lightning flashes outside the aircraft window during the turbulence.

The severe weather forced the flight crew to perform an emergency landing at ASU airport. Once on ground, the damage to the aircraft’s radome and windscreen was clearly visible.

Gandhinagar, October 20, 2022 – The Airbus Defence and Space Quality Management System (QMS) for the C295 aircraft has received approval from the Directorate General of Aeronautical Quality Assurance (DGAQA), the Indian regulatory authority for aeronautical quality assurance. This is the first time a QMS of a foreign aircraft manufacturer has been approved by DGAQA.

The certificate of approval was handed over by Director General of DGAQA, Sanjay Chawla to Kajetan von Mentzingen, Head of Quality, Airbus Defence and Space at a ceremony held on the sidelines of DefExpo 2022, in Gandhinagar. This is a significant first step of a comprehensive quality assurance roadmap agreed between Airbus and DGAQA for the C295 ‘Make in India’ programme.

Speaking on the approval, Kajetan von Mentzingen said, “We have crossed a milestone for the C295 ‘Make in India’ programme. This certification demonstrates the trust and confidence that DGAQA places in Airbus quality standards. It marks the beginning of a robust and comprehensive roadmap that Airbus has put in place for the C295 ‘Make in India’ programme. It will be the foundation for successful aircraft manufacturing in India under the policy of Aatmanirbhar Bharat.”

India formalised the acquisition of 56 Airbus C295 aircraft to replace the Indian Air Force (IAF) legacy AVRO fleet, in September 2021. Under the contractual agreement, Airbus will deliver the first 16 aircraft in ‘fly-away’ condition from its final assembly line in Seville, Spain. The remaining 40 aircraft will be manufactured and assembled by Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) in India as part of an industrial partnership between the two companies. This certification is part of this programme, which involves the full development of a complete industrial ecosystem: from the production of detailed parts to assembly, test and qualification, to delivery and maintenance of the complete lifecycle of the aircraft.

“Airbus is proud to support our partners in the air medical industry with the most comprehensive line of aircraft that ensure they can perform their mission of caring for patients each day,” said Romain Trapp, president of Airbus Helicopters, Inc. and head of the North American region. “We recognize that helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) providers rely on their helicopters to save lives, and we remain dedicated to providing them with state-of-the-art options they can count on when minutes matter.”

Highlights include Atrium Health, which will enhance its MedCenter Air emergency and critical care patient transport services in the Carolinas with the addition of three new twin-engine H135 helicopters. These aircraft will join the company’s existing H135 fleet.

Global Medical Response (GMR) has opted to add two new H135 aircraft to their fleet this year, on top of their existing fleet order from 2021. The operator flies a variety of Airbus products, including the H125, H130, H135 and H145 family helicopters due to their proven reliability, and continues to grow their fleet in partnership with Airbus.

These H135 additions come on top of orders for the helicopter by Stat MedEvac and North Memorial Health, both announced at Heli-Expo earlier this year.

New orders for the five-bladed H145 helicopter were placed by air medical operators located in the Northeast and Midwest United States. For example, Boston MedFlight placed a multi-year order for six H145 helicopters this year. The operator was the first air medical provider in the U.S. to place an order for the five-bladed H145 as announced at Heli-Expo.

OSF HealthCare will add one H145 to its current fleet of four H145s serving Peoria, Bloomington, Peru, Galesburg and Rockford, Illinois. Mayo Clinic recently ordered two H145s to complement the one ordered in 2021, as well.

Another highlight is the purchase of a single-engine H125 by the Daniel R. Sayre Memorial Foundation, which will be donated to the Hawaii Fire Department to enhance their emergency medical services. This is the department’s first Airbus product and will also be used for search and rescue missions.

A leading helicopter in the single-engine HEMS market in the U.S., the H125 features the largest cabin in its class that can carry up to four people and medical equipment when configured for emergency medical transportation.

The Airbus H135, the world-wide fleet leader for HEMS missions, is recognized as an excellent tool for the air medical transport industry. The lightweight rotorcraft offers the highest safety levels in its class, contributing to its position as the worldwide fleet leader in emergency medical services. The H135 features a spacious cabin that allows providers to directly access a patient in the event of an emergency.

The H145 meets the needs of air medical operators, providing high performance, twin-engine reliability and flexibility with multiple EMS cabin interiors. The aircraft’s wide sliding doors and large rear clamshell doors facilitate safe and easy loading and unloading of patients.The five-bladed version of the helicopter, thanks to its innovative rotor system, offers customers with an increased useful load by 330 lbs, eased maintenance and a smoothened ride on-board, which benefits both crews and patients flying on-board the H145.

All of these additions build on a more than 50-year tradition of Airbus supporting HEMS operators as they work to save lives. More than half of all air medical helicopters flying in North America were produced by Airbus, and Airbus helicopters are flown by all of the continent’s major HEMS operators.

Analysis-Airbus widens A350 cabin in mile-high real estate war - Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hbmFseXNpcy1haXJidXMtd2lkZW5zLWEzNTAtY2FiaW4tMTQ0MTEzMTc1Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Tim Hepher

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus has unveiled a wider and longer cabin for its A350 in a battle for wide-body sales against Boeing - while quietly ditching the slogan on which it waged a fierce dispute over elbow space with its arch-rival a decade ago.

The two planemakers routinely go head to head over fuel efficiency. The latest salvo concerns some of the world's prime real estate - the cabin of a big jet where comfort meets cost.

Airbus said in a blog it was introducing a New Production Standard (NPS) to make A350s lighter and more flexible. Changes include scraping four inches off interior walls and making the cabin longer by moving a bulkhead and squeezing the cockpit.

""It increases comfort in all classes,"" said Anais Marzo, head of cabin interiors marketing.

Boeing declined comment, but people familiar with its pitch to airlines said it insists its comparable jet is more spacious.

Critically for resurgent wide-body jet market competition, the Airbus upgrade allows up to 34 more seats to reach more than 400 on an A350-1000, compared with the 406-seat Boeing 777X.

Extra seats affect airlines in two ways: they open up more revenue if airlines can fill them, and they reduce cost per seat - a metric that can lead to lower fares and determine which jets airlines buy.

""It is roughly 11% more efficient in economy-class pricing,"" said cabin expert and independent aviation journalist John Walton, who first reported the changes.

Currently most A350 economy cabins have nine 18-inch wide seats per row. The A350 NPS will boost that to 18.7 inches.

Airlines opting to add an extra seat per row to fly 10 abreast will have 17-inch wide seats. Industry sources say that makes it easier to sell the A350 to mainstream carriers who balk at the 16.4-inch seats offered on the current 10-abreast A350.

Only a handful of budget carriers have gone for that layout.

Even so, Airbus has been forced into a marketing U-turn.

In 2013, it campaigned for an industry standard of 18-inch wide seats for long flights and dubbed the 17-inch alternative being introduced on the rival Boeing 787 as the ""crusher"".

Story continues

It also teased Boeing with an ad campaign showing cramped seating in a restaurant and a plane under the slogan: ""You'd never accept this. So why would you accept this?""

Unveiling its new layout, however, Airbus said it ""transforms the passenger comfort (for 10 abreast) by now accommodating the full 17-inch wide industry standard economy seats.""

ELBOWS VS ECONOMICS

To be sure, many airlines have won acceptance for tighter cabins and the resulting lower fares. New sculpted seats have also given back more comfort.

But the about-face illustrates a complex poker game in large jets where planemakers often fight more than one battle, with the A350 sandwiched between the 787 and larger 777.

At the time when Airbus was campaigning for 18-inch seats, its A350 was losing sales because the 787 had nine seats per row rather than the original eight. Airbus struggled with its larger jet to compete at Boeing's seat count and went viral with its ads.

In public, the spat was about elbows. In boardrooms, it was about economics.

By calling for an 18-inch standard, Airbus was not only trying to embarrass its rival but trying to force a change in the number of seats airlines fed into their calculations and remove a disadvantage against the 787, insiders say.

Now, it has the opposite battle on its hands. It is chasing the already wider 777X, which also has scraped cabin walls. Its first plan to build a bigger A350 fell at the drawing board. Industry sources say it then came up with the cabin plan.

""Airbus is doing the inverse of what it did against the 787. It is increasing seat count and convincing airlines they should fly it that way and therefore evaluate it that way,"" one said.

Boeing is expected to show flexibility too. It argues the wider new 777X is more comfortable, returning fire against the smaller A350 just as Airbus had against the 787, sources said.

Airbus said more seats is not the only option and many airlines would use the space differently. Spain's Iberia took the first NPS at nine abreast, to be followed by Taiwan's Starlux.

But Walton predicted some 75% of A350 buyers would eventually opt for the tighter layout, matching most 777 users.

""I think you will see anyone who is only buying A350 NPS will be very strongly leaning towards 10 abreast,"" he said.

""Anyone who already has the A350 will probably go nine abreast - for now - to maintain commonality. The question is what happens later when planes start leaving the fleet.”

Spanish Airbus Unions Set To Strike

By Molly Russell, (Simple Flying)

10/31/22

Airbus employees affiliated with CCOO, UGT-FICA, and ATP-SAe will walk out indefinitely in a dispute over wages.

Worker’s Commission (CCOO), UGT-FICA, and ATP-SAe members at Airbus are set to walk out Monday in a row over wages, according to a joint union statement. The strike will impact eight Airbus sites across Spain, including the manufacturer’s third-largest facility in Getafe.

Call to strike

A concise statement published by CCOO Industry Madrid laid out the reasons for the strike call, with the unions demanding a fair salary review for Airbus’ Spanish employees following the company’s record profits to ‘guarantee the purchasing power of workers’ amid the ongoing cost of living crisis across Europe. The statement expressed a concern over economic factors negatively impacting workers’ wages and a lack of proposals and clear answers from Airbus management, with the union's adding;

“The efforts of the Airbus workers in recent years must be recognized. It cannot be that, in the current situation, the uncertainties only reflect negatively on the wages of the workers.""

On Friday, Airbus posted its Q3 results for 2022, seeing revenues up 27% to €13.309 billion ($13.236 billion) compared to the same period in 2021.

The strike will start on October 31, ending “at the moment in which the management is willing to guarantee that the workers do not lose purchasing power,” CCOO explained.

As reported by TeleMadrid, Airbus recently announced a €1,500 bonus for employees in Spain to account for the country’s current 9% inflation rate, calculated based on its local average salary base. However, the unions rejected the bonus, citing the need for a total salary review before the end of the year.

The bonus is expected to cost Airbus around €200 million, accounted for within Q3’s results, though the company has explained that its implementation will not impact negotiation processes with the unions.

Airbus currently has around 12,300 employees spread across eight sites in Madrid, Castille-La Mancha, and Andalusia, with about 3,000 working within the company’s commercial sector. It is unclear how many employees are union-affiliated and will participate in the industrial action.

Ongoing disputes

The Airbus strike call is the latest in a wave of industrial action to hit Spain’s aviation industry. Last week, workers at Ryanair’s ground handling contractor, Azul Handling, called off a range of 24-hour strikes planned between October 28 and January 8 due to minimum services demands implemented by the country’s ministry of transport. The strike action would have hit 22 airports across the country as USO fought for a new collective agreement for workers.

Vueling flight attendants associated with STAVLA are set to go on strike for around 45 non-consecutive days between November 1 and January 31. Taking place every Friday, Sunday, and Monday, STAVLA confirmed in a statement that the dispute regards slow negotiations with parent company IAG over the collective agreement and Vueling's failure to resolve the ongoing wage dispute.

IAG has claimed the demand for an additional 13.4% pay rise on top of the 6.5% agreed with CCOO over the summer is unrealistic, potentially impacting Vueling’s competitiveness within the low-cost market.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9972730278968811}",neutral,0.9972730278968811,0

The Denver-based carrier will start to take deliveries of 18 Airbus A321XLRs in 2026, a brand new jet that completed its maiden flight in June and won’t carry passengers until 2024.

Speaking at the Routes World 2022 conference in Las Vegas last week, the airline’s CEO, Barry Biffle, said that transatlantic flights were ‘definitely in consideration for the carrier and that the Airbus A321XLR ‘will enable us to fly to Europe, Hawaii, and deeper into South America.’

Although the possibility of flying transatlantic with Frontier Airlines is still a few years away, and so no routes have been confirmed, Biffle did suggest that cities like Philadelphia and Miami could benefit from the expansion.

Speaking of his visit to Airbus’ headquarters in France, Biffle noted, “I was in Toulouse three weeks ago and we were going through what the range enabled you to do from various cities in the northeastern United States. Effectively you’d be able to go from Philadelphia (PHL) to everything in the UK, Scotland, and Ireland, and, of course, you can get into mainland Europe. From Miami (MIA), you can reach just about anywhere in South America.”

Biffle also reiterated that while Frontier is planning long-haul routes in the future, the low-cost airline’s primary focus was still connecting U.S. passengers to nearby destinations, citing a recent announcement of new routes to the Caribbean.

“We’re looking to grow our near-international a lot more,” said Biffle. “We’ve invested considerably in Jamaica, Cancun, and the Caribbean. We just recently announced Denver to Montego Bay (MBJ), for example.”

Even though the exact layout of the new narrowbody Airbus for Frontier hasn’t yet been released, it is expected to be similar to what the airline currently offers. With a maximum range of 4,700 nautical miles, about 30% more than what the Airbus A321neo can reach, it will be the first passenger jet operated by Frontier that will be able to fly over the Atlantic and to the middle part of South America.

In 2019, Indigo Partners, owners of Frontier Airlines, placed an order for 50 Airbus A321XLR planes. The Memorandum of Understanding included orders for 32 A321XLRs and the conversion of 18 existing A320neo family orders.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998063445091248}",neutral,0.9998063445091248,0

But who took the lead in the market? AeroTime takes a closer look at the figures.

Airbus vs Boeing – aircraft orders

According to its latest performance summary, Airbus has received a total of 414 aircraft orders. The European manufacturer signed purchase agreements for 401 jets in July 2022 and won another 13 orders in September.

The company’s largest customers in terms of aircraft orders were mostly Chinese airlines, such as Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport (SHA)-based China Eastern Airlines (CIAH) (CEA), Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport (CAN)-based China Southern Airlines (ZNH), Chinese flag carrier Air China, and British low-cost carrier easyJet.

Airbus orders and deliveries list indicates that China Eastern Airlines (CIAH) (CEA) ordered 100 planes, including 68 Airbus A321neos and 32 A320neos, while China Southern placed an order for 96 jets, consisting of 64 A321neos, 23 A320neos, and nine A319neo narrow-body aircraft. Air China ordered 64 jets, namely 50 A321neos, nine A320neos, and five A319neos.

Meanwhile, US-based Boeing published significantly lower figures. The manufacturer managed to win a total of 256 aircraft orders – 130 were placed in July, 30 in August and 96 in September 2022.

Unlike Airbus, which has acquired a large number of orders from the Chinese market, Boeing’s largest customers were US carrier Delta Air Lines, Canada’s WestJet Airlines, Doha-based airline Qatar Airways, and Taiwan’s China Airlines.

Boeing has recorded the highest demand for its Boeing 737 MAX jets, the company’s Q3 figures indicate.

Delta Air Lines placed a substantial order for 100 jets of the type. Meanwhile, WestJet ordered 42, and Qatar Airways signed a deal for 25 737 MAXs.

Taiwan’s China Airlines ordered 16 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners.

Airbus vs Boeing – aircraft deliveries

While deliveries for both Airbus and Boeing remained sluggish in the third quarter of 2022, Airbus posted slightly higher results.

The European planemaker delivered 140 narrow-body and wide-body planes, with 46 jets received in July, 39 in August, and 55 in September.

In comparison, Boeing managed to hand over a total of 112 jets, 26 of which were transferred to customers in July, 35 in August, and 51 in September.

To date, Airbus has completed a total of 437 deliveries, while Boeing has made 328.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998421669006348}",neutral,0.9998421669006348,0
"JetBlue, Wizz Air Eye Contrasting Airbus A321XLR Strategies - Aviation Week","Wed, 19 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcnBvcnRzLW5ldHdvcmtzL2pldGJsdWUtd2l6ei1haXItZXllLWNvbnRyYXN0aW5nLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIxeGxyLXN0cmF0ZWdpZXMtMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"JetBlue Airways and European ULCC Wizz Air are two of the highest profile customers for the Airbus A321XLR, but the two carriers plan to utilize the long-range narrowbody quite differently.

The A321XLR, which completed its first flight in June and is slated to enter service in 2024, will be the longest-range single-aisle aircraft currently in production, with a range of 4,700 nm–that’s 30% farther than the baseline A321neo and 700 nm more than the A321LR variant.

JetBlue currently operates the A321LR from Boston (BOS) and New York Kennedy (JFK) to both London Gatwick (LGW) and Heathrow (LHR). The Queens, New York-based airline is eyeing deeper penetration into Europe with the XLR, of which it has 13 on order.

The carrier is putting the emphasis on a premium offering, with plans to configure its A321XLRs with 24 of its Mint-branded lie-flat seats. “We expect two-thirds of the revenue to come from one-sixth of the seats,” JetBlue’s route planning director Eric Friedman told Routes World 2022 conference in Las Vegas. “That’s how important premium is.”

The configuration is expected to be similar to JetBlue’s A321LR aircraft, which feature 138 seats, including 24 Mint seats. Passengers on JetBlue transatlantic flights are also given access to high-speed wi-fi at no extra charge.

ULCC Wizz, which has 47 A321XLR aircraft on order designated for its Wizz Air Abu Dhabi affiliate, on the other hand will configure the aircraft to the maximum capacity of 239 seats in a tight, all-economy layout. Wizz Air Abu Dhabi’s commercial manager Krislen Keri said the carrier is determined to retain its ULCC status, even as it operates long-haul 6-8-hr. routes from Abu Dhabi with the A321XLR.

“It can only be successful if we can stick to the [ULCC] model,” he said. “There will be no installation of [in-flight entertainment systems] or premium seats. Customers can bring their own cushions and their own iPads in exchange for lower fares.”

Wizz is an all-A320 family aircraft operator, all of which are configured in a single-class format.

When asked how confident Wizz is that passengers will be willing to sit in ULCC seating for 8 hr., Keri responded: “The passenger will be quite happy because their pocket will be happy. The A321XLR’s range capabilities will give more options to VFR passengers currently flying on very expensive airlines. It will fly to some very exciting destinations. For us, this is a clear win. It’s just a case of launching the routes. We want people to fly more, but pay less. If they’re flying twice a year now, they can fly 4-5 times a year for the same price.”

Highlighting the importance of VFR traffic to Wizz’s A321XLR ambitions, he added: “We’re going to have a lot more friends and a lot more relatives aboard our aircraft.”

JetBlue’s Friedman said the airline needs the aircraft, along with its A321LRs (of which it has five in service) to operate transatlantic service from Boston and New York, its two largest markets.

“From New York and Boston, there was a clear lack of ability in the past to get to some of the most relevant markets in Europe, so the choice for us always was between a widebody or the LR and XLR,” he explained, adding that widebodies do not make economic sense for JetBlue.

Friedman said JetBlue will announce another A321LR European destination in addition to LGW and LHR “very soon.”

Airbus so far has 560 orders for the A321XLR from 26 customers with “more to come,” Airbus head of market intelligence and consulting Yves Renard told the Routes World conference.

Pointing to JetBlue and Wizz, he said: “These guys are going to find routes we’ve never thought of. This is a very flexible aircraft. It can operate long and short routes.”

Broadly outlining potential routes, Renard cited transatlantic, “US to deep South America” and Australia to Japan as examples.

He added: “The A321XLR also will complement widebody aircraft by serving the same routes at off-peak times or in cases of significant seasonal variation in demand.”

Airbus currently has three A321XLRs in flight testing.

Though they will deploy disparate strategies in using the aircraft, JetBlue and Wizz agree that the A321XLR will expand route opportunities for airlines.

“We believe the XLR has the potential of being a disruptive technology in the industry,” Keri said.

“I think this will be more of a game changer than the [Boeing] 787,” Friedman said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999822378158569}",neutral,0.9999822378158569,0
Boeing's China orders dry up on US tensions in boost for Airbus - American Journal of Transportation,"Wed, 05 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFqb3QuY29tL25ld3MvYm9laW5nYXMtY2hpbmEtb3JkZXJzLWRyeS11cC1vbi11cy10ZW5zaW9ucy1pbi1ib29zdC1mb3ItYWlyYnVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By: Anurag Kotoky and Danny Lee | Oct 05 2022 at 12:00 PM | Air Cargo

China has traditionally split aircraft orders evenly between Airbus SE and Boeing Co. Recently though, there’s been a shift against the American half of the world’s planemaking duopoly.

Boeing missed out on a 40-plane deal in September, following an even bigger hit in July, when China ordered nearly 300 Airbus aircraft worth about $37 billion at sticker prices. The misses reinforce how simmering US-Sino political tensions continue to complicate the dealmaking landscape for Boeing, which is also still waiting for its 737 Max to fly again in China.

Boeing, which hasn’t signed a major plane deal with China since 2017, took the unusual step of issuing a statement after the July Airbus order was announced.

“As a top US exporter with a 50-year relationship with China’s aviation industry, it is disappointing that geopolitical differences continue to constrain US aircraft exports,” Boeing said. “We continue to urge a productive dialogue between the governments given the mutual economic benefits of a thriving aviation industry.”

The agreement with Airbus for 292 aircraft from China’s big three state-owned carriers was one of the country’s largest-ever orders. The subsequent $4.8 billion deal in September was to supply 40 jetliners to Xiamen Airlines Co., a China Southern Airlines Co. unit that previously only operated Boeing planes.

Getting Political

Boeing did seal an order for up to 24 787s from Taiwan’s China Airlines Ltd. over summer, but that could end up hampering deals with mainland carriers due to the politically-charged nature of matters relating to Taiwan, which China claims is part of its territory. The order came shortly after a contentious visit to the island by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in August. More than two dozen members of Congress have visited the self-governing democracy this year, the most since at least 2013.

Airbus was the frontrunner to win the China Airlines order until the last moment, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified because the negotiations were confidential.

“Boeing’s exclusion from the Chinese market is poised to extend amid a worsening US-China relationship, lengthening the company’s recovery timeline and crimping its outlook,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts George Ferguson and Juan Chamorro wrote in a Sept. 28 note.

“Recent visits by US politicians to Taiwan have further strained relations, which were already challenged under President Donald Trump amid a debate over competitive practices and intellectual property,” they said. “The Trump administration’s trade deal aimed to equalize some of the imbalances, but was obscured by Covid-19 and not enforced by President Joe Biden.”

A longer-term rift threatens to put Boeing well behind Airbus, with deliveries already falling to a “negligible level” since 2020, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, which warned that a lack of sales in China will curb build rates and strain the US manufacturer’s supply chain.

Max Still Grounded

Boeing still has 737 Max troubles in China, where its best-selling workhorse plane isn’t flying despite being cleared in most other major markets. China was the first to ground the Max after the model’s deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019, and while the regulator has technically allowed commercial operations to resume, Chinese airlines aren’t rushing it back into the air.

Boeing’s Top Chinese Customer Drops 737 Max From Fleet Plans

Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said last month that a small number of jets earmarked for China were being shopped elsewhere as deliveries stalled -- Chinese airlines haven’t taken any 737 Max jets since early 2019.

Aviation data provider Cirium calculated that Chinese airlines have 229 Max planes on order, including more than 100 newly-built ones waiting in Boeing factories.

Here Comes Comac

And now a Chinese aircraft manufacturer is trying to enter the fray, too. Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd.’s C919 narrowbody was formally certified at an event in Beijing attended by President Xi Jinping in late September. That should pave the way for the company, known as Comac, to start deliveries. While there’s a long way to go before the C919 will threaten Airbus and Boeing single-aisle jets, Chinese airlines will likely help the jet’s prospects.

“Local airlines will certainly support China-built aircraft and grow the aircraft market share in the homeland gradually,” Herman Tse, a senior analyst at Ascend by Cirium, said. “The political tensions and trade war between China and the US have always been a risk to Boeing’s business.”

China and Comac will, in the long run, look to supplant all Western aircraft in Chinese fleets, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

Local Operations in China

Airbus got a step ahead of its rival back in 2006, when it chose Tianjin, a municipality to the east of Beijing, as the site for a final assembly line. That has helped the company embed itself in China, producing from the facility about six narrowbody aircraft a month, which is about 10% of its total output for that type of jet. A decade later, Boeing announced plans for a completion center -- where 737 Max interiors are installed and planes are painted -- in Zhoushan, near Shanghai.

While planemakers can find delivery slots for major customers, Airbus’s jets are effectively sold out globally through 2026 and its backlog is 50% higher than Boeing’s.

“The last big deal that the Chinese have done, the Chinese airlines had, that was with us,” Boeing’s top salesman Ihssane Mounir told reporters at the Farnborough airshow in July. “Now they’ve done it with the competition, and the cycle will continue.”

As many as 1,743 Boeing jets have been delivered to China’s airlines over the years, and a strong relationship with Boeing is necessary to maintain them.

Boeing forecast in 2021 that Chinese airlines will need 8,700 new aircraft by 2040, valued at nearly $1.5 trillion. The country’s fleet size is expected to grow much faster that the world average, with almost 20% of new global demand coming from Chinese airlines, according to the company.

But China’s economy is faltering now, and the country’s draconian approach to Covid is weighing on spending.

At the Farnborough show, Mounir said the tumult in China was all part of a “long journey.”

“China will remain a very important market to us. We count on it,” he said. “Our relationship with our airline customers is very strong. We’re engaging with them.”

Conflicting fortunes for Airbus A319neo | - AirInsight,"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vYWlyaW5zaWdodC5jb20vY29uZmxpY3RpbmctZm9ydHVuZXMtZm9yLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzE5bmVvL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Care to share?

Correction – Airbus’ backlog of its least-popular neo version, the A319neo, has been further reduced. The airframer has deleted orders for two aircraft from Air Cote D’Ivoire in its September backlog. This brings the backlog to just 75 aircraft, with ten A319neo’s now delivered. Conflicting fortunes for Airbus A319neo.

The A319neo has been the victim of an industry trend: upgauging. Where its predecessor, the A319ceo, has been hugely successful with 1.486 sales, the neo version has always struggled to attract customers. Airlines preferred the bigger A320neo and even that one is too small for many airlines, who prefer the economies of the even-larger A321neo, LR, or XLR.

It shows: the A319neo attracted just 85 sales, of which eight are for the ACJ319 corporate version. The Airbus order book shows five aircraft on order from Air China, which all have to be delivered. China Southern Airlines has taken delivery of four since February this year out of thirteen on order. The biggest A319neo customer will be Spirit Airlines, with 31 on order since signing a Memorandum of Understanding in October 2019. There are also 27 aircraft in the book for undisclosed customers.

Until last month, Air Cote D’Ivoire also wanted the A319neo. The Abidjan-based airline operates a fleet of three A319ceo’s, two A320ceo’s, and a single A320neo. In April 2016, it placed an order for two A320ceo and A320neo aircraft but changed this in January 2019 to one A320neo and two A319neo’s. The A320neo was delivered in February 2021, but the smaller siblings never entered the production stage and are now no longer included.

The same faith seemed to happen to two A319neo’s for Tibet Airlines, but September has changed this. Airbus said it delivered the first of two aircraft on order on the 26th. Initially, we believed this to be MSN10607, which was spotted by the author at Airbus Hamburg in June (main picture), fully covered by protective material and without CFM engines, which could be explained by the supply chain issues at the engine maker. But the aircraft was spotted by others today in the same status. The first delivery must have been MSN11046 then, but only a contractual one as the aircraft is still in Hamburg.

With 120-150 seats, the A319neo has in-house competition from the similar sized A220-300, which makes it unlikely that the neo will attract new customers anytime soon. Except if you look for a 120-150 seater with more range: at 6.850 kilometers, the heavier neo outperforms the -300, which flies only 6.297km.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.4983852505683899}",positive,0.4983852505683899,1
How American Airlines Will Deploy Its New Airbus A321XLRs - View from the Wing,"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJWh0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS8_cD0xNzMwOTTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"American Airlines expects to begin taking delivery of new extended range narrowbody planes – the Airbus A321XLR – starting in the first quarter of 2024.

At an internal meeting, a recording of which was reviewed by View From The Wing, executives at the airline discussed how they plan to deploy the plane.

Vice President of Network Planning Brian Znotins shared that they’re still “working with Airbus on the range” of these aircraft, and so they aren’t actually sure what routes it will be able to service. However,

They will be based primarily at New York JFK and Philadelphia. This makes sense because they can fly short transatlantic operations, and these hubs offer the shortest distances across the Pond, able to reach more cities. In addition, the plane is expected to deploy on some premium cross country routes to and from New York.

This makes sense because they can fly short transatlantic operations, and these hubs offer the shortest distances across the Pond, able to reach more cities. In addition, the plane is expected to deploy on some premium cross country routes to and from New York. >They will also show up in Charlotte, Chicago O’Hare, and Miami operating thin routes to major European destinations mostly, I would imagine, though basing some at Miami could mean northern South America.

In Charlotte the A321XLR will be additive allowing for some new routes without the demand to sustain a widebody aircraft, and it will also swap with widebodies seasonally – widebodies in the summer, the narrowbody over the winter to Europe when demand drops. Charlotte is a stretch to reach some European destinations with the XLR so it won’t open as many routes as it will for its northern hub cousins.

The Airbus A321XLR will be good for Charlotte because its lower costs, and ability to fill planes with fewer passengers, means that Charlotte can support more international flying. There are only so many European destinations from Charlotte that will support a Boeing 777, and there are more that American Airlines can fly to with the smaller XLR.

Massimo Mancini, Vice President of Commercial Planning and Analysis, noted that the XLRs will be used on premium cross country flights. American hasn’t spoken to this specifically, and indeed I still wouldn’t be surprised to see some widebody aircraft used on premium cross country flights as well, as the A321T is phased out.

Over the summer I wrote to expect American to use these Airbus A321XLRs on premium cross country routes allowing them to reconfigure their existing premium A321T fleet to offer standard domestic cabins. That means no more Flagship First Class, a better business class (no longer 2 x 2), and a less premium coach product. That’s exactly what they are doing.

American is putting new business class and premium economy seats in these planes. Business class will be suites with doors, with direct aisle access, just one seat on each side of the aisle. That’s going to be a highly competitive hard product whether it’s flying internationally or on premium domestic routes.

While I love the spaciousness of a widebody aircraft, I’m really looking forward to the premium experience on these planes. And I’m looking forward to a premium experience on routes that didn’t previously support one. I’m also grateful for the expected range of the XLR, so that it can be better-used on long routes than comparable Boeing aircraft which have a narrower fuselage and therefore end up having a less desirable passenger experience.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999949932098389}",neutral,0.9999949932098389,0
Airbus' giant Beluga delivers Airbus satellite to Cape Canaveral just hours after its twin was launched – SatNews - news.satnews.com,"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL25ld3Muc2F0bmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8xNy9haXJidXMtZ2lhbnQtYmVsdWdhLWRlbGl2ZXJzLWFpcmJ1cy1zYXRlbGxpdGUtdG8tY2FwZS1jYW5hdmVyYWwtanVzdC1ob3Vycy1hZnRlci1pdHMtdHdpbi13YXMtbGF1bmNoZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus BelugaST (A300-600ST), a special outsized aircraft, touched down at the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral in Florida this weekend to deliver the Airbus-built HOTBIRD 13G satellite for Eutelsat. This happened a few hours after its twin, HOTBIRD 13F, was successfully launched by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.

Hotbird 13F [Eutelsat]

The spacecraft are the first members of the new “Eurostar Neo” family of Airbus telecommunications satellites, based on a next-generation platform and technologies developed with the support of the European Space Agency (ESA), and others, including the Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales (CNES) and the UK Space Agency (UKSA).

Largest cross-section to open new markets

The Beluga benefits all possible market applications, since it possesses the world’s largest interior cross-section of any transport aircraft, accommodating outsized cargo of up to 7.1m in width by 6.7m in height.

This milestone also marks the first time since 2009 that the Beluga has visited the USA — when it transported the International Space Station European module “Tranquility”. For this latest mission, the Beluga used 30 % Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for its departure flight from Toulouse — reflecting Airbus’ decarbonization ambitions.

“It is a true honor to consecutively showcase two satellites for our customer Eutelsat: two pieces of European technology at the iconic Kennedy Space Center,” said Jean-Marc Nasr, Head of Space Systems at Airbus. “The ability of Airbus to field an autonomous European solution is underscored by the transportation of our satellites in the unique Beluga aircraft — a true example of pan-Airbus synergies!”

Once they reach their orbital position, these two satellites, with more efficient power and thermal control systems than their predecessors, will be able to broadcast more than 1,000 television channels across Europe, Northern Africa and the Middle East. They will also enhance Eutelsat’s ability to provide connectivity for more than 135 million people, as they replace three Eutelsat satellites currently in orbit.

With the advent of the new BelugaXL, based on the larger A330-200 platform, the existing BelugaST fleet is progressively being made available for outsized freight transport services globally. Since the launch of the new Airbus Beluga Transport service in January, the BelugaST has performed missions for various customers worldwide.

First crewed Moon-mission gets closer - Airbus,"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTEwLWZpcnN0LWNyZXdlZC1tb29uLW1pc3Npb24tZ2V0cy1jbG9zZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"While Orion ESM-1 orbits the Moon to test its system during the Artemis I mission phase planned for launch in a few weeks, thesecond European Service Module (ESM-2) will undergo test campaigns on the crew module interfaces and overall system integrity for the first crewed Moon-mission planned for 2024.

We are in for an exciting time as NASA's Artemis missions take us to the Moon. It's been 50 years since humans last set foot on the Moon, and we are set to see it happening again by the middle of this decade. With the Artemis missions and the Orion spacecraft, the adventure will begin next month with the first uncrewed mission. But this is a decade-long story and exciting things have been happening on the way towards the second Artemis mission, as an assembly milestone confirms the maturity of our second European Service Module (ESM-2).

Airbus plays a very important role in the success of the Artemis missions, because the European Service Module (ESM), which Airbus is building for NASA, supplies the spacecraft with water, electricity and oxygen. The ESM also ensures propulsion and temperature regulation.

Artemis I will be used to extensively test the spacecraft's systems. For this purpose, Orion will orbit the Moon. This mission is uncrewed and the launch is expected in November 2022.

The second European Service Module for NASA's second Orion spacecraft is the first crewed mission and will carry humans around the Moon. The Artemis II launch is currently planned for 2024.



The ESM-2 was built at Airbus in Germany and has been at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida for the past year for assembly and testing with the Crew Module to make up the Orion spaceship. For this to happen, ESM-2 had to be installed with the crew module adapter (CMA) which connects the crew capsule with the service module, including all lines and cables. This part is done and the next milestone is to successfully complete the current test campaign to ensure all interfaces with the crew module are working as they should.

Lars Bauer, Lead System Engineer ESM-2, says “Building a spaceship takes time and it's not easy! That's why it's always special when everything comes together and that's what we see here with the second Orion spaceship now nearly fully assembled and in the final stages of test, to be ready to return to the Moon.”

The tests include pressure regulation and thermal cycle tests. The pressure regulation test ensures that the valves are working correctly with the flight control software of the spaceship. The thermal test takes place in a special chamber to prove that Orion is able to work when exposed to the different temperatures it will experience in space.



The last step is an acoustic test, during which various loudspeakers are aimed at the module to expose the ESM to different sound pressure levels. Sensors will register the vibrations of the structure and components to make sure it survives the large vibrations at launch. The final step for Airbus will then be the installation of the solar panels on the service module by the end of 2023.

Airbus plays a very important role in the success of the Artemis missions, because the European Service Module (ESM), which Airbus is building on behalf of ESA as part of Europe's contributions to NASA, supplies the spacecraft with water, electricity and oxygen. The ESM also ensures propulsion and temperature regulation.



As you can see, the sky is not our limit and we are ready to go to the Moon and beyond. Keep fingers crossed for Artemis I in November and stay tuned for more exciting stories about the Artemis missions, the European Service Module and the Orion spacecraft.

In fact, when the A300B was rolled out a month earlier the over 1,000 assembled guests and politicians were more interested in the Concorde which was on show for the occasion.

“When the guests were finally allowed to gather under the two planes for a closer look,” Airbus test pilot Bernard Ziegler later recalled, “everyone made a mad dash… for the Concorde.”

In the early 1970s supersonic travel was still uppermost as the future of travel, not some “big cow” as one Airbus director put it. But that big cow would start a revolution called the big twin.

At the time commercial aviation was dominated by the giant aerospace companies on the west coast of the US — Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed, which accounted for more than 95 per cent of all aircraft sold.

Through the 50s and 60s, Europe’s aviation landscape was dysfunctional with many small companies mostly producing runs below 50, while the US giants built aircraft in the hundreds and thousands. Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Italy had excellent design and engineering capabilities but unity was the issue as well as the scale of the local market.

Only the Vickers Viscount (below) the Sud Aviation Caravelle, Fokker’s F-27 and F-28 and the BAC1-11 had established themselves as truly successful programs.

First three Vickers Viscounts on the production line at Hurn in the UK. Colorized by Benoit Vienne.

For years, Europe had searched for ways to cooperate to combat the dominance of the US airline industry. By the late 1960s, the economic reality of cooperation overcame national pride. France started the Airbus program in 1966 to meet a specification from American Airlines for the twin-engine aircraft that would fly medium ranges with 250 passengers. That same year France, Germany and Britain agreed to cooperate on the Airbus project and by April 1967 funds were flowing into the project.

Airbus had a host of barriers to overcome, including import duty into the US, lack of a track record, airlines bloated with 747s, DC-10s and Tristars and the fuel crisis of 1973. The A300, however, was the right aircraft for the airlines, burning 25 per cent less fuel per passenger than the 727-200, which it was designed to replace. And as a bonus, it could haul 2.5 times more cargo than a 727. By the mid-1970s, Airbus was starting to be noticed and sales slowly built for the A300 and the smaller A310.

In the 1980s it launched the single-aisle A320, then the A330, and the four-engine A340.

A319, part of the A320 Family

Up to 1999, the company sold more than 4,000 jets across a number of designs, and it had seen off both McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed. In 2000, Airbus launched the A380 — the world’s biggest commercial passenger aircraft.

However, it is the smallest member of the Airbus family, the single-aisle 180-230-seat A320 family, that has stamped it as a powerhouse. It was first delivered to Air France in 1988 and by 1999 Airbus had built 1,142. With the explosion of the low-cost airlines from 2000 onwards, the number has skyrocketed to 10,516 delivered with 6,115 on the backlog.

Although the A380 has not seen the success Airbus had hoped for and was cancelled in 2019 with a production run of only 251, other big wide-body models such as the A330 and the A350, used by Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific Airways, have been runaway successes.

Qatar Airways A380

The A350 was selected by Qantas for its Sunrise Project this year along with an order for up 135 Airbus A320s and A220s. Qantas once a passionate all-Boeing airline will in the next decade be an almost all-Airbus airline.

Airbus now has a 63 per cent market share of the commercial market backlog with 7,294 orders and has evolved into a truly multinational company with space and defence as well as helicopter divisions and has 180 locations and 12,000 direct suppliers globally.

Not in their wildest dreams could the founding fathers of Airbus, Roger Beteille, German aerospace manufacturing genius Felix Kracht, Aerospatiale chairman Henri Ziegler and German politician Franz-Josef Strauss have imagined what heights Airbus would reach.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6517593860626221}",neutral,0.6517593860626221,0

Airbus: SAF Is 'Set for Takeoff' In U.S. Business Aviation - Aviation Week,"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9zaG93bmV3cy9uYmFhL2FpcmJ1cy1zYWYtc2V0LXRha2VvZmYtdXMtYnVzaW5lc3MtYXZpYXRpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ORLANDO—The global airline industry may be leading the charge to switch to sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), but U.S. business jet operators are also poised to significantly increase their use of SAF. That is the conclusion of new research commissioned by Airbus Corporate Jets, which finds that the use of SAF in U.S. business aviation “is set for takeoff.”

Fifty-eight of 100 senior U.S. executives surveyed say they expect the use of SAF in the private aviation sector will increase “significantly” over the next five years, with a further 32% forecasting at least a “slight increase.” All of the companies surveyed had annual revenues in excess of $500 million.

“The business aviation sector is acutely aware of the need to find ways to reduce the impact of flying on the environment,” said Sean McGeough, head of Airbus Corporate Jets (ACJ) North America.

The high price of SAF is one deterrent to its greater adaptation. But 89% of the executives surveyed believe that costs will come down in the next five years due to increased investments in technologies to process feedstocks more efficiently and at greater scale. Nearly eight in 10 respondents also believe the business aviation’s improved sustainability record, including a greater use of SAF, will lead to more U.S. corporations purchasing private jets.

The study was conducted for ACJ in September by Pureprofile, an independent research company.

All ACJ aircraft are certified to fly with a 50% blend of SAF, including the new ACJ220, which made its first flight last December (pictured). The company has set a goal of achieving 100% SAF certification by 2030.
