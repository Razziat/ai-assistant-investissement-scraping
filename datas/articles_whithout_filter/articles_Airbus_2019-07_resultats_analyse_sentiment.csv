An Airbus futuristic conceptual airliner “takes flight” to inspire next-generation engineers - Airbus,"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE5LTA3LWFuLWFpcmJ1cy1mdXR1cmlzdGljLWNvbmNlcHR1YWwtYWlybGluZXItdGFrZXMtZmxpZ2h0LXRvLWluc3BpcmUtbmV4dNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Revealed at this week’s Royal International Air Tattoo air show in the UK, the theoretical design is a hybrid-electric, turbo-propeller aircraft for regional air transportation. Inspired by efficient mechanics of a bird, it has wing and tail structures that mimic those of a bird of prey, while featuring individually controlled feathers that provide active flight control.

One of the priorities for the entire industry is how to make aviation more sustainable – making flying cleaner, greener and quieter than ever before. We know from our work on the A350 XWB passenger jet that through biomimicry, nature has some of the best lessons we can learn about design.

Biomimicry’s potential in aircraft design

While not intended to represent an actual aircraft, Airbus’ “Bird of Prey” is based on realistic ideas – providing an insight into what a future regional aircraft could look like. It includes a blended wing-to-fuselage joint that mirrors the graceful and aerodynamic arch of an eagle or falcon, representing the potential of biomimicry (the design and production of materials, structures and systems inspired by nature).

“Our ‘Bird of Prey’ is designed to be an inspiration to young people and create a ‘wow’ factor that will help them consider an exciting career in the crucially-important aerospace sector,” explained Martin Aston, a senior manager at Airbus. “One of the priorities for the entire industry is how to make aviation more sustainable – making flying cleaner, greener and quieter than ever before. We know from our work on the A350 XWB passenger jet that through biomimicry, nature has some of the best lessons we can learn about design. Who can’t help but be inspired by such a creation?”

The Bird of Prey concept was unveiled at the Royal International Air Tattoo event to underscore the UK’s aerospace industry leadership, and also highlights the 50th anniversary of Airbus as an aircraft manufacturer. The conceptual design initiative is backed by the GREAT Britain campaign, the Royal Aeronautical Society, the Air League, the Institution of Engineering and the Technology and Aerospace Technology Institute.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9054434895515442}",neutral,0.9054434895515442,0
Airbus A350 software bug forces airlines to turn planes off and on every 149 hours - The Register,"Thu, 25 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS8yMDE5LzA3LzI1L2EzNTBfcG93ZXJfY3ljbGVfc29mdHdhcmVfYnVnXzE0OV9ob3Vycy_SAVNodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vQU1QLzIwMTkvMDcvMjUvYTM1MF9wb3dlcl9jeWNsZV9zb2Z0d2FyZV9idWdfMTQ5X2hvdXJzLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Some models of Airbus A350 airliners still need to be hard rebooted after exactly 149 hours, despite warnings from the EU Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) first issued two years ago.

In a mandatory airworthiness directive (AD) reissued earlier this week, EASA urged operators to turn their A350s off and on again to prevent ""partial or total loss of some avionics systems or functions"".

The revised AD, effective from tomorrow (26 July), exempts only those new A350-941s which have had modified software pre-loaded on the production line. For all other A350-941s, operators need to completely power the airliner down before it reaches 149 hours of continuous power-on time.

Concerningly, the original 2017 AD was brought about by ""in-service events where a loss of communication occurred between some avionics systems and avionics network"" (sic). The impact of the failures ranged from ""redundancy loss"" to ""complete loss on a specific function hosted on common remote data concentrator and core processing input/output modules"".

In layman's English, this means that prior to 2017, at least some A350s flying passengers were suffering unexplained failures of potentially flight-critical digital systems.

Airbus' rival Boeing very publicly suffered from a similar time-related problem with its 787 Dreamliner: back in 2015 a memory overflow bug was discovered that caused the 787's generators to shut themselves down after 248 days of continual power-on operation. A software counter in the generators' firmware, it was found, would overflow after that precise length of time. The Register is aware that this is not the only software-related problem to have plagued the 787 during its earlier years.

It is common for airliners to be left powered on while parked at airport gates so maintainers can carry out routine systems checks between flights, especially if the aircraft is plugged into ground power.

The remedy for the A350-941 problem is straightforward according to the AD: install Airbus software updates for a permanent cure, or switch the aeroplane off and on again.

Flying down the rabbit hole

An Airbus marketing publication (PDF) from 2013 explains that the A350's Common Remote Data Concentrator (CRDC) units were designed to ""allow significant wiring simplification"", with an aerospace trade mag going into greater depth to explain that Airbus' newest airliner design features 29 CRDCs ""spread around the aircraft"" and working in concert with 21 Core Processing Input Output Module (CPIOM) modules, interfacing with various systems and sensors.

CRDCs take input data (say, the exact position of a flight control surface) and turn that into an ARINC 429-compatible digital signal for transmission over the A350's internal network to a CPIOM. That network runs over a protocol developed by Airbus called ADFX, or Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet. The CPIOM is effectively a mini computer; in the A350 CPIOMs run discrete avionics ""applications"", in the sense of apps. CRDCs themselves do not host or run applications, suggesting that the failure condition detailed in the EASA AD may mean loss of a particular app on a CPIOM after a buffer overflow.

A Delta Airlines training manual on Scribd, of all places, explains what the A350's CPIOM apps are. They include: the fuel quantity and management system, which tells pilots how much juice their bird has drunk; the cabin pressure control system; wing ice protection systems; the engine bleed air system, which among other things supplies oxygen to the passenger cabin for you to breathe; and the landing gear extension and retraction system.

Airlines acquiring the A350-941 model subject to the EASA AD include Air France, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Lufthansa, as well as Air China and Taiwan's China Airlines. Both British Airways and Virgin Atlantic are buying A350-1041s, which are a different model from the affected A350-941s.

There are no A350s (ICAO codes A359 and A35K) currently on the UK register, though registrations have been reserved for those being acquired by British airlines.

Airbus' new bird-plane hybrid is both fascinating and unsettling - The Verge,"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDE5LzcvMTkvMjA3MDA2MTQvYWlyYnVzLWJpcmQtb2YtcHJleS1wbGFuZS1oeWJyaWQtY29uY2VwdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus unveiled a new concept airplane called “Bird of Prey,” which seems fitting because this thing seems designed to prey on your deepest fears. The bird-like conceptual airline design features multiple propellors, a rudder branded with the Union Jack, and something called “feathered wings” which I can’t seem to unsee.

The body of the plane is bronze-colored and looks more fish-like than anything else. The addition to the tendril-tipped wings, though, make it clear that Airbus’ designers had birds on the brain when they came up with this one.

Airbus unveiled the concept at the Royal International Air Tattoo air show in the UK. The French aerospace giant thankfully has no plans to build or manufacture this chimeric monstrosity, which is probably for the best.

More intriguing is the propulsion system undergirding this fantastical experiment. Using technology now under development, the Bird of Prey could provide a 30-50 percent reduction in fuel burn compared to equivalent aircraft today — a major leap in efficiency.

“One of the priorities for the entire industry is how to make aviation more sustainable – making flying cleaner, greener and quieter than ever before,” Martin Aston, a senior manager at Airbus, said in a statement. “We know from our work on the A350 XWB passenger jet that through biomimicry, nature has some of the best lessons we can learn about design. Who can’t help but be inspired by such a creation?”

making flying cleaner, greener and quieter than ever before

Hey, if designing some weird bird-plane is what it takes to “inspire” the airline industry to ditch fossil fuels in favor of more clean-burning energy, I’m all for it. I’ll strap on a pair of Hawkman wings myself like I’m in a Terry Gilliam movie. But the adoption of hybrid and battery-powered propulsion systems in aviation is taking its sweet time because putting planes in the air is heavy stuff.

Flying requires an incredible amount of energy, and presently, batteries are too heavy and too expensive to achieve liftoff. Energy density — the amount of energy stored in a given system — is the key metric, and today’s batteries don’t contain enough energy to get most planes off the ground. To weigh it out: jet fuel gives us about 43 times more energy than a battery that’s just as heavy.

Airbus’ idea of biomimicry, which it defines as “the design and production of materials, structures and systems inspired by nature,” is certainly intriguing. And Airbus isn’t alone in thinking that airplane wings, traditionally thick and sturdy, could use an upgrade.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9991506338119507}",neutral,0.9991506338119507,0
Airbus and Boeing Report June 2019 Commercial Aircraft Orders and Deliveries - Defense & Security Monitor,"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vZHNtLmZvcmVjYXN0aW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC5jb20vMjAxOS8wNy8xNi9haXJidXMtYW5kLWJvZWluZy1yZXBvcnQtanVuZS0yMDE5LWNvbW1lcmNpYWwtYWlyY3JhZnQtb3JkZXJzLWFuZC1kZWxpdmVyaWVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus wins orders race at 53rd Paris Air Show, Boeing secures major 737 MAX vote of confidence

by J. Kasper Oestergaard, European Correspondent, Forecast International.

At the 53rd Paris Air Show in June, a total of 866 firm orders and commitments for commercial aircraft were announced – of which Airbus captured 363 ahead of Boeing’s 282 with the remainder going to Embraer, ATR and others. Photo Courtesy: Airbus S.A.S.

Boeing and Airbus delivered 39 and 76 commercial jets in June 2019, compared to 82 and 80 deliveries, respectively, in the same month last year. Boeing’s deliveries have taken a severe hit since the March 10 crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, a 737 MAX, and the subsequent deliveries halt and grounding of the fleet. Boeing decided on March 14 to suspend all deliveries of 737 MAX jets. The crashes were with a high degree of certainty caused by the aircraft’s Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which suddenly activated in response to erroneous angle of attack information. In 2018, Boeing delivered 806 jets (763 in 2017), with Airbus handing over 800 (718 in 2017). With 239 deliveries this year to date, Boeing is 139 shipments behind last year’s total for the first half of the year. Airbus delivered a total of 389 jets from January to June, compared to just 303 during the same period last year.

Deliveries

In June 2019, Boeing delivered seven 737s (all were 737 NGs). Boeing is still producing 737 MAX jets at a reduced rate of 42 aircraft per month, and thereby building up an inventory of aircraft ready to be shipped. During 2018, Boeing raised its 737 production rate to 52 and was planning for a further increase to 57 per month from June this year. Producing the 737 MAX at a reduced rate will allow the company to prioritize additional resources to focus on returning the 737 MAX to flight. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has established a Boeing 737 MAX Joint Authorities Technical Review (JATR) comprising a team of experts from the FAA, NASA, and international aviation authorities. The review sessions commenced on April 29, and the JATR team’s work is expected to take until the end of July; however, an exact date has not been announced. On May 16, Boeing announced that it had completed development of the updated software for the 737 MAX and that it had flown the aircraft with updated MCAS software for more than 360 hours on 207 flights. On May 23, the FAA held a full-day meeting with representatives from 33 global regulatory bodies to discuss the process for bringing the 737 MAX back into service. On June 26, Boeing announced that the FAA has identified an additional requirement that it has asked the company to address as it updates the software, and Boeing is now working to implement this. To date, Boeing has delivered 387 737 MAXs, of which 57 were delivered in Q1 2019. A total of 256 737 MAX jets were delivered in 2018, up from 74 in 2017. In June 2019, Boeing also delivered one 747-8, four 767s, six 777s, and an impressive 19 787s, which is a new all-time record high for that model in a single month. Boeing recently raised the monthly Dreamliner production rate to 14 aircraft. Boeing delivered 145 787s in 2018, up from 136 in 2017.

In June 2019, Airbus delivered six A220s, 54 A320s (10 CEO / 44 NEO), five A330s, 10 A350s, and one A380. A total of 386 A320neo family aircraft were delivered in 2018, up from 181 and 68 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Later this year, Airbus expects to increase the A320 production rate to 60 aircraft per month. The company is targeting a raise to 63 jets per month from 2021. Airbus delivered 93 A350s in 2018, up from 78 in 2017, and recently increased the monthly production rate to 10. Airbus is considering a further increase up to 13 A350s per month, but no date has yet been announced. With the ramp-up of A350 XWB deliveries combined with a higher A320 production rate, Airbus has nearly eliminated Boeing’s deliveries lead in recent years. Following the tragic 737 MAX events, in 2019 Airbus is almost certain to deliver more aircraft than Boeing.

Orders

Turning to the orders race, Boeing had another quiet month in June. Boeing logged nine gross orders excluding three 737 MAX cancellations, resulting in six net new orders. Boeing’s June bookings included six 767-300 freighters for FedEx, two 777 freighters for DHL, and a single 787-9 Dreamliner for Air Lease Corporation. Year to date, Boeing has accumulated 108 gross orders (227 cancellations => -119 net new orders). For full-year 2018, Boeing booked 893 net new orders (1,008 gross orders).

In the orders race Airbus had a very strong month and booked 145 gross orders, while no cancellations were reported. All Airbus’ June orders were for narrowbody A220/A320s. The largest orders were for a mix of 36 A320/A321neos for an undisclosed customer and 30 A320neos for Jeddah-based Saudia, or Saudi Arabian Airlines, the national carrier of Saudi Arabia, followed by 20 A321neos for American Airlines and 18 A320neos for Japan’s ANA. For 2019 to date, Airbus reports 213 gross orders (125 cancellations => net of 88). Of the cancellations, 31 were due to Emirates’ decision to reduce its A380 order book. This decision subsequently forced Airbus to announce that it will cease A380 production in 2021. In 2018, Airbus landed a total of 747 net new orders (831 gross orders), thereby losing the 2018 orders race, as Boeing had accumulated 893 net new orders. Airbus had retained an orders lead over its rival every year since 2012.

On June 30, 2019, Airbus’ backlog was 7,276 jets (of which 6,344, or 87%, are A220 and A320ceo/neo family narrowbodies), not far below the company’s all-time backlog record high of 7,577 jets set in December 2018. By the end of June 2019, Boeing’s backlog (total unfilled orders after ASC 606 adjustments) was 5,733 aircraft (of which 4,601, or 80%, are 737 NG/MAX narrowbody jets). Boeing’s all-time backlog high of 5,964 aircraft was set in August 2018. The number of Airbus aircraft to be built and delivered represents 9.1 years of shipments at the 2018 production level. In comparison, Boeing’s backlog would “only” last 7.1 years. This year to date, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio, calculated as orders divided by deliveries, is negative. Airbus’ book-to-bill ratio is 0.23. In 2018, Boeing boasted a book-to-bill ratio of 1.11, with Airbus at 0.93. In 2017, Boeing booked 912 net new orders, for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.20. That same year, Airbus booked 1,109 net new orders, for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.54.

Special Coverage: Paris Air Show 2019

At the 53rd Paris Air Show held at Le Bourget, June 17-23, Airbus and Boeing reported a combined 645 firm orders and commitments (MoUs, LOIs, options, etc.) for commercial aircraft – of which Airbus captured 363, ahead of Boeing’s 282. Including ATR, Embraer, and other manufacturers, the grand total was approximately 900 orders and commitments. This compares to 1,464 orders and commitments signed at Farnborough last year and 1,226 at the Paris Air Show in 2016.

Airbus won the orders race in Paris with 363 orders and commitments (149 firm orders and 214 commitments). In addition, airlines and lessors converted 352 existing aircraft orders – mostly A320neos converted to the larger A321neo variant or A321neos converted to the new A321XLR, an “Xtra Long Range” variant of the A321neo. The launch of the A321XLR was announced on the opening day in Paris and boasts a range of 4,700 nautical miles (5,400 miles), or 15 percent more than the A321LR. Malaysia’s AirAsia Group converted 253 existing A320neo orders to larger A321neos and is now the world’s largest customer for this type. Los Angeles-based aircraft leasing company Air Lease Corporation (ALC) signed a letter of intent (LOI) for 100 aircraft, including 50 A220-300s and 27 A321XLRs, plus an incremental order for 23 A321neos.

In other air show activity, American Airlines will acquire 20 firm Airbus A321XLR aircraft and convert 30 A321neos already on order to A321XLRs. Also, Indigo Partners committed to buying 32 A321XLRs and converting 18 existing A320neo family orders to A321XLRs (20 will be allocated to Wizz Air, 18 to Frontier, and 12 to JetSmart). JetBlue Airways converted 13 existing A321neo orders to A321XLRs and firmed up an order for 10 A220-300 aircraft from existing options. Nordic Aviation Capital (NAC), the industry’s largest regional aircraft lessor, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for 20 A220 jets, while International Airlines Group (IAG) ordered 14 Airbus A321XLRs (eight for Iberia and six for Aer Lingus, plus 14 options). Cebu Pacific, a low-cost carrier based in the Philippines, signed an MoU for 16 A330-900s, 10 A321XLRs, and five A320neos. Also, Qantas converted 26 A320neo orders to A321XLRs and added a new firm order for 10 A321XLR aircraft, while China Airlines signed an MoU for 11 A321neos. Flynas, a Saudi Arabian low-cost carrier, signed an MoU for 10 A321XLR jets and upgraded 10 A320neos it has on order to the A321neo. Furthermore, Virgin Atlantic ordered eight firm A330-900s, Delta Air Lines placed an order for five firm A220-100s, and Lebanon’s national carrier, Middle East Airlines (MEA), signed a firm order for four A321XLRs. Finally, Dublin-based leasing company Accipiter Holdings ordered 20 A320neo jets (already booked by Airbus in March 2019), Saudia ordered 15 A320neos – all the new A321XLR version (plus 35 A320 family options), and Atlantic Airways, the Faroe Islands flag carrier, ordered two aircraft.

Boeing also secured a solid order haul in Paris, signing a total of 282 orders and commitments, of which 20 were firm orders. IAG and Boeing surprised many by signing an LOI for 200 737 MAX aircraft, which is a major vote of confidence in the aircraft that could not have come at a better time. IAG is the parent company of Aer Lingus, British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and LEVEL. While IAG used to operate 737 Classics, its narrowbody fleet today is almost exclusively Airbus A320 family aircraft. IAG plans to acquire a mix of 737 MAX 8 and 10 jets for delivery between 2023 and 2027 and powered by CFM LEAP engines. Boeing also announced two deals for the 737-800 Boeing Converted Freighter (BCF), including 20 firm orders and 25 commitments. These orders were placed by ASL Aviation Holdings DAC (10 firm / 10 options) and GE Capital Aviation Services (10 firm / 15 options). Boeing also received 20 commitments from Korean Air for 787-9/10 Dreamliner variants, five commitments for the 787-9 from ALC, and 11 commitments for the 777F from China Airlines (six) and Qatar Airways (five). Finally, Turkmenistan Airlines announced its intent to purchase a single 777-200LR.

2019 Forecast

Forecast International’s Platinum Forecast System® is a breakthrough in forecasting technology. Among many other features, Platinum provides 15-year production forecasts. The author has used the Platinum Forecast System to retrieve the latest delivery forecasts and, for 2019, Forecast International’s analysts expect Airbus to deliver 724 large commercial jets. The 2019 forecast for Boeing was 904 prior to the second 737 MAX crash and the subsequent grounding of the fleet and temporary cut in the production rate. These are the latest “live” forecast figures (adjusted frequently by FI analysts as new information comes in). These figures exclude militarized variants of commercial platforms such as Boeing’s P-8 Poseidon, KC-46 and KC-767 tankers, the C-40, and Airbus’ A330 MRTT tanker.

Prior to the second 737 MAX crash, in connection with the release of its 2018 earnings report in late January, Boeing announced it was targeting between 895 and 905 commercial jet deliveries in 2019, a 12-13 percent increase from 2018. Boeing has yet to announce a revised figure and is likely awaiting the 737 MAX’s return to service before providing updated guidance. On February 14, Airbus announced that it aims for 880 to 890 commercial aircraft deliveries in 2019, equal to a 10-11 percent increase from 2018.

Note: Boeing 777-300ER category includes one 777-200LR order placed in October 2018.

Bjorn’s Corner: Airbus’ A321neo has a pitch-up issue (now with a second update) - Leeham News and Analysis,"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxOS8wNy8xOS9iam9ybnMtY29ybmVyLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIxbmVvLWhhcy1waXRjaC11cC1pc3N1ZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"July 19, 2019, ©. Leeham News: The European Aviation Safety Agency EASA has issued an Air Worthiness Directive (AD) to instruct operators of the Airbus A321neo of a Pitch instability issue.

EASA writes “excessive pitch attitude can occur in certain conditions and during specific manoeuvres. This condition, if not corrected, could result in reduced control of the aeroplane.”

We analyze how this is similar or different to the Boeing 737 MAX pitch instability issues.

NOTE 2: We have got a further update from Airbus, see below.

A321neo pitch instability

The AD makes clear the issue is connected to a software version of the A321neo Elevator Aileron Computers (ELACs), the Fly-By-Wire computers used for the A320 series control of pitch and roll.

As the AD does not apply to the in-service A320neo, the issue is not connected to the pitch instability which comes as a natural consequence of mounting the larger neo engines on the A320 series. It’s restricted to how the present A321neo version of the ELACs handles the aircraft’s controls in an excessive pitch up condition in an isolated flight mode, the Flare mode when landing.

Note 2: Since writing the article and our first note Airbus has provided us further information, given verbatim here:

The origin of the “excessive pitch” is associated to a reduction in efficiency of the angle of attack protection in a very remote combination of conditions, these being: The need for the crew to perform a dynamic manoeuver (such as a go around) AND the aircraft being below 100ft AND specific landing configuration AND a very aft CG.

The A321NEO flight controls commands were modified, in response to customer requests, for certain flight phases to improve the dynamism of the aircraft. The changes introduced, are not linked to the size, location or weight associated to the installation of the engines.

It is these changes, which, together with some existing control characteristics (again not related to the size, location or weight of the engines) mean that in the very remote combination of conditions, described above, they could lead to the reduction in efficiency of the angle of attack protection, and could lead to “excessive pitch”.

This was identified during extensive computer based simulator testing. It was not identified neither during flight tests nor in response to in-service reports nor as part of studies being performed in relationship to any other events related to other aircraft types which are currently being widely discussed

Our comment to the new information: The Airbus information explains why the issue is limited to the A321neo. There were changes made to its FBW in the present release of the software to make the aircraft react livelier to commands in approach configuration Full flaps and when in FBW Flare mode. These changes can in a very remote case render the stall protection (Airbus FBW protects you from entering a stall) less effective. It wasn’t detected in test flights of the A321neo as it requires the Pilot to command a very strong pitch up when in Flare mode and keep this command when entering the pre-stall and stall region of the aircraft. If you pitch up an Airbus violently and don’t stop the pitch before coming close to stall, you’d expect the aircraft to always hinder you from entering the stall. In this remote case with a very strong-handed pilot and an aft CG, Airbus found this can be less effective. The AD is about avoiding this remote case, to guarantee the expected stall protection is at all times effective. The restriction is to avoid the most aft CG positions for the aircraft until the next release of the FBW software is available 3Q2020.

Pitch instability from larger engines

This part of the article is a general discussion about the physics involved in the pitch stability of aircraft. Read my series about this here for more background, it continues for nine more weeks on the Fridays. With the above explanation from Airbus, it’s not connected to the issued AD. The larger engines for the A320neo series are controlled by the aircraft’s inherent pitch stability which is constituted by the aircraft’s horizontal Stabilator and Elevator and its FBW which controls these aerodynamic surfaces.

Like the 737 MAX, the A319/320/321neos are affected by the mounting of larger engines with their larger nacelles ahead of the center of gravity, Figure 1. It follows the aerodynamic rule: any surface projecting an aerodynamic horizontal surface ahead of the Center of Gravity (CG) contributes to a Pitch-up moment and any surface projecting an aerodynamic horizontal surface behind the CG contributes to a Pitch-down moment. This is why aircraft have horizontal stabilizers behind the CG to balance the aircraft in pitch. The elevator can then control a balanced aircraft in pitch.

Figure 1. A321 shown on top of A321neo. The larger engine nacelles are marked with a violet color. Source: Airbus and Leeham Co.

As for the MAX, the larger nacelles for the A321neo are placed further up relative to the wing (Figure 2) but no further forward. The nacelles are larger than the 737 nacelles, however, so the pitch up moment from the engines in isolation can be similar. As the engines sit lower on the wing their combined effect with the rest of the aircraft and its wing is not the same as the 737 MAX. According to Airbus, it has not been forced to do anything special to control the changed pitch balance of the A321neo.

The AD and the explanation from Airbus singles out recently changed flight laws in the ELACs for the A321neo to be the root cause for the pitch-up described in the AD. It allows the Pilot to command fast dynamic pitch ups when in Flare mode (which is just before landing) and at a very aft CG. If the pilot keeps commanding the fast pitch-up into the stall region it can overwhelm the present anti-stall algorithm. The FBW software needs a change so this condition does not occur and the Airbus anti-stall function works as described in the Flight Manual. Until this change is fielded 3Q202o there are restrictions to the aircraft’s aft CG limit to avoid the described condition to appear.

The takeaways

There are several takeaways from the above (changed since the original article):

As we have written in several articles, pitch stabilities comes down to how several parts of an airliner work together.

Reduced pitch stability at certain regions of the Angle of Attack envelope when testing the aircraft in wind tunnel with fixed tailplane surfaces is present for many aircraft types.

Different aircraft implement different means to make the aircraft stable in pitch. It can be made with aerodynamic surfaces like the ventral strakes seen on the underside of the tail of the Learjet or with control of the stabilator and its elevator in the region of changed stability. It the latter case it’s important how the control is made to produce a safe aircraft.

In the case of the MAX, software-based control logic is used, controlling the movements of the horizontal stabilizer and elevator. It’s key how these controls are designed, tested and implemented.

The original MAX implementation was inacceptably badly done. It relied on a single sensor, commanded unnecessary repeated nose-down trim commands and didn’t have any global limitation on its authority.

The updated MAX software has an improved trigger where both Angle of Attack sensors values are compared (and it deactivates the function if these disagree), it only commands one nose-down trim sequence and it has a global limitation guaranteeing the Pilot can always take the aircraft out of a dive. In my judgment, this makes the 737 MAX safe to fly with MCAS. I’m on the record with this judgment, and I will not hesitate to fly on the updated MAX.

It also incentives me to continue my Stability and Control Corners where I will dwell deeper on the differences between a conventionally controlled aircraft and an FBW aircraft.

"Air France-KLM orders 60 new Airbus planes, plans A380 phase-out - Tech Xplore","Tue, 30 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHhwbG9yZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDE5LTA3LWFpci1mcmFuY2Uta2xtLWFpcmJ1cy1wbGFuZXMtYTM4MC5odG1s0gFJaHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoeHBsb3JlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMTktMDctYWlyLWZyYW5jZS1rbG0tYWlyYnVzLXBsYW5lcy1hMzgwLmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus's new A220-300 is a medium-haul jet designed to carry 100 to 150 passengers

Air France-KLM said Tuesday that it would buy 60 of Airbus's new A220-300 planes, one of its biggest orders in years as the airline moves to modernise its fleet in order to reduce operating costs and rein in carbon emissions.

The company also revealed that it would cease operating its massive Airbus A380 superjumbos, saying they were no longer cost-effective in the highly competitive travel markets.

Chief Executive Ben Smith, a Canadian named last year with the task of streamlining the airline's operations, said the A220s would be cheaper to fly while also ""significantly reducing CO2 and noise emissions"".

The airline did not reveal the value of the huge order, which would be worth $5.5 billion (4.9 billion euros) at list prices, though airlines usually negotiate significant discounts.

It includes an option for 30 additional A220s, which will replace the ageing Airbus A318s and A319s for its short and medium-haul flights.

The airline said they would reduce operating costs per seat by at least 10 percent.

""This is a very important next step in Air France's transformation,"" Smith said in a statement, released ahead of the airline's first-half earnings report on Wednesday.

The A220 was known as the Bombardier C Series before Airbus bought a majority share in the loss-making aircraft last year and rebranded it.

Assembled in the Canadian province of Quebec, it can carry between 100 and 150 passengers and has a range of more than 6,000 kilometres (3,730 miles).

No more superjumbos

Air France-KLM also announced plans to phase out by 2022 the use of its 10 A380 superjumbos, which have failed to prove as popular as hoped with airlines worldwide.

Airbus had already halted production of the double-decker jet earlier this year after failing to secure any new orders

""The A380 consumes 20 to 25 percent more fuel per seat than new generation long-haul aircraft, and therefore emits more CO2,"" the airline said.

It said it is studying potential replacements for the A380s, and has already recently placed orders for Airbus's popular A350 long-haul jet as well as Boeing 787 Dreamliners.

Smith is on a drive to cut the carrier's costs and help it compete against low-cost rivals by closing or reducing shorter loss-making routes and using smaller aircraft.

In May, he also announced plans to cut up to 465 jobs through voluntary redundancies.

Airbus's New Concept Passenger Plane Is for the Birds - Popular Mechanics,"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHVsYXJtZWNoYW5pY3MuY29tL2ZsaWdodC9haXJsaW5lcy9hMjg0NTEyNjAvYWlyYnVzLWNvbmNlcHQtcGxhbmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Would you fly in this plane? It's the latest creation of Airbus, which calls it the ""Bird of Prey.""

The European multinational aerospace giant, one of the largest aerospace and defense companies in the world, says it developed the concept plane with the goal ""motivating the next generation of aeronautical engineers, underscoring how they can make a difference by applying technologies researched at the company in hybrid-electric propulsion, active control systems and advanced composite structures.""

The hypothetical plane's design was first showcased at the Royal International Air Tattoo, held on a RAF airfield in Gloucestershire, England. A hybrid-electric, turbo-propeller craft, Airbus imagines the plane being used for regional transportation.

There's a mix of new and very, very old in the Bird of Prey design. There's the hybrid-electric engine, which would be consistent with the company's stated goal of cutting aerospace industry emissions by 50 percent by 2050. There's also the oldest tool that anyone who has thought of flying has ever used: copying birds.

Going as far back as Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century, people have seen birds as inspirations for mechanical flight. But Airbus has specifically predator birds in mind, even for regional flights from Cologne to Berlin, predators.

The unique tail and wing features, Airbus says in a press statement, ""would mimic those of a bird of prey,"" like an osprey or a California condor. The tail and wings, split into prongs, would have ""feathers"" that could be individually controlled, allowing for an active flight control.

Beyond the tail and wings, the plane also features a ""blended wing-to-fuselage joint that mirrors the graceful and aerodynamic arch of an eagle or falcon,"" according to the company's press release.

“Our ‘Bird of Prey’ is designed to be an inspiration to young people and create a ‘wow’ factor that will help them consider an exciting career in the crucially-important aerospace sector,” says Martin Aston, a senior manager at Airbus, in the press statement. The Bird of Prey is not coming to an airstrip near you, it's just a thought project.

“One of the priorities for the entire industry is how to make aviation more sustainable – making flying cleaner, greener and quieter than ever before. We know from our work on the A350 XWB passenger jet that through biomimicry, nature has some of the best lessons we can learn about design. Who can’t help but be inspired by such a creation?”

Hybrid-electric planes, which would require some but less fuel than current aircraft, are gaining momentum. In 2017 Boeing, the only aerospace company larger than Airbus, began backing a startup hybrid-electric startup named Zunum Aero though the company has hit serious financial difficulties since.

Supports deployment of OneWeb network to bring transformative internet connectivity to everyone, everywhere

Facility provides ability to produce high quality satellites at speed, cost, standard, that wasn’t possible before

Opening comes just months after launch of first satellites, now operational in space

EXPLORATION PARK, Florida, USA, 22 July, 2019 – OneWeb Satellites – a joint venture of OneWeb and Airbus – today officially opened the world’s first high-volume, high-speed advanced satellite production facility to bring transformative internet connectivity to everyone, everywhere.

Historically, satellites are custom built, costing tens of millions of dollars to build, and taking more than a year to produce a single one. The OneWeb Satellites facility is the first to employ industrial-scale mass production techniques for satellites, enabling dramatically reduced costs and production times that can deliver one satellite per production shift or two a day, while significantly expanding internet connectivity and making space technology far more accessible.

“OneWeb Satellites and its partners are transforming the satellite and space industry. By producing high quality satellites at a fraction of the cost and schedule of traditional manufacturers, we are not only enabling OneWeb to connect the planet, we are making space dramatically more accessible to everyone,” said Tony Gingiss, CEO of OneWeb Satellites.

The facility’s production capabilities will first support the rapid scaling of the OneWeb network, starting with a constellation of 650 satellites and scaling to 1,980 satellites delivering global connectivity.

With half the world’s population unconnected and inconsistent connectivity persisting as people travel more at sea and in the skies, the high-performance communication satellites built in this facility will enable high-speed internet access that can unlock healthcare, education, and economic advancements.

“This is a defining moment in the history of OneWeb, and the space industry. With today’s opening, we are one step closer to connecting the unconnected for the benefit of societies all over the world,” said Adrian Steckel, CEO of OneWeb. “As we gear up for more satellite launches at the end of the year, this facility will ensure we can begin delivering global connectivity in some areas as early as next year and globally in 2021.”

The 105,500 square foot production facility, which has two production lines capable of producing two satellites a day, is helping to revitalize Florida’s Space Coast with 250 new high-tech jobs and 3,000 indirect jobs through the supply chain.

Government officials including U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, U.S. Senator Rick Scott, U.S. Rep. Bill Posey, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, Assistant Secretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs Manisha Singh, and business and community leaders in Merritt Island, Florida near the Kennedy Space Center attended the official opening with the team.

For Airbus, this new facility is the latest step in the company’s continued and long-standing growth in U.S. manufacturing, job creation and investment. Airbus utilizes 450 U.S. suppliers in 40+ states and has spent more than $187 billion in the U.S. since 1990. Airbus spending in the U.S. supports more than 275,000 American jobs.

“Airbus is manufacturing products in the U.S. from all of our business divisions – commercial aircraft, helicopters and now satellites,” said C. Jeffrey Knittel, Chairman and CEO of Airbus Americas. “We take seriously our partnerships in the communities where we do business, and we’re proud to contribute our aerospace manufacturing expertise to the Space Coast with 250 new high-tech jobs in Florida. We are equally excited to welcome these new employees to the Airbus OneWeb Satellites team in the U.S.”

OneWeb Satellites’ game-changing manufacturing technology and facility also represent a tremendous opportunity for other commercial and government customers, providing end-users with dramatic cost savings and opening the door to missions that were previously unthinkable.

“The avenue for unlocking untapped human potential lies, yet to be paved, in space,” said Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. “Private industry is a key partner in this effort as we are well on our way to a $1 trillion space economy and fueling a new revolution in technology in orbit.”

Chairman Pai added: “Since my first day as Chairman of the FCC, my number one priority has been closing the digital divide and bringing the benefits of the digital age to all Americans. Promoting innovative technologies will be critical to accomplishing that priority. Satellite constellations have the ability to deliver broadband services using a new generation of low-Earth orbit satellite technologies. That’s why the FCC under my leadership approved OneWeb’s proposal and why I was pleased to attend the opening of OneWeb Satellite’s production facility. At the FCC, we’ll continue our work to make access to high-speed Internet available across the country.”

IoT: Aerospace's great new connector - Airbus,"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE5LTA3LWlvdC1hZXJvc3BhY2VzLWdyZWF0LW5ldy1jb25uZWN0b3LSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In the aerospace industry, the Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionising operations on the ground and in the air. Real-time analytics via IoT are already driving improvements in quality and productivity—while passengers can look forward to a variety of exciting new in-flight experiences.

In 1999, MIT technology pioneer Kevin Ashton harboured an all-consuming preoccupation: how to optimise supply chain operations via a network of smart devices using radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags. And his quest to do so ultimately paid off. Alongside his colleagues at the Auto-ID Centre at MIT, he created a global standard system for RFID and other sensors. But one key question remained unanswered: what to call this exciting new field? Eventually, he settled on the term “Internet of Things.”

In the two decades since, the concept of IoT—which now encompasses a global ecosystem of sensors, embedded computers and smart devices that communicate with each other and share data—has exploded. Today, approximately 14.2 billion connected devices are currently in use around the world. By 2021, that figure is expected to jump to more than 25 billion due to a combination of cloud computing power, decreasing hardware cost and faster 5G data transfer that will accelerate growth. These devices include smart home appliances and wearable trackers, as well as a large variety of industrial innovations to improve manufacturing and operational efficiency.

In the business world, IoT is already having a major impact, from changing the methods of business operations to transforming the way information is collected and exchanged. And every sector is impacted—including aerospace.

Industrial IoT to boost aerospace manufacturing efficiency

In the aerospace industry, manufacturing efficiency is enjoying a big boost thanks to industrial IoT. This is because advanced analytics offers insight in post-flight time, enabling manufacturers to rapidly take action to correct inefficiencies.

For example, IoT enabled smart meters can offer information on energy usage in aircraft production, which could lead to significant cost savings and sustainable operations. Because advanced analytics algorithms analyse the usage and propose energy-saving measures, energy consumption could be reduced by 20%.

IoT can also give instant insight into how an entire shop floor is operating. In Airbus’ Saint Eloi factory, data from machines and conveyors is fed into a live visual representation to create a “digital shadow” of the entire assembly line. This enables users to track operations in real time, as well as carry out highly accurate simulations to find the most effective ways of enhancing operations.

At the same time, quality rates and productivity can also be improved. For example, IoT can help to monitor and control the amount of torque provided by a tool on the assembly line. If too much or not enough torque is applied, the tool stops and the user is notified immediately. At Airbus, this approach has improved efficiency by 20-30%.

By harnessing big data through IoT technology in the cabin, the on-board experience will reach the next level. And that next level is a lot more personalised.

Future passenger experience – Paris Air Show 2019 – Day 2 show more show less Ingo Wuggetzer, Vice President Cabin Marketing at Airbus, highlights technologies and services that will redefine the passenger experience aloft while touring the A330neo on static display.

IoT in the cabin: a connected experience

IoT is also making its way into the cabin—enabling airlines and passengers to look forward to a variety of exciting new travel experiences. This includes a more personalised environment, which is enhanced with new applications that enable improved interactions with the passengers’ immediate surroundings, including customised entertainment and dining options.

To create this new cabin experience, Airbus has launched its Connected Experience solution. Developed with a variety of leading partners, this open ecosystem will provide real-time links between core cabin components like the galley, lavatory, meal trolleys, seats and overhead bins. Cabin crews will have access to digital services. Consolidated, real-time data during flight—which is analysed on Airbus’ Skywise platform—will enhance predictive maintenance, cabin operations and reliability. Connected seating will provide crew with instant access to valuable information—is the seatbelt fastened, the armrest down and backrest upright? And post-flight analysis will provide airlines with valuable insight into passenger behaviour so they can continue to improve the service in the future.

As IoT increasingly becomes the standard throughout the aircraft, innovation across many areas will be essential. For Airbus, dozens of projects are expected to contribute to a wider cabin concept that aims to improve cabin flexibility and services.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9973998069763184}",positive,0.9973998069763184,1

Airbus to develop CO3D Earth Observation programme for CNES - Airbus,"Mon, 08 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wNy1haXJidXMtdG8tZGV2ZWxvcC1jbzNkLWVhcnRoLW9ic2VydmF0aW9uLXByb2dyYW1tZS1mb3ItY25lc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The next generation in optical satellite constellations

Production of 3D high-resolution data for global digital elevation model

Strategic move to support export contracts for French industry

@AirbusSpace @Cnes #DigitalSurfaceModel

Paris, France, 08 July 2019 – The French Space Agency (CNES) has awarded the CO3D (Constellation Optique 3D) contract to Airbus. Under this agreement, Airbus will deliver a global high-resolution Digital Surface Model (DSM).

Following launch, expected end of 2022, the Airbus-made CO3D constellation, comprising four identical satellites, will deliver 50cm resolution stereo imagery across the world on a daily basis. The data acquired will feed a cloud-based processing chain operated by Airbus and integrating CNES’ algorithms, to produce a cutting-edge 3D map of the Earth’s landmass.

Designed to weigh approximately 300kg, the CO3D satellites will join Airbus’ fleet of optical and radar satellites, strengthening the company’s ability to meet the growing needs of very demanding applications. Inaugurating a generation of highly innovative and all electric platforms, these extremely agile satellites will instigate a new way of acquiring, processing and transferring images to the ground. Together with the four Pléiades Neo satellites, the CO3D constellation will offer unrivalled refresh rates for very high-resolution imagery.

“CO3D is a significant leap forward for global Earth observation, taking advantage of the latest Airbus innovations which will revolutionise access to very high-resolution 3D data” said Jean-Marc Nasr, Head of Space Systems at Airbus. “This contract confirms Airbus as the trusted partner for CNES and the French Authorities, and reinforces our leading market position in Europe and the world.”

CNES and Airbus have established a virtuous partnership with this project. An integrated and agile governance between both partners will enable the mission to be optimised to cover both private and public needs. Data collected by the CO3D constellation wil be available for scientific and defence institutional partners of the programme.

During the signature event, Jean-Yves Le Gall, President of CNES, declared: “The new generation optical satellite constellation CO3D embodies French ambition and ingenuity and opens a new era for Earth observation. It will allow a higher refresh rate, improved performance and better resilience. This partnership between CNES and Airbus perfectly illustrates French excellence in Earth observation from space.”

"Airbus to build four imaging satellites for French space agency, mulls 20-plus constellation - SpaceNews","Fri, 12 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXJidXMtdG8tYnVpbGQtZm91ci1pbWFnaW5nLXNhdGVsbGl0ZXMtZm9yLWZyZW5jaC1zcGFjZS1hZ2VuY3ktbXVsbHMtMjAtcGx1cy1jb25zdGVsbGF0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Airbus and the French Space Agency CNES have agreed to cofinance a constellation of four Earth observation satellites while leaving the door open for Airbus to finance additional satellites with other partners.

The four satellites, referred to as the CO3D system, are expected to launch in 2022 aboard a Vega C rocket, with each satellite capable of imaging the Earth at a resolution of 50 centimeters.

In an interview, Philippe Pham, Airbus Space Systems’ head of Earth observation, navigation and science, said CNES is investing just under 100 million euros ($112 million) into the four satellites. Airbus is supplying “a bit more than the equivalent,” he said.

Pham said Airbus views the contract as a steppingstone to a larger constellation of “20-plus” satellites.

“We designed it as a constellation with capacity building to a ‘mini-constellation’ using the same design,” he said.

The CO3D satellites will each have a mass of 300 kilograms, and will use all-electric propulsion. The constellation is dual purpose: providing imagery to the French government, including scientific and military users, and imaging capacity for Airbus to commercialize.

Pham said Airbus’ desire to quickly expand on the initial four-satellite constellation stems from demand for faster revisit rates to image areas of customer interest. More CO3D satellites can put Airbus on the same footing as Maxar Technologies’ DigitalGlobe division and its future WorldView Legion constellation.

Maxar Technologies is targeting a revisit rate of 40 times a day for select parts of the world with WorldView Legion, a constellation of small imaging satellites whose first launch is in late 2020 or early 2021. Maxar Technologies hasn’t said how many satellites will comprise WorldView Legion, though a December FCC filing suggests it could be as many as 12.

Pham said Airbus can be “in the very same range as Maxar” with its current satellites: the 1.5-meter resolution Spot-6 and Spot-7, the 50-centimter resolution Pleiades-1A and -1B , the four 30-centimeter resolution Pleiades Neo satellites it is building now, plus a number of CO3D satellites. He did not quantify that number.

Airbus is looking for customers and partners to jointly invest in future CO3D satellites, he said. What form those investments take can vary.

“It is a mix of Airbus investment plus customers wanting to buy in. It could be a satellite, launch system, etcetera, but also access to services,” he said. “It’s a more case-by-case discussion with customers, with partners, to have some specific partnership or contracting conditions to further extend the constellation and the capacities in orbit, and to deliver data.”

The timing of the constellation expansion is linked to future co-investors, he said.

Pham said it is too early to determine if the July 10 failure of a Vega rocket will delay the first CO3D launch, which uses the next-generation Vega C. As of May, Vega C’s maiden flight was scheduled for March 2019 with a science satellite for the Italian Space Agency called Lares-2.

Italian rocket builder Avio manufacturers the Vega and Vega C launchers, which share the same Zefiro-9 third stage booster. Initial indications suggest the July 10 failure was related to Vega’s Zefiro-23 second stage booster, which will be replaced on Vega C with the more powerful Zefiro-40. Avio, Arianespace, and the French and European space agencies have not yet determined the cause of the launch failure.

Airbus’s four Pleiades Neo satellites are or were scheduled to launch in pairs, one in July 2020 and the second in early 2022 on Vega C missions, Pham said.

Pham said the Pleiades Neo and CO3D satellites are designed to be compatible with multiple Arianespace launchers, and that Airbus has included the ability to switch vehicles if necessary into those launch contracts.

“We have a backup policy with the launch authorities, so we will do all our efforts to remain on time and to get it done as planned,” he said.

Four CO3D satellites will take up half the space in a Vega C payload fairing, Pham said. He added that Airbus is closely following the development of small launch vehicles that could carry future CO3D satellites on dedicated missions.

Pham said Airbus is working with ground station operators Swedish Space Corporation and KSAT on strengthening their antenna networks to provide more links, particularly at medium latitudes. Airbus plans to rely on those networks to downlink imagery from the CO3D satellites.

Airbus and CNES plan to use data from the CO3D satellites to create a 3D map of the Earth’s landmass. CNES President Jean-Yves Le Gall hailed the program as one that “embodies French ambition and ingenuity.”

“It will allow a higher refresh rate, improved performance and better resilience,” he said. “This partnership between CNES and Airbus perfectly illustrates French excellence in Earth observation from space.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999967813491821}",neutral,0.9999967813491821,0
Airbus unveils new ‘bird of prey’ concept plane - CNN,"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWJpcmQtb2YtcHJleS1jb25jZXB0LXNjbGktaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

European manufacturer Airbus has created a concept aircraft inspired by the natural features of eagles, hawks and other aerial predators.

The “Bird of Prey” concept was unveiled by Liam Fox, UK Secretary of State for International Trade, at the Royal International Air Tattoo air show on Friday.

Fox tweeted his support for the project alongside a video of the “Bird of Prey,” which has a set of feathers on the tail and each wing tip.

Delighted to support the launch of the fantastic new @Airbus Bird of Prey concept airliner at the Royal International @AirTattoo show today.

The theoretical design is for a hybrid-electric, turbo-propeller aircraft, according to a statement on the Airbus website.

“Inspired by efficient mechanics of a bird, it has wing and tail structures that mimic those of a bird of prey, while featuring individually controlled feathers that provide active flight control,” the statement reads.

The aircraft would be capable of carrying up to 80 passengers and would burn 30%-50% less fuel than comparable aircraft in operation today.

While the aircraft won’t be built, the aim of the project is to motivate the next generation of aeronautical engineers, according to Martin Aston, a senior manager at Airbus.

“Our ‘Bird of Prey’ is designed to be an inspiration to young people and create a ‘wow’ factor that will help them consider an exciting career in the crucially-important aerospace sector,” Aston said in the statement.

Aston hopes the project will help to make aviation more sustainable, with cleaner, greener and quieter planes by taking design cues from nature.

“We know from our work on the A350 XWB passenger jet that through biomimicry, nature has some of the best lessons we can learn about design. Who can’t help but be inspired by such a creation?” he said.

Airbus has also been involved in developing new aircraft seat designs.

In February, British design company LAYER unveiled a prototype seat, designed for use in Airbus economy cabins on short to medium-haul flights, which promises fliers a more comfortable journey.

Dubbed “Move,” this concept seat is made of a fancy fiber that’s connected to built-in smart sensors – allowing passengers to manually control seat temperature, tension, pressure and movement, all via an app on their phone.

And in April, Airbus premiered its “Settee Corner” business class chair, which offers couch-style airplane seating, alongside all the usual business class features.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995694756507874}",neutral,0.9995694756507874,0
Airbus 1H2019 results: The A320neo gives Airbus a solid first half - Leeham News and Analysis,"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxOS8wNy8zMS9haXJidXMtMWgyMDE5LXJlc3VsdHMtdGhlLWEzMjBuZW8tZ2l2ZXMtYWlyYnVzLWEtc29saWQtZmlyc3QtaGFsZi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Bjorn Fehrm

July 31, 2019, ©. Leeham News: Airbus announced its 1H2019 results today, presenting a solid first half with progress in A320neo and A350 deliveries. The A220, brought over from Bombardier, is also making progress.

Yesterday, Airbus could announce an MOU with Air France for 60 A220-300. When converted to order it brings the orders for the type above 600. The A220 is gradually becoming a good deal for Airbus, and the type an important part of its lineup.

Progress on several fronts

Airbus’ revenue for 1H2019 was €30.9bn (€25.0bn 1H2018) with EBIT at €2.5bn (€1.2bn). The increase in revenue reflects the integration of the A220 in Airbus. The increase in EBIT is because of good A320neo deliveries and the A350 not consuming money any longer. The A220 is still in its money consuming ramp-up during 2019.

Guidance for 2019 remains at 880 to 890 aircraft deliveries with profits around €5bn, but it could be impacted by “growing trade tension” and a no-deal Brexit. A problem with deliveries of parts to Airbus wing factory in Wales could delay deliveries of Airbus aircraft as wing deliveries get delayed from the UK.

Civil aircraft

Commercial Aircraft, which makes 78% of revenue, had 88 (206 1H2018) net orders and 389 (303 1H2018) deliveries. The backlog is 7276 aircraft. Revenue for 1H2019 was €24.0bn (€18.5bn 1H2018) with EBIT at €2.2bn (€0.8bn).

The highlight is increased A320neo deliveries to 294 units (76 units 1H2018) with its good margins. The ACF version is still a challenge to produce but Airbus is investigating how to increase the production of this type as its variants, A321LR and XLR, are increasing in popularity.

The A350 is also running well with 53 1H deliveries (40 1H2018) and will be cash positive during the year.

The third program with solid progress is the A220 which could deliver 21 aircraft during the half-year, up from 10 last year. For the A220 the market interest is also positive with the recent MOU from Air France and expanded orders from Delta and jetBlue.

The A330neo is getting momentum with an order for 40 aircraft from Emirates in February. The A380 ramp down in going to plan according to Airbus.

Helicopters

Helicopters are still facing a flat market. The unit is maintaining revenue at €2.4bn (€2.4bn 1H2018) with EBIT at €0.1bn (€0.1bn).

Defense and Space

Defense and Space increase revenue to €5.0bn (€4.7bn 1H2018) with EBIT at €0.2bn (€0.3bn). The highlight was an agreement with the Customers around the re-baselining of the A440M program after protracted negotiations.

"Inside the 20-year forecasts at Airbus, Boeing and Embraer - Runway Girl Network","Sat, 06 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTkvMDcvaW5zaWRlLXRoZS0yMC15ZWFyLWZvcmVjYXN0cy1hdC1haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLWFuZC1lbWJyYWVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Making sense of the dueling twenty-year market demand forecasts between airframers is a mix of art and science, as Airbus, Boeing, and Embraer in particular predict — and indeed, with these forecasts and the strategies they execute based on them, shape — different futures.

This year the analysis is even more complicated owing to the lack of apples-to-apples comparisons with previous years for a number of reasons: Airbus’ integration of the A220 at the bottom end of its forecasts; Airbus’ removal of the X-Large category at the top of its forecasts following the sunsetting of the A380 program; and Boeing and Embraer’s proposed integration, where the two airframers are officially still putting out separate statistics with markedly different headline numbers.

To get a notional monthly run rate for the forecast, let’s assume a 50% split between the duopoly, divided by 20 years and then 12 months. The formula of ((total/2)/20)/12 gives us a run rate of 0.21%.

Airbus hasn’t officially updated its market forecasts for 2019, but chief commercial officer Christian Scherer revealed a few high-level numbers at a pre-briefing before the Paris Air Show.

“Our global market forecast sees over the next 20 years a little bit more than 37,000 commercial aircraft delivered into this market, of which about 28,500 are single-aisle. The medium category we see about 5,500, and in the larger category about 3,300 aircraft,” Scherer said.

Airbus’ “small” single-aisle segment on Scherer’s slides were split into the A220, né Bombardier C Series, and the “A320 family”, which used an A320neo as illustration.

Separated from the “A320 family” on the “medium” slide was the A321neo — interestingly using the livery of the A321LR neo variant, but with the A321neo label — and the A330neo. (This slide was prior to the launch of the A321XLR at Le Bourget.)

“Large”, following the demise of the A380 program, comprises the A350 family, with both the -900 and -1000 shown on Scherer’s slides. Last year, 1,360 aircraft were in Airbus’ X-Large category, now folded into “Large”.

Boeing’s published 2019 market forecast, meanwhile, forecasts a market some fifteen percent larger: a total of just over 44,000 aircraft. It splits the market into four categories:

90 seats and below, for which Boeing forecasts 2,240 aircraft

90 seats and above: 32,420 aircraft

Widebody: 8,340 aircraft

Freighter widebody: 1,040 aircraft

Embraer, for its part, forecasts 10,550 aircraft in its sub-150-passenger market segment, markedly more than Boeing in this space, as Boeing’s commercial airplanes vice president of marketing Randy Tinseth elaborated after unveiling Boeing’s forecast numbers. (For comparison, in its last commercial market forecast in 2017, Bombardier forecast 6,800 “small single aisle aircraft” plus 5,750 “large regional aircraft”.)

Comparing these numbers is complex given the overlaps between Airbus’ “small” and “medium”, Boeing’s two narrowbody categories, and Embraer’s 150-passenger ceiling. But followups at the Paris Air Show shed some further light on the matter.

Tinseth elaborated slightly on certain sub-markets and cross-markets in his Le Bourget briefing, suggesting a middle-of-the-market category comprising between 4,000 and 5,000 airplanes.

“Those airplanes would come from three different places,” Tinseth explained. “They would come from upgauging out of the single-aisle market. They come from down-gauging in the twin-aisle market that we see today. And if you build an airplane right, and you truly optimize it for that marketplace, you’ll actually stimulate that market.”

That would roughly correspond to the “medium”, AKA A321LR/XLR plus A330neo, category for Airbus, which seems to roughly agree on the size of the middle of the market.

At the lower end of the scale, Tinseth admitted in response to a question about demand around the 100-passenger jet market from Runway Girl Network that, “101 and below… you know, we just don’t tend to share that, so I thought I’d take a look at the MAX 7 and below.” Boeing lists the MAX 7 in a two-class configuration as holding between 138-153 passengers, with a max-pax of 172.

For that segment, Tinseth said, “If you were to take the market from the MAX 7 and go down into the regional jet market, that’s a significant market: it’s about 5,000 airplanes over the next 20 years. That’s a combination of the MAX 7, as well as C Series airplanes, as well as Embraer. It is a significant market. What makes the Embraer airplane work so well for us is that it complements our family in terms of size and capabilities. There’s no overlap.”

Crucially, the market strategies of the two primary airframers drive and are driven by these forecasts. Questions remain to be answered, though, as the sales activities of the programs now comprising Airbus Canada and Boeing Brasil – Commercial accelerate, as the amount of the lower-middle of the market the A321XLR can knock out becomes clear, and as Airbus and Boeing continue to price the A330neo and 787 aggressively to punch downwards from the upper-middle.

The first of these jets is scheduled for delivery in August 2019. In the next few days, the aircraft will receive the red and white Austrian color scheme in Jacksonville, FL. A total of ten additional jets will replace the 18 Dash 8-400 turboprop aircraft by 2021. Austrian will thus increase its Airbus fleet from 36 to 46 aircraft. As of June 30, 2019, the entire Austrian Airlines fleet consisted of 82 aircraft.

Austrian Airlines CCO Andreas Otto explained the strategic fleet development: ""These six additional A320s should also be understood as a strong signal towards low cost competition. We are defending our market position and are determined to fight for our customers.""

Four A320 aircraft from Avianca Brasil, two from Juneyao

Four of the six additional A320 jets are leased from Aviation Capital and were previously flown by Avianca Brasil. These aircraft are already undergoing the necessary delivery check. The first A320 plane is expected to be transferred to Austrian Airlines in mid-August. Additional planes will be supplied at the end of August, as well as in September and October of this year. Following the necessary modifications and adaptations, the first aircraft should be operating on Austrian Airlines’ behalf in December 2019. Austrian Airlines will take possession of two other Airbus jets, purchased from CDB Aviation, which are currently operated by Star Alliance Connecting Partner Juneyao.

Dash phase-out occurring

In 2019, Austrian Airlines already decommissioned two Dash aircraft. The handover of an additional Dash turboprop is planned for later this year. Nine other Dash turboprops are scheduled to be phased out from the Austrian Airlines fleet in the course of 2020; the remaining six will follow in 2021.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998522996902466}",neutral,0.9998522996902466,0

Through the first six months of the year, Airbus has delivered 150 more jets than Boeing. According to sales figures reported this week, Airbus has sold 389 aircraft compared to Boeing's 239.

The gap between production will most likely continue to grow as Boeing struggles to come up with a solution to the issues plaguing their 737 Max planes.

Both Boeing and Airbus have been the leaders in the commercial aircraft market for years. It is believed that a backlog of orders that production facilities extremely busy.

The demand for air travel continues to grow as does the desire for more eco-friendly aircraft.

The vibe from the Paris air show was that the A321XLR was a good start – but by no means snuffs out Boeing's ambitions for its own mid-market programme, the New Mid-market Airplane (NMA).

The expected arrival of the 4,700nm (8,700km)-range A320 family variant, due in 2023, will finally give Airbus a single-aisle aircraft that easily has the measure of the aircraft that has been the benchmark in this sector for many years – the Boeing 757-200. It also marks an incredible evolution of an enlarged A320 variant that started life in May 1989 as a ""simple stretch"" – almost like the fairy tale of the ugly duckling maturing into an elegant swan.

The main changes introduced with the new variant when it was launched were two fuselage plugs – 4.3m (14ft) forward and 2.7m aft – which boosted a typical two-class seating configuration by around 25 passengers, increased weights, and double-slotted flaps in place of the A320's single-slotted configuration. The trailing edge was also modified slightly to include a small chord extension in a clean configuration to provide for a slight increase in wing area.

The aircraft was powered by versions of the A320's existing CFM International CFM56 and IAE V2500 engines, namely the -5B and -A5, respectively. They were available at thrust levels up to around 33,000lb (156kN), somewhat higher than offered on the A320.

The A321 was formally launched in November 1989. Appropriately, its first order was placed by the leasing company then run by Steve Udvar-Hazy – ILFC – with a commitment for 16 aircraft. Udvar-Hazy was on hand at Paris last month when his current leasing vehicle, Air Lease, became the first customer to sign for the A321XLR on the opening day of the show.

The A321LR variant arrived in 2018: 4,000nm, 206 passengers

Airbus

The A321 launched in baseline -100 form in January 1994 with Lufthansa. This variant weighed in at a maximum take-off weight (MTOW) of 83t and could carry a typical two-class load of 186 passengers over 2,300nm. A higher weight -200 arrived two years later featuring a higher 89t MTOW. The addition in the freight hold of a single additional centre tank (ACT), with a capacity of 2,990 litres (790USgal) in the shape of an LD-6 cargo container, extended the range to 2,700nm.

HARMONISATION

Airbus quickly standardised A321 production around the -200 platform, so all aircraft delivered from April 1997 were built to the higher specification. In 2000, deliveries began of a slightly heavier A321-200 with an MTOW of 93.5t. Coupled with extra fuel capacity via two ACTs, the higher weight enabled 3,000nm missions to be flown which in theory provided US transcontinental range to match the capability of its smaller sibling, the A320.

While the A321 had proved popular with customers and provided an Airbus single-aisle with similar capacity to the 757-200, the original platform was never able to match the payload range performance of its rival. The lighter A321 was economically superior when range was not a factor but the 757, with its larger wing, higher weights and more powerful engines, offered impressive single-aisle capability with its range of up to 4,000nm.

Sales of the A321 were sluggish compared with the A320. By the time of the A320neo family launch in 2010, A321ceo orders had steadily risen towards the 900-unit threshold (passing 1,000 orders during 2011). In comparison, A320ceo orders were around 4,500 units.

The launch of the A320neo was a bold decision at the time that not only energised sales of the baseline A320 but has transformed the value proposition of the A321, even though the re-engining exercise added about 1.8t in weight. Finally, Airbus had a product that could hold its head high against the 757 – albeit an aircraft that had been out of production for half a decade by then.

Recalling the decision to launch the re-engined A320 for Flight International's 'Airbus at 50' supplement earlier this year, the manufacturer's former engineering boss and chief operating officer Tom Williams said it was not completely straightforward.

""That was a big decision because the fear was that we'd end up destroying the current orderbook, customers would defer and so on. And the A320 was of course the cash cow of the business,"" he said.

""The other concern was that if we tinker with this product, at what point do we do something that becomes dysfunctional?""

The original motivation behind the re-engining was concern about the threat from Bombardier and its CSeries (ironically a programme now run by Airbus as the A220).

""We launched the A320neo with the express purpose of killing the CSeries,"" he says.

""Our internal modelling of an all-new aeroplane [design] showed it was only going to bring another 3% of performance improvement over the [re-engined] A320neo's 15%. It was an argument that said the all-new single-aisle really needs to wait until the next step of engine technology, like contra-rotating open rotors, and that's not going to come until the latter part of the next decade, so we should get on and do this re-engining.""

In the run-up to the introduction of the re-engined family, Airbus developed a winglet modification for both current and Neo versions dubbed the ""sharklet"", which delivers a performance improvement of up to 3%.

The baseline A321neo utilised the existing weight options offered on its predecessor, and the variant followed the A320neo in the development plan (although at one stage the A321neo was slated to trail the A319neo in the timetable). The re-engined A321 is offered with the CFM Leap-1A33 rated at 32,900lb thrust and the Pratt & Whitney PW1133G providing 32,700lb thrust (both at ""Airbus equivalent thrust"" ratings).

The re-engined stretch proved so popular that by the time of its first flight in February 2016 its orderbook (1,114 aircraft) had already exceeded sales of the 757. Meanwhile, the A321ceo had enjoyed a sales surge, with orders having more than doubled from 2010 to 1,642 aircraft.

Fairly early in the A321neo's development, Airbus identified a way to increase the cabin's certificated maximum capacity through a redesign of the door layout and changes in the cabin arrangement (including a recessed galley). Dubbed ""Airbus Cabin Flex"" (ACF), the changes effectively ""stretch"" the A321 by boosting maximum seating by 24 seats to 244 passengers.

The ACF configuration was introduced into the production flow in 2018 but early A321neos were built with the original door arrangement and some customers are still opting for that version to retain compatibility with existing fleets.

Boeing's 757-200 has long led the sector

The ACF configuration is the cornerstone of an extended-range A321neo variant launched in 2015 and branded as the A321LR. Officially, there is no A321LR-designated variant in the A321neo product line-up. It is in fact a variation of the new A321-200NX build-standard, based on the ACF platform.

ENHANCEMENTS

This variant was introduced with the new build standard in 2018, incorporating structural changes allowing up to a 4t MTOW increase to 97t. The -200NX can be equipped with up to three ACTs (one forward and up to two aft) to create an ultimate capability of flying a 4,000nm mission with 206 passengers in two classes. The LR's ACTs are slightly larger than the previous version, each with a capacity of 3,120 litres providing about 250nm more range.

With the introduction of the LR (incorporating three ACTs), Airbus finally had an A321 capable of challenging the 757, while at the same time achieving a 25% lower cost per seat. But customers still had an appetite for more performance. Airbus saw an opportunity to refine the A321neo further to meet these needs and at the same time create a disruptive force in the sector targeted by Boeing with its NMA.

After much speculation, Airbus formally unveiled the A321XLR on the opening day of the Paris air show, with deliveries due to begin in early 2023. Derived from the LR (or -200NX), the XLR (designated A321-200NY) has structural reinforcements to allow the MTOW to increase by up to 4t to 101t. Powered by the LR's current CFM International Leap-1A and PW1100G engines, the XLR features a 12,900 litre permanent rear centre fuel tank (RCT) which holds the equivalent of four ACTs.

Another key change is a redesign of the inboard double-slotted flaps into a single-slotted design. This saves weight and reduces drag while maintaining take-off and landing V-speeds equivalent to the A320ceo, says Airbus.

But significantly, no decision has been made yet over whether this major piece of engineering will be introduced as a block change, thereby simplifying the number of build-standards offered on the A321. Complexity of specification options on the current A321 is an issue that has been hampering Airbus production for some time already, leading to lengthy delivery delays.

The design changes will allow the XLR to operate a 4,700nm mission with an optional ACT installed in the forward hold. Airbus chief commercial officer Christian Scherer says this typical long-range mission would probably involve a two- or three-class layout and seating for ""around 200"" passengers. He adds that the RCT fuel tank has a weight ""equivalent"" of a single ACT and the volume of four ACTs, but only occupies the space in the cargo hold of two.

Air Lease was the first to sign up for the XLR, placing 27 firm orders, and the lessor's chief executive, John Plueger, is confident that the new model will be very popular.

""I think you're going to see this aircraft become highly used transatlantic and between north America and south America. Already we have huge expressions of interest from many of our current A320neo and A321neo customers – we see huge demand,"" he says.

""This airplane is hugely efficient compared to widebody aircraft that it might replace in some of these [middle to long-range] market places.""

The A321-100 trailing-edge

Max-Kingsley-Jones/FlightGlobal

In total, Airbus secured strong backing for the XLR's launch with orders and commitments from 12 customers for 249 A321XLRs, including a mix of new orders and conversions from other A320-family orders.

Airbus has not disclosed the catalogue price for the new variant, but it is understood to be priced at a small premium over the LR versions. However, sources indicate that the airframer was offering some sporty ""one night only"" deals to encourage existing A320neo customers to switch over to the XLR and be part of the launch party.

Over the three decades since the A321 was originally launched, Airbus has more than doubled the aircraft's range, raised the MTOW by over 20% and delivered a 10% increase in maximum seating without extending the fuselage. Cirium's Fleets Analyzer shows that total orders for the A321neo variants are just shy of 2,400 aircraft, while the entire A321 orderbook is approaching 4,200 aircraft.

Altogether, the A321 accounts for just over one-quarter of all Airbus single-aisle sales, while the re-engined version makes up over one-third of all A320neo orders. But given the current sales momentum and the energising of its capabilities with the LR and XLR variants, just how successful can the A321neo family be?

""Airbus themselves predicted historically that the A321 would account for up to 50% of A320-family deliveries in the future,"" says Rob Morris, global head of consultancy at Ascend by Cirium. ""Whilst there are clearly constraints that have prevented this in the past, the advent of the XLR can only help towards this 'goal', since it further enhances the already strong proposition offered to the market by the A321neo.""

Morris says that the significant performance enhancements offered by the XLR equate to enhanced network flexibility, so the variant can be expected to be ""a reasonably good seller"".

But he wonders how well sales will compare to the baseline A321neo ACF variants (ie, the 200NX): ""I think it depends upon the structural weight delta between the XLR and the ACF (when enabled for three ACTs but not necessarily installed). Does the XLR's permanent tank cost airlines much in weight – and thus unit cost terms – and is the loss of the hold capacity (for the fixed tank) material to revenue?""

Morris says that if the answer to either or both is marginal, it is difficult to see why customers would not want the flexibility the XLR offers. If the impact of either is material, then the XLR market will be more niche.

""I think the initial sales indications, with a number of customers trading orders up to the XLR, is already telling us that airlines are going to like the product. But in overall terms I think it is too early to tell exactly how much they like it and thus what portion of A321neo sales in the long term will be XLR,"" adds Morris.

Scherer predicts ""hundreds"" of A321XLR orders and the manufacturer is understood to have conservatively estimated demand for at least 1,500 XLRs. This may well be a mix of orders that would have already gone the A321LR's way as well as incremental business, but the XLR's arrival effectively lets Toulouse ""park the (Air) bus"" in front of the goal Boeing is aiming at with the NMA.

"50 years after the A300, its PaxEx echoes in newest Airbus widebodies - Runway Girl Network","Wed, 03 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTkvMDcvNTAteWVhcnMtYWZ0ZXItdGhlLWEzMDAtaXRzLXBheGV4LWVjaG9lcy1pbi1uZXdlc3QtYWlyYnVzLXdpZGVib2RpZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Five decades after the launch of the Airbus A300, its direct descendent the A330neo continues to show how the design of Airbus’ first aircraft influences the passenger experience of today, and nowhere was this shown so clearly as at this year’s Paris Air Show, the same event at which the A300 was unveiled all those years ago.

From the new 460-passenger maximum capacity for the A300-900neo, to orders from Cebu Pacific and Virgin Atlantic at two extremes of #PaxEx, from the AirAsia X and Air Mauritius interiors on show at similar extremes, this evolutionary aircraft may well be the final chapter in the story of the A300, Airbus’ first jet, which celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of its programme launch at the 1969 Paris Air Show.

The A330 started life as the A300-B9, a stretched version of Airbus’ first aircraft, the development sizing of which was initially planned with the B-codes 1-9, as seen in the A300-B4 and -B6, before Airbus started incrementing aircraft names by tens instead. The A310, or A300-B10, came later, as did the A340, or A300-B11.

Design-wise, the A330 — including the re-engined, re-cabined A330neo — shares much with the A300 from a passenger experience viewpoint, notably including its 5.64m (18 feet, six inches) wide fuselage, arranged in its standard economy class 2-4-2 configuration, with a high-density version in a 3-3-3 layout.

Both configurations remain offered on the shared fuselage today, despite Airbus’ recent tilt towards suggesting that even full-service premium airlines might like to add the tighter version to their cabin portfolios. And, indeed, both layouts were on show at Le Bourget this year, giving a useful comparison.

On the more comfortable, feature-filled side, it was Air Mauritius’ A330neo with its 2-4-2 configuration containing 260 economy class seats with a generous 32” pitch and an on-demand inflight entertainment system from Thales that would have astounded the designers and passengers of fifty years ago.

AirAsia X’s A330neo, meanwhile, isn’t quite a Cebu Pacific max-pax version, but its 377-seater is certainly up there in terms of capacity on account of the nine-abreast seating in economy class, offering over a hundred economy seats more than Air Mauritius on the same aircraft.

The only bell or whistle is a power socket, and one can’t help but wonder what the first cabin outfitters would have made of the need for that. BYO record player and pop a stack of 45s in the hat-rack?

But on the basics, “now everyone can fly longhaul” is the AirAsia X motto, and indeed extending the privilege of being able to afford air travel to more passengers is one of AirAsia’s stated goals.

Larger travelers may well not have the greatest time flying longhaul down the back. In fairness to AirAsia X, though, it’s very inexpensive, the seat pitch isn’t bad even in the cheap seats, it provides a very simple way to book an extra seat, and it offers twelve angled lie-flat seats up front.

These seats are, as with the A300’s initial premium cabin — then first class — arranged in a 2-2-2 layout of largely recliner seats. Indeed, Air Transat, the largest western operator of A300-family aircraft in its A310s, still offers this configuration in its Club Class seating.

Today, of course, that sort of widebody recliner experience is primarily premium economy, which is universally experienced on the A330 and indeed the A330neo in a 2-3-2 layout.

Up front on Air Mauritius, meanwhile, the Stelia Solstys seats are a solid staggered product in a 1-2-1 layout, the technology behind which is so far beyond what was available on the original A300 to be almost akin to magic.

But the A300 has influences beyond its direct descendants. In the early development years of the programme, the design of the aircraft that would become the A300 was much larger, with a fuselage width somewhere between the 777 and 747, and a length to sit some 300 passengers.

The A300 shrank to its eventual size partly due to market demand for smaller aircraft — shades of the A380, perhaps? — and partly due to engine availability, a subject which is of course not unfamiliar to any airframer today.

Indeed, the A350 XWB, whose -900 base model is listed at starting 300 passengers and whose “extra wide body” is at the crossroads of Airbus’ strategic passenger experience decisions, bears something of a passing resemblance to this first Airbus concept.

Airbus Helicopters shares more details on electric backup system - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2FpcmJ1cy1oZWxpY29wdGVycy1kZXRhaWxzLWVsZWN0cmljLWJhY2t1cC1zeXN0ZW0v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The electric backup system (EBS) Airbus Helicopters is studying could bring benefits in safety, payload and noise footprint for single-engine helicopters, said Tomasz Krysinski, the company’s vice president of research and innovation.

Airbus believes it now has a convincing business case for its electric backup system for single-engine helicopters. Thierry Dubois Photo

The manufacturer is planning on demonstrating the use of the EBS, which it describes as a “hybrid propulsion system,” on an H130 light single in 2020.

The EBS would be based on a 100 kW motor and 1 kWh lithium-ion batteries. Under a parallel hybrid architecture, the motor will be connected to the main gearbox. The EBS will thus be able to power the rotor for about 30 seconds.

The main improvement from an EBS, as shown in flight on a modified AS350 AStar in 2011, would be seen in case of an engine failure.

The system would not be powerful enough to act as a second engine. But it would make autorotation safer by maintaining the rotor’s rotation speed constant. The pilot would have more time to react, and would not have to push the collective stick within a critical couple of seconds.

The EBS would then provide some power at flare, making that final landing phase easier.

The technical demonstration eight years ago was successful. However, due to the weight of the system, which was cutting the payload by an unspecified but significant proportion, no business case could be found.

Key in the current project is the swift progress electric devices have made. This is the case for the motors Thales will supply, at 5 kW/kg (2.3 kW/lb.), Krysinski noted. The batteries Airbus Defence & Space will provide will have better energy density, by a factor of two, than the ones used in 2011.

As a result, the system is expected to weigh 75 kg (165 lb.), said Krysinski.

But the second source of power will be harnessed to increase the certified payload. Thanks to the electric 100 kW, the same flight envelope (defined in altitude and speed) can be used with a greater maximum takeoff weight. In case of engine failure, the EBS will help keep the helicopter in the certified flight envelope.

Its power will enable carrying 150 kg (330 lb.) on top of the existing maximum take-off weight, said Krysinski. This will translate into a 75 kg payload improvement (as the system itself weighs 75 kg).

The third benefit of the EBS will make a helicopter a better neighbor, according to Krysinski.

Blade tip speed creates the most annoying contribution to the rotorcraft’s external noise. One could imagine slowing down the rotor to cut that noise, when only part of the rotor’s maximum lift is needed. This is not usually done because, in case of an emergency situation, the pilot would need to accelerate back to the rotor’s nominal speed very quickly. This would be incompatible with the inertia of a turbine engine.

On the contrary, the responsiveness of an electric motor will allow reduced rotor speed operations in an urban environment, Krysinski said.

The EBS is now at technology readiness level (TRL) 4, which means it is a research project. Airbus intends, thanks to two to three months of flight testing next year, to reach TRL 6 — the required level to launch the development of a product.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8467741012573242}",positive,0.8467741012573242,1

Some analysts predict this order lost to Europe's Airbus won't be the last such loss for Boeing.

Boeing continues to work on fixing software that likely led to two deadly crashes and the model's grounding earlier this year.

Deliveries of 737 models including the Max dropped sharply in the second quarter, Boeing said Tuesday

Boeing officially lost its first order to European rival Airbus in the aftermath of two deadly 737 Max crashes and the subsequent grounding of the plane by global regulators. Some analysts think this cancellation won't be the last.

Indeed, orders for all 737 models including the Max fell by more than half through June, figures released by Boeing on Tuesday show. The planemaker delivered 113 of the model plane through June compared to 269 of all 737s in the first half of 2018. Boeing doesn't break out deliveries for the Max from other 737 aircraft.

In the quarter running April, May and June, combined deliveries of 737 models fell to just 24 from 137. The company reports second-quarter results July 24, when it typically provides an update on its order and delivery outlook.

The first lost order for a 737 Max was from Flyadeal, the budget airline run by Saudi Arabian Airlines. It announced Sunday it will buy up to 50 Airbus A320neo planes, the competing narrowbody model to Boeing's 737 Max, and operate an all-Airbus fleet. The move reverses a December plan to buy up to 50 737 Max planes valued at $5.9 billion, based on list prices.

While it's the first official switch since the 737 Max was grounded, Indonesian carrier Garuda said earlier this year it was talking to Boeing about canceling its order after Boeing delivered just one of the 50 737 Max jets. Together, the two orders are valued at roughly $10 billion, at list prices, though carriers are often offered substantial discounts.

""I don't think we've seen the ends of these announcements,"" industry analyst Henry Harteveldt of Atmosphere Research Group told CBS News' Kris Van Cleave. ""The big issue is Airbus' production capacity. Airbus needs to find ways to increase its production capacity for its A320 line of aircraft, which isn't easy to do.""

Other carriers also are weighing options. Oman Air said in June it would start talks with Airbus if Boeing didn't provide ""support and recovery"" for the 737 Max. In April, flydubai said it may consider an Airbus order to replace its Max order.

Before the 737 Max crashes, the world's two biggest plane makers were already dealing with huge backlogs and had been increasing production to meet rising global demand. The cancellation itself is a small dent in Boeing's backlog for the bestselling 737, including the Max version. Boeing's order backlog for the 737 model stands at 4,415, according to its website.

Saudi Arabian Airlines booked its Airbus order at the Paris Air Show last month as part of 100 planes it plans to buy from Airbus, according to Sunday's statement from the carrier. In a statement today, Boeing said it's ""proud of its seven-decade long partnership with Saudi Arabia's aviation industry and we wish the flyadeal team well as it builds out its operations. Our team continues to focus on safely returning the 737 Max to service and resuming deliveries of Max airplanes.""

Delayed return?



Saudi Arabia Airlines' current fleet already include 52 narrowbody Airbus aircraft, according to its website. Its Boeing aircraft are all larger models, known as widebodies. Saudi Arabia is also a big military customer for Boeing.

Last month, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration discovered a new flaw in Boeing's 737 Max that could further delay its return to the skies. Still, some airlines are ordering the 737 Max. Boeing in June announced a letter of intent from International Airlines Group, parent company of British Airways and other carriers, to buy 200 of the model.

Boeing last week said it would pay $100 million to the victims of the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes.

Airbus is working to inspire the latest in flight innovation – and using a ""bird of prey"" conceptual design to do so.

The company premiered the design in the U.K. at the Royal International Air Tattoo air show last week: ""A hybrid-electric, turbo-propeller aircraft for regional air transportation,"" according to a press release. Its wings and tail structure were designed to copy that of a bird of prey because of birds' ""efficient mechanics.""

This concept is just that – a concept. The ""bird of prey"" is meant to give insight into what a regional aircraft might look like in the future. It has components like ""a blended wing-to-fuselage joint"" meant to reflect the arch of an eagle or falcon.

""Our 'Bird of Prey' is designed to be an inspiration to young people and create a 'wow' factor that will help them consider an exciting career in the crucially-important aerospace sector,” Martin Aston, a senior manager at Airbus, said in a statement. ""One of the priorities for the entire industry is how to make aviation more sustainable – making flying cleaner, greener and quieter than ever before. We know from our work on the A350 XWB passenger jet that through biomimicry, nature has some of the best lessons we can learn about design. Who can’t help but be inspired by such a creation?""

Is Airbus Doing Enough to Stop the Fumes that are Making People Sick? - View from the Wing,"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9pcy1haXJidXMtZG9pbmctZW5vdWdoLXRvLXN0b3AtdGhlLWZ1bWVzLXRoYXQtYXJlLW1ha2luZy1wZW9wbGUtc2ljay_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On July 17, 2015 a Spirit Airlines Airbus A319 flying from Chicago O’Hare to Boston is said to have reported a strong smell of dirty socks as the plane began its descent. There were apparently issues with the cockpit crew communicating with air traffic control, including acknowledging the correct handoff frequency. The first officer put on his oxygen mask, “recovered a bit and recognized that the captain had sunk into his seat and was incapacitated.” The first officer then placed a mask on the captain and they landed the aircraft — although the flight crew “did not recall how they managed to land or taxi the aircraft.”

The aircraft’s captain was diagnosed with triorthocresyl phosphate poisoning and internal bleeding and reported several symptoms for days, and had difficulty upon returning to duty.

[F]ollowing the fume event, after the captain returned to work following the fume event, the collegues noticed that the captain became increasingly dithering and unreliable. The captain lost eye and hand coordination as well as threedimensional perceiption. One day the captain parked his aircraft in such a way, that the crew taking the aircraft over the next day feared the captain might have been intoxicated.

Fifty days after the flight incident he died of a heart attack which is suspected to be related to the toxins from the plane.

Both pilots of a Germanwings Airbus A319 were nearly incapacitated by fumes in the cockpit on December 19, 2010 on approach to Cologne, Germany.

On January 28, 2018 a Spirit Airlines Airbus A320 that same aircraft experienced a fume event where crew and passengers vomited.

On October 1 2018 a Spirit Airlines Airbus A319 experienced fumes in the passenger cabin shortly after departure from Fort Lauderdale. The crew decided to continue to Guayaquil, Ecuador. At least six passengers required medical care on arrival, and all of the flight attendants were taken to the hospital.

[A] number of passengers began to complain about feeling sick due to an odour described as rotten smell by some or dirty old socks by others, all three cabin crew began to feel unwell, too. The flight crew was notified of the fumes however decided to continue the flight to Guayaquil. Medlink was called to provide first medical assistance to passengers and cabin crew, the passengers were offered oxygen. Passengers reported nausea, burning eyes, upset stomach and headache. One of the flight attendants began to vomit, another one was shaking and nearly became unconscious, the third complained about nausea and headache with burning eyes. Rashes developed.

On April 2, 2019, an American Airlines Airbus A321 diverted to Wilmington, North Carolina reporting fumes in the cockpit.

On April 17, 2019, an Air Canada Rouge Airbus A319 returned to Toronto due to an odor in the cockpit. Then on April 23, 2019, an Air Canada Rouge Airbus A319 reported fumes in the cockpit, pilots donned oxygen masks, and the aircraft diverted to Raleigh, North Carolina.

On May 3, 2019, a Spirit Airlines Airbus A321 returned to Los Angeles 40 minutes after departure due to an odor in the cockpit and the cabin, and a passenger was hospitalized.

On June 8, 2019, British Airways pilots of an Airbus A321 donned their oxygen masks due to fumes on board while descending into Copenhagen. The same aircraft had fume events June 15 and June 23.

On June 29, 2019 a Spirit Airlines Airbus A320 stopped its climb out and returned to Atlantic City due to fumes on board, and crew were taken to the hospital as a precaution.

On July 7, 2019 a Spirit Airlines Airbus A321 had reported fumes in the cabin throughout flight from Tampa to Orlando. Some members of the flight crew were hospitalized on arrival. The airline concluded that “too much oil was used to service the auxiliary power unit.”

In 2013 Airbus warned of fume events from failure to clean environmental systems following leaks, and suggesting “A clean APU means clean cabin air.”

Air supplied by the Environmental Conditioning System (ECS) can be contaminated by the unavoidable ingestion of environmental pollutants such as industrial pollution as well as engine exhaust pollution from the many vehicles and aircraft operating in the airport environment. Since the ECS is supplied with air from the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), engine bleed system or Ground Power Units (GPU), there is also a possibility of contamination from these. One source of in-service contamination events reported on the A320 Family fleet is the APU. This results from either internal leakage or re-ingestion of oil following external leakage. It is worth noting that a noticeable cabin odour can be generated from ingesting only a very small amount of oil.

There are scores of Airbus narrowbody fume incidents across diverse carriers — including some fume occurrences leading to flight diversions and hospitalized passengers and crew — across JetBlue, Austrian, British Airways, American Airlines, Spirit, Lufthansa, easyJet, Aer Lingus, Jetstar, Germanwings, Turkish, Air France, Delta and others.

Dangerous fume events are rare overall. Over 8000 Airbus A320 family aircraft have been delivered. Most operate multiple flights per day. So these are outlier events.

On the other hand the majority of reported fume events in recent times have seemed to occur in Airbus narrowbodies. Airbus, airlines, the FAA and international regulators are familiar with and have paid attention to these events and yet they keep occurring. We don’t hear about them as a systematic issue, and I have to wonder if Airbus is doing enough, proactively enough, about it?","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9438566565513611}",neutral,0.9438566565513611,0

Airbus Canada has delivered more aircraft in its first year than the total delivered up to July 1, 2018, when it took the lead of the program.*

In total, the A220 ends the first year of Airbus leading the program with a healthy firm order book of over 500 aircraft, plus 80 additional commitments announced at this year’s Paris Air Show including from leading international lessors, indicating strong demand for the aircraft in markets worldwide.

“This has been a year of growth and accomplishment for the A220,” said Philippe Balducchi, CEO of Airbus Canada Limited Partnership and Country Head, Airbus Canada. “This truly innovative Quebec-born aircraft is making its mark on the aviation industry around the world. It is thanks to the strong collaboration with our customers, partners, suppliers and all our employees that we have made great strides to ensuring the success of the A220 for many years to come.”

* Airbus will publish its order and delivery numbers for the month of June 2019 in the coming days.

A year of many A220 achievements

In January 2019, Airbus held a ground-breaking ceremony for its new A220 manufacturing facility in Mobile, Alabama, where A220 aircraft for the U.S. market will be assembled, using essentially the same supply chain as for aircraft assembled in Mirabel. The Mobile facility is currently under construction and the start of aircraft assembly work will be in Q3 this year, with the first delivery planned for the middle of next year. Airbus employees from the A220 facility in Mobile have already started their training activities in Mirabel.

At the primary A220 facility in Mirabel, two new dome structures were built early this year to provide additional space to accommodate the increased pace of production. The new five-year labour contract approved by unionized Mirabel employees on June 15, 2019, calls for the construction of an additional “pre-assembly” facility.

One of the highlights of the past year was the first delivery of an Airbus A220 aircraft to a U.S.-based airline. Delta Air Lines took delivery of the first of 90 A220s it has ordered at a ceremony at Mirabel in October 2018 and conducted the first revenue-earning flight of an A220 in the Americas on February 7, 2019, from New York’s La Guardia Airport to Boston’s Logan Airport.

In December 2018, Air Tanzania took delivery of its first A220 aircraft, becoming a new customer for Airbus and the first African operator of the A220. At present, six airlines based on four continents are operating A220 aircraft: airBaltic, Air Tanzania, Delta Air Lines, EgyptAir, Korean Airlines and Swiss.

Mirabel employees delivered two major milestones for Airbus globally during the past year. In December, they completed and delivered the company’s 800th aircraft of the year, allowing Airbus to meet that important objective for the year. In May 2019, an A220 for Delta Air Lines was the 12,000th aircraft delivered by Airbus since its founding 50 years ago.

Another key accomplishment for the A220 program was the receipt in January 2019 of certification from Transport Canada for the aircraft to operate up to 180 minutes away from an airport, permitting it to fly new direct non-limiting routings over water, remote or underserved regions.

Mirabel-based engineers continue to make improvements to the A220 aircraft. In May 2019, Airbus announced it will increase the maximum take-off weight of the A220 by 2,268 kg, which will increase the aircraft’s range by 450 nautical miles (nm) or 830 km. This increases the range of the A220-100 to 3,400 nm (6,300 km) and the larger A220-300 to 3,350 nm (6,200 km), enabling flights from Montreal to London or from Vancouver to Cuba.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999958276748657}",positive,0.9999958276748657,1
Saudi carrier cancels troubled Boeing 737 order for Airbus - Phys.org,"Mon, 08 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE5LTA3LXNhdWRpLWNhcnJpZXItY2FuY2Vscy1ib2VpbmctYWlyYnVzLmh0bWzSAUVodHRwczovL3BoeXMub3JnL25ld3MvMjAxOS0wNy1zYXVkaS1jYXJyaWVyLWNhbmNlbHMtYm9laW5nLWFpcmJ1cy5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In this March 27, 2019, file photo, a Boeing 737 MAX 8 airplane is shown on the assembly line during a brief media tour in Boeing's 737 assembly facility, in Renton, Wash.

Boeing's campaign to restore the reputation of its best-selling plane after two deadly crashes suffered a blow with a Saudi airline canceling an order worth up to $5.9 billion in favor of a European rival of the U.S. manufacturer.

Flyadeal, the budget airline arm of Saudi Arabian Airlines Corp., ordered 30 A320neo jets from Airbus and took options on 20 more, meaning that its entire fleet will consist of planes from that company.

It's a potentially troubling sign for Boeing, which has not seen customers divert orders to Airbus en masse.

A small number of airlines have threatened to cancel 737 Max orders since crashes off the coast of Indonesia and in Ethiopia killed 346 people. The Max has been grounded since March.

Officials with Indonesia's Garuda said in March that they were canceling the remaining 49 of a 50-jet Max order. Published reports suggest the airline and Boeing are in talks, however, and Boeing still lists the last 49 Garuda orders on its website.

Similarly, the owner of Lion Air—the Indonesia airline whose Max jet was involved in the first fatal crash in October—vowed to cancel. Boeing still lists the airline's 187 unfilled orders as active.

Middle Eastern carriers Flydubai and Oman Air have threatened to switch to Airbus.

Flyadeal did not mention Boeing in its weekend announcement and did not disclose financial terms of the Airbus order, although the list price of the planes is about $5.5 billion. Carriers rarely pay list prices.

Flyadeal said the Airbus agreement emerged from last month's Paris Air Show.

A Boeing spokesman said Monday that the company does not discuss customer decisions.

Boeing got a boost at the Paris Air Show when the parent company of British Airways and Spain's Iberia said it intends to buy another 200 Max planes. The CEO of International Airlines Group, Willie Walsh, said he was confident the plane would make a successful return.

Boeing disclosed in April that it has booked about $1 billion in charges related to fixing the plane. Analysts expect that to rise sharply.

Dozens of lawsuits have been filed by families of those aboard the downed planes. Boeing will likely have to compensate airlines that already own Max planes—nearly 400 around the world—which are not expected to be allowed in back into the air any time soon.

The company suspended deliveries of new planes in March but has kept the assembly line open at a reduced production rate.

Though other planes have overcome passenger fears about safety, it is uncertain how passengers will feel about getting back on board a Max. Various surveys have indicated passenger reluctance.

Preliminary investigations in Indonesia and Ethiopia point to new software that pushed down the nose of planes in response to faulty readings by a single sensor on each plane. Boeing is making the software less powerful and connecting it to a second sensor, but engineers have encountered setbacks.

Pilots with the Federal Aviation Administration discovered a new flaw last month while testing updated software in a flight simulator, pushed back Boeing's timetable. It now hopes to submit a final application to the FAA in September.

Boeing marketed the Max as an aircraft with more seats and lower operating costs than the Airbus neo. Boeing still has more than 4,500 unfilled orders for the Max. Customers, including three of the four largest U.S. airlines, have given no hint that they plan to nix orders from Boeing.

Boeing announced in December—six weeks after the first crash—that flyadeal had agreed to buy 30 planes with options for 20 more in a transaction valued at up to $5.9 billion. That figure did not include steep discounts typically given to carriers.

On Monday, the Chicago company said that it is proud of its long partnership with Saudi Arabia's aviation industry.

""We wish the flyadeal team well as it builds out its operations,"" Boeing said. ""Our team continues to focus on safely returning the 737 Max to service and resuming deliveries of Max airplanes.""

Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg has apologized for the loss of lives and vowed to make the plane safer. Last week, Boeing announced an ""initial investment"" of $100 million over several years to help families and communities affected by the crashes. That fund is unrelated to any potential losses from lawsuits filed by the families of victims.

Boeing shares fell almost 2% Monday.

While the company's stock is still up more than 8% this year, shares have dropped more than 20% from their peak in early March, shortly before the second deadly accident involving a Max.

Airbus is prime contractor for ESA’s first large mission of its Cosmic Vision programme

@AirbusSpace @esascience @JUICEmission #Jupiter #Ganymede #Callisto

Madrid, 25 July 2019 – Airbus Defence and Space has completed the first step in the construction of the inner structure of the European Space Agency’s (ESA) JUICE satellite. This is the beginning of its Earthly journey through different Airbus sites in Europe (Lampoldshausen, Friedrichshafen and Toulouse) towards final integration.

Airbus is building the JUICE (JUpiter ICy moons Explorer) spacecraft for ESA, which will investigate the potential for Jupiter’s icy moons Europa, Callisto and Ganymede to harbour habitable environments such as subsurface oceans. JUICE will also carry out observations of Jupiter, its atmosphere, magnetosphere, other satellites and rings. As prime contractor, Airbus is leading a consortium of more than 60 companies across Europe on the project.

The inner structure or SSTS (Structure, Shielding and Thermal control Subsystem), built at the Madrid-Barajas site of Airbus, is carbon fibre and is composed of the central load carrying cylinder, shear panels, two equipment protecting Vaults, the Thermal Control System which includes a heat pipes network and multilayer insulation, and secondary elements such as 13 additive manufacturing brackets. This key element weighs 580 kg and will support the satellite’s weight of 5,300 kg (of which about 3,000kg is chemical propellant). Jupiter’s distance from the Sun will make it challenging to generate energy. For this reason the spacecraft is equipped with solar arrays with a total surface of 85 m², the largest ever built for any interplanetary spacecraft.

In May 2022, JUICE will begin a 7 year cruise to Jupiter, travelling more than 600 million kilometres through space, to carry out its three and a half year mission at the Jovian system.

Airbus brings a SMILE to ESA - Airbus,"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wNy1haXJidXMtYnJpbmdzLWEtc21pbGUtdG8tZXNh0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European-Chinese satellite will study the interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere

Madrid, 30 July 2019 – Airbus has been selected by the European Space Agency to build the European component of the SMILE satellite (Solar wind Magnetosphere Ionosphere Link Explorer). SMILE will be the first joint satellite mission between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), following on from the success of the Double Star / Tan Ce mission which flew between 2003 and 2008.



The objective of SMILE is to study and understand space weather. Specifically, it will look at the physics behind continuous interaction between particles in the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere, the magnetic shield that protects the existence of life in our planet.

The mission is now entering a four year period of manufacturing, testing, and integration of the payload module and the platform. In launch configuration these two components will form a 3.15-m-high stack.

The spacecraft will have a mass of 2,200 kg and will travel in a highly elliptical orbit around the Earth. Its perigee will be at a distance of 5,000 km (from where it will download data to the Troll ground station in Antarctica and the CAS ground station in Sanya, China), while the apogee will be as far as 121,000 km (this is almost one third the distance to the Moon). At this vantage point the satellite will have a prolonged view of the Earth's northern polar regions, to enable the boundary of the Earth's magnetic field and the Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, to be imaged.

The payload module will be built at the Airbus site in Madrid, where the instruments will be integrated. The platform will be built in Shanghai. Both, the payload module and the platform will be integrated and tested at ESA’s European Space Research and Technology Centre facilities by a multinational team.

The science payload consists of four instruments. The Soft X-ray Imager will obtain unique measurements of the regions where the solar wind impacts the magnetosphere. The Ultra-Violet Imager will study the global distribution of the auroras. The Light Ion Analyser will measure the energetic particles in the solar wind. And finally the Magnetometer will assess changes in the local magnetic field.

“Today, we are able to predict the weather on Earth, now it’s SMILE’s turn to help us understand space weather around the Earth and who knows…, probably one day, we will have enough data to be able to forecast dangerous solar storms that could disrupt our systems in space and on the ground,” said Fernando Varela, Head of Airbus Space Systems in Spain. “We thank the Spanish Administration for their decisive and continued support to scientific missions.”

Other ESA missions, built by Airbus, such as Cluster which studied the Earth’s magnetosphere, and SOHO which studied the Sun, have already improved understanding of space weather.

Under the current plans, the spacecraft will be launched by a European Vega-C or Ariane 62 rocket in 2023.

ESA accepted a joint proposal from Airbus and French rocket manufacturer, Safran, for which the two companies formed Airbus Safran Launchers, later called the ArianeGroup.

One of the aerospace giant’s subsidiaries, Airbus Defense and Space, was contracted to be the major parts supplier for the Ariane 6. In turn, Airbus Defense and Space subcontracted some of the rocket component production to the Dutch company Spacetec BV.

The Ariane 6 project uses a top-down pricing model, which requires suppliers to agree to maximum prices for projects. The ArianeGroup agreement included strict price controls and deadlines for the completion of components. Failure to meet them could result in substantial fines for Airbus. In turn, Airbus required the same of its suppliers.

Spacetec outsourced the manufacturing of some of the components to its sister company, PM Aerotec. Both companies are owned by the same holding group, PM. In this agreement, however, Spacetec didn’t require the same strict controls.

PM Aerotec had cost overruns in the project and demanded 1.2 million extra euros, more than double the original agreed price.

In turn, Spacetec demanded that Airbus pay the extra costs. When it refused, citing the terms of the contract, Spacetec refused to handover completed parts.

Concerned about the components, Airbus had them seized and stored at the Nederlands Taxatie en Adviesbureau, an independent appraisal agency. Airbus also canceled its contract with Spacetec and the dispute went to court.

A court in Almelo, a town in the eastern part of the Netherlands, heard arguments in the case on June 18. In its filing, Airbus claimed Joep Henk Lüth, the CEO of the holding group PM, is known for his “emotional and unpredictable way of doing business” and described the case as “pure blackmail.”

Airbus also claimed it was unaware that Spacetec’s manufacturing had been subcontracted.

The court ruled in favor of Airbus on Wednesday, finding that the “contract between Airbus and Spacetec is clear in terms of ownership and right of retention.”

Spacetec was ordered handover any remaining parts and pay Airbus’ legal fees.

In response to the ruling, Airbus said in a statement, “For decades, Airbus Defence and Space Netherlands has been working with thousands of partners and suppliers for the development of high-tech space products, also with good results for the production of the engine frames for the new European Ariane 6 launcher.”

Airbus also said the production of the Ariane 6 launcher was on schedule.

Spacetec and PM did not respond Wednesday to requests for comment.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999072790145874}",neutral,0.999072790145874,0
Airbus and OCCAR sign new A400M Global Support contract - Airbus,"Mon, 01 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wNy1haXJidXMtYW5kLW9jY2FyLXNpZ24tbmV3LWE0MDBtLWdsb2JhbC1zdXBwb3J0LWNvbnRyYWN00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Madrid, 01 July 2019 - Airbus has signed the new A400M Global Support Step 2 contract with OCCAR (Organisation for Joint Armament Co-operation), which manages the multinational programme on behalf of the Launch Customer Nations Germany, France, United Kingdom, Spain, Turkey, Belgium and Luxembourg. This is the first support contract for all A400M participating states and it replaces the Global Support agreement Step 1 signed in 2016, which provided support services for France, Spain and the UK.

The contract will bring the benefits of a fully integrated suite of common services using shared resources and assets. It provides a full range of tailored services to meet the needs of the A400M customers, from ground support to airworthiness and from maintenance to material support.

This performance-based contract creates a new partnership framework, based on pooling and sharing, where industry and operators have the opportunity to explore new areas of collaboration, concepts and services. The modular structure of the services allows for the tailoring of solutions as per specific operational requirements.

The pooling and sharing under Airbus management will allow the A400M customers to benefit from significant savings while keeping the same highest standard of services.

This new phase of the A400M Global Support contract provides a support services package to a wider number of nations operating the A400M until the end of 2023. After France, UK and Spain, which were part of the first phase, now Turkey, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg have joined as well.

Alberto Gutiérrez, Head of Military Aircraft at Airbus Defence and Space, said: “With this services contract, we are working together with our customers on innovative solutions never performed before on a military programme. After the agreement with the launch customer nations on the programme’s contract amendment this is another clear signal that through mutual collaboration we are strengthening the future of the A400M.”

Gary Palmer, OCCAR A400M Programme Manager, said: “The A400M Global Support contract covers more than 40 individual services working together, a complete pool of services from ground support to airworthiness, through to maintenance or material services. Under this collaborative model, the more nations that join the pool, the more efficient the services become from which customers can benefit.”

This week Air France announced that it will retire its fleet of Airbus A380 double deckers by 2022 instead of making a significant investment to update them. The carrier said that it will now focus its long haul fleet growth on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A350.

In a statement, the airline said: ""The current competitive environment limits the markets in which the A380 can profitably operate. With four engines, the A380 consumes 20-25% more fuel per seat than new generation long-haul aircraft, and therefore emits more CO2. Increasing aircraft maintenance costs, as well as necessary cabin refurbishments to meet customer expectations reduce the economic attractiveness of Air France's A380s even further. Keeping this aircraft in the fleet would involve significant costs, while the aircraft program was suspended by Airbus earlier in 2019.""

The Air France A380 has nine first class seats, 80 business class seats, 38 in premium economy and 389 in regular economy. Among frequent travelers, Air France's A380 fell out of favor when the carrier failed to update its old-school angled business class seats with a true lie-flat version. The airline had to discount its business class seats to be able to compete with airlines offering the more comfortable 180-degree lie-flat option.

Airbus sees electric backup system as silver bullet - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLXNlZXMtZWxlY3RyaWMtYmFja3VwLXN5c3RlbS1hcy1zaWx2ZXItYnVsbGV0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The electric backup system (EBS) Airbus Helicopters is studying could bring benefits in safety, payload and noise footprint for single-engine helicopters, said Tomasz Krysinski, the company’s vice president of research and innovation.

The manufacturer is planning on demonstrating the use of the EBS, which it describes as a “hybrid propulsion system,” on an H130 light single in 2020.

The EBS would be based on a 100 kW motor and 1 kWh lithium-ion batteries. Under a parallel hybrid architecture, the motor will be connected to the main gearbox. The EBS will thus be able to power the rotor for about 30 seconds.

The main improvement from an EBS, as shown in flight on a modified AS350 AStar in 2011, would be seen in case of an engine failure.

The system would not be powerful enough to act as a second engine. But it would make autorotation safer by maintaining the rotor’s rotation speed constant. The pilot would have more time to react. He would not have to push the collective stick within a critical couple of seconds.

The EBS would then provide some power at flare, making that final landing phase easier.

The technical demonstration eight years ago was successful. However, due to the weight of the system, which was cutting the payload by an unspecified but significant proportion, no business case could be found.

Key in the current project is the swift progress electric devices have made. This is the case for the motors Thales will supply, at 5 kW/kg (2.3 kW/lb.), Krysinski noted. The batteries Airbus Defence & Space will provide will have better energy density, by a factor of two, than the ones used in 2011.

As a result, the system is expected to weigh 75 kg (165 lb.), said Krysinski.

But the second source of power will be harnessed to increase the certified payload. Thanks to the electric 100 kW, the same flight envelope (defined in altitude and speed) can be used with a greater maximum takeoff weight. In case of engine failure, the EBS will help keep the helicopter in the certified flight envelope.

Its power will enable carrying 150 kg (330 lb.) on top of the existing maximum take-off weight, said Krysinski. This will translate into a 75 kg payload improvement (as the system itself weighs 75 kg).

The third benefit of the EBS will make a helicopter a better neighbor, according to Krysinski.

Blade tip speed creates the most annoying contribution to the rotorcraft’s external noise. One could imagine slowing down the rotor to cut that noise, when only part of the rotor’s maximum lift is needed. This is not usually done because, in case of an emergency situation, the pilot would need to accelerate back to the rotor’s nominal speed very quickly. This would be incompatible with the inertia of a turbine engine.

On the contrary, the responsiveness of an electric motor will allow reduced rotor speed operations in an urban environment, Krysinski said.

The EBS is now at technology readiness level (TRL) 4, which means it is a research project. The project is being jointly funded by Airbus Helicopters and the French civil aviation authorities (DGAC). Airbus intends, thanks to two to three months of flight testing next year, to reach TRL 6 – the required level to launch the development of a product.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9641097187995911}",positive,0.9641097187995911,1

Saudi airline goes all in on Airbus as Boeing struggles to get 737 Max back in the air - CNN,"Sun, 07 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAxOS8wNy8wNy9idXNpbmVzcy9ib2VpbmctNzM3LW1heC1mbHlhZGVhbC1haXJidXMvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBSmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMTkvMDcvMDcvYnVzaW5lc3MvYm9laW5nLTczNy1tYXgtZmx5YWRlYWwtYWlyYnVz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New York CNN Business —

Saudi Arabian airline flyadeal said on Sunday that it will fly an all-Airbus fleet, changing course from a plan to buy up to 50 of Boeing’s embattled 737 Max planes.

The move is another blow to Boeing, which has struggled to regain trust after its 737 Max jets were involved in two fatal crashes. The planes have been grounded worldwide, deliveries of the plane have halted, airlines have said they will demand compensation, and in March the plane maker lost a major order because of the tragedies.

Flyadeal didn’t mention Boeing or the crashes in its statement on Sunday, saying that it was announcing a “a significant growth to its fleet” with an order of up to 50 A320 Neo airplanes from Boeing’s rival, Airbus (EADSF). Flyadeal said the deal was struck between its parent company, Saudi Arabian Airlines Corporation, and Airbus (EADSF) during the Paris Air Show in June.

“This order will result in flyadeal operating an all- Airbus A320 fleet in the future,” the statement continued. Flyadeal could not immediately be reached for further comment.

The announcement marks a departure from an earlier plan. In December, Boeing and flyadeal announced that the Saudi airliner had committed to buying between 30 to 50 737 Max jets in a deal that could be worth up to $5.9 billion at list price.

“We wish the flyadeal team well as it builds out its operations,” a Boeing (BA) spokesperson said on Sunday adding that “our team continues to focus on safely returning the 737 MAX to service and resuming deliveries of MAX airplanes.”

Earlier this year, Indonesian airline Garuda canceled a multibillion-dollar order for 737 Max 8 jets. “Our passengers have lost confidence to fly with the Max 8,” Garuda spokesperson Ikhsan Rosan told CNN in March.

It’s not clear when the grounded passenger jets will start flying again, but it’s likely that Boeing’s crisis will extend into next year.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.8079984784126282}",negative,0.8079984784126282,-1

Estimated reading time 6 minutes, 20 seconds.

Airbus has unveiled a conceptual design for a new airliner that pushes the boundaries of technology and innovation with its bird-like appearance, created to inspire a new generation of aeronautical engineers.

Dubbed the ‘Bird of Prey’ due to wing and tail structures which mimic those of an eagle or falcon, it features individually controlled feathers providing active flight control. The split tail enables fine control while the lack of a vertical tail significantly reduces drag. Among the other biomimicry features are a blended wing to fuselage joint mirroring the graceful and aerodynamic arch of a bird of prey.

Signposting the exciting direction of design within the U.K.’s world-class aerospace industry, the ‘Bird of Prey’ has been launched on the opening day of the Royal International Air Tattoo at RAF Fairford by Dr. Liam Fox MP, the Secretary of State for International Trade: “The U.K. is a pioneer of aerospace and engineering; today half the world flies on U.K.-designed and built aircraft wings. The Bird of Prey concept aircraft, supported by the Government’s Great Britain campaign, gives an exciting glimpse into the future of the sector — ground-breaking, fuel efficient and immensely innovative — demonstrating the strength and creativity of British engineering.”

The Bird of Prey is not intended to represent an actual aircraft concept; its primary purpose is to inspire young engineers. However, the concept is grounded in reality and gives an insight into what a future regional aircraft could look like. It is an extrapolation of what could be done with technologies that currently form the basis of research within Airbus, such as hybrid-electric propulsion to reduce atmospheric emissions, active control systems and advanced composite structures.

We need a new type of engineering and a new breed of engineers and Airbus wants the Bird of Prey to show the younger generation that engineering is entering an exciting new era and that they can make a difference.

Bird of Prey also highlights the U.K.’s high value design credentials, which are fundamental to the nation reinforcing its position as a global leader of innovation and engineering excellence capable of delivering innovative products that keep the industry at the forefront of aerospace technology.

The U.K. is unique in having widespread presence in advanced engineering and a thriving digital sector. Bringing those together with the imagination of a younger generation is intended to give the U.K. a lead in the global re-engineering of engineering itself.

“Bird of Prey is designed to be an inspiration to young people and create a “wow” factor that will help them consider an exciting career in the UK’s crucially-important aerospace sector. One of the priorities for the entire industry is how to make aviation more sustainable — making flying cleaner, greener and quieter than ever before. We know from our work on the Airbus A350 passenger jet that biomimicry, literally learning from the genetics of animals, that nature has some of the best lessons we can learn about design. Who can’t help but be inspired by such a creation,” said Martin Aston, senior manager at Airbus.

“Birds in flight have captured the imagination for centuries. The very first engineers looked to nature to work out how to emulate flight, and now the Airbus Bird of Prey concept will play an important role in inspiring the engineers of tomorrow. It is essential that we spark fascination and excitement in the coming generations to attract them towards pioneering sustainable advances for the future of aviation,” explained Sir Brian Burridge, chief executive of the Royal Aeronautical Society.

“This Airbus concept illustrates the creative potential in aerospace to exploit radically new technologies and design ideas. If we are to incorporate these ideas into future products, we will need to develop new and better design capabilities that are able to explore beyond the current design paradigm, validate complex solutions and radically reduce the cost of development,” added James McMicking, chief strategy officer at the Aerospace Technology Institute.

Nick West, chief executive of the Air League, said: “The Air League believes that the Airbus Bird of Prey concept is a great way to capture the imagination and inspire young people to develop a career interest in engineering, aerospace and aviation. The project brings together many aspects of aerodynamics, aero structures, advanced propulsion systems and design which encapsulate the pioneering spirit of Airbus.”

“The IET aims to inspire the next generation of engineers and help to plug the nationwide engineering skills shortage. More than 200,000 people with engineering skills are required each year to meet demand in the next five years and it is estimated that there will be an annual shortfall of close to 60,000 engineers and technicians to fill these roles. The importance of high value design — applying advanced engineering to translate an idea from an initial concept into a commercial product — to the U.K.’s economy cannot be underestimated. We’re delighted to endorse this Airbus project, promoting the importance of HVD and we hope the Bird of Prey prototype helps to inspire our next generation to choose engineering careers and meet the demand for skills,” said Nigel Fine, chief executive at the Institution of Engineering and Technology.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8586163520812988}",neutral,0.8586163520812988,0

Now, 50 years after the initial crewed lunar landing – and 47 since the last – mankind is preparing to visit its closest neighbour in space again.



Under its Artemis programme, the U.S. space agency NASA is planning a Moon landing as early as 2024. Europe and Airbus are playing a major role in this ambitious project: Orion is the spacecraft that will send humans into space, and the European Service Module (ESM) – for which Airbus is the prime development and manufacturing contractor – is Europe’s contribution to the space capsule. It provides propulsion, power, water, oxygen and nitrogen as well as keeps the spacecraft at the right temperature and on course.

The initial module was delivered to NASA in November 2018; the second is under construction in the Airbus clean rooms. The first Orion flight – an unmanned test flight – is expected to lead far beyond the moon and return to Earth in 2020.

Airbus and the Gateway outpost

To enable lunar exploration NASA plans a Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway, a moon-orbiting space station that would extend humanity's presence in space as well as provide a platform for scientific experiments. NASA will also use the outpost to access the Moon.



The European Space Agency (ESA) is planning to participate in the Gateway project, with a living and research module as well as an infrastructure module for the later expansion – awarding Airbus a study contract for both. In the first study, Airbus in Bremen, Germany is developing a concept for an international living and research module. In the second, the company’s Toulouse, France site is designing a concept for an infrastructure element for refuelling, docking and telecommunications, which will also act as a lock for scientific equipment.

Moon Cruiser

Airbus’ Moon Cruiser concept

Conducting lunar missions, including the Gateway construction, will be a complex task for the international community that requires a well-planned chain of supply and logistics missions. Airbus' Moon Cruiser concept can support both the development of the Gateway and subsequent lunar missions, playing a role in logistics, transporting cargo or fuel to the lunar orbit and Gateway for refuelling.



The Moon Cruiser will be compatible with the new Ariane 6 launcher – developed by ArianeGroup, the joint venture between Airbus and Safran – enabling various modules to be sent to the Gateway, as well as transferring a large module into low lunar orbit.

International Space Station: enabling future Moon missions

For some 20 years, mankind has been living and working aboard the International Space Station (ISS) and its Columbus space laboratory – built by Airbus – is ESA’s largest single contribution to the ISS, as well as the first permanent European research facility in space.



The successful continuation of the ISS operation is important for future research, as important technologies can be tested there before being used for a long journey to the Moon. For example, an innovative and efficient life-support system built by Airbus in Friedrichshafen, Germany – indispensable for astronauts' journeys to the Moon or beyond – is currently being tested on the ISS.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999936819076538}",neutral,0.9999936819076538,0
"Airbus changes tack on seat comfort, posits 'sub-economy' on A350 - Runway Girl Network","Mon, 08 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTkvMDcvYWlyYnVzLWNoYW5nZXMtdGFjay1vbi1zZWF0LWNvbWZvcnQtcG9zaXRzLXN1Yi1lY29ub215LW9uLWEzNTAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When a major aircraft manufacturer has a series of senior executive changes, its strategy can be expected to change too. Airbus, which has a new chief executive and chief commercial officer, among other positions, is no exception. Either in conjunction with this change or as a coincidence, Airbus’ strategy to market its aircraft as having comfortable seats has been the subject of a remarkably strong U-turn.

Chief commercial officer Christian Scherer asserted just prior to the Paris Air Show that Airbus can offer 17”-wide seats in a ten-abreast A350. Not only is this a full 0.6” more than the 16.4” that Airbus sold years ago, but in the absence of some very creative rounding up of numbers it seems very unlikely to be achievable without deal-breaking compromises on comfort.

Quite the pivot from Airbus, which was selling the notion of a ‘comfort standard’ less than six years ago. #paxex #avgeek https://t.co/pAGnL5lfWY — Mary Kirby (@MaryBKirby) June 15, 2019

Doubling down on this Airbus messaging was senior vice president for marketing François Caudron, who sat down for an extensive interview with RGN at Le Bourget.

On the A350, Caudron says Scherer “is right when he says that ten-abreast is comfortable. It’s as comfortable as what you currently fly in the 300ER, that’s what it is, from a seat perspective. Ten-abreast already flies on 350. Air Caraïbes, French Bee, these guys fly it.”

Fundamentally, the comparative comfort of the 9.5-inch wider Boeing 777 and the 9.5-inch narrower A350 with the same number of seats cannot be objectively the same. Despite ongoing requests, Airbus has not provided Runway Girl Network with any documentation that might explain how the “24cm gap” between the fuselage size of the A350 and the 777 can be discounted.

In fairness to Caudron, who makes the point that passengers of the two leisure-focused, low-cost airlines from France’s Groupe Dubreuil are satisfied, both the airlines he mentions are clear about their value propositions: cheap flights and minimal comfort as the basic offering. French Bee and Air Caraïbes also both offer relatively low-priced options for passengers wanting to upgrade out of their tightest economy seats.

“I expect that the longhaul, low-cost, the leisure travelers, that matches their market,” Caudron says, and then drops something of a bombshell about ten-abreast A350 seats.

“We can sense, for the last year-and-a-half, that some of the mainline carriers are more interested than they were before, because they are really under pressure from the longhaul, low-cost,” Caudron notes. “The market is evolving, right? So it’s up to them to decide: do we want to compete against the longhaul [low-cost airlines]?”

It would seem that Caudron means competing on the simple basis of cost, rather than on passenger experience and the increased value side of the value-for-money equation.

As for airlines, Caudron says, “some of them are very clear: no, we are not in that market. Fine if they [the LHLCCs] attract some of our pax into their long-haul, low-cost business. Some of them say we may want to have a cabin portion, just to have a product that allows us to compete with the long-haul, low-cost. And then I’m seeing in the mainline carriers, this is what we’re going to be seeing. The back of the cabin, or it’s a part of the economy cabin, ten-abreast, and then a nine-abreast, and then a premium economy, and then business.”

This could be something further along the lines of what American Airlines tried with its Boeing 777-300ER in its initial configuration: a ten-abreast Main Cabin economy, but with its extra-legroom Main Cabin Extra economy seats in the nine-abreast layout.

Caudron is cautious that the true trend is not yet clear. “We’ll see. Maybe some of them will opt for a full ten-abreast. I think it’s more likely that they will go for an additional cabin segmentation. Because that has the benefit of giving them, basically, configuration where they can fight on fares with very low service, and better up-sell the nine-abreast.”

This sort of ‘sub-economy’ segmentation would create a fourth class of economy travel, behind premium economy, extra-legroom economy, and the present entry-level economy class.

It creates all sorts of questions for airlines, far beyond the ‘basic economy’ trend started by the US carriers that has been filtering across the world as fuller service airlines look to compete with their long-haul, low-cost rivals. Basic economy seats currently sit in the entry-class economy travel, and the strategy has been successful both in allowing airlines to display cut-price lead-in fares and, crucially, to reduce the friction of purchasing ancillary products: if a passenger is willing to pay a bit more to upgrade themselves out of the current worst experience, they are in theory more likely to also be willing to add additional items to their online shopping cart.

But the global distribution system (GDS) flight search and ticket sales networks are set up only to compare four classes at present: first, business, premium economy and regular economy. Basic economy falls into the latter category, as indeed does the existing ultra-narrow economy from airlines such as Air Transat or AirAsia X. The argument for further GDS segmentation would therefore be further raised, but with that Pandora’s Box comes a wealth of other problems.

Nearly two years ago, this RGN journalist wrote a much-discussed column highlighting the binary economy seating choices that Airbus and Boeing offer to airlines:

A: relatively wide

B: relatively comfortable

C: uncomfortably narrow

D: ultra-narrow

The previous Airbus marketing strategy was offering airlines a choice between A and D. Now, it seems, they’re offering both — on the same airplane.

JetBlue Airways recently received unwelcome news from Airbus: its planes are delayed.

The New York-based airline on Tuesday more than halved its expected deliveries of new Airbus A321neo planes this year to no more than six from 13 as delays hit the European manufacturer.

""We're very disappointed with the continued delays to our A321neo program as a result of the Airbus production issues including a further delay that we've received in the last 1.5 weeks,"" JetBlue's CEO, Robin Hayes, told analysts on a call after reporting higher-than-expected profits for the second quarter.

Those delays will shave about 2 percentage points off of JetBlue's growth plans for next year, the carrier said in a filing. Flying without those fuel-efficient planes could also drive up costs, it added. The airline plans to expand its capacity by 3% to 5% in the third quarter ""which is unusually low for JetBlue,"" President and COO Joanna Geraghty said.

Airbus did not immediately return a request for comment.

The delivery problems show constraints on airlines that don't even fly the Boeing 737 Max, which has been grounded worldwide after two fatal crashes, are facing as they scramble to meet strong demand.

JetBlue's competitors, including United , Southwest and American , are all challenged by the grounding of the 737 Max, another fuel-efficient narrow-body plane that competes directly with Airbus' A320 family of planes. Those airlines have canceled thousands of flights through November, and regulators have not said when the planes will be cleared to fly again.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9996466636657715}",negative,0.9996466636657715,-1

Dubai, United Arab Emirates – A Saudi budget airline is ordering 30 Airbus planes in a deal that replaces a $6 billion agreement it had with Boeing for its troubled 737 Max jets, which have been grounded after two deadly crashes.

It’s the latest blow to Boeing as it struggles to win back the public’s trust after 346 people died in crashes involving the Max jet: a Lion Air flight that went down off the coast of Indonesia and an Ethiopian Airlines crash.

Nearly 400 Max jets around the world remain grounded since mid-March with airlines unable to use the planes until regulators clear them to fly again.

Flyadeal, a subsidiary of Saudi Arabian Airlines Corp., said Monday that its order means its fleet will consist of only Airbus A320s. It said the deal with the European plane maker includes options for a further 20 A320 Neo planes.

The statement did not name Boeing and did not disclose details of the cost, only saying it follows from an agreement signed during the Paris Air Show last month between Airbus and flyadeal’s parent company.

Boeing, meanwhile, faces dozens of lawsuits over the crashes of its 737 Max. Preliminary investigations point to the role played by new software that pushed the planes’ noses down.

The Chicago-based company said in a statement to The Associated Press on Monday that it does not comment on customer discussions. Rather, Boeing said it is proud of its long partnership with Saudi Arabia’s aviation industry.

“We wish the flyadeal team well as it builds out its operations,” Boeing said. “Our team continues to focus on safely returning the 737 Max to service and resuming deliveries of Max airplanes.”

In December 2018, Boeing had struck an agreement with flayadeal for 30 of the 737 Max jets with the option to purchase 20 more in a deal valued up to $5.9 billion at list price. At the time, Boeing said flyadeal had conducted an evaluation for 50 narrow-body airplanes and had selected the 737 Max for the future.

The 737 Max, which promised more seats and lower operating costs than its Airbus competitor, was Boeing’s fastest-selling airplane, accumulating more than 4,800 orders worldwide.

In April, Boeing reported a $1 billion charge against earnings because of higher production costs for the Max. Analysts expect more charges will follow, including compensation for families and for airlines that have lost the use of the planes until regulators clear them to fly again.

Boeing has apologized for the loss of lives and recently announced an “initial investment” of $100 million over several years to help families and communities affected by the crashes.

Lawyers who are suing Boeing on behalf of passengers’ families discounted the amount and said the $100 million won’t stop them from demanding that Boeing provide details about how the plane and its flight-control software were developed","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9960052371025085}",neutral,0.9960052371025085,0

However, the 1m (3ft)-long model, dubbed Bird of Prey, is unlikely to give too much away about the airframer's future developments in the commercial arena. It is ""not intended to represent an actual aircraft concept"". Instead, its purpose is to ""inspire a new generation of aeronautical engineers"", says Airbus, which displayed the model at the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT) on 19 July.

Airbus

The 810nm (1,500km)-range aircraft, which includes four counter-rotating propellers and an all-composite airframe, is a collaboration between Filton, UK-based engineers and the chief technology officer's research and development team in Toulouse, and will feature on posters as part of the UK government’s ""Engineering is Great Britain and Northern Ireland"" inward investment campaign.

The model was unveiled at RIAT by Liam Fox, secretary of state for international trade, who said that the industry in the UK needed an influx of young engineers to maintain its commercial advantage. ""Aerospace in the UK is a £40 billion [$50 billion] sector, with 90% of what it produces exported,"" he said.

According to Mark Bentall, Airbus chief operating officer for the corporate technology office, several of Bird of Prey's features do have connections with ongoing research and technology programmes. ""While a feathered design may not be what we end up with, wing-tip design and flight controls are a huge area for us, as are composites and hybrid electric,"" he says.

""We could have come up with a complete Thunderbird, but there is some grounding of reality in this, and the question is how far we take some of these ideas.""

CHICAGO — Saudi Arabian budget carrier Flyadeal reversed a commitment to buy as many as 50 Boeing Co. 737 Max jets, becoming the first airline to officially drop the plane since its grounding following two deadly crashes.

Flyadeal will operate an entirely Airbus fleet, the company said Sunday in a statement, buying as many as 50 A320neo-family planes from Boeing’s European rival.

The Airbus order was booked last month at the Paris Air Show by the discounter’s parent, Saudi Arabian Airlines. That announcement had sparked speculation about whether the planes would be allocated to Flyadeal, which had said in December it would spend up to $5.9 billion on Boeing Max jets.

“We understand that Flyadeal will not finalize its commitment to the 737 Max at this time given the airline’s schedule requirements,” Boeing said Sunday in an email. “We wish the Flyadeal team well and hope we can support their fleet and operational needs in the future.”

Boeing fell as much as 1.6% Monday in New York. The shares were down 0.9% to $352.70 at 9:37 a.m. local time.

Flyadeal will take delivery starting in 2021 of 30 Airbus A320neo aircraft, with an option for a further 20 planes from the same family of single-aisle jets.

The decision marks a commercial setback for Boeing, which is under pressure to prove the Max is safe and get it flying again after two disasters five months apart killed a combined 346 people. The narrow-body workhorse has been grounded globally since March.

The uncertainty surrounding the return of the Max to the skies has prompted carriers to amend aircraft orders. Virgin Australia has pushed back delivery of its first 737 Max jets by almost two years. PT Garuda Indonesia and VietJet Aviation are among the carriers that have also weighed changes in the aftermath of the fatal crashes.

Carriers around the globe are having to redeploy or lease planes, while delaying the retirement of older ones, as Boeing works on a fix for the jet. Emirates, the world’s largest long-haul carrier, has started using Airbus SE A380 superjumbos onto its shortest routes to replace lost capacity after sister carrier FlyDubai reduced services following the idling of its 14-strong Max fleet.

Europe’s aviation regulator has outlined five major requirements it wants Boeing to address before it will allow the 737 Max to return to service, a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg last week. One of them related to a previously unknown concern about the jet’s autopilot function.

Boeing won Flyadeal as a customer in December when the airline committed to buying 30 737 Max aircraft with an option for another 20. The deal, while subject to final terms and conditions, was considered a major victory for Boeing at the time, given Flyadeal has operated an Airbus fleet.

But the airline began to waver following a second fatal crash involving the plane. If the process of finding a fix for the safety problems took too long, the airline was open to other options, Chief Executive Officer Con Korfiatis told Bloomberg in April.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9987918734550476}",neutral,0.9987918734550476,0

TIM ROBINSON reports on the Airbus ‘Bird of Prey’.

Airbus has revealed a visionary concept from its engineers in Filton for an ultramodern green airliner of the future – one possible outcome of where today’s advanced technology may take us when designers’ imaginations are truly unleashed.

The Bird of Prey is a 80-seater, 1,500km range hybrid-electric regional airliner that incorporates the latest thinking in aerodynamics and flight control, structures and distributed propulsion to create the greenest ever future airliner. Using technology now under development, the Bird of Prey could provide a 30-50% reduction in fuel burn compared to equivalent aircraft today – a major leap in efficiency.

Says Jeremy Greaves FRAeS, Vice President, UK Corporate Affairs and Strategy, Airbus: “This is a visioneering project where we asked our talented flight physicists to imagine what the future could look like.” The Bird of Prey then, is an example of critical High Value Design (HVD) that combines preliminary engineering with creativity to define a product. Explains Martin Aston, Senior Manager, Airbus and project lead for Bird of Prey: “It’s that combination of imagination, innovation and awareness of science, then converting that into a viable product.”

Thought up by Airbus engineers at the UK’s Filton site who were given a brief to imagine the future of flight without any limits, the Bird of Prey was brought to life by a British superyacht and industrial designer – Rob McPherson of BezierLab. McPherson remarked: “When I was approached to see if I’d be interested in creating a vision for a future airliner I jumped at the chance” adding: “The brief was to create a concept which would be technically possible if we pushed ourselves to the limits, but futuristic enough to inspire. It was delightful to be encouraged to think freely and could only be done with such a visionary client!”

The company stresses that the Bird of Prey should not be seen as a firm Airbus programme, “or even as having an entry-into-service date assigned to it.” Says Greaves: “It may not be real in current Airbus strategy or financial planning but it provides a headmark for future inspirations.”

As well as Airbus, the initiative (which includes a large 2.5m wingspan static model to be unveiled at RIAT today) is supported by the UK’s Air League, Aerospace Technology Institute, IET, Whitehall’s ‘Britain is Great’ campaign and the Royal Aeronautical Society. This model will make for an impressive talking point and centrepiece at future aviation events and functions. A ‘Phase 2’ of the initiative, says Airbus, could see this non-flying model transformed into a flying prototype as an exciting student design project for control systems.

Says Aston on the model and Bird of Prey concept: “What we want to do is get people to look at that and say, ‘right, how would I design that’? What technologies would I put on there? How would I make it work? How would I make it? How would I maintain it, how would I make sure that it’s reliable?”

The aviation industry has set itself tough targets to reduce its environmental impact – such as the EU’s Flightpath 2050 – which calls for a reduction in CO 2 by 75%, NO x by 95% and noise by 65% by 2050. Concepts such as Bird of Prey will help turn these aspirations into reality by showing what might be possible and inspiring a new generation of aerospace professionals to dream big.

Biomimicry as a design theme

Biomimicry is not new, but modern materials and technology open up amazing possibilities. (Airbus)

“The birds fly a lot better than we do” observes Leslie Howard as legendary Spitfire designer Reginald J Mitchell in the fictional film ‘First of the Few’, “See how they wheel and bank and glide. Perfect. And all in one: wings, body, tail. All in one. And when we try, we build something all stuck together with strings and struts and wires. But, you wait. Someday, I’m going to build a plane that will move just like a bird.” That aircraft, of course, was the iconic Spitfire, a paradox in being perhaps one of the world’s most beautiful aircraft but built with a deadly purpose.

‘Strings and struts and wires’ may have been replaced today by ‘nacelles, engine pylons and fuselage belly fairings’, but, some 83 years after Spitfire’s first flight, modern design tools, advanced materials, 3D printing, brought together with ‘high value design’ (HVD) may allow tomorrow’s aircraft engineers to pursue Mitchell’s vision of a perfectly streamlined ‘bird-like’ aircraft to its ultimate form for a more peaceful role, the Bird of Prey.

Says industrial designer McPherson: “During the initial meeting at Airbus I was briefed on the technology that was currently being developed and one aspect was biomimicry. The talk was about making wings more flexible/adaptive like a bird's wing. Wing tip ‘feathers’ were discussed which led me to create a couple of concept sketches of a more natural looking wing. I wanted something that would look powerful and purposeful so decided to look at birds of prey for inspiration.”

This is no mere aesthetics but would result in improved aerodynamics by taking cues from nature. An albatross, with wing aspect ratio of 18:1 compared to around 9.5 on an A320 is able to travel 1,000s of kilometres by barely using any energy.

Blending the wing and fuselage in an arch, mirrors how a bird’s body blends into its wings and provides for maximum aerodynamic efficiency. Instead of hinged ailerons or flaps, the Bird of Prey would use highly-efficient wing-tip feathers to ‘morph’ and control its flightpath, as well as shaping the wing for various phases of flight. Control using these active wingtip devices and distributed propulsion would also allow the tail empennage to be reduced in size and weight and radically reimagined into a bird’s tail feathers to provide precision control. No vertical tail, as in the B-2 stealth bomber and various UAVs, would allow for reduced drag and increased aerodynamic efficiency.

As Mitchell’s Spitfire demonstrates, taking ideas from nature is nothing new for aerospace, but todays scientists are constantly discovering new applications of biomimicry. Sharks and whales, for example have rough skin that paradoxically reduces drag in the water. That adaptation has been investigated by Airbus in a series of operational trials using test patches of ‘riblets’ applied to aircraft surfaces. A further development is that these rough drag-reducing skins may be ‘spray painted’ on using today’s automated systems.

Moveable wingtips

Perhaps one of the most radical aspects of the Bird of Prey is in its individual wingtip ‘feathers’ – which combine the drag-reduction function of traditional winglets, seen on many aircraft today, with the control and stability function of a bird’s feathers, replacing traditional ailerons and flaps. Only recently an idea like this might have seemed like science fiction. However, advances in active and passive ‘morphing’ using shape-memory materials has now brought this advanced control system technology, a call-back to the Wright brothers ‘wing-warping’, closer to practical applications.

As well as NASA in the US, the UK is making strides in this field. Earlier this year Airbus revealed that it had flown AlbatrossOne – a sub-scale demonstrator developed by its British Filton engineers which featured a movable hinged wingtip. The ‘semi-aeroelastic hinge’ on the AlbatrossOne allows the wingtips to freely flap – cutting down on turbulence and gusts, while also reducing overall weight. Airbus Filton engineer Tom Wilson explains: “The Airbus demonstrator is the first aircraft to trial in-flight, freely-flapping wing-tips to relieve the effects of wind gusts and turbulence,” adding: “We drew inspiration from nature – the albatross marine bird locks its wings at the shoulder for long-distance soaring but unlocks them when wind-gusts occur or manoeuvring is required.”

“The AlbatrossOne model will explore the benefits of unlockable, freely-flapping wing-tips – accounting for up to a third of the length of the wing – to react autonomously during inflight turbulence and lessen the load on the wing at its base, so reducing the need for heavily reinforced wing boxes.”

Combining these wingtip functions of gust response, drag and load reductions, with roll control functions, as well as locking for long-range cruise, thus brings an aeroplane close to the ultra-aerodynamic efficiency of birds that are able to constantly reshape their wings for different phases of flight. Bird of Prey could be thought of as the ultimate extrapolation of AlbatrossOne.

Hybrid-electric power

E-Fan X prototype, set to fly in 2021, will trial high-power hybrid propulsion technology. (Airbus)

The Bird of Prey would use a next-generation hybrid electric propulsion system for eco-efficient power, driving four A400M-style scimitar-shaped propellers. The benefits of hybrid-electric propulsion is that kerosene-powered engines (whether turbofans or turboprops) can be resized and optimised for the cruise phase of flight, rather than take-off and climb where electric power is added to boost performance. Fuel savings could thus be as much as 30% compared to today’s designs – a massive jump compared to the average 1% that engine manufacturers can squeeze out of turbofan architectures each year.

Airbus is already leading the charge towards hybrid-electric propulsion with its E-Fan X demonstrator which it is set to fly in 2021 with partner Rolls-Royce. That ‘X-Plane’ which will fly with the world’s largest (2MW) airborne turbogenerator as a demonstrator for this large and powerful hybrid-electric system.

Moving to a hybrid-electric propulsion system also allows aircraft designers to decouple the ‘propulsor’ (fan, ducted fan or propeller) from the ‘engine’ (turbogenerator or battery), opening up radical new configurations in distributed propulsion that optimise aerodynamics, increase redundancy and boost fuel efficiency. “We are at the dawn of a new age in aviation” says Rolls-Royce’s Chief Technology Officer, Paul Stein.

While long-haul, twin aisle aircraft will still need to rely on kerosene-powered aircraft, Airbus’ Chief Technology Officer, Grazia Vittadini, notes that the benefits of hybrid-electric power are such that: “It is definitely one of the configurations we are exploring injecting into our core products” when Airbus finally comes to design a replacement for its short-haul A320neo family.

Distributed propulsion

Distributed propulsion could make for a super-quiet STOL regional airliner. (Airbus)

Distributed propulsion, too, may have other benefits. Much like an A400M or C-130J can perform short landings and take-offs using its propellers, so too could a propeller-driven hybrid airliner. This would enable it to operate into smaller airports and airfields. Lower fuel burn would also translate into lower operating costs, lower ticket prices for passengers and thus potentially open up wider networks of regional airports for point-to-point travel.

As well as its incredible fuel efficiency, the Bird of Prey would also be a greener neighbour, as its short-take-off capability would also allow it to climb out steeper, thus reducing the noise footprint on the ground. With distributed power, the propellers, too, could potentially act as yaw controllers, allowing smoother and more stable landings in crosswinds.

Indeed, with distributed hybrid-electric propulsion there may even be ways to ‘tune’ the propellers as a form of ‘active noise control’ to redirect or reduce noise downwards to the ground. Germany’s DLR lab is already investigating this concept for a small regional airliner with distributed propulsion. An ultra-quiet regional airliner would open up the possibility of 24hour operations or increased frequencies at a far wider number of airports.

Finally, a distributed hybrid-electric propulsion system would also provide additional levels of system redundancy and safety. A (highly unlikely) propeller failure on one, two or even three propulsors could just see the system reroute power to the other remaining propellers. Four-engined aircraft (such as the B-17) have landed before on single engines but a distributed propulsion system able to reconfigure and reroute power dynamically as needed would provide far higher margins of safety.

3D printing and geodesics

Geodesics may allow future airliners to dispense with fuselage frames and stringers in favour of organic-looking ultra-lightweight 3D-printed 'skeletons'. (Airbus)

Another advance that could be used on the Bird of Prey is 3D printing and advanced composites to create an ultra-lightweight, almost ‘bird-like’ skeleton and structure in place of traditional fuselage frames, or wing spars and structures. Parts made by additive layer manufacturing (ALM) or 3D printing have the potential to be up to 55% lighter than traditional parts. Already small 3D printed parts are appearing on aircraft such as the Airbus A350 – and these will continue to expand in numbers and applications.

Even more excitingly, as well as using 3D printing to replace existing parts on conventional configuration aircraft, ALM can free designers from thinking about traditional shapes for structures, ushering in a new era of organic-looking aircraft. Airbus has already hinted at future possibilities with its 2050 concept airliner which features a geodetic-style fuselage structure.

Interestingly, the Bird of Prey’s geodesic (or geodetic) structure harks back to another famous aircraft built at Airbus UK’s Broughton site in the 1940s – the Vickers Wellington bomber. Geodetic technology, developed by Barnes Wallis, produced a light but immensely strong and durable structure able to take large amounts of punishment and damage yet still remain airworthy.

Twenty-first century 3D printing and computer design make it feasible that this lattice-work style structure could return in a more elegant form, combining beautiful organic shapes with extreme strength.

The need for high-value design (HVD)

Chinese HVD - a COMAC subscale demonstrator for an efficient airliner with a V-tail. (COMAC)

To help develop an aircraft like the Bird of Prey, the UK needs to refresh and reinvigorate its shrinking HVD pool of talent. It is estimated, for example, that between 1990 and 2015 UK HVD capabilities declined by around 30%. This is a relatively recent development. For the UK, its HVD contribution to Airbus has centred around wings, engines (via Rolls-Royce) and landing gears. Research, begun decades ago with wind tunnels and design tools has allowed Airbus to soar to a position where it commands a duopoly with Boeing.

HVD − or the ability to apply advanced engineering from concept to market, is the ‘noble work’ that truly creates long-term value, growth and jobs in aerospace, rather than sub-system design or ‘build to print manufacture’ where work can be easily shifted around the world to cheaper workers.

Airbus’ Aston explains: “In 1998 the Ford Motor Company produced a study. What they found is that 70% of a product's complete life cycle costs are locked in the preliminary or HVD phase. Which means that if you control that part of the process, you are very, very influential. If we don’t do that, all we do is become a build-to-print nation, take other people’s designs and make them. Whereas if we control the product definition, we control what comes next.”

However, that position (and the UK’s part in it) is not guaranteed. Leaving the politics of Brexit aside, it is clear that the UK has been ‘living on past glories’ where key decisions and research made years ago have allowed Britain to retain its crown as the designer and manufacturer of Airbus wings. The incremental improvements to airliners such as the A320neo and A330neo have resulted in conservative safe design choices, rather than radical configurations. Even the A350 XWB, while sporting elegant winglets, conforms to the ‘dominant configuration’ of tube, wings and engines set in the 1950s by the Boeing 707. Says Aston: “We’ve taken the Wright brothers aeroplane and got it about as far as it’s going to get for now. It now needs the next generation to come along and do something really clever.”

Today though, there are new challenges. The retirement of skilled and experienced aerospace engineers and intense competition from new sectors such as IT or web start-ups have stoked fears of a future skills gap for aerospace engineers. There is also competition from new entrants, such as China, which is innovating at an incredible pace. China, although its new C919 airliner looks highly conventional, is already looking to a future replacement with a potential V-tailed airliner model. It has to be remembered that it was Airbus’ willingness to take risks with a widebody twinjet, composites, a two-person flightdeck and FBW that allowed it to leap-frog over US competitors and see off both Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas as commercial rivals. Stagnating is a sure-fire way to decline. Says Aston of the UK’s position: “We’re on the edge. I think at the moment there is still real excellence in UK engineering, certainly in aerospace. But unless we actually invest in that capability and actually put it ahead of the global competition, we risk going into decline.”

Neglect HVD and the consequences may not just be economic and the gradual decline and slow death of the UK aerospace industry as it fades into irrelevance, but can also prove fatal and result in lives being lost. The current 737 MAX crisis, for example, goes back to a HVD engine-airframe integration challenge where a more complex and expensive (longer landing gear) solution was rejected in favour of what seemed at the time to be a low-risk cheap fix.

The retirement of these engineers, the decline of these HVD skills and increased competition, comes at a critical time for the UK as it wrestles with its place in a post-Brexit world. ‘Disruptive’ technology in the form of 3D printing, hybrid-electric propulsion, AI, self-healing smart materials, VR/AR and digitisation means that tomorrow’s aerospace engineers will require new skills, education and training to be able to harness HVD for the next generation of aircraft – which will require diverse, creative teams to think about the whole design. Tomorrow’s aircraft designers will need to view aircraft as an integrated ‘whole’ rather than systems or subsystems such as wings, fuel or landing gear. For radical configurations like the Bird of Prey, or even nearer term advances such as short-lip engine nacelles, integration between airframers and engine manufacturers will become even closer.

There are bright spots on the horizon; for example, the UK’s Aerospace Technology Institute, the Brunel Challenge, launched earlier this year and the Team Tempest consortium are all working towards a common goal of revitalising and re-energising HVD in the UK where for many years the sector has been content to ‘play it safe’ and focus on its strengths.

The cusp of an aerospace revolution?

One of the early sketches of the Bird of Prey. (Airbus/Rob McPherson)

Although the Bird of Prey may just be CGI and a model at the moment, progress in aviation, particularly in electric/hybrid electric technologies and advanced structures, is now moving faster than many might grasp. The recent Paris Air Show, for example, showed several examples of distributed propulsion which, when combined with hybrid electrics, biomimicry, advanced composites and 3D printing, has the potential to unlock a revolution in eco-efficient flight. Says Aston: “It was engineering excellence that is why we are where we are today. And that’s why, when the next generation of aircraft come through, we want to be in the same position.""

Jeremy Greaves from Airbus UK is optimistic of the possibilities: “Today we can’t say how much of the reality of this ‘visioneering’ will come to fruition but we can say that even if only 20% of ideas come to reality, we will be at the cutting edge of tomorrow’s technology.”

But make no mistake, for those at school, university, or college or just entering the aerospace industry, they are about to enter a new age of aerospace innovation where the sky is literally the limit and over half a century of established textbook wisdom of ‘this is what an airliner should look like’ is set to be thrown out of the window. The next generation of engineers, empowered with new tools, materials and digital savvy are thus set to ‘re-engineer engineering’.

For budding aerospace engineers who dream of designing aeroplanes that fly like a bird – your time has come!

Airbus Pulls Anniversary Book Over Fraud Probe Concerns: Sources - Business Insider,"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXB1bGxzLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LWJvb2stb3Zlci1mcmF1ZC1wcm9iZS1jb25jZXJucy1zb3VyY2VzLTIwMTktN9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus <AIR.PA> has halted sales of a new book that the planemaker had commissioned for its 50th anniversary to avoid hampering the manufacturer's attempts to win a settlement in a bribery probe, two people familiar with the matter said.

The move is the latest sign of tension in Airbus <AIR.PA> as it nears the climax of a roughly $400 million, four-year internal probe carried out in support of an Anglo-French investigation into the use of intermediaries to win jetliner and other deals.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Airbus has already fired more than 100 people over ethics and compliance issues as its probe has progressed.

The book, ""Airbus: The First 50 Years"", written by former New York Times journalist Nicola Clark, charts the rise of Airbus against challenging odds to become a European rival to Boeing and has a chapter focusing on the probe.

Sources said Airbus hoped to present its findings to the UK Serious Fraud Office and France's PNF police by the end of the year. By doing so, they said it would seek more leniency under a system of prosecution agreements that allows for heavy fines rather than charges that might bar it from public contracts.

The two people said Airbus halted the book's sales because it was concerned its official links to the publication could hamper talks with the authorities or discussions over other litigation as it seeks a fresh start under new management.

Airbus confirmed it had decided not to go ahead with the commissioned book, but denied any link to the bribery probe. It declined comment on the progress of the investigation itself.

""We continue to co-operate in full with the ongoing investigation,"" an Airbus spokesman said. ""The investigation and the book are two separate topics"".

Clark told Reuters she was ""deeply disappointed with the very belated decision by Airbus to withdraw (the book)"".

UK-based publisher Urbane Publications declined to comment.

The book stems from an unusual initiative launched in 2016 under which Airbus granted Clark unprecedented access and full independence to give an unvarnished account of 50 years of industrial co-operation just as Europe's political unity wavers.

It was published on Amazon's Kindle service on May 29, half a century after Airbus was launched at a meeting of Franco-German founders including Roger Beteille, who died last month.

The book was quickly withdrawn from online sale and plans to distribute already-printed copies at the Paris Airshow in June were scrapped at the last minute, casting confusion over the company's 50th anniversary celebrations.

But copies have been circulating and a review was published by Leeham News, a website covering the aviation industry.

Airbus said the version seen by the public was a draft. ""The draft wasn't consistent with our ambition for celebrating 50 years of pioneering progress,"" the Airbus spokesman said.

Clark said Airbus had not described the book as a draft before notifying her of the decision to withdraw it.

The albatross is inspiring tomorrow's aircraft wings - Airbus,"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE5LTA3LXRoZS1hbGJhdHJvc3MtaXMtaW5zcGlyaW5nLXRvbW9ycm93cy1haXJjcmFmdC13aW5nc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The albatross sea bird can soar hundreds of kilometres without flapping its wings. Imitating this flight technique just might help engineers design lighter and more fuel-efficient aircraft.

Of all feathered creatures, the albatross enjoys a legendary status. To bird enthusiasts, it is a majestic animal with the largest wingspan of any living bird. To golfers, it is a score of three-under-par on a single hole. To poetry majors, it is a centuries-old metaphor for a curse or burden. And to many engineers, the albatross is synonymous with the next generation of aircraft wings.

It is not hard to see why the albatross has captured the imagination of engineers: this remarkable sea bird can soar for several hundred kilometres—without flapping its wings! No other bird or winged creature is capable of doing the same. The secret of the albatross’ flight techniques lies in its capacity to “lock” its wing at the shoulder when travelling over long distances. In fact, the albatross can spend up to half of its time facing the wind and using it to fly upward on long trips, thereby covering long distances with very little effort. On the other hand, when faced with wind gusts, the albatross can quickly unlock its wings to better navigate the sudden, brief increase in wind speed.

AlbatrossOne is the first aircraft to trial in-flight, freely flapping wing-tips—which account for up to a third of the length of the wing.

- Tom Wilson, Airbus engineer, Filton, UK

Semi-aeroelastic hinged wing-tips for greater efficiency

Taking inspiration from the albatross, Airbus engineers in Filton, UK, with the support of Airbus ProtoSpace, have developed AlbatrossOne, a small-scale, remote-controlled aircraft demonstrator that has “semi-aeroelastic” hinged wing-tips. “The concept of hinged wing-tips is not new,” explains Airbus engineer Tom Wilson. “Military jets employ them to allow greater storage capacity on aircraft carriers. However, AlbatrossOne is the first aircraft to trial in-flight, freely flapping wing-tips—which account for up to a third of the length of the wing.”

In comparison to freely flapping wing-tips, a conventional wing on an aircraft transmits huge loads to the fuselage during turbulence. This requires the base of the wing to be heavily strengthened, thus adding weight to the aircraft as a result of the heavily reinforced wing boxes. By allowing the wing-tips to react and flex to wind gusts, load is significantly reduced. At the same time, the technique can reduce drag and combat the effects of turbulence and wind gusts.

Inspiration from nature to revolutionise aircraft wing design

Revolutionising aircraft wing design is one of the objectives of AlbatrossOne—a project that draws on inspiration from the albatross’ flight techniques. The demonstrator aircraft, which is a small-scale version based on the A321 aircraft, is constructed from carbon-fibre and glass-fibre-reinforced polymers, as well as components from additive manufacturing.

The first flight tests were concluded in February after a 20-month development programme. The next step for AlbatrossOne is to conduct further flight tests that combine the two flight modes, enabling the wing-tips to unlock during flight and to examine the transition.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999498128890991}",neutral,0.9999498128890991,0
Boeing 737 Max Loses First Customer as Flyadeal Picks Airbus - SupplyChainBrain,"Tue, 09 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1cHBseWNoYWluYnJhaW4uY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzI5OTQ2LWJvZWluZy03MzctbWF4LWxvc2VzLWZpcnN0LWN1c3RvbWVyLWFzLWZseWFkZWFsLXBpY2tzLWFpcmJ1c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Saudi Arabian budget carrier Flyadeal reversed a commitment to buy as many as 50 Boeing Co. 737 Max jets, becoming the first airline to officially drop the plane since its grounding following two deadly crashes.

Flyadeal will operate an entirely Airbus SE fleet, the company said Sunday in a statement, buying as many as 50 A320neo-family planes from Boeing’s European rival.

The Airbus order was booked last month at the Paris Air Show by the discounter’s parent, Saudi Arabian Airlines. That announcement had sparked speculation about whether the planes would be allocated to Flyadeal, which had said in December it would spend up to $5.9bn on Boeing Max jets.

“We understand that Flyadeal will not finalize its commitment to the 737 Max at this time given the airline’s schedule requirements,” Boeing said Sunday in an email. “We wish the Flyadeal team well and hope we can support their fleet and operational needs in the future.”

Flyadeal will take delivery starting in 2021 of 30 Airbus A320neo aircraft, with an option for a further 20 planes from the same family of single-aisle jets.

The decision marks a commercial setback for Boeing, which is under pressure to prove the Max is safe and get it flying again after two disasters five months apart killed a combined 346 people. The narrow-body workhorse has been grounded globally since March.

Amending Orders

The uncertainty surrounding the return of the Max to the skies has prompted carriers to amend aircraft orders. Virgin Australia has pushed back delivery of its first 737 Max jets by almost two years. PT Garuda Indonesia and VietJet Aviation JSC are among the carriers that have also weighed changes in the aftermath of the fatal crashes.

Carriers around the globe are having to redeploy or lease planes, while delaying the retirement of older ones, as Boeing works on a fix for the jet. Emirates, the world’s largest long-haul carrier, has started using Airbus SE A380 superjumbos onto its shortest routes to replace lost capacity after sister carrier FlyDubai reduced services following the idling of its 14-strong Max fleet.

Five Requirements

Europe’s aviation regulator has outlined five major requirements it wants Boeing to address before it will allow the 737 Max to return to service, a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg last week. One of them related to a previously unknown concern about the jet’s autopilot function.

Boeing won Flyadeal as a customer in December when the airline committed to buying 30 737 Max aircraft with an option for another 20. The deal, while subject to final terms and conditions, was considered a major victory for Boeing at the time, given Flyadeal has operated an Airbus fleet.

But the airline began to waver following a second fatal crash involving the plane. If the process of finding a fix for the safety problems took too long, the airline was open to other options, Chief Executive Officer Con Korfiatis told Bloomberg in April.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9972487092018127}",neutral,0.9972487092018127,0
Airbus to tell airlines to check A380 wings for cracks - Yahoo Finance,"Tue, 09 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9haXJidXMtdG8tdGVsbC1haXJsaW5lcy10by1jaGVjay1hLTM4MC13aW5ncy1mb3ItY3JhY2tzLTE0MDQzMTAwOC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An Airbus A380 aircraft.

Airbus (AIR.PA) said on Tuesday that it has told airlines to check 25 older A380 aircraft for cracks after the European Aviation Safety Agency warned that fissures discovered on the wings of several planes could pose a structural integrity risk.

In an airworthiness directive on 5 July, the agency warned that “occurrences have been reported of finding cracks” in certain parts of the wings on A380 aircraft that are currently in service.

The communication from the agency formalised an instruction from Airbus itself, and the plane maker said on Tuesday said that, while the safety of the aircraft was not affected, it had “identified the issue and designed an inspection and repair scheme.”

“We confirm that small cracks have been found on the outer rear wing spars of early production A380 aircraft,” a spokesperson said.

The safety directive concerns 25 of the oldest A380s currently still in operation. The A380, the largest passenger aircraft in the world, launched in 2007, with Singapore Airlines as its maiden carrier.

The repairs must be completed within 15 years of the “wing box” being initially assembled, and can be carried out during scheduled heavy maintenance periods, Airbus said.

Airlines will have to use ultrasonic testing methods for the inspections, according to the safety agency.

This is not the first time that cracks have been found on the A380. In 2012, Airbus was forced to pay millions in repair and service costs for the aircraft over a similar issue.

Airbus will cease production of the A380 in 2021, in part because its largest customer, Emirates, cancelled dozens of orders for the aircraft.

Airbus has “no basis to sustain production, despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years,” CEO Tom Enders said in February, calling the move “painful”.

The company has invested billions in the A380, hoping that it would prove more popular than rival Boeing’s 747 plane.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.7288001179695129}",negative,0.7288001179695129,-1
Airbus aims to inspire with Bird of Prey concept aircraft - New Atlas,"Tue, 23 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1iaXJkLXByZXktY29uY2VwdC82MDcwMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In an effort to spark the imagination of the next generation of aeronautical engineers, Airbus has revealed its new Bird of Prey concept aircraft design. Unveiled at the Royal International Air Tattoo airshow at RAF Fairford, Gloucestershire, UK, the design for a bird-like hybrid-electric, turbo-propeller regional transport aircraft features anatomical features of eagles or falcons.

One annoying problem with engineering is that if a device carries on along one line of development long enough, every machine in a particular class begins to look like all the others. Every smartphone looks like every other smartphone, every compact car looks like every other compact, and every passenger plane looks like all the others.

Part of this is due to the convergence of designs as engineers seek greater efficiency, but there's also a danger that the kind of creativity that can create major breakthroughs might be overlooked, so every now and again new envelope-pushing concepts are introduced to get young brain cells working at capacity on new ideas.

Airbus's new Bird of Prey concept is intended as just such a concept. Introduced on Friday with the backing of the GREAT Britain campaign, the Royal Aeronautical Society, the Air League, the Institution of Engineering, and the Technology and Aerospace Technology Institute, it also highlights Britain's leading role in the aerospace industry as well as celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Airbus group.

Airbus says that the biomimetic aircraft will never be built, but it does suggest some interesting engineering avenues. Birds have been a common source of aeronautical inspiration since the days of Leonardo da Vinici and even today features like anti-vortex wingtips get their start from studying soaring birds.

The Bird of Prey incorporate a number of technologies, such as hybrid-electric propulsion, active control systems, and advanced composite structures. But the most striking features are the wings with large, individually controlled ""feathers"" on the tips and the curved, blended wing-to-fuselage joint forming the aerodynamic arch of some gigantic Roc-like raptor. The fuselage also tapers like that of a bird, ending in a fan-like tail that uses its feathers for stability and active control.

""Our 'Bird of Prey' is designed to be an inspiration to young people and create a 'wow' factor that will help them consider an exciting career in the crucially-important aerospace sector,"" says Martin Aston, a senior manager at Airbus. ""One of the priorities for the entire industry is how to make aviation more sustainable – making flying cleaner, greener and quieter than ever before. We know from our work on the A350 XWB passenger jet that through biomimicry, nature has some of the best lessons we can learn about design. Who can't help but be inspired by such a creation?""

Thermal engines vs. electric motors - Airbus,"Wed, 10 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE5LTA3LXRoZXJtYWwtZW5naW5lcy12cy1lbGVjdHJpYy1tb3RvcnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The transition to electric propulsion is fully underway on a global scale, evidenced by the growing number of hybrid/electric cars and electric drones in the streets and in the skies. But how does electric propulsion – which uses electrical energy supplied by a battery pack or hydrogen fuel cell – compare to traditional, fossil fuel-powered thermal propulsion?

Depending on the machine, combustion engines can appear very different. In large planes and helicopters, the combustion engine takes the form of a turbine. In the turbine, fuel burns in an oxygen-rich environment, creating hot air and high pressure in a confined chamber, and employing that energy to power the aircraft.

In electric-powered vehicles, the motor is composed of a rotor and a stator. With pulses of electricity from a power electronics device, the stator produces a magnetic field around the rotor which rotates and then turns a vehicle’s drive train, rotor shaft, etc. The energy is supplied by a hydrogen fuel cell or a battery pack, which is generally powered by lithium-ion cells. These are similar to the batteries in a laptop, but multiplied by several thousand.

CityAirbus – an urban air vehicle demonstrator designed to be fully-electric and emissions-free – is advancing electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) flight

The limits of thermal-propulsion technology

Combustion engines are ideal for long-range travel because fossil fuels produce a lot of power and energy per kilogram of fuel (power and energy density, respectively). In other words, they enable long-range missions with a limited mass of fuel. And fossil fuel tanks are quite lightweight, considering the fuel mass they contain.

The main drawback is the emissions (NOx, CO2, particles, etc.) they produce. In addition, a lot of fuel is consumed (or wasted) in heat. In fact, three-quarters to two-thirds of fuel energy transforms into heat or is lost via the exhaust. Advances are being made to counter these negatives, like drawing off some of the lost energy from the hot exhaust (to warm up the air before combustion), but these improvements will eventually reach a plateau.

Is electric propulsion the answer? The performance of electric motors and power electronics has vastly improved: today, they achieve a better degree of power density than that of combustion engines. In addition to their light weight, electric motors have a greater range of speed than combustion engines, which reduces the need for gearboxes.

Electric energy presents challenges

The primary challenge of electric energy is that it cannot be stored efficiently (from the perspective of both mass and volume), at least not with today’s technology. In the simplest terms, a large quantity of batteries is required to equal the performance of fuel. This means that the battery in an electric car can represent approximately a third of its empty weight.

Compared to ground vehicles, the mass and volume needed to store energy are more critical on aircraft and rotorcraft because they may directly impact payload and/or performance. And unlike a car’s fuel tank, a battery does not become lighter during the trip – representing another disadvantage.

Mass and volume storage also are problematic for hydrogen fuel cells. This is because the chemical hydrogen must either be stored at high pressure, as in a gas state, or as saturated liquid hydrogen – which needs to be kept at around -253°C and requires large and heavily insulated tanks.

The current usable energy density of rechargeable batteries is approximately 120Wh/kg, compared to fossil fuel’s 12,000Wh/kg*. In other words, the average efficiency of a motor and thermal engine can be equated to: 1 kg of fuel equals 25 to 30 kg of batteries

Finding middle ground: hybrid propulsion

Another option is to combine the best of both worlds. This is known as hybrid-electric propulsion, which uses a combination of conventional internal combustion engine with an electric-propulsion system.

“Hybridisation enables us to optimise,” said Luca Cossetti, Innovative Power Solutions at Airbus Helicopters, who is a part of a team developing a hybrid-propulsion solution for air vehicles. “You could use the thermal engine in certain phases of flight, thereby optimising its efficiency and consumption for that specific situation, and compensate with electrical power when the power demand is higher (such as during take-off and landing for a rotorcraft).”

The future is bright

So what might propulsion look like in future aircraft? For commercial airplanes and helicopters, combustion engines powered by cleaner, more sustainable fuels is already possible: Airbus has delivered wide-body A350 XWB aircraft that use a blend of sustainable jet fuel. In parallel, hybrid-electric propulsion systems are showing great potential for use in mid-sized airplanes and helicopters.

Consider Airbus’ E-Fan X. In this complex hybrid-electric aircraft demonstrator, one of the four jet engines will be replaced by an electric motor. This power is roughly the equivalent to that of 10 medium-sized cars. The electric propulsion unit is powered by a generator-fuelled battery and during descent, the engine blades work like small windmills to generate power and recharge the battery.

The promise of fully-electric propulsion

Such a scenario is already in development for urban transport, where the journey from an airport to a city centre is short, and the payload is comparable to the needs of a taxi. Today, more than 150 urban air mobility (UAM) vehicles – steered by start-ups, automotive manufacturers, established aerospace companies, and others – are in various stages of development worldwide.

These future urban air vehicles are designed to be fully-electric and zero-emission. Airbus is addressing this market by developing the Vahana and CityAirbus, both of which are advancing electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) flight ideally suited for intra-city transport.

A total of 16 A321neos are expected to progressively arrive from the last quarter of 2020. The planes will be deployed on routes within six hours, the airline states.

Of the 16 A321neos that are to be introduced to its fleet, Scoot will convert six A320neo orders to the larger A321neo model and lease another 10 A321neo jets to support the airline’s growth plan by the end of financial year 2020/2021.

“The A321neos will inject growth possibilities to our network plans for 2020 and beyond,” CEO Lee Lik Hsin states in an official press release on July 29, 2019.

Airbus builds passenger planes here in Mobile and is in the process of adding an additional assembly line and hiring more local workers.

But many in the Port City remember feeling robbed after Boeing successfully kept Airbus from building refueling tanker planes right here in Mobile.

In 2008, Airbus initially won a government contract to those planes tankers for the U.S. Air Force, but in what was widely considered a political hat trick by politicians in Boeing's home state of Washington, the military rebid the contract, awarding it to Boeing and leaving Mobile out in the cold.

Airbus kept its promise to Mobile and eventually built a passenger jet assembly plant here.

Boeing’s refueling tanker project languished for years before any planes were delivered.

Then the U.S. Air Force stopped accepting deliveries of Boeing’s KC-46 in April over what it called quality control issues.

Now, NBC News reports Boeing has seen a 37% drop in deliveries for the first half of this year because of the continued grounding of its Max jets, which were involved in two deadly crashes that killed hundreds of people.

Max jets are grounded around the world while Boeing fixes problems that may have contributed to those crashes.

Meanwhile, Airbus orders have surged with the plane maker reporting Tuesday its deliveries are up 28% from a year earlier.

If those trends continue for the rest of the year, Airbus will likely overtake Boeing in the number of full-year deliveries for the first time in eight years, proving the old adage ""Revenge is a dish best served cold"".","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.7046834230422974}",negative,0.7046834230422974,-1

Airbus SE will inspect the wings of its A380 double-decker jets after cracks were found on some planes.

The fissures could reduce the structural integrity of the wings if not repaired, according to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, which is drafting an airworthiness directive on the issue. Aircraft won’t need to be grounded, with fixes to be made during scheduled overhauls.

Checks will initially affect 25 of the oldest superjumbos in service, including planes at Dubai-based Emirates, Qantas Airways Ltd. of Australia and Singapore Airlines Ltd. Remaining planes must be examined before they’re 15 years old.

A wing-crack debacle seven years ago cost Airbus millions of euros in repair and service costs, only one of the glitches to have plagued the world’s biggest passenger plane. Airbus said in February it would stop making the A380 after failing to build up enough of a backlog to keep production going beyond 2021.

An Airbus spokesman said small cracks had been found on the outer rear wing spars of early-production A380s, and that inspections and repairs can be accomplished at the same time as heavy-maintenance checks. The safety of the fleet is not affected, he said.

Airlines must use ultrasonic testing methods and, if damage is found, alert Airbus for repair instructions before the next flight, according to the EASA directive. A380s operated by Deutsche Lufthansa AG, Air France and charter carrier Hi Fly are also listed in the first batch requiring the checks.

Airbus traded virtually unchanged at 124.20 euros as of 5:13 p.m. in Paris. The stock has advanced almost 48% this year, valuing the Toulouse, France-based company at 96 billion euros ($108 billion).","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998773336410522}",neutral,0.9998773336410522,0

The first aircraft, the former Bombardier C Series, should be delivered in September 2021. They will have a capacity of 149 seats and an operating range of 2,300 nautical miles.

The group said the jets would enable it to increase its competitiveness by reducing cost per seat by more than 10 percent compared to the aircraft they will replace.

Air France-KLM’s board has also approved the retirement in principle of the remaining seven A380s from the Air France fleet by 2022, the phase out of three additional aircraft having been decided previously. Five of these aircraft are owned by the company, while two are leased.

In a statement, the group said the current competitive environment “limits the markets in which the A380 can profitably operate”. It added that increasing aircraft maintenance costs, as well as necessary cabin refurbishments, mean that keeping the aircraft in the fleet would involve “significant costs”.

Airbus announced in February 2019 that it would end production of the A380 in 2021 after failing to secure enough orders to make the programme viable.

WHERE DOES THE A380 FLY? LATEST NETWORK UPDATE

Air France-KLM’s chief executive Ben Smith, who joined in September 2018, said the decisions to order the A220s and phase out the A380s support its fleet competitiveness strategy.

“The selection of the Airbus A220-300 supports our goal of a more sustainable operation, by significantly reducing CO2 and noise emissions,” he added.

“This aircraft will also provide our customers with additional comfort on the short- and medium-haul network and will provide our pilots with a connected cockpit with access to the latest navigation technology.”

Air France-KLM operates a fleet of 541 aircraft between its three main brands, Air France, KLM, and Transavia, to 318 destinations globally.

Details of the A220 order and retirement of its A380s came as Air France-KLM posted its financial results for the second quarter of 2019.

Combined passenger and cargo revenues for the three months to 30 June increased by 3.9 percent at constant currency to €6bn. Operating income rose 15.6 percent to €400m, but its fuel bill jumped by €220m.

Second quarter 2019 capacity increased by 3.9 percent, mainly driven by the South American, North Atlantic and Asian networks, with respective growth of 7.8 percent, 6.7 percent and 4.0 percent.

July 8 (UPI) -- Saudi Arabian airline flyadeal announced plans to operate a fleet comprising only Airbus aircraft after canceling an order for Boeing's globally grounded 737 Max Jets. The airline announced Sunday that it placed an order for 30 Airbus A320neo airplanes for $5.5 billion with an option for 20 additional A320neo family aircraft. Advertisement

""This order will result in flyadeal operating an all-Airbus A320 fleet in the future,"" the airline said.

Flyadeal tentatively agreed to a $5.9 billion provisional order with Boeing for the 737 Max planes, but decided to cancel the deal after a pair of crashes involving the aircraft that killed 346 people.

""Boeing is proud of its seven-decade long partnership with Saudi Arabia's aviation industry and we wish the flyadeal team well as it builds out its operations. Our team continues to focus on safely returning the 737 Max to service and resuming deliveries of Max airplanes,"" Boeing said in a statement to CNBC.

Boeing has frozen deliveries of the 737 Max after the crashes and late last month, the Federal Aviation Administration said it discovered a new potential risk with the aircraft that the company must mitigate.

The plane's black box recorder reveals that the Lion Air plane had experienced problems with its airspeed indicators on its last four flights. 7 November 2018 Boeing's new advice Boeing issues revised instructions on how pilots should react to erroneous readings from “angle of attack” sensors, believed to be a key factor in the Lion Air crash. 10 March 2019 Ethiopia Airlines crash Flight ET302 crashes about six minutes after taking off from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people onboard. The captain had reported difficulties, and flight radar data shows the aircraft was climbing erratically with an unstable vertical airspeed. 13 March 2019 Boeing grounds fleet The EU, Canada and the US all ground the Boeing 737 Max. Boeing itself issues a statement saying it “continues to have full confidence in the safety of the 737 Max”, but that “out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public” it w recommending the grounding of the entire global fleet of 371 aircraft. 4 April 2019 Interim report findings The interim report into the Ethiopian Airlines crash finds that the pilots correctly followed Boeing’s emergency instructions, but were still unable to stop the plane’s nose repeatedly pointing down. The jet hit an airspeed of 500 knots (575mph), well above its operational limits, before cockpit data recordings stopped.

27 June 2019 A new potential risk Airlines extend their ban on using the Boeing 737 Max after the US aviation regulator said it had identified a new potential risk with the plane. 10 July 2019 Airbus soars In the wake of Boeing’s troubles, Airbus seems set to overtake it as the world's biggest planemaker. As Boeing reported 239 commercial plane deliveries in the first half of the year, a 37% fall, rival Airbus shipped 389 deliveries, up 28% on the same period last year. 15 July 2019 Name change rumours Pictures emerge of a Boeing 737 Max due to be delivered to Ryanair with the name 737 Max replaced by 737-8200 on the nose. 30 October 2019 Sensor concerns ignored During congressional hearings into Boeing’s handling of the crisis, lawmakers were shown internal records revealing that three years before the crashes an employee had expressed concern that an anti-stall flight system could be triggered by a single sensor. 10 January 2020 The crisis deepens with the release of hundreds of internal messages between employees working on the 737 Max aircraft, which boasted of deceiving safety regulators and said the plane had been “designed by clowns”. 19 February 2020 Boeing orders inspections of its entire fleet of grounded 737 Max planes after it found foreign object debris in the fuel tanks of some of the mothballed planes.

Rival Airbus has reported 389 deliveries in the first half, up 28% on the same period last year, and is on track to deliver a record number of planes this year, overtaking Boeing for the first time in seven years.

Before the crash, Boeing was delivering planes at a rate of 50 a month in the first quarter. Output has since slumped to only 30 a month in the second quarter. Boeing halted deliveries of the top-selling plane since it was grounded in mid-March.

There are more than 150 undelivered Max planes parked at sites around the US as well as 380 owned by airlines that remain grounded. June was the third month running that Boeing booked no new orders of its Max aircraft. Air regulators are not expected to clear the model to fly again before the end of September as the company continues to work on fixing the aircraft’s flight-control systems.

Airbus has been ramping up the pressure on Boeing by pushing its best-selling A320neo, a direct rival to the Max, and publicly announcing an increase in production.

This week Boeing lost a provisional deal for 50 737 Max planes from flyadeal, the budget arm of Saudi Arabian Airlines, which instead ordered the Airbus rival. The deal, with a value of more than $5.5bn (£4.4bn), is one of the first direct signs that the Max crashes have resulted in business shifting to Boeing’s rival.

However, last month at the Paris air show Boeing was given a shot in the arm when International Airlines Group, the parent of British Airways, signed a “letter of intent” to buy 200 Boeing 737 Max aircraft in the first new sales deal for the passenger jet since it was grounded. The IAG order is yet to be officially booked by Boeing.

Six Additional Airbus A320 for the Austrian Airlines Fleet - aviator.aero,"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20uYXZpYXRvci5hZXJvL3NpeC1hZGRpdGlvbmFsLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIwLWZvci10aGUtYXVzdHJpYW4tYWlybGluZXMtZmxlZXQv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzcm9vbS5hdmlhdG9yLmFlcm8vc2l4LWFkZGl0aW9uYWwtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjAtZm9yLXRoZS1hdXN0cmlhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1mbGVldC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CCO Andreas Otto: “Strong signal towards low cost competitors”

First aircraft scheduled for delivery in August 2019

Fleet development: Jets will gradually replace turboprops

The fleet development announced in January 2019 is taking shape now: Austrian Airlines has now secured six additional A320 aircraft. The first of these jets is scheduled for delivery in August. Within the next few days, it will already receive the red-white-red Austrian color scheme in Jacksonville/USA. A total of ten additional jets are to replace the 18 Dash 8-400 turboprop aircraft by 2021. Austrian will thus increase its Airbus fleet from 36 to 46 aircraft. As of June 30, 2019, the entire Austrian Airlines fleet consisted of 82 aircraft.

""These six additional A320s should also be understood as a strong signal towards low cost competition. We are defending our market position and are determined to fight for our customers"", Austrian Airlines CCO Andreas Otto explains the strategic fleet development.

Four A320 aircraft from Avianca Brasil, two from Juneyao

Four of the six additional A320 jets are leased from Aviation Capital and previously flew at Avianca Brasil. In part, these aircraft are already being subject to the necessary delivery check. The first A320 plane is expected to be transferred to Austrian Airlines in the middle of August. Additional planes will be supplied at the end of August as well as in September and October. Following the necessary modifications and adaptations, the first aircraft should be put into operation on Austrian Airline’s behalf in December of this year. Austrian Airlines will take possession of two other Airbus jets purchased from CDB Aviation, which are currently operated by Star Alliance Connecting Partner Juneyao.

Dash phase-out in full swing

In 2019 Austrian Airlines has already decommissioned two Dash aircraft. The hand over of a further Dash turboprop is planned this year. Nine other Dash turboprops are scheduled to be phased out from the Austrian Airlines fleet in the course of 2020, the remaining six will follow in 2021.
