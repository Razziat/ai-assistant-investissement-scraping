Airbus reports record deliveries in 2012 - CBS News,"Thu, 17 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLXJlcG9ydHMtcmVjb3JkLWRlbGl2ZXJpZXMtaW4tMjAxMi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BLAGNAC, France Airbus refused to be drawn into the problems afflicting Boeing Co.'s Dreamliner plane as it reported a record number of deliveries for last year.

Speaking to reporters at the company's annual commercial results presentation Thursday, Airbus Chief Executive Fabrice Bregier says it wasn't his place to ""give Boeing lessons"" and noted that the European aircraft maker has had problems of its own ""in the past.""

Airbus said it plans to increase production again this year to deliver more than 600 aircraft from 2012's 588, while taking in new orders for at least 700 jets. In 2012, it took in orders for 914 new jets, above expectations.

Boeing's 787 Dreamliners have been grounded by aviation organizations around the world, including the U.S. Federal Aviation Authority and the European Aviation Safety Authority, following concerns about the safety of the airplane's lithium ion battery system.

""It's not our place to give Boeing lessons, we've had our own problems in the past, Bregier said. ""About the batteries, the certification agencies seemed very happy with the architecture of our aircraft. If the FAA issues a directive, we will look very carefully to see if it applies to the A350.""

""I honestly wish all the best to my colleagues at Boeing to put this aircraft back in flight,"" he added. ""I don't bet on the difficulties of a competitor in order to build Airbus' success.""

Airbus expects its new A350 wide-body jet, a rival to Boeing's 787, to make its first flight around the middle of the year. Pressed on whether the inaugural flight could come during the Paris air show in June, Bregier joked that he had ""too much respect"" for air show organizers to divert attention to Toulouse, where the flight will take place, from the biannual gathering at Bourget airport outside Paris.

""It will be either just before or just after the air show,"" Bregier promised.

Airbus only sold nine of its superjumbo A380 jets last year, due to a combination of technical problems with the aircraft's wing ribs and the poor European economy. But chief salesman John Leahy pledged he'd get at least 25 orders for the massive jet this year. Airbus delivered 30 of the A380s last year.

Declaring that the problem with the wing ribs was "" now behind us,"" CEO Bregier said the cause of the problem had been found a solution was being put in place for the nine airlines currently flying the giant aircraft.

Airbus said it will deliver 25 of the A380 this year.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.999825656414032}",negative,0.999825656414032,-1
A Shower and Bar on an Airplane?! The Emirates Airbus is More Like a Hotel - SoraNews24,"Mon, 14 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vc29yYW5ld3MyNC5jb20vMjAxMy8wMS8xNC9hLXNob3dlci1hbmQtYmFyLW9uLWFuLWFpcnBsYW5lLXRoZS1lbWlyYXRlcy1haXJidXMtaXMtbW9yZS1saWtlLWEtaG90ZWwv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly9zb3JhbmV3czI0LmNvbS8yMDEzLzAxLzE0L2Etc2hvd2VyLWFuZC1iYXItb24tYW4tYWlycGxhbmUtdGhlLWVtaXJhdGVzLWFpcmJ1cy1pcy1tb3JlLWxpa2UtYS1ob3RlbC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ever wanted to see the inside of a luxury aircraft, but don’t have the dough to make your dream a reality? One of our normally frugal writers decided to splurge and take a business class flight on an Emirates Airbus A380. Surprised by the wide array of perks the flight offered, she documented the best parts of the trip. Take a look at her photographs of the surprising amenities, like an inflight bar lounge and shower, which make this plane seem more like a hotel. It’s not quite the same as boarding the plane yourself, but unlike the flight, reading this article won’t cost you a penny and you’re free to move about the cabin at any time.

———————————-

When you choose to travel, what is most important to you? For me, keeping costs low is my top priority, but last week I decided to change my thinking and booked a trip based on service alone.

After browsing the Emirates home page and looking at all of the pictures on the site, I decided that it looked more like a hotel than an aircraft. Convinced by what I saw, I booked a flight on an Emirates airbus A380. It’s been about a week since I came back from my trip and I have to say that I was thoroughly impressed by the flight. Here are the highlights:

■ The plane has a bar lounge!

Both first and business class cabins of the Emirates Airbus A380 have bar lounges. Unlike my fellow passengers, I couldn’t sleep, so if I got hungry I could just go to the bar lounge. There were cup o’ noodles, sandwiches, chocolates and other light snacks, and of course a large selection of alcoholic drinks to choose from. To top it all off, the staff was very friendly and easy to talk to, just like at an actual bar.

▲ The bar lounge seating looks like it belongs on a spaceship.

■ The ceiling of the plane looks like a planetarium!

Shortly after we boarded the airbus, the lights dimmed and the ceiling began to change. Then, stars were projected onto the walls of the aircraft. It was beautiful! When the lights slowly come up, they start off looking like dawn and slowly get brighter and brighter. Since I couldn’t sleep, I had fun watching the changes.

■ There’s an electrical outlet near your seat and WiFi in the cabin

Nowadays, many people bring their personal computers on a plane. The time sitting on the plane won’t be wasted if you do work while you fly, but your computer’s battery life is always a factor. However, that’s not a problem if you’re on an Airbus A380.

Every seat, regardless of class, is equipped with an electrical outlet and anyone can use Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi isn’t free unless you are a first class passenger, but it only costs $10.

■ Each seat looks like a private room

The first and business class seats are designed in such a way that you will practically never see the person next to you. It’s almost as if you have a private room. If you want to share your “private room” with another person, there are two-person configurations as well.

The first class area is composed of true private rooms. You’ll be able to relax all by yourself.

■ Seats can change into a massage chair or bed

All first class and business class seats are equipped with massage functions that can be used at any time. Also, before the lights are dimmed, a cabin attendant will lay cushy sleeping bedding on your chair so you can sleep peacefully. First class cabins have beds similar to those you use at home, but the business class seats recline all the way down… I slept like a baby!

■ There’s a waterfall inside the plane!!!

When I overheard a flight attendant saying the airbus had a waterfall, I didn’t believe her. She then took me to the bar lounge and there it was, an actual waterfall inside the plane.

■ Take a shower at 4,000 feet!

The coolest part about the flight was the shower. I was expecting it to resemble the small, coffin-like restrooms on any normal plane, but it wasn’t anything like that. The shower on the Emirates airbus was surprisingly roomy and even came with Emirates-brand shampoo!

▲ There is even an orchid flower arrangement in the shower booth.

▲ First class freebies!

■ The food was amazing!

It was hard to choose an inflight meal because there were too many options. In total, there were 18 different sets including an “Oriental” vegetarian set, Jainism vegetarian set, and even a set for passengers with diabetes.

I ordered the low-salt entrée and my husband had the meal for people who are lactose intolerant. Both were delicious! Many low-salt airplane meals that I have tried in the past were disgusting, so Emirates’ tasty low-salt entrée was a pleasant surprise.

▲ The sushi was unexpectedly spicy, but delicious.

■ You can even insert your USB memory stick and view documents on the seatback screen.

It’s a simple function, but I was so surprised to find that I could plug in my USB stick and look at pictures using the seatback screen. It’s probably more useful for businessmen, but I still think it’s a cool feature of the flight.

■ Free champagne at any time

Business class passengers can enjoy complementary Moët champagne. First class, meanwhile, can sip on Dom Pérignon.

■ A beautiful view

The Haneda to Dubai flight goes right over the Himalayas. This is a picture I took with my phone.

From Japan, this wonderful flight on the Emirates Airbus A380 is only available from Haneda to Dubai. For those who don’t have any plans to visit Dubai, there are plenty of connecting flights to Europe that you can choose.

■ Free Beauty Pack for women

Women who ride in business or first class receive a complementary beauty pack (perfume, hand crème, etc.) in a Bvlgari pouch.

■ The Emirates business lounge at the Dubai airport is kid friendly

I recommend Emirates business class for passengers traveling with small children because the business lounge is complete with a “kids’ space.” Not only do they have a playground, but snacks for children are also available.

Even though my flight on Emirates was more expensive than flights with other carriers, the time I spent on the airplane felt more like a stay at a hotel. Taking the Emirates airbus A380 was a New Year’s present to myself and now I’m feeling refreshed and ready to take on 2013.

Hawaiian Airlines expands its fleet of Airbus aircraft - USA TODAY,"Tue, 08 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTMvMDEvMDgvaGF3YWlpYW4tYWlyYnVzLWJvZWluZy1hMzIxbmVvLzE4MTcxNDEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hawaiian Airlines expands its fleet of Airbus aircraft

Hawaiian Airlines plans to buy Airbus A321neo planes, ending Boeing's dominance over flights between the islands to the mainland.

Hawaiian announced this week that it has agreed to buy 16 of the new aircraft from the French manufacturer between 2017 and 2020. It also will have the right to purchase another nine aircraft.

The order is valued at $2.8 billion. The purchase is contingent upon Hawaiian signing new agreements with its pilots and flight attendants unions regarding operation of the new aircraft. The Honolulu-based carrier estimates that the fleet expansion could produce an additional 1,000 jobs at Hawaiian.

""This is a significant investment in the future of both Hawaiian and Hawai'i. Our tourism-based economy and local employment will benefit as we continue our strategy of diversifying our business while improving the efficiency of our operation,"" Mark Dunkerley, president and CEO of Hawaiian Airlines, said in a written statement.

The airline said that the long-range, single-aisle A321neo will complement Hawaiian's existing fleet of wide-body, twin-aisle aircraft used for long-haul flying between Hawaii and the U.S. West Coast.

Dunkerley said in his statement that the new aircraft fits the airline's strategy to offer better service to more destinations in a cost-efficient way.

""Ordering the A321neo will secure this legacy on routes to the U.S. West Coast beyond the middle of this decade,"" he said. ""The A321neo will be the most fuel-efficient aircraft of its type after its introduction in 2016. With its slightly smaller size we'll be able to open new markets that are not viable for wide-body service, while also being able to augment service on existing routes to the West Coast of North America.""

The A321neo will seat about 190 passengers in first and coach class and can travel about 3,650 nautical miles.

Reuters points out that Airbus now has won Hawaiian's last three competitions, supplying A330s, A350s and now the A321neo.

Seattle-based Boeing, Airbus' main competitor, declined to comment to Reuters.

Hawaiian has a fleet of 43 aircraft right now. They comprise 25 wide-body, long-haul aircraft, which include the 294-seat Airbus A330-200 aircraft and 264-seat Boeing 767-300ER aircraft. It has 18 narrow-body 123-seat Boeing 717-200 aircraft for island-to-island routes.

According to Bloomberg, Hawaiian plans to continue using the 717s for the inter-island routes.

""The Boeing 717s are absolutely the best airplane built today for flying between the islands in the state of Hawaii,"" Dunkerley told Bloomberg. ""We're very happy with them. We intend to keep operating them at least until the end of the decade. Beyond that, we'll have to see what's available.""

The airline also has existing orders for another 13 new A330s between 2013 and 2015 and six next-generation, longer-range A350XWB-800 aircraft starting in 2017. The carrier is phasing out its existing fleet of 16 Boeing 767s over the next decade.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9621089696884155}",positive,0.9621089696884155,1
"Airbus examines lithium battery safety, fire suppression - Leeham News and Analysis","Mon, 28 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMy8wMS8yOC9haXJidXMtZXhhbWluZXMtbGl0aGl1bS1iYXR0ZXJ5LXNhZmV0eS1maXJlLXN1cHByZXNzaW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Note: The NTSB Sunday said it still doesn’t know what caused the lithium ion battery to catch fire on the JAL Boeing 787.

Japan has shifted focus to a monitoring system, not the battery. The battery charger has been cleared by the NTSB.

Japan eased safety standards ahead of service, according to a news report.

********************************************************************

Airbus officials are trying to keep a low profile during the focus on Boeing’s 787 lithium ion battery problems, but since the A350 XWB will also have this battery type, Airbus gets pulled into the story whether it wants to or not.

Airbus officials are concerned whatever the US Federal Aviation Administration decides is ultimately necessary for Boeing to fix the lithium ion problems and restore the 787 to service, it might have a knock-on effect to certifying the A350.

There are several issues: fire prevention; fire suppression; battery safety; risks and so on.

Although Airbus responded to some questions at its annual press conference, and has selectively talked about the Boeing situation since, it’s declined useful comment on some specific questions, notably about fire suppression.

As details emerged following the Japan Air Lines Boeing 787 fire, Boeing indicated that the airplane doesn’t have fire suppression around the lithium-ion batteries. Several news stories have been written about this, including this one we previously linked. This, of course, begs the question: will the Airbus A350 have fire suppression around its lithium-ion batteries, which are of a different design than those in the 787? We asked Airbus and got this answer:

“Airbus will carefully study any recommendations that come out of the 787 investigation and evaluate whether they would apply to the A350.”

Well, that was certainly helpful.

As it turns out, Airbus has talked about lithium ion batteries before. Airbus in March 2012 made a presentation on lithium-ion batteries at a Flight Safety Conference in Berlin. Airbus on Lithium-Ion Battery Safety

There are a couple of key slides in the presentation that deserve calling out here. The first set deal with risks and causes:

And the types of lithium batteries:

Note on the following slide, fire suppression is discussed in the lower right hand corner.

And this one on fire suppression:

And another on the challenges of fighting thermal runaway:

The following slide makes reference to Airbus’ design for the lithium-ion batteries allows for venting within the battery, a key point the MIT professor makes with respect to the 787 (see the link at the end of this post).

We asked Airbus for a walk-through of these slides; it declined. We asked Airbus about its fire suppression design for the batteries. It declined comment.

Given Boeing’s previous comments about the inability to suppress a thermal runaway, and the Airbus slides above, it is reasonable to conclude Airbus does not have a fire suppression system in the A350, either. Instead, it made the decision to stay with traditional hydraulic and pneumatic architecture for many of the systems, which results in a requirement for about one-third of the electrical power needed on the 787 and less than that of the A330.

Airbus also said it has four ion batteries rather than two on the 787, thus spreading the load. The slides above also suggest Airbus is venting the batteries themselves, which according to MIT, Boeing is not. Boeing declined comment.

The New York Times has this article that talks about the cozy relationship between Boeing and Japan, relating it to the selection of a Japanese company to supply the batteries for the 787.

Richard Aboulafia thinks the 787’s grounding could be 6-9 months, echoing sentiment expressed by Ernie Arvai at AirInsight. As we reported Sunday, an official with MIT thinks the airplane could be grounded for a year if the lithium-ion batteries have to be replaced and the supporting systems redesigned. This article refers to venting the battery, at Airbus infers in its slide show.

Travel Q&A: How can I take a short Airbus A380 flight? - The Mercury News,"Wed, 16 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lcmN1cnluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDEzLzAxLzE2L3RyYXZlbC1xYS1ob3ctY2FuLWktdGFrZS1hLXNob3J0LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLWZsaWdodC_SAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5tZXJjdXJ5bmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMy8wMS8xNi90cmF2ZWwtcWEtaG93LWNhbi1pLXRha2UtYS1zaG9ydC1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1mbGlnaHQvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Q I want to take a short ride on an Airbus A380 super jumbo for as little cost as possible. Can you suggest a few short, relatively inexpensive routes that are served by this aircraft? Any airline is fine.

A Although prices will always depend on the season, date and time of travel, there are a lot of great options for hopping on the A380.

One of the least expensive is to travel between Auckland, New Zealand, and Sydney on an Emirates’ flight. I found a one-way flight on that route in an A380 for $169 (in New Zealand currency), although fares fluctuate all the time.

Thai Airways flies its sole A380 within Asia primarily between Bangkok and Tokyo/Hong Kong. On the same route between Bangkok and Hong Kong, Emirates flies its own A380. You will also find the A380 on China Southern domestic flights Guangzhou to Beijing and Beijing to Shanghai.

When British Airways takes deliveries of its A380s this year, it will put them on short intra-European routes for crew training purposes (much as Air France did). It won’t last long and the routes are not yet announced.

Q I know several airlines (United, Delta, for example) now have seats that cost more than economy, less than first or business class, but are roomier. What is an easy way to find out pricing on those seats?

A Besides United and Delta, American Airlines and JetBlue sell extra legroom economy-class seats for an additional fee on both domestic and international flights, as do a number of foreign-based airlines (Air France, British Airways, Cathay Pacific and many others).

These seats aren’t usually any wider than standard seats on domestic U.S. airlines (they are somewhat wider on international airlines), but they do offer more legroom.

It’s not particularly easy to learn how much the extra legroom will cost you without actually attempting to book a seat on the airline’s own website (these extra-legroom seats aren’t typically bookable on third-party sites such as Travelocity.com). Pricing depends on the route and flight. American clearly states a possible price range ($8 to $118 per flight) on its website.

In addition to these separate sections, exit-row seats offer considerably more legroom, but these seats are sometimes only available for advance booking to “elite” frequent fliers.

Several smaller airlines, such as Spirit and AirTran, offer inexpensive upgrades to business-class seats. VirginAmerica sells exit-row and bulkhead seats in advance for rather steep fees (“Main Cabin Select,” www.virginamerica.com/travel/cabins.html) with 6 inches of extra legroom (plus free food and drinks, a free checked bag and priority check-in).

And all JetBlue planes have more legroom than those on other domestic airlines.

Boeing beats Airbus for 2012 orders - Euronews,"Thu, 17 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9uZXdzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEzLzAxLzE3L2JvZWluZy1iZWF0cy1haXJidXMtZm9yLTIwMTItb3JkZXJz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has lost its top spot to its US arch-rival Boeing even though the European planemaker delivered record numbers of airliners last year.

But despite no longer being the number one, Airbus is confident of improvements in both orders and deliveries this year as airlines look to replace their fleets with more fuel efficient planes.

It delivered 588 aircraft to 89 customers last year.

Orders were a different story. Airbus was not able to repeat 2011’s record of 1,419. Net orders – that is after cancellations – totalled 833 in 2012, down 41 percent.

That was far short of Boeing’s 1,203 net orders – a 49 percent increase fro 2011’s 805.

The orders totals were announced as Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner was grounded by European and US authorities because of a potential fire risk from its batteries.

It is not yet clear how much of a set back that will be for Boeing, but aerospace analyst Carter Leake with BB&T Capital Markets said it could cost the planemaker dear: “Boeing is going to forge ahead, regardless, they have to. If they find something that needs to be recertified, they will do that post production and that’s costly. It can impede deliveries and so that’s the risk.”

The 787 is made of carbon-composite, like the A350 Airbus is developing as a rival. Airbus said it remains confident that the A350 will achieve its maiden flight by the middle of this year.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.973045289516449}",negative,0.973045289516449,-1
Photos: Hawaiian Airlines Orders Airbus A321neos - Airline Reporter,"Wed, 09 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMy8wMS9waG90b3MtaGF3YWlpYW4tYWlybGluZXMtb3JkZXJzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIxbmVvcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On Monday Hawaiian Airlines made a big announcement that it was ordering the Airbus A321neo to add to its expanding fleet.

The order is for 16 A321neo’s along with the rights to purchase up to nine more of the type. The carrier currently has 43 aircraft that is a mix of Boeing 767-300ER that it primarily uses on its west coast operations from the islands, the A330-200 used on international long haul ops and the Boeing 717 that it uses for inter-island hopping.

“Everyone at Hawaiian wants us to keep our position as the market leader in service quality, cost efficiency and choice of destinations. Ordering the A321neo will secure this legacy on routes to the U.S. West Coast beyond the middle of this decade,” said Mark Dunkerley, president and CEO of Hawaiian Airlines. “The A321neo will be the most fuel-efficient aircraft of its type after its introduction in 2016. With its slightly smaller size we’ll be able to open new markets that are not viable for wide-body service, while also being able to augment service on existing routes to the West Coast of North America.”

At 146-feet-long, the A321neo will seat approximately 190 passengers in a two-class configuration (First and Coach) and has a range of 3,650 nautical miles. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed, however, the aircraft have a total list-price value of approximately $2.8 billion if all of the purchase rights are exercised.

The new acquisitions are also contingent upon Hawaiian signing new agreements with its pilots and flight attendant unions covering operation of the new aircraft type. If new agreements are reached, the fleet expansion is expected to generate roughly 1,000 additional jobs at the airline.

“This is a significant investment in the future of both Hawaiian and Hawaii. Our tourism-based economy and local employment will benefit as we continue our strategy of diversifying our business while improving the efficiency of our operation,” Dunkerley commented.

“We have come to think of Hawaiian Airlines as ‘ohana’ (family) and are very pleased to add yet another branch to our tree with this pending expansion of the Hawaiian Airbus fleet,” said John Leahy, Airbus chief operating officer, customers. “Hawaiian has gotten great results with their A330s.”

There is much speculation from analyst and fans where the aircraft will be flown, whether they will take over the current 767 west coast routes or lead to expansion for Hawaiian to operate to new west coast operations. By the time these aircraft join the fleet their 767’s will be around 18 to 20 years old for the leased ones and 30 years with the four that it purchased from Delta in 2005.

Other ideas are this purchase is to keep the A350 and A330-200s free to continue what has been a rather aggressive expansion from the quite airlines on the islands.

Under Hawaiian’s memorandum of understanding with Airbus, 16 of the aircraft would be delivered between 2017 and 2020. Hawaiian would then have rights to purchase up to nine additional copies. Total value of all 25 jets would be $2.8 billion, based on current list prices.

With about 190 seats split between two classes, the new A321neo’s would be used to compliment and expand the airline’s existing fleet, which currently consists of widebody 25 Boeing 767-300ERs and 18 Airbus A330-200s.

Airbus promises a useful range of 3,650 nautical miles for their new A321neo. A quick map glance shows this range should should allow Hawaiian to fly them on US west coast routes without a problem, and perhaps even as far east as Denver or Salt Lake City.

“Everyone at Hawaiian wants us to keep our position as the market leader in service quality, cost efficiency and choice of destinations. Ordering the A321neo will secure this legacy on routes to the U.S. West Coast beyond the middle of this decade,” said Mark Dunkerley, president and CEO of Hawaiian Airlines in a statement. “The A321neo will be the most fuel-efficient aircraft of its type after its introduction in 2016. With its slightly smaller size we’ll be able to open new markets that are not viable for wide-body service, while also being able to augment service on existing routes to the West Coast of North America.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999313354492188}",neutral,0.9999313354492188,0
"I’m flying on the Dreamliner, again. - Al Jazeera English","Wed, 16 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvMjAxMy8xLzE2L2ltLWZseWluZy1vbi10aGUtZHJlYW1saW5lci1hZ2FpbtIBUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vYW1wL2ZlYXR1cmVzLzIwMTMvMS8xNi9pbS1mbHlpbmctb24tdGhlLWRyZWFtbGluZXItYWdhaW4?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Spate of recent problems has raised safety concerns about the Dreamliner and cast as shadow on Boeing’s reputation.

Boeing’s Dreamliner is a remarkable airplane. Its construction using composite materials had its biggest rival Airbus scrambling to develop a competitor after betting large on the A380 double-decker superjumbo.

But a spate of recent problems has raised safety concerns about the Dreamliner and cast as shadow on Boeing’s reputation.

“This is comparable to Toyota’s recall, Airbus had similar problems with the A380,” said Bernhard Bauhofer, managing partner at reputation management firm Sparring Partners in Switzerland.

“The race between Airbus and Boeing is like an inter-continental ballistic war. Quality is suffering to make way for speed, development is happening so fast safety is suffering.”

Bouhofer’s also concerned with the way to two aircraft manufacturers farm out work: “You can’t delegate management… it’s just uncontrollable.”

“If you’re a customer flying on any airline you’ll probably take a closer look at what plane you’ll be flying on.”

“It’s important Boeing works with the airlines to build a communications plan that tackles the consumers’ concerns.”

Building a plane is a complicated process. Ray Conner, the Chief Executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, rarely give interviews.

“In an industry full of brash back-slappers with outsized personalities, Conner stands out by not standing out. When he assumed his new role, the governor of Washington even spelled his name wrong in a press release.” (Reuters)

But right now he’s the man facing the flack over the incident-prone 787 Dreamliner, in early December last year I sat down to interview him.

I put it to him why the industry was having trouble bringing big projects in on time and budget.

“We took a big step in technology and I think that step in technology of course was such a departure from what we have done in the past so that was a real learning experience for us, and a lot of things that you can’t anticipate come up as you move forward. We changed not only the type of composite materials, we went more for an electric plane, we changed the business model.”

Boeing replaced the hydraulic systems with electrical ones, and it appears the problems is the lithium-ion batteries. There are alternatives.

It’s a plane the airlines love because its lighter, flies further and helps them to be more profitable. With each plane costing $206m, airlines will most likely use these incidents and delays to drive down the price.

Flying has never been safer, I know Boeing and the airlines wouldn’t put on unsafe flights. Having been to Boeing’s industrious plant in Seattle — I’m sure its engineers will figure this out. I’m looking forward to my next trip on the 787 on the way back from Switzerland next week.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9866934418678284}",negative,0.9866934418678284,-1

The European aircraft manufacturer Airbus said on Thursday that it was on track to deliver its badly-needed new A400M transport plane to the French air force in the second quarter of this year, after its latest problems with engines was resolved.""We have overcome this engine problem, which had delayed certification"" of a cutting-edge plane that could mark a big step forward in logistics capacity for the eight countries which have bought it, Airbus chief executive Fabrice Bregier told a press conference in Toulouse, southern France.He hailed efforts by the companies that have collaborated on the plane's innovative eight-bladed propeller engines, including Rolls-Royce, Safran of France, the German company MTU and ITP of Spain, which together formed a joint venture named Euro Prop International (EPI).Test flights that had been suspended for several months were ""resumed in November and we totalled 300 test hours in 26 days,"" Bregier noted.""The first delivery to France was pushed back slightly from the first quarter to the second quarter of 2013,"" he said, adding that Airbus would not have to pay any penalties for the delay.France in particular needs to get the A400M into service as its limited airlift capacity was demonstrated again by the conflict in Mali, where Belgium, Britain, Denmark and Germany have extended help delivering material and troops from France and contributing African countries.""We have again today the confirmation that transport aircraft are decisive assets in all sorts of conflicts, security operations or rescues: France does not have this capacity and we have demonstrated the A400M's potential,"" Bregier said.The four-engine aircraft was designed to replace C-130 Hercules and C-160 Transall cargo planes, and can perform three major roles, according to Airbus, including tactical missions that require the ability to land at ""austere airfields"" such as soft or rough strips as short as 750 metres (2,500 feet) with a payload of up to 25 tonnes (55,000 pounds).That makes the plane suited for direct deployment on humanitarian aid missions to disaster-hit regions. In a strategic role, the plane can fly up to 8,700 kilometres (5,400 miles) with a payload of up to 37 tonnes (81,600 pounds), including dissasembled helicopters or two heavy armoured vehicles, and reach altitudes of up to 40,000 feet (12,000 metres). Finally, the A400M can be adapted in two hours for use as an air refuelling tanker able to serve two planes or helicopters at a time.In an airdrop capacity, the transport plane can operate from as high as 40,000 feet for special operations purposes to as low as 15 feet for low-level load deliveries, Airbus said, and ""can carry more paratroopers than any other Western-built military aircraft,"" with 116 fully equipped soldiers.A total of 174 of the planes have been ordered to date, with four currently in the final assembly stage, and scheduled for delivery this year.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8834215402603149}",neutral,0.8834215402603149,0

European jetmaker raised concerns about lithium-ion batteries nearly a year before that same battery type became a focal in incidents that helped prompt the grounding of rival Boeing's 787 Dreamliners.

That's according to Reuters, which writes ""Airbus spelled out lithium hazards at a forum of airline customers in March 2012, citing the risk of flames, explosion, smoke and leakage in the event of a so-called thermal runaway or uncontrolled battery overheating.""

""The risks associated to lithium batteries require the attention of the entire industry,"" Reuters quotes Airbus as saying in slides accompanying a presentation by Christine Bezard, the flight safety leader of Airbus' planned A350 jet that also will use the lithium-ion batteries.

As for that presentation, Reuters says it ""covered consumer products carried in the cabin or stored as baggage, as well as batteries used in emergency devices such as flashlights and beacons or, in a slide showing the A350, system batteries built into aircraft.""

Airbus would not comment to Reuters regarding the March 2012 presentation, though both Airbus and Boeing have insisted their battery designs are safe.

Lithium-ion batteries, popular because they are lightweight and powerful, have become a staple for products such as smartphones and hybrid vehicles. However, Reuters says they pose a greater fire risk ""if managed improperly … based on their chemical makeup.""

Airbus tells Reuters it would not comment on its A350 battery design, though an Airbus spokesman adds: ""Airbus will carefully study recommendations that come out of the 787 investigation and evaluate whether they apply to the A350.""","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9835302233695984}",negative,0.9835302233695984,-1

Airbus had won the previous year's order race by a record margin and had been expected to draw a response as the planemakers waged a two-year contest to win orders by offering airlines significant fuel savings over earlier models.

Adjusted for cancellations, Airbus had 833 net orders.

Gross orders stood well ahead of the company's 2012 target of 650 jets but compared with Boeing's comparable figure of 1,339 new aircraft, giving Airbus a market share of 41 percent.

Boeing led on net orders with 921 aircraft.

Airbus also backed the use of lithium-ion batteries on its future A350 passenger jet on Thursday, saying its next aircraft was designed differently from the Dreamliner.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999750852584839}",positive,0.9999750852584839,1

Question: I read that Airbus will offer ""Back to Basics"" training with the new Airbus 350. I also read that Boeing is selling the 787 with a promise of less pilot training, not more. Why the difference?

-- submitted by reader Doy, Virginia

Answer: I think you have an apples-to-oranges comparison. Training for ""Back to Basics"" is available through several different organizations, not exclusively Airbus. It is intended to refresh primary pilot ""stick and rudder"" skills.

The length of training for the 787 depends on a pilot's background. If a pilot has been flying a 777 previously, then there is a compressed training course available due to the similarity in systems and operating procedures. If, however, a pilot had been flying an A330 or an Embraer 170 prior to being assigned to the 787, the training would be longer because the systems and operating procedures are different.

Pilot training is designed to be effective and efficient. A pilot transitioning to an A330 from an A320 may have a shorter training time than a pilot previously flying a B737. The similarities in the A320 and A330 make it possible to shorten the training time while maintaining the effectiveness.

Q: Boeing claims the new 787 Dreamliner has 20% less fuel consumption. How significant is this number?

-- Justin Do

A: The next generation of jets will be more fuel efficient than current ones. With the price of jet fuel increasing, it will make a large difference to the airlines. A 20% improvement is a very large improvement. In the past airlines would hope to gain 4% or 5% with a new technology. The new 787 and upcoming A350 will change the economics of operations.

StarFlyer is a small Japanese low-cost carrier that paints its Airbus A320s with a unique, mostly-black design. I must say it’s striking, and one of the more attractive paint schemes I’ve seen on an A320.

Until recently, those A320s—seven in all—have been leased from GECAS and AWAS. But in late December, StarFlyer took delivery of its first directly purchased Airbus. StarFlyer has two more on order directly from Airbus, and will receive another three from lessors over the next couple of years.

StarFlyer serves four routes with its current fleet, a number that will likely expand once more new planes come online.

Founded in 2002 as Kobe Airlines, StarFlyer adopted its current name in 2003. It’s based at Kitakyushu Airport in Southern Japan. Passenger experience is said to be inspired by that of JetBlue Airways, with seatback TVs at every one of the plane’s 150 seats—a low number to allow for greater legroom.

I think it’s time for a roundup of black airplane liveries. What are your favorites?","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999642014503479}",neutral,0.999642014503479,0

One potential candidate to receive the winglets is a special mission version of the C295, which will carry an Elta Systems-sourced airborne early warning and control mission system. In 2012, Airbus Military conducted aerodynamic test flights of a demonstrator aircraft featuring a fixed rotodome, with the same platform also used for the recent activity.

If proven to be of benefit, winglets could be installed to new-build C295s, and also potentially be offered as a retrofit option to current users of the type. The design is operated by, or on order for, a total of 16 nations, as recorded by Flightglobal's MiliCAS database.

While still trailing Boeing's gross figure of 1,339 the Airbus declaration is far above its original target of 650.

The airframer also delivered 588 aircraft, worth $76 billion, exceeding its mid-year estimate of 580.

Airbus chief operating officer for customers John Leahy says the manufacturer had internally revised its order target during the summer, to ""try to get to 900"".

Leahy adds that, of 140 sales campaigns last year, ""about half worked for Airbus"".

As well as the order for 60 A320-family jets signed on 31 December the total includes three A330-300s, also for an undisclosed customer.

Chief executive Fabrice Brégier says the company ""overachieved"" during 2012, noting the increased production rates for the A320 and A330.

Airbus's net order figure for the year stood at 833 against Boeing's 1,203, giving the European airframer a 41% share of the combined $231 billion in revenues.

The two rivals' total order backlog reached more than 9,000 aircraft with Airbus accounting for 4,682 - the slightly larger share.

But Airbus's A320neo firmly leads the Boeing 737 Max in terms of firm backlog with 62% of the 2,798 orders.

While the A320neo took 478 net orders last year Airbus still managed to sell 261 of the baseline A320 variants.

A320 deliveries rose to 455, a new record for the company.

Twenty-seven A350s and 58 A330s and A340s featured in the net order total although A380 sales dwindled to nine.

Airbus had expected the popularity of the 737 Max to hand Boeing a strong year but Brégier insists he is not disappointed.

""We see we are still enjoying a leading position on the [A320neo] following a small catch-up from Boeing,"" he says. ""We are still on the right track.""

Boeing delivered 13 more jets than Airbus in 2012, a total of 601.

Extended Endurance Could Get C295AEW Back on the Indonesian Radar - Defense Update,"Thu, 03 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTMwMTAzX2MyOTVfYWV3Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Military has begun flight-testing a modification to add winglets to the C295 medium transport and surveillance aircraft – one of a series of product developments underway on the market-leading type.

By increasing the lift-drag ratio the winglets are expected to improve performance in the takeoff, climb and cruise phases of the flight. For the C295 these extensions would contribute to hot and high runway performance, increased range and endurance, and reduced fuel consumption – driving lower operating costs.

The first flight of the wingletted Airborne Early Warning (AEW) configured aircraft took place in Spain on 21 December. Data from the flight test program will help evaluate the potential benefit and feasibility to incorporate winglets into the C295 design.

Extending the mission endurance of this aircraft is considered a critical requirement for Airbus Military, in order to meet the Indonesian Air Force requirement for Airborne Early Warning aircraft. Indonesia is already shopping for such aircraft, and, according to Air Force Chief of Staff ACM Imam Sufaat, larger platforms would be required for the country’s AEW mission, particularly in terms of endurance. It is expected that the improvements gained by those winglets would be sufficient to get the C295 into the game. The Indonesian market is considered a strategic market for the aircraft. In early 2012 Indonesia placed an order for nine C295 aircraft, the first delivered by the end of last year. Airbus Military is also helping its local partner PT Dirgantara Indonesia (PT DI) to modernize its manufacturing facilities to enable local assembly of these planes.

Few months earlier Airbus Military and missile developer MBDA performed flight demonstration of an armed C295 maritime patrol aircraft, carrying an instrumented Marte MK2/S anti-ship inert missile installed under the left wing. The flight was the first of a series of trials planned in a joint Airbus Military – MBDA collaboration to validate the aerodynamic integration of Marte on the C295. Subsequent flights will include handling qualities tests and aircraft flight performance tests. The C295 will be the first fixed-wing aircraft configuration for the missile. Marte Mk2/S is already integrated on the AW-101 and the NFH-90 naval helicopters.

The MBDA Marte MK2/S missile is a fire-and-forget, all-weather, medium-range sea-skimming anti-ship weapon system, equipped with inertial mid-course guidance and radar homing terminal guidance, and capable of destroying small vessels and heavily damaging major vessels. The missile has a weight of 310 Kg and is 3.85 m long.

The Changing Face of Air Travel - INSEAD Knowledge,"Thu, 10 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8va25vd2xlZGdlLmluc2VhZC5lZHUvZWNvbm9taWNzLWZpbmFuY2UvY2hhbmdpbmctZmFjZS1haXItdHJhdmVs0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The menu at this traditional Bavarian restaurant was hard to read, even before the beers. It was all in Chinese. Paulaner’s Bremen on the German North Sea coast has bowed to reality and begun communicating directly with their Chinese guests, at least through their menu.

The number of Chinese tourists visiting Europe is expected to multiply in the coming years as consumers in the Asian country acquire wealth and venture out into the world. According to the European Commission, the number of visa applications in China for travel to Europe surged to 1.03 million annually in 2011 – an 81 percent increase over 2008.

The sharp rise in spending by Chinese and other Asian travellers is fuelling an increase in aircraft orders in the West. “There are three mega markets right now – you’ve got Asia Pacific, the U.S. and Western Europe,” John Leahy, Airbus COO-Customers told INSEAD Knowledge at the Berlin Air Show in September. “But in 20 years that is going to shift dramatically - about a third is going to be in Asia-Pacific, about 20 percent Europe, and only 20 percent in the United States. The biggest market is going to be out there in Asia-Pacific.”

The World Tourism Organization reports international tourism generated a whopping US$1.2 trillion in 2011, with the steepest rate of growth in Southeast Asia. Oddly, the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in 2000, as well as the SARS epidemic and the 2008/9 financial crisis barely impacted the growth rate of international travel, which continues to grow nearly 5 percent each year. The growth of Asian travel also reflects the increase in global trade.

Airbus estimates that airlines in the Asia-Pacific region will take delivery of around 9,370 new aircraft over the next 20 years – a book value of 1.3 trillion dollars. The Brazilian regional jet maker, Embraer, says China alone will need 1005 new short-haul aircraft by 2031 to accommodate the increase in air travel. The sheer potential of the Asian market is an aircraft maker’s dream.

Different market perceptions and different strategies

Airbus is locked in a head-to-head battle with the American Boeing Company for a greater share of the global aerospace market. The two manufacturers sell about 1000 single and double-isle jets each year and have a backlog of several thousand on order. Airbus is a subsidiary of EADS, the European Aeronautic and Defence Systems, and is betting that its new A380 double-decker aircraft, which can carry over 550 passengers, will fill a specific need in Europe. Leahy believes air traffic will continue to double every 15 years, exhausting the capacity of Western airports and flight control. “We can’t keep increasing the number of flights,” insists Leahy. “Flying on business, flying on pleasure, flying back and forth to see our families, that’s going to be done from hub to hub, but those are getting congested today. The only way to do it is with bigger aircraft, more fuel-efficient aircraft, and quieter, more environmentally-friendly aircraft.”

Boeing has a slightly different strategy. It has stretched its 747 jumbos and introduced a smaller aircraft - the Dreamliner - which can carry up to 290 passengers 15,750 km, or slightly more than the distance between London and Singapore. Boeing believes that travellers want non-stop flights to most destinations (the “point-to-point” theory, as opposed to “hub and spoke”). The Dreamliner brings “big-jet ranges to mid-size airplanes” and will consume 20 percent less fuel, Boeing boasts on its website.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.5647041201591492}",positive,0.5647041201591492,1

Airbus stated that the wing-tip devices enabled carriers to reduce fuel burn by up to 4% on long-haul routes.

Sharklets are an optional feature on new-build A320 airliners and are standard on all variants of the A320neo jets.

Made from lightweight composites, the sharklets offer the flexibility of adding about 100nm more range or increasing payload capability of up to 992lbs.

IndiGo president Aditya Ghosh said that the airline already operates most fuel efficient fleet and the investment in Sharklets would help reduce fuel consumption even further.



""Sharklets are an optional feature on new-build A320 airliners and are standard on all variants of the A320neo jets.""

Airbus COO Customers John Leahy said: ""With high fuel prices and with a 4% burn reduction, IndiGo’s investment in the Sharklet will pay handsome dividends.""

In 2005, IndiGo has placed an order for 100 A320 aeroplanes, it received the first A320 aircraft on 28 July 2006.

The airline has also placed a firm order for 150 A320neo and 30 A320s in 2011.

IndiGo operates an all Airbus fleet of 62 A320s and has 280 cumulative orders for Airbus aircraft to date.

Earlier this month, UAE-based Air Arabia and Philippines budget carrier Cebu Pacific Air received the Sharklets-equipped A320.

So far, Airbus has received more than 9,000 orders for A320 jetliners, with 5,400 having already been delivered to more than 380 customers and operators worldwide.

Airbus Military says it expects the deal to be finalised later this year. The decision follows a flight test campaign carried out in India where the aircraft was used to refuel multiple fighter types and also performed operations from high-altitude air bases. The European type had faced competition from the Ilyushin Il-78MK, offered via Russia's Rosoboronexport arms agency.

Domingo Ureña Raso, Airbus Military chief executive, says: ""We are grateful for the confidence shown in our company by the government of India and the Indian air force. This has been a long and tough competition and we are honoured to have been selected."" India had previously selected the company to meet its expanded inflight refuelling requirements, before its selection was overturned by a budget committee, prompting a repeat contest. Local media reports last month suggested that the MRTT had again been selected, but Airbus Military declined to comment on the suggestion at that time.

New Delhi's selection of the A330 MRTT makes it the fifth nation to commit to the type, alongside Australia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the UK, which have previously ordered a combined total of 28 aircraft.

A “New” Airline? Germanwings Unveils an Updated Livery and Product - Airline Reporter,"Tue, 08 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMy8wMS9hLW5ldy1haXJsaW5lLWdlcm1hbndpbmdzLXVudmVpbHMtYW4tdXBkYXRlZC1saXZlcnktYW5kLXByb2R1Y3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Behold Germanwing’s new livery which was recently painted on an Airbus A319 (D-AGWT). The change is more than just a new design; they are altering the way that they do business as well.

Germanwings was founded in 1997 as a German based low-cost airline and in January 2009, they became a subsidiary of Lufthansa Airlines. Germanwings currently operates a fleet of almost 40 Airbus A319 aircraft, but it will soon grow.

Lufthansa will start moving aircraft to the “new” airline and Germanwings fleet will grow to about 90. Germanwings is set to take over all of Lufthansa’s domestic and European, non-hub flights.

Christoph Franz, Chairman of the Executive Board of Deutsche Lufthansa AG stated: ’œWith the ’˜new Germanwings’ we are going on the offensive in respect of point-to-point connections. We have developed a convincing array of products and have many years of experience in the low-cost and premium segments. We will combine elements of both in the ’˜new Germanwings’ and set new standards in our home market of Europe. This will enable us to operate profitably away from our large hubs again while also exciting our passengers with a modern offering.’

On July 1, 2013, the official “new Germanwings” will start operations with only economy seating, but with three types of service (see the chart above).

Lufthansa’s website states, “True to the motto ’œReasonably priced but not cheap’, the airline’s employees will focus all the more on meeting customer’s wishes to the fullest in the future. Passengers will be able to choose from three basic Economy Class modules for this ’“ Best, Smart and Basic.”

The more you pay; the better service you get. Not too difficult.

The new livery is a pretty radical departure from the previous one. It moves to a more conservative look, that mirrors Lufthansa.

As far as European-white liveries, I think this one does quite well. The swooping, colorful “W” on the tail goes well with the titles on the side. I only wish that color would have been added to the winglets, but maybe that would have been a bit too much. Lufthansa has probably one of the most simple, yet regal liveries and probably wanted Germanwings to have a bit more of a “fun” or “cost effective” look, while steering clear of the Spirit Airlines or Wizz Air look.

Indonesian air line Lion Air has ordered over 200 passenger jets from French-based European aircraft builder Airbus, according to reports. Lion Air boss Edward Sirait has indirectly confirmed the news.

Sirait told the AFP wire service on Wednesday that he could not give any details because he was waiting figures and documents from his company’s legal department, a statement the news agency took to be confirmation that the sale is to go ahead.

It was following up a report in the regional newspaper Dépêche du Midi, which, like Airbus, is based in the south-western French city of Toulouse.

“Lion Air is said to have finalised a large order of A320neos before the end of the year [2012],” the paper said on Wednesday, adding that the order may be for as many as 220 planes.

Airbus will publish its annual sales figures on 17 January.

Last year Lion Air placed a record order with Boeing, for 239 737s and until now most of its fleet has been built by Airbus’s US competitor.

The company needs planes for its expansion plans, which include a low-cost airline in Malaysia to rival its main regional competitor, AirAsia.

Lion Air was founded in 2009 and is now Indonesia’s largest private airline, mainly operating in its home country but also in Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam and Saudi Arabia.

The aircraft, the first two on firm contract and a further six on options to be progressively confirmed in the coming years, were formally handed over in Sevilla before the ferry flights, via Astana, to Almaty, where they will be based.

They were earlier technically accepted in Seville by a combined team of Kazspetsexport, the Kazakhstan Ministry of Defence, and the Kazakhstan Air Forces.

Both aircraft will be used in support of transport missions throughout the nationÂ´s vast territory. The purchase contract additionally covers the related service support package for spare parts and ground support equipment.

Airbus Military senior vice-president commercial, Antonio Rodríguez-Barberán, said: We greatly appreciate the high level of professionalism and strong commitment shown by the relevant Kazakh institutions in ensuring the smooth and mutually rewarding execution of this agreement. It is a great pleasure to welcome the Air Forces of Kazakhstan into the worldwide family of C295 operators and we are committed to providing the required level of support for our new customer for many years to come.

Airbus Military has also received an order for six additional C295 transport aircraft from the Egyptian Air Force, bringing the Egyptian Air Force’s C295 fleet to a total of 12 aircraft. This third batch of aircraft plus the associated spares and support equipment, training and field support are to be delivered from the end of 2013 onwards.

The Egyptian Air Force selected the C295 because of its proven versatility, robustness and efficiency for its daily transport missions combined with the ease of maintenance and low cost of operations.

This order reinforces the C295’s position as the best-selling airlifter in this category, with a total of 121 C295s sold to 17 operators. Seven of them have placed repeat orders for C295 aircraft, confirming the trust our customers place in the aircraft for medium airlift. With more than 90 aircraft in service today in 15 countries, the C295 has accumulated more than 120,000 flying hours in the most demanding conditions, from extreme cold weather to hot desert areas.

A repeat order from a loyal customer is extremely valued by Airbus Military and the trust that the Ministry of Defence of Egypt is placing in us confirms that we offer a product that responds to our customer’s needs. We will ensure that we live up to this mark of confidence and stand by our customer as a trusted partner for many years to come, said Antonio Rodríguez Barberán, Airbus Military senior vice-president, commercial. The C295 is exactly the kind of workhorse required for current and future airlift missions, and the most cost-efficient complement to heavy transport aircraft.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9806644916534424}",neutral,0.9806644916534424,0

Deliveries during the calendar year comprised 20 aircraft in the light and medium transport category, which spans the C212, CN235 and C295, plus five A330 multirole tanker transports (MRTT) and four upgraded Lockheed Martin P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft. The company is modernising the Brazilian air force's fleet of the latter type to the AM-standard.

Airbus Military has, meanwhile, also made a strong business start to 2013, having so far announced the receipt of contracts to produce a combined seven C295s for Colombia and Egypt, while two have already been delivered to the Kazakhstan air force. The company's A330 MRTT also has been formally selected to meet an Indian air force requirement for six tankers, with a contract signature expected later in the year.

The first series production example of the A400M Atlas is also on track for delivery to launch operator the French air force during the second quarter of 2013, with the service and Turkey to receive a further three of the transports before year-end. Another 13 are already in various stages of production, Airbus says.

Airbus says its military unit's orders backlog totals 220 aircraft: 174 A400Ms; 20 C295s; 17 A330 MRTTs; five CN235s; and four more upgraded P-3s.

Planes Collide in Miami and F-15’s Are Sent to Escort an Alaska Airline’s Flight - Airline Reporter,"Fri, 18 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMy8wMS9hbGFza2EtZXNjb3J0LWYxNS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thursday 17th January saw two events in aviation that normally would have made headlines, but with all the Boeing 787 issues and American revealing their new livery, these two interesting events have been overshadowed.

The first event to happen in Miami at approximately 545pm EST when an Airbus A340 flown by Aerolineas Argentinas touched down after flying from Buenos Aires. As it was taxiing to the gate it collided with an Air France 777-300 preparing to depart for Paris.

BONUS: The NYDailyNews has a photo of the two aircraft

The collision caused damage to the tail and wingtips of the aircraft. Emergency crews showed up, but thankfully no injuries occurred. Those passengers on the arriving aircraft were allowed to disembark, however the Air France passengers were unable to depart for Paris.

On the opposite side of the country, around 6:00pm PST, two F15Cs of the Oregon Air National Guard were scrambled from their base at Portland International Airport. The two jets from the 142 Fighter Wing were sent to escort Alaska Airlines flight 819, a Boeing 737, from Kona Hawaii to Seattle.

A hijacking threat had been made against the flight and the passenger involved in the threat was monitored by crew. Alaska Airlines told AirlineRepoter.com that, “This passenger did not display any unusual behavior and was asleep much of the flight.”

Officials made the decision to escort the aircraft into Seattle and the flight touched down in Seattle at 707pm PST where they were greeted by the TSA and the Port of Seattle Police. According to KING5 News, the FBI interviewed the passenger for approximately two hours and FBI Spokesperson Ayn Dietrich said that they do not anticipate an arrest. Turns out that the passenger was cooperative and the investigation will now look into who called in the possible hoax or practical joke.

Billionaire Arab Prince Buys Planet’s Largest Private Jet - Green Prophet,"Mon, 21 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVucHJvcGhldC5jb20vMjAxMy8wMS9iaWxsaW9uYWlyZS1hcmFiLXByaW5jZS1idXlzLXBsYW5ldHMtbGFyZ2VzdC1wcml2YXRlLWpldC_SAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ncmVlbnByb3BoZXQuY29tLzIwMTMvMDEvYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtYXJhYi1wcmluY2UtYnV5cy1wbGFuZXRzLWxhcmdlc3QtcHJpdmF0ZS1qZXQvP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

Look! Up in the sky! Is it an office complex? A concert hall? A Turkish bath? Or a parking garage? No, it’s the new ride of an Arab prince – a King-sized jet – one that could hold 800 people. Will you step aboard this airborne greenhouse gas factory?

Stuffed inside the fuselage of Prince Alwaleed bin Talal al-Saud’s new Airbus A380 is all that and more; civil aviation’s largest aircraft transformed in an obscene manifestation of wealth and environmental frivolity. It begs the question, just because you can do it – should you? Call the guys at Guinness World Records back to the Middle East: the Saudi billionaire’s newest toy will be the planet’s biggest private jet.

To add some perspective, this is an aircraft used commercially by Emirates airlines to ferry 800 passengers in a single flight, a jumbo plane that can fly 8,000 miles without refueling.

Although Emirates’ version boasts in-flight showers (to freshen up, say, if you spilt your cocktail and hors d’oeuvres whilst exchanging bon mots in the posh onboard lounges), its swanky service pales in comparison to what the Prince will offer.

Airbus will deliver a stripped-down plane and then the Prince will unleash his own designers for the fabulous fit-out. His $385 million acquisition will ultimately hold 20 state rooms and a marble-lined spa including a Turkish bath.

The floor and walls of a “well-being room” act as giant movie screen, displaying views of earth’s surface as the plane flies over. Here passengers can stand on a “magic carpet” and watch their journey progress, scented breezes blowing into the room. There’s a state-of-the-art concert hall too.

On landing, the royal’s guests will experience what interior designer Design Q calls an “Oscar” moment: a special lift descends from the belly of the plane onto an automatically unfurling red carpet. No jostling for overhead luggage before joining the exiting conga line for these folks.

But it’s not all pleasure palace: there’s a business center and board room and a dedicated prayer room where “virtual” (computer-generated and GPS-based) prayer mats rotate continually for an accurate pointing to Mecca.

The Middle East’s major carriers, such as Etihad and Qatar Airways, have undertaken to reduce aviation emissions from their ground operations and in flight (in 2012, Etihad became the first Gulf carrier to fly on biofuels). Others, such as EgyptAir, contribute to the International Air Transport Association’s carbon offset program, part of the United Nations’ Clean Development Mechanism (investing airline receive credits to apply against their corporate carbon footprint. On an individual level, conscientious fliers can offset their personal carbon footprints by buying into airline offset programs like the one offered by Qatar Airways.

Imagine the carbon tab for the privileged few passengers aboard this airborne greenhouse gas factory. Then ponder the wondrous results if its design team (and exhorbitant project budget) had instead been tasked with achieving sustainable excellence.

Design Q told the Daily Mail that the aircraft is, “not only the most luxurious aircraft in existence, but also reflects the cultural values and status of its owner.”

The late Elizabeth Taylor once quipped, “Money is the best deodorant”.

I do think this sort of excess stinks.

Airbus says in lead for Indian air refuelling tanker contract | Mint - Mint,"Tue, 08 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9Db21wYW5pZXMvcDlSQ1h3TU5vTmZSbjhPazdFbm9MSi9BaXJidXMtc2F5cy1pbi1wb2xlLXBvc2l0aW9uLWZvci1JbmRpYW4tYWlyLXJlZnVlbGxpbmctdGFua2UuaHRtbNIBhQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vQ29tcGFuaWVzL3A5UkNYd01Ob05mUm44T2s3RW5vTEovQWlyYnVzLXNheXMtaW4tcG9sZS1wb3NpdGlvbi1mb3ItSW5kaWFuLWFpci1yZWZ1ZWxsaW5nLXRhbmtlLmh0bWw_ZmFjZXQ9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris: European aircraft manufacturer Airbus SAS said Monday that it has won a tender to supply India with six A330 air refuelling tankers, a deal potentially worth more than $1 billion (€770 million).

“Airbus Military is pleased to confirm that it has been selected by the government of India as the preferred bidder to supply its A330 MRTT (multi-role tanker transport) to the Indian Air Force (IAF),"" an Airbus statement said.

A spokesman for Airbus Military, the group’s defence division, declined to comment on the deal’s value, which would have a catalogue price of $1.25-1.38 billion.

Airbus still has a way to go before it can take a signed contract to the bank however, as the development opened the door to a long process of negotiations between Delhi and the aircraft manufacturer.

As an example, the French company Dassault Aviation was chosen by India in January 2012 to supply 126 Rafale combat jets, but that deal has yet to be finalized.

Airbus Military chief executive Domingo Urena Raso was quoted as saying: “We are fully committed to the next stage of the negotiations, and ultimately to providing the IAF with what is unquestionably the most advanced tanker/transport aircraft flying and certified today.""

Airbus had already won a contract to build air refuelling tankers for India, but that deal was cancelled owing to irregularities in the tender process.

This time around, Airbus was competing head-to-head with the Russian group Ilyushin, which has already supplied aircraft to India.

If the Airbus contract with India is finalized, it would mark the sixth country to buy or say it will buy the tankers.

The others are Australia, Britain, France, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.

An industry source said India might need many more than just six of the planes, meanwhile.

The A330 MRTT can supply two aircraft with fuel at the same time, and in the configuration now being used by the Australian air force, can carry 111 tonnes of fuel, 37 tonnes of material and 270 passengers.

The deal would be a welcome fillip to Airbus, which suffered a bitter defeat in the US almost two years ago when arch rival Boeing Co. won a US Air Force contract for 179 air refuelling tankers.

New Delhi, Jan 8: The Indian Air Force (IAF) has selected the Airbus Military A330 MRTT Multi Role Tanker Transport for its next generation of midair refuelling tankers.

In a statement released here late Monday, the European company announced that ""detailed negotiations"" would now begin for ""the award of a final production contract for an envisaged six aircraft"".The decision follows a lengthy and thorough selection process including the completion of extensive flight demonstrations in India by the A330 MRTT during which the aircraft refuelled multiple types of IAF fighters and operated from the high-altitude IAF base at Leh, it said.IAF sources told India Strategic magazine that the twin-engine MRTT was found to be cheaper in overall costs against its competitor, the RussianIL 78 MIDAS.The Airbus Military aircraft was also a much modern machine in comparison, easy to fly with a fighter-like joystick and also easy to change in configuration from a refueller to a transporter.The Airbus Military MRTT had been selected earlier also but the Indian finance ministry did not accord approval as the company demanded an extra sum for a requirement that the government considered inappropriate.In the re-tender, it has won again.The official estimated value of the project is Rs.8,500 crore ($1.55 billion at current conversion rate).Negotiations for a formal contract should begin within this financial year, by March 2013, and hopefully end by the end of calendar year 2013, India Strategic reported.IAF has six IL 78 refuellers, designated MARS or Mid Air Refuelling System at present.They are built on older Il 76 platforms, which are actually not made any more.Their engines consume too much fuel too. Russia is likely to introduce a newer version of the IL 76 some time in 2014 but then that means a different timeline for production for delivery.The choice of the Airbus Military 330 was made in November after an assessment of the operating costs and life cycle costs.Both the Airbus and Il 76 qualified though on technical grounds. Only the announcement though has been made now.Airbus Military CEO Domingo Urena Raso said: ""We are grateful for the confidence shown in our company by the Government of India and the Indian Air Force.""India´s selection of the A330 MRTT makes it the fifth nation to commit to the type following Australia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Britain which have ordered a total of 28 aircraft.The Airbus statement said MRTT can also be used as a pure transporter to carry 300 troops or a payload of up to 45 tonnes or to accommodate up to 130 stretchers for medical evacuation.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999675750732422}",neutral,0.9999675750732422,0

Sharklets are an option of all new build Airbus A320’s, and will be standard on the upcoming Airbus A320NEO. They stand a a rather high 2.4 meters tall, made from composites.

Airbus estimate that these sharklets will cut fuel consumpsion by 4% – and over a lifetime of a plane, that’s a lot of money in fuel. In addtion the modification will allow a range increase of 100 Nautical Miles or an extra payload capacity pf 450kg .

These little actions all add up.

Air Asia is a very big A320 customer with a total order list so far of 475 aircraft, with over 100 delivered to the airline.

a first officer on a Boeing 767 aircraft between 1996 and 1999;

a first officer on an Airbus 340 aircraft in 1999;

a captain on a Boeing 767 aircraft between 2000 and 2010; and

a captain on an Airbus 330 aircraft between 2010 and 2011.

""While serving as a crewmember on DC-9, Boeing 767 and Airbus 330 and 340 aircraft, the plaintiff was exposed to toxic chemicals that escaped the aircraft engines and entered the cabin through environmental control systems,"" Zaharik alleges in his notice of civil claim.

""The toxic chemicals that the plaintiff was exposed to … included tricresyl phosphate and other organophosphates and neurotoxins originating from hot engine oil and hydraulic fluid.""

Zaharik alleges that there were five ""toxic fume events"" in late 2010 and January 2011, which occurred when he was piloting Airbus 330 aircraft between Calgary and London, England.

These exposures allegedly led to significant neurological damage and other personal injuries including:

hearing loss;

respiratory impairment; and

headaches, among many other conditions.

He is seeking damages and costs.

"Airbus seen posting 900 orders, 580 deliveries for 2012 - defenceWeb","Mon, 07 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuY2V3ZWIuY28uemEvYWVyb3NwYWNlL2Flcm9zcGFjZS1hZXJvc3BhY2UvYWlyYnVzLXNlZW4tcG9zdGluZy05MDAtb3JkZXJzLTU4MC1kZWxpdmVyaWVzLWZvci0yMDEyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus looks set to post sales of around 900 aircraft for 2012 and exceed its target of 580 deliveries after a record month in December, a Reuters analysis of industry figures shows.

A late surge in both orders and deliveries by the European firm was not enough to prevent Boeing regaining aviation’s top spot in both sales and deliveries for 2012, but will likely put EADS unit Airbus ahead of its own targets.

Airbus and Boeing compete fiercely for control of the $100 billion jetliner market.

The European company had already conceded defeat as Boeing caught up with demand for revamped narrowbody jets in 2012, following a record lead by Airbus in the previous year, Reuters reports.

But industry sources have said Airbus internally mounted a concerted effort to keep a market share of 40 percent, considered the lowest sustainable share in a duopoly such as the one it enjoys with Boeing, and is confident of reaching this.

Airbus declined to comment ahead of an annual presentation in Toulouse on January 17.

Boeing earlier reported 1,339 plane orders in 2012, its best result since 2007.

Airbus would need to have sold around 900 aircraft in 2012 to reach its market share goal, suggesting as yet unreported orders for some 180 aircraft.

The figure tallies with market indications of brisk activity in December, though this was not enough to close the gap between Airbus and its U.S. rival for the year as a whole.

Airbus had sold 646 planes by the end of November and reported a further 75 during December, though the rest of that month’s tally has not yet been published.

Airbus officially targets 650 orders for 2012.

Although Airbus exceeded its overall gross order target for 2012, it fell short of a specific target of 30 orders for the A380 superjumbo.

Questions also remain over its ability to reach an unpublished target, first reported by Reuters, of 300 current-generation A320s as airlines prefer newer fuel-saving models.

Deliveries also quickened sharply in December due to a backlog of planes, including A380 superjumbos held back for repairs following wing cracks identified early in 2012.

Based on third-party estimates and deliveries announced during December but not yet included in the official tally, Airbus looks likely to have exceeded its previous monthly record of 61 and could slightly exceed its 2012 target of 580 aircraft.

Aerospace analyst Scott Hamilton said Airbus was expected to have delivered around 580 aircraft in 2012.

Boeing earlier reported 601 deliveries in 2012 including 15 in a single 24-hour period in December, putting it on course to regain the crown as the world’s largest planemaker for the first time in a decade.

BOC Aviation says ordering 50 Airbus A320s - SKNVibes.com,"Tue, 15 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHA6Ly93d3cuc2tudmliZXMuY29tL25ld3MvbmV3c2RldGFpbHMuY2ZtLzY4MzUz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Singapore, SGP) - China-owned plane-leasing company BOC Aviation said it has ordered 50 Airbus aircraft of the medium-haul A320 family, including 25 of the more fuel-efficient ""neos"".

The statement did not disclose the value of the deal, but price tags in the 2012 catalogue ranged from $4.41 billion (3.3 billion euros) for 50 classic A320s to $5.66 billion for 50 A321neos.

Customers placing large orders, however, are typically able to secure substantial discounts on the list price.

BOC Aviation said an announcement on the exact make-up of the order, which is scheduled for delivery between the second half of 2014 and the end of 2019, would be made later.

The order was the first by BOC Aviation for Airbus's new engine option.

Robert Martin, BOC Aviation's managing director and chief executive officer, said the firm was keen to offer its clients the latest energy efficient aircraft, explaining the presence of the new neo engine option in the order.

The A320neo series is designed to reduce emissions and cut fuel consumption by up to 15 percent.

""The announcement from BOC Aviation is another vote of confidence in the long-term appeal of our popular A320 Family,"" said John Leahy, Airbus's chief operating officer -- customers.

The company said that to date, more than 8,800 aircraft from the A320 series have been ordered and some 5,300 delivered to 380 customers and operators worldwide.

The plane competes with Boeing's 737 airliner, of which a 737 MAX version is scheduled for launch in 2017.

Airbus said last week that Irish aircraft leasing group Avolon had confirmed an order for 20 A320neo jets.

And on Monday it said that Citilink, the low-cost branch of Indonesian airline Garuda, had ordered 25 A320neo aircraft.

Airbus is to release its annual results on Thursday, and sector analysts said this week they expected the company to unveil additional orders before then.

In early December, the European aircraft manufacturer said it had received a net number of orders, after accounting for cancellations, for 585 planes last year up to November 30.

Meanwhile Boeing reported a total of 1,203 net orders last year.

BOC Aviation, which is owned by the Bank of China but based in Singapore, owns or manages 203 aircraft operated by airlines worldwide with another 100 planes on firm order.

The firm says it has one of the youngest fleets in the industry with an average aircraft age of less than four years.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999842643737793}",neutral,0.9999842643737793,0
Airbus to provide tactical transport Aircraft to Afghan army - The Khaama Press News Agency,"Fri, 18 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtoYWFtYS5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXRvLXByb3ZpZGUtdGFjdGljYWwtdHJhbnNwb3J0LWFpcmNyYWZ0LXRvLWFmZ2hhbi1hcm15LTIxMjIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"According to reports, Airbus Military is holding talks with the US officials to provide troop-transport aircraft for the Afghan national army.

This comes as Pentagon recently decided to scrap a contract to use planes built by Finmeccanica SpA.

Domingo Urena-Raso Chief Executive Officer of Airbus Military said the discussions include provision of CN235s ad large C295s aircraft.

The Pentagon late last year said it would not extend a contract with Finmeccanica’s Alenia Aermacchi to provide 20 G222 cargo turbo-propeller aircraft to the Afghan forces, citing reliability concerns, Bloomberg reported. Alenia, with its C-27 that replaced the G222, and Airbus Military dominate the market for small military transport planes.

Airbus Military CEO Urena-Raso said Airbus won 75 percent of light transport plane orders last year. It booked deals for 28 C295s and four CN235s last year.

Sales of smaller planes will dominate also this year even as the company ramps up export efforts for the A400M Atlas, Europe’s largest airlifter, he said. The first A400M is scheduled to go to the French Air Force in the second quarter.

“We are now in the phase when we are switching from A400M development to production,” Urena-Raso quoted by Bloomberg said. Airbus expects to hand over four A400Ms this year, three to France and one to the Turkish air force. It plans to produce 10 aircraft next year and 21 in 2015.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9976194500923157}",neutral,0.9976194500923157,0
Airbus wins Indian air refuelling tanker contract - SKNVibes.com,"Mon, 07 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNrbnZpYmVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ld3NkZXRhaWxzLmNmbS82ODA0MNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Paris, FRA) - European aircraft manufacturer Airbus said Monday that it has won a tender to supply India with six A330 air refuelling tankers, a deal potentially worth more than $1.0 billion (770 million euros).

""Airbus Military is pleased to confirm that it has been selected by the Government of India as the preferred bidder to supply its A330 MRTT Multi Role Tanker Transport to the Indian Air Force,"" an Airbus statement said.

A spokesman for Airbus Military, the group's defence division, declined to comment on the deal's value, which would have a catalogue price of $1.25-1.38 billion.

Airbus still has a way to go before it can take a signed contract to the bank however, as the development opened the door to a long process of negotiations between Delhi and the aircraft manufacturer.

As an example, the French company Dassault Aviation was chosen by India in January 2012 to supply 126 Rafale combat jets, but that deal has yet to be finalised.

Airbus Military chief executive Domingo Urena Raso was quoted as saying: ""We are fully committed to the next stage of the negotiations, and ultimately to providing the IAF with what is unquestionably the most advanced tanker/transport aircraft flying and certified today.""

Airbus had already won a contract to build air refuelling tankers for India, but that deal was cancelled owing to irregularities in the tender process.

This time around, Airbus was competing head-to-head with the Russian group Ilyushin, which has already supplied aircraft to India.

If the Airbus contract with India is finalised, it would mark the sixth country to buy or say it will buy the tankers.

The others are Australia, Britain, France, United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia.

An industry source said that India might need many more than just six of the planes, meanwhile.

The A330 MRTT (multirole tanker transport) can supply two aircraft with fuel at the same time, and in the configuration now being used by the Australian air force, can carry 111 tonnes of fuel, 37 tonnes of material and 270 passengers.

The deal would be a welcome fillip to Airbus, which suffered a bitter defeat in the United States almost two years ago when arch rival Boeing won a US Air Force contract for 179 air refuelling tankers.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999030828475952}",neutral,0.9999030828475952,0

Turkish Airlines to buy over 100 narrow-body planes| Gulf Times - Gulf Times,"Thu, 24 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmd1bGYtdGltZXMuY29tL3N0b3J5LzMzOTcwOC90dXJraXNoLWFpcmxpbmVzLXRvLWJ1eS1vdmVyLTEwMC1uYXJyb3ctYm9keS1wbGFuZXPSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5ndWxmLXRpbWVzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS8zMzk3MDgvdHVya2lzaC1haXJsaW5lcy10by1idXktb3Zlci0xMDAtbmFycm93LWJvZHktcGxhbmVzL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"﻿﻿

Reuters/Istanbul



Turkish Airlines, the world’s fastest-growing carrier, plans to order more than 100 narrow-body planes by the end of March, underlining its position as a key client for global plane makers after buying billions of dollars’ worth of larger models in 2012.

Chairman Hamdi Topcu told Reuters the airline would finalise five new Airbus A330-300 orders this week on top of the 35 wide-body aircraft ordered from rivals Airbus and Boeing last year, then focus on expanding its fleet of smaller planes.

“I cannot give an exact number for the narrow-body plane orders, but it will very likely be over 100. We aim to finalise this order by the end of March,” Topcu said in an interview in his office in Istanbul.

Industry sources had said Turkey’s flag carrier was expected to seek a large number of narrow-body jets, such as the 150-seat Airbus A320, this year after ordering larger models in 2012.

French Trade Minister Nicole Bricq used an official visit to Turkey this month to press Airbus’ case for the business.

“We ordered 20 Boeing 777-300 and 15 Airbus A330-300 (last year). We want them as soon as possible and are in talks to add five more (A330s) to this order. We aim to finalise it this week,” Topcu said.

Turkish Airlines finalised an order worth $4.7bn at list prices for 15 Boeing 777-300ER aircraft last month, the biggest order by value in the airline’s history, and which the US plane maker said at the time included options for a further five of the 365-seat aircraft.

Turkish Airlines also announced in October that it would buy 15 Airbus A330-300 planes between 2014 and 2016.

After launching 33 new destinations in 2012, the carrier hopes to open as many as 40 new routes in 2013, around a quarter of them to Africa, and will be flying to every country in Europe by the end of the year, Topcu said.

The carrier, which aims to have 219 aircraft in its fleet by the end of the year from a current 202, plans to lease seven planes until the delivery of the ordered aircraft, Topcu said.

“In our fleet projection we will have over 350 planes in 2023, and this number could be even 380,” Topcu said.

The company, 49% owned by the government with the remainder floated on the Istanbul stock exchange, is considering issuing a bond to finance its expansion, he said.

But he said a secondary public offering for the airline was not currently on the government’s agenda.

Topcu said Turkish Airlines was open to closer ties with Lufthansa, but that there were currently no firm plans.

“We are ready for any such cooperations ... but there is no board decision taken,” he said. “If the model to be formed is going to be beneficial for both companies, we are open to any kind of talks.”

Turkish Airlines and Lufthansa have been working together for some time, bolstered by Germany’s large Turkish population, the pair’s membership of the Star Alliance marketing venture and a 50-50 joint venture in charter carrier SunExpress.

Speculation about plans for closer ties between the two airlines was triggered in November when Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said he had discussed the issue with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Analysts have said any new cooperation could involve a deeper code share agreement, a new joint venture on routes where cost savings could be achieved, or in the longer term a potential equity swap.

“Before any co-operation with Lufthansa we have to investigate the Turkish, German and EU legal and regulatory framework. This is going to be one of the most important aspects,” Topcu said.

MANILA, Philippines - Clark International Airport became part of aviation history yesterday when the worldâ€™s first Airbus A320 with Sharklets operated by AirAsia Berhad Malaysia landed at 10:30 a.m. carrying 180 passengers from low cost carrier terminal in Kuala Lumpur.

â€œWe are honored to be part of a history that enables people to move and connect via modern and efficient way. AirAsiaâ€™s state-of-the-art and environment-friendly aircraft will certainly redefine air travel experience in the country and in our neighbouring countries in Asia,â€ CIAC president and CEO Victor Jose Luciano said.

For her part, AirAsia Inc. CEO Maan Hontiveros said: â€œAt AirAsia, we always believe in embracing technological advancements. These new wing tip devices installed in our Airbus A320 will contribute to fulfilling our goal of being the most efficient, innovative low cost airline in the world. More important, these new Airbus A320 with Sharklets aircraft will enable savings of four percent in fuel consumption, corresponding to an annual carbon reduction of around 1,000 tons per aircraft.â€

The newly designed wing-tip devices of Airbus A320 with Sharklets reduce fuel burn and emissions by improving the aerodynamics of the aircraft significantly. In addition, the Sharklets offers the flexibility of either adding around 100 nautical miles more range or allowing increased payload capability of up to 450 kilograms.

â€œThis advancement will also put AirAsia ahead of the competition as we continue to be the frontrunners in the aviation industry â€“ in line with AirAsiaâ€™s rapid expansion plans to grow throughout the Asian region.â€ Hontiveros added.

AirAsia recently placed a new order of 100 more Airbus A320 aircraft including 36 A320ceo aircraft with Sharklets. Altogether, AirAsia has ordered 475 single aisle aircraft from Airbus, comprising 264 A320neo and 211 A320ceo. In 2013 alone, through combination of firms, Airbus deliveries and leases â€“ AirAsia Malaysia will take delivery of 10 aircraft, AirAsia Thailand â€“ eight, AirAsia Indonesia â€“ nine aircraft, Philippinesâ€™ AirAsia â€“ three aircraft and AirAsia Japan â€“ four aircraft.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9949500560760498}",positive,0.9949500560760498,1
