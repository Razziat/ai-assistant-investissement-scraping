City, state and federal representatives (Republicans and Democrats alike) came together with one goal: Show the Airbus team that Alabama would be its partner for the long term.

They spoke with one voice, which impressed our selection committees. And when the U.S. tanker project was lost, instead of hanging their heads and walking away, they said, ""What else could we do?"" It was indicative of the good relationship Airbus has with Mobile and Alabama—instead of giving up, we found another way to make it work. As a result, Alabama got an even better, larger-impact project.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9987146854400635}",positive,0.9987146854400635,1

Eurocopter to be rebranded as Airbus Helicopters - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 31 Jul 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvZXVyb2NvcHRlci10by1iZS1yZWJyYW5kZWQtYXMtYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Beginning next year, the helicopter manufacturer Eurocopter will be rebranded as Airbus Helicopters, part of a wider rebranding effort by parent company EADS.

EADS — originally European Aeronautic, Defense and Space Company — announced on July 31 that it would be restructuring the group and abandoning the EADS name in favor of its globally recognized Airbus brand. The group’s Airbus division will remain responsible for commercial airplane activities, while a new Airbus Defence & Space division will consolidate its Airbus Military, Astrium and Cassidian brands. Eurocopter will be rebranded as Airbus Helicopters and will continue to oversee the group’s commercial and military helicopter activities.

Implementation is planned to start on Jan. 1, 2014, with completion in the second half of 2014. EADS said it will communicate further details in the fourth quarter of 2013.

“What we are unveiling today is an evolution, not a revolution. It’s the next logical step in the development of our company,” said EADS CEO Tom Enders. “We affirm the predominance of commercial aeronautics in our group and we restructure and focus our defense and space activities to take costs out, increase profitability and improve our market position. The renaming simply gathers the entire company under the best brand we have, one that stands for internationalization, innovation and integration — and also for some two thirds of our revenues. It reinforces the message that ‘we make things fly.’”

The announcement came as EADS shared its half-year financial results, which were buoyed by strong performance at Airbus. Airbus’ consolidated revenues increased to € 18,924 million (compared to € 17,525 million in the first half of 2012) amid increased commercial and military aircraft deliveries. In the first six months of 2013, Airbus Commercial recorded 722 net aircraft orders, dramatically higher than the 230 net orders recorded in the first half of 2012.

The strong performance at Airbus offset declines at Eurocopter, where revenues fell by 7 percent to € 2,584 million (compared to € 2,771 million in the first half of 2012) as deliveries declined to 190 helicopters (down from 198 in the first half of 2012). The division’s Earnings Before Interest and Tax declined by 35 percent to € 128 million (from € 198 million in the first half of 2012).

EADS said that flight restrictions for the EC225 Super Puma weighed strongly on Eurocopter’s operational performance in the first half of 2013, as expected. However, the outlook for the Super Puma is improving now that the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and Civil Aviation Authorities of the UK and Norway have officially approved the prevention and detection solutions developed by Eurocopter to prevent a recurrence of the bevel gear vertical shaft cracking that caused two EC225s to ditch in the North Sea in October 2012. Eurocopter is currently supporting helicopter operators in returning their fleets back to service.

In the first six months of 2013, Eurocopter booked 167 net orders (down from 195 net orders in the first half of 2012). At the end of June 2013, the division’s order book was worth € 12.8 billion comprising 1,047 helicopters, down slightly from the 1,070 helicopters on the order book at the end of 2012.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9996107220649719}",positive,0.9996107220649719,1

European aerospace giant EADS on Wednesday unveiled plans to change its name to Airbus, after the civil aviation division that accounts for over 70% of its sales, amid a global corporate restructuring. It also announced rising profits.

European aerospace group EADS is to change its name to Airbus and shake up its corporate structure as part of push to give its civil aviation division more prominence.

As well as the name change next year, European Aeronautic Defense and Space Co. will reshuffle its space and military units into one division, the company said Wednesday. It also unveiled a 31 percent increase in first-half net profits on the same time last year to 759 million euros ($1 billion).

EADS says the changes will “enhance integration and cohesion” of the 13-year-old group formed from the French, German and Spanish aerospace companies.

In the first half, the Airbus unit took in 722 net orders in the first half, up from 230 a year earlier. The civil aircraft business still accounts for almost 70 percent of EADS’ group sales.

EADS had once sought to become less dependent on its civil aircraft business with a goal of growing its defense business, maker of the A400M European freighter, to around half of total revenue. Those plans were shelved with the global economic downturn and government belt-tightening.

Under its new organization, a new defense entity will be created dubbed Airbus Defense & Space, housing the existing military business along with satellite maker Astrium and drone and electronics business Cassidian.

The Eurocopter civil and military helicopter business remains separate in the new organization but is renamed Airbus Helicopters.

EADS chief executive Tom Enders called the changes “an evolution, not a revolution.”

“We affirm the predominance of commercial aeronautics in our group and we restructure and focus our defense and space activities to take costs out, increase profitability and improve our market position,” Enders said in the statement.

Airbus delivered 295 civilian planes in the first half, just less than the 306 record by arch-rival Boeing. At last month’s Paris Air Show, Airbus took in firm orders for 241 aircraft including 65 for its A350 widebody.

The A350 is still undergoing testing, but is expected to enter into service in the first half of next year. It made its first fly-by over Le Bourget air field during the air show last month. On Wednesday EADS said the program “is now entering the most critical phase” and that it “remains challenging.”

“Any schedule change could lead to an increasingly higher impact on provisions,” EADS said.

Why Test Experts are so Important: Lessons from Boeing and Airbus | 2013-07-01 - Assembly Magazine,"Mon, 01 Jul 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzc2VtYmx5bWFnLmNvbS9ibG9ncy8xNC1hc3NlbWJseS1ibG9nL3Bvc3QvOTEzNTItd2h5LXRlc3QtZXhwZXJ0cy1hcmUtc28taW1wb3J0YW50LWxlc3NvbnMtZnJvbS1ib2VpbmctYW5kLWFpcmJ1c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When you take a product like a commercial jetliner and spread the supplier base all over the world, many are quick to blame quality control failures on far-flung logistics. Charred batteries in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and cracked brackets on superjumbo Airbus wings quickly drew critics who said outsourcing doomed the planes.

Many say the aerospace industry cannot use widespread supply chain models like those in the automotive industry. I say a better approach to vendor partnerships would have made all the difference for these companies.

When it comes to testing, every company in the world has the same choices to make, the same risks to avoid. If mission-critical parts fail, customer flight is almost certain. Ironically, in the aerospace industry, when batteries smoke and wing brackets crack, flight is not even an option either literally or figuratively. About the only thing you can count on is delays and lost sales.

Automotive companies have a slightly different dynamic. Other suppliers may quickly step in if a competitor has a leaky engine cover. It’s the same with medical device manufacturers and industrial equipment OEMs—they must either meet specifications or go home. (The aerospace industry is by no means the only industry with exacting standards.)

The root cause of problems for Boeing and Airbus really has more to do with untested technology than supply chain logistics. Boeing engineers in Chicago can meet online with colleagues from Beijing and share CAD files throughout the design phase. French engineers and their colleagues around the world use the same, top-of-the-line CAD software for their collaborative designs at Airbus.

For example, when a big customer demands quieter engines so the A380 can operate near major cities, Airbus is motivated to help. Rest assured, Airbus uses the best software to simulate stress on wing brackets to see if they will hold up with heavier (but less noisy) engines.

Boeing also uses top-of-the-line simulation to test the capabilities of new, lightweight lithium-ion batteries. These batteries help make Boeing jets gas sippers that are more economical to operate. In fact, these batteries are a factor that makes it conceivable for a modern commercial aircraft to fly across oceans with only two engines instead of four. That is potentially a game changer within current FAA standards.

Throughout the aerospace industry, simulation is used extensively. Then test flights start and the real problems begin. Brackets fail. Batteries catch fire. What happened?

For one thing, you need a testing specialist who understands not only test technology but also the demands placed on your product under real-world conditions.

Another important consideration is trust and partnership. A supplier and its testing group is assured better results if they have mutual access to the entire test chain from product development to durability to production testing. Early engagement of test engineers means problems are identified before design is frozen so that costs are controlled.

There was a lot of excellent simulation and lab work to test parts and components before the 787 and the A380 got off the ground. Management at these companies will tell you that testing was probably the most thorough part of the process. Despite all their preflight efforts, in actual flights critical systems failed on both planes causing massive production delays.

Perhaps we should thank Boeing and Airbus for reminding us that even with tremendous funding for simulation and lab work, it is virtually impossible to control for every factor. Unfortunately, for these aerospace giants, they did not follow the basic tenets of test-centric assembly.

Test-centric assembly is a method developed for failsafe leak testing more than four decades ago. The concept eliminates bad parts before they become even more expensive to scrap or rework.

Now, with robots and factory Ethernet, flexible automation is the new standard in manufacturing, and leak testing has evolved to adapt. What has not changed are the fundamentals of leak testing. They are as constant as gravity.

Dunk testing, the oldest technique in the world, still works, but it’s slow and has limits. Bubbles get trapped. Tanks become contaminated, and that drives up maintenance costs. Part size, complexity and other factors limit what can be tested this way. Pressure rise and decay methods are easy, often requiring merely a gauge, but data is hard to interpret. In addition, mechanical parts often fail, so maintenance is constant and accuracy is dicey. Mass-flow leak testing is faster and more reliable. Helium testing is even more so, but at a much higher cost.

All have pros and cons. Some work well in high-speed production settings; some do not. Audit testing dictates leak-testing choices in ways that do not apply in production testing. Durability testing is another factor that affects choices.

The temptation to lean on software for product testing may be high, but even Boeing and Airbus with all their access to simulation cannot be sure that every real-world factor is programmed accurately into their software. Your best production engineers may know how to simulate, but they may not know when to use certain test techniques to find hidden issues.

Test-centric assembly is important because it contributes to higher yield. It’s a core asset to quality control, and it boosts overall profitability. When properly applied, the concept ensures that assemblies meet standards deemed as failsafe.

Testing experts know techniques to ensure the leak testing process does not overlook concerns like altitude, temperature and humidity. Even the act of pressurizing a part can affect results, and sometimes parts just have to be tested in exactly the orientation they are mounted on the final assembly.

It is tempting to think you have the right people to determine all your testing needs. You may have the greatest production engineers in your industry, but given the experience with Boeing and Airbus, doesn’t it make sense to collaborate with test experts when your brand is on the line? What test-centric partnerships have you created to ensure that new products avoid real-world pitfalls?

Designed by a team of structural engineers at Airbus, the Concept Plane’s relatively lightweight design is based on the human skeleton structure and is expected to lower fuel costs.

The European aircraft manufacturer stated that the aim would be to 3D print the composite material which would result in the structure.

Boeing announced the launch of the 787-10 Dreamliner, the third member of its 787 family, at the 50th International Paris Air Show currently being held at Le Bourget Airport.

The new 787-10 will fly up to 7,000nm, covering more than 90% of the world’s twin-aisle routes, with seating capacity of 300-330 passengers.



The 787-9, the second member of the family, is in final assembly in Everett, Washington, US, and is scheduled to make its maiden flight later this year.

British low-cost carrier easyJet is in advanced talks with European aircraft manufacturer Airbus for the purchase of more than 100 jetliners, in a deal estimated to be worth $10bn.

The deal would include orders for about 100 A320neo aircraft with an option for an additional 120 airliners, which will mark the carrier’s first largest order in more than a decade, according to sources familiar with the matter.

Featuring large Sharklet wing-tip devices, the A320neo will provide a double-digit reduction in NOx emissions and reduce engine noise, according to Airbus.

Russian leasing firm Ilyushin Finance’s (IFC) shareholders have approved the purchase agreement for 42 Bombardier CSeries aircraft, a move that converts the agreement to a firm order.

The firm purchase agreement includes the acquisition of 32 CS300 aircraft, with an option to purchase a further ten.

IFC signed a letter of intent in 2011 and a conditional purchase agreement was announced by Bombardier on 20 February this year.

Thomson Airways has taken delivery of its first Boeing 787 Dreamliner, becoming the first UK airline to operate the wide-body, twin-engine jetliner.

The new 787, which is the first of eight 787s Thomson Airways has on order, completed its delivery flight from Paine Field in Everett, Washington, and arrived at Manchester Airport.

The carrier will fly the new aircraft from London Gatwick, Manchester, East Midlands and Glasgow airports, on long-haul routes to Sanford, Florida and Cancun in Mexico, starting from 8 July.

Boeing has predicted that airlines, lessors and freight firms will need 35,280 passenger aeroplanes, valued at $4.8tn, in the next two decades.

In its latest current market outlook (CMO), the company raised its previous 20-year forecast for commercial jet demand by 3.8%.

Boeing analysts believe the global aircraft fleet will double in the next 20 years and expects passenger and cargo traffic to grow by five percent annually.

Ireland-based low-cost carrier Ryanair has finalised a firm order for 175 next-generation 737-800 aeroplanes, valued at $15.6bn at list prices, at the 50th International Paris Air Show currently being held at Le Bourget Airport.

The firm order is part of the carrier’s efforts to increase its fleet by a third to 400 aeroplanes, which was announced as a commitment in March.

This order marks the largest ever Boeing aircraft order from a European airline.

A type md4-1000 drone, from German company microdrones, has completed a complex record flight by taking off from Switzerland and crossing the Saint-Gotthard Massif to Italy.

The drone crossed the Alps via the Saint-Gotthard Massif between Hospental and Airolo in Switzerland.

Lasting for almost 25 minutes, the flight was monitored by a professional stunt and film team.

The rebranded Airbus group will be split into three divisions, the company announced on Wednesday: commercial planes; defence and space; and military and civilian helicopters. It is the most significant corporate shakeup for the business since the German government blocked a €35bn (£30.6bn) merger between EADS and British defence group BAE Systems last year.

""The renaming simply gathers the entire company under the best brand we have, one that stands for internationalisation, innovation and integration – and also for some two-thirds of our revenues,"" said the chief executive, Tom Enders. ""It reinforces the message that 'we make things fly'.""

The change in branding underscores the importance of the commercial planes business and its rapidly growing order book. In the first six months of 2013, Airbus Commercial netted 722 orders for aircraft, up sharply on 230 for the same period last year.

At the Paris Air Show alone, Airbus took orders for 241 planes, including 65 orders for the A350 from Air France, Singapore Airlines and United Airlines.

Airbus has been battling it out with Boeing for supremacy in the £66bn-a-year passenger jet market, after its US rival took the top spot last year in both orders and deliveries.

Revenues for the military arm of the Airbus business were also up, even though orders for military aircraft fell to eight aircraft from 21. Eurocopter, which makes civilian and military helicopters, reported a 7% fall in revenues as the company delivered fewer helicopters. But overall, the better-than-expected performance helped lift EADS's revenues for the first half of the year by 6% to €26.3bn (£22bn).

The re-organisation is due to be complete by the end of 2014 and Enders said it was the logical next step for the company. ""We affirm the predominance of commercial aeronautics in our group and we restructure and focus our defence and space activities to take costs out, increase profitability and improve our market position.""

The markets cheered the news with EADS shares rising 2.16% on the Paris stock exchange to €45.22.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999821186065674}",positive,0.9999821186065674,1
Airbus' New Composite Airliner Completes First Flight Testing Phase - WIRED,"Mon, 22 Jul 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS8yMDEzLzA3L2FpcmJ1cy1maXJzdC1waGFzZS1hMzUwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus' new A350 XWB composite airliner recently wrapped up its first month of flight testing, completing the first phase of the scheduled year-long program. Since the initial flight on June 14, test pilots have flown 92 hours in the new airliner, defining the performance envelope and testing all the key on-board systems.

With a wingspan of 213 feet, the new A350 is slightly larger than Boeing's composite airliner, the 787. The first test aircraft, known as MSN1, is now undergoing scheduled maintenance and an upgrade of the flight test instrumentation and equipment, before beginning the second phase of testing in August. During the first four-week phase, Airbus evaluated the basic performance of the airplane, confirming the various airspeeds at each end of the scale, as well as the speeds used for the various phases of flight such as cruise and landing. The airplane maker also performed initial tests on the electrical system, the landing gear and brakes, and cabin pressurization, along with the autopilot and autoland systems.

Over the next year, Airbus will use a fleet of five test aircraft to complete the 2,500 hours of testing it expects to need in order to certify and deliver the first A350 XWB to the airlines. The next prototype will be primarily used for extreme conditions, including high altitude and hot and cold weather testing. Two aircraft will be used for testing cabin systems and demonstrating long flight capabilities. A fifth aircraft will be used primarily for noise tests, as well as pilot training for the initial airline customers.

With typical seating arrangements, the A350 will have room for around 350 to 400 passengers, making it more of a competitor to Boeing's 777. The airplane uses composite panels that are mounted onto a composite airframe, compared to the segmented composite barrels used to make the fuselage of the 787. The A350 production aircraft will not use lithium-ion batteries as its main on board power supply, instead opting for the more traditional nickel-cadmium batteries. Airbus has orders for 678 of the twin-aisle jets and plans on delivering the first customer aircraft during the second half of 2014.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999682903289795}",neutral,0.9999682903289795,0

EADS will be called Airbus Group, after its core planemaking subsidiary, and will combine its defense and space activities in one division together with Airbus Military transporters, currently twinned with passenger jets.

Eurocopter, the world's largest commercial helicopter maker, will be renamed Airbus Helicopters.

The announcement came as EADS completed a strategy review and raised the 2013 order target for its core Airbus unit by 25 percent to more than 1,000 aircraft, as reported by Reuters earlier this month.

Other targets were unchanged.

Powered by Airbus commercial profits, which offset lower helicopter and space earnings, second-quarter EADS operating profit rose 23 percent to 887 million euros ($1.18 billion) on revenue of 13.945 billion, up 3 percent.

Analysts were on average expecting second-quarter operating profit of 839 million euros on revenue of 13.693 billion.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7354634404182434}",neutral,0.7354634404182434,0

The Airbus reportedly descended 1,600 feet in a short period of time, lifting passengers off their seats and causing flight attendants to hit their heads on the ceiling.

The pilots had been advised by controllers of the jump plane’s position, and had it in view on TCAS, according to news reports.

Separation was reported as 400 feet vertical and 1.6 miles horizontal at the closest point. The Airbus was at 14,400 feet when it received a TCAS resolution advisory (RA) to descend immediately to 12,800 feet. Spirit said its pilots reacted according to procedures. The FAA is investigating whether or not the evasive maneuver was safe or not, though pilots are required to follow RAs regardless of whether they have spotted the conflicting traffic visually, though they must do so without jeopardizing the safety of the flight.

National news reports included interviews with passengers who described screaming and crying in the cabin as the airliner descended rapidly. One passenger told the Associated Press, “It was horrifying. We thought we were going down.”

"Airbus records its 1,000th delivery as the A330 goes from Cinderella to princess | CAPA - CAPA - Centre for Aviation","Sun, 28 Jul 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL2NlbnRyZWZvcmF2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS9hbmFseXNpcy9yZXBvcnRzL2FpcmJ1cy1yZWNvcmRzLWl0cy0xMDAwdGgtZGVsaXZlcnktYXMtdGhlLWEzMzAtZ29lcy1mcm9tLWNpbmRlcmVsbGEtdG8tcHJpbmNlc3MtMTIwNjg30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Largest A330 customers by order as of Mar-2013

Between 2008 and 2012, the A330 outsold the 787 by a factor of nearly two-to-one, and sales of the aircraft are nearly even over the last decade. The growth in global long-haul travel from the developing world, particularly Asia-Pacific, Middle East and sections of Europe, and the related expansion in the global appetite for widebody aircraft, has ensured that the A330 remains in demand.

Boeing 787 and A330 annual orders (gross): 2004 to 2013

Airbus markets the A330 as 'the right aircraft, right now'. The aircraft is optimised for mid to long-range missions up to 6,000-7,000nm which, Airbus maintains, offers it an advantage over very long-range aircraft such as the 777 and even the 787 and A350 XWB, which are optimised for flight profiles of 8,000-8,500nm, or even further. Airbus has continually introduced incremental improvements in the aircraft, reducing fuel burn, updating interiors and avionics and extending the operating range, as part of a bid to ensure that the aircraft remains in production beyond 2020.

Competition delays on the 787 translated into continuing orders for the A330

When the 787 was formally offered to customers in 2004, its extraordinarily rapid acceptance was seen as a major threat to the A330's continuing sales. With similar passenger capacity, longer range and a promised 20% improvement in economics, the composite aircraft reached an impressive 900 orders in just four years. However, the A330's status as proven platform and its combination of availability and reliability have seen it hold sway in the face of the next generation of aircraft.

With more than three years of delays in getting the 787 to customers and Airbus being forced back to the drawing board with its initial A350 concept, the A330 has been the prime option for airlines seeking widebody aircraft of around 250 seats.

Boeing's highly visible 787 teething issues - including engine problems, a 100-day grounding due to lithium-ion battery fires and the recent onboard fire traced to an emergency locator transmitter - have served to enhance the attractiveness of the A330 as a known quantity.

Airlines, frustrated at being unable to get their hands on Boeing's latest jet, turned to the older aircraft to tide them over until the next generation of widebody aircraft enters service. In 2007, the same year as the first 787 delay announcement, A330 sales reached more than 150 aircraft, while orders of Boeing's venerable 767 hit a six-year high.

As a result, some of the largest A330 customers have also been among the largest customers for the 787.

Largest A330 and 787 joint customers

With resurgent demand, Airbus slowly but surely increased A330 output. Over the past nine years production rates have doubled, reaching a record high of 10 aircraft per month in Apr-2013. Given Airbus' work schedule, this level of output translates to around 110 aircraft per year. In the first half of 2013, Airbus delivered 54 A330s, a figure it should better in the second half of the year by two to three aircraft.

According to chief operating officer John Leahy, Airbus plans to maintain production at this rate until at least 2015, even though the aircraft's order backlog only stands at 280 aircraft. Mr Leahy is confident the A330 will stay in production past 2020.

Orders have slowed in 2013 but there is more A330 development ahead

2013 has however been a slow year for A330 orders, with just eight firm orders. Airbus has half a dozen sales campaigns for the aircraft underway and is also patiently waiting on some A330 orders from China to be unfrozen. An order for 45 A330s for Chinese state-owned airlines was held hostage over China's opposition to Europe's unilateral decision to expand its emissions trading scheme beyond Europe. With the temporary resolution of the dispute in late 2012, 18 of the orders have now gone through, but the remaining 27 orders remain in limbo, pending international progress on an airlines emission scheme.

To keep the orders flowing as increasing numbers of the similarly sized 787s enter service, Airbus is looking at ways it can enhance the aircraft further to increase its attractiveness to customers. The manufacturer is investing more than EUR150 million per annum in a continuous development programme to ensure that it stays up to date and continues to improve its performance.

Over the past decade Airbus has invested one euro in improvements for every euro originally spent developing the aircraft. In 2010, it launched a dedicated freighter version, the A330-200F, but sales have been slow, largely due to the global economic slowdown which has had a proportionally greater impact on freight traffic. Airbus has sold only 45 of the new version.

Midway through 2012, Airbus announced it was raising A330 take-off weights to 240 tonnes and offering a 1% improvement in fuel burn via an aerodynamic improvement package (derived from A350 technology). A further 1% improvement in fuel burn from engine enhancements is expected to come from engine manufacturers. The improvements offer up to 400nm in additional range.

Towards the end of the year, Airbus then announced yet more enhancements will come for the aircraft by mid-2015. This includes raising the take-off weight to 242 tonnes, increasing maximum range by 350nm for the A330-200 and 500nm for the A330-300, opening up some key markets such as Europe to the US west coast. With these upgrades, Airbus will have added almost 50% range to the A330-300 since it entered service.

To keep the aircraft attractive as increasing numbers of 787s enter operations, Airbus is now considering a 'regional' version of the aircraft, aimed at high density markets with short flight profiles, such as in Southeast Asia and on domestic routes in China. At this year's Paris Air Show, Mr Leahy confirmed that the company will offer a 'regional' version of the A350-900, structurally unmodified but featuring lower thrust engines to make it better suited for shorter routes, in order to match the payload-range capability of Boeing's double-stretch 787-10, which was also announced at the Paris Air Show.

A regional A330 would follow a similar concept, with a reduced take-off weight, lower thrust engines and possibly higher density passenger cabin configurations, in order to reduce acquisition and engine/airframe MRO costs. The average mission distance of the A330-300 is just 1,800nm. According to Mr Leahy, the regional A330 may be offered to customers by the end of 2013.

Nearly half of the operating A330s are in the Asia Pacific region - and half the orders are there too

Of the 1,000 A330s already delivered, 988 are still in service, testament to the commercial suitability and longevity of the design, as well as to the rapidly increasing output in recent years. Just under 50% of A330s delivered have been produced in the last five and a half years.

A330 deliveries by year

Nearly 45% of all A330s produced are in service in the Asia-Pacific region, notably in China, Southeast Asia and Australia; five of the 10 largest A330 operators are based in Asia Pacific.

In addition to the large numbers of A330s already serving the region, around half of the A330 order backlog is with customers in Asia Pacific.

A330 deployment by region: as of 30-Jun-2013

Asia's fast developing carriers have favoured the A330 for its ability to serve both high density intra-regional routes and long-haul intercontinental flights. With the progressive range improvements introduced by Airbus, the high capacity A330-300 will now serve most European capitals from Southeast Asia. The longer ranged but lower capacity A330-200 is able to operate to all of Europe, as well as trans-Pacific routes from almost any point in Asia-Pacific.

Cathay Pacific has been a prolific customer and user of the type, with 37 in service in its mainline fleet and another 18 in operation with its wholly-owned subsidiary Dragonair. The A330 is particularly popular on the island, with Hong Kong Airlines also owning a fleet of 17 and leasing three out to its parent Hainan Airlines.

Mainland China is also fertile ground for the A330. Air China is the single largest operator of the type, with 37 at its mainline operation and four operating with its regional branches. The carrier also has another 12 A330s on order, which it will use to phase out a combination of older generation A340s and its 757-200s. China Eastern Airlines is also a major user, with 31 in service and another six on order. In North Asia, Korean Airlines too is a leading user, with 23 in service and another eight on order.

The A330 has been popular with full service airlines and LCCs alike

In Australia, the Qantas Group has 30 A330s in operation, 20 with its mainline Qantas brand, serving a mix of domestic and long-haul routes, as well as 10 with its Jetstar brand, which has helped pioneer the low-cost, long-haul model in the region. Another LCC pioneer, AirAsia X, has also favoured the aircraft, with a dozen in service and another 14 on order.

Southeast Asian state-owned airlines have also favoured the aircraft. Singapore Airlines and Malaysian Airlines both have 22 in service, while Thai Airways International operates 27.

The aircraft has also been popular in Europe, particularly with large legacy airlines such as Lufthansa, KLM and Air France, as well as with Turkish Airlines and Aeroflot. European carriers have another 35 A330s yet to be delivered, with Turkish Airlines alone having orders for another 17.

The 'Big Three' sixth freedom carriers of the Middle East - Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways - have also taken a liking to the A330. Between them they operate 83 A330s, more than 70% of the regional A330 fleet. However, their days with the aircraft are numbered, as they have shown a clear preference for new aircraft such as the A350 and 787. The three airlines have ordered 177 of the new twin jets, but have just three A330s left in their order backlogs.

Outside Europe, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East's long-haul carriers Airbus has had much less success. In North America, Delta Air Lines is the largest user, but only after inheriting 32 A330s in its merger with Northwest Airlines.

As in the Middle East, North American use of the aircraft has been concentrated in the hands of a few major operators: between them Delta, US Airways (18 aircraft), Hawaiian Airlines (13 aircraft and another nine on order) and Air Canada (eight aircraft) account for 80% of all those flying in the region.

Leasing companies are strong supporters too, sensing good value retention

However, another type of North American customer has been very good for the A330: leasing companies. ILFC is Airbus' single largest customer for the type, having ordered 98 aircraft and placed all of them with customers. CIT Leasing has ordered 51 and GECAS has ordered 33. Leasing companies have favoured the aircraft not only for its utility and demand, but also for its low risk and large installed user base.

The A330's lease rates and second hand rates have also held up well compared to older widebodies such as the A340 and Boeing 747-400. Ireland's AerCap has ordered 26 A330s, while Intrepid Aviation's entire fleet and order book of 20 aircraft consists of nothing but A330s.

Like the Middle East carriers though, leasing companies are now focusing on the next generation of widebodies. Lessor orders for the A330 have almost dried up, with the last order by a major leasing company being placed in Jul-2012. CIT Leasing is still to take delivery of 25 A330s, while Intrepid Aviation has another 18 on order.

Airbus remains optimistic on ordering and production output

Airbus is optimistic that repeat customers and new orders will allow it to keep the A330 in production well into the next decade. The flood of orders in the middle of last decade is unlikely to be repeated, but with sales campaigns ongoing and global demand for widebody aircraft unabated, A330 sales will continue to trickle in.

While some major carriers and lessors have shifted their attention to more modern aircraft, existing A330 operators, smaller airlines and leasing companies will still have a place for the aircraft, thanks to its combination of pricing, availability, reliability and efficiency.

Africa and Latin America are virtually untouched markets and there is still room for demand in Asia. The A330 won't be setting long term sales records, but Airbus should be comfortably able to sustain output at 10 aircraft per month for years to come.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9991124272346497}",positive,0.9991124272346497,1

Airbus Takes Aircraft Accessibility To The Next Level - Reduced Mobility Rights,"Mon, 01 Jul 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZHVjZWRtb2JpbGl0eS5ldS8yMDEzMDcwMTMyOC9UaGUtTmV3cy9haXJidXMtdGFrZXMtYWlyY3JhZnQtYWNjZXNzaWJpbGl0eS10by10aGUtbmV4dC1sZXZlbC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Our recent visit at the Paris Air Show focused on spotting innovative solutions enhancing aircraft accessibility thus improving in-flight comfort for passengers with reduced mobility.

Producing almost half of the world’s commercial airliners, Airbus recently introduced a revolutionary concept that will significantly improve quality of air travel for passengers who need an on board wheelchair to move about the cabin and make use of the on board toilet.

Modern long haul aircraft are usually equipped with accessible toilets; however, single aisle short haul aircraft do not have such feature, making the use of toilets very difficult.

""I am unable to get to, let alone get in the toilets and so I limit liquid intake. I sometimes use my toilet bottle or leg bag, but neither is ideal,"" Martyn Sibley, who suffers from Spinal Muscular Atrophy, recently told us.

Starting this fall Airbus will begin deliveries of aircraft of the A320 family equipped with the revolutionary Space-Flex lavatory, an innovative solution that will radically improve the in-flight experience for passengers like Martyn.

To fit the Space-Flex toilet the rear of the aircraft has been reconfigured, with existing lavatories moved to the rear end of the aircraft.

The two toilets, each of a size comparable with those existing in the A320 family of aircraft, become one through a simple process of conversion: two Space-Flex toilets can be converted into one space for persons of reduced mobility, in a similar way to those used in wide-body Airbus aircraft.

This solution foresees different options to fit the needs of all Airbus customers, even low cost airlines. By selecting additional galleys with different capacity on the right hand side before the aft door, an airline would gain three additional seats. However, without any galley before door four, the gain could be as high as six additional seats.

Delivering full accessibility whilst giving the option of adding up to six more paying seats could represent the perfect recipe to entice airlines to purchase new aircraft featuring the Space-Flex lavatory option.

Brazilian airline LATAM is the pilot customer for this truly innovative concept. The airline ordered 39 A320 aircraft fitted with Space-Flex lavatories. “Space-Flex maximises the cabin revenue space and therefore gives us more flexibility in our new Airbus A320 Family aircraft,” said José Maluf of LATAM Airlines. “In the future we could easily adapt to market demand and improve seat-mile costs by adding six seats without any compromise in comfort.”

EasyJet founder to vote against airline's plan to buy 135 new Airbus planes - The Guardian,"Mon, 01 Jul 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEzL2p1bC8wMS9lYXN5amV0LWZvdW5kZXItdm90ZS1hZ2FpbnN0LWJ1eS1haXJidXPSAVhodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAxMy9qdWwvMDEvZWFzeWpldC1mb3VuZGVyLXZvdGUtYWdhaW5zdC1idXktYWlyYnVz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"EasyJet's founder and largest shareholder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, has said he will vote against the budget airline's plan to buy 135 new aircraft, at an investor meeting later this month.

The company revealed last month that it had agreed to buy 35 current generation A320 aircraft and 100 new generation A320neo aircraft from Airbus, for delivery between 2015 – 2022. It has options to buy a further 100 A320neo planes.

If the deal goes ahead, easyJet will use the new aircraft to replace ageing planes as they leave the fleet, and to facilitate growth.

Haji-Ioannou, who founded the airline in 1995 and owns a 37% stake with his family, said in an open letter to shareholders that he would reject the deal worth around $11.9bn (£8bn) at list prices at the meeting on 11 July.

In his latest clash with the easyJet board, he criticised its failure to disclose the level of discount secured from Airbus, describing it as a secret deal, and asking: ""Would you eat in a restaurant where the menu has no prices?""

""As the person with the most to gain if this company increases profitability and the most to lose if the outcome from this order is not as promised by the board, it is my firm opinion that this is a good deal for Airbus and a bad deal for easyJet shareholders,"" he wrote.

He added: ""I strongly believe public company directors should be legally held to account for their decisions. I will hold these directors to account, if at some point in the future it turns out that their decision to overcommit the company today was wrong.""

Haji-Ioannou said his objections were partly based on a belief that the new order will lead to a hunt for new, unprofitable routes. He also claimed that costs per seat had increased by 25% over the past four years, arguing that if the trend continued, customers were unlikely to pay the ""ever increasing ticket prices"".

Despite his objections, Haji-Ioannou said he expected the majority of shareholders to approve the plan.

A spokesman for easyJet declined to comment.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9972334504127502}",neutral,0.9972334504127502,0

The 1000th Aircraft is for Cathay Pacific, and adorned as such.

Images – Airbus SAS –

This A330-300 will make up part of cadre of 56 A330’s that Cathay Pacific and Dragonair own – making them the biggest operator of the type.

The plane has also developed since the first delivery, with a possible range of 7,250 nautical miles or 13,420 km. Inside, the plane is fitted out with Cathay’s latest cabin.

There are two variants of the A330 – the A330-300 (Payload optimised) and the A330-200 (range optimised). Even the most maddening operator will find it difficult to mess up an A330 on the inside – even in Economy which normally is delivered in a lovely 2-4-2 format (unless they go 3-3-3 in it – Air Transat, Air Asia X come to mind).

For Cathay Pacific, the A330 is the backbone of its mid-haul fleet, with reliability, flexibility and good economics to run this aircraft on mid-haul segments.

Cathay Pacific operate they operate 38 A330-300’s and 11 A340 wide body aircraft, whilst DragonWings operate 18 A330-300’s and 21 Airbus A320 Family aircraft. The group has 10 more A330’s to be delivered in the current order, with 48 Airbus A350XWB’s of varying configurations to come.

From a personal/passenger viewpoint, I love A330’s. They offer a great ride (be in the back or near the front of the plane), the 2-4-2 seating in economy is just comfortable, and both versions have the legs to go for miles. It’s good to see that some airlines have seen the benefit of operating them.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9835335612297058}",positive,0.9835335612297058,1
First British Airways A380 superjumbo arrives at Heathrow - The Guardian,"Thu, 04 Jul 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEzL2p1bC8wNC9icml0aXNoLWFpcndheXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtaGVhdGhyb3fSAVVodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAxMy9qdWwvMDQvYnJpdGlzaC1haXJ3YXlzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLWhlYXRocm93?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The first of a new generation of British Airways doubledecker superjumbos has arrived at Heathrow, bringing the promise of the quieter, fuel-efficient flying sought by passengers, airlines, and the airport's neighbours alike.

The 469-seat Airbus A380, the first to be owned by a UK airline, was signed over in a ceremony at the manufacturer's Toulouse airport base before departing for London.

Airbus claims that the giant planes, with an upper deck six feet wider than the Boeing 747s they will replace, will each save the airline £100m in fuel costs over their lifetimes. The fuel bill for one long-haul flight runs into six figures and the A380 is said to be 16% more efficient.

More significantly for those under the flightpath, the A380's ""noise footprint"" on landing at Heathrow – the area greatly affected by noise disturbance – is claimed to be a quarter of that of a 747.

Heathrow charges lower landing fees to quieter aircraft and is continuing to develop stands and taxiways to accommodate the A380s.

Matt Gorman, Heathrow's sustainability director, said the aircraft would contribute to noise reduction and that noise now affected fewer people around the airport than at any time since the 1970s, despite flight numbers having almost doubled.

Keith Williams, the chief executive of BA, told crew and passengers: ""You're part of the future.""

Both BA and Heathrow believe the aircraft will transform aviation – including the fraught debate over additional runways at London's hub airport. BA has ordered 12 A380s. Four other airlines already operate the planes out of Heathrow.

Williams said: ""These aircraft are the start of a new era for British Airways. Over the next 15 months, we will take delivery of new aircraft at the rate of one a fortnight as we put ourselves at the forefront of modern aviation.

""The A380 is a fantastic aircraft and an excellent showpiece for British engineering. Our customers are going to love the space, light and comfort on board.""

BA is unlikely to have secured the same discount on the $403m (£265m) list price obtained by the earliest adopters, but takes delivery after Airbus has resolved the problems of cracks in the wings that grounded several A380s in 2012.

Fabrice Brégier, the chief executive of Airbus, said it was a ""very proud moment"" and significant for the image of Airbus, marking the first longhaul aircraft the European manufacturer has supplied to a previously entirely Boeing-made BA longhaul fleet.

He said that BA, which has ordered 12 A380s as well as 18 A350s, the plane that made its first test flight last month, was among its top 10 customers but added, with a Gallic dash, that it was much higher ""in our hearts"" – a notable change from the once frosty relationship between Airbus and BA.

Brégier said that the constraints of Heathrow, where the limit on takeoffs and landings has been reached, meant that more airlines would be looking to the capacity offered by the superjumbo.

Airbus's chief operating officer, John Leahy, speaking aboard the flight from Toulouse, said that 40% of the A380 was British-made and that Airbus was sustaining 100,000 jobs in the wider supply chain. Around 4,500 people in Britain worked directly on the A380. BA has also chosen Trent-900 engines made by Rolls-Royce in Derby.

The flight touched down at Heathrow just after 10.30am, with the pilot, Captain James Basnett, telling passengers that the flight was making aviation history, adding: ""Ladies and gentlemen, you have never seen a bigger smile on the face of a captain in your life.""

The plane was met by 380 British Airways employees at a hangar in Heathrow.

BA's first Boeing 787 Dreamliners – carbon-fibre planes which are much smaller than the A380 but with a similar range and fuel efficiency – arrived at Heathrow last week, making BA the first airline in Europe to operate both of the pioneering planes.

The A380's first passenger flight will be to Los Angeles on 24 September.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9618268013000488}",neutral,0.9618268013000488,0

Several senior RAF officers were given a tour of a Portuguese air force Airbus Military C295 multimission aircraft at the 20-21 July Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT) at Fairford in Gloucestershire. Operated by the service's 502 Sqn from Montijo air base, the adapted transport was on static display in its MPA configuration, which includes onboard operator workstations, an electro-optical infrared camera and a maritime search radar.

Portugal operates 12 C295s, with five equipped with the pallet-based MPA fit at any one time. This configuration includes fuselage-mounted side-looking airborne radar sensors, used for tasks including pollution detection.

""We have a 200-mile [range] radar which can track up to 1,000 targets,"" says 502 Sqn commanding officer Lt Col Pedro Bernardino. Other roles undertaken by the unit in four years of operating the C295 have included troop transport, supporting long-range search and rescue operations involving the Portuguese air force's AgustaWestland AW101 helicopters, and acting as a command and control platform during aerial firefighting activities, he says.

Airbus Military has already discussed potential co-operation with local equipment suppliers for a potential UK competition, says Gary Soul, head of strategy and business development at EADS UK. The company, which he says ""has a slick solution, with some winning ideas"", displayed a model of a torpedo-equipped C295 in RAF markings in its chalet at RIAT. The manufacturer has already cleared a similar combination for the Chilean navy, and recently performed airborne separation tests using MBDA's Marte Mk2 anti-ship missile.

Other possible candidates for a potential UK multimission/MPA requirement would include the Boeing 737-based P-8 and a so-called Swordfish offering based on the Saab 2000. The Swedish company brought an unmodified example of its out-of-production regional airliner to RIAT, using it to fly in senior executives including chief executive Håkan Buskhe.

Following its retirement of the Nimrod MR2 and cancellation of the planned replacement Nimrod MRA4 in late 2010, the MoD is sustaining a so-called ""seedcorn"" initiative aimed at maintaining personnel experience on dedicated MPA assets flown by allies Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA.

The MoD planned to spend £3.8 million ($5.8 million) during the 2012-13 financial year on the seedcorn activity, with this involving 34 RAF personnel, according to information released in April.

Croatia Airlines is planning on purchasing Embraer aircraft to replace part of its costly Airbus fleet. In line with its restructuring program, the Croatian carrier anticipates the sale of three of its Airbus jets in the coming period. Originally, the airline intended to sell two of its Airbus aircraft and lease them back immediately, a common cost saving measure. However, the management is believed to have given up on the idea. The airline is now keen on purchasing Embraer jets from the Lufthansa owned Augsburg Airways, which is to cease operations on October 31. Croatia Airlines recently leased out one of its A320s to Tunisian based Syphax Airlines and began procedures on cancelling its order for four Airbus A319s.Aviation analysts warn Croatia Airlines’ planned shift to Embraer will be extremely costly as the airline has never operated the type and would have three different aircraft types in its fleet - Airbus, Embraer and Bombardier. Apart from selling some of its Airbus jets, the Croatian carrier also plans to sell engines from its aircraft, as outlined in a recent restructuring program approved by the Croatian Competition Agency. Furthermore, it will sell land owned at Zagreb Airport and its shares in “Obzor putovanja”, “Amadeus” and “Pleso prevoz”.As part of its restructuring program Croatia Airlines will also sell its lucrative slots at Heathrow Airport. Earlier this year the airline discontinued its Zagreb - Gatwick service but maintains flights to the airport from Split. It is estimated the Croatian carrier will earn 25 to 30 million pounds for its slots at Europe’s busiest airport. In February the airline reported its London route was struggling to make a profit, warning that flights to Heathrow would be under review for the 2014 summer season. Further slots are to be sold at several other European airports.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996566772460938}",neutral,0.9996566772460938,0
Rolls-Royce: Algae-powered planes within next 20 years - Climate Home News,"Tue, 02 Jul 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsaW1hdGVjaGFuZ2VuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDEzLzA3LzAyL3JvbGxzLXJveWNlLWh5YnJpZC1wbGFuZXMtd2l0aGluLW5leHQtMjAteWVhcnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Nilima Choudhury

Airbus constructors EADS and leading engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce believe algae could replace kerosene as an aviation fuel within the next two decades.



Powered by a hybrid propulsion system similar in concept to the technology found in many energy efficient cars, it would produce 75% less carbon dioxide than today’s planes.

The hybrid engine would use a combination of electricity and biofuel from algae.

“We have already proved that it is technically possible to fly with algae oil. Now we need to demonstrate that the industrial production of algae-based biofuel is both ecologically and economically viable,” said Jean Botti, chief technical officer of EADS, reports International Business Times.

In 2010, EADS showcased the world’s first flight of an aircraft powered by biofuel from algae. Under this new design, the plane would be propelled by six electric fans on the back of its wings.

During take-off and flight, the plane’s fans will draw power from a lithium battery, which the engine will recharge once the aircraft has reached cruising altitude.

Botti believes that this type of plane could be fully operational within 20 years.

The air transport sector generates around 2% of global man-made CO2 emissions. As the aviation industry has no alternative to liquid fuels of fossil origin, the use of biofuels is essential for it to drastically reduce CO2 emissions.

At the beginning of June, the 240 members of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) trade group, representing 84% of global air traffic, called for a mandatory system that would require airlines to offset any growth in their emissions after 2020.

Efforts to regulate greenhouse gases from the aviation sector have stalled although there are hopes for a deal this Autumn.

Microalgae

Algae are considered to be promising potential feedstock for biofuels, as certain species of algae contain high amounts of oil. This oil can be extracted, processed and refined for various uses.

Microalgae reproduce rapidly and create at least 30 times more organic substance (biomass) per cultivation area than, for example, rapeseed.

Their cultivation does not compete with food production because algae can be grown on poor quality land using non potable or saltwater.

The exhaust gas quality measurements indicate that biofuel from algae contains eight times less hydrocarbons than kerosene derived from crude oil.

Research and development

At the Paris Air Show last month, Airbus announced it was working with the European Commission and other stakeholders to develop a European roadmap, Flightpath, for the implementation of aviation biofuels in Europe.

As a first step the project targets the annual production of two million tonnes of aviation biofuel by 2020 (representing roughly 4% of EU aviation fuel consumption).

Airbus believes that by 2030, up to a third of aviation fuel could come from alternative sources.

The aircraft manufacturer Airbus alongside other companies like Air France established a group at the Paris Air Show to illustrate the French industry’s technical capacity to integrate aeronautical biofuels.

Since 2007, Air France claims to have been has been reducing its fuel consumption per passenger by around 7%.

The company supports an innovative project to demonstrate production of biofuels from forestry waste undertaken by the French atomic energy and renewable energies commission. Air France will also be part of the company in charge of the production’s industrialisation.

The first deliveries are expected in 2018, representing 15,000 tonnes per year.

Also present at the Air Show was Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner.

“Boeing has made steady progress throughout the jet age in improving the environmental performance of its products, from fuel use and emissions to community noise,” said Scott Lefaber, spokesperson for Boeing.

“Boeing’s commitment to improving environmental performance is based on the company’s deeply held belief that doing the right thing for the environment also is good business.”

Commercial production

On a global scale, biofuel production remains very low while the cost of production is at least twice that of producing fossil fuel. In France, currently no biofuel is available.

In the US, United Airlines and AltAir Fuels announced the purchase agreement for 15 million gallons of sustainable aviation biofuel in June.

AltAir Fuels will retrofit part of an existing petroleum plant to become a 30 million gallon, advanced biofuel refinery near Los Angeles, Calif. AltAir will produce low-carbon, renewable jet fuel and other renewable products.

More than 56 million jobs and US$2.2 trillion of GDP are supported by the world air travel industry.

The volcanic ash cloud impact in 2010 demonstrated how vital aviation is to global economy; the total drop in GDP through lost revenues from tourism, business and international trade came to $5 billion in the first week alone.

British Airways today took delivery of its new double-decker ‘superjumbo’ which airline bosses say will herald a new era for the nation’s flagship airline.



BA says passengers will find its new £270million Airbus A380 bigger, more spacious, more comfortable, quieter and ‘greener’ than the ageing Jumbo jets it replaces – with fresher in-flight air to boot.

This morning the giant of the skies touched down at Heathrow in London, waved on by cheering BA staff who welcomed its arrival.



The plane is the first of a dozen of A380s ordered by British Airways ahead of the model going into service in the autumn.

British Airways today has taken delivery of the new double-decker 'superjumbo' which airline bosses say will herald 'a new era' for the nation¿s flagship airline - the A3B0

BA says passengers will find its new £270million Airbus A380 bigger, more spacious, more comfortable, quieter and 'greener' than the ageing Jumbo jets it replaces - with fresher in-flight air to boot

It is part of the airline’s wider five-year £5bn investment plan to refresh its fleet with 52 new aircraft including the Airbus’s new rival Boeing 787 dubbed the ‘plastic plane’.

British Airways chief executive Keith Williams was at Airbus’s factory in Toulouse today to sign for hand-over and delivery of his first new A380 plane before flying in it with a small group of journalists - including myself - to BA’s main engineering base at London’s Heathrow Airport.



VIEW FROM THE AIR: RAY MASSEY

'You've never seen a bigger smile on the face of a captain', said the relieved skipper of British Airways' new superjumbo over the speakers as he set down the wheels of the 575 tonne leviathan on Heathrow's hallowed tarmac with a touch as light as a feather.

Captain James Basnett landed BA's new double-decker Airbus A380 - flight BA 9158P for positioning flight- touching down bang on time at 10.30am after a smooth and eerily quiet one and a half hour flight from the Airbuse factory in Toulouse.

No pressure. But aboard the £270million plane with the call sign Speedbird 380 he did have his boss and fifty VIP passengers plus a few journalists like me, scrutinising his every move.

There were cheers on board as the wheels hit the ground without a bump. And even louder cheers from outside when 380 BA staff welcomed the plane to its new UK hangar.

The new double-decker superjumbo – whose high-tech British-built wings support up to 100,000 UK jobs - will be shown off alongside a Boeing 787 Dreamliner at the Hatton Cross site.



British Airways is also the first airline in Europe to operate both the Airbus A380 and the rival Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the first two of which landed at Heathrow last week.



The vast superjumbo planes can theoretically carry up to 800 people – provided all the passengers are squeezed into narrow economy-sized seats.



But British Airways’ new A380s is making do with just 469 passengers across four classes of cabin classes – with lucrative First and Business class passengers paying a hefty premium for the privilege.

The airline has announced that the first long-haul return flight from London Heathrow to Los Angeles on September 24 is priced from £621 in economy to £2,550 in business and £3,799 in First, while the first Hong Kong return on October 22 is priced from £688 in economy to £2,499 in business and £5,800 in First.

Legroom is 31 inches in economy, 38 inches in premium economy, there’s a 6ft-long bed in business class (Club World) and a luxurious 6ft 6 inch-long bed in First Class.



But BA add that the new economy seats have been cleverly designed to be thinner-backed and hollowed out to increase seating space for passengers.

In addition, Airbus points out that the A380 has 50 per cent more floor-space than a Boeing 747 Jumbo jet – but the number of passengers is just 30 per cent more – meaning each one has more space.

First class passengers have 14 seats at the front of the main deck and enjoy nearly a third more ‘personal space’ and 60 per cent more personal stowage.

Part of British Airways’ five-year £5bn investment plan to refresh the BA fleet with 52 new planes over five years.

Business Class (called Club World by BA ) has 44 seats on the main deck, and 53 seats on the upper deck. Premium economy has 55 seats on the upper deck, while the reminder travelling economy can choose seats on both the main and upper deck.



The airline has ordered 12 A380s for delivery by 2016 of which three will arrive this year followed by a further five in 2014. But it had to raise the roof of its hangars at Heathrow by around 12 feet to accommodate the new superjumbos.

BA said the new aircraft’s innovative design means it is twice as quiet as a Boeing 747 Jumbo jet on take-off – and four times quieter on landing which may help placate some residents around Heathrow.

It is also 16 per cent more fuel efficient per seat than a Jumbo Jet, and claims to be the ‘greenest’ passenger jet in the sky.

British Airways chief executive Mr Williams said: ’These aircraft are the start of a new era for British Airways. Over the next 15 months, we will take delivery of new aircraft at the rate of one a fortnight as we put ourselves at the forefront of modern aviation.’

‘The A380 is a fantastic aircraft and an excellent showpiece for British engineering. Our customers are going to love the space, light and comfort on board.’

Mr Williams said: ’ We are investing £5billion in improving our products and services across the board, whether that is in new aircraft, lounge upgrades, enhanced catering or changes to our short haul product. Renewing our aircraft fleet is a significant part of this.’



He added that some of these aircraft will replace older members of our fleet, and will also allow it to grow its worldwide network and offer customers new and exciting destinations.

Airbus president and chief executive Fabrice Bregier said it was 'a very proud moment' to see the A380 in the livery of British Airways.

He added: 'It is a special day for UK industry too. A significant proportion of this amazing aircraft was designed and built at Airbus UK sites in Filton and Broughton, as well as at our many partners’ facilities across the country.’

All BA’s A380s will be powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines built at Derby which means up to 40 per cent of the value near £300million cost of each superjumbo – or around £120million - is ‘British made’.

Airbus said that over its lifetime of the A380 plane will contribute £15billion to the UK economy with the Rolls-Royce engines adding another £11billion.

But while it may be BA’s first superjumbo, it is the 106th to be delivered with rivals such as Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Qantas Air France and Lufthansa getting in first.

Airbus points out that the A380 has 50 per cent more floor-space than a Boeing 747 Jumbo jet - but the number of passengers is just 30 per cent more - meaning each one has more space

Legroom is 31 inches in economy, 38 inches in premium economy, there¿s a 6ft long bed in business class (Club World) and a luxurious 6ft 6 inch long bed in First Class BA is now is embarking on a complex training programme with pilots and cabin-crew at Manston Airport in Kent. Customer service trials are taking place at Heathrow, and short-haul flying for both aircraft within the UK. However the A380 has not been without its teething problems. Last month air investigators said a mid-flight engine explosion on a Qantas A380 in 2010, which prompted the airline to ground its fleet, was triggered by a poorly built oil-pipe. Rolls-Royce later agreed to pay £58million in compensation.

And last year there were concerns about cracks found in parts of the hi-tech British-built wings. Mile high club: The surprisingly spacious toilets in the new A380 plane which is more than double the size of a traditional airline restroom. BA have said they chose to put two large toilets on the plane instead of showers like on the Emirates Airbus Smart: The spacious new First Class seats on board the A380 Airbus.

The superjumbo has a range of 9,500 miles, is covered in three layers of paint weighing about 500kg and contains so much wiring that if it was laid out end to end, it would stretch from Edinburgh to London.

Business and Energy Minister Michael Fallon said: ""I am proud that around 40% of this iconic aircraft is made in the UK by a range of aerospace manufacturers of all sizes - from our large global companies through to small enterprises.

""With its Rolls-Royce Trent engines and state-of-the-art wings, the A380 slashes travel emissions while boosting efficiency.""

The huge aircraft are already in wide use across the globe, with more than 100 deliveries having been made to world airlines including Air France, Emirates and Qantas.

The Airbus A380's first commercial long-haul flight for BA to Los Angeles in September will come almost five years after Singapore Airlines became the first carrier to operate the plane.

Tripoli, 21 July 2013:

Last Wednesday (17th July) state owned Libyan Airlines received the latest delivery of its new Airbus A330-200.

Yesterday, Libya Herald was invited on board the new craft for a short celebratory flight over Tripoli along with a small group of VIP guests which included, the Minister of Transport Abdulgader Ahmed, Khaled Ben Alewa, CEO of Libyan Airlines and Nasereddin Shaebelain, head of Libya’s Civil Aviation Authority.

The modern Airbus A330-200 craft takes 24 business and 235 economy passengers and is expected to be used on medium to long haul flights, regulators permitting. Libyan Airlines already operates seven A320s and now two A330’s have arrived recently, with a final one expected in 2014. There is also a further four A350’s expected by the end of 2014.

During the short, low altitude flight over Tripoli from Maetiga Airport, Libyan Airlines CEO Khaled Ben Alewa understandably enthused over his latest delivery.

The low altitude flight by the Airbus A330-200 over Tripoli offered great photo opportunities. Tripoli port, Corinthia hotel, Burj Tripoli, Marriot and Dat Il Imad could be seen clearly (Photo:Sami Zaptia).

“Thirteen hours can go to South Africa, North America or China”, he explained referring to the A320-200’s long haul capabilities. “It has a wide body and business class can take 24 passengers”, he added, referring to its wide bodied 2-4-2 economy seating configuration which gives it an increased passenger capacity.

“It is equipped with the latest technology and entertainment”, he said as he gestured to the entertainment screens in front of us. “You can make phone calls and use the internet from your seat”, he added.

Asked what the significance of this craft to the airline would be, the Libyan Airline CEO said that the company “hopes to return to destinations such as Dubai. We hope to start with 5 flights per week then maybe daily between Tripoli and Benghazi. We also hope to start some new destinations which are currently under study”, said Ben Alewa, hinting at leaked news in Tunisian media of plans to fly to Canada in conjunction with Tunisair.

“These two Airbuses (another was received the previous month) will make up for the two airbuses we lost during the revolution”, he said, referring to the two Airbuses that were destroyed during the 2011 Revolution.

“Their loss has made us lose destinations such as Cairo, Casablanca and Istanbul. The other A330 has been used to fly pilgrims to Saudi Arabia. I expect this Airbus will start work next week”, concluded the CEO of Libyan Airlines.

At first glance it may look barely different from your average aeroplane.

But look a bit closer and you’ll see this is the new £270million British Airways Airbus A380 – the double-decker superjumbo that promises to revolutionise air travel.

Guided by a Red Arrow plane over the white cliffs of Dover yesterday, it delighted onlookers ahead of the Royal International Air Tattoo show taking place this weekend.

To be launched at London Heathrow Airport in September, it is designed to be more spacious, comfortable, quieter and greener than other planes of its kind.

Passengers are also promised a ‘clean, purer and draught-free’ quality of cabin air thanks to a new filtering system which changes the air every three minutes and uses special filters to allow 15 different temperature control zones.

It does this by creating a ‘curtain of air’ which descends softly from the top to the bottom of the cabin from where it is re-filtered and re-circulated.

British Airways is the first airline in Europe to operate both the Airbus A380 and the rival Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

British Airways (BA) welcomed its first Airbus A380, the world's biggest commercial aircraft, yesterday as part of a €11.6 billion upgrade to top-of-the-range aircraft that it hopes will give it a boost in the lucrative market for long-haul business travel.

The emergence of the fuel-efficient, double-decker through the grey clouds over Heathrow airport in west London yesterday was greeted by hundreds of BA staff and spectators.

The first long-haul flight on the A380 will fly to Los Angeles on September 24th, the British flag carrier said, earlier than the originally planned October start.

However, don’t go looking for either of BA’s new jets to appear on the timetable. For the first few weeks the aircraft will be swapped into the schedule as to ‘surprise and delight’ passengers.

“Travellers going to Frankfurt for example will turn up at the airport expecting to get on an A320 and they’ll see an A380 instead” Frank van der Post, BA’s Managing Director of Brands and Customer Experience, told Australian Business Traveller.

“But we don’t want to sell (those aircraft) as such” van der Post explained, “so we’re just going to continue to sell the sector as an A320 and then sometimes replace it with A380, and the same with Stockholm and the 787.”

However, van de Post allows that once the airline “starts building confidence (in the aircraft) we may do something else.”

“The trials will run for about a month, and after two weeks when we feel more confident we make make a bit more noise about it.”

Once the trials are complete, British Airways’ Boeing 787 will begin flights between London and Toronto on September 1, while the Airbus A380 will start a daily London-Los Angeles service on September 24.

October 1 will see BA’s second Dreamliner slot into the London-Newark route, with a second A380 flying to Hong Kong from October 22.

The A380 and Boeing 787 will also be seen in UK skies this month, but those flights won’t carry passengers.

“We’ll do some domestic runs runs but that’s more for training and safety reasons” van der Post said. “For example, we need to make sure there are diversion airports and that we can handle them at those airports.""

BA's 'on the ground' A380 trial

The very first trial of British Airways' A380 will take place this coming Monday, July 8, with a planeload of BA staff – although the superjumbo will remain firmly on the ground

""We will bring 469 volunteer colleagues in, get everyone boarded, then bring the aircraft around to the base, close the doors and do a complete 11 hour service, to go through the entire end-to-end process"" van der Post told Australian Business Traveller.

""We'll do two meal services, test the entire service routine, ask everyone to play with the IFE and really take us through the paces. We will do another one at the end of july and we will do the same with the 787, and that will hopefully give us some learnings, so we will have enough time change some things before we start flying to LA.""

Inside the British Airways Airbus A380

BA's twelve A380 superjumbos will carry 469 passengers across four classes.

Most notable about BA's superjumbo seating plan is that it splits business class over two decks – the first A380 configuration to do so.

The lower deck is the domain of 14 lush first class mini-suites, which BA promises will have ""extra personal and stowage space"" due to the A380's wider main deck compared to the current fleet of Boeing 747s and Boeing 777s.

Back behind the curtain will sit 44 Club World business class seats in a 2-4-2 configuration, followed by 199 World Traveller economy seats arranged 3-4-3.

Upstairs are a further 56 Club World business class seats in a new 2-3-2 layout over two mini-cabins.

There's also a compact World Traveller Plus premium economy cabin of 55 seats in a 2-3-2 configuration, plus 104 more World Traveller economy seats arranged 2-4-2.

BA has released a video providing the first glimpse of its A380 cabin and seats.

As Australian Business Traveller revealed last year, the superjumbo offers ""an evolution of the current seat"" in BA's Club World business class seat rather than an all-new design.

This includes a 2-3-2 arrangement and the alternating backwards-forwards design.

Of course, first class is as swanky as ever.

The video also shows the slim-line economy seats of the Word Traveller and World Traveller Plus cabins.

Inside the British Airways Boeing 787

BA's Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner will carry 214 passengers divided into the predictable mix of business, premium economy and economy, with the airline continuing the trend reported by Boeing of dropping first class.

35 Club World business class seats sit at the pointy end in a new 'triple' configuration of 2-3-2, the same as upstairs on the A380. The extra space to the side of centre seats also appears on the A380 upstairs.

That's followed by 25 World Traveller Plus premium economy seats laid out 2-3-2, and 154 World Traveller economy seats split 3-3-3.

Airline dumps plans for 840-seat 'all economy' Airbus A380 - Executive Traveller,"Wed, 31 Jul 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vYWlybGluZS1kdW1wcy1wbGFucy1mb3ItODQwLXNlYXQtYWxsLWVjb25vbXktYWlyYnVzLWEzODDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The terrifying vision of 840 passengers crammed into an Airbus A380 has receded somewhat, with French carrier Air Austral abandoning plans for two A380s outfitted in an all-economy configuration.

The sardine-mode superjumbo would have nixed first, business and even premium economy cabins in order to maximise the number of passengers from tip to tail.

However, Air Austral's CEO tells APEX's Will Horton that flying A380 without any premium seats would starve the airline of higher-paid passengers who traditionally help subsidise the cheap seats.

“That’s going to affect the profitability, which is already at stake"" says Marie-Joseph Malé, who predicts the move would ultimately ""endanger the existence of the airline.""

Garuda Indonesia recently revealed it's considering a ‘convertible' version of the Airbus A380 – along with the Boeing 747-8I – which could be transformed into all-economy aircraft during off-peak travel seasons.

All business class seats would be temporarily removed and replaced with economy seats, for a maximum capacity as high as 850 seats in the A380.

“Both these aircraft have this ‘quick change’ feature for converting business class into all economy class in two weeks” Garuda Indonesia CEO Emirsyah Satar told Australian Business Traveller earlier this month, adding that “we would order the aircraft with a minimum of two classes” to facilitate the change.

Supersizing the superjumbo

Airbus is already tempting potential A380 buyers with a 600-seat A380, an increase of 22 percent over the current layout, with the possibility of 11-abreast seating in economy.

The new floorplan available to A380 buyers boasts 558 seats spread across a standard three-class configuration of first, business and economy, compared to today’s 490 seats in the same mix.

“You can even go beyond 558 seats if you take away first class and do a two-class layout, and you get another five rows (of economy)” says Christopher Emerson, Airbus’ Senior Vice-President of Marketing.

That would boost the tally to 598 seats for a 22% increase on the standard 490-seat Airbus 380.

BA, part of International Airlines Group, which received the first of its lightweight Boeing Dreamliners in June, will become the first airline in Europe to fly both new planes when it launches passenger services with the two planes in September.

The aircraft are the centrepiece of a 10-year, £9.82 billion (€10.8 billion) upgrade to BA’s long-haul fleet, which will include retiring the older and less fuel-efficient Boeing 747-400 jumbos.

“Over the next 12 months we will take delivery of new long-haul aircraft at an average rate of one every two weeks,” said BA chief executive Keith Williams.

BA has 12 A380s and 42 Dreamliners on order for delivery over the next 10 years.

BA’s fleet modernisation program also includes orders for six new Boeing 777-300ERs along with 18 Airbus A350 jets.

BA’s long-haul fleet has put it at a “cost and quality” disadvantage to rivals, especially deep-pocketed Middle Eastern carriers such as Emirates, with newer, more cost-effective planes that are also more comfortable with superior facilities, according to Davy analyst Stephen Furlong.

IAG will need to wring all the profit it can get from its new jets if operational problems at its Spanish carrier Iberia continue to wipe out progress at BA.

IAG, Europe’s third-biggest airline group by market value, had an operating loss of €278 million in the year’s first three months, with Iberia contributing €202 million of that as it suffered from competition from low-cost rivals and high-speed trains and labours disputes.

BA broke even during the quarter, helped by strength in business and first-class traffic.

The two new planes also promise more fuel-efficient flying and significantly reduced noise at the carrier’s Heathrow hub.

Their arrival will be welcomed by bosses at Heathrow who plan to name and shame airlines found guilty of breaking noise limits as the airport seeks to win more public support for plans to build a third runway.

Noise produced by airlines using Heathrow affects 700,000 local residents, according to Britain’s Civil Aviation Authority, more than any other airport in Europe. This has held back the airport’s campaign for expansion.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8928224444389343}",positive,0.8928224444389343,1
China Southern's Kangaroo Route combo: Airbus A380 + Boeing 787 - Executive Traveller,"Wed, 24 Jul 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vY2hpbmEtc291dGhlcm4tcy1jYW50b24tcm91dGUtY29tYm8tYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtYm9laW5nLTc4N9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"China Southern is set to serve up its two newest flagship aircraft on the Sydney-London route from October 27, tempting travellers with both the Airbus A380 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner on each leg of the 23 hour trip.

Provided passengers can overcome any nervousness regarding the trouble-prone Boeing 787, the lure of flying on both aircraft will be another factor in favour of China Southern's 'Canton Route' as it lines up in the ranks of Kangaroo Route contenders.

Read: The other Kangaroo Routes – eight one-hop ways to get to London

China Southern's superjumbo will carry 506 passengers in first, business and economy class from China Southern's hub in Guangzhou, with flight CZ326 leaving Sydney at 9.50am to reach Guangzhou at 5.30pm.

After an overnight short stopover in Guangzhou it's time to continue your journey to London on one of China Southern's new Boeing 787s.

The Dreamliner departs Guangzhou at 9.05am (flight CZ303), arriving in London at 3.25pm.

But you'll need to be a bit flexible with your travel schedule.

First of all, the Guangzhou-London Dreamliner service will initially run only five days a week, skipping Mondays and Wednesdays.

And with only 228 seats on the Boeing 787 – some 278 less than the Airbus A380 – there could be a few days between flights in order to snare a seat on the superjumbo.

This is probably a good time to mention the new visa-free transit rules which come into effect from August 1st and let you stay in bustling Guangzhou, or any city in the Guangdong Province – including Shenzhen – for up to 72 hours without a Chinese visa.

When it's time to head home, the London-Sydney flight is a fairly seamless affair.

Catch China Southern's Boeing 787 CZ304 flight out of London at 10.35pm, wheels-down in Guangzhou at 5.35pm – three hours later you're back in the air on the daily A380 service to Sydney (CZ325), which lands at 8.30am.

All business class seats would be temporarily removed and replaced with economy seats, for a maximum capacity as high as 850 seats in the A380.

“Both these aircraft have this ‘quick change’ feature for converting business class into all economy class in two weeks” Garuda Indonesia CEO Emirsyah Satar told Australian Business Traveller, adding that “we would order the aircraft with a minimum of two classes” to facilitate the change.

“We are looking at both aircraft now to see which is more efficient for us” Satar said.

The Indonesian flag-carrier expects to place an order for either the A380 or 747-8I by year’s end, primarily to ferry Muslims from Jakarta to Saudi Arabia during the Hajj and Umrah religious pilgrimages.

Indonesia is the world’s most populous Muslim state, but while these big birds would be fitted with both business class and economy cabins during those high traffic periods, Garuda wants the flexibility outside those peak travel seasons to maximise the number of bums on seats.

“Saudi Arabia doesn’t issue any visas before or after the three-month Haaj period” Satar said, “so there is basically no traffic at all. That gives us time to put the aircraft in hangar and convert them.”

Satar expects the converted aircraft would then “fly to the Middle East and also the growing market in China and Japan.”

Airbus is already tempting potential A380 buyers with a 600-seat A380 using a two-class configuration.

The A380 vs 747-8I decision is part of a larger fleet review to determine Garuda’s needs through to 2025, which also puts the Boeing 787, 777X and Airbus A350 on the slate.

However, Satar said he has no plans to begin flights to the USA, choosing to focus instead on growing the European and Asian market.

“In terms of Indonesia, the US is not a very big market” he explained.

“We prefer to be more dominant in Europe – we have London and Amsterdam, we will also fly to Germany – either Frankfurt or Munich, we have not decided – and either Rome or Milan, so we will be more concentrating more on this.”

The flagship aircraft – with wings made in Airbus’ North Wales Factory in Broughton, will fly on routes from London Heathrow to Los Angeles and Hong Kong.

The news comes just weeks after the milestone maiden flight of Airbus’ new A350 XWB aircraft, and a successful display to the Paris International Airshow where the company took orders and commitment to ordering aircraft to over £40billion. The orders will strengthen the busy order book of the Broughton wing factory and secures the jobs of the 6,000 strong employee roster.

During his recent visit to the Paris Air Show, the Secretary of State for Wales took the opportunity to visit the Airbus stand, and today welcomed the news that the largest passenger aircraft on the market has been delivered to an UK operator.

Secretary of State for Wales, David Jones said:

To see the flagship Airbus A380 in BA livery is a proud moment for everyone in the aerospace industry in Wales – none more so for those employees in North Wales who manufactured the ‘made in Wales’ wings that will fly thousands of people around the world every year.

Aerospace is one of our most important manufacturing industries, with Britain leading the way in Europe. The standard of British engineering ingenuity that has gone into the development of this, and all other aircraft in the Airbus roster, is testament to the talent and skills that we have in our aviation workforce.

NOTES TO EDITORS:

*Airbus currently has 262 firm orders for the A380, from 20 customers. Aside from its 12 firm orders, British Airways also has options for a further seven aircraft.

*All BA’s A380s will be powered by Derby-built Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines. An A380 with Rolls-Royce engines is around 40 per cent British made, with around 20 per cent of the airframe alone being manufactured in the UK.

*There are some 1,200 UK staff working directly on design and manufacturing the A380 at Filton and Broughton, with a further supply chain of 400 companies across the UK.

As career make-or-break moments go, spare a thought for British Airways Captain James Basnett yesterday. Not only was he flying his airline’s latest new ‘boys’ toy’ – the £300m double-decker Airbus A380 superjumbo flight BA9158 – which he was delivering from the factory in Toulouse to BA’s engineering headquarters at Heathrow.



But he also had his big boss in the back seat of the world’s largest commercial jet, along with up to 50 VIP guests and a small but no less eagle-eyed group of journalists eager to seize on any perceived crack in the façade. So no pressure.



‘You’ve never seen a bigger smile on the face of a captain in your life’, Captain Basnett said just seconds after its vast rubber tyres kissed the tarmac to a spontaneous burst of applause from passengers.



Boys' toy: Heathrow takes delivery of the £300m double-decker Airbus A380 superjumbo.

But Captain Basnett – and BA’s chief executive Keith Williams – can for the moment breathe a sigh of relief. For the Airbus has landed. And for Williams, who has now added the first of 12 superjumbos to the BA fleet he is ‘refreshing’, the question could well now be: ‘Does my BA look big in this?’ Indeed it does.

BA is now a significant part of the International Airlines Group, a low-key title for the ambitious umbrella group that encompasses BA and Iberia and which has BA’s former boss Willie Walsh at its helm.



If feisty pilot Walsh carries the mantle of a wartime leader – just think of the bitter battles he had with the cabin crew union BASSA before peace was re-established – Williams seems to have a demeanour more suited to post-war reconstruction.



All aboard: British Airways chief executive Keith Williams (centre) with stewardess Jade Podmore (right) and Captain Charles Everett (left).

That’s not to say he’s a pushover. Far from it. He was in charge of the purse strings as finance director during the hostilities.



Jumbo ambitions: The Airbus A380 at Heathrow

But the 57-year-old father of two now has the challenge of winning the peace in just as important a way that Walsh won his war.

Under Williams’s watch BA has becomes the first UK airline to take delivery of the new double-decker ‘superjumbo’ which he said heralded ‘a new era’ for the airline.

Passengers will find it bigger, more spacious, more comfortable, quieter and ‘greener’ than the ageing Boeing 747 jumbo jets it replaces. It is part of BA’s five-year, £5bn investment plan to refresh its fleet with 52 new aircraft including the Airbus’s new rival Boeing 787 ‘plastic plane’.



The A380 – whose high-tech British-built wings support up to 100,000 UK jobs – was shown off alongside a Boeing 787 Dreamliner at the Hatton Cross site.



British Airways is also the first airline in Europe to operate both the Airbus A380 and the rival Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the first two of which landed at Heathrow last week. It has ordered 12 A380s for delivery by 2016, of which three will arrive this year followed by a further five in 2014.



Williams said: ‘These aircraft are the start of a new era for British Airways. Over the next 15 months, we will take delivery of new aircraft at the rate of one a fortnight as we put ourselves at the forefront of modern aviation.



In control: British Airways chief executive Keith Williams in the cockpit of his new Airbus A380 superjumbo.

‘The A380 is a fantastic aircraft and an excellent showpiece for British engineering. Our customers are going to love the space, light and comfort on board.’



Williams added: ‘We will take delivery of 52 new aircraft between 2013 and 2017. And beyond that we are already planning the arrival of the A350-1000 and 787-10.’



Mention BA, and Heathrow is never far behind. The Government has kicked into touch until after the next election any definitive decision on a way forward.



Williams says there has to be a ‘hub’ airport. He clearly wants Heathrow to be it. But events have created for BA a breathing space, he believes.



New horizons: The A380 boasts luxury to match its huge scale.

First, the acquisition of BMI’s landing slots mean they can do more long-haul, especially to China. Second, the purchase of bigger aircraft such as the A380 and the Boeing 787 Dreamliner relieves capacity pressure. Together this will ‘see us through’ in the short term to about 2030.



Rising fuel costs are another concern but they are well hedged against any rise caused by Middle East instability and no further fuel surcharges are planned. Nevertheless, BA spends £3.5bn a year on fuel – and the A380 can cut consumption by around 20 per cent.



Its ‘noise footprint’ is a quarter of a jumbo jet’s, which means a quieter arrival to reduce opposition from anti-Heathrow expansion campaigners.



But while it may be BA’s first superjumbo, it is the 106th to be delivered, with rivals such as Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Qantas, Air France and Lufthansa getting in first.



Williams has had some recent embarrassments to deal with – such as the BA flight that sparked a mid-air drama over London after someone forgot to secure the cowlings on two engines. He firmly rejected any suggestion that maintenance standards might be slipping due to staff shortages.

The deal with Canadian manufacturer CAE, worth more than US$ 200m at list prices, will see Etihad Airways take delivery of its first Airbus A380 and Boeing 787 FFS, and will support the airline’s growing training requirements. In total Etihad Airways has ordered three Boeing 787 FFS, one Airbus A380 FFS, one Airbus A350 FFS, and two Airbus A320 FFS. All are CAE 7000 Series models. The airline currently has four CAE FFS: one Boeing 777, one Airbus A320 and two Airbus A330/340s. A multimillion dollar extension project is currently being undertaken at the training academy and is due for completion in early November 2013, with the first of the new FFS, an A320, scheduled for delivery later that month. The remaining FFS will arrive during the following 12 months. James Hogan, Etihad Airways’ President and Chief Executive, said: “The pilot training requirements for Etihad Airways, as well as members of our equity alliance, continue to grow and these new full flight simulators will ensure we are ideally placed for the next phase in our expansion. “We place great emphasis on the efficiency of our operations and the safety of our passengers and this deal means we will be using the most advanced training technologies for the broadest range of aircraft types. The construction work at the training academy will double its size and eventually house 11 full flight simulators and be among the best in the world.” The deal with CAE includes update services for the FFS and an exclusive 10-year agreement for training equipment and services. The flight training devices include CAE Simfinity Airbus Pilot Transition trainers and CAE Simfinity Integrated Procedures Trainers. CAE will continue to update Etihad Airways’ existing four CAE-built FFS to the latest aircraft configurations and technology. The technology includes the latest generation CAE Tropos 6000 XR visual system. H.E.

Abdulaziz bin Saleh Al-Aboudi, CEO of Thakher Development Company, reaffirmed his confidence in the Vision 2030 goal of attracting 30 million Umrah pilgrims annually by 2030, or even before that.

“The government has made huge efforts and provided comprehensive support to achieve the objectives of Vision 2030, aiming to accommodate 30 million Umrah performers and 6 million pilgrims by 2030. I believe these numbers will be achieved before 2030, based on the current capabilities we see. Therefore, as real estate developers, we must align our strategies with this direction,” Al-Aboudi said.

Al-Aboudi made these remarks during his participation in a panel discussion at the second edition of the Manafea Forum. The event took place under the patronage of Madinah Gov. Prince Salman bin Sultan and was hosted by Prince Saud bin Khalid Al-Faisal, deputy governor of Madinah.

During the session, the CEO highlighted the importance of allowing non-Saudis to invest directly and for the long term in listed companies owning real estate in Makkah and Madinah, as well as through licensed funds. “This trend contributes positively to the real estate market and the Saudi economy at large, paving the way for significant investment returns in the hospitality sector by 2030, and opening new avenues for development and investment,” Al-Aboudi said.

He said that work on the Thakher Makkah project is progressing well, in line with the expectations of investors and visitors alike, including pilgrims and Umrah performers. He said that, as part of this initiative, eight four-star hotels and hotel apartments have been developed, which will be managed by international operators. These facilities boast more than 2,276 rooms and 7,000 beds, providing high-quality services designed to fulfill the diverse needs of all visitors.

Thakher Makkah contributes to Saudi Arabia’s ambitious vision, which aims to host 30 million Umrah performers and 6 million pilgrims by 2030. The project spans an area of more than 320,000 square meters. Upon completion, it will include about 100 land plots of various uses for hotels, residential, commercial, and service-related areas. Residential and hotel apartment units will be available in various categories, including for ownership.

Thaker Makkah will be home to some of the biggest names in global hospitality including The Radisson Hotel, Park Inn by Radisson, and Novotel Hotel, which will be the largest in the world in terms of the number of rooms.

The company is also involved in developing the old neighborhoods of Makkah in coordination with the Royal Commission for Makkah City and Holy Sites to provide distinguished services to pilgrims.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9969580173492432}",neutral,0.9969580173492432,0
First Airbus A380 in BA fleet upgrade - IOL,"Fri, 05 Jul 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlvbC5jby56YS9idXNpbmVzcy1yZXBvcnQvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9maXJzdC1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1pbi1iYS1mbGVldC11cGdyYWRlLTE1NDI0MTfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rhys Jones London British Airways (BA) yesterday welcomed its first Airbus A380 jet, the world’s biggest commercial aircraft, as part of a $15 billion (R151bn) upgrade to top-of-the-range planes that it hopes will give it a boost in the lucrative market for long-haul business travel.

The emergence of the fuel-efficient double-decker jet through the grey clouds over Heathrow airport in west London was greeted by hundreds of BA staff and spectators, a boon to a group that has been weighed down by its ageing fleet. The plane touched down on time and taxied into a hangar near Heathrow terminal five, met by cabin crew in uniform waving British flags. The first long-haul flight on the A380 would run to Los Angeles in September, the British flag carrier said, earlier than the planned October start. “These aircraft are the start of a new era for BA,” said chief executive Keith Williams, noting that the airline had not had new long-haul aircraft for 17 years.

“Over the next 15 months, we will take delivery of new aircraft at the rate of one a fortnight as we put ourselves at the forefront of modern aviation,” he said. BA’s ageing long-haul fleet has put it at a “cost and quality” disadvantage to rivals, especially deep-pocketed Middle Eastern carriers, according to Davy analyst Stephen Furlong. BA, part of International Airlines Group (IAG), received the first of its Boeing 787 Dreamliners last month, making it the first airline in Europe to fly both new planes as commercial operations begin.

The aircraft are the centrepiece of a 10-year, $15bn upgrade to BA’s long-haul fleet, which will include retiring older and less fuel-efficient Boeing 747-400 jumbos. IAG will need to wring all the profit it can from its new jets if operational problems at its Spanish carrier Iberia continue to cut progress at BA. IAG made an operating loss of e278 million (R3.6bn) in the first three months of this year, with Iberia causing e202m of that as it suffered from competition from low-cost rivals and high-speed trains and labour disputes. BA broke even during the quarter, helped by business and first-class traffic.

BA has 12 A380s and 42 Dreamliners on order for delivery over the next 10 years. The A380 is built for use between major global airports, while the Dreamliner is for less busy routes and uses lightweight technology. Sales of the A380 have been slow over the past five years, with Airbus announcing 262 orders, of which 105 are now in service. Attention has turned to smaller, lighter planes such as the Airbus A350 and the Dreamliner. But Airbus executive vice-president of programmes Tom Williams saw a change as global growth picked up.

BA’s A380s, to carry 469 people, will go a small way to helping it cope with capacity constraints at Heathrow. Business lobby groups have said that Britain must boost flights to emerging economies. But plans for a third Heathrow runway were scrapped in 2010 when the government bowed to pressure from local residents and environmental groups. The arrival of the A380s will be welcomed by bosses at Heathrow who plan to name and shame airlines found guilty of breaking noise limits at the airport as it seeks to win more public support for expansion plans.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.593716561794281}",negative,0.593716561794281,-1
Secret of seat 25d: Get first class BA superjumbo legroom at economy prices - This is Money,"Fri, 05 Jul 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGlzaXNtb25leS5jby51ay9tb25leS9ob2xpZGF5cy9hcnRpY2xlLTIzNTY3ODQvU2VjcmV0LXNlYXQtMjVkLUdldC1jbGFzcy1CQS1zdXBlcmp1bWJvLWxlZ3Jvb20tZWNvbm9teS1wcmljZXMuaHRtbNIBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGlzaXNtb25leS5jby51ay9tb25leS9ob2xpZGF5cy9hcnRpY2xlLTIzNTY3ODQvYW1wL1NlY3JldC1zZWF0LTI1ZC1HZXQtY2xhc3MtQkEtc3VwZXJqdW1iby1sZWdyb29tLWVjb25vbXktcHJpY2VzLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The secret of seat 25d: How to get first class legroom at economy prices on BA's new superjumbo





The secret of seat 25d: Legroom that rivals first class at economy prices can be had on BA's new superjumbo.

If you fly long-haul on BA’s brand new double-decker Airbus A380, be ready to fight like fury for the best value seat by far.



For having flown on the delivery flight of the superjumbo from the Airbus factory in Toulouse to BA’s engineering centre at Heathrow, I can reveal that - by a long stretch - it is seat 25d in economy.

It has arguably more legroom than any business class seat, but at a fraction of the cost and this is a secret that could make the difference in securing a super comfortable seat for as little as a few hundred pounds rather than thousands.

The reason for 25d’s super-sized extra legroom is this.



The seat sits above, but just behind a special secret emergency exit flap which serves an under-floor cabin crew bunk room.



The outline of the flap is just visible on the floor in the photograph.

The bunk room itself is accessed by a cunningly disguised security door, which looks like a cupboard.



Once opened by secure code, cabin crew descend down a steep ladder into the underfloor ‘cellar’ rest-area which contains about a dozen double decker pod-like bunks.



Having descended into its cosy confines I thought it a fantastic party venue, which I’m sure sensible crew would find an outrageous suggestion.



Crucially for the savvy traveller, in the event of an emergency, there is a secondary escape hatch which emerges in front of seat 25d.

BA said seat 25d would only be made available to book 14 days before a flight and at a £50 mark-up, unless booked by Silver or Gold Card holders, who could book any time as ‘a reward’ for loyalty.

It means instead of paying thousands of pounds for some decent legroom, you’ll probably pay hundreds.

What’s so great about the A380?

HOW MUCH TO FLY ON THE FIRST SUPERJUMBO FLIGHTS?

BA said its first superjumbo long-haul return flight from London Heathrow to Los Angeles on September 24 is priced from £621 in economy to £2,550 in business and £3,799 in First. The first Hong Kong return on October 22 is priced from £688 in economy to £2,499 in business and £5,800 in First.

The new superjumbo has 469 passengers across four classes of cabin.

BA says its new £270million Airbus A380 takes it into a ‘new era.’ It is bigger, more spacious, more comfortable, quieter and ‘greener’ than the ageing Boeing 747 Jumbo jets it replaces – with fresher in-flight air to boot.

Passengers are promised a ‘clean, purer and draft free’ quality of cabin air thanks to a new filtering system which changes cabin air every three minutes and uses special air filters allow 15 different temperature control zones.



Flying in the lap of luxury: The new superjumbo promises travellers a greatly improved experience.

It does this by creating a ‘curtain of air’, which descends softly from the top to the bottom of the cabin from where it is re-filtered and re-circulated.

More than 238 feet long with a wingspan of nearly 262 ft, and 79 feet tall, it has a top speed of 587mph and a range of 9,755 miles.

It has a cabin crew the size of two football teams – 22 in all - and between two and four pilots depending on the length of flight.

The vast superjumbo can theoretically carry up to 800 people. But British Airways’ new A380s is making do with just 469 passengers across four classes of cabin – with lucrative First and Business class passengers paying a hefty premium for the privilege.

Legroom is 31 inches in economy, 38 inches in premium economy, there’s a 6ft long bed in business class (Club World) and a luxurious 6ft 6 inch long bed in First Class.



But the new economy seats have been cleverly designed to be thinner backed and hollowed out to increase seating space.

BA is the first UK carrier to take delivery of the world’s largest commercial jet.



It said the new aircraft’s innovative design means it is twice as quiet as a Boeing 747 Jumbo jet on take-off – and four times quieter on landing which may help placate some residents around Heathrow.



It is also 16 per cent more fuel efficient per seat than a Jumbo jet, and claims to be the ‘greenest’ passenger jet in the sky.

The frugal engines and design helps cut fuel consumption by around 20 per cent.



BA says a long haul plane might use £500million of fuel in its lifetime, which could mean a reduction of £100million.



A single long-haul flight might use £140,000 of fuel, which would mean a saving of nearly £30,000 per flight.



But will that be passed on to consumers as cheaper tickets?



Don’t hold your breath. In fact Mr Williams says passengers will pay a ‘premium’ to fly the new A380.

To avoid embarrassing dings the new BA A380 has two cameras to help the pilot see parts of the plane out of vision – especially when parking.



One on the tail showing the entire aircraft from above and one on the belly looking forward.

The airline has ordered 12 A380s for delivery by 2016 but it had to raise the roof of its hangars at Heathrow by around 12 feet to accommodate the new superjumbos.

BA chief executive Keith Williams who took part in the one and a half hour delivery flight to Britain said: ‘These aircraft are the start of a new era for British Airways.



Over the next 15 months, we will take delivery of new aircraft at the rate of one a fortnight as we put ourselves at the forefront of modern aviation.’

‘It is an excellent showpiece for British engineering. Our customers are going to love the space, light and comfort on board.’

Picture: Tim Stubbings/Maxim

She is the length of two blue whales, as tall as five giraffes, weighs 589tons and is causing a huge amount of attention as she circles in the skies above Kent.

Training flights on British Airways' first Airbus A380 have started in earnest after the super plane's arrival at Manston Airport on Monday.

A distinctive, but unmistakable, roar of her four Rolls Royce engines is already drawing many people outdoors to look skyward.

They are treated to a spectacular view of the A380's dark blue underbelly at relatively low heights following her local take-off and landing on two daily flights.

Plane-spotters can look out for the A380 - which costs £264million and is the world's largest commercial passenger aircraft - leaving Manston every morning at around 7am, returning between 11.15am and noon.

She will then depart again at 2pm, getting back between 6.15pm and 7pm.

Her route over the Kent coast takes her across the English Channel to France.There the A380 lands at a small airfield east of Paris, before taking off and landing again at Chateau Roux airport north of the French city and coming back to Kent.

The comings and goings of this spectacular ""monster"" of a plane will continue until the end of July, including weekends. They are all the more awesome for being incongruously quiet despite her awesome specifications.

The A380 can carry 469 passengers over two decks with four cabins, is 238ft (72.7m) long, 79ft (24.1m) high and 261ft (79.8m) wide.

Each A380 has more than 310 miles of wiring. The plane is rated as producing a quarter of the noise level of the Boeing 747 when landing.

It also produces 10% fewer nitrogen oxide emissions and is 16% more fuel efficient than the aircraft it replaces.

The A380's to-ing and fro-ing is also accounting for other phenomena: plane-spotters parked off road around Manston - binoculars and longlenses at the ready, and great Twitter activity.

The Kent international airport has been chosen by BA for training because of the accessible, capacious runway. It is 2,752m long and 61m wide.

Manston Airport chief executive Charles Buchanan on the A380. Picture: Tim Stubbings/Maxim

The training programme has demanded six months of extensive planning.

Seventy five senior BA pilots, all captains, will be training at Manston. They are all extremely experienced with at least 10,000 hours flying time each, and drawn from other BA fleets at British airports.

Their conversion from BA's existing fleet to the A380 has involved using a £10million state-of-the-art, high-tech static simulator at Heathrow.

It is owned uniquely in the UK by BA and uses large screens and computer graphics to give a virtual flying experience.

The Manston training is the final stage of pilot's preparations before BA's new fleet of A380s goes into service on longhaul flights in September.

BA cabin crew will also be training at Manston. Their focus will be on safety equipment and procedures, as they familiarise themselves with the cabin and the A380's distinctive layout and equipment, with airborne time on the Manston flights too.

BA spokesman Amanda Allan said: ""Because this is a much bigger aircraft than others in the fleet, it enables them to see and experience how it all physically works out. It is a really critical part of the preparation before we go into service, it takes huge planning.""

Taking off and landing practice is particularly important to meet the Civil Aviation Authority's stringent requirements.

BA is the first UK carrier to take delivery of the double-decker.

Today the A380 is flying between Manston and France. In September the real business will start with A380 flights from Heathrow to LA and Hong Kong with return prices starting at £621 and £688 respectively for return tickets.

BA has ordered 12 British-engineered A380s to arrive by 2016.

Anyone interested in tracking the A380 at Manston can do so via a number of apps, including flightradar 24. The flight number is BA380.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999972581863403}",neutral,0.9999972581863403,0

Flagship carrier British Airways has received its first Airbus A380 as part of its revamp of its long haul fleet.

BA is the first UK operator of the A380 and will start to deploy its 12 aircraft on routes from London Heathrow to Los Angeles and Hong Kong.

The first plane was flown this morning from Airbus’ delivery centre in Toulouse to the UK carrier’s home base at London Heathrow where the cabin is being unveiled.

BA chief executive Keith Williams said: “We’re delighted to be the first UK airline taking delivery of the A380.

“It is a great aircraft that has been developed with huge amounts of British engineering ingenuity and we believe it will prove very popular with our customers when it starts flying to its first destination of Los Angeles.”

Airbus President and CEO, Fabrice Brégier said: “It is a very proud moment for everyone at Airbus to see our A380 in the livery of British Airways, one of the world’s most pioneering airlines.

“With this new flagship in their fleet, the British carrier opens a new era of long-haul flying and offers its passengers an all-new travel experience.

“It is a special day for UK industry too, as a significant proportion of this amazing aircraft was designed and built at Airbus’ UK sites in Filton and Broughton, as well as at our many partners’ facilities across the country.”

Airbus employ 6,000 at its wing making plant in Broughton while local supply companies include the Metal Improvement Company in Broughton and Magellan Aerospace in Wrexham.

All BA’s A380s will be powered by Derby-built Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines.

An A380 with Rolls-Royce engines is around 40% British made by value. Airbus currently has 262 firm orders for the A380, from 20 customers.

The A380 is capable of flying 8,500 nautical miles or 15,700 kilometres non-stop, carrying more people at lower cost and with less impact on the environment.

The spacious, quiet cabin and smooth ride have made the A380 a firm favourite with both airlines and passengers, resulting in higher load factors wherever it flies.

To date some 40 million passengers have already enjoyed the unique experience of flying on board an A380. Every five minutes, an A380 either takes off or lands at one of the 30 airports where it operates today and the network is constantly growing.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997370839118958}",neutral,0.9997370839118958,0

South African Rugby player, Bryan Habana, pushed himself to new heights as he went up against British Airways’ brand new superjumbo, the Airbus A380.

Habana, who famously raced the cheetah in 2007 to save them from extinction, took on a new challenge racing British Airways’ ‘new animal’ in a 100m race.

Weighing in at 95kg with a height of 1,80m, Habana is pictured preparing to race British Airways’ superjumbo of 366,000kg, with a height of 24m, a wingspan of 80m and 73m in length.

Manston Airport has today welcomed the world’s largest commercial passenger aircraft - British Airways’ first Airbus 380.

The plane’s arrival at just after noon strengthens the role of east Kent’s international airport as a contender in the South East aviation debate.

The new addition to BA’s fleet will be based at Manston as part of the airline’s training for its pilots, flight crew and cabin staff before the A380s enter service in September.

Each A380 aircraft can carry 469 passengers over two decks with four cabins. The A380 is rated as producing a quarter of the noise level of the Boeing 747-400 when landing.
