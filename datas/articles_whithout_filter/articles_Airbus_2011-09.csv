Flight Review: Flying KLM Airbus A330 from Rwanda to Amsterdam - Airline Reporter,"Fri, 16 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMS8wOS9teS1yZXZpZXctZmx5aW5nLWtsbS1haXJidXMtYTMzMC1mcm9tLXJ3YW5kYS10by1hbXN0ZXJkYW0v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When flying out of Kigali, Rwanda, it is best if you have a lot of patience — there is a lot of waiting in lines. I got to the airport about five hours early, so I was prepared to wait. I figured it wouldn’t be a big deal, since I read there was free WiFi in the front lobby, which consists of only a coffee stand and a few seats. Unfortunately, the WiFi was not working, so I got myself a cold drink and started going through all my photos from my trip to Rwanda.

Passengers are not allowed to leave the lobby area to go to the ticket counters until it is two hours or less before your flight departs. Once I reached the two hour mark, I was able to go outside and wait in-line to go through the first set of security. Since three flights were leaving about the same time, a large group gathered outside waiting to get back inside. Before getting back inside we all had to have our documents reviewed and since I did not have access to a computer, I had to show my passport and my confirmation on my smart phone. I was given some looks, but they still let me through where I had to wait in another line to be screened. The first security screening was much like in the US, where I had to take off my shoes and take out my laptop.

After I went through security, I headed to the ticket counter, but was stopped by a security agent and told I had to go back and wait in a second line to have my passport scanned and my documents reviewed again. Sigh…okay.

After waiting about 15 minutes in that line, my documents were checked and I was finally allowed to wait in the ticket counter line. I was previously given a center seat, not something I wanted to have for a 10 hour flight. Luckily, I was able to get a window seat, so I thought I was set and headed towards the gate.

I followed signs telling me to head upstairs to get to the gate waiting area. On top of the stairs there was another, yet short, line for customs. They checked my forms, asked me a few questions and off I went to another waiting area, but this was still not the gate.

I was now in another waiting area with only 32 seats and a small bar area. Although outside it was cool, the upstairs waiting area was hot. There was a very small, maybe 19″, TV playing something not in English in front of the seats, but there weren’t enough for me to sit down. After a while we were allowed to move through another security check point to wait in a larger waiting area, which would be our departure gate.

Yes! After a six hour wait at the airport, our KLM Airbus A330 had arrived and we were told to start lining up. I knew there were no jet-ways, but I wasn’t sure if we would be bussed out to the plane or able to walk from the door to the plane; I was hoping for the walk. At the terminal door, we had our documents checked again and out onto the tarmac we went — sweet, no bus.

Kigali Airport is small and it was neat walking along the tarmac seeing a Brussels A330 and KLM A330 both in the middle of Rwanda sitting next to RwandAir’s two 737s and two CRJ200s. After having my documents checked one more time at the bottom of the stairs, I was on board the A330 and ready to find my seat.

Normally, I am aware where my flight came from and where it is going. However, I just received my itinerary for my flight home the day prior and with limited internet access, I had no idea. It didn’t seem like there were many folks in the waiting area to fill up an Airbus A330, so I did not know what to expect when getting on to the aircraft or even if we would have a few stops between KGL and AMS. When boarding, it became clear the aircraft had come from somewhere and I was guessing it was a long flight since the plane was full and people looked tired and grumpy.

Turns out the flight had some passengers from Amsterdam, but was heading to Entebbe, Uganda (EBB) from KGL. It was pretty lame, since the person who had had my seat obviously had just gotten off. It was still warm and there was trash everywhere. However, I was told it would be a quick 35 minute flight to EBB where the aircraft would be fully cleaned.

I did not have far to go to find my seat. I was sitting in seat 15A which was in the KLM Economy Comfort section located near the front. This gave me priority boarding, a few inches of additional leg room and more recline. It was nice, but there was an in-flight entertainment computer under the seat in front of me, eliminating half of my leg room. I thought with the big box in the way, I would at least have an outlet, but there was no in-seat power which was very disappointing. Kigali Airport is not known for the abundance of power outlets and by the time I boarded my electronics were needing some juice.

KLM definitely has their official color of blue down. Not only is the outside of the airplane blue, but the carpet is blue, the seats are blue, the bulkheads are blue and the flight attendants are all wearing a bright blue. When the flight attendants have their dress jackets on, the blue seems almost a bit overpowering and almost feels like I am on the official airline of the Smurfs. Good thing I like blue.

The aircraft loaded up quickly and we were ready to head to EBB. That was the shortest wide-bodied flight I have taken. It was just enough time for the flight attendants to run up and down the aisle to give us orange juice boxes and sit back down.

By the time we landed in EBB, it was obvious that the flight attendants were done with their shift. Along with the passengers, they came across as very tired and grumpy. This was okay, since they got off in Uganda and a new, fresh crew got on board.

During the layover, there were not too many of us left on the plane and a cleaning crew came on and worked around the passengers. It was interesting to see them in action, but it was obvious they were annoyed that so many passengers were in the way… I do not blame them. We had only been on the plane for about 40 minutes and passengers were out of their seats and walking around, getting in their way like we had just completed a marathon flight.

During the down time, it got amazingly hot inside the aircraft. The information screen showed it was only 73F outside, but it had to be over 85F inside the aircraft. The unfortunate part was the gentleman in front of me, apparently had made a life decision not to wear deodorant.

I am not quite sure why they weren’t able to run the APU and A/C while we waited and I heard multiple passengers complain, but the cabin did not seem to cool down until we started boarding again. Maybe it was an oversight with the changing of the crew, but after working up a nice sweat, I wasn’t able to cool down until almost landing in AMS.

Every economy seat has its own in-flight entertainment which is nice. The system seems a bit old and takes a little more time to navigate, but it is all free, which makes it worth the trouble. There is a decent selection of movies and TV shows in a number of different languages. It was entertaining enough for a one-way ten hour flight, but if you had more than that, the entertainment would get stale pretty quickly.

Talking about stale, we were served some hot food during the trip and a choice between beef and pasta — I chose the beef. I guess “stale” might be an unfair way to describe the food, it was not that bad, but not that great either. It is what one would expect from economy food from an airline.

I was actually quite surprised how quickly the flight went. I watched some movies, got some sleep, ate some food and BAM we were heading into Amsterdam. I think even though part of my legroom was taken by the in-flight entertainment system, the extra room and recline really helped. It was a little frustrating when the person in front of me decided to recline their seat all the way (remember Economy Comfort has the ability to recline more), but being by the window with only another seat next to me, with a few inches of extra room made the flight enjoyable.

After landing, I had a four hour layover in Amsterdam before flying on a Delta Airbus A330 back home to Seattle. I will be reviewing that flight in the near future.

New Composite Airbus Approaching Final Assembly - WIRED,"Tue, 06 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS8yMDExLzA5L25ldy1jb21wb3NpdGUtYWlyYnVzLWFwcHJvYWNoaW5nLWZpbmFsLWFzc2VtYmx5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Several large composite pieces for the new Airbus passenger jet have been delivered over the past month as the airplane maker prepares for assembly of the first A350XWB. The new airplane is expected to make its first flight some time next year and is a competitor against Boeing's 787 Dreamliner. Both the A350XWB and 787 feature significant use of composites. But each company chose very different ways to incorporate the materials into the airframe.

The upper cover for the wing is pictured above being loaded into the famous Airbus Beluga transporter. The company says it is the largest single piece made of carbon fiber used in the civil aviation market. The upper wing cover is flying today from Germany where it is fabricated, to the wing assembly plant in the United Kingdom. Earlier this month Airbus delivered the composite central wing box and fuselage keel beam to its fuselage assembly plant in France.

Airbus plans to fly the A350XWB for the first time in 2012. Slightly larger than the 787, the A350XWB also features composites throughout the design. In addition to the composite wings and tail sections, both airplane feature composite fuselages, though they are built using different techniques.

The 787 uses single piece composite barrels that are joined together lengthwise to form the fuselage. Airbus initially planned to use traditional aluminum structures for the fuselage of the A350, but opted to go with composite panels over a composite frame for the fuselage. The method of construction is similar to current aluminum airliners, but with just four large composite panels for each section. The two sides, top and bottom panels will form an ovoid fuselage on the A350XWB.

Airbus says it has 567 orders for its new airplane and hopes to deliver the first one in 2013. The first of 821 787 Dreamliners on order is expected to be delivered later this month.

Exclusive: Airbus deploys HP containers for world's largest commercial HPC data center - DatacenterDynamics,"Mon, 26 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYXRhY2VudGVyZHluYW1pY3MuY29tL2VuL25ld3MvZXhjbHVzaXZlLWFpcmJ1cy1kZXBsb3lzLWhwLWNvbnRhaW5lcnMtZm9yLXdvcmxkcy1sYXJnZXN0LWNvbW1lcmNpYWwtaHBjLWRhdGEtY2VudGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Archived Content The following content is from an older version of this website, and may not display correctly.

In the final phase of a four-year high-performance computing (HPC) deployment, Airbus has taken delivery of two HP PODs, making this the world's largest industrial HPC system and one of the first confirmed commercial HPC container contracts. This deployment is the 29th biggest computer in the world according to the official TOP500 Supercomputer list published on June 20.

Manufactured and tested by HP, the modular HP PODs were delivered to Airbus sites in Toulouse, France, and Hamburg, Germany.



Each POD contains all the elements of an HP Converged Infrastructure, including servers, storage, networking, software, management, and integrated power and cooling. A total of 2,016 clustered HP ProLiant BL280 G6 blade servers enable the two 12 meter-long containers to deliver the equivalent of nearly 1,000 square meters of data center space.

The HP PODs have enabled Airbus to quickly expand data center capacity, boosting computing performance for aircraft development while saving space and energy. Compared to an installation in a nearby customer data center, the water-cooled HP PODs consume up to 40 percent less power. With a near-optimum Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) rating of 1.25 from The Green GridÔäó consortium,(1) Airbus decreased operating expenses while delivering power capacity in excess of 15 KW/m2.

HP Enterprise Services provides data center services for Airbus, while HP Technology Services managed the transportation, deployment and commissioning at the customer site. For this project, HP managed the preparation of the new infrastructure, the technology decisions and the technical elements of the transition.

HP Converged Infrastructure is a key foundation of the Instant-On Enterprise. The Instant-On Enterprise embeds technology in everything it does to serve customers, employees, partners and citizens with whatever they need, instantly."

These airports have four airlines flying A380s to/from them. London Heathrow and Hong Kong have three airlines flying A380s to/from them.

A380 current and upcoming destinations: Sep-2011 (partial*)

Half of the world's 30 busiest international airport have A380 service - the rest coming soon

Fifteen of the world's 30 busiest airports by international traffic have A380 operations at present. Four more - Amsterdam Schipol, Munich, Kuala Lumpur and Rome Fiumicino - will have A380 services added under the upcoming Northern Winter schedule.

Most of the remaining leading international airports without A380 services are capable of handling the aircraft. Several airports - such as London Gatwick - have been actively wooing airlines to bring in A380s.

As of Aug-2011, the A380 was cleared to operate to over 130 airports worldwide. Given the size of the aircraft and some of its specialised needs in terms of air traffic separation and runway, taxiway, gate and aircraft parking requirements, this is a significant destination pool. But with almost all carriers but Emirates having placed small orders for the A380, they will likely continue to concentrate their A380 operations on a small selection of those 130 airports, especially when it is considered some long-haul routes require more than one aircraft per daily rotation.

A380 services at the world's 30 busiest airports by international traffic (as at Sep-2011)

The world's busiest airport (total domestic + international passengers) Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson, is notably absent from the list of A380 airports, although that will change with the introduction of service by Korean Air from 2012. Other major airports in the top 30 (in terms of international and domestic) with A380 services include Beijing Capital, Shanghai Pudong and Sydney.

Changing strategy and operational patterns

Early operators such as Emirates, Singapore Airlines and Qantas deployed the aircraft on long-haul, premium oriented routes. Their route strategies maximised the scarcity and novelty value of the aircraft for passengers, as well as its efficiency and capacity. As more aircraft have entered service and more carriers join the operating roster, the A380 route network and its role in airline network planning has slowly begun to fill out. This will continue as airlines like Emirates and Qantas take delivery of A380 aircraft configured with more seats than their existing A380 fleet. Such configurations less reliant on premium passengers will see the A380 open secondary premium markets or markets more targeted towards leisure traffic.

Emirates - leading A380 strategy

Emirates, the largest A380 operator with 16 aircraft in service (as of 25-Sep-2011) and 74 more in order, has been one of the leaders in this changing strategy. As the global financial crisis bit into corporate travel budgets in 2008 and premium and business travel dropped, the airline showed its flexibility by pulling the A380 off its flagship Dubai-New York route. It re-deployed the aircraft to Bangkok and Toronto - destinations that suited the higher capacity of the aircraft.

Despite the relatively small size of the city, Toronto is a particularly strong example for Airbus' case that the A380 can act as a congestion buster. With the UAE-Canadian bilateral air services agreement limiting Emirates to three flights per week, deploying the A380 allowed the carrier to boost its capacity into Toronto by around 420 seats per week without increasing the number of flights.

Shorter routes and somewhat smaller destinations are beginning to appear on the A380 route map, again with Emirates leading the strategic adjustment. Since Jan-2010, the Middle Eastern carrier has operated its 'medium density' configured A380s - with 517 seats - on the Dubai-Jeddah service, a sector of just three hours. This also helps Emirates increase the A380's utilisation rate as it would otherwise spend large amounts of time on the ground.

Emirates is awaiting clarity from the Indian Government on the possibility of operating A380s on high-yielding sectors into India, which it would like to do. Lufthansa has applied but not received permission to operate A380s into India.

Emirates is also pushing the aircraft into smaller airports. The carrier put A380s onto Dubai-Manchester service in Sep-2010 - replacing a B777-300ER - and has seen its traffic to the city hit record levels.

Korean Air makes cautious start

In Asia, Korean Air had a cautious launch of A380 operations in Jun-2011 by deploying the aircraft only to regional destinations (Tokyo Narita, Hong Kong, Bangkok). All Nippon Airways will take a similar approach with its B787s, initially using them regionally, whereas early A380 operators Emirates and Qantas immediately placed their A380s on ultra-long-haul routes. Launch operator Singapore Airlines confined its initial A380 operations to the Singapore-Sydney route before expanding to ultra-long-haul sectors. Such caution is not without merit as Emirates, citing engineering work, had to temporarily withdraw its A380 operations a month after the launch. Deployment on short sectors also permits staff, especially pilots, to quickly gain in-service experience.

Korean Air is continuing to shift some of the aircraft to long-haul destinations, including Paris CDG, Frankfurt, New York JFK and Los Angeles. However, it will continue to deploy the A380s into Japan and Hong Kong, further boosting the type's utilisation rate, as Emirates does with Jeddah and Singapore Air to Hong Kong. Korean Air's move demonstrates the A380 has intra-regional capabilities akin to its B747s and B777s that serve short regional flights in-between long-haul sectors, a common strategy replicated across major Asian carriers.

Singapore is also expanding its A380 operation with an announcement earlier this month that it plans to operate Singapore-New York JFK-Frankfurt service with A380s, as it phases out its final B747-400s.

With three new operators due to take delivery of their first aircraft in the next 12 months, and Airbus pushing production up to 35 aircraft per annum, the A380 fleet will continue to grow and the network strategies for the A380 will continue to develop.

China Southern to open first domestic A380 route

Next month China Southern Airlines will join the list of A380 operators. The carrier ordered its five A380s in 2005 and will operate the first service in mid-Oct-2011. It is the only Chinese airline to have ordered the A380, although an order expected from Hainan Airlines' subsidiary Hong Kong airlines failed to materialise at this year's Paris Air Show, reportedly due to Chinese government disapproval of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.

China Southern's addition to the A380 family will also see the first domestic scheduled routes operated with the type. The carrier is planning to operate Beijing-Guangzhou service from 18-Oct-2011, before switching to Beijing-Shanghai service on 27-Oct-2011.

Where the carrier will take the A380 internationally has not been formally announced, as the airline is still awaiting final CAAC sign-off for international services with the aircraft. Reports are that the airline plans to initially operate to Paris, followed by New York JFK, adding another two routes to destinations that already see significant A380 traffic.

The carrier will outfit its A380s in a three-class, 506 seat configuration. China Southern this month will officially unveil the seating arrangement, although seat maps have emerged via Chinese social media sites and been confirmed by the airline.

China Southern's A380s will feature eight first class and 352 economy class seats on the lower deck. The upper deck will have 70 business class seats at the front and 76 economy seats at the rear. The configuration has a high density of economy seats but a typical, for the A380, mixture of premium seats.

Malaysia Airlines to concentrate on Europe and Australia

Malaysia Airlines is due to get its first A380s in 2Q2012. The carrier was due to fit its A380 aircraft with 508 seats in four classes (eight first class, 54 business, 26 premium economy and 420 economy) although this is expected to change following reviews that commenced after AirAsia acquired a stake in the carrier. MAS is due to receive five aircraft in 2012 with the sixth and final A380 due in 2013.

Malaysia Airlines will continue in the long-haul, premium focused mould already established by other A380 operators. It has already announced its A380s will be primarily dedicated to high-yielding European routes - initially London Heathrow and Amsterdam, the first time an A380 will serve the Dutch city. Other routes under consideration are Sydney and Melbourne.

Like Malaysia Airlines, Thai Airways is due to join the A380 sorority in 2012 and has adopted a similar intercontinental focus for the aircraft. The carrier has six A380s on order, with its first two expected for delivery next year.

It has announced that it will initially deploy the aircraft to Frankfurt, with service expected to commence in Oct-2012. Following that Thai expects to serve London Heathrow and Paris CDG.

Appendix: Orders & Configurations

Airbus markets the A380 as the ""ideal solution to alleviate traffic congestion at busy airports"". According to the European manufacturer it is ""mega-cities"" - those featuring RPKs in excess of 5 billion p/a or 10,000 daily long-haul passengers - that will drive demand for very large aircraft (VLA) such as the A380. Globally, 39 cities currently meet these thresholds, but Airbus expects this to climb to 87 by 2029. More than 90% of global long-haul passenger traffic starts, terminates or goes through an aviation mega-city.

Mega-city growth will be concentrated by Asia, and it shows in the A380 order book. By 2030, Airbus forecasts 10 of the 20 largest VLA airports will be in the Asia Pacific (indicated by a light pink circle).

2030 VLA aircraft forecast

Airlines in the Asia Pacific account for nine of the 17 A380 customers. Over the next 12 months three more Asian airlines - China Southern, Malaysia Airlines and Thai Airways - will join the family of A380 operators, bringing new destinations and new strategies for the giant aircraft.

Airbus' most recent 20-year global market forecast, released in Sep-2011, raised the outlook for VLA orders from 1738 to 1781 aircraft. 45% of these aircraft are forecast to be delivered to customers in Asia, 23% to go to the Middle East and 19% to European airlines. North America and the rest of the world will purchase just 13% of VLAs, according to Airbus' predictions.

Configurations - trending toward greater seat density

With two full decks and a nominal design capacity of 525 seats in three-class configuration, the A380 offers airlines a wide number of options in terms of layouts. The aircraft has clear total seat capacity advantage over other long-range aircraft such as the A340-500/600, B777-300/200, B747-400 and even Boeing's new 747-8 Intercontinental, although the A380 is at a disadvantage when it comes to carrying freight.

Most of the inital A380 customers have proved reluctant to turn the aircraft into an economy class workhorse. Instead, the initial focus has been on the premium traveller. Early A380 configurations have featured lavish amenities, reminiscent of the B747 when it first entered service in the 1970s. Singapore Airlines' A380s boast first class suites with double beds, while Emirates A380s have showers. Several carriers offer bars and lounge areas. Korean Air has even outfitted its aircraft with an onboard duty free store.

Singapore Airlines' initial A380 configuration was just 471 seats, while Emirates, the the second A380 operator, had an initial configuration of 489 seats. A high benchmark may not be set until Emirates introduces a more dense configuration, or Air Austral around 2014 places into service its A380 configured with almost the maximum number of seats - 853 - the aircraft is approved for.

Bucking the trend is Singapore Airlines and Japan's Skymark Airlines. Skymark plans to operate the least dense configuration yet, with a total of 394 seats - approximately 15 seats less than current configurations from Korean Airlines and Singapore Airlines. Singapore Airlines in May-2011 took delivery of its first lower density A380 having 409 seats over its initial 471-seat configuration. The new configuration has 88 fewer economy seats in favour of 26 additional business class seats.

A380 operators seat configurations

500 - the magic number of seats?

As the novelty value of the aircraft has begun to wear off, the premium-focused seating configurations are gradually giving way to greater density layouts. Layouts between 500 and 550 seats, with 400-450 economy class seats, have become the norm.

Emirates has supplemented its initial layouts with a higher density configuration featuring more economy seats. It has also announced a high-density 644-seat layout, but has not equipped any of its aircraft in this configuration yet.

Qantas' A380s were introduced in Oct-2008, with 450 seats and the airline was the first to offer premium economy service. The Australian carrier announced last year its intention to abandon first class altogether for its last eight A380s that are now not due for delivery until FY2019. The carrier has opted for a split fleet, to give it ""greater flexibility to schedule the right aircraft, and the right configuration, on the right route, based on market demand"". The remaining eight A380 deliveries are due to feature business, premium economy and economy classes, although the exact combination has not been announced.

Lufthansa and Air France, which did not take delivery of their first A380s until 2009, both adopted initial configurations with more than 500 seats. China Southern, Malaysia Airlines and Thai Airways have all announced A380 configurations that feature just over 500 seats.

There is still experimentation with the aircraft though. Air Austral, the Reunion based French carrier, has announced it will configure its aircraft in an all-economy layout of ""around 840"" seats. After Air Austral announced the all-economy layout, Airbus COO congratulated the carrier on showing ""the potential of the A380 in the market of today and tomorrow"" and offering the real benefits of ""doing more with less"".

At the other end of the scale, Japanese LCC Skymark Airlines, is experimenting with an all-premium layout. The airline, which finalised its order for A380s earlier this year, has announced its A380 will feature just 394 seats, the lowest seating density of any operator to date. The carrier's aircraft will have 280 premium-economy seats on the lower deck and 114 business-class seats on the upper deck."

Airbus displayed an Airbus ACJ318, offered for VVIP charter by Comlux, at the Jet Expo in Moscow which took place 14-16 September.

This Airbus ACJ318 features the comfort and practicality of home and office, plus seating for 19 passengers, which is more than traditional business jets.

“Airbus corporate jets are similar in size to traditional business jets on the outside, but are around twice as big on the inside, allowing them to deliver a more comfortable space in which to travel, as well as the ability to carry more passengers.”



“They also benefit from being derived from the world’s most modern aircraft family,” comments Airbus Chief Operating Officer, Customers, John Leahy.

Airbus offers the largest family of corporate jets of any manufacturer, ranging from the Airbus ACJ318 all the way up to the ACJ380, allowing it to offer customers the comfort that they want in the size that they need.

The Airbus ACJ318 that will be displayed features a cabin with a floorspace of around 75 m2/800 ft2, which makes it similar in size to a reasonable size house or apartment.

It features a living area and an office that converts to a bedroom, plus two spacious bathrooms, giving passengers a ride that is comfortable and practical, as well as productive and relaxing.

Like all Airbus corporate jets, the Airbus ACJ318 features intercontinental range, allowing it to serve most destinations in Europe nonstop – as well as to reach much of the world with a single stop."
First A350 XWB wing lower cover delivered - Reinforced Plastics,"Mon, 19 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlaW5mb3JjZWRwbGFzdGljcy5jb20vY29udGVudC9uZXdzL2ZpcnN0LWEzNTAteHdiLXdpbmctbG93ZXItY292ZXItZGVsaXZlcmVkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The wing lower cover.

The wing lower cover was produced at Airbus’ Centre of Excellence for composite materials in Illescas, Spain, and is approximately 32 m long and 6 m wide.

The wing cover will be fitted into the A350 XWB wing in Broughton, UK, which will then transported to Bremen, Germany, where the movable parts will be fitted. The sub-assembly will eventually go to A350 XWB Final Assembly Line in Toulouse, France, where it will be joined to the fuselage.

The Airbus factory in Illescas, Spain, specialises in the automation of production processes of large composite airborne surfaces and fuselage sections. The factory also manufactures the skin of the rear section of the A350 XWB fuselage (a one-piece composite barrel section) as well as the tail planes, elevators and rudders for all Airbus models and fuselage sections and door components for the landing gear of the A380.

The A350 XWB family consists of three passenger versions offering 270-350 seats. To date, 35 customers have ordered 567 A350 XWBs. The first aircraft is scheduled for delivery in 2013."
Airbus Buys Supercomputers In HP PODs - Silicon UK,"Wed, 28 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpbGljb24uY28udWsvd29ya3NwYWNlL2FpcmJ1cy1idXlzLXN1cGVyY29tcHV0ZXJzLWluLWhwLXBvZHMtNDA3ODXSAVNodHRwczovL3d3dy5zaWxpY29uLmNvLnVrL3dvcmtzcGFjZS9haXJidXMtYnV5cy1zdXBlcmNvbXB1dGVycy1pbi1ocC1wb2RzLTQwNzg1L2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aircraft maker Airbus, is using two of HP’s pre-configured container-based data centres for supercomputing.

Airbus has effectively doubled its high-performance computing (HPC) power with the HP PODs (Performance Optimised Data centers), which were delivered to Airbus sites in Toulouse, France, and Hamburg, Germany.

Modular Approach

HP joined the modular data centre approach five years ago when it first began making its PODs. In October last year it announced it was creating specialised manufacturing facilities to build its PODs in both Europe and America, because of a major increase in its containerised data centre business.

Containerised data centres have been touted as a solution where people need temporary capacity, or in environments where there are no suitable buildings or time to build a permanent data centre. However, HP believes PODs can have wider applications, as they can be more energy efficient than most traditional data centres, with a PUE of 1.2, and can be assembled in weeks instead of months, and then shipped to wherever they are required.

HP meanwhile said this Airbus deal makes it the world’s largest industrial HPC system and one of the first confirmed commercial HPC container contracts. And according to the official TOP500 Supercomputer list, the Airbus deployment is now the 29th biggest computer in the world.

Energy Efficient

Essentially each POD c ontains all the elements a traditional data centre, using HP’s converged infrastructure. Indeed, HP said that a total of 2,016 clustered HP ProLiant BL280 G6 blade servers enable the two 12 meter-long containers to deliver the equivalent of nearly 1,000 square meters of conventional data centre space.

HP also said that its water-cooled HP PODs consume up to 40 percent less power compared to an installation in a nearby customer data centre.

This is because in June HP unveiled an even greener POD, which HP officials called the “EcoPOD”. The so called EcoPOD can be deployed in 12 weeks, costs 75 percent less to build, and apparently cuts energy costs by 95 percent.

Meanwhile HP continues to invest heavily in its data centre capabilities.

In February it extended its data centre design and planning expertise, to include the actual construction of the facility. HP said the service will streamline the process of building data centres and give enterprises one place to go for the entire process.

Prior to that it began offering a data centre education system last year with a training programme that included networking, storage, servers and software elements."

The best seats in first class on United's Airbus A320 - Executive Traveller,"Wed, 21 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vdGhlLWJlc3Qtc2VhdHMtaW4tZmlyc3QtY2xhc3Mtb24tdW5pdGVkLXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A320 is the mainstay of United's domestic US fleet, with nearly 100 of the planes in service -- more than any other type. You'll find it on many routes from United's hub at San Francisco's SFO airport that connect to and from Australia flights.

There are three rows of first class, similar to domestic business class in Australia, at the pointy end. You'll be booked into these seats if you crossed the Pacific in business class.

Economy Plus stretches behind first class for another six rows in front of Economy.

Economy Plus is regular Economy seats with a few inches of extra legroom, not proper Premium Economy. It's given out for free to elite tier frequent flyers, or for a fee to everyone else.

The first class cabin

United's first class cabin on the A320 contains twelve seats in a 2-2 configuration across three rows.

(Note that United's seat numbering changed earlier this year as part of its merger with Continental. Whereas first class used to be seats A & B on the left hand side of the aisle and C & D on the right, it's now A & B on the left and E & F on the right. So don't get caught out if you haven't flown United in a while!)

Seat pitch -- the space between your seatback and the one in front -- is 38 inches, which is standard for a domestic business/first class seat or international premium economy.

You'll find overhead video screens rather than individual entertainment screens on United's A320s, so make sure you bring something to do on the plane.

The best seats on the plane

1A, 1B: on some of United's A320s, these bulkhead seats have a few inches of extra legroom, since the wall in front of them has a small nook to give you a bit more space. (You won't find this extra space on all planes, but you've nothing to lose by choosing these seats and hoping for an extra-legroom plane.)

1E, 1F: while they're lacking the extra nook of the other seats in row 1, avoiding someone reclining back into you is a big plus.

The worst seats on the plane

Row 3: although the nice thing about having Economy Plus behind first class is that the passengers right behind you are less likely to be screaming babies, it's still possible. So pick seats further forward in the cabin.

Airbus aims to dominate China market - SKNVibes.com,"Wed, 21 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vbS5za252aWJlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXdzZGV0YWlscy5jZm0vNDI3NTLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Beijing, ZZZ) - Airbus aims to have more than half of the lucrative Chinese aviation market by the end of 2015, a senior executive said Wednesday, as the European giant seeks to close in on rival Boeing.

The plane maker currently holds 46 percent of the booming Chinese sector -- a smaller share than Boeing -- but senior vice president Eric Chen said it was on target to overtake its American competitor.

""If you look at the number of firm orders for planes, I am more than confident we will soon reach more than 50 percent, it's our target... before the end of 2015,"" Chen told AFP at the China International Aviation Expo.

China recorded 267 million air passenger trips in 2010, up 15.8 percent from the previous year.

According to figures published by the state-owned aeronautics giant China Aviation Industry Corporation (AVIC) Wednesday, Chinese airlines will add 4,583 passenger aircraft to their fleets by 2030 -- a boon for planemakers worldwide.

The number of air passengers in China has grown on average 15.3 percent annually over the past decade -- around three times the world average for the same period, it said.

Airbus is in direct competition with Seattle-based Boeing, which announced two weeks ago it would look to maintain its current 51 to 52 percent share of the Chinese market.

However, the China-made C919 jet -- expected to come into service in 2016 -- is set to provide extra competition for Boeing and Airbus in the medium-range sector, which represents 70 percent of the market.

Meanwhile, Chen said the delivery of Airbus' first A380 to a Chinese airline -- China Southern Airlines -- would take place on October 15.

According to the Oriental Morning Post paper, the jumbo jet will make its inaugural commercial flight in China between Beijing and Guangzhou in the south on October 17, and will go between Beijing and Shanghai from October 27 to 29.

It will then be used on an unspecified international route.

Chen also pointed to another long-haul plane -- the A330. He said Airbus had already sold around 120 of these in China, and ""before the end of 2015, we hope to sell up to 200 A330s, it's our target"".

Wang Baixue, deputy chief engineer at AVIC's aviation industry development research centre, said economic development, tourism and urbanisation would ""provide strong support for air transport in China"" going forward.

He said that between 2011 and 2030, AVIC estimated revenue passenger kilometres (RPK) -- a measure of the volume of passengers carried by airlines -- would grow 8.1 percent annually.

But Wang cautioned that the current development of China's high-speed trains would have an impact on air traffic.

""If the duration of the high-speed railway trip is under three hours, it will have an impact on air transport,"" he said.

""In total, that impact should be less than 10 percent. In other words, 10 percent of air passengers will choose to go by high-speed rail instead."""

Separate activities were conducted in mid-September to clear the European airlifter's high-energy rejected take-off test, and also on emergency evacuation procedures.

Performed on 17 September in Toulouse, France, using development aircraft MSN1, or ""Grizzly 1"", the braking system test involved accelerating the A400M to its V1 decision speed at its maximum take-off weight of 141,000kg (310,900lb), before aborting the take-off. The aircraft was taxied clear of the runway and stopped for 5min before firefighters were allowed to cool its brakes and wheels.

""As is typical in this test, three of the aircraft's tyres deflated,"" Airbus Military said in a 22 September statement. ""There was no further damage and the test was highly successful.""

Meanwhile, aircraft MSN6 was employed for emergency evacuation tests, undertaken over a series of days at the company's San Pablo final assembly site near Seville, Spain.

""All the tests required for certification were passed,"" Airbus Military said, citing activities as having encompassed the carriage of conventional troops and paratroopers, and in medical evacuation and mixed troop/cargo configurations.

The company has established a target of securing civil type certification for the A400M from the European Aviation Safety Agency before the end of 2011.

This is a key step towards it launching deliveries of the Europrop International TP400-D6-engined type in early 2013.

""These are vital tests to satisfy highly specific certification requirements,"" said Airbus head of flight operations Fernando Alonso. ""We look forward to more strong progress in the next few weeks.""

"Air France-KLM splits order between Airbus, Boeing - SKNVibes.com","Fri, 16 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNrbnZpYmVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ld3NkZXRhaWxzLmNmbS80MjA5M9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(PARIS, FRA) - Air France-KLM said on Friday it had split a mega order for 50 long-haul carriers evenly between Europe's Airbus and US rival Boeing, in a deal worth $11.3 billion (8.1 billion euros).

The giant Franco-Dutch airline is to order 25 Airbus A350-900s and 25 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners with options to buy another 60 planes to renew its fleet with more fuel-efficient, lightweight models.

The order has attracted huge attention in France, where some politicians have put pressure on Air France-KLM to buy from Airbus -- which has its major plant in Toulouse, in the south of the country -- rather than from Boeing.

The planes will replace Air France's A340 fleet and KLM's stock of Boeing MD-11s, although neither of the new models using lightweight composite components is yet operational.

The deal, to be finalised by the end of the year, also includes options to buy 60 more planes, 25 for Boeing, bringing the total number of potential sales to 110, in an order potentially worth $26.96 billion (19.5 billion euros).

Last week the airline's chief executive Pierre-Henri Gourgeon said the proposed deal was to replace planes that will reach the end of their service in 2018-2020.

Air France-KLM, which is 15.7-percent owned by the French state, has been under French political pressure to order from Airbus, including a petition signed by 180 MPs.

President Nicolas Sarkozy in June wrote a letter to an MP from his UMP party saying he ""was closely following the discussions between Airbus and Air France-KLM on upgrading its long-haul fleet"".

Sarkozy wrote: ""I am sure that Air France-KLM will of its own accord recognise the qualities of the A350, a plane whose production we have supported with loans.""

In a statement, the airline stressed that its decision was founded on the planes' technical characteristics and performance

""For its first joint order, Air France-KLM made its choice following a detailed evaluation that brought out all the advantages of each aircraft, notably their energy and environmental performances,"" Gourgeon said.

The first B787-9 will enter service with KLM in 2016 and the first A350-900 will enter services with Air France in 2018.

Airbus in July scored a victory against its US rival, when American Airlines announced a record order for 460 planes that included 260 Airbus aircraft, breaking Boeing's monopoly of its fleet.

That split order marked a major setback for Boeing, supplier of American's entire 600-plus plane fleet, which had not included an Airbus plane since 2009."

Flights from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) will commence on February 2, 2012 and from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) on March 1, 2012. The airline is also looking at possible expansions to Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia and Washington, DC.

Before 9/11 Emirates had plans to expand in the US, but their plans were put on hold due to lack of demand. Currently, Emirates is the world’s number one airline in international traffic and they feel it is time to increase service to the US.

’œWe’ve always had fairly ambitious plans for the U.S. and this is part of that,’ Emirates President Tim Clark told Bloomberg. ’œIt’s an immense market. There will be more to come, including increased frequencies and bigger planes. We have ideas for the East Coast, the north-south axis in the center and for the west.’

Emirates will operate their new flights from DFW and SEA using Boeing 777s, but the airline is speaking openly about using larger Airbus A380s on future US routes.

’œThe A380 will be an option for all U.S. operations post- 2013, when the plane will have a higher takeoff weight, so that routes such as Dubai-Los Angeles become a distinct possibility,’ he said. ’œAnd most U.S. airports are A380- capable or will be.’

Being based in Seattle, it is very exciting to hear that not only will a new airline start operations here, but that they are also contemplating using the Airbus A380 in the future. As of now, no airline operates the A380 to SEA and even with this announcement, it seems it could still take a while.

“We do not have any immediate plans to bring the A380 to Seattle, although this may be something we consider in the future,” Jim Baxter, Vice President North America, Emirates Airline explained to AirlineReporter.com via email. Even if Emirates was ready to operate the A380 to Seattle, the airport is not able to handle scheduled service of the world’s largest airliner.

“We can handle the A380 in emergencies, however we do not have facilities for regular use, such as the multiple gate loading ramps, for the aircraft,” Perry Cooper, SEA’s Media and Public Affairs Manager explained. “At this time, if an A380 were to arrive and need to access a gate, safety guidelines would require all traffic to stop until the aircraft stopped at its gate, due to the width of taxiways and safety zones next to the runways.”

The A380 is so large, that it would currently take up two of SEA’s gate configurations and due to the cost and lack of direct demand, the airport does not “currently have plans to expand to accommodate the A380.”
