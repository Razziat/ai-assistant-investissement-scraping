India's IndiGo places record order for 500 A320 Family aircraft - Airbus,"Mon, 19 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0wNi1pbmRpYXMtaW5kaWdvLXBsYWNlcy1yZWNvcmQtb3JkZXItZm9yLTUwMC1hMzIwLWZhbWlseS1haXJjcmFmdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"IndiGo, India’s largest airline by market share, has placed a firm order for 500 A320 Family aircraft, setting the record for the biggest single purchase agreement in the history of commercial aviation. The latest agreement takes the total number of Airbus aircraft on order by IndiGo to 1,330, establishing its position as the world’s biggest A320 Family customer.

The historic purchase agreement was signed by Rahul Bhatia, Promoter & Managing Director of IndiGo, Dr. Venkataramani Sumantran, Chairman and Non-Executive Independent Director of IndiGo, Pieter Elbers, CEO of IndiGo, Guillaume Faury, Airbus CEO, and Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer and Head of International, at the Paris Air Show 2023.

Pieter Elbers, CEO of IndiGo, said, “It is difficult to overstate the significance of IndiGo’s new historic order for 500 Airbus A320 Family aircraft. An order book now of almost 1000 aircraft well into the next decade, enables IndiGo to fulfil its mission to continue to boost economic growth, social cohesion and mobility in India. At IndiGo, we take pride in being India’s preferred airline for connectivity in and with India; and by doing so, being one of the leading airlines in the world. This order strongly reaffirms IndiGo’s belief in the growth of India, in the A320 Family and in our strategic partnership with Airbus.”

“This landmark order marks a new chapter in Airbus and IndiGo’s relationship that is democratising affordable air travel for millions of people in the world’s fastest growing aviation market. It is also a resounding endorsement of the A320 Family’s best-in-class operating economics that have been powering IndiGo’s growth for almost two decades. We cherish our long-standing relationship with IndiGo and are proud of our success together. We look forward to contributing to the growth of India’s air connectivity in its domestic network and into international markets through the expansion of this formidable partnership”, said Christian Scherer, Chief Commercial Officer and Head of International at Airbus.

New Delhi-headquartered IndiGo is among the fastest growing carriers in the world. Since its first A320neo aircraft was delivered in March 2016, its fleet of A320neo Family has grown into one of the world’s largest with 264 aircraft in operation (162 A320neo, 79 A321neo, 21 A320ceo and 2 A321 freighters. IndiGo placed its first order with Airbus in 2005 (100 A320 Family) and again in 2011 (180 A320 Family including the NEO), in 2014 (250neo Family), and in 2019 (300 A320neo Family) taking its previous total order book to 830 A320 Family aircraft.

Over the last two decades, the A320neo has been instrumental in democratising air travel in India as an expanding economy and rising disposable incomes continue to add millions of first-time flyers to a booming aviation market.

Worldwide, the A320 Family is the undisputed leader in the single-aisle aircraft category. The aircraft has the widest single-aisle cabin in the sky that incorporates the very latest technologies.

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury Reveals Plans for New-Generation Narrowbody - Aviation Week,"Wed, 14 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9zaG93bmV3cy9wYXJpcy1haXItc2hvdy9haXJidXMtY2VvLWd1aWxsYXVtZS1mYXVyeS1yZXZlYWxzLXBsYW5zLW5ldy1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLW5hcnJvd2JvZHnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The first Paris Air Show in four years comes at a pivotal time for Airbus. Demand for commercial aircraft is surging, as are supply chain and production delays. At the same time, Airbus is gearing up to develop new conventional and hydrogen-powered aircraft for the second half of the 2030s. The Russia-Ukraine war is affecting almost all parts of the industry and has led to a new sense of urgency in European defense policy. Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury discussed current challenges and the road ahead with Senior European Defense Editor Tony Osborne and Executive Editor for Commercial Aviation Jens Flottau.

Airbus is strongly engaged in open-rotor studies with CFM International

More partners for Future Combat Air System are needed

AW&ST: Airbus has been very public about its plans for a hydrogen aircraft. But to get to the net-zero emissions target by 2050, you will need a new, more efficient conventional aircraft at some point. What are your plans in this space? The net-zero road map relies on a number of necessary steps. There is very little room for not reaching milestones. The first one is that we need to significantly accelerate the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) in the short term, and reaching 10% [of fuel demand] by 2030 seems to be a necessary condition for where we need to be in 2050. We also need planes that are burning far less fuel than the previous generation.

What aircraft parameters are you working toward? We need a new generation of planes. We are preparing all the technologies for the plane, the production system, the digitalization of the plane and for using data to be able to fly the planes better. We have to be at 100% of SAF or close to 100% of SAF by 2050, not only technically but commercially as well. [This means having] planes that can fly economically under these conditions. We need aircraft that burn around 20-25% less fuel than what we are using today with the A320neo or the A321neo. That’s why we are preparing entry into service in the second half of next decade targeting 2035, maybe between 2035 and 2040.

Can you get away without interim steps before introduction of that new aircraft? Twelve years is a very long time. Well, no, it’s not a long time. The [Boeing] 737 started 50 years ago; the A320 entered the market 30 years ago. We are preparing the replacement of platforms, not upgrades. This is not going from A320 to [A320neo] or from the [737NG] to the MAX. Even though it seems like a lot of time, it means a launch of the program in 2027 or 2028, maybe 2030 at the latest. And we are just years away from those days where we need to have the technologies, all the partners ready, the suppliers [and] the industrial setup. That’s why we’ve been working a lot on the industrial setup at Airbus and why we are deploying [Digital Design, Manufacturing and Services] not only at Airbus but also at [aerostructures affiliates] Atlantic and Aerostructures.

Is the open-rotor engine a viable option for you? We want it to be a valuable option. And we’re working very closely with CFM to look at all the dimensions of flight or integration—of performance, of certification and so on—to decide whether this is a viable option or not. CFM strongly believes it’s viable. Our teams believe it is likely to be viable, but there are still a number of boxes that need to be ticked. We will be flight-testing the open alternative and will be working a lot on simulation and computation with CFM to look at all the dimensions of what it has to deliver, but yes, we consider it to be a promising technology.

Will the aircraft be comparable to an A320neo or A321neo in terms of size, speed and payload/range capabilities? It will come very close in terms of flight envelope—the range will be even better, [and] fuel burn is going to be excellent. Obviously, the diameter of the [open rotor] is bigger. There are new constraints in terms of integration and certification [as well as] managing vibration, noise, acoustics [and] stability. The [constraints] are more complex, but there are potential solutions as well. There are benefits, and there are topics to be addressed and to be validated.

If you go for open rotor, this would likely mean a single-source engine, right? It’s clear that an open-rotor architecture is very specific compared to a traditional one. And therefore, as of today, we don’t see a plane compatible with both open-rotor and classical architecture. It will be either single-source—which is what we do on the widebodies at Airbus—or what Boeing is doing with CFM on the 737. Or the engine-maker that is less visible today than CFM on open rotor would also go for that architecture if it is selected by one of the OEMs.

If you launched an A220-500, could you still go with a Pratt engine, or would you have to open it up to additional sources given the durability issues Pratt currently has on the geared turbofan? We are very happy with the dual-engine configuration we have on the A320neo. So if we could over time on the A220 have a dual-engine option—especially with a new variant being the -500—that’s one thing we would really like to see. The Pratt engine on the A220 is delivering excellent performance and economics. The engine is reliable, but the engine is not durable. The time on wing is not OK, and Pratt is working hard to solve those problems. The Pratt engine is not the only new-generation engine that has poor durability, but it’s more visible on the Pratt engine than on the others because they have gone so low in terms of [maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO)] and spare capacity during COVID. Now they are missing MRO capacities and spare parts, and it’s impacting the in-service fleet. That’s the main difference.

Does the industry rely too much on SAF plans that may not be realistic? We need to continue to reduce fuel burn to afford the price of e-fuels in the 2030s and 2040s. SAF is significantly more expensive than kerosene and will remain so for the foreseeable future. Today, airlines that are buying SAF in Europe pay 3.5-5 times more. In the U.S., the [Inflation Reduction Act] is significantly changing the equation. SAF will be 30-100% more expensive than kerosene—significantly cheaper than in Europe but still more expensive. The first decade of SAF will be mainly with biofuels, but we will then reach a plateau at around 10-15% of kerosene [demand] because the feedstock will be missing. We are working with partners on how to accelerate the e-fuels and see significant amounts of e-fuels reaching the market at decent prices in the 2030s. Today, e-fuels are expected to be more expensive than biofuels.

Some people have interpreted the fact that you talk about a new narrowbody as an indication that you are slowly walking away from hydrogen. What do you tell them? That is completely wrong. I am absolutely not slowing down or reducing investments in the hydrogen plan. It is exactly the opposite. We are absolutely convinced that hydrogen will have an important role to play starting with short- and midrange aeroplanes. We absolutely want to continue and build the first hydrogen plane in 2035. Hydrogen is the only fuel that we think is appropriate for aviation that can reach that [net-zero] objective, and hydrogen again is one of the products required for e-fuels. It is much cheaper to burn hydrogen directly than this complex fabrication of fuel—with hydrogen and carbon you capture somewhere in the air, then use energy to combine the two in synthetic fuel. Hydrogen, in my view, is absolutely essential for the long-term sustainable aviation that we are calling for. It is absolutely wrong that we are putting more energy in SAF and the next generation of single-aisles to the detriment of hydrogen. Hydrogen is hydrogen. We believe in it. We keep working on it, and we will bring it to the market.

You finally signed the long-awaited agreement on the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) late last year, so how do you see the progress? Yes, it took more time to come to an agreement on the workshare of the FCAS than we were expecting. But with hindsight, significant progress has been achieved since 2017-18 when this all started. Then we had to reshuffle the complete workshare across all seven pillars to accommodate the arrival of Spain. But that’s been very fast. Yes, we were frustrated by the fact that we thought we would sign Phase 1B in early 2022 and we signed at the end of 2022, but that was not wasted time. Work is now progressing very smoothly, and the work with Dassault is of outstanding quality.

Don’t forget, FCAS is not just about the new-generation fighter—there are six other pillars, and they have been less controversial because of the way the workshare was managed. Even on the engine side, it was not a walk in the park—the setup between Safran, MTU and ITP Aero was quite complex when ITP joined—but they were less public in the press about their problems.

Does FCAS need more national partners, or should the program wait for exports? Well, I think both. Yes, it was a hell of a lot of work to build those seven pillars with three partners and a complex industrial setup. Given the nature of the program, we must run Phase 1B with the existing partners. But in the long run, I am absolutely convinced we need more industrial partners—just look at the F-35 with its eight partner countries.

We see governments in Europe declaring major increases in defense spending, yet some are slow to spend that money—in the case of Germany. Or in France, the military programming law looks set to delay several major programs, including Airbus-led projects, and accelerate others. What is your view on what is happening here? We are facing a set of contradictions. There are declarations and intentions for more cooperation in Europe, but we see a lot of national programs being accelerated. That’s one contradiction. The other one is governments spending more money in the short term, but almost nothing has changed—except on ammunition; we have seen lots of ammunition orders and some deliveries. But the big programs have not been significantly impacted. When you look at structural decisions, [governments] look at different areas of the battlefield, like cyber, space defense, nuclear deterrence in France or the aircraft carrier. It’s true that there is more money that will be spent, but not necessarily on the existing programs.

Now we believe it is positive that European countries [have] come to the realization that defense and security matter, but they also need to come to the realization that cooperation is a must to be effective. Short-term, many are making fast decisions that consider national needs. So the short term is not necessarily aligned with the bigger narrative. [For] the European initiatives, cooperation will deliver what they can deliver. FCAS is the lighthouse of European cooperation that needs to prove Europe right.

Are the European defense initiatives—the European Defense Fund (EDF) and Permanent Structured Cooperation—delivering on their goals? What is your view on those? I think those European initiatives are reflecting the right intentions—the sincere will of European countries to create schemes to better cooperate on defense. But I think they suffer from the complexity of Europe and sometimes from the other bureaucratic terms and conditions for using those devices. They need to be improved over time. But that is not going to be easy, and that will take time. We’ve seen a lot of national initiatives linked to Ukraine that have proven to be fast, and that is one of the tensions I see on these initiatives. The [European Defense Industrial Development Program], the EDF and others are quite complex and sometimes bureaucratic and therefore quite slow to use. But we need to learn to improve them to make them more efficient so that they really deliver what was the intention at the beginning.

On helicopters, you made your mark with the H160 development; your Eurocopter predecessor Lutz Bertling had the H175. Will current CEO Bruno Even have his own helicopter program to launch? There has long been consideration for a replacement of the Ecureuil (Squirrel) AStar platform, for example. I think Bruno is putting his mark on Airbus Helicopters. It is a very successful company in terms of economics [and] industrial transformation. They are doing well in terms of technological developments and on the military side. But yes, I hope there will be a product coming out one day where Bruno will have some ownership. We’ve seen the first flight of a demonstrator recently, and I think you’re not wrong in your thinking. This is an area where you should keep monitoring what’s happening.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.987473726272583}",neutral,0.987473726272583,0

Airbus growth project in 'full swing' at Alabama manufacturing center - Made In Alabama,"Mon, 19 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hZGVpbmFsYWJhbWEuY29tLzIwMjMvMDYvYWlyYnVzLWdyb3d0aC1wcm9qZWN0LWluLWZ1bGwtc3dpbmctYXQtYWxhYmFtYS1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLWNlbnRlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“The expansion of our industrial footprint in Alabama is an important part of Airbus’ global single-aisle aircraft production increase,” said Daryl Taylor, Head of Commercial Operations for Airbus in the U.S.

“We look forward to continuing to partner closely with the State of Alabama and our industry partners to solidify our region’s position in the aerospace sector.”

Greg Canfield, Secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce, said Airbus represents a lynchpin in his team’s multi-faceted efforts to secure new industry investment and jobs for the state.

“Aerospace industry growth continues to be a high-value opportunity for Alabama, not only in terms of capital investment but also in job creation,” said Secretary Canfield, who is leading an Alabama business development team at the 2023 Paris Air Show this week.

“There are exceptional developments taking place right now in aerospace and aviation in the state, and we’re seeing that encapsulated with the expansion project taking shape at Airbus’ manufacturing center in Mobile,” he added.

CONSTRUCTION TIMELINE

At Airbus’ U.S. Manufacturing Facility, construction is under way on three new A320 hangar bays, two paint shop bays, a supplemental utility plant and the relocation of an upgraded utility corridor, which provides critical services like power and water to the entire campus.

In coming months, HPM will support procurement for the second A320 FAL along with additional hangar capacity for existing programs at the U.S. Manufacturing Facility and infrastructure improvements.

Preconstruction planning is ongoing for the site’s Welcome Center, a transshipment hangar, a fire station and a Physical Security Operations Center.

In addition, HPM and Airbus are exploring safety and sustainability measures for the Alabama production center that include solar/photovoltaic arrays, HVAC optimization and upgrades, and water use reduction strategies. All new facilities are designed with a LEED Silver minimum baseline.

“The lifecycle of the A320 Single Aisle Ramp Up expansion project in Mobile is in full swing, including new installations, advanced upgrades and implementation of proposed infrastructure,” HPM President Ryan Austin said.

“We look forward to playing a role in the continued progress of this ambitious endeavor and are honored to partner with Airbus.”

HIRING SUPPORT

These growth plans also mean 1,000 new jobs at the Mobile facility, which employed around 1,200 team members at the time of the May 2022 announcement and currently employs over 1,600. The hiring wave builds on an earlier expansion project for an A220 FAL.

AIDT, Alabama’s primary workforce development agency, is deeply involved in helping Airbus fill new positions.

“We are quite busy with the continued ramp-up of both the A320 and A220 projects,” said Ed Castile, Director of AIDT and Deputy Secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce. “There are 150 different jobs we are recruiting for between the two, for both hourly and salaried employees. Many of those jobs have multiple headcounts.

“So, it’s business as usual and full steam ahead based on their hiring timeline,” he added.

Castile said AIDT is expanding its Alabama Aviation Center, a 36,500-square-foot facility at Brookley that opened in 2014 to help Airbus get production up and running. Bids for a contractor are scheduled to go out in August, with a planned completion date for the expansion in fourth quarter 2024.

The Alabama Office of Apprenticeship is also lending a hand, adding 21 new apprentices in three occupations at the Airbus plant. The overall effort is getting assistance from local schools, the Alabama Community College System and universities in the state, as well as the Flight Works Alabama education center.

“It takes the entire village, and we are in it to win it,” Castile said.

MILESTONES

Airbus announced its plans for the Alabama manufacturing facility — its first in the U.S. — in 2012. The plant has given Airbus a strategic foothold in the large North American market at a time when many carriers are replacing aging aircraft with newer, more fuel-efficient models.

HPM provided program management services for development of the original $600 million Airbus A320 FAL, where production was launched in 2015, and the $350 million A220 FAL, which came online in 2020.

Since beginning operations, Airbus’ Mobile facility has delivered over 385 A320 and A220 passenger jets to 13 customers.

In May, the facility celebrated the delivery of its 100th Alabama-built A320 Family aircraft to Delta Air Lines, a milestone occurring seven years after the carrier received its first. Days later, another milestone was reached with the first delivery of an A320neo to a non-U.S.-based airline, Mexico’s Volaris.

When the current expansion was announced last year, Airbus said it was part of the company’s strategic plans to ramp up global production of A320 Family jets.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9003052115440369}",positive,0.9003052115440369,1

Mixed reality to meet future challenges - Airbus,"Wed, 21 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTA2LW1peGVkLXJlYWxpdHktdG8tbWVldC1mdXR1cmUtY2hhbGxlbmdlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Delivering thousands of commercial aircraft, a large number of helicopters and new space and defence solutions over the coming years is a huge challenge for Airbus. To help get there, the company intends to make extensive use of mixed reality. Let’s see what mixed reality is and how it is implemented at Airbus.

What is mixed reality?

Currently under development at Airbus, mixed reality brings together technologies that modify our perception of reality. The most well-known applications are augmented reality, a representation of the real world to which 3D digital information is added; and virtual reality, a totally immersive digital environment. To access both, users need a helmet or special glasses.

What are its main benefits?

Mixed reality helps to improve quality, safety and security. Operators are better at getting things ‘right first time’ and reducing lead times with the right information in front of them, whether via a hard-hat mounted screen or using goggles. In the aerospace industry, improving quality means increasing safety and reducing production time.

What’s Airbus’ background?

Digital developments are nothing new for Airbus. Already back in the early 2000s, our teams had grasped the potential of virtual reality in immersive environments for applications linked to parts design.

Then, over the last five years, Airbus has taken further major steps towards digitisation, transforming operations and services across all platforms. Data continuity and the creation of a common digital environment help us to interact seamlessly, from the creation to operation of our products, between different in-house skills and professions, as well as with our partners and customers in the wider world. The emergence of augmented reality solutions and equipment that give operators and engineers a more advanced, hands-free experience directly in their workplace has only accelerated the pace.

What’s the current situation at Airbus?

Airbus is now working with the best technologies available on the market, and in partnership with the most advanced players in the sector, such as Unity, to develop and implement these technologies in-house. For all Airbus platforms there are more and more use cases and proofs of concept, from design and training to manufacturing and maintenance of our products and associated services.

Mixed reality: collaboration into a new dimension

The 2023 Paris Air Show is an opportunity for Airbus to demonstrate the potential of mixed reality, which brings together virtual reality and augmented reality technologies. Airbus is now taking collaboration into a new dimension by introducing a first-in-the-industry concept based on mixed reality technologies for the Cabin Customisation and Design of the A320 Family.

Immersive Remote Collaboration Concept show more show less Taking collaboration into a new dimension. Airbus is introducing a mixed reality concept for A320 Family cabin customisation and design

“Innovation is in easyJet’s DNA which is why we are always interested to see where technology can play a role in driving efficiency or improving our customer experience. The potential of augmented reality technology is significant and could range from cabin improvements to more efficient engineering troubleshooting. We look forward to working with Airbus to develop this further in the future”, confirmed Shane Lord, Director of Strategy and Fleet at Easyjet

What are our main projects and use cases in the conception phase?

Virtual reality is mainly used in the design phase whereas augmented reality is mainly applied during product assembly. However, that use is widening to Engineering. Initiated by Airbus Helicopters on the Super Puma, and extended for system understanding for customers by the Brisbane team (Airbus Australia Pacific), augmented reality went on to be used for A350 cabin mock-ups in Hamburg. It is also contributing to tooling integration tests at the Mirabel site in Canada.

What are our main projects and use cases as far as production is concerned?

In manufacturing, augmented reality glasses help operators to carry out complex or labour-intensive tasks while keeping their hands free. It helps operators to handle heavy parts while having all the information they need right in front of them.

At Airbus’ Getafe plant, where A330s are converted to MRTTs (Multi Role Tanker Transport), since 2019 mixed reality has been used to complete 70% of work orders, mainly for electrical and hydraulic installations. Building on the benefits for operators, the project is now being extended to the A400M and C295 programmes, with greater integration into the information systems.

Airbus Commercial Aircraft is also seeing a growing number of initiatives. An international project uses Microsoft's Hololens 2 (validated for industrial use at Airbus), whose semi-transparent screen allows operators to see a holographic representation of the task in hand. They can also document their activities directly via the installed software. By virtually pressing a button, the system knows that a work step has been completed.

Airbus has put in place an approach that enables an application to be rapidly adapted and deployed in a different user context. For example, the first application to be industrialised will help with the drilling and fitting of brackets at the Getafe, Saint-Eloi and Broughton sites, while in Hamburg a new adaptation of the application will help with quality control activities.

The number of ideas for use continues to grow. The teams with expertise in augmented reality are working on implementing the visualisation of cable harnesses in a cabin that has already been installed, checking supports, installing maintenance labels on wings or checking that they have been glued in place.

In fact, mixed reality continues to take its place in increasingly varied fields. At Airbus, mixed reality is more than ever a reality.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9768516421318054}",positive,0.9768516421318054,1

These semiconductors will play a significant role in powering future hybrid helicopters, aircraft, the ZEROe roadmap, as well as the CityAirbus NextGen.

Toulouse / Geneva - Airbus, a global pioneer in the aerospace industry, and STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM), a global semiconductor leader serving customers across the spectrum of electronics applications, have signed an agreement to cooperate on power electronics Research & Development to support more efficient and lighter power electronics, essential for future hybrid-powered aircraft and full-electric urban air vehicles.

The collaboration builds on evaluations already conducted by both companies to explore the benefits of wide bandgap semiconductor materials for aircraft electrification. Wide bandgap semiconductors like Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Gallium Nitride (GaN) have superior electrical properties compared with traditional semiconductors like silicon. They enable the development of smaller, lighter and more efficient high-performance electronic devices and systems, particularly in applications requiring high power, high frequency, or high-temperature operations.

The co-operation will focus on developing SiC and GaN devices, packages, and modules adapted for Airbus’ aerospace applications. The companies will assess these components by conducting advanced research and tests on demonstrators, such as e-motor control units, high and low voltage power converters, and wireless power transfer systems.

“This collaboration with STMicroelectronics, a global leader in power semiconductors and wide bandgap technologies, will be key to support Airbus’ electrification roadmap,” said Sabine Klauke, Airbus Chief Technical Officer. “Leveraging their expertise and experience in power electronics for automotive and industrial applications with our own record in aircraft and VTOL electrification will help us accelerate the development of the disruptive technologies required for the ZEROe roadmap and CityAirbus NextGen.”

“STMicroelectronics is the market leader at the cutting edge of the development of innovative power semiconductors with higher-efficiency products and solutions based on advanced materials, such as Silicon Carbide and Gallium Nitride. We already have a strong, transformational presence in mobility and industrial applications, reinforced by a vertically integrated global SiC supply chain, to support our customers globally with electrification and decarbonisation,” said Jerome Roux, President, Sales & Marketing, STMicroelectronics. “Aerospace is a highly demanding market with specific requirements. Cooperating with Airbus, a global leader in this industry, gives us the opportunity to define together new power technologies the industry needs to realise its decarbonisation goals.”

About Airbus hybridisation and electrification roadmap

Decarbonising flight requires a range of disruptive solutions that mix new fuel types and disruptive technologies. One such solution, hybrid-electric propulsion, can improve the energy efficiency of every aircraft class and reduce aircraft CO2 emissions by up to 5%. That figure could be as high as 10% for helicopters, generally lighter than fixed-wing aircraft. Future hybrid and full electric aircraft require megawatts of power to operate. This implies huge improvements in power electronics in terms of integration, performance, efficiency, and component size and weight.

Paris – Airbus UpNext has launched a new demonstrator programme to explore, on the ground and in flight, a new architecture for the generation of non propulsive energy through the use of hydrogen fuel cells.

On conventional airliners, the APU (Auxiliary Power Unit), a small additional engine that runs on traditional jet fuel, provides together with the engines the energy required to power a number of non-propulsive aircraft functions, such as air conditioning, onboard lighting and electric power for avionics. With this new technology demonstrator, led from its facilities in Spain, Airbus UpNext will replace the actual APU of an A330 with a hydrogen fuel cell system that will generate electricity. Known as HyPower, the hydrogen fuel cell demonstrator also aims to reduce the emissions of CO2, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and noise levels associated with a traditional APU.

New design features and integration techniques will also contribute to maturing the safety and operations of future hydrogen-powered aircraft and will demonstrate the stable operation of a fuel cell in-flight, including its restart.

“These tests will mark a new step in our decarbonisation journey and ZEROe programme through an ambitious flight demonstration that will take to the air by end 2025,” said Michael Augello, CEO of Airbus UpNext. “We want to demonstrate the operability and integration of the system, including refuelling the aircraft with hydrogen. We will demonstrate this system in realistic conditions, climbing to 25,000 ft and flying for one hour with 10kg of gaseous hydrogen on board. However, we cannot do this alone and our cooperation with the Spanish Government and external partners will be key enablers of these series of tests.”

The flight test campaign will utilise a modified Airbus A330 and a ground test bed of the system. Airbus UpNext will procure a production unit for renewable hydrogen to fulfil the entire need for the test campaign.

ArianeGroup, an Airbus–Safran joint venture, has successfully tested the concept of a hydrogen conditioning system capable of supplying an aeronautical gas turbine

HyPERION (French acronym for hydrogen for environmentally responsible aviation propulsion ), is a pilot project run by Safran in partnership with Airbus and ArianeGroup, with the support of the French Government’s Investments for the Future Program (PIA), designed to evaluate hydrogen propulsion solutions for commercial aviation

This success brings to a close the HyPERION project launched in December 2020, and represents an important step in the aeronautical technology roadmap for 2035

The project builds on ArianeGroup’s experience in liquid hydrogen developed over decades working on Ariane launcher propulsion

In December 2020, Safran, Airbus, and ArianeGroup came together in a joint research project called HyPERION, with the support of the French Government’s Investments for the Future Program (PIA).

The goal of HyPERION (the project’s name is the French acronym for hydrogen for environmentally responsible aviation propulsion) was to explore safe and efficient technical hydrogen propulsion solutions which could offer an alternative to fossil fuel for commercial aviation by 2035.

HyPERION has enabled significant advances to be made in the definition of hydrogen propulsion systems for commercial aircraft, giving a high degree of security, and in the identification of the various technologies which still need to be developed.

The study covered the entire process from fuel leaving the tanks up to ejection of ignited gases. Distribution circuit definition drew heavily on ArianeGroup’s experience of fuel behavior on the Ariane launchers. Hydrogen is stored as a liquid, then conditioned so that it reaches an optimal temperature and pressure in the engines.

Several test programs were conducted under the HyPERION project: hydrogen combustion tests carried out in close collaboration with the French aerospace lab ONERA, compatibility tests on the metal materials, and tests on a first hydrogen conditioning system (pressure and temperature control).

On May 12, 2023, at its Vernon test facility, ArianeGroup successfully carried out a proof-of-concept test of a hydrogen conditioning system for supplying an aeronautical gas turbine; this first experiment was made possible by reusing equipment (electric pump, gas generator, exchangers) initially designed for space applications. This demonstration is the first step in expanding ArianeGroup’s space technologies to aeronautical applications.

“This successful conclusion to the HyPERION project confirms the potential of hydrogen as an energy source to facilitate decarbonizing civil aviation,” said Martin Sion, CEO of ArianeGroup. “These past few years of close collaboration with our parent companies have enabled us to identify the most promising propulsion system architectures and the technologies to be developed in the coming five years. We are proud of working together to help Europe’s transition towards low-carbon transport by pooling our know-how.”

HyPERION benefited from the unique combination of the proven know-how of Airbus, as an aircraft builder and aircraft fuel systems developer, together with its expertise in the design and manufacture of cryogenic storage systems, of Safran, as an engine manufacturer and designer of engine fuel systems, and of ArianeGroup, the Airbus–Safran joint-venture, the only European industrial company with expertise in liquid hydrogen propulsion technology for the space sector, with the Ariane launcher.

The HyPERION project is receiving support from the French Government via the DGAC (General Directorate for Civil Aviation) and is part of the Investments for the Future Program (PIA). It supplements other initiatives by Airbus, ArianeGroup, and Safran to lower the carbon footprint of air transport.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9995569586753845}",positive,0.9995569586753845,1

Forging ahead with its decarbonisation ambition, Airbus is maturing two hydrogen-based propulsion technologies in parallel. Hydrogen combustion and hydrogen fuel cells are at the heart of ZEROe, our low-carbon emission aircraft concept. H2 fuel cells are also under study as a source of non-propulsive energy. Recent months have seen plenty of achievements, so it’s time to check in for a closer look!

Hydrogen combustion (H2C)

On 12 May this year ArianeGroup, a joint venture between Airbus and Safran, successfully completed a proof-of-concept of a hydrogen ‘conditioning system’ adapted to power an aircraft turbine engine.

Given that hydrogen has to be stored at a bone-numbing -253°C, it needs to be ‘conditioned’ to reach an acceptable temperature and pressure for combustion in the aircraft engine. That’s the system’s job.

The project is known as HyPERION, and was made possible by reusing equipment designed for space applications. It’s an essential building block of the H2C technology roadmap to 2035.

At the same time, Airbus is also actively preparing a future H2C demonstrator with GE and Safran joint venture CFM International. The goal is to mature a flightworthy, fully integrated hydrogen engine and aircraft, using our own A380 test aircraft as a flying test bed.

Hydrogen fuel cells

A few months back Airbus revealed its hydrogen fuel cell engine concept which has been put through its paces at our E-Aircraft Systems test house near Munich. It’s Europe’s largest such facility. Over six months of ground testing, our expert teams have joined forces to achieve the exciting milestone of running the fuel cell at full power: 1.2 megawatts (MW).

This is the most powerful fuel cell test ever achieved in aviation anywhere in the world to date, and a great platform to learn. Airbus is alone in the aviation industry in reaching such a power ‘chain’, coupling 12 fuel cells to reach the output needed for commercial use.

What’s the significance of 1.2 Megawatts?

“In December 2020, Airbus shared with the public a 100% fuel cell powered aircraft concept. This concept was a 100-seat aircraft capable of 1,000 nautical miles and it had six engines. 1.2 megawatts is the power needed by one of these engines at take-off. So we are ground-testing a fully electric propulsion system capable of producing the take off power of a large commercial aircraft.” - Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus VP ZEROe Aircraft.



Even better, the 1.2 MW test was carried out using multiple power channels coupled together on a single propeller, helping Airbus to apply learnings to aircraft design and ultimately, manufacturing. Perhaps even more significantly, the test helps Airbus to further develop its own fuel cell knowledge, in support of certification targets for future hydrogen-powered aircraft.

ZEROe Fuel Cell engine Reveal

The test’s success is a reflection of a true team effort, involving Airbus teams across Europe and heavyweight technical partners such as Liebherr and Aerostack, Airbus’ fuel cell joint venture with ElringKlinger. Finally, it was made possible thanks to the financial support of Airbus’ home nations (LuFo in Germany, DGAC in France and CDTI in Spain) and European initiatives such as Clean Aviation and Clean Hydrogen.

Non propulsive energy

The third project is a demonstrator for non-propulsive energy (NPE), the energy which powers cabin systems and aircraft control surfaces, for example. This power - generally around 5% of the aircraft’s needs - traditionally comes from the kerosene-powered APU, or auxiliary power unit, located in the aircraft tail cone.

AIRBUS UpNext HyPower demonstrator

Airbus subsidiary UpNext’s NPE demonstrator will use a fuel cell containing ten kilograms of gaseous hydrogen generated from renewable sources to produce electrical non-propulsive power. Within three years, the cell will be tested on board an Airbus A330 in standard operating conditions. The NPE project benefits from strong support of the Spanish government and its adoption will help reduce CO2, NOx and noise emissions.

“It takes a team to turn the dream of lower-carbon flight into reality,” says Glenn Llewellyn, VP ZEROe Aircraft at Airbus. “Our hydrogen ecosystem is growing in size and in confidence. We’re on the runway and the flight path is clearer by the day. Reducing aircraft's climate impact is a massive prize at the end of the journey.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8894612789154053}",positive,0.8894612789154053,1

The agreement was signed during the Paris Air Show by Captain Stanley K. Ng, President and Chief Operating Officer of Philippine Airlines, and Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer and Head of International, in the presence of Lucio C Tan III, President & Chief Operating Officer, PAL Holdings Inc.

The A350-1000 has been selected under the Philippine carrier’s Ultra Long Haul Fleet project and will fly on non-stop services from Manila to North America, including to the East Coast of the US and Canada. The new aircraft will join two A350-900s already in service at the airline.

PAL’s A350-1000 fleet will be able to accommodate 380 passengers in a three class layout, with separate cabins for Business Class, Premium Economy and Economy Class.

Captain Stanley K. Ng, President and Chief Operating Officer of Philippine Airlines, said: “This order will see PAL operating one of the youngest and most modern widebody fleets in Asia. We selected the A350-1000 to give PAL the power to match capacity closely to predicted demand on both the very longest routes to the North American East Coast but also on our prime trunk routes to the West Coast and potentially to Europe as well. At the same time the aircraft will use significantly less fuel than older aircraft of a similar size, which also brings an important reduction in carbon emissions.”

Lucio C. Tan III, President & Chief Operating Officer, PAL Holdings Inc. said: “At Philippine Airlines we are committed to offering our passengers the best possible travel experience. These state-of-the-art aircraft will enable us to give them the convenience of nonstop flights on long range routes in a comfortable passenger cabin where our cabin crew can do what they do best – extend gracious service and world-class Filipino hospitality. The A350-1000 is our “Mission Aircraft” to connect the world and boost the Philippine economy and society.”

Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer and Head of International said: “This order is another strong endorsement of the A350 as the world’s long range leader. In terms of non-stop flying capability, efficiency and passenger comfort it is proven to be best in class. It also brings significant reduction in emissions and an immediate contribution to industry sustainability goals. And in the larger widebody category, the A350-1000 has set a standard of its own, with the lowest operating costs and emissions for intercontinental service. We thank Philippine Airlines for its ongoing confidence in Airbus and look forward to working with the airline as the A350 becomes the flagship of its widebody fleet.""

The A350 is the world’s most modern and efficient widebody aircraft and has set new standards for intercontinental travel. It offers the longest range capability of any commercial airliner in production today and is capable of flying 9,700 nautical miles or 18,000 kilometres non-stop.

At the end of May 2023, the A350 Family had won 967 firm orders from 54 customers worldwide, with 535 aircraft currently in the fleets of 40 operators, flying primarily on long haul routes.

Philippine Airlines operates various Airbus types on its full service network. In addition to the A350 on long-haul intercontinental routes, PAL flies A330-300s on services to the Middle East, Australia and various points in Asia. The Philippine flag carrier also operates a fleet of A320 and A321 single aisle aircraft on its extensive domestic and regional network out of hubs in Manila and Cebu.

A320 Family to be the cornerstone of Air India’s domestic and regional fleet

IMS services to optimise Air India fleet operational performance

Skywise: Air India to boost its digital transformation as launch customer for Core X3

Paris - Air India has firmed up its order for 250 Airbus aircraft and selected an Airbus maintenance and digital package to power the airline’s transformation and growth strategy.

The aircraft order includes 140 A320neo and 70 A321neo single-aisle aircraft as well as 34 A350-1000 and six A350-900 wide-body jets. The airline had signed a Letter of Intent to acquire these aircraft in February 2023.

Air India will also be counting on Airbus to help ensure the highest level of fleet availability with the Integrated Materials Solutions (IMS) from Satair, an Airbus company. The Airbus-powered maintenance solution will ensure that every time the airline needs a rotable or a consumable part, it is readily available and stocks are automatically replenished. And in its transformation and digitalisation journey, Air India will be the launch customer for Airbus’ Skywise Core X3, the latest and most advanced aviation analytics platform. This once again demonstrates the avant-garde cooperation between Airbus and Air India.

The purchase agreements for the aircraft as well as the Letters of Intent for maintenance and digital services were signed in the presence of N. Chandrasekaran, Chairman of Tata Sons and Air India, Campbell Wilson, CEO & MD of Air India, Guillaume Faury, Airbus CEO, Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer and Head of International, and Rémi Maillard, President and Managing Director, Airbus India and South Asia at the Paris Air Show 2023.

Campbell Wilson, CEO & MD, Air India, said: “Our ambitious fleet renewal and expansion programme will see Air India operate the most advanced and fuel-efficient aircraft across our route network within five years. We are proud to be working with all our partners, including Airbus, in this journey to rebuild a global airline which reflects India taking a more confident posture around the world.”

""We are excited to be a key partner in the renaissance of the Flying Maharaja. Under the leadership of the Tata Group and a focussed new management, this is one of the most ambitious projects in the airline business today. We are proud that the efficiencies, comfort and range capability offered by our latest generation aircraft will contribute to the process, as Air India reclaims its rightful position as a world-class premium carrier. The Airbus services package is a perfect future-oriented choice that will form a core element of Air India’s transformation,” said Christian Scherer, Chief Commercial Officer and Head of International at Airbus.

The historic Air India order marks the entry into service of the A350 in India, the world’s fastest growing aviation market. The all-new, long-range aircraft will help unlock the pent-up potential of India’s long-haul market, its technology, reach and second-to-none comfort enabling new routes and passenger experience with better economics and enhanced sustainability. Alongside the A350s, the A320 Family fleets will be the efficient, versatile asset to continue democratising and decarbonising air travel in India – from domestic, regional, up to international levels. Deliveries are set to commence with the first A350-900 before the end of 2023.

The A350 is the world’s most modern and efficient wide-body aircraft in the 300-410 seater category. The A350’s clean sheet design includes state-of-the-art technologies and aerodynamics delivering unmatched standards of efficiency and comfort. Its new generation engines and use of lightweight materials delivers a 25 percent advantage in fuel burn, operating costs and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared to previous generation competitor aircraft.

The aircraft offers a 3-class configuration cabin that is the quietest of any twin-aisle and offers passengers and crew the most modern in-flight products for the most comfortable long-range flying experience.

The A321neo is the longest-fuselage member of Airbus’ best-selling, single-aisle A320 Family, comfortably seating 180 to 220 passengers in a typical two-class layout, and as many as 244 in a higher-density arrangement. The A320neo has already set the standards as the world’s most comfortable short-to-medium-haul aircraft that typically accommodates from 140 to 170 passengers, with a maximum capacity of up to 180 travellers. Its environmental performance allows for at least 20 per cent less fuel burn and CO2 emissions as well as 50 per cent noise footprint reduction, compared to previous generation aircraft.

China's first helicopter flight using sustainable aviation fuel - Airbus,"Mon, 12 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0wNi1jaGluYXMtZmlyc3QtaGVsaWNvcHRlci1mbGlnaHQtdXNpbmctc3VzdGFpbmFibGUtYXZpYXRpb24tZnVlbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hefei, 12 June 2023 - An Airbus H125 helicopter belonging to State Grid Space Technology Co., Ltd (SGST) has successfully used sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for a flight demonstration at Hefei Shiwan Airport in China. This is the first helicopter flight using SAF in China, marking an important milestone in the development of low-carbon aviation in Chinese aeronautics. The H125, which is powered by a Safran ARRIEL 2D engine, flew at a hybrid ratio of 40% of SAF provided by CNAF (China National Aviation Fuel).

“The success of this flight is of great significance to stimulate SAF promotion and its application,” said Du Guihe, Board Chairman of SGST. “It makes a positive impact on the enterprises which are proactive on low-carbon general aviation development. It is also a breakthrough for China's general aviation industry to better implement carbon emission reduction in the post-pandemic era.”

“I am proud that our customer, SGST, launched this noteworthy SAF flight with the H125, marking Airbus Helicopters as the first helicopter manufacturer to perform a SAF flight in China,” said Colin James, Managing Director of Airbus Helicopters in China. “In an effort to reduce carbon emissions and set a standard within the industry, we are working with our partners to use locally-produced SAF.”

“The takeoff of SAF-powered helicopters in China once again illustrates the achievements of Safran Helicopter Engines in terms of innovation and SAF application. We have a full engine portfolio certified to operate on up to 50% of SAF. We would like to recall hereby our willingness to play an active role in China by providing propulsion solutions. With our main partners SGST and Airbus Helicopters, we will make further contributions to promote our joint vision of green aviation,” said Marc Delort, General Manager of Safran Helicopter Engines China.

This milestone comes just a few weeks after Airbus and the CNAF signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to intensify Chinese-European cooperation on the production, competitive application and common standards formulation for SAF during the French state visit to China. SAF is an alternative aviation fuel made from feedstock ranging from used fat, oil and grease, to municipal and forestry waste. Compared to fossil jet fuel, SAF has been shown to result in up to 80 percent reduction in CO2 across the entire SAF lifecycle. This cooperation agreement between Airbus and CNAF aims to optimise the SAF supply chain by diversifying the sources and enhancing SAF production towards the ambition of using 10 percent SAF by 2030.

The use of SAF is one of Airbus Helicopters' levers to contribute to ATAG’s Scenario 3 outlook to NetZero in 2050. One of the main benefits of using this new fuel is that it allows the aircraft to minimise its carbon footprint while maintaining the same flight performance.

Today, all Airbus helicopters are capable of flying with a blend of up to 50% of SAF mixed with kerosene, with the aim of having the aircraft operate with 100% SAF by 2030.

China’s answer to Boeing and Airbus isn’t as ‘homegrown’ as it seems. Here’s why - CNN,"Fri, 02 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi8wMi90ZWNoL2NvbWFjLWM5MTktY2hpbmEtYWlyY3JhZnQtaW50bC1obmsvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBSmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjMvMDYvMDIvdGVjaC9jb21hYy1jOTE5LWNoaW5hLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWludGwtaG5r?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hong Kong CNN —

China is claiming a historic win this week after its answer to Boeing and Airbus, the C919, took to the skies for its first commercial flight.

Beijing calls the aircraft its first large homegrown passenger jet. It’s a prominent symbol of Beijing’s broader “Made in China” strategy, a campaign to reduce national reliance on foreign manufacturers.

But instead of boosting China’s global stature in technology innovation, experts say the C919 is a symbol of its continued reliance on the West.

That’s because a large chunk of the plane’s parts come from foreign suppliers, predominantly in North America and Europe. Chinese state media has said about 40% of the model’s components are imported, though experts say the real proportion is much higher.

While it is normal for manufacturers to source equipment for their planes from around the world, “the C919 is unique in that almost nothing that keeps it in the air is from China,” said Scott Kennedy, who spent two years leading a team that researched China’s decades-long efforts to develop its own commercial aircraft.

Their conclusion? “The C919 is primarily a non-Chinese airplane with Chinese paint on it,” said Scott, trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington.

A long-held dream

The C919 was built by the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), a state-owned enterprise based in Shanghai, with the stated goal of letting “China-made large aircraft fly in the blue sky.”

One cannot overstate how difficult that is, according to Shukor Yusof, founder of Endau Analytics, which tracks the aviation industry.

Currently, only a handful of countries in the world make their own planes — and for good reason, he said, citing extremely high obstacles, such as serious technical expertise, rigorous regulatory requirements and eye-popping amounts of time and resources.

The C919, for instance, has already cost an estimated $49 billion, according to CSIS, though it says pinning down precisely how much is an almost impossible task because COMAC’s finances are opaque.

While it’s not COMAC’s first homegrown plane, more attention has been directed to this model because of its size.

The C919 can seat up to 192 passengers and fly up to 5,550 kilometers (about 3,500 miles).

COMAC’s first commercial plane, by comparison, is a much smaller regional jet called the ARJ21, which can only fly up to 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles) and accommodate up to 97 passengers.

COMAC is also working on a long-range, widebody plane called the CR929. But the project, a joint effort by China and Russia, has likely stalled since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, said Kennedy.

“That plane will probably never be more than a photo, never be more than a drawing,” he told CNN. “No one is going to be supplying technology to a Chinese-Russian joint venture.”

Made in China?

The C919’s maiden commercial flight took place Sunday, flying passengers from Shanghai to Beijing for China Eastern Airlines (CEA).

China hopes the C919 will become its alternative to Boeing’s 737 and Airbus’s A320 and cement its status as a high-tech superpower, says Kennedy.

But because the government has touted the aircraft as a homemade success, analysts have been quick to point out just how much is made outside China.

In a 2020 analysis, CSIS estimated that approximately 90% of the C919’s main or large-scale component suppliers were from North America and Europe, with only 10% coming from China and other countries in Asia. Yusof cited a similar estimate.

Kennedy said while it was possible the proportion had changed since the 2020 report, he thought it was unlikely given how tough it would be to change suppliers during the aviation certification process.

The C919 got the green light for commercial service and mass production in mainland China late last year, after years of delays.

China has acknowledged the criticism. “Some people have been questioning whether the C919 can be called a domestically-manufactured aircraft when it relies on imports,” Chinese state-run tabloid Global Times said in an editorial Monday.

“It is true that there is a long list of foreign suppliers for the C919.”

The aircraft contains “Honeywell’s (HON) electricity system and landing gear, GE’s (GE) flight recorder, CFM Leap’s engine, Parker Aerospace’s flight control system and fuel system, Rockwell Collins’ weather radar and simulate system, and Michelin’s (MGDDY) tires,” the outlet noted. All are US or European companies.

The government’s position is that other manufacturers often rely on imports, too.

Boeing and Airbus also depend on “high-quality global suppliers,” state-run newspaper China Daily said in an editorial Wednesday.

America’s Boeing (BA) sources about 40% to 50% of components for planes such as its 787 Dreamliner from outside the United States, according to Yusof. Airbus (EADSF), a European plane maker, also sources from countries such as Malaysia, he said.

Taking on titans

China has made no secret of its ambition for COMAC to eventually compete against Airbus and Boeing, which currently command virtually the entire market.

Yusof said this was unlikely to happen anytime soon.

For one, COMAC hasn’t distinguished its planes enough to convince carriers to make the switch. Its technology is “already available in the Airbus and in the Boeing planes,” he said.

It could also take many years for its planes to be certified by US and European aviation regulators.

But once production ramps up, it’s expected to win more orders at home, or in developing countries where carriers may not be able to afford the current market leaders’ prices. In Indonesia, domestic airline TransNusa became COMAC’s first overseas customer last year.

“It should be greatly appreciated that another country apart from the Europeans and the Americans are providing an alternative aircraft in the commercial market,” said Yusof.

But even if China were to price its planes more aggressively, it will take a long time to win people over, he added.

“Airlines in the world will not be easily persuaded to buy one, because there’s always a stigma [with new players] whether you like it or not,” Yusof said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997633099555969}",neutral,0.9997633099555969,0

Airbus Targets Both Conventional And Hydrogen Platforms For Mid-2030s - Aviation Week,"Wed, 14 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9zaG93bmV3cy9wYXJpcy1haXItc2hvdy9haXJidXMtdGFyZ2V0cy1ib3RoLWNvbnZlbnRpb25hbC1oeWRyb2dlbi1wbGF0Zm9ybXMtbWlkLTIwMzBz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On the surface, the story is pretty simple. Through a combination of clever strategy and the mistakes of rival Boeing, Airbus has achieved a commanding—and enduring—lead in most segments of the commercial airplane market.

Its products are selling so well that its main issue is figuring out how to build and sell more of them faster. The company also has developed a vision for the future and has promised to deliver its first hydrogen-powered aircraft in 2035, the initial sign of the aerospace industry’s transformation toward a sustainable future.

Production and supplier constraints likely to limit growth for years

CEO Faury outlines new conventional narrowbody for the first time

Commitment to hydrogen aircraft remains

It seems to be the ideal scenario for the Euro­pean commercial aircraft manufacturer as the industry heads into its first Paris Air Show since 2019. But while Airbus’ success is undeniable, its future may be more complicated than many expect, particularly internally. Its challenges, some of which are issues for the industry at large, are substantial—and it has more than a few. They include operational questions and strategic issues that likely will keep management busy. High on the agenda and more pressing than is apparent at first: the OEM’s strategy for future products. Intertwined with that concern is an evolving relationship with—and realignment of—the three engine manufacturers. All of that makes for some complicated game theory.

GOOD AND GRIM

But more on that later. Last fall, things looked simultaneously good and grim for Airbus. The COVID-19 downturn was largely behind it. Airlines had just gone through a problematic summer, but that season also had shown demand bouncing back more quickly than anyone had anticipated—a recovery that was not at all clear a few months earlier. Aircraft orders were picking up again, and the ambitious production growth Airbus had outlined to customers and investors quickly gained credibility. If demand was that good, Airbus may have gotten it right, more and more pundits declared.

On the grim side, CEO Guillaume Faury and Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer had to inform more customers that their aircraft were going to be late. As with airport security personnel, aircraft component manufacturers and chip, seat and lavatory specialists could not cope with the fast return of business. Faury told investors last November he believed he had seen the worst.

As it turned out, he was wrong. When the industry moved into 2023, the supply chain problems were far from resolved. In fact, many maintain that the issues are at least temporarily worsening, making it unlikely that Airbus will be able to achieve its production target of 75 A320neo-family aircraft per month, a goal already delayed by one year. Aerospace recovered from previous crises relatively quickly, but not this time. “Why is it that the industry is in so much trouble?” asks one senior executive. “That is the single most strategic question that we have.”

His answer is that COVID-19 has broken the entire system, as a painfully large number of experienced engineers left the industry. For Airbus, the structural disruption of its supply chain—which it had tried to avoid by keeping narrowbody rates at 40 per month even in the worst phase of the pandemic—could have severe consequences. Its underperformance could continue even beyond 2024. Air Lease Corp. Executive Chairman Steven Udvar­-Hazy does not foresee a full recovery until 2028, and CEO John Plueger has made clear that customers are no longer willing to accept the constant delays without compensation.

What worries some observers is that Airbus’ industrial management may be operating at the limit of their abilities. “Apart from Faury, the Airbus management team is just not capable of facing the challenges,” says one particularly critical insider. “They and the industry as a whole have not gotten their arms around them.” In early February, after Airbus delivered a dismal 16 A320neo-family aircraft in January—many fewer than required for it even to approach its production targets—the usually composed Faury is said to have “gone ballistic” in a senior management meeting.

Two months later, he ousted Michael Menking, who had led the A320neo-­family program since just before the pandemic. Menking had been brought in to fix production at the previous peak and associated problems. But can changing one senior executive address endemic structural problems?

Airbus has launched other initiatives as well. It set up Airbus Atlantic in France and Airbus Aerostructures in Germany. Stelia and Premium Aerotec, both former arm’s-length Airbus subsidiaries, were merged with various previous Airbus sites to form stronger aerostructures firms that are more integrated than a supplier would customarily be.

The process is more advanced in France, in part because of earlier restructuring successes in the Stelia days. But union opposition has slowed the German efforts. Even German units considered uncompetitive as part of Airbus because of their high cost structure are not planned to be sold. They must instead be turned around, requiring management attention that could be better used elsewhere—such as in securing production, adding contingency and stock in an attempt to avoid further frustrating customers. But, International Air Transport Association (IATA) Director General Willie Walsh says airlines are already “beyond frustrated.” IATA Chief Economist Marie Owens Thomsen notes that when an aircraft delivery is six months late, “that is now considered on time.”

The latest projections are for the most urgent supply chain constraints to persist until at least 2024 and possibly the end of that year and for aircraft demand to outstrip supply for the foreseeable future.

THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM

The even longer-term question is: Where does Airbus go from here with its product strategy once the industrial situation is under control? Faury surprised the industry in April when he commented twice in the same week—in a radio interview and at a French trade group GIFAS event—that Airbus could bring a new conventional narrowbody, replacing the A320neo family, to market in the second half of the 2030s.

While that comment was in some ways stating the obvious, it opened up room for much speculation and interpretation. “That is a very positive statement,” says Adam Pilarski, senior vice president at consultancy Avitas. “They started out by saying that by 2035, everything will change [with the introduction of a hydrogen aircraft]. They may realize that it will take longer—it could be 2050—and in the meantime, they will have to do something else.”

Sash Tusa, aerospace analyst at Agency Partners, is clear about his view: “The elephant in the room is that everything civil aviation does for sustainability is not good enough.” There are still many questions about whether sustainable aviation fuel is really the solution, he contends. At the same time, as other economic sectors improve in sustainability, “aviation could become the single biggest source of industrial emissions,” he adds. Tusa says he is convinced there is no way around a new aircraft program that could deliver double-­digit efficiency improvements, enough at least to compensate for a few years of aviation growth.

And just as the industry was heading into the Paris Air Show, Faury went further than he ever has publicly to confirm the internal plans, telling Aviation Week, “We need a new generation of planes.” He explained: “We need planes that burn around 20-25% less fuel than what we are using today with the A320neo or A321neo. That is why we are preparing entry into service of a brand-new generation of planes in the second half of the next decade, targeting 2035, maybe between 2035 and 2040.”

Faury’s rationale is simple: Sustainable aviation fuel will continue to be scarce and very expensive, even in the long term, so aircraft that burn much less fuel will need to be available.

The revelation is huge news even for close observers who had so far seen little or no evidence of Airbus working on something. That Airbus is getting serious about a new aircraft “makes me feel much more comfortable with their strategy,” Pilarski says. “I am impressed with them; they are way ahead of Boeing from a strategic point of view.” He attributes this, among other reasons, to Scherer: “[Scherer’s predecessor] John Leahy was a great salesman, not a strategic thinker. Scherer is a strategic thinker.”

Some in the industry speculate that Airbus is “slowly backing away from hydrogen,” Pilarski notes. Faury strongly rejected that notion: “That that is completely wrong,” he told Aviation Week. “I am absolutely not slowing down or reducing investments of the hydrogen plan.”

One official sees a three-stage approach to new derivative aircraft ahead of the launch of a new narrowbody that looks simple but is really complicated when it comes to the details. “An A220-500 is the obvious next step,” he says, referring to a stretched version of the A220-300 that some key Airbus customers such as Air France and Delta Air Lines would like to see sooner rather than later. That should be followed, he says, by the so-called A322, a stretched A321neo with new wings and new-generation engines. While Airbus is at it, it also could produce an A350neo in the not-too-­distant future, the official points out.

Of the three imagined steps, the A322 appears to be the least likely, simply because Airbus is now confirming it plans an all-new aircraft for 2035, has a mountain of orders to deliver for the A321neo and does not foresee large enough technology advances in the short term to justify another multibillion-dollar development program that would soon be eclipsed by a substantially better aircraft.

All three steps, and particularly the first two, would require a change in current thinking about when to act. Conventional wisdom holds that Airbus does not need to move before Boeing does, since it is dominating the market anyway versus the 737 MAX family.

In the new world of sustainability, however, that argument may no longer hold—it does not take into account the considerable pressure on the issue that governments and customers may exert in the coming years. Also, the MAX has been catching up as of late, as Tusa points out. “The MAX is now a serious competitor; it has come back,” he says. “The economics of a 737-8 appear to be good. It worries me that [Airbus] has to make a decision under pressure.”

LIMITING EXPOSURE

Airbus’ product strategy is overshadowed and must be deeply influenced by how it wants to define and alter its future relationship and exposure to the three engine manufacturers. It must face some uncomfortable realities, primarily that it has some dangerously high risks bundled with Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce, both of which are underperforming in their own ways.

As most airlines operating the type can attest, Pratt’s geared turbofan has severe maturity issues, even several years after its initial service entry. On the Airbus side, the A320neo and the A220 are affected. Pratt could need years to recover and bring the engine’s maturity in line with previous-generation powerplants. “The industry is losing confidence in Pratt,” says one industry source. “People are clearly realizing that.” He says customers are doubting the official timeline for the “Advantage” version of the engine, which incorporates many lessons learned from the earlier geared turbofan block standards that have seen so many problems. The more accepted time frame appears to be 2026, versus the announced arrival date of 2024.

“Airbus is overexposed to Pratt,” Tusa says. “[Years ago] Leahy said that you can’t trust Pratt.” With Pratt now part of Raytheon Technologies, the problem has made things worse for Airbus strategically, Tusa points out. “They have very little leverage against Raytheon,” given how many aircraft systems the supersupplier is delivering for Airbus products. “Raytheon has a lot of challenges,” Tusa adds. “And Airbus is not at the top of their list.”

Airbus also is exposed to Rolls-Royce’s issues; the British OEM is the exclusive engine provider for the A350. Rolls’ Trent program is continuing to recover from reliability shortfalls. In addition, the company is in a fragile financial state, and new CEO Tufan Erginbilgic has promised to make few compromises in his efforts to turn it around. Industry sources expect him to try to renegotiate the power-by-the-hour agreements for the Trent XWBs, “and that will upset a lot of customers,” an industry source says.

One observer says he is “very, very concerned” that a much harder-nosed commercial strategy implemented by Rolls-Royce could make the A350 less competitive.” Faury acknowledged the issue: “Obviously, having competitive engine rates is essential for the A330neo and the A350. That’s the tension that Rolls-Royce has to manage. They need to recover their financials but at the same time be competitive and not undermine the ability to win campaigns.”

The launch of new versions of existing aircraft or even a new program could provide Airbus with a golden opportunity to reset its business with engine OEMs for decades to come. The likely beneficiaries: GE Aerospace and its partner in the CFM International consortium, Safran.

On the other side of the Atlantic, GE would love nothing more than to fix its relationship with Airbus. The largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft engines does not have a presence on two of three programs of the biggest commercial aircraft-maker—an undesirable position for the long term. And in the one program in which it does participate, the A320neo family, GE delivers “only” around 60% of the engines, with Pratt having taken the rest.

GE and Airbus have begun working closely together on the questions around the RISE technology program, which is planned to lead to a next-­generation open-rotor engine capable of powering a narrowbody-size aircraft around 2035. It is of course no coincidence that this is the same earliest service-entry time Airbus is targeting for its new narrowbody family. “CFM strongly believes it’s viable,” Faury revealed. “Our teams believe it is likely to be viable, but there are still a number of boxes that need to be ticked.” Faury’s bottom line: “We consider it to be a promising technology.”

It is important to note that RISE as a complete engine product would also require a new airframe, simply because the open rotor would be too large to fit under the wing of any current narrowbody. That is why many also have interpreted its launch as a signal to Boeing to not attempt a new narrowbody for entry into service before 2035 because GE would not have an engine ready.

As a side note, Airbus’ selection of an open rotor would force Pratt & Whitney to offer the same technology to power the next Airbus narrowbody or risk being left out.

However, GE could roll out parts of the broader technology program into earlier applications. The most obvious opportunity could be a powerplant for the A220-500. That would give Airbus an engine likely more efficient than the geared turbofan. At the same time, the launch of another A220 version would decrease its exposure to Pratt. For CFM, an A220-500 might even be the chance for a “mini-RISE”—an engine with a new core and a small open rotor.

Airbus would like to have a second engine OEM for the A220. “If we could, over time on the A220, have dual engine options, especially with a new variant being the -500, that’s one thing we would really like to see,” Faury said. “It has been very successful for the A320neo.”

“An A220-500 with an alternative engine would be a rational decision,” Tusa says. An A220-500 with a Leap or RISE engine would be “the answer,” an industry executive says. “GE would love to put a [version of] the RISE on an A220-500.”

Airbus’ Scherer has repeatedly said that the A220-500 is “not a question of if, but when.” The “when” relates to several issues. Among them is when Airbus will be prepared to cannibalize the A320neo, as the A220-500 likely will be the same size. Engine availability is another question. A quick launch at the Paris Air Show, predicted by some, therefore appears highly unlikely. A more realistic time frame would be a launch around the end of 2024 or in early 2025, with a first major stream of new orders coming in at Le Bourget in 2025.

As for the A350, Rolls-Royce appears to have exclusivity on the -900 but not the -1000. “The A350 is starting to lag a little bit,” says one industry executive, mindful of recent large deals scored by Boeing with its 787 at Riyadh Air and United Airlines. Boeing also got a significant share of the recent Air India order (AW&ST May 22-­June 4, p. 60) and is in a good position for a big commitment by Turkish Airlines expected in the coming weeks (AW&ST May 22-­­June 4, p. 54). For the time being, Faury maintains that the A350 has “the best engine in the industry” and does not need to be upgraded soon. Eventually, it will.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9892768859863281}",negative,0.9892768859863281,-1

However, the U.S. and European plane makers increasingly disagree over just how big the demand for new airplanes will be.

With its Global Market Forecast, Airbus said it expects China to need 9,440 new aircraft between now and 2042, 23% of its total expectation. That marked a major increase of 12% over its expectation a year ago, after it shifted key assumptions around the retirement demand and an increasing aversion to keeping secondhand aircraft inside the country.

Boeing, on the other hand, sees the market to be notably smaller than does Airbus. The U.S. airframer, which formally unveiled its own annual Current Market Outlook on June 18, anticipates China needing 8,560 regional, single-aisle, widebody and freighter aircraft over the same 20-year period.

The dynamics in 2023 represent significantly different trajectories. Airbus is expanding its industrial footprint inside China, while Boeing is trying to thread the geopolitical needle of deteriorating U.S.-China relations.

The China numbers are enormous (despite some serious strategic doubt about their validity) and amount to 20% of the total 42,595 aircraft Boeing expects the world to need. Airbus, notably, doesn’t forecast regional aircraft demand and the plane makers are within 65 aircraft of one another globally when subtracting regionals. Yet the difference between Boeing and Airbus estimates (1,230 aircraft) on China effectively represents the size of the entire need across all of Africa over the next two decades.

Darren Hulst, Boeing vice president for commercial marketing, said that while the company’s figure was slightly higher than last year’s 20-year estimate, “we didn’t see a dynamic that would dramatically change our outlook from last year to this year, you know, the fundamentals that have driven China haven’t changed in terms of economic activity, in terms of growth.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9971240162849426}",neutral,0.9971240162849426,0

Biggest plane deal in history: Airbus clinches massive order from India’s IndiGo - CNN,"Mon, 19 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi8xOS9idXNpbmVzcy9haXJidXMtaW5kaWdvLXBsYW5lLWRlYWwtYmlnZ2VzdC1oaXN0b3J5L2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"London CNN —

Airbus has just landed the biggest-ever aircraft order in the history of commercial aviation.

The French aerospace giant announced Monday that budget Indian airline IndiGo had placed an order for 500 of its A320 planes, to be delivered between 2030 and 2035.

The deal sets “the record for the biggest single purchase agreement in the history of commercial aviation,” Airbus (EADSY) said in a statement, and brings the total number of Airbus (EADSY) planes IndiGo has ordered to 1,330.

Founded in 2006, IndiGo is India’s top airline by market share, according to its website. It flew 86 million customers in the last financial year.

Aviation companies are eager to capitalize on India’s strong economy and its booming population, which may well translate into higher demand for air travel further down the line. In February, IndiGo’s rival Air India ordered more than 470 jets from Airbus and Boeing (BA).

Tech companies have also got the memo, with some expanding production and opening new stores in the country in anticipation of huge growth in their pool of customers.

The International Monetary Fund expects the South Asian nation to outperform all major emerging and advanced economies this year, logging 5.9% growth in gross domestic product. The United Nations also estimated in April that India was on track to overtake China to become the world’s most populous nation by the middle of the year, with 1.43 billion people.

Pieter Elbers, IndiGo’s chief executive, said in a statement that Monday’s order would help the company “fulfill its mission to continue to boost economic growth, social cohesion and mobility in India.” Three quarters of IndiGo’s flights travel to domestic destinations.

In India, Elbers added, “an expanding economy and rising disposable incomes continue to add millions of first-time flyers to a booming aviation market.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.999937891960144}",positive,0.999937891960144,1

IndiGo, India’s dominant carrier, is buying the narrow-body A320 aircraft in what the companies said was the single biggest purchase agreement in commercial aviation history.

Executives from both companies announced the deal on the opening day of the Paris Air Show, the world’s largest event focusing on aviation and space industry. They didn’t disclose how much the order was worth, but it would likely amount to tens of billions of dollars.

The order is “an enormous milestone,” IndiGo CEO Peter Elbers said at a press conference. “No one has ever ordered an order of this magnitude. And it speaks to the potential of Indian aviation and the ambitions which IndiGo is having.”

The purchase highlights how the two companies are “democratizing affordable air travel for millions of people in the world’s fastest growing aviation market,” Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer said in a statement.

New Delhi-based IndiGo’s order surpasses another mammoth deal signed months earlier by Air India for 470 aircraft from both Airbus and U.S.-based rival Boeing.

Indian airlines are racing to tap surging demand for travel from the nation’s growing ranks of middle-class consumers. The A320 jets that IndiGo is buying are typically used on short-haul routes.

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said IndiGo’s order “is a sign of the “incredible growth for aviation” and an “opportunity for Indian people to fly for the first time.

The planemaker also notched up orders from Flynas, a budget Saudi Arabian carrier that is buying 30 A320neo jets, and Air Mauritius, which is buying three wide-body A350 aircraft for use on long-haul routes to Europe and South Asia.

Airbus likes to unveil major jet orders at the air show held every other year in its home country. Airbus is one of France’s — and Europe’s — biggest companies, and its performance at the Paris air show is seen as important to its public image in France.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.998845100402832}",neutral,0.998845100402832,0

EcoPulse demonstrator takes shape ahead of Paris Airshow - Airbus,"Fri, 09 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTA2LWVjb3B1bHNlLWRlbW9uc3RyYXRvci10YWtlcy1zaGFwZS1haGVhZC1vZi1wYXJpcy1haXJzaG930gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"EcoPulse is a Distributed Hybrid-Electric Propulsion aircraft demonstrator jointly developed by Airbus, Daher and Safran. Based on Daher’s TBM light-aircraft platform, this project kick-started in 2019 with an announcement at Le Bourget, supported by CORAC* (the French Civil Aviation Research Council) and co-funded by the French Government* and the EU*.

The objective is to advance technology “techno-bricks” which could contribute to the decarbonisation efforts of the aviation industry. In particular, the demonstrator will evaluate the advantages of distributed propulsion, onboard overall energy efficiency (fuel reduction) and high-voltage electrical propulsion and battery in terms of their potential for integration on future aircraft.

In our previous article last year on the EcoPulse demonstrator we learnt about the development of the high voltage battery to be ready for integration in this test aircraft. Since then, the project’s collaborative teams at Daher, Safran and Airbus have been busy preparing the aircraft’s final aerodynamic and systems configuration – in particular relating to the six distinctive electric propellers (or e-Propellers) mounted on the wing’s leading edge as well as the novel on-board electrical distribution, propulsion and flight control systems. These latest steps further pave the way for the demonstrator’s first appearance in public at the Paris Air Show and subsequent flight powered by electricity only, later this year.



Current status: preliminary aerodynamic testing

Since the start of this year Daher, the TBM aircraft’s manufacturer, has conducted test flights at its development base in Tarbes, France, with the e-Propellers (unpowered at this stage) supplied by Safran. These took place progressively, starting with two, then four, then with all six e-Propellers attached. Each of these units features a three-bladed propeller supplied by DUC Propellers attached to an innovative 50 kW “ENGINeUS” electric motor housed in a pod immediately behind.

This preliminary flight testing has allowed the test pilots to fly the demonstrator aircraft, powered by the legacy turboprop engine in the nose, to focus their attention initially on the aerodynamics, the added inertia and other effects of the pods and their propellers on the platform’s overall resulting handling characteristics. This phase thus brings the project an important step closer to a distributed hybrid electric flight later this year, which will use the six activated wing-mounted e-Propellers.





Subsequent goal: Demonstrating “Distributed Electric Propulsion” in flight

Once the demonstrator does fly with electric mode activated later this year, it will mark the point when the project’s ‘raison-d'être’ – Distributed-Electric-Propulsion (DEP) – will really come to life for the first time. In essence DEP means that a single independent electrical power source, or a mix of them, can provide power for several engines distributed throughout the aircraft.

In the case of EcoPulse, the new integrated high-voltage (around 800VDC) battery, supplied by Airbus jointly provides power for all six SmartMotors with the compact onboard 100 kW turbogenerator provided by Safran, which contains a compact gas turbine coupled to an electrical generator. Airbus’ challenge for developing the battery was to make it lightweight, compact, with very high power and energy density, as well as being compliant with environmental regulations (EU’s REACH etc.) and safe in operation.

At the heart of the DEP architecture is a Power Distribution and Rectifier Unit (PDRU) which is responsible for protecting the high-voltage network and for distributing the available electrical power, as well as high-voltage power harnesses, both developed by Safran.

DEP also allows for differential control of the thrust. In other words the SmartMotors will be controlled individually by the Flight Control Computer (FCC), developed by Airbus, to perform lateral control (thus reducing reliance on a large physical tail rudder and/or ailerons, potentially reducing weight and drag), as well as speed control tasks.

Meanwhile, Daher has provided some cockpit modifications which allow the pilot to simply engage the various DEP modes (such as torque control or speed control) via a special new panel and then fly the aircraft using throttle for power (comprising simply left and right throttle levers – one for each wing); and a sidestick to control the aircraft’s overall direction and trajectory.

The big advantage for pilots is that they will not have to think about what each e-Propeller and/or flight control surface is doing in real-time – either in isolation or in combination – since that aspect is all taken care of by the FCC logic. They simply have to tell the aircraft what they want it to do – via the flight controls.

Another useful feature is that unlike traditional gas turbine aero-engines (eg. turboprops), the angular displacement of each e-Propeller’s rotor can be precisely monitored and governed digitally (down to one single degree!). This allows each propeller to be automatically synchro-phased relative to the adjacent ones to minimise noise and vibration during flight. This aspect, which is another key technological ‘brick’, will be explored in the forthcoming flight test campaign with the DEP activated. Overall, EcoPulse is an excellent opportunity for the partners to evaluate and determine the characteristics expected for future hybrid-powered aircraft projects.

"Leonardo up-guns its M-346 fighter, teams with Airbus on trainer sales - Defense News","Thu, 22 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9nbG9iYWwvZXVyb3BlLzIwMjMvMDYvMjIvbGVvbmFyZG8tdG8tdXAtZ3VuLWl0cy1tLTM0Ni10cmFpbmVyLWpldC10ZWFtLXdpdGgtYWlyYnVzLWZvci1zYWxlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ROME — Leonardo will mount a 20-millimeter Nexter gun on the fighter version of its M-346 jet, the Italian firm said on Thursday, a day after announcing a tie-up with Airbus to market its trainer version of the aircraft.

Leonardo and Nexter will integrate the French firm’s 20M621 gun pod on the M-346FA light fighter to offer greater range and precision than the 12.7mm gun supplied by Belgium’s FN Herstal, which is already offered with the aircraft.

An ITAR-free product, the Nexter gun recovers all casings after firing, the maker said, referring to the U.S. regime of arms export rules that places restrictions on sales of weapons with American components.

The M-346FA, which has reportedly been sold to Turkmenistan, can integrate air-to-air and air-to-surface munitions and targeting pods linked to Helmet Mounted Displays.

The fighter is a variant on Leonardo’s M-346 jet trainer, which has been sold to customers including Italy, Israel, Poland, Singapore and Qatar, racking up 100,000 flight hours.

On Wednesday, Leonardo and Airbus announced a memorandum of understanding which could open the way to the aircraft being more widely adopted in Europe.

In a statement, the firms said they would “jointly address and pursue business opportunities for the provision of advanced training systems leveraging on the M-346′s proven experience.”

They added, “Airbus and Leonardo will also explore deepening ties and industrial cooperation to tackle future military pilot training domains. All based on cooperation and synergies on specific platforms and programs, also in the framework of a broader European and international collaboration.”

Airbus has been planning to build its own trainer for over 20 years, dating back its mulled Mako project when the firm was known as EADS.

But the firm has never taken a project further than the drawing board, and its tie-up with Leonardo appears to suggest it could be open to supplying the M-346 to its home markets in Europe.

As countries like Spain and Germany continue to rely on aging trainer aircraft, the need for high-tech training is growing as countries order more sophisticated jets like the F-35.

In their statement, Leonardo and Airbus predicted the European “advanced trainer” market would amount to more than 400 new aircraft in the next 20 years, plus an additional €12 billion ($13 billion) for training services.

“Leonardo is globally recognized as a key player in the military pilot training business segment and we believe our synergies could give the right answer to our customer requirements,” said Brice Dumont, Head of Military Air Systems at Airbus.

German pilots have already been sent to train at Italy’s flight training school in Sardinia which uses the M-346 and may be proving an efficient promotional tool for the aircraft as pilots from around the world are sent to the base.

Qatar’s M-346 purchase, revealed last year, is part of a wider jet training deal between Italy and Qatar launched in November 2020 which has brought Qatari Phase 4 training pilots to Sardinia to train.

Airbus Leading Consortium To Study Future Medium Airlifter - Aviation Week,"Tue, 27 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9kZWZlbnNlLXNwYWNlL2FpcmNyYWZ0LXByb3B1bHNpb24vYWlyYnVzLWxlYWRpbmctY29uc29ydGl1bS1zdHVkeS1mdXR1cmUtbWVkaXVtLWFpcmxpZnRlctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is to lead a consortium of 33 companies from 12 European countries to study the potential development of a future European airlifter.

Airbus will be the co-ordinator for the Future Air System for European Tactical Transportation (Fasett) project, which is being supported with €30 million ($33 million) from the European Defense Fund (EDF) in its latest round of grants to support European industry defense research and technology development. Fasett is one of 41 European defense projects awarded grants worth a combined €832 million.

The Fasett project will “analyze the technical and market possibilities for the potential development of a new cost competitive and robust” European airlifter, the EDF’s documentation on the project states.

Fasett builds on the back of the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) project known as Future Mid-Size Tactical Cargo (FMTC). Led by France and supported by Germany, Spain and Sweden, FMTC calls for a new airlifter that could replace platforms like the Lockheed C-130, the Airbus C-295 and the Leonardo C-27J, while operating alongside the A400M.

The award of the funding from the European Commission follows statements made by Airbus Defense and Space CEO Michael Schoellhorn to Aerospace DAILY in the lead up to the Paris Air Show. Schoellhorn said industry was examining options for potential replacements of Europe’s Lockheed C-130 Hercules fleets.

“Many of these aircraft are coming toward the end of their lifespan and there is a question of what the 20-ton-class of transport aircraft looks like in the next decade or so,” Schoellhorn said.

Key aims of the Fasett study will be to find a configuration with the payload and volume capacity to accommodate new-generation vehicles used by European militaries, as many have introduced systems that do not fit on platforms such as the C-130.

A potential new platform could become a serious competitor to Embraer’s KC-390 airlifter if Europe is able to accelerate development. The KC-390 already has secured several European orders and is on target to grab more customers in the coming years.

“The Fasett feasibility study aims to carry out a cooperative analysis of the transport aircraft replacement needs of EU Member States on the 2030-40 horizon and to identify European development opportunities to address strategic gaps,” the documents state.

The companies supporting the effort alongside Airbus and its various businesses include Leonardo Aircraft, which builds the C-27J Spartan turboprop airlifter; engine manufacturers Avio Aero, ITP Aero, MTU, Rolls-Royce and Safran; and defense electronics suppliers Hensoldt, Indra and Thales. Some industry officials have described the effort as like that which developed the Transall airlifter in the 1960s. Indeed, the Fasett/FMTC effort will be looking to replace platforms of that size.

EDF funding also will support the next step in the Responsive Electronic Attack for Cooperation Tasks (REACT) project, to the tune of €40 million. REACT has been undertaking research efforts into the potential development of a European escort jamming and electronic-attack capability. Under the second stage of the project, known as REACT II—led by Spain’s Indra—industry will further the development of the system to perform stand-off and stand-in jamming, electronic warfare, command and control, and cyber and electromagnetic activities.

The EDF also will support the second iteration of Odins Eye. This project aims to develop a space-based early warning system to deal with ballistic, hypersonic and even anti-satellite (ASAT) threats.

Odins Eye II is a component of the PESCO Twister—short for Timely Warning and Interception with Space-based TheatER—project aimed at developing a European hypersonic defense system.

The Odins Eye efforts are being led by German satellite company OHB with support from companies including Airbus, Ariane Group, Hensoldt, Leonardo, MBDA, Terma and Thales Alenia Space.

Funding also is supporting early studies into the creation of a next-generation quiet hypersonic wind tunnel, codenamed Silent. Led by France’s Onera research agency, Silent is being supported by €4 million of EDF funding.

The EDF also is supporting research into swarming drone and the protection of uncrewed aircraft systems from rain and icing.

“The EDF is a strong contribution to Europe’s freedom of action, technological leadership and more integrated European defense industrial basis,” says Thierry Breton, the European Commission’s commissioner for the internal market. “The projects undertaken this year demonstrate that European member states, through effective cooperation, are building a stronger European defense.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999815225601196}",neutral,0.9999815225601196,0

Mobile County Commission approves Airbus expansion incentive package - NBC 15 WPMI,"Mon, 12 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbXluYmMxNS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9tb2JpbGUtY291bnR5LWNvbW1pc3Npb24tYXBwcm92ZXMtYWlyYnVzLWV4cGFuc2lvbi1pbmNlbnRpdmUtcGFja2FnZdIBZ2h0dHBzOi8vbXluYmMxNS5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvbW9iaWxlLWNvdW50eS1jb21taXNzaW9uLWFwcHJvdmVzLWFpcmJ1cy1leHBhbnNpb24taW5jZW50aXZlLXBhY2thZ2U?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Mobile County Commission approved an Airbus expansion project incentive package of $10 million at its regular meeting on June 12. This investment is expected to yield 1,000 new jobs for local residents over the next 10 years, boost Airbus’ capital infrastructure outlay to roughly $1 billion at the Brookley Aeroplex, and solidify Mobile’s position as the fourth-largest commercial aerospace manufacturing site in the world.



Per the agreement, the Mobile County Commission will appropriate $1 million each year for 10 years to Airbus. The City of Mobile approved a similar agreement on May 30, 2023.

The agreement between Mobile County Commission, the City of Mobile, and Airbus stipulates that the Minimum Average Hourly Wage for these new jobs is $31.25 per hour. At that rate, the base pay for each one of these 1,000 new positions is approximately $15,000 more per year than the Census-indicated 2021 median household income for Mobile County ($51,169). Further, the agreement was designed to benefit Mobile County residents, requires Mobile Chamber’s Mobile First Initiative reporting, and specifies:

Airbus must invest $2.5 million of Mobile County’s incentive package toward apprenticeship, and/or training programs to benefit local students, newly graduated students, and adults with little to no formal skills or training.

Airbus must pay back the Mobile County cash incentives if it does not meet its hiring target thresholds at specified intervals, with a total employee count of more than 2,100 by the end of 2029.

This expansion to create a second A320 assembly line creates Airbus’ third assembly line at Brookley Aeroplex. Airbus currently employs about 1,100 people and has produced more than 350 aircraft in Mobile since its first final assembly line became operational in 2015 and its first plane was delivered in 2016.

Commission President Connie Hudson, who represents District 2 said: “The growth of Airbus at Brookley Aeroplex in Mobile has had a ripple effect throughout our local economy, not only contributing to the region's manufacturing sector but also stimulating other sectors such as logistics, hospitality, retail, and professional services. The increased economic activity generates tax revenue for the county, supports small businesses, and fosters the prosperity of Mobile County, the region, and our state. With a strong backlog of aircraft orders, growing demand for Airbus’ aircraft, and increasing production rates, the Mobile County Commission looks forward to many years of local benefits from the A320 assembly line expansion this incentive package supports.”

Airbus has engaged in innovative and dynamic workforce development strategies since its 2013 groundbreaking in Mobile. For example, to meet its workforce demands, Airbus has partnered with Bishop State Community College and local high schools on Aviation Manufacturing Technology pre-apprenticeship programs like Flight Path 9. The Mobile County Commission supported these programs through infrastructure investment at Bishop State. Local colleges and universities have increased their aerospace-related degree options as well.

“This incentive package is solidly focused on improving circumstances for all types of workers: young people seeking careers in this sector and adults who need access to skills training and other preparation programs to enable them to acquire high-paying permanent positions,” said District 1 Commissioner Merceria Ludgood. “Overall, the presence of Airbus and its suppliers has been a major contributor to the economic development of Mobile County. A vibrant ecosystem of businesses, workers, services, and workforce development now supports a thriving aerospace industry right here at home,” she added.

Commissioner Randall Dueitt said: “It’s extremely important to me that this incentive package benefit the people of Mobile County through jobs and job training. By obligating Airbus to essentially double its local workforce by 2030 and to continue to invest in training for local residents, Mobile County Commission expects significant economic development impacts in the lives of individuals and families as more high-quality local job opportunities become available for our residents. Airbus has strengthened our local economy, attracted more business and investment to our region, and has done a good job developing pre-employment training programs. Mobile County Commission has played a role in this exciting growth and looks forward to continuing to support initiatives that benefit our community, residents, and local businesses.""

Mobile is one of only five cities worldwide where Airbus assembles its commercial aircraft. Globally, Airbus sells its aircraft to a wide range of customers worldwide, including airlines, leasing companies, corporate jet operators, and government organizations. Planes produced in Mobile are primarily for Airbus customers in the Americas. Airbus recently celebrated the delivery of Delta Airlines’ 100th plane assembled in Mobile. Once fully operational, the new A320 final assembly line in Mobile will help Airbus meet its global goal of 75 planes per month.

Since Airbus committed to assembling aircraft in Mobile over a decade ago, 22 Airbus suppliers have relocated to Mobile County, according to the Mobile Chamber.

An Indigo Airlines Airbus A320 aircraft prepares to land at Ahmedabad Airport on December 27, 2010.

The multibillion-dollar deal eclipses Air India’s combined purchase of 470 jets earlier this year as India’s two largest carriers plan for a sharp expansion in regional travel demand.

IndiGo’s order for A320neo-family jets follows months of negotiations first reported by Reuters. Industry sources said in advance of the Le Bourget event that a 500-plane deal was close.

“This is just the beginning, there’s more going forward. With the growth of India (and) the growth of the Indian aviation market ... this is the right time for us to place this order,” IndiGo Chief Executive Pieter Elbers told a news conference.

The aircraft will be delivered between 2030 and 2035.

Efforts by Indian carriers to keep pace with the world’s fastest-growing aviation market, serving the largest population, have sent industry records tumbling even though manufacturers are struggling to meet output goals.

Indian carriers now have the second-largest order book, with an over 6% share of the industry backlog, behind only the United States, according to a June 1 report by Barclays.

But some analysts have expressed concern that airlines could be over-ordering jets in pursuit of the same passengers.

After signing the IndiGo deal, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said it was premature to start thinking about narrowbody jet production rates higher than the planned 75 per month.

Airbus has faced problems in rebuilding production after the pandemic and has pushed back the mid-decade target to 2026, but Faury said supply disruption was a relatively short-term issue compared with the delivery schedules starting next decade.

Airbus has said it is considering developing a successor to the A320neo between 2035 and 2040, meaning IndiGo is likely to have negotiated the option to switch to any new model or cancel late deliveries rather than be leapfrogged, analysts said.

IndiGo, which accounts for nearly 60% of the Indian domestic market, is keeping Airbus as its supplier of single-aisle jets to squeeze out further economies of scale. But it has not yet decided which engine supplier to use for the latest order.

It switched supplier from Pratt & Whitney to GE-Safran venture CFM International about four years ago following issues with engines’ durability.

IndiGo still has almost 480 jets left in the Airbus pipeline from previous orders. Elbers said the latest order would allow the airline to double in size.

IndiGo continues to hold separate talks with Airbus and rival Boeing for 25 widebody planes, which could either be Airbus A330neos or Boeing 787 jets, sources have said.

Elbers declined to comment on any further plane orders.

Julian is part of a team of University of Zurich scientists led by Oliver Ullrich and Airbus Innovation specialists that could revolutionise medicine on Earth within the next decade - by growing human tissue in space.

Julian, where did the idea come from?

It all started when a group of scientists of the University of Zurich and Airbus Innovation specialists put their heads together in 2018. We wanted to show that producing large amounts of human tissue in space with less complexity is feasible. While the University of Zurich is responsible for the biological concept, Airbus takes care of the space operations.

So, does it work?

We made it happen twice already, both times onboard the International Space Station (ISS). Initially in March 2020, when we developed organ-like liver, bone and cartilage structures from human adult stem cells. Then once again last November. We used tissue stem cells from three women and two men of different ages to test our method’s robustness when using cells of different biological variability. This proved easier and more reliable in microgravity than when grown on Earth due to the effects of gravity. Now, we want to bring the technology to operational maturity.

How will it improve the quality of life on Earth?

Space grown 3D organoids - cells mimicking organ functionality - have the potential to revolutionise medicine on Earth. They could be used as building blocks to replace the tissue of damaged organs without the need for operations - and help save many lives of people that have been waiting in vain for one of the limited donor organs. But that’s not all…

What else?

Pharmaceutical companies could also do toxicological studies directly on human tissue. Animal testing could then be drastically reduced in the future. Prescription drug development would also be less expensive, allowing Pharma companies to do drug research for very rare diseases affecting just a handful of people in the world. All this could improve personal medication and regenerative therapies.

That almost sounds too good to be true. When do you expect all this to become a reality?

It’s happening right now. Pharma companies could use our Organoids already to try to lower their drug development costs. Tailor-made patient treatments based on 3D organoids should be possible in the next 5 years, regenerative medicine and the curing of damaged organs, could happen within the 8-10 years.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.993323028087616}",neutral,0.993323028087616,0

These aircraft bring Volaris total backlog to 143 A320neo Family aircraft, which will support the airline’s continuous fleet renewal and expansion, powered by Pratt & Whitney engines.

“These A321neos will support our long-term business viability and sustainability strategy, while moving us closer to operating an all-NEO fleet by 2028. Our 143 aircraft backlog demonstrates Volaris financial strength and will guarantee our growth in the Mexican market as well as in routes to the United States and Central America,"" said Enrique Beltranena, Volaris President and Chief Executive Officer.

“The A321neo’s superior performance and efficiency will continue to drive Volaris’ network growth. As the fleet grows the airline will be well positioned to meet future demand, especially in the Mexican leisure market. We look forward to working closely with Volaris as it continues to spread its wings,"" said Christian Scherer, Chief Commercial Officer and Head of Airbus International.

The A321neo is the largest-fuselage member of Airbus’ best-selling single-aisle A320 Family. The A321neo allows operators to cover the entire market, while offering the lowest seat-mile cost of any single-aisle available.

Volaris became an Airbus customer in 2006, and since then the airline has ordered 206 A320 Family aircraft, including more than 170 A320neo Family aircraft. Volaris is the largest A320neo Family operator in Latin America.

Airbus has sold over 1,150 aircraft in Latin America and the Caribbean. More than 750 are in operation throughout the region, with another 500 in the order backlog, representing a market share of nearly 60% of in-service passenger aircraft. Since 1994, Airbus has secured 75% of net orders in the region.

"Boeing, Airbus ink massive aircraft deals with Indian airlines - The Washington Post - The Washington Post","Tue, 20 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIzLzA2LzIwL2JvZWluZy1haXJidXMtaW5kaWEtYWlyLWluZGlnby_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The world’s two largest jet manufacturers have announced record-setting deals driven by surging demand from regional airlines in India, signaling a possible resurgence for a commercial aviation industry battered by a years-long covid-induced malaise. In a Tuesday announcement at the Paris Air Show in Le Bourget, France, Boeing said it has finalized an order for up to 220 commercial jets for the fast-growing Air India, with options for another 70 planes. The same airline firmed up an earlier deal for 250 jets from Airbus, Boeing’s European rival.

Just a day earlier the Indian budget airline IndiGo placed a firm order for 500 Airbus A320 passenger jets. At least on paper, it’s the largest deal in the history of commercial aviation.

Air India CEO Campbell Wilson said the massive order will allow Air India to “operate the most advanced and fuel-efficient aircraft” within five years and would bolster India’s position on the global stage. The deals were first announced by Air India in February but made official this week.

“We are proud to be working with all our partners, including Airbus, in this journey to rebuild a global airline which reflects India taking a more confident posture around the world,” Wilson said.

Airbus chief commercial officer called Air India’s expansion “one of the most ambitious projects in the airline business today.” Boeing CEO Stan Deal said the deal “shows [Air India’s] confidence in our products and services in the world’s fastest growing aviation market.”

The most attractive jets on the market currently belong to Airbus, according to Mike Boyd, a commercial aerospace analyst at Boyd Group International. But the jet manufacturer is at “a production chokehold,” backlogged with orders that leave it unable to meet Air India’s full demand.

“Seeing that Airbus couldn’t meet that demand, they called up their friends in Seattle. Boeing is clearly in the descendency, even with this deal,” Boyd said.

The Indian government plans to open 100 new airports in the country by 2024, which could double its air fleet from 600 to 1,200 planes, according to Nirmala Sitharaman, India’s finance minister. The new airports are part of the country’s plan to revamp its transport infrastructure, making air travel between a new network of regional airports cheap and accessible.

Air India’s deal with Boeing is for 190 737 MAXs, 20 787 Dreamliners and 10 777X jets, with the option to purchase an additional 50 737 MAXs and 20 787 Dreamliners, according to a company statement. The airline’s order with Airbus is for 210 A320neo and A321neo narrow-body jets and 40 A350 widebodies.

At list prices, Air India’s deals with Boeing and Airbus are valued at a combined $70 billion, Air India’s Wilson said in February. But deals of this nature are typically discounted from list prices by about 25 percent, Boyd said, with the order specifics subject to change based on advancements in technology and regulation.

The first jets from Airbus’s deal with Air India will be the wide-body A350s and will be delivered by the end of the year, company spokesperson Stefan Schaffrath told The Washington Post. Airbus’s deal with IndiGo has a delivery window that starts in “the early 2030s,” Schaffrath said. Boeing declined to disclose the delivery window for its deal.

Airbus produces 65 jets per month and is booked with orders until 2029, Schaffrath said. By 2026, the jet manufacturer expects production to increase to 75 jets per month.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5294016003608704}",neutral,0.5294016003608704,0

For years, China has been working to change that, and this week it celebrated a milestone in that quest: the first commercial flight of a large passenger jet made in China.

The C919 jet, made by COMAC, a Chinese state-run aerospace manufacturer, flew about 130 passengers from Shanghai to Beijing for China Eastern Airlines on Sunday, according to Chinese state media. It is currently the only C919 plane being used for commercial flights.

COMAC, or the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, was established in 2008. Based in Shanghai, it is closely linked to AVIC, the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, which makes the country’s turboprops, fighter jets and bombers. The C919 is a narrow-body plane comparable to the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320.

Aviation experts said China faced stiff competition from the entrenched rivalry of U.S.-based Boeing and Airbus, a European company with national ownership stakes held by France, Germany and others. The two have dominated the sale of planes worldwide for years.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9979210495948792}",neutral,0.9979210495948792,0
"Airbus Sees Longer Aerospace Steel Lead Times, Supply Chain Challenges - Aviation Week","Wed, 21 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9zaG93bmV3cy9wYXJpcy1haXItc2hvdy9haXJidXMtc2Vlcy1sb25nZXItYWVyb3NwYWNlLXN0ZWVsLWxlYWQtdGltZXMtc3VwcGx5LWNoYWluLWNoYWxsZW5nZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LE BOURGET—Airbus is seeing new materials shortages emerge in the aerospace supply chain as other issues that have dominated in recent months begin to settle down.

“There are new difficulties with raw materials, particularly aerospace steel,” Chief Operating Officer Alberto Gutierrez tells ShowNews here at the Paris Air Show.

Steel is used in some aircraft parts that are exposed to particularly strong forces, such as the landing gear, and it is also used in castings and forgings. The lead time for steel orders “used to be eight months—now it is 20 months,” Gutierrez says.

The steel shortage is linked to the much higher demand in the defense industry since the start of the war in Ukraine in early 2022. There are three suppliers of aerospace steel, with Liberty Steel continuing a complex and lengthy financial restructuring process. So far, deliveries have not been impacted.

But Airbus is trying to mitigate the issue by planning combined bids on behalf of its suppliers in the future. The bids would bundle the needs of all of the suppliers, and Airbus would place the order. While lower price for the higher volumes could be a positive side effect, Gutierrez says bringing down cost is not the primary objective. No firm decision on the consolidated bidding process has been made.

The aircraft manufacturer presented the proposal to its key suppliers on June 20 at an ad-hoc meeting here at Le Bourget. The approach is already being used for aluminum.

“Everyone is trying to build buffers,” Gutierrez says. “But in difficult times, that means someone else may get nothing.” A production delay or pause at one supplier can have devastating effects on the OEM and the rest of the supply chain, as it can hold up aircraft deliveries. Gutierrez believes that suppliers are “willing to participate” in the new steel acquisition process, as it enhances schedule safety for everyone.

At the meeting, Airbus shared its production plans with Tier 1 suppliers.

Overall, Gutierrez says that “[fewer] suppliers are in crisis” today than in 2022. The chip shortage that Airbus had to deal with last year has largely been overcome, although the knock-on effects are still being felt at some companies. Delays remain in seat deliveries, which are holding up aircraft.

“We are starting to do better, but it is not enough,” Gutierrez says. “2023 is going to be difficult, and 2024 will remain difficult, but there is now a higher level of resilience, and we can absorb difficulties [better].”

In spite of the new aerospace steel shortage and some of the other continuing issues, Gutierrez is confident that Airbus will meet its 2023 delivery target of 720 aircraft. Airbus handed over 661 aircraft in 2022, significantly fewer than it had planned at the beginning of last year.

Production through the end of May went “pretty much as planned,” Gutierrez says. Engine deliveries are secured through year's end, and Airbus is still negotiating with Pratt & Whitney, CFM International and Rolls-Royce on engine output for 2024 and 2025. The Airbus COO stresses that the company is taking into account the needs of its customers that are waiting for spare engines for aircraft that have already been delivered. “We want the fleet to fly,” he says.

Airbus shifted focus from just-in-time deliveries when the parts shortages began to emerge in order to build up stock. That approach continues for the time being, and Gutierrez believes Airbus can slowly return to just-in-time from around the middle of 2024. “It has to be the right point in time,” he says.

Looking ahead, Airbus is planning a major overhaul of its supplier relationships and how schedules and shipments are managed. “We have a transactional IT [information technology] system, and we need to get to a collaborative system,” Gutierrez says, which would allow access to the entire supply chain. Such a system would enhance transparency of purchasing needs throughout the supply chain, he adds.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is to be used to identify bottlenecks early. Airbus has around 3,000 direct and 10,000 indirect suppliers. Around 2 million parts are delivered every day.

AI is already being used for 11 markers in the procurement wing of the Airbus Operating System. The markers—one of which signals how fast stock is depleted—are used to provide earlier warning signals to prevent shortages, Chief Procurement Officer Juergen Westermeier says.

With the new tool, Airbus can identify signs of potential issues five weeks in advance, thereby gaining time to take mitigating action. So far, the system includes Airbus and its affiliates Airbus Aerostructures and Airbus Atlantic, therefore giving it transparency over internal and Tier 1 components. At a future stage, the system could be expanded to include suppliers further down the chain. Rolling the system out on a broader basis will take until 2026, Gutierrez says.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9326610565185547}",negative,0.9326610565185547,-1

A lot has changed in the four years since one of the aviation industry's biggest air shows was held in person.

The Covid-19 pandemic devastated travel demand, the aviation industry shed thousands of experienced workers and roller coaster appetites for new jets wreaked havoc on production rates of new planes.

After all that, the Paris Air Show — a trade event where companies get a chance to showcase new technology, commercial and military aircraft, and strike deals — returns on Monday during a surge in air travel demand, with airlines starving for jets to feed it. The question is whether Boeing , Airbus and their numerous suppliers can catch up.

""That's creating pressure on the order books — it's creating upward momentum on used aircraft lease rates and forcing airlines to make compromises,"" said Andy Cronin, CEO of aircraft-leasing firm Avolon.

Aviation analytics firm IBA estimated last week that there could be orders for about 2,100 planes during the show as airlines replace older aircraft and prepare for future growth in air travel.

Over the past year, Boeing has logged large orders or preliminary agreements from customers including United Airlines , Saudia and new Saudi carrier Riyadh Air. Air India's massive order earlier this year included both Boeing and Airbus jets.

Turkish Airlines' chairman told reporters last month that the carrier is planning to order around 600 aircraft, both wide-body and narrow-body planes. The order would be the largest ever for a single airline, though it isn't clear whether that would come together in time for the show.

IBA's chief economist, Stuart Hatcher, wrote in a June 15 forecast that Delta Air Lines , Malaysia Airlines and Air France-KLM could be buyers, but the timing isn't yet certain. Air Baltic could also look to expand its Airbus A220 fleet, he said.

""It might still be too early to call any Chinese expansion yet given the political climate, but I wouldn't be surprised to see top-up orders coming through,"" Hatcher wrote.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6350167393684387}",neutral,0.6350167393684387,0

Managing Director of Airbus Helicopters in the UK, Lenny Brown, updates Rotor on the continuous expansion of the company’s UK footprint and reveals pioneering new projects that could enhance innovation throughout Airbus Helicopters’ military range.

“Every single military helicopter pilot in the UK is trained on Airbus H135s or H145s in the Military Flying Training System,” explains Lenny Brown as he highlights just how important Airbus Helicopters’ UK presence is. “There is also the facility supporting the Police Service Northern Ireland, a logistics footprint supporting the H175 helicopters flying oil and gas operations in Aberdeen and of course, our UK Headquarters in Oxford.” The UK operation has been based at Oxford Airport since the 1970s – offering a reliable stream of highly skilled jobs and local apprenticeships – and will celebrate its 50th anniversary next year.

In June 2024 the company will move into a newly built state-of-the-art facility on the other side of the airport. This project is part of Airbus’ continual investment in the UK, which sees the Group make significant annual investments. “It is simply part of our strategy to grow and enhance our capabilities,” which according to Brown need to be expanded and refreshed in order to appropriately cater to the size of the UK market. “We’re the only OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) in the UK that provides aircraft for the civil market, national resilience, parapublic and defence.”

The new facility will cut CO2 emissions by 50%, while the working environment will be more comfortable and efficient for colleagues. It will also improve things for other stakeholders by offering more room for student training, pilot training, customer visits and maintenance. ""It will offer us the ability to work on more aircraft at any given time. In terms of hangar space, we’ll have approximately a third more. It will also unite all the Oxford teams under one roof,” notes Brown.

Building on Airbus Helicopters’ strong UK presence

Oxford might not be the only place requiring new facilities. Should Airbus Helicopters’ bid for the UK Armed Forces’ New Medium Helicopter be successful, then the H175M will be assembled and exported from Airbus’ Broughton site – necessitating a new production line. As well as boosting the local economy by creating over 100 highly skilled jobs within Wales, a new production facility would be strategically important for both Airbus Helicopters and the UK. “This would be the first new helicopter production line in the UK for 50 years – which would clearly be a significant milestone in UK aviation but also a well overdue shot in the arm for the UK’s rotary wing industry,” reasons Brown. “It also supports Airbus Helicopters’ strategy of making the UK the fourth ‘core’ country of its strategic future and cements Airbus Helicopters in the UK’s position as part of the UK’s national security and national resilience architecture for the long term”.

The proposed new plant in Broughton adds weight to an Airbus’ bid which in total will create some 400 new jobs around the UK. With the proven template of the company’s Marignane H175 final assembly line, where the civil variant will continue to be made, supplemented by a team of production engineers working to further optimise a range of processes, it is clear that Airbus Helicopters is thinking ahead to ensure the potential deployment of an H175M fleet would go as quickly and as smoothly as possible. Brown commented, ""In planning future investment, we looked at where the Ministry of Defence spent most of its funding using the official Government surveys – the South West was a clear winner and by a significant margin. It was clear that Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland demanded our immediate attention for investments, which we are addressing.""

Catapulting military innovation

Airbus Helicopters UK’s defence portfolio has been increasing year on year since 2009. Such growth is attributable in equal parts to the quality of products and depth of support (with the SA 330 Puma MkII achieving particularly noteworthy operational performance) but also to the company’s continuous development. Brown highlights two projects that could significantly boost the already impressive culture of innovation - one supported by the UK’s Government-backed Catapult Network created to accelerate the application of research and development of new technologies in selected areas. “Firstly, we have joined a catapult, based in Wales called the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC). We’ve started some innovation projects with a number of SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises), looking at things like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), ballistic protection for current and future aircraft as well as high end composite type materials and future technologies,” says Brown.

This is the first time that Airbus Helicopters UK has been involved in a project like this and it has required an increased research and development budget, with the support of its headquarters in France. Though, declares Brown, this expenditure will be worth it in the medium to long term. “The advantages of the Catapult are that it will increase the intellectual property that we’re generating in the UK and also some of the projects are aircraft-agnostic so will be capable of being deployed across the entire fleet - a really efficient way to drive improvement and future capabilities.”

The power to adapt

The second project that will fuel future developments hinges on Airbus’ bid to supply the H175M as the UK Armed Forces’ New Medium Helicopter, as the company plans to substantially increase its military design and innovation capability in the UK.

The enhanced activity would focus on developing technological advancements that could be deployed throughout Airbus Helicopters’ entire military range – not only for the H175M. “Naturally there would be recruitment opportunities for aircraft designers, but part of this strategy would be to further foster our closer ties to universities and give more opportunities to PHD graduates,” says Brown.

One feature that Brown is particularly excited about is a proposed Capability Integration Rig which would be a tool for the Design Office to rapidly develop, design, certify, and then incorporate new capabilities onto the aircraft. Initially it would support the rapid development of the modifications of the H175M before initial delivery but later it would help Airbus – and indeed other companies in the H175M Task Force to implement new equipment on the aircraft throughout its life in response to customer demands and to exploit the digital design of all Airbus products.

The rig would enhance the prospective NMH but could be applied to other helicopters across the Airbus Helicopters range. According to Brown, the rig would speed up the integration of complex avionics systems and allow Airbus Helicopters to exploit open architecture systems both immediately and in the future – but with the most important benefit reserved for the operators themselves. “This ability to adapt quickly is what militaries are really after. As they deploy to an operational theatre and the threat changes or the operation changes, they would have the ability to improve the aircraft’s mission systems, Defensive Aid Suites (or Electronic Warfare Suites - EWS) much quicker than traditional processes have been able to deliver.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9941908717155457}",positive,0.9941908717155457,1
AIRBUS AND LANZAJET TO COLLABORATE ON SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL PRODUCTION - PR Newswire,"Thu, 22 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1cy1hbmQtbGFuemFqZXQtdG8tY29sbGFib3JhdGUtb24tc3VzdGFpbmFibGUtYXZpYXRpb24tZnVlbC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLTMwMTg1ODExNC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Memorandum of Understanding Between Aviation Leaders Aims to Advance LanzaJet SAF Production Facilities and Support Commercial Aviation Decarbonization Policy and Goals

CHICAGO, June 22, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- LanzaJet, a leading sustainable fuels technology company and Airbus, a global leader in the aerospace, commercial aircraft, helicopter, defense, and space sectors, today announced they have entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to address the needs of aviation through the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The agreement was signed by Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet and Julie Kitcher, EVP, Corporate Affairs and Sustainability at Airbus and announced during the Paris Air Show.

The MOU establishes a relationship between LanzaJet and Airbus to advance the building of SAF facilities which will use the LanzaJet Process™, a leading, proven, and proprietary Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology. This agreement also aims to accelerate the certification and adoption of 100% drop-in SAF which would eliminate the use of fossil fuels without necessitating any changes to existing aircraft or infrastructure. The aviation industry is responsible for approximately 2-3% of global carbon dioxide emissions, and SAF has been identified by airlines, governments, and energy leaders as one of the most immediate solutions to decarbonize aviation, together with the renewal of the fleets by latest generation aircraft and better operations.

""SAF is the best near-term solution to reducing aviation emissions and this collaboration between LanzaJet and Airbus is an important step forward in the fight against climate change and enabling the global energy transition,"" said Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet. ""We look forward to continuing our work with Airbus and further grow our joint impact across the globe.""

LanzaJet's proprietary ATJ technology uses low-carbon ethanol to create SAF that reduces greenhouse gas emissions by more than 70% percent compared to fossil fuels and can further decrease emissions with a suite of carbon reduction technologies. SAF produced through LanzaJet's ATJ technology is an approved drop-in fuel compatible with existing aircraft and infrastructure.

""We are delighted to grow our partnership with LanzaJet, a leading company in the SAF production ecosystem. At Airbus we are committed to supporting SAF as a major lever in the reduction of CO2 emissions on the decarbonization roadmap,"" says Julie Kitcher, EVP, Corporate Affairs and Sustainability at Airbus.

“We are looking at buying a number of extra aircraft,” Emirates Airline President Tim Clark said on the sidelines of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) annual general meeting in Istanbul June 6. Clark did not specify what the number is the airline is looking at or when it will make a decision. But he hinted that the carrier is in the process of retrofitting 140 aircraft (Boeing 777-300ERs and Airbus A380s) with new cabins to extend their service lives with Emirates and compensating for delivery delays that have severely impacted the carrier’s capacity planning. “They have a finite life,” Clark said.

The airline’s current fleet consists of 116 A380s and 157 777-300ERs, all of which must be replaced eventually, plus Emirates needs a lot more growth capacity for the medium and long term. The company has firm orders in place for 115 Boeing 777Xs, among them 80 777-9s and 35 777-8s. Emirates also ordered 30 787-9s and 50 A350s in 2019. However, the 787 order is currently “under discussion” according to Clark. He has indicated in the past that Emirates may end up not taking them.

The A350s will be the first new aircraft, to be delivered in July or August of 2024. Clark is also hopeful that Boeing will begin delivering 777-9s in the second half of 2025, more than five years later than originally planned.

Clark said he was “irritated” when Boeing postponed the 777-8 by several years, redesigned it and prioritized the freighter version, the 777-8F. The first Emirates aircraft would have been due for delivery in 2024, but now it will only come after the -8F. “It would have been nice if Boeing had asked us first,” Clark said. On the other hand, he has looked at the specifications of the redesigned 777-8 and thinks it could be “a very good aircraft.”

“It is imperative to us that Boeing get their act together and deliver the [777-9],” Clark said. “And the [U.S. Federal Aviation Administration] needs to arm itself with more human resources.”

Emirates operates 90-95 of the 116 A380s it has retained. The aircraft will begin to be retired by 2032, but the airline will continue to operate A380s through the 2030s, Clark said.

As for the new aircraft, Emirates is looking at ordering more 777-9s, A350s and potentially 787s, should the review of the existing order confirm that the airline will stick to the type. But even the A350, which will be the smallest type the airline operates in the future, will change the network substantially as it will allow Emirates to go into smaller markets for which the 777-300ER is too big. In particular, more points in Africa and Asia are considered.

Ahead of taking any new aircraft, Airbus has begun retrofitting the current fleet of A380s and 777s with new cabins as it plans to operate them longer than originally planned.

All the plans are being made against the backdrop of extremely strong demand. “For the next nine months we are full,” Clark said. “If the [Russia-Ukraine] war ends, I can see another kickstart to the global economy.” In his experience, demand “reshapes itself and grows” after every crisis.

In addition to increasing frequencies on existing markets, Emirates wants to add new destinations in Asia, Africa, Latin America and North America. Clark is encouraged by the first results coming out of codesharing with United and Air Canada, which “gives us enormous scope.”

By contrast, the limitations of the bilateral air services agreement between India and the United Arab Emirates continue to keep Emirates from adding more seats to what is expected to become the biggest growth market in aviation. Emirates and FlyDubai combined can offer 65,000 weekly seats in each direction per week, at the same time “demand is off the clock,” as Clark put it. Approaches to the Indian government about more capacity have been rejected. But he has hopes that once Air India is growing its international flying based on recent orders, the attitude will change. “If Air India wants to expand, [the government of India] cannot curtail the rights of airlines in markets it wants to grow into,” Clark said.

China is another issue: Emirates is limited to 35 weekly flights but would like to do much more as soon as possible.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999666213989258}",neutral,0.9999666213989258,0
Airbus wins record 500-plane order from India's IndiGo - CNBC,"Mon, 19 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDYvMTkvYWlyYnVzLXdpbnMtcmVjb3JkLTUwMC1wbGFuZS1vcmRlci1mcm9tLWluZGlhcy1pbmRpZ28uaHRtbNIBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIzLzA2LzE5L2FpcmJ1cy13aW5zLXJlY29yZC01MDAtcGxhbmUtb3JkZXItZnJvbS1pbmRpYXMtaW5kaWdvLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An IndiGo airlines passenger aircraft taxis on the tarmac at Chhatrapati Shivaji International airport in Mumbai, India, May 29, 2023.

Europe's Airbus announced the biggest plane deal in history on the opening day of the Paris Airshow on Monday, with an order for 500 narrowbody jets from Indian budget carrier IndiGo.

The multibillion-dollar deal is the largest ever by number of aircraft, eclipsing Air India's provisional purchase of 470 jets earlier this year as India's two largest carriers plan for a sharp expansion in regional travel demand.

The deal follows months of negotiations first reported by Reuters.

""This is just the beginning, there's more going forward. With the growth of India (and) the growth of the Indian aviation market ... this is the right time for us to place this order,"" IndiGo Chief Executive Pieter Elbers told a news conference.

The aircraft will be delivered between 2030 and 2035.

Efforts by Indian carriers to keep pace with the world's fastest-growing aviation market, serving the largest population, have sent industry records tumbling even though manufacturers are struggling to meet output goals.

Indian carriers now have the second-largest order book, with an over 6% share of the industry backlog, behind only the United States, according to a June 1 report by Barclays.

But some analysts have expressed concern that airlines could be over-ordering jets in pursuit of the same passengers.

After signing the IndiGo deal, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said it was premature to start thinking about narrowbody jet production rates higher than the planned 75 per month.

IndiGo, which accounts for nearly 60% of the Indian domestic market, was widely expected to keep Airbus as its supplier of single-aisle jets to squeeze out further economies of scale.

It continues to hold separate talks with Airbus and rival Boeing for 25 widebody planes, which could either be Airbus A330neos or Boeing 787 jets, sources have said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9991781115531921}",neutral,0.9991781115531921,0

Ku-band coming next, unlocking multi-constellation LEO+GEO coverage

Since the launch of the Airspace Link HBCplus solution at AIX 2022 with partners Inmarsat and Safran Passenger Innovations (SPI), Airbus has achieved significant headway: At APEX 2022, Airbus revealed SES as the second Managed Service Provider (MSP), offering its GEO+MEO Ka-band solution. Airbus’ airline customers therefore have the choice of SES and Inmarsat, and can switch between these MSPs while using the same terminal made available by SPI. Most recently, Airbus is pleased to announce Emirates Airline as the launch customer for HBCplus, outfitting 50 A350 aircraft. More airlines will be revealed soon.

Latest developments underway…

Responding to feedback from the market, Airbus has now started the development of a complementary HBCplus product in order to further broaden the MSP offer: Operating in the Ku-frequency band and being both GEO and LEO compatible, this latest solution will use ESA (Electronically Steered Antenna) technology to enable simultaneous multi-beam operation. This new product is planned to be offerable in the course of 2024.

With this Ku-band HBCplus solution, complementing the initial GEO+MEO Ka product, Airbus is on track to provide a full range of options for airlines, for simultaneous *GEO (Geostationary Earth Orbit), *MEO (Middle Earth Orbit), HEO (Highly Elliptical Orbit) and *LEO (Low Earth Orbit) connectivity.

New MSP partners for Ku-band services

For the Ku-band HBCplus capability Airbus is in advanced discussions with Intelsat and Panasonic, with MoUs signed, as the launch MSPs. HBCplus will enable these MSPs with GEO constellations to seamlessly integrate their chosen LEO operators, such as OneWeb, into their Ku service for their respective airline customers – using the same electronically-steered antenna (ESA). To this end, SPI has been selected as the terminal provider and hardware integrator for the development of the Ku-band ESA for HBCplus, which will come as a SFE line-fit catalogue option and also for retrofit on all Airbus programmes.

André Schneider, Airbus VP Cabin & Cargo Programme said: “Complementing our HBCplus offer with multi-constellation Ku-band solutions is a key step in our aim to provide flexibility of choice for airlines.”

He adds: “With this additional offer, Airbus’ customers will benefit from a wider choice of connectivity services with the same operational flexibility as offered by our Ka-band solution recently selected by Emirates on its A350 fleet. This will also enable passengers to enjoy an outstanding and seamless connectivity experience aboard Airbus aircraft.”

Please stay tuned for more details of the next product launch, delivering to our plan for more choice and flexibility for our customers.

The unlikely partnership, agreed to through a memorandum of understanding signed at the Paris Air Show here on June 21, will see the two companies deepen ties and further cooperate around training. The move comes as European nations introduce more complex combat aircraft such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and prepare for next generation platforms such the European Future Combat Air System (FCAS) being developed by France, Germany and Spain and the Global Combat Air Program (GCAP) being pursued by Italy, Japan and the UK.

Training fleets across Europe continue to rely on aging types, with France still flying the Dassault Alpha Jet, Spain using the Northrop SF-5 Freedom Fighter for lead-in fighter training and Germany relying on the T-38 Talon for training in the U.S. Some nations have adopted turboprop trainers such as the Pilatus PC-21, despite the leap in performance from the turboprop to advanced combat aircraft.

Airbus’ business in Spain proposed the development of a new advanced jet trainer but could not secure government backing to pursue the program.

“Leonardo is globally recognized as a key player in the military pilot training business segment, and we believe our synergies could give the right answer to our customer requirements,” said Jean Brice Dumont, head of military air systems at Airbus Defense and Space. He said that using a European platform would strengthen the European “defense environment” and achieve “strategic autonomy.”

Marco Zoff, Leonardo Aircraft Division’s managing director, said the agreement would see the two companies “combine their distinctive experience and capabilities.”

Airbus and Leonardo claim the European advanced trainer market could account for more than 400 new aircraft deliveries over the next 20 years.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9964918494224548}",neutral,0.9964918494224548,0

Last week's Paris Air Show highlighted how boom times have returned in the global aerospace industry. Boeing (BA -1.96%) and Airbus (EADSY -1.30%) each finalized hundreds of orders for new jets at the industry's marquee event of 2023. This marked a sharp shift in the environment compared to just a year or two ago.

However, one thing hasn't changed. Airbus continues to fly circles around Boeing, capitalizing on the popularity of its A320neo-family jets to capture far more orders than its American rival.

Boeing finalizes one major order

As expected, Air India firmed up a massive aircraft order (first announced back in February) during the Paris Air Show as it tries to regain relevance after being privatized last year. Boeing booked 220 firm orders: 190 for the 737 MAX, along with 20 for the 787 Dreamliner and 10 for the 777X. Air India also received options for an additional 50 737 MAX jets and 20 787s.

Unfortunately, Boeing didn't book many other big orders. The aircraft manufacturer did secure an order for 40 737 MAXs from aircraft leasing company Avolon. It also reported five small-scale orders covering a total of 16 737 MAXs and 10 787s.

These deals brought Boeing's total order haul for the week to 286 commercial jets, consisting of 246 narrow-bodies (i.e., 737 MAXs) and 40 wide-bodies (30 787s and 10 777Xs).

Airbus makes a huge splash

While Air India placed a sizable order with Boeing, it finalized an even bigger order with Airbus during the Paris Air Show. It ordered 250 Airbus jets: 210 from the A320neo family along with 40 A350s.

Yet even that order was small potatoes for Airbus last week. A day before announcing the Air India sale, Airbus signed a deal to sell 500 A320neo-family aircraft to top Indian airline IndiGo. Airbus also captured several smaller firm orders for a total of 30 A320neos, 12 A350s, and nine A220s.

These deals gave Airbus 801 firm orders for the week: 740 for the A320neo family, nine for the smaller A220, and 52 for the A350 wide-body family. Notably, in addition to dramatically expanding its narrow-body backlog advantage -- which was already substantial -- Airbus received more wide-body firm orders than Boeing last week. It also signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding for 20 A330neo wide-bodies with Avolon.

A big red flag

To some extent, the gap in order activity between Boeing and Airbus last week may reflect differences in order timing. Boeing booked more orders than Airbus in the first five months of the year, and management expects to finalize some sizable orders in the second half of 2023. Furthermore, Boeing is essentially sold out of delivery slots until 2028, giving it plenty of time to line up new orders.

That said, following its massive order haul last week, Airbus now has a commanding lead in year-to-date orders. Boeing has virtually no chance of catching up by year-end.

Moreover, Airbus already had a dominant share of the duopoly's order backlog for narrow-bodies: the largest and fastest-growing segment of the market. The European aerospace giant now has over 7,000 unfilled narrow-body orders, compared to fewer than 4,500 for Boeing. That will support Airbus' plans to ramp up production aggressively over the next several years.

Airbus' big win at the Paris Air Show also reiterated the company's advantage over Boeing in India and China: the two most important growth markets for commercial aviation. IndiGo, which operates an all-Airbus fleet, holds a commanding 56% share of India's domestic market. Many of its competitors that have ordered Boeing jets have struggled to compete effectively and may never take delivery of those aircraft. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China have given Airbus a big advantage in the latter market.

In the near term, Boeing's biggest challenge is ramping up production following a slew of miscues in recent years. But once Airbus and Boeing meet the current burst of pent-up demand, Boeing will face an uphill battle to maintain its market share. Between its inferior narrow-body product lineup and Airbus' entrenched advantage in China and India, Boeing could be in for another reckoning by the early 2030s.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9335585236549377}",neutral,0.9335585236549377,0

"Lockheed, Airbus Expect U.S. Air Force To Increase Short-Term Tanker Buy - Aviation Week","Thu, 22 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9kZWZlbnNlLXNwYWNlL2J1ZGdldC1wb2xpY3ktb3BlcmF0aW9ucy9sb2NraGVlZC1haXJidXMtZXhwZWN0LXVzLWFpci1mb3JjZS1pbmNyZWFzZS1zaG9ydC10ZXJt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LE BOURGET—Lockheed Martin and Airbus expect to see the U.S. Air Force revert to something resembling its original tanker replacement plan, buying more refuelers after the end of its Boeing KC-46 program to bridge a gap to an advanced, clean-sheet design that is likely to come later than the service is hoping for.

The Air Force announced in March it would cancel its proposed plan to buy 150 or more tankers to come online after the last of 179 KC-46s are delivered in 2029 and before a future replacement comes in the 2040 timeframe. The plan now is to accelerate that future tanker, called the Next-Generation Aerial Refueling System (NGAS), to the mid-2030s and buy a smaller amount of additional KC-46s to cover the shorter gap.

The service contends there is no need to start a new developmental contest to cover the smaller gap with a reduced fleet, and the U.S. Congress is currently considering the approach as part of the fiscal 2024 defense policy bill.

Lockheed Martin has teamed up with Airbus to offer a modified A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT), called LMXT, for the program. The LMXT takes the in-use MRTT and adds U.S.-specific capabilities, such as new operator stations for command and control and under-belly tanks to provide increased amounts of fuel. Lockheed announced earlier this month it had selected GE Aerospace’s CF6-80E1 to power its fleet.

Greg Ulmer, Lockheed’s executive vice president for aeronautics, told Aerospace DAILY his expectation is the NGAS program would be pushed out to the future because of some of the new technology required. The Air Force has asked for a clean-sheet design with a focus on connectivity and survivability, and has raised the possibility of using a blended-wing-body (BWB) design.

Ulmer said with NGAS moving to later in the decade, the service would need more tankers in the interim to get there. Lockheed has said it could deliver LMXTs, first built by Airbus in France and Spain, by 2029 as it builds facilities in Alabama and Georgia. The Air Force, however, had said it expects LMXTs would be delivered much later, starting in 2034. Both Airbus and Lockheed contest that date.

Jean-Brice Dumont, head of military air systems at Airbus, said during a June 20 press conference at the Paris Air Show here that he did not know where that date came from, adding, ""We will deliver way earlier.""

That specifically depends on requirements, which will guide how the companies will “tune our configuration and then meet the schedule,” Dumont said.

“So that requires us to stay very, very close to the buyer, to have the right configuration and to hit the ground running,” he said. “We have defined our setup.”

Ulmer said he expects requirements for the program, now known as the KC-135 Recapitalization, to come out in the third or fourth quarter of this fiscal year. The requirements for NGAS would take shape over the next four to five years, he said.

Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall specifically mentioned BWB as a potential characteristic of NGAS. The service wants to fly a BWB prototype in 2027, with a selection expected soon under a Defense Innovation Unit effort. Though some companies have pressed forward on this idea, such as JetZero recently unveiling a dual military and commercial design earlier this year, neither Airbus nor Lockheed Martin are as excited.

“I think we’re not far,” Dumont said. “What we’re thinking about refueling at large is that you a need a big station in the air, and we don’t necessarily see how you could have a blended-wing body of that size in the near to mid-term.”

A BWB would be more likely in the 2040-and-beyond timeframe, not mid-2030s, Ulmer says. The LMXT includes some capabilities he sees as the “beginnings” of NGAS, including the autonomous refueling Airbus has demonstrated and a possibility to fly with reduced crew—a priority recently expressed by the Air Force's Air Mobility Command. The specifics will need to be outlined by the service, so designs can be refined.

“The requirement definitions and the technology required to meet those requirements remain to be seen,” Ulmer said in an interview at Lockheed Martin’s Le Bourget chalet. “And what kind of stealth characteristics, how much fuel do you want to offload, do you want to be penetrating ... All those things remain to be seen, and so those will define the time horizon required to meet the requirements.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998233914375305}",neutral,0.9998233914375305,0

The fleet will replace the country’s aging AS532 Cougar medium-weight multipurpose helicopter, in service for almost 30 years.

It will be deployed for special operations under the Royal Netherlands Air Force Defence Helicopter Command.

Alongside the aircraft, Airbus will provide new mission equipment and a temporary simulation capability to train aircrews for the Caracals.

Deliveries will begin in early 2028. The units will be stationed at Gilze-Rijen Air Base.

Meanwhile, an upgrade is being provided for 12 Cougar helicopters to extend their operational life until 2030.

Airbus H225M Caracal

The Caracal is a “combat-proven” twin-engine aircraft with a capacity for up to 28 seated soldiers and two aircrew, depending on user requirements.

Airbus offers the helicopter for troop transport, combat search and rescue, and casualty evacuation, similar to the company’s EC225 Super Puma civilian chopper.

Users of Caracal include the armed forces of France, Mexico, Brazil, and several Asian countries.

Caracals can operate from land and surface vessels in extreme environmental conditions and at night.

The rotorcraft is powered by two Makila 2A1 engines and a five-blade rotor for low vibration levels and has a range of 70 nautical miles (130 kilometers/81 miles).

In addition, the helicopter can be integrated with mounted machine guns, rocket launchers, aerial torpedoes, anti-ship and guided missiles, and a countermeasures suite.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.99998939037323}",neutral,0.99998939037323,0
"A380 Cracking Issue Will Not Change Storage Guidance, Airbus Says - Aviation Week","Wed, 14 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9tcm8vc2FmZXR5LW9wcy1yZWd1bGF0aW9uL2EzODAtY3JhY2tpbmctaXNzdWUtd2lsbC1ub3QtY2hhbmdlLXN0b3JhZ2UtZ3VpZGFuY2UtYWlyYnVzLXNheXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A certain combination of heat and humidity is forcing Airbus A380 operators to tighten an established wing-spar inspection program and causing some to change fleet deployment plans.

A May 11 European Union Aviation Safety Agency directive requires A380 operators to calculate “factored time on ground” (FTOG) and conduct inspections based on Airbus’ revised criteria. The mandate is based on a May 11 Airbus operators’ telex.

The new mandate builds on existing inspection criteria for A380 wingbox areas—the top and bottom flanges of the outer rear spar (ORS) between Ribs 33 and 49, the outer inner front spar between Ribs 8 and 14 and the outer front spar between Ribs 38 and 49. The original directive was issued in 2019, covering only part of the affected area and setting inspection thresholds starting 15 years after the wingbox assembly date. Feedback from operators and additional work by Airbus prompted subsequent directives expanding the areas that needed checks and shortening the inspection thresholds. A 2022 directive required ORS inspections 11.5 years after the wingbox assembly date.

The new criteria affect only the ORS area. Airbus has flagged a phenomenon called hydrogen-assisted cracking, or hydrogen embrittlement, as the cause of accelerated crack development on A380s that have been stored for extended periods of time.

“The biggest driver is temperature; the second is moisture,” Pierre-Henri Brousse, head of the A380 program, tells Aviation Week. When aircraft are on the ground and exposed to extreme weather conditions, hydrogen is diffused into the materials and causes embrittlement of the aluminum alloy, which in turn makes the propagation of cracks easier, he explains. A combination of FTOG, the aircraft’s age and a maximum takeoff weight threshold of 510 tons are considered when determining the new check intervals.

But that remained insufficient. “We inspected some aircraft that were younger than the threshold” in the 2022 directive, Brousse says. “And we had some findings.”

Airbus then launched a deep dive into the data to try to understand why aircraft as young as 10 years (after wingbox assembly and therefore with sometimes significantly fewer years in revenue service) were developing the cracks. “We accumulated a sample that became statistically relevant,” Brousse says. Eventually, the research yielded results—namely that storage conditions have an effect on how fast the cracking develops.

Among the new triggers for ORS inspections is an aircraft returning to service after 12 or more months in storage. Wing inspections take about one week, and the nondestructive checks are typically performed by airlines in-house.

Many current A380 operators are in the process of returning more aircraft from storage, given how quickly demand has rebounded on long-haul routes and supply chain issues that have held up some deliveries. The Aviation Week Network’s Fleet Discovery database shows 135 A380s are in active service, with Emirates operating 87 of them, Singapore Airlines and British Airways each flying 11, and Qatar Airways and Qantas operating seven and six, respectively.

Airbus has not said which operators have been hit hardest by the issues, but Emirates said in November 2022 that it has been affected. The airline had parked many of its A380s at Al Maktoum International Airport during the coronavirus pandemic, where they were exposed to particularly high temperatures and humidity during summer. Emirates has returned younger aircraft first to avoid running into inspection intervals for as long as possible.

Qatar Airways and Etihad are two more Gulf carriers with A380 fleets, though Etihad is beginning only now to return its A380s to service.

Airbus says the recent findings will not “substantially change” its recommendations for aircraft storage. The aluminum alloy of the affected spars is no longer used in any other Airbus aircraft and is changed to a different material when parts are replaced during repairs.

“We have no concerns for other components,” Brousse says.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999505281448364}",neutral,0.9999505281448364,0
Airbus Canada Sees ‘No Strong Red Flags’ For A220 Production Hike - Aviation Week,"Wed, 21 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9zaG93bmV3cy9wYXJpcy1haXItc2hvdy9haXJidXMtY2FuYWRhLXNlZXMtbm8tc3Ryb25nLXJlZC1mbGFncy1hMjIwLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24taGlrZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LE BOURGET—Airbus Canada has not identified “very strong red flags” as it continues a planned steep production ramp-up in the A220 program, according to Airbus Canada CEO Benoit Schultz.

“The situation is dynamic,” he told ShowNews at the Paris Air Show June 21. His assessment is a “snapshot” that Airbus is “taking at high frequency.”

Airbus delivered 19 A220-300s in the first five months of 2023. That compares to 47 A220-300s and six -100s for full-year 2022. Deliveries for the first five months of 2023 are equivalent to a rate of less than four aircraft per month. Airbus plans to increase output to 14 aircraft per month from a nominal six aircraft monthly, a level of production it has not reached yet this year. Schultz nonetheless claims that the first half of the year was “much better” and the final assembly line (FAL) had a “strong start of the year.”

Schultz added that there was a “minimum level of outstanding work” and aerostructures deliveries to the FAL are now stable, though “there is some level of tension on the engine side.” Schultz was referring to Pratt & Whitney engine delivery delays and PW1500G durability issues that have been impacting the in-service fleet. Engines are “not a production tracer today,” he said.

In his view, the short-term relief for airlines is in added MRO capacity to shorten the time needed for repairs. Upgrades planned to the engine will also “improve time on wing,” Schultz said.

Schultz said adding another engine type to the program was a “substantial undertaking” for which “you need a trigger.” Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury told Aviation Week in a recent interview that he would welcome adding a second engine manufacturer to the program if and when Airbus decided to stretch the aircraft. Schultz did not say when Airbus was ready to launch a stretch.

According to industry sources, work on defining a larger version of the A220 is still ongoing. Keeping range similar to that of the current A220-300 would require substantial engineering work plus a more powerful engine. In addition to the current Pratt offering, GE Aerospace has indicated interest in joining the program.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.997154951095581}",neutral,0.997154951095581,0

There's often talk about a new hydrogen economy, but there's much more to this than simply swapping out fossil fuels for hydrogen. The two are very different things and require much more than just an engine that's been modified to burn hydrogen. It requires complete systems and engineering at a very basic level.

Working with ArianeGroup, an Airbus–Safran joint venture, Airbus has completed testing a complete system for feeding hydrogen to an aeronautical gas turbine engine. The HyPERION project, named after a French acronym for hydrogen for environmentally responsible aviation propulsion, began in December 2020 and is aimed at producing practical hydrogen commercial airliners by 2035. Its purpose is to both test technologies to make sure they work with a high degree of security and to identify areas where more work is needed.

In this case, the idea is to combine Airbus's expertise in aircraft construction with ArianeGroup's liquid hydrogen systems developed for the Ariane family of space rockets. In the new system, the hydrogen is stored as a supercooled liquid in cryogenic tanks. This is dispensed into the fuel system, which preheats the liquid, turning it back into gas that is delivered to the engines at the optimal temperature and pressure.

ArianeGroup's Vernon test facility carried out tests with the French aerospace lab ONERA, looking at compatible metals and the hydrogen conditioning system in a proof-of-concept test on May 12, 2023 that used an electric pump, gas generator, and heat exchangers originally developed for the Ariane rockets.

HyPower infographic Airbus

In another project, Airbus UpNext is working on a demonstrator program to replace the 'hidden' engine on an airliner.

If you ask most people how many engines there are on a passenger aircraft, they'll probably count the ones hanging off the wings, but there's one more jet engine tucked away in the tail of the plane. This is the APU, which is a jet turbine engine that is hooked to a generator to supply the aircraft onboard lighting, galley, and cockpit avionics with electricity and also pressurizes the cabin while supplying heating and cooling.

What Airbus wants to do is to build a technology demonstrator called HyPower by 2025 that will replace the APU on an Airbus A330 with a hydrogen fuel cell that will reduce the emissions and noise levels of a conventional unit.

""These tests will mark a new step in our decarbonization journey and ZEROe program through an ambitious flight demonstration that will take to the air by end 2025,"" said Michael Augello, CEO of Airbus UpNext. ""We want to demonstrate the operability and integration of the system, including refueling the aircraft with hydrogen. We will demonstrate this system in realistic conditions, climbing to 25,000 ft (7,620 m) and flying for one hour with 10 kg (22 lb) of gaseous hydrogen on board. However, we cannot do this alone and our cooperation with the Spanish Government and external partners will be key enablers of these series of tests.""

A stretched version of the A220 would be capable of accommodating up to 170 passengers, positioning it within the same category as the A320 and 737, but with enhanced fuel efficiency and reduced noise levels. This would provide operators with improved choices for short to medium-haul routes, delivering enhanced seat-kilometer performance.

Speaking to ATW at the Paris Air Show, Hulst explained that the potential introduction of the A220-500 would offer growth opportunities for existing A220 customers. However, it would also “divide the market” and undermine the advantages of commonality for Airbus customers, he says.

“The only thing that A220s and A320s share is the name Airbus—there's nothing similar about the cockpit or the maintenance of the aircraft,” Hulst says. “Obviously, I can see why customers want it, but I also see why creates a lot of risk for Airbus from their product strategy standpoint.”

Hulst adds that Boeing has “the right tools to compete” with both the A220 and A320 family, as well as the potential competitive threat of the A220-500.

Airbus CCO Christian Scherer has previously stated the A220-500 is a matter of “when,” rather than “if.” However, in May, the company announced that it would not be launching the variant at the Paris Air Show in 2023, saying the A220-100 and A220-300 remain the priority in the current environment.

Instead, it is anticipated that the launch of the A220-500 will likely take place closer to the middle of the decade, with the aircraft expected to enter service around 2030.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8743459582328796}",positive,0.8743459582328796,1

Airbus Widebody Aircraft: 10 Years of Excellence - Airways Magazine,"Fri, 16 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXdpZGVib2R5LWFpcmNyYWZ0LTEwLXllYXJzLW9mLWV4Y2VsbGVuY2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DALLAS – On June 14, 2013, the Airbus A350 XWB flew for the first time from Toulouse-Blagnac Airport (TLS); Airbus’ Megafactory. Ten years later, the widebody gem of the European manufacturer has become one of the most successful long-haul aircraft in the world, and is still beating fuel efficiency and passenger comfort records every single day.

At the moment of writing, the Airbus A350’s three variants—A350-900, A350-1000, and A350 Freighter—have achieved 535 deliveries and 967 firm orders and are most likely to surpass the 1000 order mark next week during the Paris Air Show 2023 edition.

The second widebody product from Airbus, the A330neo reached 291 firm orders from 25 different customers in May 2023. The replacement airframe for the successful A330ceo series has seen the delivery of its 100th unit in under four years of production.

Thanks to a thorough market study, technological and engineering development, and the international cooperation of the Airbus enterprise, Europe has become one of the leading continents in terms of long-haul commercial aviation.

Airways was invited to the 10th A350 First Flight Anniversary Meeting by Airbus where we received the latest updates on orders and deliveries, technological advances, and future strategies of the Airbus widebody fleet, ranging from the smallest Airbus A330-800neo to the newest Airbus A350 Freighter.

About the 10th Anniversary Meeting

The meeting was held exactly 10 years after the first flight of the Airbus A350-900 at the Toulouse Airbus factory hangars. We had the opportunity to talk with spokespeople Stan Shparberg, Head of Marketing at Airbus Commercial Aircraft, and Florent Massou, Head of the Airbus Widebody Programme to get the latest updates and answers to our inquiries.

Stan Shparberg has been with Airbus since March 2020, joining the manufacturer as Vice President of Airbus’ Corporate Jets division, which today has a wide business aircraft product offering, ranging from the smallest Airbus ACJ “TwoTwenty” to the largest ACJ350, the quietest VIP aircraft offering up to 22 hours of non-stop flying.

Today, Shparberg holds the position of Head of Marketing at Airbus and is accountable for promoting and selling commercial aircraft designed and manufactured by Airbus. Since the first Airbus A300 series in 1974 with Air France (AF), Airbus has delivered over 11,000 aircraft.

Florent Massou has been the Senior Vice President of the Airbus A330 and A350 family programs since July 2022. In his earlier years, he played a significant role in the technical and commercial development of important Airbus aircraft, such as the A320 series until 2014 and the A380 until 2018. Before joining the widebody division in 2021, he was the SVP and Head of the Airbus A220 program.

As the Senior Vice President of the Airbus A330 and A350 family programs, Massou is responsible for all important decisions and strategic planning. His extensive experience in the aviation sector and contributions to various departments in the French government have contributed to making the Airbus widebody family one of the most successful aircraft in the history of commercial aviation.

Maiden Flight of the Airbus A350

The Airbus A350 is currently the flagship of Airbus’ long-haul aircraft lineup and was designed to have the highest level of convenience and performance within the family. It was introduced in 2004 as an improvement on the already successful A330 family, incorporating new technologies such as composite materials and engines. These continue to be the key features of the Airbus A350 today.

Initially, the A350 concept closely resembled the A330 in terms of its shape, with the fuselage, wings, and tail forms closely resembling those of its predecessor. The primary change was the materials used to construct the aircraft. However, this proposal was not well-received by the aviation industry, with airlines claiming that the upcoming Boeing 787 would outclass the new Airbus plane and make it uncompetitive.

As a result, the European factory ultimately decided to completely overhaul the product. At the 2006 Farnborough International Airshow, they introduced the brand new Airbus A350 XWB, which stands for ‘Xtra-Wide-Body’. Singapore Airlines (SQ) then placed the first order for 20 units of the type just four days later.

Initially, Airbus launched three variants of the A350: A350-800 (275 seats), A350-900 (315 seats), and A350-1000 (370 seats). The key advantage of the A350 was its increased cabin width, which offered more space for airlines to work with, allowing for additional seats or improved passenger comfort through an increased pitch.

In 2009, the production of the first Airbus A350-900 began, and the aircraft had its inaugural flight at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport (TLS) on June 14, 2013. Peter Chandler, Airbus’ chief test pilot, expressed his satisfaction with the flight, stating that “it just seemed really happy in the air” and that there were no major issues with the tests.

Main Objectives of the Airbus A350

The Airbus A350 was specifically designed to prioritize “unbeatable fuel efficiency.” To ensure this success, the fuselage and wings are made of composite materials primarily consisting of carbon fiber-reinforced polymers and aluminum, which were some of the most innovative components of the aircraft. Additionally, the new Rolls Royce Trent XWB engine has a 9.6:1 bypass ratio, which significantly reduces fuel burn.

In addition, the design team incorporated the latest technologies and aerodynamic advancements to optimize the wing design and reduce aerodynamic drag. For the first time, Airbus introduced “blended winglets” into the Airbus A350 family. This design feature was later also applied to the A330neo series.

All of these features, combined with the state-of-the-art avionics systems and revolutionary “fly-by-wire” concept, make the Airbus A350 XWB one of the most fuel-efficient airplanes available. It burns up to 25% less fuel than previous-generation aircraft.

Furthermore, the A350’s “Xtra-Wide-Body” offers airlines the opportunity to revolutionize the passenger experience by implementing innovative concepts that increase passenger capacity without sacrificing customer comfort. This has enabled airlines such as Qatar Airways (QR), with its renowned QSuite Business Class seat, and Iberia (IB), with its recent “A350 Next” cabin, to realize their visions using this aircraft.

As of May 2023, more than 50 operators have put their faith in Airbus’s flagship model, the A350. However, the A350 has faced setbacks during both the development and operational phases due to numerous quality and design issues, leading airlines worldwide to ground their airplanes and demand immediate resolutions from the manufacturer.

The Airbus-Qatar Airways A350 Battle

In January 2021, the aviation world was taken by surprise when QR accused Airbus of providing aircraft with low-quality paint on the fuselage of the Airbus A350. The hot climate of Qatar caused severe degradation and loss of paint from the body and winglets, forcing the airline to ground at least 20 entire units for years.

This led to a highly publicized and even legal battle between the two parties, as Qatar Airways sought compensation from Airbus for the unavoidable grounding of almost half of its A350 fleet. Despite this, Qatar CEO Akbar Al Baker expressed hope that the dispute could be resolved without resorting to the courts, acknowledging that every partnership experiences disagreements.

To this day, QR continues to have 10 Airbus A350-900 aircraft grounded in Doha, and since November 2021, the airline has leased up to eight Boeing 777-300ER aircraft temporarily to bridge the operational gap left by the grounded fleet.

In February 2023, Airbus and QR settled the dispute and agreed to work together on design changes to the A350 painting process and get all the grounded A350s back in the skies.

Airbus stated, “Qatar Airways and Airbus are pleased to have reached an amicable and mutually agreeable settlement in relation to their legal despite over A350 surface degradation and the grounding of A350 aircraft. The settlement agreement is not an admission of liability for either party. This agreement will enable QR and Airbus to move forward and work together as partners.”

The A350 Project Today

At the 10th anniversary meeting, Stan Shparberg said, “The A350 is shaping the future of air travel and air freight”, referring to the clear importance of the Airbus A350 in the plans of the manufacturer. Today, ten years after the first flight of the A350, the airplane is a key piece in the development of the following three big plans and strategies in the aviation industry.

Firstly, Qantas Airways (QF) has opted for the Airbus A350-1000ULR variant for its ambitious ‘Project Sunrise‘, which aims to establish non-stop flights between Sydney (SYD) and distant destinations such as London (LHR), Paris (CDG), and New York (JFK). Recently, the airline introduced special passenger cabins to enhance the comfort of these +20-hour flights.

Secondly, Airbus is re-entering the air freight market by launching the A350F, a cargo variant of the successful twin-engine jet. The European manufacturer is optimistic about the project, predicting a market share of 42% for the A350F compared to rival Boeing 777-8F, which is anticipated to cover 58% of the market share within the 777X family.

Additionally, the Airbus A350 Freighter is set to feature the widest cargo door ever to fly, with a width 17% greater than that of the 150-inch door on the Boeing 777F family. Furthermore, the maximum payload of the A350F has been increased by two tons, enabling airlines to transport up to 111 tons of cargo per flight, thus boosting the profit margins of air freight operations.

Lastly, Airbus has taken strides towards sustainability by increasing the proportion of Sustainable Fuel (SAF) used during flight tests and Beluga XL transport flights. Airbus anticipates that this action will result in a reduction of 3 million tonnes of CO2 emissions by 2033. Additionally, the manufacturer expects to achieve 100% SAF certification within the next few years.

The Airbus A350 in Numbers

Since the launch of the program in 2004, the Airbus A350 XWB has completed an outstanding order book of 967 units of all its variants from 54 total customers. Of those aircraft, more than half, 535 in total, have been delivered to 40 operators. This means that the backlog of the A350 includes 393 passenger variants and 39 freighters to be produced.

The largest operator of the Airbus A350 is SQ with 62 units as of May 2023. It is closely followed by QR, which flies 55 and is also the largest operator of the longer A350-1000 variant, with 21 units in total. For the Airbus A350F version, both Singapore Airlines and Etihad Airways (EY) are the largest customers at the moment, with seven aircraft each.

In terms of passenger capacity, the airline that has configured its aircraft with the densest capacity is the European low-cost leisure carrier French Bee (BF), which operates an all-A350 fleet, of which two A350-1000s feature a cabin fit for 480 passengers in a two-class layout, which is the maximum allowed by the manufacturer.

Regarding route networks, it is known that Qantas plans to operate non-stop flights from Sydney to London under “Project Sunrise” using the A350-1000ULR. Currently, however, the longest route served by an Airbus A350 is Singapore Airlines flight SQ22, which covers a distance of 9,537 miles between Singapore-Changi Airport (SIN) and New York-John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK).

Conversely, the world’s shortest Airbus A350 flight is less than 20 minutes long and connects the African cities of Douala (DLA), in Cameroon, and Malabo (SSG), in Equatorial Guinea. This brief flight, Ethiopian Airlines (ET) Airbus A350-900 flight ET913, which operates four times a week, spans a mere 72 miles and is 132 times shorter than flight SQ22.

Airbus is currently developing its Airbus A350 NPS program for both passenger variants, with expected production to start in the coming months. It is likely that the factory will announce the introduction dates and launch customers of the NPS project during the upcoming 2023 Paris Air Show.

In addition, Airbus is focusing on the new “Fello’fly” project, which involves creating a new Airbus A350 demonstrator aircraft. The goal is to improve air travel performance by utilizing wake turbulence from other planes to provide lift to following airframes, similar to the way flocks of birds have flown in nature for centuries.

This innovative flying concept could lead to a 5% reduction in fuel consumption and, in the future, could be implemented on aircraft traveling close together for long trips, such as transatlantic flights. The project will require new onboard technologies and ground equipment and is not set to launch until 2026.

The Airbus A330neo

Although the A350 family has always been the focus of attention for the industry and customers due to its innovative technology, Airbus has also developed a secondary product that is intended to replace the A330-200 and 300 variants. This product, known as the A330-800neo and 900neo aircraft, was launched by the manufacturer in July 2014.

The objective of the A330neo family was to offer customers new aircraft with the same performance as the massively successful A330ceo series, but with better fuel efficiency. To achieve this, the A330neo family was launched with new Rolls Royce Trent 7000 engines, which have a double bypass ratio compared to their predecessor.

In addition to the new engines, the A330neo also incorporates optimized pylons and winglets similar to those on the A350 airplane, which improve aerodynamics by 4%. Despite this, up to 95% of the fuselage, avionics, and wing structure remains similar to the former A330ceo, which may not have fully convinced some customers looking for a new aircraft.

The birth of the A330neo was heavily influenced by the failure of the smallest member of the A350 family – the A350-800, which had a very similar capacity and range. However, it only received 182 orders and was eventually replaced by the larger A350-900. In 2014, Airbus decided to discontinue the shorter version and instead offered the A330neo as a replacement for aging widebody fleets.

Despite being launched almost 10 years ago, the Airbus A330neo has only received a total of 289 orders from 130 customers, of which 102 have already been delivered. The fact that there are a large number of operators compared to the order list indicates that the A330neo is not being considered as a replacement aircraft. Instead, it is seen as a stand-alone widebody solution for airlines looking to operate a small long-haul fleet.

The Airbus A330neo in Numbers

The largest operator of the Airbus A330neo is Delta Air Lines (DL), with a total of 22 units, all of the A330-900 variant. Unlike other airlines, DL has understood the initial concept of the project and may use it as a replacement for its aging A330-200/300 fleet, which has an average age of 16 years. The airline is still waiting for 14 more units to be delivered in the coming years.

TAP Air Portugal (TP) is the second largest operator of the A330neo, with 19 aircraft. They were also the launch customer of the A330-900 airframe back in November 2018. The re-engined version plays a large role in the transatlantic network of the carrier and has replaced the aging A340-300s, allowing TAP to offer some of the most competitive prices in the market.

Kuwait Airways (KU) has the largest fleet of the A330-800, with four units delivered. These aircraft fly long-haul routes along with their predecessor, the A330-200, to destinations in Asia, Europe, and North America. KU operates the longest A330-800 route in the world, from Kuwait City (KWI) to New York-JFK (JFK), which covers 6,352 miles in around 12 and a half hours of flight time.

Differing from its larger sister, the shorter A330-800 variant, which can only carry between 220 and 260 passengers in a typical configuration, is struggling to find new customers as it has currently only delivered seven airframes to just three operators. It has only received 12 orders in 10 years.

About the clear lack of orders for the short version of the A330neo, Stan Shparberg said, “We definitely see the compelling future for our A330-800. The reason we haven’t seen as many orders for that platform is that the replacement wave for the A330-200 has not begun quite yet, but we are seeing that is going to come very soon and it has been delayed somehow by the COVID-19 crisis.”

Is the A330neo Program Doomed?

It’s evident that the Airbus A330neo program has not performed well in the market, even after having a decade to establish its position. Part of the reason for this, as stated by Mr. Shparberg, is that the A330neo is too advanced for its time. Though designed to replace the previous generation in the family, airlines are not investing in the project if they don’t currently need to replace their current fleets.

Airbus had always acknowledged that the Airbus A330neo product would not sell as well as the A350 XWB, and they expected fewer orders. However, as of now, less than 20% of the airlines that operate the A330-200 and 300 variants have chosen to purchase the A330neo family as a replacement. Thus, it’s clear that the program is not fulfilling its initial objectives. In contrast, 30 airlines that once operated the A330 now trust the A350.

Does this indicate that the Airbus A330neo program has failed? Recently, Airbus confirmed that none of the variants of the A330neo will be present at the 2023 Paris Air Show display. As a result, the manufacturer won’t have a direct-selling product to entice more customers into purchasing the airplane. Instead, Airbus is focusing on promoting and advertising the A350-1000 and A321XLR, among others.

In reality, only time will tell. For at least the next five years, the life cycle of the current Airbus A330 planes currently in service won’t be a priority for operators. Consequently, there is no clear demand for an aircraft replacement at the moment.

Furthermore, airlines have demonstrated a greater inclination to invest in a brand-new airplane like the A350 instead of buying an aircraft that’s up to 95% identical to its predecessor. This trend was apparent in 2004 with the first A350 aircraft concepts as well.

“It is difficult to overstate the significance of IndiGo’s new historic order for 500 Airbus A320 family aircraft,” IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers said. “An order book now of almost 1000 aircraft well into the next decade, enables IndiGo to fulfil its mission to continue to boost economic growth, social cohesion and mobility in India.”

IndiGo, which now operates a fleet of about 300 aircraft, a mix of A320 models and ATR turboprops. It had 477 Airbus jets on order before today’s deal.

The deal comes a few months after IndiGo rival Air India placed an order for 470 commercial jets, split between Boeing and Airbus. It sets the stage for significant growth and a major confrontation between the two carriers and a handful of smaller competitors in a fight for market share in the world’s largest country.

Currently, there are about 700 aircraft in the combined fleets of all Indian airlines, which will need to increase infrastructure and hire flight crews and maintenance technicians to support all the new planes coming to them.

IndiGo could be back with another order before the end of the air show. According to Indian media reports, the airline is in talks with both Boeing and Airbus on a potential order for 20 widebodies. The airline is said to be leaning towards 787s or A350s, but may order A330s, according to the reports.

IndiGo currently wet-leases a handful of Boeing 777s that fly routes between India and Turkey.
