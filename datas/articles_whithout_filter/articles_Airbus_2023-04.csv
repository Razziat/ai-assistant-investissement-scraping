Airbus widens its lead over Boeing in China with plans for second finishing line - CNN,"Fri, 07 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNC8wNi9idXNpbmVzcy9haXJidXMtY2hpbmEtYm9laW5nLWxvY2tvdXQvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBR2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjMvMDQvMDYvYnVzaW5lc3MvYWlyYnVzLWNoaW5hLWJvZWluZy1sb2Nrb3V0?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New York CNN —

Airbus announced plans Thursday for a second final-assembly line in China, the latest sign that it has a lock on the key aviation market over rival Boeing.

The announcement came as part of a state visit by French President Emmanuel Macron to China. The signing of the agreement by Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury was witnessed by Chinese President Xi Jinping and by Macron.

It will add another line to the final-assembly facility that Airbus opened in Tianjin, China, in 2008, which has put the final touches on 600 A320 aircraft to date.

Airbus (EADSF) operates four assembly sites around the world but it forecasts that China’s air traffic in particular will grow 5.3% annually over the next 20 years, significantly faster than the world average of 3.6%.

This will lead to a demand for 8,420 passenger and freighter aircraft between now and 2041, representing more than 20% of the world’s total demand for new aircraft, Airbus predicts.

Boeing (BA) has similar forecasts for China’s aircraft demand.

Soured trade relations

But worsening trade relations between the United States and China have basically locked Boeing out of that key market for aircraft. Thursday’s deal includes the sale of another 160 Airbus aircraft to China, where more than 2,100 are in service already.

Boeing has not reported an order for a commercial passenger plane from a Chinese airline since 2017, only for orders from Chinese aircraft leasing companies that could be buying them on behalf of buyers outside of China, or for freighter aircraft, a segment of the market that Boeing dominates.

And deliveries to Chinese customers by Boeing have plunged. So far this year it has delivered only one 777 freighter to China Air Cargo, and there were only 12 jets delivered in 2022: eight freighters and four to a leasing company.

In 2017, the year the Trump administration first levied tariffs on US imports of Chinese goods, sparking a tit-for-tat trade tiff, Boeing delivered 161 jets to China, and slightly more in the following year. But with the 737 Max grounding and the pandemic causing a sharp fall off in demand for air travel, Boeing deliveries to China plunged to 45 in 2019, and to 27 in the three-plus years since then.

Boeing’s best selling plane, the 737 Max, which is a competitor to the A320 family that Airbus is finishing in China, has had trouble re-entering the Chinese market following a 20-month grounding that started in March of 2019 following two fatal crashes that killed a total of 346 people.

China was one of the last countries to allow the plane to fly in its airspace once again, and, even with that clearance, none of the Chinese customers of the plane have accepted deliveries of the 138 Boeing built for them during the grounding that are still sitting in the aircraft maker’s inventory. Boeing has been forced to try to find other buyers for some of those aircraft at discounted prices.

The 737 Max has been losing the competition with the A320 family outside of China as well, but it’s not the total shutout that Boeing is experiencing in China.

Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun has said all Boeing can do is wait and hope for relations between the two countries to improve so it can again start making substantial sales and deliveries in China.

“My hope is that these two big geopolitical forces get together and endorse free trade again … so that they can take more deliveries of airplanes,” Calhoun told investors in October.

“But it’s really hard for me to find signals that things are going to change in China and move in our direction,” he added.

The multi-purpose orbital module called Loop features three customizable decks that are connected via a tunnel surrounded by an integrated greenhouse. The orbital habitat is designed for a four-person crew but could be adjusted to accommodate up to eight spacefarers, Airbus said in a statement .

At 26 feet wide (8 meters), LOOP is designed to fit into the fairing of the upcoming generation of superheavy launchers, such as SpaceX 's Starship , and could thus be deployed with one launch and be habitable immediately after reaching orbit, Airbus said.

In its basic configuration, LOOP features a habitation deck, a science deck and a centrifuge deck producing artificial gravity , where inhabitants could receive temporary relief from zero-gravity conditions. It is well known that the human body quickly deteriorates in the absence of gravity , with muscles and bones wasting away from disuse. The absence of gravity also confuses the human nervous system and spatial orientation, which frequently leads to queasiness during the first days of an orbital stay.

""The Airbus LOOP is designed to make long-term stays in space comfortable and enjoyable for its inhabitants, while supporting efficient and sustainable operations at the same time,"" Airbus said in the statement. ""It builds on everything that has been learnt over the decades and fully exploits the potential of tomorrow’s technologies in order to best support humanity’s future in space: in low-Earth or lunar orbit, or on long-term missions to Mars .""

Airbus to Double Production in China as It Moves Ahead With New Orders (Published 2023) - The New York Times,"Thu, 06 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDQvMDYvYnVzaW5lc3MvYWlyYnVzLWNoaW5hLWRvdWJsZS1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Airbus agreed on Thursday to build a second assembly line at its factory in China and was given a green light by Beijing to move ahead with 160 previously announced plane orders. The announcement was a pointed reminder of how China remains a critical market for European companies, even as American manufacturers are pulling up stakes.

The agreement was signed in Beijing by Airbus’s chief executive, Guillaume Faury, who was part of an economic delegation accompanying President Emmanuel Macron of France and President Ursula von der Leyen of the European Union on an ambitious state visit with China’s top leader, Xi Jinping.

Airbus is working to expand production of its best-selling A320 single-aisle jet, and bolster sales in China, whose leaders have taken pains recently to try to show the world that the country is open for business after it doubled down on pandemic lockdowns last year. Under the deal, the world’s largest plane maker will double production capacity of the A320 at its factory in Tianjin, in an aviation market that is the fastest growing in the world.

And after trumpeting a major agreement last year in which China promised to buy 292 new Airbus aircraft, worth nearly $40 billion before discounts, the company said the Chinese government on Thursday gave approval for Airbus to start making 160 of those planes."

Analysis: How Did Airbus Become Dominant In China? - Aviation Week,"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy1zdXBwbHktY2hhaW4vYW5hbHlzaXMtaG93LWRpZC1haXJidXMtYmVjb21lLWRvbWluYW50LWNoaW5h0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French President Emmanuel Macron was afforded the red-carpet treatment during his visit to China in early April.

Macron’s visit highlighted another ongoing deterioration in the China-US relationship beyond political tensions over trade imbalances, spying, Taiwan and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In the first decade of this century, Boeing was the dominant supplier of airliners to China—and was still the market leader in 2019. But since then, Airbus has grown its share in the Chinese market from around 10%-15% to the point to where it is now the largest supplier. By the end of the 2023 first quarter, the Airbus in-service fleet in China had risen to over 2,100 aircraft, representing more than 50% of the market.

Airbus forecasts that over the next 20 years, China’s air traffic will grow at 5.3% annually, leading to a demand for 8,420 new passenger and freighter aircraft between now and 2041, and representing more than 20% of the world’s total demand. If current trends continue, Airbus will win the majority of that demand at Boeing’s expense.

And indeed, there was a payoff for Airbus during Macron’s visit to China, where Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury signed agreements for 160 aircraft for Chinese airlines and the addition of a second A320 family final assembly line (FAL) in Tianjin.

The reversal of fortunes for Airbus and Boeing in China could be attributed to geopolitical fallout. Certainly, Beijing can use its leverage to steer aircraft orders to Airbus, Chinese manufacturer COMAC or Brazilian supplier Embraer and there’s little Boeing can do about that.

But Boeing’s shrinking market share in China isn’t all about politics. It also has something to do with different manufacturing strategies. Airbus’ first FAL in Tianjin began operating in 2008 and has seen more than 600 A320s roll off the line since then. In March, the first Chinese-assembled A321neo was delivered.

Airbus’ multiple FAL strategy—there are also sites in Toulouse, France; Hamburg, Germany; and Mobile, Alabama—has been advantageous in helping meet demand and increase production rates for the popular narrowbody. The second FAL in Tianjin, along with a second FAL that Airbus intends to open in Toulouse, will significantly help the manufacturer meet its stated goal of producing 75 aircraft per month in 2026. As a practicality, having multiple lines is a production advantage over Boeing.

But having “local” FALs in a high-tech industry is also a competitive card the Airbus sales team can play in large markets outside its European home base. The effect in the US is not as large or obvious as in China, but Airbus enjoys strong support from lawmakers and authorities in Alabama and it doesn’t hurt for airlines like American, Delta, Frontier, JetBlue or Spirit to claim “made in America” on their narrowbodies that roll off the Mobile line.

In China, the FAL strategy has worked spectacularly for growing orders, especially with narrowbodies. Between 2000 and 2009, Airbus delivered 60 to 65 aircraft a year to China, according to Sash Tusa, an analyst and partner at Agency Partners. Now, he points out, deliveries average 160 a year.

“That gain in market share has been entirely at Boeing’s loss. Airbus has gone from, let’s say, 15% to over 50% and still rising. Boeing has gone from market dominance to second stroke, third position, depending on quite how bad a year we’ve had in the last couple years. It’s very hard to escape the conclusion that if you manufacture, if you assemble aircraft in China, you have a stronger market position than if you fly aircraft into China for delivery. … This is an industrial policy that Airbus seems to have got very right and Boeing seems to have got very wrong,” Tusa said in an Aviation Week Check 6 podcast.

Boeing does have a 737-completion center in Zhoushan, but that has not helped boost sales anything near as much as the FAL appears to have worked for Airbus, although the grounding of the MAX and its multiple design and production issues may have been contributing factors.

Having an on-location FAL isn’t a sure-fire recipe for success in China. McDonnell Douglas, before it merged with Boeing, had an MD-80 line there that failed. And Boeing has recently won a large order for 787s with Saudi government-owned Saudia and new national carrier Riyadh Air without the need for a FAL commitment.

But the signing of the new aircraft orders and announcement of a second FAL done with ceremony in front of Macron and Xi underscored how hard it will be for Boeing to turn back the clock to its turn-of-the-century dominance in the China market.

Given their difference in FAL strategies in China, it will be interesting to see how the two manufacturers approach another emerging, large and fast-growing market: India.

France and the US each have strong relations with New Delhi that they are keen to foster. Could airliner production be part of those friendship futures?

Expanding capacity at Tianjin A320 Final Assembly Line to contribute to global rate 75

Upscaling the production and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels

Beijing, 06 April 2023 - During a French state visit to China, Airbus signed new cooperation agreements with China Aviation industry partners.

Witnessed by Chinese President Xi Jinping and French President Emmanuel Macron, Airbus CEO, Guillaume Faury signed with the Tianjin Free Trade Zone Investment Company Ltd., and Aviation Industry Corporation of China Ltd., an agreement to expand A320 Family final assembly capacity with a second line at its Tianjin site. The agreement will contribute to Airbus’ overall rate objective of 75 aircraft per month in 2026 throughout its global production network.

Currently, Airbus has four A320 Family final assembly sites worldwide: Hamburg (Germany), Toulouse (France), Mobile (USA) and Tianjin (China). The Tianjin Final Assembly Line (FAL Asia) started operation in 2008 and has assembled over 600 A320 Family aircraft to date. In March 2023 the first A321neo aircraft was delivered from the line, marking a new era of enhanced A320 Family production versatility.

In addition, Airbus also signed General Terms of Agreement (GTA) with the China Aviation Supplies Holding Company (CAS) covering the purchase of 160 Airbus commercial aircraft.The GTA comprises earlier announcements for 150 A320 Family aircraft and for 10 A350-900 widebody aircraft orders, reflecting the strong demand in all market segments by Chinese carriers.

Over the next 20 years, China’s air traffic is forecast to grow at 5.3% annually, significantly faster than the world average of 3.6%. This will lead to a demand for 8,420 passenger and freighter aircraft between now and 2041, representing more than 20 percent of the world's total demand for around 39,500 new aircraft in the next 20 years.

In line with its sustainability strategy, Airbus and the China National Aviation Fuel Group (CNAF) also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to intensify Chinese-European cooperation on the production, competitive application and common standards formulation for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF). Earlier in September 2022, Airbus and CNAF contracted to support commercial and delivery flights in China to be operated with SAF. By the end of March, 17 delivery flights and a first commercial flight were facilitated by the two partners. This new cooperation agreement aims at optimising the SAF supply chain by diversifying the sources and enhancing SAF production towards the ambition of using 10 percent SAF by 2030.

“We are honoured to continue our long-standing cooperation by supporting China’s civil aviation growth with our leading families of aircraft. It underpins the positive recovery momentum and prosperous outlook for the Chinese aviation market and the desire to grow sustainably with Airbus’ latest generation, eco-efficient aircraft,” said Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury. “Airbus values its partnership with the Chinese aviation stakeholders and we feel privileged to remain a partner of choice in shaping the future of civil aviation in China.”

Airbus entered the Chinese market nearly 40 years ago, in 1985, when an A310 was first delivered to China Eastern Airlines. By the end of the first quarter 2023, the Airbus in service fleet in China has risen to over 2,100 aircraft, representing more than 50 percent of the market.

This contract is the largest single order for the H160 on the civil and parapublic market since the helicopter was unveiled in 2015. The aircraft will be used notably for the energy sector, including offshore transportation for oil and gas platforms, wind farms and harbour piloting, as well as emergency medical services and other municipal public service missions. The companies also signed a strategic cooperation agreement related to topics such as support and services capabilities, amongst others, in order to ensure the long term success of the H160 in China.



“We are honoured GDAT has decided to bolster their all-Airbus fleet of 26 helicopters with the addition of 50 H160 helicopters. The H160 has been designed at the outset as a multi-mission helicopter and is, therefore, well suited to the multiple segments that lessors provide for,” said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters.



“This contract is a great example of the importance of economic and trade cooperation between France and China. The innovative H160 is the perfect addition to our fleet and will enable us to continue our success story on the Chinese market that began with our 21 H225 helicopters. We see a lot of potential for the H160 in China, in particular for the energy sector” said Peter Jiang, Chairman of GDAT.



GDAT is China’s leading innovative general aviation service provider specialising in helicopter sales and leasing, maintenance and modifications, as well as emergency rescue flights, and other government services. The Group is headquartered in Shanghai and has four wholly-owned subsidiaries across China as well as operating bases in Suzhou and Ningbo, and an overseas branch in London.



Designed as a multi-role helicopter capable of performing a wide range of missions, the H160 integrates Airbus’ latest technological innovations. The helicopter provides passengers with superior comfort thanks to the sound-reducing Blue Edge blades and superb external visibility that benefits both passengers and pilots. With its light maintenance plan aligned between engine and aircraft, the H160 optimises operating costs and offers a new standard in availability. The H160 is already certified to fly with as much as 50% sustainable aviation fuel and is powered by two of the latest Arrano engines from Safran Helicopter Engines that offer a 15% reduction in fuel burn.

Airbus Helicopters has been a key partner in the Chinese helicopter sector for over 50 years. Today, there are more than 300 Airbus helicopters flying over China, serving more than 90 customers.

The ESA spacecraft operations team at the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany, took control of the spacecraft and confirmed reception of the first telemetry and the smooth deployment of the solar arrays. The Airbus-built JUICE is now officially on its way to Jupiter!

Additional equipment and instruments will be progressively turned on in the next few days and the operations team will run tests to make sure they are all fully operational.

“After years of work, watching this launch live from our sites across Europe was a very emotional moment for all those who have worked on this incredible mission. This is the best of Europe coming together!” said Michael Schöllhorn, CEO Airbus Defence and Space from Kourou. “I’m eager to see the next big thing coming from the European space community.”

JUICE: a European shared success

Bringing together 80 partners across 23 countries and harnessing the brainpower of 2,000+ people, Airbus has designed and built JUICE under contract to the European Space Agency (ESA).

On its over 5 billion kilometre long journey, the 6.2 tonne JUICE spacecraft will make a series of flybys of Callisto, Ganymede and Europa, collecting data to try to understand whether there is any possibility that the moons and their subsurface oceans could host microbial life. Carrying 10 state-of-the-art scientific instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, an ice-penetrating radar, an altimeter, a radio-science experiment, a particle package and various magnetic and electric field sensors, the JUICE spacecraft will complete a unique 4-year tour of the Jupiter system.

JUICE is due to arrive at Jupiter in 2031 after a series of gravity slingshots from Venus and Earth to propel it on its way.

Airbus Helicopters introduces first American-made military versions of the H125 - Airbus,"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0wNC1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtaW50cm9kdWNlcy1maXJzdC1hbWVyaWNhbi1tYWRlLW1pbGl0YXJ5LXZlcnNpb25z0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MAG Aerospace to design and certify flexible weapons installation, allowing rapid reconfiguration

GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas, Airbus Helicopters is introducing the first U.S.-built H125 military configurations, known as AH-125 and MH-125 Ares, to the Airbus range of military helicopters. These combat-capable aircraft will feature militarized options that meet the needs of military and parapublic allies and partners around the world.

The AH-125 Ares will be configured as the armed variant of the helicopter, while the MH-125 Ares will be configured as a multi-role helicopter capable of a wide range of operations. The new offerings complement the extensive line of military helicopters already produced by Airbus, including the H125M.

“The AH-125 and MH-125 Ares helicopters will offer the capability, reliability and flexibility needed by America’s allies and partners as they perform an array of rotary wing missions, ranging from light attack to disaster response and other parapublic missions,” said Scott Tumpak, Vice President of Military Line of Business for Airbus U.S. Space and Defense. “They represent the latest evolution of Airbus’ H125 family of helicopters, and will be produced in the U.S. at Airbus Helicopters, Inc.’s facility in Columbus, Mississippi.”

Globally, the H125 family accounts for almost 80% of the single-engine market and has the highest number of certified modifications (supplemental type certificates) available. With the new addition of a flexible weapons capability, the H125 helicopter will easily be re-configured between multiple mission sets in less than 30 minutes, ranging between light attack, air assault, search and rescue, casualty evacuation, and disaster response, as well as other combat and parapublic operations.

MAG Aerospace will perform the weapons installation design, engineering, certification and manufacturing. The helicopter will accommodate a wide range of weapons such as a .50 cal (12.7 mm) gun and unguided rockets, and precision-guided weapons as a growth option. The installation allows for doors-on flight throughout the mission.

“MAG Aerospace is thrilled to team with Airbus to combine our unique platform engineering and modification capabilities with the world-class leader in the single-engine helicopter market. It’s an honor to work with Airbus and expand our ability to serve our partners in the U.S. and around the world,” said Matt Bartlett, President of MAG Aerospace.

The H125 is the world’s top-selling helicopter with a long history of use by U.S. law enforcement and government agencies. Currently, the H125 is the light enforcement helicopter used by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, with more than 100 H125 family aircraft in service, making the U.S. government the single largest customer and operator of the aircraft.

Airbus provides a range of reliable and versatile helicopters to the U.S. government and military, enabling them to perform a wide variety of missions. More than 480 UH-72A and UH-72B Lakota helicopters have been delivered to the U.S. Army and National Guard since the program began in 2006. Airbus also continues to support the U.S. Coast Guard’s fleet of nearly 100 MH-65 helicopters, which play a critical role in the USCG’s homeland security, drug interdiction and lifesaving missions.

Airbus celebrates this week the 100th A330neo delivery.

On April 7, the 100th A330neo - an A330-900 - was delivered to German airline Condor, the latest A330neo operator who ordered 16 A330neo to replace previous generation aircraft in their fleet and reduce operating costs as well as fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions.

Beyond a symbol, the 100th A330neo marks an important milestone for Airbus and its A330neo Family after the first aircraft - an A330-900 - was handed over to the Programme’s launch operator TAP Air Portugal in late 2018.

An aircraft of choice for operators

Since its entry into service, the A330neo has been able to become an aircraft of choice for operators who consider business sustainability and operational reliability as key elements of their growth strategy.

“The A330neo offers both high flexibility - from regional to long-haul flights - and efficiency - with 25% less fuel burn and CO 2 emissions compared to previous generation competitor aircraft. It’s not only the natural successor of the A330ceo, it’s also the first large airliner to be certified by *EASA for *ICAO’s post-2028 environmental regulations. This demonstrates the proven maturity of the A330neo to meet CO 2 emissions requirements beyond 2028 and will help many airlines in the future to reach their environmental targets” says Alexis Vidal, VP Marketing Airbus widebody aircraft.

This is already a natural transition for many airlines such as the Asian carrier Malaysia Airlines, who placed an order of 20 A330neo to replace its A330ceo fleet and meet its decarbonisation objectives.

To date, the A330neo Family flies in the liveries of 22 airlines on over 200 routes and destinations worldwide.

In addition, the A330neo has been able to unlock both transatlantic and regional routes connecting around 20 millions passengers across the world. Benefiting from the widebody A350 technologies, the A330neo also incorporates the Airspace™ cabin ensuring the highest level of comfort. This includes providing more personal space, larger overhead bins, a new mood lighting system and the latest in-flight entertainment systems and full connectivity. Airlines such as Virgin Atlantic and Delta Air Lines have always been focused on the passenger experience, and the A330neo Airspace cabin fits perfectly with that philosophy by offering superior comfort to passengers.

Meeting the growing demand

With an order book that has significantly increased in the two previous years, the A330neo is solidifying its reputation as an aircraft of choice for airlines that can be delivered in the short term while supporting airlines’ growth strategy in the long term. For 2022 only, Airbus delivered 23 A330neo to 8 customers and registered 19 orders from 5 customers including 4 new operators.

This expansion will allow Airbus to increase the A330neo production rates to 4 aircraft per month by 2024 and meet the current increasing demand for the A330neo. Airbus *GMF22forecasts a demand estimated to represent 7,870 typically widebody over the next 20 years, namely due to the current acceleration in aging aircraft fleet replacement needs.

With this new milestone, the A330neo confirms its breakthrough on the widebody market, flying towards a promising future.

In the coming decade, we want to set up the future production tool for the next generation of aircraft, one of the big decision factors being the capacity to produce at strong rates

Pierre Magnin, head of the Engineering Research and Technology department at Airbus Atlantic.

“We are thus led to establish comparisons among all the technological solutions at our disposal. And at this stage no technology can be dismissed. For a metallic aircraft, there still is room for progress thanks to new manufacturing technologies and this solution offers benefits in terms of cost and recyclability. We also have the composite thermosetting technology, widely implemented on the A350, which is constantly improving, the ultimate challenge being components made of thermoplastic materials. Depending on the maturity of one technology or another, we could very well have mixed solutions, using both thermoplastic and thermoset parts"".

In our composites facilities in Méaulte, Nantes and Salaunes (France), we manufacture a wide range of thermoset and thermoplastic aircraft fuselage parts and aerospace equipment, using cutting-edge composite technologies:

Equipped aircraft sections and work-packages (nose fuselage section and centre wing box for the A350, aft fuselage panels for the A220, equipped wings for ATR);

Large complex parts for all type of aircraft (radomes, air inlets, wing flaps, keel beams, seat shells…) as well as elementary parts (stringers, struts…);

Cockpit furnishing (for A320, A400M);

Cabin furnishing: window panels, bins, lavatories, ceiling, partitions… (ATR 42 / 72)

Premium passenger seat shells (for all types of aircraft).

We use various technologies such as Automated Fibre Placement (AFP), Automated Tape Laying (ATL), Infusion / Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM), compression moulding, filament winding, hand lay-up, Out of Autoclave process (OoA), robotized fibre placement, dry fibre.

In our three research centres (Airbus Atlantic Technocentre in Nantes, Atlantic Lab in Méaulte and Stelia Composites Expertise Centre in Salaunes), our engineers develop large, one-part, fastener free, 3D primary structures, manufactured by infusion or by non-autoclave welding and thermoplastic technologies. We also investigate innovative assembly processes based on advanced robotic solutions.

At JEC World 2023, from 25 to 27 April, Airbus Atlantic showcased 2 demonstrators for the aircraft of the future:

A new generation of composite rear fuselage panels for the A220 : manufactured in Salaunes site, these new-generation panels made of high-performance carbon fibre and thermoset prepreg resin enable significant weight reduction, better resistance to corrosion and increase the interval between inspections.

An innovative radome manufactured by an automated process: radomes are exclusively made of non-metallic materials, to meet dielectric and radiofrequency constraints. Developed in Nantes site, the very first mock-up of a radome manufactured thanks to an automated composite fibre lay-up process, involving a change in design, significantly improves industrial performance."

Airbus' A350 freighter comes to life as the first parts are produced - Airbus Aircraft,"Tue, 04 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vYWlyY3JhZnQuYWlyYnVzLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzcm9vbS9zdG9yaWVzLzIwMjMtMDQtYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtZnJlaWdodGVyLWNvbWVzLXRvLWxpZmUtYXMtdGhlLWZpcnN0LXBhcnRzLWFyZS1wcm9kdWNlZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In early 2023 the A350F programme continued to steadily enlarge its customer base, standing at time of writing / by end of the first quarter at 35 aircraft from seven operators. In parallel with these latest commercial achievements on the world stage, ‘behind the scenes’ the aircraft’s development has been progressing apace, as the first parts of the world’s newest and most efficient large freighter are taking shape.

This means that the aircraft is coming to reality in just under 1.5 years after the new freighter was officially unveiled to the industry. It is also further testimony that Airbus is progressing well on its commitment to provide airlines and the cargo industry with a unique choice via this all-new technology widebody freighter.

First parts for A350F Centre Wing Box produced at Airbus Atlantic

At the time of writing the first metal-cuts for the A350F had just taken place in Nantes with the machining of the first parts for the Centre Wing Box (CWB). These parts include the “vertical cruciform” – the massive fitting that joins the outer-wing boxes to the CWB.

Photo of A350F Vertical Cruciform manufacture

The teams in Nantes have also produced the first “external foot frames,” which join the CWB to the lateral fuselage shells. Notably, the latter are modified on the A350F to support the loads from the freighter’s main-deck floor.

The CWB and its associated parts are being produced by Airbus Atlantic – Airbus’ new aerostructures company formed in January 2022 by the amalgamation of STELIA Aerospace and the Airbus factories at Nantes and Montoir-de-Bretagne (formerly known as the “Saint-Nazaire” site). While Airbus Atlantic is already producing CWBs for the passenger A350s, the CWB for the A350F features reinforced floor beams to support the heaviest pallets and containers which the A350F will transport – being at the very middle of the aircraft. When complete, the CWB will measure 6.5m long by 5.5m wide by 3.9 metres tall.

CWB design reinforced for freighter operations

Traditionally, the first parts produced for a new aircraft or new variant are for the CWB. On all versions of the A350 this component is largely common and made from carbon fibre. The main CWB design changes for the freighter are the reinforcements required for the increased main deck floor loads linked to its cargo operations. These changes affect the internal CWB composite struts and the metallic (aluminium-lithium) structure on top of the upper composite CWB cover which supports the floor.

Adapted CWB manufacturing and sub-assembly stations in Nantes

In terms of the manufacturing and sub-assembly operations at Nantes, 15 working stations out of the 38 at the factory have been adapted to cater for the new freighter variant’s CWB, allowing production to be intermixed flexibly, ie. together with the CWBs for the A350-900 and -1000 models.

Next steps

Once the large CWB subassembly is ready for delivery in the coming months, it will be loaded on to a special transport jig and depart Nantes by road to reach Airbus Atlantic’s factory at Montoir-de-Bretagne. There it will be installed into the first A350F’s centre fuselage (both the centre and front fuselages of all A350s are assembled and equipped here). The resulting “major-component-assemblies” (MCAs) will subsequently be flown by Beluga from the adjacent Saint-Nazaire-Montoir Airport, directly to Airbus' A350 Final Assembly Line (FAL) in Toulouse.

When it enters service in 2025, the A350F will carry a payload of up to 109 tonnes over a range of 4,700nm. As a new member of the A350 Family, this freighter variant benefits from state-of-the-art technologies, aerodynamics and unrivalled operational flexibility and reliability. At the time of writing, the A350F had received 35 orders, comprising: four aircraft from CMA-CGM; seven aircraft from Air Lease Corporation; seven aircraft from Singapore Airlines; four from Air France; two from Silk Way West Airlines; seven from Etihad Airways; and four from Martinair."
Loft Orbital orders 15 more buses from Airbus OneWeb Satellites - SpaceNews,"Thu, 06 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9sb2Z0LW9yYml0YWwtb3JkZXJzLTE1LW1vcmUtYnVzZXMtZnJvbS1haXJidXMtb25ld2ViLXNhdGVsbGl0ZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Loft Orbital has ordered an additional 15 satellite buses from Airbus OneWeb Satellites to meet growing demand for its standardized space platforms.

Loft Orbital said April 6 that it ordered the buses, which it calls Longbow, from Airbus OneWeb Satellites, the joint venture of Airbus Defence and Space and OneWeb. The satellites will be produced at the Airbus OneWeb Satellites facility in Florida adjacent to the Kennedy Space Center.

The Longbow bus is based on the design of the bus used for OneWeb satellites. “We made a number of modifications to that platform to be able to accommodate a number of higher resolution, higher stability optical missions, and be able to have a longer lifetime,” said Pierre-Damien Vaujour, chief executive of Loft Orbital, in an interview. That design, he noted, is different from the Arrow bus that Airbus markets and is produced at the same factory.

Loft Orbital ordered more than 15 of the same Longbow buses from Airbus OneWeb Satellites in January 2022. He said the semi-automated production line at that Florida factory enables those satellites to be produced in large numbers quickly to support customers planning larger constellations.

Loft Orbital has previously ordered satellites from LeoStella as well as Raytheon and another company that Vaujour declined to disclose. He said the company will continue to work with multiple satellite bus suppliers rather than pursue economies of scale by consolidating orders with a single supplier.

“We’ve been very fortunate to work with Airbus. We see them as a true partner,” he said. “We also intend to order from others in the future.”

That fits into the company’s approach of providing an “abstraction layer” for customers, handling the technical details of both the space and ground segment. “We can fly any payloads on any satellite bus using any ground segment network deployed on any cloud,” he said. “This is important when you have either technical needs that are better addressed by one satellite than another or when there are non-technical needs” such as regulatory of geopolitical issues.

The company is seeing strong interest in that approach. Vaujour said he thought the initial order of more than 15 Longbow buses would last “quite a long time” but those were sold out in six months. That includes a contract with EarthDaily Analytics in January 2022 to build and operate a 10-satellite Earth observation constellation, which is the largest single deal Loft has announced to date.

The demand is coming from a variety of customers, such as government agencies, traditional space companies and startups. Those customers, he said, want data from their payloads but won’t want to deal with all the technical details of building and operating satellites. “That’s why we brand Loft as an infrastructure company, because what we do is let customers focus on deploying their mission in space.”

That approach requires Loft to maintain an inventory of satellite buses and components, which has allowed it to avoid delays because of supply chain issues endemic in the space industry today. “We ordered parts way before we have customers,” he said. “We’re seeing the same issues, but the main difference is for us suppliers are not on the critical path.”

Loft Orbital now has more than 150 employees, Vaujour said, and has been expanding facilities to be able to produce more satellites. The company raised $140 million in late 2021, which he said is sufficient to meet its current plans. “We’ve been fortunate to hire exceptional people. We have all the capital we need. We have the customers. It’s really just about executing now.”"
Air France and Airbus acquitted in trial over 2009 plane crash - CNN,"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNC8xNy9idXNpbmVzcy9haXItZnJhbmNlLWFpcmJ1cy1jcmFzaC10cmlhbC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFJaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMy8wNC8xNy9idXNpbmVzcy9haXItZnJhbmNlLWFpcmJ1cy1jcmFzaC10cmlhbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris CNN —

Air France and Airbus have been found not guilty of involuntary homicide in a criminal trial over the 2009 crash of a flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris that killed 228 passengers and crew.

The national carrier and plane manufacturing giant had been charged over their alleged role in the disaster after a previous investigation was dropped in 2019.

“Looking at the science at the time, no criminal liability seems to me to be applicable,” one of the magistrates said, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV.

The acquittal was confirmed in an abstract of the court’s ruling provided by the Paris prosecutor’s office.

State prosecutors had taken the unusual step of admitting to the court that it was “impossible” to pin the blame on either company, BFMTV reported.

“That is the part of the decision that we cannot — we do not — know how to be satisfied by, because nothing in our world, in our age, can justify that 228 people took a flight leaving Rio for Paris and never landed,” David Koubbi, a lawyer representing some of the families of victims of the crash, told BFMTV.

However, the court did find certain Airbus or Air France practices to be reckless or negligent. One issue is that Airbus did not replace faulty devices called pitot tubes, sensors crucial to determining an aircraft’s speed and altitude. Problems with pitot tubes had affected Airbus aircraft in the past.

Air France, for its part, did not properly flag past reports of incidents with these tubes to pilots, according to the court.

Both companies are now liable for civil damages as a result. A subsequent hearing has been set for September 4.

Koubbi said these are not the claims for which his clients wanted compensation.

The 2009 crash

Mystery initially surrounded the crash of Air France flight 447, an A330, in part because it occurred while the plane was flying over the Atlantic Ocean. Most fatal aircraft accidents happen close to take-off or landing, not mid-flight.

France’s Bureau d’Enquêtes et d’Analyses (BEA) concluded in 2012 that problems were first caused by icing on the pitot tubes. Once these sensors failed, the autopilot disengaged and the cockpit crew lost reliable readouts of flight data. The plane then plunged.

Airbus retrofitted pitot tubes on aircrafts in 2019 following a directive from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency.

Had they been convicted, the companies would have each faced a fine of €225,000 ($245,629).

In a statement, Airbus said it “reaffirms the full commitment of the company and all its employees to keep prioritizing a safety-first culture across the company and the aviation sector.”

An Air France spokesperson said the company “wishes to reaffirm its continued trust in all of its pilots and flight crews and reiterates that the safety of its customers and crews is its absolute priority.”

Airbus has three other A320 family final assembly sites worldwide: Hamburg, Germany; Toulouse, France; and Mobile, US.

double the capacity at its A320 family assembly plant in Tianjin

At the start of April on the sidelines of a meeting between President Xi Jinping and Macron, Airbus said it would double the capacity at its A320 family assembly plant in Tianjin and strengthen access to the world’s second-largest aviation market as domestic travel in China nears a return to pre-pandemic levels.

Airbus doubled down on its investment in China during a state visit by French President Emmanuel Macron, as the European aerospace firm seeks to widen its lead over rival Boeing in the critical aviation market.

The announcements came amid worsening trade relations between China and the US that have essentially locked American aerospace manufacturer Boeing out of the world’s second-largest economy.

How important is China for Airbus?

Airbus expects huge growth in the Chinese aviation market in the next 20 years. The European aerospace firm predicts that China’s air traffic will grow by 5.3 per cent annually, significantly faster than the world average of 3.6 per cent.

This will lead to a demand for 8,420 passenger and freighter aircraft by 2041, representing more than 20 per cent of the world’s total demand for around 39,500 new aircraft in the next 20 years.

Boeing has expressed a similar level of optimism, expecting China will require 8,485 new planes to serve passengers and trade until 2041.

What is Airbus’ presence in China?

Airbus counts China as a “strategic partner” and a key customer for its passenger jets and helicopters having first established an official presence in China in 1994.

Since 2008, Airbus has been assembling its narrow-body A320-family planes in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin.

It will now build a second assembly line at the Tianjin plant, which has so far assembled over 600 A320 family aircraft, according to Airbus. It launched its China research center on Friday in Suzhou to conduct research in manufacturing innovation, hydrogen infrastructure, passenger experience and new technologies.

In March, Airbus delivered the first A321neo aircraft from the Tianjin assembly line.

In 2017, Airbus established a completion and delivery centre for the A330 in Tianjin, marking Airbus’ first widebody aircraft centre outside Europe.

Airbus has facilities in eight different locations in China for its helicopter-related activities, including a regional customer service centre and logistics platform at Hong Kong International Airport and a H135 final assembly line in Qingdao, Shandong province.

Airbus also has a 5 per cent stake in AviChina, a Hong Kong listed helicopter and regional aircraft maker which is owned by majority shareholder, the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (Avic).

Last year, Airbus and Tarmac Aerosave signed a memorandum of understanding with the city of Chengdu, the capital of southwestern Sichuan province, to develop a service centre to cover parking, storage, maintenance, upgrades, conversions, dismantling and recycling services for various types of planes.

Airbus has more than 1,900 employees working in China.

By the end of the first quarter in 2023, the Airbus in service fleet in China had risen to over 2,100 aircraft, representing more than 50 per cent of the market, it said.

How does Airbus’ China business compare to Boeing?

Boeing has been competing with Airbus in China, but over the past few years, the US aerospace giant has struggled to sell its passenger jets amid deteriorating relations between Beijing and Washington, while Airbus has been gaining new orders.

Boeing’s 737 MAX had been grounded in China for nearly four years following two deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia and only just returned to service this year.

The US plane maker said in a social media post on its official WeChat account in April that the number of 737 MAX returning to commercial service had reached 43, accounting for around 45 per cent of the Chinese 737 MAX fleet.

Like Airbus, Boeing sees China as a critical market, employing more than 2,200 people within its subsidiaries and joint ventures.

Boeing’s investment in China contributes around US$1.5 billion annually to China’s economy, Boeing said, having delivered more than 2,000 aeroplanes to Chinese airlines and leasing companies, making China the biggest civil aviation market outside the US.

However, Boeing only began to deliver its 737 out of its assembly line in Zhoushan, a joint venture with China’s Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) in 2018, nearly a decade after Airbus.

Boeing also has a joint venture with Avic in Tianjin to produce aerospace composite parts and assemblies, including primary structures, secondary structures and interior components for its passenger jets.

What have been the big changes affecting aviation trade?

Aviation trade has been increasingly influenced by bilateral relations over the past few years.

Washington has grown wary of Beijing’s civil military fusion strategy, which aims to ensure military and economic development advances in lockstep with scientific and technological innovation.

Many aviation products are known to be dual use – meaning they have both commercial and military applications – and are therefore subject to US exports controls.

In 2021, Avic and some of its subsidiaries were identified as military end users by the US government, and American investors were banned from investing.

Avic was an active investor in the US aviation sector and formed a number of joint ventures with US companies, such as GE Aviation.

Europe currently does not have similar regulations against Avic or its subordinate companies.

However, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai has said the US plans to cooperate with the European Union on confronting China’s “non-market” practices in the aerospace industry.

In 2021, the US and the European Union agreed to a truce in their near 17-year conflict over aircraft subsidies to Boeing and Airbus, a move that was seen as a joint effort to target China as it seeks to carve out a share in the global commercial aircraft market.

What is the outlook for Airbus in China?

While Airbus appears to have an edge over Boeing when it comes to growing its business in China, it is likely to face competition from China’s home-grown C919.

The narrow-body passenger jet made by Comac is designed to compete with both Boeing’s 737 and Airbus’ A320.

The C919 received certification last year and is expected to go into commercial service in 2023.

China has made clear it wants to reduce reliance on imports and has invested heavily to develop its capability to manufacture commercial jets as well as engines."
"Airbus, Air France acquitted of manslaughter charges in trial over 2009 Rio-Paris crash - FRANCE 24 English","Mon, 17 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi9mcmFuY2UvMjAyMzA0MTctZnJlbmNoLWNvdXJ0LWFjcXVpdHMtYWlyLWZyYW5jZS1haXJidXMtb3Zlci0yMDA5LXJpby1wYXJpcy1jcmFzaNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air France and plane manufacturer Airbus were acquitted Monday over the 2009 crash of a Rio-Paris flight after a French court ruled their errors could not be proven as the disaster's cause.

While the ruling was expected after prosecutors recommended to the Paris court not to seek a conviction, it is still a huge blow for families of victims who have waged a 14-year campaign for justice.

The two France-based companies went on trial in October to determine their responsibility for the worst aviation disaster in Air France's history, which left all 228 people on board flight AF447 dead.

>> Air France, Airbus face trial in Paris over fatal 2009 Rio-Paris crash

Prosecutors said as hearings in the eight-week trial wound up in December it was ""impossible"" to convict the two aviation giants, which were charged with involuntary manslaughter but deny the charges.

If convicted, the two companies would have risked a fine of 225,000 euros ($250,000) as well as significant reputational damage.

As the verdict was read out, relatives of the victims present in court stood up, appearing stunned, then sat down again.

""We expected an impartial judgement, this was not the case. We are disgusted,"" said Daniele Lamy, president of the association which represents the victims.

""All that remains of these 14 years of waiting is despair, dismay and anger,"" she added.

Alain Jakubowicz, one of their lawyers, added: ""We are told: 'responsible but not guilty'. And it is true that we were waiting for the word 'guilty'.""

'Imprudence'

The hearings in Paris centred on the role of defective so-called Pitot tubes, which are used to measure the flight speed of aircraft.

The court heard how a malfunction with the tubes, which became blocked with ice crystals during a mid-Atlantic storm, caused alarms to sound in the cockpit of the Airbus A330 and the autopilot system to switch off.

Technical experts highlighted how, after the instrument failure, the pilots put the plane into a climb that caused the aircraft to lose upward lift from the air moving under its wings, thus losing altitude.

Air France and Airbus have blamed pilot error as the main cause for the crash.

But lawyers for the families have argued that both companies were aware of the Pitot tube problem before the crash, and that the pilots were not trained to deal with such a high-altitude emergency.

The court said Airbus committed ""four acts of imprudence or negligence"", including not replacing certain models of the Pitot tubes that seemed to freeze more often on its A330-A340 fleet, and ""withholding information"" from flight operators.

It said Air France had committed two ""acts of imprudence"" in the way it disseminated an information note on the faulty tubes to its pilots.

But there was not a strong enough causal link between these failings and the accident to show an offence had been committed.

'Legally justified'

Prosecutors initially dropped charges against the companies in 2019 in a decision that also infuriated victims' families.

A Paris appeals court overturned this decision in 2021 and ordered the trial to go ahead.

Throughout the trial, representatives of Airbus and Air France maintained the companies were not guilty of criminal wrongdoing.

Their lawyers demanded acquittal, describing this as a ""difficult decision from a human point of view, but technically and legally justified"".

Air France ""takes note of the judgement"", the company said in a statement after the verdict.

""The company will always remember the memory of the victims of this terrible accident and expresses its deepest sympathy to all of their loved ones.""

Airbus said that this decision was ""consistent"" with the dismissal pronounced at the end of the investigation in 2019. The group also expressed its ""compassion"" to the relatives of the victims, and ""reaffirms (its) total commitment... in terms of aviation safety"".

Airbus trailed, at 127 deliveries to Boeing’s 130, in the first three months of the year, a year-on-year reversal of fortunes after Boeing’s dismal Q1 22 performance of just 95 deliveries to Airbus’s 142.

Pressure has been mounting on Boeing after it reported losses of $5bn last year, on the back of a host of quality control issues. Encouragingly, however, deliveries of the 737 increased to 113 in Q1 23, versus just 86 in Q1 22.

Meanwhile, in Q1 there were 11 deliveries of the troubled B787 Dreamliner, before they stopped again in late February due to issues with the forward pressure bulkhead. Production had halted over the same quarter last year, following the FAA putting a stop to new deliveries in mid-2021.

But this year has seen the first delivery of a B767-300 freighter, which experienced technical difficulties. The Loadstar previously reported that three Maersk 767-300Fs had been grounded for safety reasons.

The problem was later revealed to be issues with a fuel tank coating that was peeling off and blocking the aircraft’s fuel filter, threatening to cut fuel supply. The problem has dogged 767s since the coatings supplier was switched last year.

To date, FedEx Express has taken delivery of one 767-300F and has another 26 on order, while 27 are still to be delivered for rival UPS. Other freighter deliveries include four 777Fs to companies in China.

Airbus, meanwhile, confirmed yesterday that deliveries of its A350 jets were at just five by the end of March, whereas, according to the company, some 14 had been delivered by this point last year. Some 440 A350s remain on order.

“Hopes of achieving deliveries in the high 130s in the first quarter were hit by continuing industrial and supply chain problems that have most recently spread to premium widebody cabins,” Reuters reported.

Recent airworthiness directives for Airbus aircraft from the European Aviation Safety Agency point to flaws in procurement and build quality “which threaten catastrophic results if left unchecked”. In March alone, these included incomplete production processes on A330 parts, as well as cracks reported in aluminium forged parts on A350s.

Bucking a trend set by other European businesses at the beginning of this year, Airbus is doubling its capacity in China in response to its now-swelling backlog, bringing production to around eight aircraft a month, with the goal of increasing deliveries this year to 720.

Airbus spokesperson Stefan Schaffrath told The Loadstar: “A slow January is not unusual, and we are still catching up with the aircraft we missed in January. But the deliveries in March are above expectations, with 61 deliveries. One quarter does not make the full year. The trend is shifting, and we are building on this trajectory.”"

Airbus announced on Thursday it signed a 160 commercial aircraft purchase agreement with a Chinese partner, and it will open a second assembly line in Tianjin, further expanding its presence in one of the largest aviation markets in the world.The package deal is made as French President Emmanuel Macron made a state visit to China. Macron's visit is the first time a European leader visited China after China fully reopened exchanges with other countries.The deal was done with the China Aviation Supplies Holding Co, for 150 A320 Family aircraft and 10 A350-900 widebody aircraft, reflecting the strong demand in all market segments from Chinese carriers.In addition, Airbus will build a second assembly line at its Tianjin site to double its output. The agreement will contribute to Airbus' overall rate objective of 75 aircraft per month in 2026 throughout its global production network.This new cooperation agreement also aims at optimizing the Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) supply chain by diversifying the sources and enhancing SAF production toward the ambition of using 10 percent SAF by 2030, Airbus said.The deals show our confidence in China's investment environment, as the Chinese aviation industry will continue to grow, said Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury during an interview on Thursday.Setting up the second assembly line in Tianjin means that 20 percent of single-aisle aircraft worldwide will be assembled in Tianjin. Upon completion at the end of 2025, there will be 10 assembly lines in the world, which will better help the production pace reach 75 aircraft per month in 2026, he said.China now accounts for 20 percent of the annual deliveries by Airbus in the world. Airbus has produced 600 single-aisle aircraft in Tianjin and there are about 2,100 Airbus aircraft in China, which means that about 30 percent of the Airbus aircraft flying in China were manufactured in China.

When Airbus proposed the idea of building the first assembly line in Tianjin in 2005, the market share for Airbus in China was less than 20 percent, but the ratio increased to 50 percent within 10 years. ""The resolution is the localization,"" said George Xu, CEO of Airbus China.When asked to comment on increasing calls for decoupling between China and Europe, Faury said the aviation industry is an international industry, and Airbus is also an international company.""We need a global industrial chain, and we also rely on global businesses. High globalization is the characteristic of the aviation industry,"" Faury said.Macron also said ""we mustn't decouple with China.""""There's a rivalry with the European Union that we fully acknowledge, but we also know that there are major international issues that we need to work on together,"" he added, according to Bloomberg.In the past decades, Airbus has been providing Chinese customers with the most modern and comprehensive family of aircraft on the market. China has become the biggest single country market of Airbus around the world. As of the end of February 2023, the Airbus in-service fleet in the Chinese mainland reached 2,127 aircraft, for a 54 percent market share.The country is also home to a growing number of Airbus manufacturing and support operations, including its first final assembly line outside Europe, which was inaugurated in Tianjin in September 2008. This joint venture between Airbus and a Chinese consortium of the Tianjin Free Trade Zone and Aviation Industry Corp of China was extended in March 2014 until 2025.

Faury said the global aviation industry suffered in the pandemic, and the supply chain was hurt. But the lifting of travel restrictions has brought a strong recovery of the industry, which is faster than the speed of recovery of the supply chain.As a large company, one of the difficulties that Airbus faces is that it needs to go deep into every link in the supply chain to see what difficulties the specific suppliers are facing and help them find solutions so as to improve. One of our ultimate goals is to enable all suppliers to deliver their products on time, Faury said.In the past three years, Chinese airlines have received a total of 353 Airbus aircraft, which also shows the confidence that Chinese airlines have always had in the market.Three state-owned airlines - China Southern, Air China and China Eastern - in July last year announced a deal with Airbus to buy 292 aircraft valued at around $37 billion in total.It was the second time China signed such a big deal after Chinese leaders visited Europe in March 2019, when Airbus signed a deal worth tens of billions of dollars to sell 300 aircraft to China."

While it was determined that there were several negligent incidents from both companies, ""a probable causal link isn't sufficient to characterize an offense,"" the court ruled, per Reuters.

The ruling follows an intense public trial held over Air France Flight 447, an Airbus A330 that disappeared over the Atlantic Ocean on June 1, 2009, while en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris. The remains of the plane and its black box recorders were found on the ocean floor two years later.

It was determined that the crash occurred when the plane encountered a mid-ocean thunderstorm. After the plane's ""airspeed sensors froze and gave false readings, the pilots failed to follow correct procedure and lost control of the plane, which plunged into the ocean,"" BBC News reported.

A subsequent investigation by The Associated Press found that ""Airbus had known since at least 2002 about problems with the type of pitot tubes [airspeed sensors] used on the jet that crashed, but failed to replace them until after the crash."" Airbus was accused of not informing its airlines about issues with the sensors, while Air France was accused of not training its pilots on contingencies when the sensors froze, per AP.

However, following a decade of legal proceedings, the court has ruled there was not enough direct evidence against the two companies to hold them liable, a decision that was decried by the victim's families and legal counsel.

The Board mandates of Ralph D. Crosby Jr., Mark Dunkerley and Stephan Gemkow were each renewed for three years. A three-year term was also approved for Antony Wood who replaced Lord Paul Drayson on the Board last December, bringing with him extensive experience of the aerospace industry and defence sector. Lord Drayson resigned from the Board on the day of the 2022 AGM.

Airbus Board mandates are renewed at each AGM, in blocks of four for three years, in order to ensure a smooth transition and that the appropriate skills are retained among the directors. This also avoids large block replacements of directors at any single AGM.

"Airbus aims to hire 800 in U.S., including new positions in Mobile - AL.com","Tue, 11 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDQvYWlyYnVzLWFpbXMtdG8taGlyZS04MDAtaW4tdXMtaW5jbHVkaW5nLW5ldy1wb3NpdGlvbnMtaW4tbW9iaWxlLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus announced plans to hire 800 people in the U.S. in 2023, including new jobs at the Mobile site where it’s expanding assembly facilities for its popular A321 family of jetliners.

In an announcement released Tuesday, the company said that the planned U.S. hires are separate from a target of 800 hires this year in Canada. Out of the 800 U.S. jobs, more than 500 will fill new positions, the company said.

“Airbus’ story is one of continued growth in America. After recruiting more than 1,500 employees in 2022, we are maintaining our momentum and hiring at least another 800 across the country in 2023,” said C. Jeffrey Knittel, President and CEO of Airbus Americas. “We are growing a diverse and talented team of individuals dedicated to designing and building the future of sustainable aerospace.”

“Recruitment needs in the U.S. are varied,” said Tuesday’s announcement. “Roles include engineering, IT, procurement, and quality, as well as production and support team members for its A320/A220 manufacturing facilities in Mobile, Alabama, and Airbus Helicopters facilities in Texas and Mississippi among others. … Approximately two-thirds of the jobs will support the company’s rapidly expanding Commercial Aircraft production activities, with the remaining third primarily supporting Airbus Helicopters and Airbus U.S. Space & Defense.”

Airbus manufactures helicopters in Columbus, Miss. And while its Final Assembly Line for A320- and A220-family jets is by far its biggest operation in Mobile, its Space & Defense branch has a presence near Mobile Regional Airport, where it operates a maintenance, repair and overhaul facility.

Airbus has set ambitious targets for the post-pandemic ramp-up of production for its A320-family of airliners. Within a few years, it aims to produce 75 of the aircraft per month, across four facilities in Germany, France, China and the United States. In May 2022 it announced plans to build a new assembly line in Mobile, a project that could mean 1,000 new jobs for the area.

Work has begun on that project. A company representative said Tuesday that plans call for the new assembly line to begin production in the second quarter of 2025. More recently, as reported by Aviation Week, the company announced similar plans to add a second A320 assembly line to its facility in Tianjin, China, doubling production there as well.

Airbus reports that more than 4,600 people work for it in the United States. According to Tuesday’s news release, the company “will allocate one-third of its positions to young graduates and early-career professionals, and will maintain its goal to increase the number of female new hires and promotions.”

Planning for the future with DisruptiveLab - Airbus,"Fri, 07 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTA0LXBsYW5uaW5nLWZvci10aGUtZnV0dXJlLXdpdGgtZGlzcnVwdGl2ZWxhYtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Designed to test technology that will significantly reduce carbon emissions, Airbus’ DisruptiveLab concept helicopter flew for the first time in January. Tomasz Krysinski, Head of Research and Innovation at Airbus Helicopters explains the innovations inside.

Helicopters currently represent less than 1% of aviation CO2 emissions, yet to try to protect the planet for future generations, Airbus has made reducing the carbon emissions of its products an absolute priority. “At Airbus Helicopters we are committed to the IATA target of flying net zero by 2050,” states Krysinski. “This is a key driver for our innovation strategy.”

“We have a strong roadmap to meet IATA’s target, which includes different solutions: starting with the use of alternative fuels and further developing hybridisation and electrification – like the CityAirbus NextGen, our Advanced Air Mobility prototype.” However, this new age of vertical lift will not happen overnight. That’s why a key part of Airbus’ innovation strategy focuses on introducing innovations that will reduce carbon emissions.

DisruptiveLab helicopter

Testing new innovations to reduce mass and drag

In order to develop the next generation of innovations, Airbus relies on several flying laboratories as a way to quickly mature new technologies. The DisruptiveLab is a brand new demonstrator that flew for the first time on 13 January, with a totally new architecture. This latest flying laboratory will evaluate an efficient propulsion system by testing a fully parallel hybrid propulsion system that enables batteries to be recharged in-flight. Its new aerodynamic architecture is intended to reduce fuel consumption, by reducing mass and drag.

With a target of reducing carbon emissions by 50%, many an innovation will be tested and featured on the DisruptiveLab. We’re taking a look at the top five which Tomasz is most excited about:

“A helicopter’s rotor hub is responsible for roughly 40% of the drag in a flight. The DisruptiveLab’s hub includes our entire blade concept with integrated dampers, which is completely compacted. Compared to previous helicopters, it offers a reduction of 40% of drag. It is really an enormous step forward.” Whilst it might not immediately be apparent as a source of drag, the landing gear can also have an impact on aerodynamic performance. “On every helicopter, there is always a compromise between the rotor and the landing gear, due to ground resonance. Here we are testing a completely new concept, it is highly integrated and allows us to significantly reduce the drag.” The shape of the fuselage is also designed to improve efficiency. “We tested 40 configurations of the fuselage in a wind tunnel. The one we selected enables us to reduce drag by 20% compared to the previous version,” notes Krysinski. “We also simplified the tail to reduce maintenance.” The Fenestron has also been redesigned to reduce the number of mechanical parts, “it has 40% less compared to the previous version. The best mechanical part is the part you don't have – as it will never need to be maintained. This modulated Fenestron is even quieter, easier to maintain and the diameter of the hub has also been reduced. This reduces a global part of the tail, so consequently it reduces drag.” With the DisruptiveLab we will also introduce reversible hybridisation, which allows transmission of power from the turbine to the batteries and vice versa. This will allow a huge reduction of CO2 emissions."
Airbus' fuel-saving Descent Profile Optimisation function chosen by Air Canada for its A320 family and A330 fleets - Airbus Aircraft,"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2FpcmNyYWZ0LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLTA0LWFpcmJ1cy1mdWVsLXNhdmluZy1kZXNjZW50LXByb2ZpbGUtb3B0aW1pc2F0aW9uLWZ1bmN0aW9uLWNob3Nlbi1ieS1haXItY2FuYWRh0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus announced today that Canada's largest airline, Air Canada, has chosen to install its “Descent Profile Optimisation” (DPO) function on the airline’s A320 and A330 Families. The enhancement to the aircraft’s on-board Flight Management System (FMS) performance database generates fuel savings and reduces C0 2 emissions through optimisation of the aircraft’s flight trajectory during descent.

Air Canada will install the DPO solution on 48 of its A320ceo Family aircraft and 18 A330ceo aircraft.

The DPO function enables aircraft to use an optimum engine model to compute the profile of the descent, requesting less fuel when the engine is using idle thrust. It reduces fuel consumption, resulting in proportional C0 2 and NOx reductions. In addition, it maximises the time spent at efficient cruise level by setting the top of descent later in the profile. The inefficient level-off stage is reduced by the FMS during the computation of the profile, without affecting the approach speed of the final approach.

“Air Canada has committed to an ambitious goal of achieving net zero carbon neutrality by 2050. One of the measures we will use to achieve this target is through our operations by flying aircraft more efficiently to reduce fuel burn. Apart from limiting emissions, consuming less fuel also benefits the bottom line because fuel is typically one of the airline’s greatest expenses,” said Murray Strom, Senior Vice President, Flight Operations and Maintenance, Air Canada.

Air Canada, the country's flag carrier, operates a fleet of more than 125 Airbus aircraft, including 78 A320 Family aircraft, 16 A330 Family aircraft and 31 A220-300 aircraft. Air Canada also has a direct order for 10 A321XLRs. Last year, Air Canada and Airbus announced a double-digit million CAD investment in climate solutions company Carbon Engineering to help accelerate decarbonisation solutions.

“The DPO solution will help Air Canada achieve an estimated 70 tons of fuel per aircraft/per year on their A320 fleet (220 tons eq C0 2 ), and an estimated 110 tons per aircraft/per year on their A330 fleet (340 tons eq C0 2 ), enabling more efficient operations,” said Dominik Wacht, Airbus Head of Customer Services for North America. “In addition, it brings the ceo fleet up to the neo standard of operations. This is another contributor to Air Canada’s decarbonisation ambition.”

ACA DPO 2

DPO is one of the several flight operations optimisation solutions offered by Airbus. Save up to 6% of fuel thanks to our combined solutions for fuel efficiency (sharklets, CDA, SETWA, IFO, etc...). Airbus’ DPO is available on A320 family (except on A319CJ and A320LIP) and A330 family and is a software-only upgrade."

Almost 14 years after the crash that killed all 228 people on the jet, relatives of the victims said after the court's ruling that they felt justice still had not been done.

The plane plummeted into the Atlantic on June 1, 2009, after a catastrophic chain of events that lasted just four minutes and 24 seconds. There were 34 nationalities on board the transatlantic flight. Among the 216 passengers there were 126 men, 82 women, 7 children and a baby. It took two years to recover the flight data recorders, or ""black boxes"" from the seabed.

The two French giants of the aviation industry had been charged with involuntary manslaughter over the crash. They denied the charges throughout the trial, which ran from October to December 2022.

The Paris court ruled that neither company could be held responsible for the crash of the Airbus A330-200. The judges said that even if ""errors"" had been committed, ""no certain link of causality"" between those mistakes and the accident could be proven.

As the verdict was read out, many victims' relatives in court looked stunned. There were tears and some explosions of anger outside the courtroom afterward as they digested the news.

Philippe Linguet, who lost his brother Pascal in the crash and is now vice-president of the victims' group Entraide et solidarité AF447, called it ""a day of infamy, mourning, sadness and shame.""

The verdict was hardly a surprise. In December, the prosecution concluded its case by calling for an acquittal, saying the crash was mostly down to pilot error.

A lawyer for the victims' association, Alain Jakubowicz, said after the verdict was delivered however that it was clear from the evidence that it was not the pilots' fault alone.

""It's a verdict that is hard for the victims' families to understand,"" he said. ""There were errors. This accident could have been avoided. It should have been avoided.""

Ophélie Touillou lost her brother Nicolas in the crash. Speaking through tears, she said she felt the ruling was ""deeply unjust.""

""I think the law is poorly constructed, because we heard the word 'responsible' and we were told mistakes were made and not just one, at Airbus and Air France, so, for us and every one of your readers and those watching us, it's hard to understand how, today, companies can make mistakes that we're told come with a very high probability of death — that's what we're told, 'a very high probability,' and without that, it is most likely it would not have happened. Yet, they are acquitted. I'll admit that today, I find it very difficult to understand my country's judicial system.""

Atmospheric sensors on the aircraft's wings iced over during the night-time flight over the ocean. That prompted inaccurate messages to be sent to the two co-pilots who were at the controls. Unaware of the problem, their contradictory responses only aggravated the situation.

The cockpit voice recorder revealed that the two were taking conflicting actions, unaware of what the other was doing. The captain was on a sleep break and when he came back into the cockpit, he did not take over the controls but left his subordinates in charge as the situation deteriorated.

After the crash, it was revealed that Air France was aware that there had been some weather effects on the same atmospheric sensors as were on the Rio-Paris flight as early as 2001. However, the airline had not replaced them. Shortly after the crash, Airbus recommended that Air France replace the sensors on its long-haul A330 aircraft, which it began doing in August 2009.

This was France's first trial for corporate involuntary manslaughter, and the companies had faced a maximum fine of $245,680."

The agreements also include plans to “intensify Chinese-European cooperation” in the production and use of sustainable aviation fuel.

The company said the agreements, which it signed during a French state visit to China with Chinese President Xi Jinping and French President Emmanuel Macron among the witnesses, will help Airbus reach its global production goal of 75 aircraft per month during 2026.

Airbus has four final assembly facilities worldwide for the A320 family of aircraft. They are located in Hamburg, Germany; Toulouse, France; Mobile, Alabama; and Tianjin, China. The Tianjin final assembly line began operating in 2008 and has turned out more than 600 aircraft. Under the latest agreements Tianjin will receive a second line, Airbus said.

Airbus said that during the next 20 years, forecasts indicate China’s air traffic will grow at 5.3 percent annually, compared with the global average of 3.6 percent. Such growth will drive demand for 8,420 passenger and freighter aircraft, or about 20 percent of total demand for aircraft, between today and 2041.

Airbus said it also agreed to work with the China National Aviation Fuel Group “to intensify Chinese-European cooperation on the production, competitive application and common standards formulation for sustainable aviation fuels.”

Last September Airbus and CNAF worked together to facilitate 17 delivery flights and one commercial flight, the company said, adding that the new agreement is meant to optimize the SAF supply chain and move toward a goal of using 10 percent SAF by 2030.

“We are honored to continue our long-standing cooperation by supporting China’s civil aviation growth with our leading families of aircraft. It underpins the positive recovery momentum and prosperous outlook for the Chinese aviation market and the desire to grow sustainably with Airbus’ latest generation, eco-efficient aircraft,” said Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury.

Airbus said it first entered the Chinese market with its A310 airliner in 1985. By the end of this year’s first quarter, the company’s fleet in China had grown to more than 2,100 aircraft, or more than half of the market, the company said."

The type was seen wearing NK’s standard yellow livery and registration D-AVZU, which is Airbus’ test registration. The aircraft will later be reregistered to N702NK, with MSN 11328.

During today’s test flight, Airbus pilots and mechanics checked the airframe’s navigational and radio navigational systems. The route can be found on Flightradar24’s website.

The aircraft climbed to an initial cruising altitude of 31,000 feet (FL310, 9450m), then up to the A321neo’s service ceiling, 39,000 feet (FL390, 11900m). After some time spent at cruising altitude, D-AVZU started to descend and do a touch-and-go maneuver at Hamburg Airport’s (HAM) runway 05 to test the ILS approach.

The NK A321neo finally headed back to XFW airport and did a full-stop landing there.

Some erupted in sobs, others listened in stunned silence as the presiding judge read out the decision, a devastating defeat for families of the 228 victims, who fought for 13 years to see the case reach court.

The three-judge panel ruled that there wasn’t enough evidence of a direct link between decisions by the companies and the crash. The official investigation found that multiple factors contributed to the disaster, including pilot error and the icing over of external sensors called pitot tubes.

“We are sickened. The court is telling us, ‘go on, there’s not a problem here, there’s nothing to see,’” said Danièle Lamy, who lost her son Eric in the crash and heads an association for families of victims.

“For the powerful, impunity reigns. Centuries pass, and nothing changes,” she said. “The families of victims are mortified and in total disarray.”

While the court didn’t find the companies guilty of criminal wrongdoing, the judges said that Airbus and Air France held civil responsibility for the damages caused by the crash, and ordered them to compensate families of victims. It didn’t provide an overall amount, but scheduled hearings in September to work that out.

Air France has already compensated some families of those killed, who came from 33 countries. People from around the world were among the plaintiffs.

Brazilian Nelson Faria Marinho lost his son, an engineer heading to Angola on an oil exploration job when Flight 447 crashed.

“France isn’t serious. It manufactured a killer plane and they’re covering everything else up,” said Marinho, who heads an association representing 56 Brazilian families of victims.

But he said the ruling wasn’t a surprise.

“With all the accidents, all the tragedies, the first thing they do is blame the pilot, which isn’t true. I accompanied this tragedy step by step,” he said. He described the plane as “excessively automatic. It is a killer plane and they didn’t correct it.”

Unusually, even state prosecutors argued for acquittal, saying that the two-month trial didn’t produce enough proof of criminal wrongdoing by the companies.

Prosecutors laid the blame primarily on the pilots, who died in the crash. Airbus lawyers also blamed pilot error, and Air France said the full reasons for the crash will never be known.

Air France said in a statement that the company took note of the ruling, and “will always remember the victims of this terrible accident, and express deep compassion to all of their loved ones.”

Airbus and Air France had faced potential fines of up to 225,000 euros ($219,000) each if convicted of manslaughter. That would have been just a fraction of their annual revenues, but a criminal conviction for the aviation heavyweights could have hurt their reputations and reverberated through the industry.

The A330-200 plane disappeared from radar in a storm over the Atlantic Ocean on June 1, 2009, with 216 passengers and 12 crew members aboard. It took two years to find the plane and its black box recorders on the ocean floor, at depths of more than 13,000 feet (around 4,000 meters).

An Associated Press investigation at the time found that Airbus had known since at least 2002 about problems with the type of pitot tubes used on the jet that crashed, but failed to replace them until after the crash.

Air France was accused of not having implemented training in the event of icing of the pitot probes despite the risks. Airbus was accused of not doing enough to urgently inform airlines and their crews about faults with the pitots or to ensure training to mitigate the risk.

The crash led to changes in regulations for airspeed sensors and in how pilots are trained.

The trial was fraught with emotion from the start. Distraught families shouted down the CEOs of Airbus and Air France as the proceedings opened in October, crying out “Shame!” as the executives took the stand. Dozens of people who lost loved ones stormed out of the court as the trial wrapped up with the prosecutors’ surprising call for acquittal.

“Fourteen years of legal proceedings to get here. This is a lot for us to take,” Michel Mammayou, whose daughter was aboard Flight 447, said after Monday’s verdict.

Chief Operating Officer, Airbus U.S. Space & Defense

After spending a decade working for Airbus abroad, Cara Sindir came home in 2019 to launch the revamped U.S. Space & Defense company, merging European technologies with the highest American security requirements to benefit the U.S. warfighter.

Sindir’s biggest recent achievement is recruiting a talented team to work with her. She has navigated through the post-COVID workplace realities with a team of geographically dispersed and largely remote workers.

“Cara has been an incredible asset in the growth and development not only of her operations team, but for Airbus U.S. Space & Defense as a whole,” said Robert Geckle, chairman and CEO of Airbus U.S. Space & Defense, Inc. “As she shepherds the company through the execution of critical contracts, she does so with honesty and agility. Cara is a sterling example of an efficient, effective leadership style and I am proud to have her on my executive team.”

Sindir is proud to take a leadership role in building the “workplace of the future,” which to her means increased flexibility and opportunities for employees to realize their full potential in the workplace, regardless of their personal constraints.

“It’s a challenging environment as a manager because we are realizing there is no ‘one size fits all’ approach to work, as many people need the structure and interaction of the in-person environment while others thrive in independent settings,” she said. “Striking the right balance to foster success for all can be challenging and it’s one of my top priorities.”

Why Watch

In 2023, Sindir and her team are heavily focused on the rapid growth in Airbus’ Space line of business. Airbus U.S. Space & Defense designed a new satellite, the ARROW450, and they’ve experienced great interest in the new platform.

Overall, the entire Airbus U.S. Space & Defense team is focused on growth. Whether building new satellites or launching a new optical communications terminal subsidiary company, they aim to bring European technology to America and build the highest-quality products to solve the nation’s toughest challenges.

“I love being part of a team that creates opportunities for people of many different backgrounds to succeed,” Sindir said. “One of the benefits of coming from a multi-national corporate background is that I’ve been able to see first-hand how diversity truly makes a company stronger and more effective. Corporate America has come such a long way and I’m proud to help lead a team at Airbus U.S. that lives these values.”"

Air France and Airbus cleared of involuntary manslaughter over 2009 crash - The Guardian,"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDIzL2Fwci8xNy9haXItZnJhbmNlLWFuZC1haXJidXMtY2xlYXJlZC1vZi1pbnZvbHVudGFyeS1tYW5zbGF1Z2h0ZXItb3Zlci0yMDA5LWNyYXNo0gF3aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3dvcmxkLzIwMjMvYXByLzE3L2Fpci1mcmFuY2UtYW5kLWFpcmJ1cy1jbGVhcmVkLW9mLWludm9sdW50YXJ5LW1hbnNsYXVnaHRlci1vdmVyLTIwMDktY3Jhc2g?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The families of victims of France’s worst air disaster said they were devastated after a Paris court cleared Air France and Airbus of manslaughter charges over the 2009 crash that caused the deaths of 228 people.

Giving its verdict on Monday, the court said that if there had been faults committed, “no certain causal link” with the accident had been demonstrated.

David Koubbi, a lawyer for the families of a number of passengers, said the court’s ruling was “incomprehensible”.

“It is a signal that you can kill 228 people in an air crash and nobody is at fault. The families that I represent are devastated, and this has prevented them from mourning their loved ones,” Koubbi said after the hearing.

Koubbi said that while the two companies had been cleared of any criminal wrongdoing, the court had found in the families’ favour in a separate civil case, declaring Air France and Airbus jointly responsible for faults and opening the way to damages for the victims’ families. The exact amount of compensation will be announced in September.

“The court has decided that while no blame can be apportioned in criminal law, under civil law Air France and Airbus committed four faults and are responsible for damages,” Koubbi said.

The verdict followed a nine-week trial last year, at the end of which the public prosecutors’ office had suggested it was impossible to prove that either company was to blame.

At the opening of the trial in October, there were angry outbursts from the victims’ families as the chief executives of Air France and Airbus pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter and offered their condolences.

Flight AF447 was en route overnight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris when it disappeared off the radar in the middle of a storm over the Atlantic on 1 June 2009. It took four minutes and 24 seconds for the plane to fall 11,500 metres out of the night sky, during which the stall warning sounded 75 times, according to cockpit recordings.

The plane’s speed sensors, known as pitot tubes, were said to have iced up, turning off the autopilot, sending confusing information to the crew and setting off a catastrophic chain of events in the cockpit.

The case was the first time companies, as opposed to individuals, had been directly held to account in a trial after an air crash in France. Lawyers for passengers’ families battled for years to have their day in court. A 2019 decision to abandon the case, because investigators were unable to establish who was to blame, was overturned.

Air France and Airbus denied the accusations that their negligence had led to the crash. Airbus blames pilot error for the crash, while Air France claims alarms confused the pilots.

Days after the flight disappeared, debris was spotted floating in the ocean. But it took almost two years and a €31m (£27m) search to locate what remained of the plane on the seabed and recover the black box flight data and voice recorders. Only then could France’s air investigation agency (BEA) begin piecing together what had caused the crash.

The trial focused on a key question: why the flight crew of three, with more than 20,000 hours of flying experience between them, failed to understand that the plane had lost lift or “stalled” and was not rising but falling.

France’s air investigations authority, the Bureau d’Enquêtes et d’Analyses (BEA), said the crew had responded incorrectly to the icing problem but also had not had the training needed to fly manually at high altitude after the autopilot dropped out. It also highlighted inconsistent signals from a display called the flight director, which has since been redesigned to switch itself off in such events to avoid confusion.

The pilots could have saved the plane after it temporarily lost its speed readings. Instead of pushing the aircraft down, they had done the opposite of what was required, pulling it up to a height at which it stalled and fell from the sky at 10,000ft a minute, the BEA concluded.

Air France defended its pilots in a statement released at the same time as the report was made public, saying the attitude alert system had malfunctioned.

The flight captain, Marc Dubois, 58, had been resting when the Airbus began encountering turbulence, leaving co-pilots David Robert, 37, and Pierre-Cedric Bonin, 32, in the cockpit.

Bonin was at the controls when the speed sensors failed. When the autopilot reacted to the confused readings by disconnecting itself and handing control of the plane to the pilot, he reportedly hauled the aircraft up to 37,500ft in an apparent attempt to slow it down. As a consequence, the A330’s stall warning sounded, meaning that the plane’s aerodynamics were not generating enough lift even though its twin engines were working normally.

Robert, Bonin’s co-pilot at the time, supposedly checklisting the emergency procedures, lost precious seconds calling the captain and failed to correct his colleague’s error as the plane plunged towards the sea, said the report. Dubois returned to the cockpit seconds before the crash but was unable to save the situation as the plane hit the water."

Airbus subsidiary Aalto HAPS has signed a contract with Japan’s Space Compass Corporation for a proof of concept (PoC) demonstration flight of its stratospheric drone platform.

The Zephyr will be able to provide 4G/5G mobile connectivity to rural and under-served areas, or when connectivity is temporarily down.

Developed by Airbus and spun off into a separate company earlier this year, Aalto's Zephyr conducted a successful 64-day flight last year before failing when the HAPS dipped below its standard altitude of 70,000 ft. This latest PoC flight is expected to challenge that previous record.

Space Compass, a joint venture between NTT and SKY Perfect JSAT, has signed a contract with Aalto to work on a communications and earth observation service using HAPS starting in Japan as part of Space Compass’ “Space Integrated Computing Network.”

Airbus, NTT, DOCOMO, and SKY Perfect JSAT previously teamed up to jointly study connectivity services from HAPS in January 2022.

The Space Integrated Computing Network is proposed to include a variety of space-based ICT infrastructure, using GEO stationary satellites, LEO satellites, HAPS, Earth stations, and a data center in space.

As part of the company’s ‘Space Integrated Computing Network,’ Space Compass and space communication infrastructure developer Skyloom announced plans to launch a GEO data relay service over Asia in 2024, to be expanded globally by 2026. The system will use optical/laser communications terminals and enable GEO satellite direct-to-cloud transfers of data.

Earlier this month, Space Compass entered into an alliance with Axelspace Corporation to allow the latter to use Space Compass’ data relay services for Axelspace’s high-resolution Earth observation platform.

Also part of the computing network project, NTT and Sky Perfect announced in 2021 that they planned to launch a data center into space in 2025."

[Stay on top of transportation news: Get TTNews in your inbox.]

Boeing Co. delivered more jets in a single quarter than its archrival Airbus SE for the first time since mid-2018, a sign that the U.S. manufacturer’s production is getting back on track following years of disruptions.

The U.S. planemaker said April 11 that it delivered 130 aircraft in the first quarter, 37% more than a year ago, as it built cash-cow 737 jetliners at a steady cadence and cleared already-built Max and 787 Dreamliners from its storage yards. Airbus handed over 127 jets, a 9% drop from a year earlier, as it encountered parts shortages.

Boeing shipped 64 jets in March — nearly half its quarterly total — including 53 planes from its 737 family. It also recorded 60 new orders against 22 cancellations for the month.

That topped the 61 aircraft delivered in March by Airbus, the world’s biggest planemaker, whose factories are set to produce more jets each month.

Boeing shares rose 0.9% in late-morning trading in New York, while Airbus stock was little changed in Paris.

According to Bloomberg Intelligence, Boeing last out-delivered Airbus nearly five years ago as the European manufacturer faced engine shortages for its money-generating A320neo family. This time around, a dip in handovers to China’s airlines likely clipped Airbus’ results, said George Ferguson, an analyst with BI.

Both planemakers have struggled to keep pace with surging demand for fuel-efficient new jetliners in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Boeing and Airbus are grappling with disrupted shipments from their constellation of suppliers and their own shortfalls as they work to speed output.

Boeing delivered a 767-300 freighter to FedEx Corp. and 11 of its 787 Dreamliners during the quarter after pausing handovers to deal with manufacturing lapses. The planemaker also shipped 113 jets from its 737 family, most of them Max models.

Now that its 737 factory south of Seattle has settled into a 31-jet-a-month rhythm, Boeing is laying plans to hike output there by 23% by midyear, Bloomberg reported earlier this month.

Company executives are likely to provide more guidance on the so-called rate break when Boeing reports earnings later this month, Credit Suisse analyst Scott Deuschle said in a report April 10. He raised Boeing’s target price by $20 to $220 on improving production and deliveries — and also cited the probability that the company unveils a significant number of new jet orders during the Paris Air Show in June.

Airbus still landed more jet sales during the first quarter, tallying 142 after cancellations. Boeing had 120 gross orders and netted 107 sales, including cancellations and an accounting provision for at-risk deals.

Last week, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said the planemaker planned to ramp up production at its China assembly line from four planes a month to six later this year. The company has been adapting the factory in Tianjin so it can build the larger A321 model.

MHIRJ Adds Airbus A220 To Expanding Services Portfolio - Aviation Week,"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L21haW50ZW5hbmNlLXRyYWluaW5nL21oaXJqLWFkZHMtYWlyYnVzLWEyMjAtZXhwYW5kaW5nLXNlcnZpY2VzLXBvcnRmb2xpb9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ATLANTA—MHIRJ has added mobile-repair capability for the Airbus A220—the first step in a ramp-up that the company envisions leading to full airframe heavy maintenance work in 2024 as it expands its services portfolio beyond legacy regional aircraft platforms.

Adding the A220 “allows us to continue to grow the business beyond the base,” Ross Mitchell, VP of strategy, business development, marketing, communications and business operations, told Aviation Week at MRO Americas. “The base of the business was the CRJ. We’re moving beyond the CRJ, and the A220 is beyond the regional space, which is quite important to us as we move forward.”

The company, which took over CRJ aftermarket support when parent Mitsubishi Heavy Industries bought Bombardier’s regional jet program in 2020, has largely focused on supporting the legacy regional jets. Demand for the work is strong, but with the CRJ long out of production, the fleet is not growing, and airlines have been parking one-class, 50-seat variants.

In response, MHIRJ has been diversifying its offerings. Its components business is taking off. It now has two customers for Embraer ERJ-145 heavy maintenance, including a just-announced three-year deal with Piedmont Airlines. The first Piedmont aircraft will be inducted in May in MHIRJ’s 17-line Bridgeport, West Virginia, facility.

If all goes as planned, Bridgeport will begin welcoming A220s for unscheduled airframe work by the end of 2023, said SVP and head of aftermarket Ismail Mokabel. Then, in 2024, scheduled A220 checks would start.

“We start with a mobile repair team where the customer need is now, supporting the fleet that is flying today,” Mokabel said. “Then by the end of this year, we should be supporting unscheduled events in our shops, and then our aspiration is to be a heavy maintenance, fully spooled up organization.”

Like its legacy Bombardier and Embraer regional airframe business, the A220 airframe offering will target North American operators. It also could be a hint of what is to come as MHIRJ broadens its aftermarket capabilities. Larger platforms are among the possibilities, as both Bridgeport and the company’s 13-line Tucson, Arizona, shop can accommodate airframes larger than the A220.

“In 10 years, we’d like to be known as an aftermarket services company, and not the CRJ company,” Mitchell said."
"Airbus to open 2nd plane assembly line in China, double output - Tech Xplore","Thu, 06 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHhwbG9yZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLTA0LWFpcmJ1cy0ybmQtcGxhbmUtbGluZS1jaGluYS5odG1s0gFDaHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoeHBsb3JlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMtMDQtYWlyYnVzLTJuZC1wbGFuZS1saW5lLWNoaW5hLmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

Airbus aims to double its production capacity in China.

European planemaker Airbus said Thursday that it will double its production capacity in China, as it seeks to bolster its footprint in a crucial market and sidestep potential geopolitical risks.

Asia and China in particular are key targets for both Airbus and its American rival Boeing, which are looking to capitalise on surging demand for air travel by a rapidly expanding middle class.

""It makes a lot of sense for us, as the Chinese market keeps growing, to be serving local for the Chinese airlines, and probably some other customers in the region,"" Guillaume Faury said during a trip to China, where he is accompanying French President Emmanuel Macron.

Faury later signed a framework agreement to build a second final assembly line (FAL) at its factory in Tianjin, northeast China, for Airbus's hugely popular A320 family of medium-haul jets, at a ceremony attended by Macron and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

The new assembly line will begin operations in late 2025.

""It's a way to be probably more in sync with the way the world is developing, with tensions and with more complexities of doing business,"" Faury said.

""We are delivering more planes in China than what we can produce in China, but the lines are capable of serving other customers,"" he added.

The new Chinese site was part of Airbus's goal of raising its global annual production of A320 and A321 jets to 75 a month in 2026, up from 43 last year.

The company has an order backlog of around 7,300 planes, with customers often having to wait years for delivery.

Airbus's first assembly site in Tianjin, opened in 2008, is turning out four A320s a month, and the company aims to up that to six a month this year.

Huge potential

China is also pouring money into state-run manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), which is developing a narrow-bodied C919 jet to potentially rival Airbus's A320 and Boeing's B737.

In the meantime, Chinese carriers are big plane buyers, with Air China, China Eastern, China Southern and Shenzen Airlines announcing last July an order of 292 A320s.

The Chinese market represents one-fifth of global passenger air traffic, and Airbus expects growth of 5.3 percent a year through 2041, well above the 3.6 percent growth forecast at the global level.

That would put China's need for more efficient, less polluting planes over the next 20 years to around 8,500 models, Airbus says.

Meanwhile Boeing, which builds all its planes at US factories, has seen Chinese sales crumble since 2019.

It delivered just 12 planes to Chinese customers last year, compared to 95 for Airbus, and has booked just 18 new orders in China since 2018.

Boeing chief Dave Calhoun said in October that his firm is ""clear-eyed about the geopolitical risks that are out there, and we are not going to impart new risks on our investors"".

With the new Tianjin expansion, Airbus will have 10 final assembly lines (FAL) worldwide—two at its headquarters in Toulouse, southwest France; four in Hamburg, Germany; two in Mobile, Alabama and the two in China.

Starlux Pushes Airbus to Speed Up Deliveries - Airways Magazine,"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vc3Rhcmx1eC1haXJidXMtdG8tc3BlZWQtdXAtZGVsaXZlcmllcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DALLAS – Starlux Airlines (JX) is applying pressure on the European plane maker Airbus to speed up outstanding aircraft deliveries. The move comes as the Taiwanese carrier looks to expand its network.

Speaking to Reuters, the airline’s CEO, Glenn Chai, said that the five Airbus wide-bodies set for delivery next year are insufficient to meet the surge in demand post-pandemic. However, the manufactures production rate is yet to return to pre-pandemic levels.

Currently, JX has four Airbus A330-900s in service, the first of which arrived in February 2022, and four on order. In October 2022, it also took delivery of the first of 18 A350-900s it had on order and now has three in service.

Network Expansion

These incoming aircraft will allow the airline to expand its network outside of Asia. It will initially focus on the United States, with a new route from its Taipei Taoyuan International Airport (TPE) hub to Los Angeles (LAX) due to commence on April 26.

Mr Chai also said that San Francisco (SFO) would be added by the end of the year and that a New York route “is a must” for the airline. Once the North American market has been established, JX will turn its attention to Europe.

Starlux commenced operations in January 2020, flying between TPE and Macau (MFM). It was created in a bid to break up the duopoly of Eva Air (BR) and China Airlines (CI) in the Taiwanese market. However, its launch was hampered by the stringent COVID-19 restrictions imposed by the countries government, and its initial expansion was cautious.

Stellar: Etihad's Airbus A350 Business Class - One Mile at a Time,"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL2luc2lnaHRzL2V0aWhhZC1hMzUwLWJ1c2luZXNzLWNsYXNzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hello from Abu Dhabi! I just flew Etihad Airways’ Airbus A350-1000 business class on the 13hr25min from Chicago (I booked this using 70,000 American AAdvantage miles — what a deal!). This was my first time on Etihad’s newest jet, my first time experiencing Etihad’s new Armani / Casa amenities, and also my first time flying Etihad since the start of the pandemic.

Etihad has undergone some major changes in recent years (for better and worse), so I was curious to see how Etihad’s hard and soft product stacks up. Well, I’m happy to report that the experience was phenomenal, and this ranks as one of the top business class products in the world, in my opinion. I feel like Etihad has its groove back, though in a slightly more sustainable way than in 2015.

While I’ll have a full trip report soon, in this post I wanted to share some initial thoughts on the Etihad business class experience.

Etihad’s A350 business class seats are top notch

Etihad’s Airbus A350s have customized Collins Aerospace Super Diamond seats with doors. These are seats that were first rolled out on British Airways’ A350s, and this is among the best business class products out there.

I think most OMAAT readers have probably flown in a Super Diamond seat (whether with or without a door), so know what these seats are like.

But what impressed me was the tech, which was phenomenal. The seats had all the latest features, including USB-A, USB-C, AC, and wireless charging, as well as bluetooth audio.

Etihad’s cabin finishes are also gorgeous — I love the colors, and I like how there are no overhead bins in the center section of the cabin, which create such a spacious feeling (and the side bins are more than large enough for everyone’s carry-on bags).

While we can debate whether this constitutes hard or soft product, Etihad’s entertainment and Wi-Fi on the A350 are also excellent. There’s a huge selection of movies and TV shows, as well as live TV. On top of that, thanks to a recent positive change, Wi-Fi was available for the entire flight for just $20, with no data caps, and speeds were respectable.

Etihad A350 entertainment selection

The only thing about the hard product that I didn’t like was the lavatory situation. There were two lavatories at the front of the cabin, and that just doesn’t seem like enough bathrooms for a 44 seat cabin. There was often a wait to use the bathroom, more than there should be. For example, Qatar Airways’ 777s have 42 business class seats, and have four lavatories.

Etihad’s business class soft product is excellent

While Etihad has done some (justified) cost cutting over the years, I think the airline has now reached a pretty good balance. Etihad offers Armani / Casa amenities on its A350s, and I thought they were luxurious and functional. The bedding is from Armani / Casa, and is plush and cozy. Unfortunately the new Armani / Casa mattress pad hasn’t yet been rolled out, but that should be coming later this year.

Etihad business class Armani / Casa bedding

As far as amenities go, Etihad still has an Acqua di Parma amenity kit. I quite like the pouch, but it’s not particularly well stocked.

Etihad offers dine on demand in business class, and I found the food to be exceptionally good. There were a huge variety of options served on beautiful Armani / Casa tableware, and the crew didn’t seem to run out of anything.

After takeoff I enjoyed a glass of sauvignon blanc and some mixed nuts. I appreciate that wine is poured from the bottle at your seat.

Etihad business class meal service

For a starter, I selected a delicious tuna tataki dish, which was among the best tuna dishes I’ve had on a plane. That was served with some bread and a side salad.

Then for my main course, I selected the vegetable kofta, which I also enjoyed (I love Indian vegetarian food!).

For dessert I had a decadent chocolate fondant.

Then prior to landing, I had an açaí bowl with fruit and a croissant, which was a nice alternative to the typical airplane omelet or fruit plate.

Perhaps what I liked even more than the food was the non-alcoholic drink selection, including amazing cappuccinos and iced lattes. Yum, yum, yum.

The only part of the soft product that could have been better would be pajamas and/or slippers. Pajamas are of course nice, but on some level I consider them to be a gimmick, as I know they’re a costly investment for airlines. Personally I do value having slippers on a flight of this length, and wish Etihad would bring those back. I don’t like putting on my shoes every time I want to go to the bathroom, so being able to use disposable slippers is useful.

Amazing service also makes all the difference

Service on Middle Eastern carriers can be a mixed bag — sometimes it’s exceptional, and sometimes it’s just okay. On this flight I lucked out with an amazing crew, overseen by cabin manager Nicolas from France. The crew couldn’t have been more attentive or detail oriented, which is always a treat.

This is one of the world’s top business class products

It’s probably time I do a ranking of business class products, but without a doubt, Etihad’s A350 business class ranks in my top five business class products globally, given the excellent hard and soft product.

I think the question many people probably have is how Etihad’s new business class compares to Qatar Airways’ business class, which is otherwise often regarded as being among the best in the world. To be honest, both products are excellent, and I’d probably fly whichever product had a better routing for my itinerary, including factoring in connections. I’ll do a more detailed comparison of the two products after publishing my full review.

I love the Etihad Airbus A350!

Bottom line

I’m so happy I finally had the chance to fly Etihad’s A350 business class, and also experience the new Armani / Casa soft product. My love affair with Etihad was put on pause several years back when the airline seemed to do endless cost cutting, though I’m thrilled to see a positive turnaround.

Etihad’s A350 offers a lovely passenger experience, in terms of both hard and soft product. From the seats, to the entertainment and Wi-Fi, to the food and drinks, to the amenities, my flight couldn’t have been much better. I’d fly Etihad’s A350 again in a heartbeat.

If you’ve flown Etihad’s A350 business class, what was your experience like?"
Pontifications: Airbus grows in China while Boeing remains on the sidelines - Leeham News and Analysis,"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNC8xMS9wb250aWZpY2F0aW9ucy1haXJidXMtZ3Jvd3MtaW4tY2hpbmEtd2hpbGUtYm9laW5nLXJlbWFpbnMtb24tdGhlLXNpZGVsaW5lcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"April 11, 2023, © Leeham News: Airbus last week firmed up an order for 150 A320neos and 10 A350-900s with China. The deal was announced last year.

Additionally, Airbus and the Chinese government agreed to add to the A320 family assembly site in Tianjin, increasing the capacity of the plant. This will be another step in Airbus’ goal to achieve a production rate of 75 per month by 2026 for the A320 family.

And that’s not all. Airbus and the China National Aviation Fuel Group (CNAF) signed a Memorandum of Understanding to increase the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

Meanwhile, Boeing remains essentially frozen out of China. Deliveries of the 737 MAX remain stalled. Although China Southern Airlines outlined expected deliveries this year and through the next few years, we’ve seen this sort of thing before. Until an official announcement comes from Beijing authorizing deliveries, or some of the stored airplanes are delivered, words are just words.

That said, there are some solid indications we’re seeing that Boeing deliveries to China may well resume in the not-too-distant future, but on a glacial pace. The financial viability of some airlines within China, while opaque to outsiders, is monitored by the CAAC, China’s regulator. Some airlines are deemed too financially risky now to accept delivery of any new aircraft, whether the OEM is Boeing or Airbus.

While Boeing’s 140 MAXes originally ordered by China remained in a Twilight Zone of sorts, delivery of some Airbus A320neos also has been blocked. Generally, though, Airbus continues to tender airplanes and win orders while Boeing sits on the sidelines.

Boeing to up production

Meanwhile, Boeing will up production of the 737 from 31/mo to 38. Stan Deal, the CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, signaled an increase during a speech at the Wings Club last month. Bloomberg News first reported the story last week. Bloomberg reports the rate hike is planned for mid-year, a few months ahead of schedule.

“Executives at Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc., which manufactures the aluminum frame for the narrow-body jets, said in February they plan to hike output for 737 parts to a 38-jet monthly pace by August, and a 42-jet pace by October, under a schedule hammered out with Boeing,” Bloomberg reported.

The rate hike is good news—if Boeing can perform. It’s struggled to consistently hit rate 31, citing supply chain issues and its own internal problems—mainly a workforce at the Renton 737 plant that is no longer operated the smoothly running, highly experienced workforce it once had. During the 21-month grounding of the MAX and throughout the COVID pandemic, Boeing offered early retirement to thousands of workers. After the grounding was lifted and the pandemic eased, Boeing hired new employees who have a learning curve to return to previous efficiencies and production levels.

For much of last year, when production rates were supposed to 31/mo, Boeing was pressed to roll new 737s out the door at a rate in the mid-20s.

COMAC C919

COMAC received certification for its C919 late last year from CAAC, China’s regulator. The first commercial version (as opposed to flight test models) was handed over to China Eastern Airlines. Four months later, the aircraft still has not entered service.

First Parts of Airbus A350F Begin Construction - Airways Magazine,"Wed, 05 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vZmlyc3QtcGFydHMtYTM1MGYtYmVnaW4tY29uc3RydWN0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DALLAS – Production of Airbus’ newest freighter, the A350F, is well underway, with the European manufacturer announcing that the first parts for the Centre Wing Box (CWB) have been cut.

The parts are being produced by Airbus Atlantic. The new company was created in January 2022 when STELIA Aerospace and the Airbus factories at Nantes and Montoir-de-Bretagne were amalgamated.

Airbus Atlantic already produces the CWB for the passenger variant of the A350. However, the freighter variant will have reinforced floor beams that can support the heaviest cargo loads.

Design Changes

According to Airbus, several design changes will therefore be required, which will ‘affect the internal CWB composite struts and the metallic (aluminium-lithium) structure on top of the upper composite CWB cover which supports the floor.’ The CWB for the freighter will measure 6.5m long by 5.5m wide by 3.9 metres tall.

Fifteen out of the 38 working stations at the Nantes facility have been adapted to allow the construction of CWBs for all A350 variants: Freighter, -900 and -1000.

Once completed, the parts will be transported by road to Airbus Atlantic’s factory at Montoir-de-Bretagne. Here it will be installed into the prototype’s centre fuselage before being transported by Airbus’ Beluga to the A350 Final Assembly Line (FAL) in Toulouse.

About the A350F

Airbus launched the A350F in July 2021, and is expected to enter service in 2025. The plane maker claims that the type will be able to ‘carry a payload of up to 109 tonnes over a range of 4,700nm.’

At the time of writing, the A350F had received 35 orders from various leasing companies and cargo operators, including Air Lease Corporation, Air France and Etihad Airways.

Air France and plane manufacturer Airbus have been acquitted over the 2009 crash of a Rio-Paris flight after a French court ruled their errors could not be proven as the disaster’s cause.

While the ruling was expected after prosecutors recommended to the Paris court not to seek a conviction, it is still a huge blow for families of victims who have waged a 14-year campaign for justice.

The two France-based companies went on trial in October to determine their responsibility for the worst aviation disaster in Air France’s history, which left all 228 people on board flight AF447 dead.

Prosecutors said as hearings in the eight-week trial wound up in December that it was “impossible” to convict the two aviation giants, which were charged with involuntary manslaughter but deny the charges.

If convicted, the two companies would have faced a fine of 225,000 euros ($250,000) as well as significant reputational damage.

As the verdict was read out, relatives of the victims present in court stood up, appearing stunned, then sat down again.

“We expected an impartial judgement; this was not the case. We are disgusted,” said Daniele Lamy, president of the association that represents the victims.

“All that remains of these 14 years of waiting is despair, dismay and anger,” she was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency.

‘Imprudence’

The hearings in Paris centred on the role of defective so-called Pitot tubes, which are used to measure the flight speed of aircraft.

The court heard how a malfunction with the tubes, which became blocked with ice crystals during a mid-Atlantic storm, caused alarms to sound in the cockpit of the Airbus A330 and the autopilot system to switch off.

Technical experts highlighted how, after the instrument failure, the pilots put the plane into a climb that caused the aircraft to lose upward lift from the air moving under its wings, thus losing altitude.

Air France and Airbus have blamed pilot error as the main cause of the crash.

But lawyers for the families have argued that both companies were aware of the Pitot tube problem before the crash, and that the pilots were not trained to deal with such a high-altitude emergency.

The court said Airbus committed “four acts of imprudence or negligence”, including not replacing certain models of the Pitot tubes that seemed to freeze more often on its A330-A340 fleet, and “withholding information” from flight operators.

It said Air France had committed two “acts of imprudence” in the way it disseminated an informational note on the faulty tubes to its pilots.

But there was not a strong enough causal link between these failings and the accident to show an offence had been committed.

Prosecutors initially dropped charges against the companies in 2019 in a decision that also infuriated victims’ families.

A Paris appeals court overturned this decision in 2021 and ordered the trial to go ahead."
Airbus Replaces A320neo Family Program Chief - Aviation Week,"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcmNyYWZ0LXByb3B1bHNpb24vYWlyYnVzLXJlcGxhY2VzLWEzMjBuZW8tZmFtaWx5LXByb2dyYW0tY2hpZWbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FRANKFURT—Airbus has decided to change leadership of the important A320neo family program, as the program continues to struggle to meet its internal output targets.

Michael Menking, who has run the program since 2019, is being replaced by Christoph Zammert, Executive Vice President Products and Services at Airbus Helicopters.

The move comes after Airbus had missed its 2022 delivery targets for the A320neo program by a significant margin. At the time, Airbus largely attributed the shortfall to supplier issues that are affecting the entire industry. However, January’s delivery performance rang alarm bells internally as Airbus only put out 20 A320neo family aircraft. The numbers have improved since as Airbus handed over a total of 106 of the narrowbodies in the first three months of the year.

But the average output of just 35 aircraft per month is falling far short of its ambitions to fast grow production.

Airbus aims at delivering a total of 720 aircraft in 2023, up from 661 in 2022, and about the same number it had initially targeted for last year. The bulk of production is made up by the A320neo family as A330neos, A350s and A220s are produced at much lower rates—or just below three, five and six aircraft per month, respectively.

The company was forced to delay its ramp-up to 75 aircraft by one year to 2026, again mainly citing supplier delays. But the move to replace Menking shows that internal shortcomings are being recognized more and more by the company’s leadership. Menking is being moved to a special projects role, reporting to Philippe Mhun, Executive Vice President Programs and Services.

Airbus is in the process of resetting its A320neo production system, an exercise that will still take several years to complete. A second final assembly line will be added in Mobile, Alabama, in 2024 with a second line also opening in Tianjin, China, at the end of 2025. Airbus also recently decided to move two modernized A320neo family lines into the former A380 final assembly hangar in Toulouse, closing the legacy production facility that has been operating since the start of the program in the 1980s.

Hamburg remains the largest A320neo production site, and it, too, is undergoing gradual modernization. But because of the challenges in the ramp-up, Airbus has slowed down the introduction of new techniques to be able to focus on delivering the volumes promised to its customers.

Airbus did not officially comment."
"First pair of second-generation weather satellites, built by Airbus, enter their test phase - Airbus","Wed, 05 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLTA0LWZpcnN0LXBhaXItb2Ytc2Vjb25kLWdlbmVyYXRpb24td2VhdGhlci1zYXRlbGxpdGVzLWJ1aWx0LWJ5LWFpcmJ1cy1lbnRlctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus built satellite twins, MetOp-SG A and B will provide a panoply of new meteorological data that will substantially improve numerical weather prediction - the backbone of our daily weather forecasts - at regional and global levels. The multiple instruments on-board will also provide key observations for climate monitoring, atmospheric chemistry and other services such as air pollution, hydrology, land use, and oceanography that will help prevent climate change.

MetOp-SG comprises two satellite series, with three units in each series. Flying in a polar orbit, they are able to observe the entire planet in fine detail providing vital information on storms, volcanoes, landslides, wildfires, and other natural events on Earth. The A series carries optical and atmospheric instruments, essential to identify specific types of clouds from space or determine storm intensity. The B series hosts microwave instruments able to measure through cloud cover to detect precipitation, temperature in different layers of the atmosphere, and surface characteristics like ocean surface winds.

MetOp-SG-A and B are fully integrated and starting their test campaigns - Copyright Airbus

The integration of the first MetOp-SG-A, built at Airbus in Toulouse (France), was finalised last October with the installation of the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer – New Generation (IASI-NG), the most complex of the satellite’s instruments. Four times more precise than its predecessor. IASI-NG will determine temperature and water vapour profiles in the atmosphere, record ocean surface and land temperatures and monitor a wide range of chemical compounds and other key variables for climate research, including greenhouse gases, desert dust and cloud cover. IASI-NG will be a powerful tool for weather forecasting and to monitor the climate’s health at any moment in time to secure life and property on Earth. The spacecraft has completed its mechanical tests proving the satellite can withstand the harsh vibrations of launch and the solar panels have been deployed. Next up, the thermal vacuum test in space-like conditions to make sure the spacecraft can operate in space.

Integration of MetOp-SG-B was completed last week at Airbus in Friedrichshafen (Germany) with the installation of the advanced scatterometer, and the spacecraft is about to undergo its environmental test campaign. This scatterometer provides double the resolution than the previous, and will be used to monitor ocean winds and continental ice sheets, and to check land-surface soil moisture – a key driver of water and heat fluxes between the ground and the atmosphere. Scatterometers have been used to study unusual weather phenomena such as El Niño, the long-term effects of deforestation and changes in sea-ice masses around the poles. All of which play a central role in monitoring climate change.

Airbus leads an industrial consortium comprising more than 110 companies in 16 European countries and Canada, on the complex MetOp-SG missions, the standard-bearers for sustainability.

The first launch of the MetOp-SG mission is scheduled for 2025 after completion of satellite level testing. The nominal operational lifetime of each of the three MetOp-SG satellites is 7.5 years, and will ensure full operational coverage over a 21-year period. MetOp-SG is a cooperative undertaking between the European Space Agency (ESA) and EUMETSAT, the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites.

Airbus Defence and Space has a long track record in building meteorological satellites of more than 30 years. The company was prime contractor for the previous MetOp (Meteorological Operational Polar) series of meteorological satellites and also built the SEVIRI instrument flying on the spacecraft as well as Aeolus, the first spacecraft capable of performing global wind-component profile observations, daily and close to real time. Airbus is involved in most ESA’s Earth Explorer missions, and in all the Sentinel and Copernicus programmes. Always pioneering on the positive impact these programmes have on the world and its citizens by respecting the planet and its sustainability, valuing people, and enabling prosperity.

Currently, Earth-observation satellites are at the forefront of monitoring deforestation, rising sea levels and greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, all having a key impact in climate behaviour. Airbus has built many of these satellites and transforms geospatial data into actionable insight to help fight climate change. Today, 20 Airbus satellites are involved in climate change monitoring and an additional 20 are in development that will measure key atmospheric constituents, land and sea topography, air quality, temperature and humidity, and snow and ice coverage. This critical geospatial data enables us to: provide scientists with a better understanding of the Earth’s system and evolution, help governments and humanitarian agencies prepare for and manage disasters to save lives, and generate environmental impact assessments for large industries.

Airbus and Safran finalise acquisition of troubled strategic parts firm Aubert & Duval - Flightglobal,"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mbGlnaHRnbG9iYWwuY29tL2Flcm9zcGFjZS9haXJidXMtYW5kLXNhZnJhbi1maW5hbGlzZS1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbi1vZi10cm91YmxlZC1zdHJhdGVnaWMtcGFydHMtZmlybS1hdWJlcnQtYW5kLWR1dmFsLzE1MzA2NC5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus and Safran have finalised the acquisition of specialist materials supplier Aubert & Duval, a year after disclosing that they were seeking to take over the loss-making firm in order to reinforce the aerospace supply chain.

Previously owned by French minerals and metals company Eramet, the subsidiary specialises in strategic critical parts to various precision industries.

Eramet had signalled on 27 April that the conditions for the sale had been fulfilled, and Airbus and Safran have jointly confirmed the finalisation.

“Completion of this acquisition represents a crucial step towards the creation of a leading European player in critical parts and materials,” says Airbus chief Guillaume Faury.

He says the agreement will reduce geopolitical risks of supply, and points out that the company’s capabilities not only include steels and superalloys but also, more recently, titanium expertise.

Aubert & Duval has been loss-making for the past few years, after the company experienced logistics issues in 2019 and then – with 70% of its activity focused on aerospace – was badly affected by the onset of the pandemic the following year. It also suffered a fire at its Pamiers plant in September 2021.

Over the full year 2022 the subsidiary generated an EBITDA loss of €47 million ($52 million) on turnover of €553 million, which Eramet attributed to higher energy and raw material costs.

Eramet stated last year that the divestment transaction for Aubert & Duval would be based on an enterprise value of €95 million.

Airbus and Safran have not detailed the terms of the acquisition, but the takeover consortium also includes Tikehau Capital as a financing partner.

Faury says Airbus will fully support Aubert & Duval as it undertakes an “ambitious” transformation plan, while Tikehau Capital private equity chair Marwan Lahoud – Airbus’s former chief strategy officer – says it will be “aiding the company’s recovery”.

Aubert & Duval employs around 3,700 personnel, primarily in France. Following the acquisition the company will be led by Bruno Durand, who previously held several high-profile positions at Safran, particularly roles connected with the engine supply chain.

Safran chief Olivier Andries, recently speaking during the company’s first-quarter briefing, said: “There’s going to be a significant amount of capex and investing to be done [in Aubert & Duval] in the years to come. We are talking three-digit numbers for capex.”

The three consortium partners will equally fund the investment.

“Obviously there is going to be a cash-burn in the years to come because we need to invest to recover the performance,” Andries adds.

He says the acquisition will ensure “European sovereignty” of strategic programmes for civil and military engines, and “secure” the supply chain for crucial parts.

“I am confident the new team will carry through the transformation project to get this leading French industry player back on track,” he states.

France’s government will retain a golden share in Aubert & Duval to protect strategic interests."

The AH-125 Ares will be configured as the H125’s armed variant, while the MH-125 will be a multi-role helicopter for various tactical operations.

The latest weapons integration capability enables modification of H125s between multiple mission sets in less than 30 minutes. Configurations include combat, air assault, search and rescue, light attack, and humanitarian operations.

Works for the AH-125 and MH-125 production will be carried out at the company’s facility in Columbus, Mississippi.

“The AH-125 and MH-125 Ares helicopters will offer the capability, reliability and flexibility needed by America’s allies and partners as they perform an array of rotary wing missions, ranging from light attack to disaster response and other parapublic missions,” Airbus US Space and Defense Vice President Scott Tumpak stated.

MAG Aerospace for Weapons Installation

Airbus will work with Virginia-based MAG Aerospace on the weapons engineering, assembly, installation, and certification.

Ordnance for the new H125s will include .50-caliber 12.7-millimeter guns, unguided rockets, and precision-guided weapons.

The installations permit “doors-on” flight throughout tactical missions.

“MAG Aerospace is thrilled to team with Airbus to combine our unique platform engineering and modification capabilities with the world-class leader in the single-engine helicopter market,” MAG Aerospace President Matt Bartlett said.

“It’s an honor to work with Airbus and expand our ability to serve our partners in the U.S. and around the world.”

H125 Family in US Military

Airbus says about 80 percent of the global single-engine helicopter market consists of its H125 helicopter line. The aircraft has the highest certified modifications available.

US Customs and Border Protection flies over 100 H125s, making the country the single largest operator of the vehicle.

Since 2006, over 480 UH-72A and UH-72B Lakota-variant helicopters have become operational in the US Army and National Guard.

The US Coast Guard also deploys nearly 100 MH-65 Dolphin-variants for anti-drug missions, homeland security, and humanitarian aid."
"How to Make Airbus A380 Airworthy After Sitting for 1,000 Days - Jalopnik","Mon, 17 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vamFsb3BuaWsuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLWJlY29tZXMtYWlyd29ydGh5LXNpdHRpbmctZGVzZXJ0LTEwMDAtZGF5cy0xODUwMzQzOTk30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When the entire world was swept up in the COVID-19 pandemic at the beginning of 2020, one of the hardest hit industries was air travel. As the demand for flying fizzled, airlines scrambled to put their no-longer-needed planes in storage. The Airbus A380 was no exception. At 239 feet long, 262 feet wide and 79 feet tall, it’s the biggest passenger jet ever created, and for a while no one really needed or wanted it. But, as demand for air travel has increased, so has the need for the 560 ton A380.

In case you missed it:

Keeping these super-jumbos airworthy is no easy task on its own, but when you add 1,000 days of sitting in a California desert to the mix, thing’s get really complicated. It brings up the question: how do you get an A380 going again after it’s been sitting for nearly three years? Well, The Sydney Morning Herald has given us the answer: a lot of hard work.

The outlet says that because of the sheer size and complexity of the A380, it requires 4,500 hours of maintenance and repairs. The plane’s 22 wheels, 16 brakes and internal furnishing will be replaced. So will all oxygen cylinders, fire extinguishers and inflatable slides. That’s all well and good, but actually getting those parts is proving to be an issue for airlines because of ongoing global supply chain issues.

According to the Morning Herald, waking up an A380 in the Mojave Desert to bring it back to Australia was a pretty miserable task.

For Qantas engineers, reviving an A380 meant two months of work per aircraft in the sweltering Mojave Desert. Some lucky engineers were tasked with whacking the wheels of each plane to rid them of rattlesnakes or other unsuspecting foes. The airline’s executive manager of engineering, Scott McConnell, said 100 of his engineers found themselves working through extreme weather – ranging from snow and icy cold storms to unforgiving heat. The only constant was the dust that enveloped everything. “The entire aircraft is wrapped to protect it from moisture, dust and insects. Every opening, panel and crack is taped up – and that’s just the outside. There’s plastic covering everything from the carpets to the seats inside. And there’s desiccant everywhere. Picture unwrapping a new shoe, except bigger,” McConnell said.

After the aircraft is unwrapped, it has to be inspected, as you may have imagined. Engineers have to make sure all the gear, sensors and even the engines are in good working order. It takes a hell of a long time, and that’s all just to get it out of the desert and moved to another maintenance facility in Los Angeles. From there, it’s about 1,000 hours of additional maintenance before returning to service.

Qantas has reportedly stored 12 of its A380s at the Victorville boneyard in the Mojave desert. Seven of them have already been put back to service on the airline’s London, Los Angeles and Hong Kong routes. Three more are expected to return sometime in 2024 after the maintenance process is done, and the final two will sadly be left at the boneyard and parted out.

Airbus hands over first two H145 helicopters to Bavarian Police - Vertical Magazine,"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1cy1oYW5kcy1vdmVyLWZpcnN0LXR3by1oMTQ1LWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLXRvLWJhdmFyaWFuLXBvbGljZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has delivered the first two of eight five-bladed H145s to the Bavarian Police. These first two helicopters will be used in the training of pilots and crews which will begin shortly, ensuring a smooth transition from the current H135 fleet which has been in service for more than twelve years, to the larger H145 helicopters. Delivery of the first fully equipped police helicopter is scheduled for the middle of next year.



“We would like to thank Bavaria and its police force for their continued confidence in our helicopters,” said Stefan Thomé, Managing Director of Airbus Helicopters in Germany. “We are proud to equip the Bavarian police with the most advanced helicopters available for law enforcement missions, supporting them in keeping our communities safe.”

“Our police forces have to deal with a wide range of scenarios: searching for missing persons, transporting special units, fighting forest fires or dealing with natural disasters. The H145, with its outstanding performance and mission capabilities, will provide our police forces with an essential tool to fulfill these diverse missions,” said Franz Muschick, Head of the Bavarian Police Helicopter Squadron.



Bavaria’s fully-equipped H145s will feature some of the most advanced police equipment available. This includes a state of the art computer system with tactical police mission software, easily operated by a foldable flat-screen mission command station for an operator in the cabin and a stowable monitor for the copilot. The crew will be aided by a modern lighting concept and leading-edge camera solutions, offering better situational awareness of the helicopter’s surroundings and events on the ground. The overall communication is facilitated due to customer-specific radio and data transfer means. A next-generation hoist and the capability to transport external loads as well as for allowing for firefighting, will further enhance police mission capabilities. Additional features, such as illuminated blade tips, improve the safety on board during essential police operations.



The new version of Airbus’ best-selling H145 light twin-engine helicopter adds a new, innovative five-bladed rotor to the multi-mission aircraft, increasing the useful load of the helicopter by 150kg. The simplicity of the new bearingless main rotor design also eases maintenance operations, further improving the benchmark serviceability and reliability of the H145, while improving ride comfort for both passengers and crew.



In total, there are more than 1,600 H145 family helicopters in service, logging a total of more than seven million flight hours. Powered by two Safran Arriel 2E engines, the H145 is equipped with full authority digital engine control (FADEC) and the Helionix digital avionics suite. It includes a high performance 4-axis autopilot, increasing safety and reducing pilot workload. Its particularly low acoustic footprint makes the H145 the quietest helicopter in its class, while its CO2 emissions are the lowest amongst its competitors. More than 200 H145 helicopters are in service around the world in public service and law enforcement missions.

This severe weather event followed high rainfall in January that had already caused extensive damage to the North Island, including in Auckland. A key contributor to the disaster relief operations led by the National Emergency Management Agency and regional civil emergency authorities, the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) was able to rely on a significant ally throughout the rescue operations: the NH90.

Squadron rose to the challenge with the NH90 after Cyclone Gabrielle

Even before Gabrielle reached New Zealand, first responders were part of careful planning and organisation. Ahead of the cyclone, the NZDF had personnel on stand-by, ready to assist with the emergency response: air and land elements were quickly deployed to assist with the immediate response including the evacuation of residents, and provided reconnaissance flights to help authorities understand the impact of the cyclone and assist with planning relief efforts. At the height of the climatic event, extensive damage to roads, and widespread power and communications outages caused multiple operational challenges for all agencies engaged in the emergency response. The NZDF mobilised nearly 1,000 personnel, along with several ships, aircraft, and numerous military vehicles.

To sustain the disaster relief effort, No. 3 Squadron deployed three NH90 helicopters to Hawke’s Bay and one to Auckland. “By the end of the first week of emergency response, the Air Force’s NH90s had distributed more than 42.5 tonnes of essential supplies throughout Hawkes Bay and Tairāwhiti, flying for more than 120 hours and transporting more than 260 civilian and military personnel, along with 17 dogs and five cats, and had underslung more than 13 tonnes of equipment”, says Wing Commander Greg Jane, Commanding Officer of No.3 Squadron.

An essential contribution to the emergency response

The NH90 proved to be a versatile asset, supporting No.3 Squadron all along. The rotorcraft performed a variety of missions, ranging from rescue and relocation of individuals in peril during the first stage of operations, to transporting necessities such as food, water and medical supplies to isolated or cut-off communities later on. Using the NH90’s powerful capabilities, members of No.3 Squadron evacuated residents from flooded areas by winching them off the roofs of their houses: “Our NH90 helicopters evacuated around 250 people in Hawke’s Bay, from around the Puketapu area, as well as transporting other people from Gisborne to Wairoa and Napier”, says Wing Commander Jane.

Squadron rose to the challenge with the NH90 after Cyclone Gabrielle



To help mitigate the harsh flying conditions, with low clouds and heavy rain, No.3 Squadron could count on the military helicopter’s reliability in a hostile operating environment. According to Wing Commander Jane, “one advantage that the NH90 has over many helicopters is its size and weight. This weight provides some stability from gusty conditions, which may have provided some advantage.” Consequently, over the course of February 2023, the crew’s NH90 logged a record number of flight hours since the introduction of the rotorcraft in the Royal New Zealand Air Force’s fleet: “The NH90 is an incredibly capable helicopter, and performed exceptionally well during this operation. 302.9 hours were flown which is around 60 hours more than the previous record for flying hours in a month”, explains Wing Commander Jane.

Surging to save lives

The rate of operations pushed people to the limit, as a large number of personnel were deployed to support the Rotary Wing Task Unit. “Most of the No.3 Squadron aircrew were in Hawke’s Bay at some point, supported by the entire squadron maintenance team who worked tirelessly – be that a small group deployed in Hawke’s Bay or those back at Royal New Zealand Air Force Base Ohakea, who were required to conduct crucial servicings on the aircraft to keep the operation going”, says Wing Commander Jane.

Squadron rose to the challenge with the NH90 after Cyclone Gabrielle

This joint effort from No.3 Squadron and the entire NZDF also relied on Base Ohakea: a deployed refuel team operated in Hawke’s Bay with the NH90, and other refuellers provided a bridge from Ohakea to ensure the aircraft did not need to draw on local fuel supplies.

Overall, the smooth organisation of the disaster relief operations and the NH90’s exceptional capabilities for emergency response were the perfect match to support the crew’s relentless efforts to save lives in the aftermath of cyclone Gabrielle. “We asked the team to surge and they did. The NZDF is a Force for New Zealand, and when New Zealand or New Zealanders need our support, all of our people drop everything to do so. Everyone involved felt extremely grateful that they were able to help”, Wing Commander Jane concludes. No.3 Squadron and its fleet of NH90 remain mobilised throughout the recovery efforts on the East Coast of the country"

Airbus introduces first American-built H125 military configurations - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWludHJvZHVjZXMtZmlyc3QtYW1lcmljYW4tYnVpbHQtaDEyNS1taWxpdGFyeS1tdWx0aS1taXNzaW9uLWNvbmZpZ3VyYXRpb25zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters is developing new U.S.-designed armed and multi-mission military configurations of its H125, known as the AH-125 and MH-125 Ares.

During a media briefing on April 24, Scott Tumpak, vice president of military line of business at Airbus U.S. Space and Defense, told reporters that the new offerings will be equipped with militarized options for military and parapublic partners to perform a range of missions, including light attack, disaster response, search-and-rescue (SAR), casualty evacuation, and other parapublic missions.

“We see a lot of armed forces around the world go for secondary or seasonal missions,” Tumpak said. “An example is firefighting or disaster response where this aircraft, compared to some other dedicated light attack aircraft, could be an asset for those mission.”

Both variants will include an existing off-the-shelf communications and navigation suite, with air traffic control radio, military radio and Garmin avionics. The variants are also equipped with a 15” EO/IR sensor option, a downlink/uplink system for data sharing, and cockpit and cargo area ballistic protection.

Airbus is referring to the AH-125 as its armed variant of the helicopter. Its base configuration will include a .50-caliber (12.7-millimeter) gun and unguided rockets, installed to allow for doors-on flight throughout the mission. It will also be capable of holding precision-guided weapons based on customer requirements.

MAG Aerospace will be designing and manufacturing the aircraft’s flexible weapons capability, allowing for rapid reconfiguration between mission sets. In fact, Airbus claims operators can convert to various military and parapublic operations in less than 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, the MH-125 Ares variant — designed for multiple missions — will be capable of carrying up to four internal and four external operators. Features include a fully integrated fast rope, searchlights, cargo swing, floats and a 600-pound (272-kilogram) capable hoist.

“We [develop] the only single-engine aircraft that has a hoist capability outside of the skids as opposed to through the skids, which is a vastly preferable way to operate a search-and-rescue mission,” Tumpak told reporters.

“There’s not a single-engine aircraft on the market that offers international users an easily reconfigurable and multi-mission capability,” Tumpak added. “We see the AH-125 and the MH-125 as capabilities that uniquely address what’s an open niche in the market.”

The new types will leverage the H125’s existing production line at Airbus’s Columbus, Mississippi, facility, and will be available through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program and Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) for customers looking for a U.S.-made product

Tumpak said Airbus has gleaned feedback from existing customers to help inform these new offerings, and while the company remains tight-lipped on its first launch customers, Tumpak confirmed Airbus is targeting the export market.

“The overall global security situation remains in flux, and there’s a lot of places around the world where we see emerging demand for rotorcraft weapons systems, attack, special ops, [and] the search-and-rescue configurations,” he said.

With Airbus’s 30 customer support centers, 19 training and simulation centers, 92 service centers, and four technical support hubs, the company said it’s prepared to provide customers with parts availability and technical support on the new offering.

“Anywhere around the world, you are never very far at all from parts support or training, and then with our four technical hubs spread across multiple time zones, it’s basically 24/7 support and/or your local support via Latin America, Africa, or Asia,” Tumpak said.

He said the new offerings represent the latest evolution of Airbus’s H125 family of helicopters, which account for almost 80 percent of the single-engine market. With more than 7,000 aircraft delivered to 2,014 customers around the world, the H125s have accumulated more than 38 million flight hours.

Boasting a useful load of 2,386 pounds (1,082 kilograms) and maximum external takeoff weight of 6,172 lb (2,800 kg), the H125 holds records for performing well in hot and high environments. This includes achieving the highest helicopter flight in history at 42,500 feet (12,954 meters) and the highest landing in history at 29,029 ft. (8,848 m)."
How Airbus Helicopters North America President and Regional Head Romain Trapp Has Piloted Through Economic ... - D Magazine,"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL3B1YmxpY2F0aW9ucy9kLWNlby8yMDIzL2FwcmlsL2hvdy1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtbm9ydGgtYW1lcmljYS1wcmVzaWRlbnQtYW5kLXJlZ2lvbmFsLWhlYWQtcm9tYWluLXRyYXBwLWhhcy1waWxvdGVkLXRocm91Z2gtZWNvbm9taWMtc3Rvcm1zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Standing inside a delivery facility in Grand Prairie, Romain Trapp realized the full impact of his work leading Airbus Helicopters North America. In the beginning, he thought its primary value was in connecting people. But as he watched roughly a dozen nurses smiling through tears at a delivery ceremony for the hospital’s newest choppers, Trapp knew his career’s larger purpose. “It was the first time I understood what helicopters are about—saving lives and protecting people,” he says.

Romain Trapp has held eight roles over 25 years at Airbus and led its U.S. helicopter branch to $1.1 billion in revenue in 2022.

Trapp joined France-based Airbus 25 years ago and has held eight roles in four countries during his tenure. Now, as president and regional head of the company’s North American helicopter headquarters in Grand Prairie, he oversees more than 1,000 employees in the U.S. and Canada. Since taking the helm, he has guided Airbus Helicopters to become a market leader that generated more than $1.1 billion in revenue last year.

He grew up in Buhl-Lorraine in France’s wooded northeast, spending summers caring for his neighbors’ farm animals and preparing livestock feed. “My parents were not farmers; they were nurses,” Trapp says. “But we had farms all around us.” Back then, the potential he had to one day lead within a global corporate enterprise was hidden, even to him. He stood barely five feet tall until his senior year in high school when he shot up more than a foot, was very shy, and “didn’t have a lot of ambition.” He thought he’d be a banker at the small bank in the next town over or work at a financial institution in the closest city. “The change, the job, and the ambition came step by step,” Trapp says.

The change came after Trapp graduated with his second master’s degree in economics and finance at École Normale Supérieure in Paris. A newlywed, he moved to Toulouse in the south of France and began looking for work while his wife finished her Ph.D. in business management. “I looked on the map and I said, ‘What are the companies in Toulouse?’ and I said, ‘Oh! There is Airbus. I’m going to work for Airbus,’” Trapp recalls.

Airbus has a helicopter contract with the United States Coast Guard that dates back to 1979 and extends into 2040.

It was a bit spontaneous and not the banking role he was working toward, but Trapp landed an interview with Airbus’ deputy CFO for a post as a cost accounting manager. The executive reviewed Trapp’s resume and asked why he’d prefer to work at Airbus when his background lent itself so obviously toward banking. “I explained that for me, it was important to make a connection between the figures I would be dealing with as a finance guy and a product we can touch and feel and that makes me dream,” Trapp says.

He secured the job and moved into an office overlooking the final assembly line of the Airbus 320 airplane—the best-selling single-aisle fleet worldwide. Three years later, he was promoted to business controller. His ascent then took him to one of the company’s global divisional headquarters in Munich, where he served as corporate controller of the airplane division. By the end of his first decade of work, he was back in France, overseeing more than 400 employees and 30 offices and subsidiaries worldwide as VP of controlling and administration. “Then, one day, I got a call saying, ‘Romain, you have been put on a short list to become the chief financial officer of Airbus Helicopters in the U.S.,’” he remembers.

The Multicultural Innovator Since immigrating in 2008, Romain Trapp has embraced American culture without forgetting his French roots. Romain Trapp says conversations in his house are “really Franglish,” with his wife and sons communicating in a changing blend of French and English that reflects the family’s love for both their French roots and American home. Nowhere is Trapp’s multicultural identity more evident than his work with the European American Chamber of Commerce Texas, where he currently serves as vice chair. Originally operating as the French-American Chamber of Commerce, the group transitioned to a broader platform in 2021. “[Trapp] was the one who suggested we become the European American Chamber of Commerce in Texas, because he felt like Airbus is European, not just French,” says EACCTX president and chair Ruth Baron. The French moniker was more than 41 years old, but Trapp felt a change would promote the chamber’s growth. “He wants to keep learning, pushing, and innovating,” Baron says. “It doesn’t matter where he is. I think that is inherent in him.”

Trapp was not familiar with the helicopter market and never thought about moving to the states—let alone Grand Prairie, Texas. His impression of the Lone Star State centered around longhorns, cowboys, and the countryside. “In Europe, it’s all about ‘Dallas,’ the series,” he laughs. “I thought about the ranch.” He knew he could make the jump from airplanes to helicopters but was worried about fitting in with the American culture.

Trapp called former Airbus Helicopters CEO Christian Gras for advice. Gras assured him he was right for the role. “He said, ‘The way you think, the way you interact, being business-minded, your customer focus—you would fit perfectly in the U.S.,’” Trapp recalls. “We moved here, and my family and I loved it.”

Hitting Turbulence

When Trapp became CFO of Airbus Helicopters North America in August 2008, it was flying high. “We had the best results in the company and were growing like crazy,” Trapp says. Then, the economy crashed, and he was forced to go into crisis management mode less than a month into his first C-Suite post. He didn’t know it then, but each promotion he received moving forward would correspond to extreme economic hardship.

Airbus Helicopters’ North American headquarters includes production, maintenance, and pilot training facilities.

The 2008 financial crisis provided an opportunity for personal growth, Trapp says. “I had to learn the customer side of the business, because right away, I was negotiating conservation contracts with some of our customers,” he says. To know which costs to cut, he also had to master the nuances of the helicopter business model and its operations. “If you don’t know the business, what you are going to do is stupid,” he says. “It forced me to learn what makes sense and what doesn’t.” With Trapp’s help, Airbus Helicopters North America emerged from the crash even stronger. “At the end of the day, a crisis is an opportunity to be better,” he says.

He continued as CFO for four more years, helping Airbus Helicopters reach $800 million in annual revenue. “We were generating more profit and more cash while increasing market share, so it was win-win-win,” he says. The growth came in large part from the company entering the military market. It has since sold more than 465 choppers to the U.S. Army.

The conventional flight pattern for Trapp as a regional CFO would have been to return to Europe to take a larger finance role at Airbus’ global headquarters. But the customer-facing experience he gained during the financial crisis exposed him to an operations mindset he wanted to further explore. “I knew customers, and I liked it, and I was not so bad at it,” Trapp says.

But he faced a challenge; nearly all the company’s chief executives, whether they run small or large divisions within Airbus, have traditionally been engineers. What he lacked in technical knowledge, he made up for in customer relations and business savvy. “Because I got involved as a CFO into operations, understanding the business in order to support the business, I was able to check a certain number of boxes,” Trapp says.

Airbus Helicopters’ Markets

Industry leader Airbus Helicopters has worked on more than 3,070 in-service aircraft, serving a wide variety of purposes.

Here are its top revenue-producers:

The U.S Army

Hospitals

Police and Search and Rescue

Utility

Private and Business Aviation Airbus Helicopters has delivered more than 465 of its UH-72 Lakota helicopters for army missions. Choppers are produced in the company’s facility in Columbus, Mississippi; pilots are trained at Airbus Helicopters’ Fort Rucker Training Center in Alabama; and aircraft are maintained at the regional support and services hub in Grand Prairie. Airbus Helicopters is the market leader for emergency medical services helicopters. They can reach the scene of an accident three to five times faster than ground vehicles, bringing patients to medical facilities quickly and safely. Ten Airbus helicopters have been delivered to the Canadian Royal Mounted Police, more than 100 to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and many more have gone to city police and law enforcement. This segment encompasses helicopters produced for firefighting missions, power line and building maintenance efforts, oil, gas, and mining, and more. The billionaire market became the number three sales producer for Airbus in 2022 (fifth overall in revenue). Among its affluent clients is Jerry Jones, whose helicopter can often be seen at Cowboys games.

When the position of president and CEO of Airbus Helicopters’ facility in Canada opened, Trapp was offered the job, paving the way for future interdisciplinary leaders at Airbus. “Several people after that who worked with me in finance have been taking general management positions to help us all over the world,” he says. He arrived in Canada in 2013 to lead more than 250 employees in a country with the world’s second-largest helicopter fleet.

But inclement conditions surfaced within Trapp’s first year piloting as CEO: the oil price plunge of 2014 decimated the Canadian helicopter market. “Most of the helicopters flying in Canada are flying for mining and oil and gas,” he explains. Additionally, the helicopter market is often cyclical, Trapp says, and at that point, there was a downswing in demand worldwide.

Airbus Helicopters Canada’s profitability plummeted, and closing the facility became a possibility. Helicopter maintenance and parts sales provided some cash, but it wasn’t enough. Trapp’s team had to get creative. “We started thinking out of the box and said, ‘Our traditional helicopter business is going down. We know that it’s going to recover at some point. The question is, how do we survive until it recovers? Can we do something else?’” he says.

Airbus helicopters are a key transportation method and tool for law enforcement agencies, including border patrol and police officers.

A large component of Airbus Helicopters’ Canadian hub is its manufacturing facility, and Trapp’s team decided to leverage these features to make a temporary move into automotive. “We went after a contract and went into manufacturing in composite for the body of the Ford GT,” he says. “It had nothing to do with Airbus and nothing to do with helicopters, but we had the capability.”

This also allowed the leader to avoid mass layoffs and damaging morale while helping Airbus Helicopters bounce back. “Especially with a mature business, we have the tendency to become complacent,” Trapp says. “A crisis forces you to challenge yourself, but the best is to challenge yourself on a continuous basis.” Demand for law enforcement and medical helicopters in Canada recovered enough for the company to exit the automotive arena in 2018.

Halfway through his six years leading Airbus Helicopters Canada, Trapp was asked to serve as COO of Airbus Helicopters North America concurrent with his Canadian CEO role. The dip in demand that was impacting the Canadian helicopter market reached the U.S. The company needed a crisis conqueror. “It was a mix of me being ready to take on another challenge in North America and the company going through a bit of turmoil and needing to bring my experience back,” he says.

He decided to commute between Grand Prairie and Niagara Falls, searching for new markets in the U.S. the same way he did in Canada. After some thought, his team in the U.S. decided to break into the private and business aviation niche. “Basically, billionaires,” Trapp explains. “We brought a fair number of people into the helicopter business who decided to enjoy the added value of a helicopter in addition to their jet. This led us to grow our sales, and at the time, we needed to.”

He helped maintain a strong performance at both the U.S. and Canadian facilities until 2019, when he was offered the top role for North America, operating full-time out of Grand Prairie. “It was both the job I wanted and the job I had unconsciously been preparing for,” Trapp says. He accepted, then just a few months later, the COVID pandemic hit. “After the third crisis, the first thing you ask yourself is, ‘Is it me?!’” Trapp jokes.

This time, navigating a crisis meant steadying operations so that law enforcement, emergency medical services, search-and-rescue, and more could continue saving lives. Keeping composure was key. “There is a definition of leadership that I like that says: ‘A leader is someone who is importing stress and exporting energy,’” Trapp says. “Especially at a time of crisis, if you are stressed, and you show your team that you’re stressed, then the team is going to be stressed, and that’s just a recipe for failure.” Demand dropped some, but the helicopter market stabilized within the first six months of the pandemic.

Now, having navigated through three crises and driving Airbus Helicopters North America past $1 billion in revenue, Trapp has his sights set on the future—in a big way. Two of his goals for the company include capturing more government agencies as customers and improving sustainability. But another goal is a bit more eccentric. “It’s about a potentially big addition to the helicopter market, which is going to be around urban air mobility or electrical, vertical takeoff lift,” Trapp says. “In the nontechnical world—flying cars.”

Airbus’ Economic Takeoff

Airbus Helicopters North America is an aviation powerhouse.

Here are a key few stats:

The company is preparing for these autonomous and electric vehicles to become widely used in the next decade. “We are in our third round of prototypes,” Trapp says. He thinks the vehicles will serve a function similar to a taxi, shuttling people from place to place rather than replacing current uses for helicopters. “I don’t see the technology being mature enough for a while,” he says. So, what’s the next destination on Trapp’s personal flight plan? “I love this job. I always ask, ‘OK, Romain, what’s next?’ and I say, ‘I love this job,’” he laughs.

World first: Lufthansa Airbus A350 becomes climate research aircraft - newsroom.lufthansagroup.com,"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20ubHVmdGhhbnNhZ3JvdXAuY29tL2VuL3dvcmxkLWZpcnN0LWx1ZnRoYW5zYS1haXJidXMtYTM1MC1iZWNvbWVzLWNsaW1hdGUtcmVzZWFyY2gtYWlyY3JhZnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a globally unique project, the Lufthansa Group and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) are currently converting the Lufthansa Airbus A350-900 ""Erfurt"" (registration D-AIXJ) into a flying research laboratory. Now, an essential project milestone could be reached: For the first time, experts from the Lufthansa Group have attached the measuring probe system developed especially for the project to the lower fuselage of the A350 and successfully tested it in flight. Lufthansa pilots completed a flight program coordinated with the certification authorities in the airspace over southern Germany. The measuring system now being tested on the aircraft is the most complex of its kind and, in addition to the air inlet function, has sensors for high-frequency and -precision measurement of pressure and temperature. From 2024, the Airbus will collect comprehensive climate data during regular passenger flights for the European research infrastructure IAGOS-CARIBIC.

""We want to make flying more sustainable. That is why we have been supporting climate research for decades. The conversion of our Lufthansa Airbus A350 into a climate research aircraft is a globally unique project in which colleagues from a wide variety of areas at Lufthansa have been working together with partners in science for years. Our aim is to make a valuable contribution to climate research. The data that our aircraft will collect worldwide in the future will help to improve today's atmospheric and climate models and thus their informative value for the future climate on earth,"" says Jens Ritter, CEO Lufthansa Airlines.

Over the next few months, a measurement laboratory weighing around two tons and specially developed for the project will be set up. Some 20 measuring instruments will be installed in the laboratory, which will later be loaded into the cargo hold as a cargo container and connected to the measuring system on the outer fuselage of the aircraft. Next year, this high-tech laboratory will take off for the first time and collect climate data on selected flights in Lufthansa's worldwide scheduled operations. The laboratory continuously records more than 100 different trace gases, aerosol, and cloud parameters from the ground to the tropopause region at an altitude of nine to thirteen kilometers. What makes it special: Climate-relevant parameters can be recorded at this altitude with significantly higher accuracy and temporal resolution on board the aircraft than would be possible with satellite- or ground-based measurement systems.

""IAGOS-CARIBC helps to close an essential gap in our understanding of the climate system. With the high-precision measurements of many parameters, we can understand which atmospheric processes are changing and how in climate change, in an altitude region where most of the atmospheric radiation budget, i.e., the greenhouse effect, is generated and changed. We can thus identify process-specific errors and their causes in climate models and subsequently improve their predictive capabilities,"" says Dr Andreas Zahn of KIT and coordinator of IAGOS-CARIBIC. ""We are extremely grateful for Lufthansa's great commitment and support.""

The conversion of the A350 ""Erfurt"" into a research laboratory was preceded by a planning and development phase lasting several years. In addition to the Lufthansa Group and KIT, six other companies (Lufthansa Technik, Airbus, Safran, enviscope, Dynatec, and ACC COLUMBIA Jet Service) are involved in the IAGOS-CARIBIC project. The KIT also acts as coordinator of a scientific consortium of currently twelve research institutions in Europe and the USA, whose complex measuring instruments will explore the atmosphere in the flying research laboratory. The abbreviation IAGOS stands for ""In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System"" and CARIBIC for ""Civil Aircraft for the Regular Investigation of the atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container"".

The Lufthansa Group has been committed to climate and weather research for almost 30 years now and has equipped several aircraft with measuring instruments since then. From December 2004 to 2020, a Lufthansa Airbus A340-600 (registration D-AIHE) has already completed around 500 measurement flights in the service of climate and atmospheric research as part of the CARIBIC project."

Boeing outperforms Airbus in orders in Q1 2023 - AeroTime,"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvYm9laW5nLW91dHBlcmZvcm1zLWFpcmJ1cy1pbi1vcmRlcnMtaW4tcTEtMjAyM9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvYm9laW5nLW91dHBlcmZvcm1zLWFpcmJ1cy1pbi1vcmRlcnMtaW4tcTEtMjAyMy9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"While Airbus and Boeing delivered a similar number of aircraft in Q1 2023, Boeing surpassed Airbus in net orders, according to data from the manufacturer’s most recent quarterly results.

Strong delivery numbers despite pauses

While Boeing had to temporarily pause 767F deliveries, including its military derivative the KC-46A and the 787, in Q1 2023, it still managed to deliver more aircraft than Airbus.

Overall, Boeing handed over 130 aircraft to customers in Q1 2023, the majority of which (111) were the 737 MAX, the US manufacturer also delivered two P-8 Poseidon, a military derivative of the 737 NextGeneration (NG). Throughout the quarter, it also delivered 11 Boeing 787s, four 777Fs, a single 767-300F, and the last-ever 747 to Atlas Air.

The manufacturer was forced to stop the deliveries of the 767F and the KC-46A due to an issue at a supplier, which failed to follow the correct cleaning and paint adhesion procedures of the central wing fuel tank. While it was not a critical safety issue, it could have resulted in clogged fuel filters and, subsequently, restricted fuel flow to the jet’s engines.

Boeing paused deliveries of the 787 on February 23, 2023, when the planemaker announced that it had found an “analysis error by our supplier related to the 787 forward pressure bulkhead”. Deliveries were resumed in March 2023.

According to an analysis of planespotters.net data conducted by AeroTime, of the 11 Boeing 787s delivered by the OEM in Q1 2023, eight were out of inventory, having flown for several years or months prior to delivery.

Much like with deliveries, Boeing’s best-selling aircraft was the 737 MAX, with 78 orders from various airlines, including Japan Airlines and Greater Bay Airlines. EVA Air and Lufthansa ordered five and seven Boeing 787-9s, while a pair of unidentified customers finalized deals for eight 787-8 and seven 787-10 aircraft.

Finally, the United States Air Force (USAF) ordered 15 KC-46A Pegasus refuelers.

In total, Boeing booked 120 orders in Q1 2023.

Narrow-body aircraft deliveries dominate

Much like Boeing, Airbus’ deliveries and sales were dominated by narrow-body aircraft throughout the first three months of the year, including the A220 and A320neo families.

In total, Airbus delivered 127 jets in Q1 2023, namely 10 A220-30, two A319neo, 45 A320neo, and 59 A321neo. However, it delivered only 11 wide-body aircraft, split between one A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT), five A330-900neo, and five A350-900s.

Airbus’ last A220-100 delivery was in October 2022, with the European OEM also handing over its most recent A330-800neo and A350-1000 in November and December 2022, respectively. All three programs have relatively small backlogs and, as of March 2023, 37 A220-100, four A330-800neo, and 104 A350-1000s are yet to be delivered by Airbus to customers across the globe.

At the same time, throughout Q1 2023, Airbus re-added 50 A321neo and 23 A350-1000 aircraft to the backlog from Qatar Airways after the two companies solved their legal dispute over surface paint degradation on the aircraft type, while Lufthansa ordered 10 A350-1000s. However, it still did not book a single order for the A220-100 or A330neo.

Overall, Airbus added 142 (69 excluding Qatar Airways’ orders) net orders following 14 cancelations. Its best-seller was the A320neo family: The manufacturer sold one A319neo, 27 A320neo, and 60 (10 excluding Qatar Airways) A321neos. Other orders include 12 A220-300, four A350F, and five A350-900 aircraft from Delta Air Lines, presumably KLM, and British Airways, respectively.

The four A350Fs were associated with an undisclosed customer in Airbus filings. However, KLM announced that it had ordered the quartet of freighters in January 2023 to be eventually operated by its subsidiary, Martinair."
Airbus and Air France acquitted of manslaughter charges over 2009 Rio-Paris crash - EL PAÍS USA,"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL2VuZ2xpc2guZWxwYWlzLmNvbS9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLzIwMjMtMDQtMTcvYWlyYnVzLWFuZC1haXItZnJhbmNlLWFjcXVpdHRlZC1vZi1tYW5zbGF1Z2h0ZXItY2hhcmdlcy1vdmVyLTIwMDktcmlvLXBhcmlzLWNyYXNoLmh0bWzSAZkBaHR0cHM6Ly9lbmdsaXNoLmVscGFpcy5jb20vaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC8yMDIzLTA0LTE3L2FpcmJ1cy1hbmQtYWlyLWZyYW5jZS1hY3F1aXR0ZWQtb2YtbWFuc2xhdWdodGVyLWNoYXJnZXMtb3Zlci0yMDA5LXJpby1wYXJpcy1jcmFzaC5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Workers unloading debris, belonging to crashed Air France flight AF447, from the Brazilian Navy's Constitution Frigate in the port of Recife, northeast of Brazil, on June 14, 2009.

A French court on Monday acquitted Airbus and Air France of manslaughter charges over the 2009 crash of Flight 447 from Rio to Paris, prompting an outpouring of anguish from people whose loved ones were killed in a disaster that led to lasting changes in aircraft safety measures.

Some erupted in sobs, others listened in stunned silence as the presiding judge read out the decision, a devastating defeat for families of the 228 victims, who fought for 13 years to see the case reach court.

The three-judge panel ruled that there wasn’t enough evidence of a direct link between decisions by the companies and the crash. The official investigation found that multiple factors contributed to the disaster, including pilot error and the icing over of external sensors called pitot tubes.

“We are sickened. The court is telling us, ‘go on, there’s not a problem here, there’s nothing to see,’” said Danièle Lamy, who lost her son Eric in the crash and heads an association for families of victims.

“For the powerful, impunity reigns. Centuries pass, and nothing changes,” she said. “The families of victims are mortified and in total disarray.”

While the court didn’t find the companies guilty of criminal wrongdoing, the judges said that Airbus and Air France held civil responsibility for the damages caused by the crash, and ordered them to compensate families of victims. It didn’t provide an overall amount, but scheduled hearings in September to work that out.

Air France has already compensated some families of those killed, who came from 33 countries. People from around the world were among the plaintiffs.

Brazilian Nelson Faria Marinho lost his son, an engineer heading to Angola on an oil exploration job when Flight 447 crashed.

“France isn’t serious. It manufactured a killer plane and they’re covering everything else up,” said Marinho, who heads an association representing 56 Brazilian families of victims.

But he said the ruling wasn’t a surprise.

“With all the accidents, all the tragedies, the first thing they do is blame the pilot, which isn’t true. I accompanied this tragedy step by step,” he said. He described the plane as “excessively automatic. It is a killer plane and they didn’t correct it.”

Unusually, even state prosecutors argued for acquittal, saying that the two-month trial didn’t produce enough proof of criminal wrongdoing by the companies.

Prosecutors laid the blame primarily on the pilots, who died in the crash. Airbus lawyers also blamed pilot error, and Air France said the full reasons for the crash will never be known.

Air France said in a statement that the company took note of the ruling, and “will always remember the victims of this terrible accident, and express deep compassion to all of their loved ones.”

Airbus and Air France had faced potential fines of up to 225,000 euros ($219,000) each if convicted of manslaughter. That would have been just a fraction of their annual revenues, but a criminal conviction for the aviation heavyweights could have hurt their reputations and reverberated through the industry.

The A330-200 plane disappeared from radar in a storm over the Atlantic Ocean on June 1, 2009, with 216 passengers and 12 crew members aboard. It took two years to find the plane and its black box recorders on the ocean floor, at depths of more than 13,000 feet (around 4,000 meters).

An Associated Press investigation at the time found that Airbus had known since at least 2002 about problems with the type of pitot tubes used on the jet that crashed, but failed to replace them until after the crash.

Air France was accused of not having implemented training in the event of icing of the pitot probes despite the risks. Airbus was accused of not doing enough to urgently inform airlines and their crews about faults with the pilots or to ensure training to mitigate the risk.

The crash led to changes in regulations for airspeed sensors and in how pilots are trained.

The trial was fraught with emotion from the start. Distraught families shouted down the CEOs of Airbus and Air France as the proceedings opened in October, crying out “Shame!” as the executives took the stand. Dozens of people who lost loved ones stormed out of the court as the trial wrapped up with the prosecutors’ surprising call for acquittal.

“Fourteen years of legal proceedings to get here. This is a lot for us to take,” Michel Mammayou, whose daughter was aboard Flight 447, said after Monday’s verdict.

Loft Orbital Procures 15 More Satellite Buses from Airbus OneWeb Satellites - Via Satellite,"Fri, 07 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zYXRlbGxpdGV0b2RheS5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS8yMDIzLzA0LzA3L2xvZnQtb3JiaXRhbC1wcm9jdXJlcy0xNS1tb3JlLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1idXNlcy1mcm9tLWFpcmJ1cy1vbmV3ZWItc2F0ZWxsaXRlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Loft Orbital has procured a second batch of 15 satellites from Airbus OneWeb Satellites, for the bus platform based on the OneWeb satellites. Loft Orbital announced the deal April 6, saying that it sold out of the first batch ordered in January 2022.

Loft Orbital has now ordered more than 30 buses from Airbus OneWeb Satellites.

The buses will be built on the same production line as OneWeb satellites in Florida. However, Loft Orbital stated, its “Longbow” buses have some design and configuration improvements to support longer mission lifetimes and a wider range of applications, including optical missions with very high stability requirements.

Loft Orbital provides space infrastructure as a service, flying customer payloads on regularly scheduled satellites missions. The company orders flight-proven bus designs in bulk to have in inventory to quickly deploy customer missions. It also orders buses from manufacturer Leostella."
