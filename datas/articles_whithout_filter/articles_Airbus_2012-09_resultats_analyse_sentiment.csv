"Airbus unveils its ""Smarter Skies"" vision for the future of sustainable aviation - New Atlas","Sun, 09 Sep 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy11bnZlaWxzLXNtYXJ0ZXItc2tpZXMvMjQwNTUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A new report drafted by Airbus as part of its “Smarter Skies” initiative sees the aircraft manufacturing company looking toward 2050 and beyond, in order to consider what can be done to meet the expected growth in future air travel sustainably. The ambitious plans put forward include assisted take-off, free-glide landings, and aircraft flying in formation.

In the report, Airbus explains that the initial power required for a passenger plane to take-off is only needed for a brief part of the total flight. This therefore poses an opportunity for a ground-based device to provide the propulsion needed and free the plane of its additional burden. With this in mind, the engineers at Airbus came up with an idea dubbed ""eco-climb"" which appears to draw inspiration from the catapult-assisted take-off system utilized on aircraft carriers.

Airbus envisages the eco-climb system moving into position automatically and assisting passenger planes to take-off on shorter runways, with the benefit of a more rapid climb enabling aircraft to reach efficient cruising altitude quicker than before. A key concern in implementing such a design rests in keeping g-force within acceptable levels, and one can imagine such a system requiring ample stores of on-board sick bags.

The eco-climb concept would enable passenger planes to reach fuel-efficient cruising altitudes more quickly

Perhaps more practical for the somewhat near future, are the company's thoughts on landing more economically. Airbus promoted the benefits of a free-glide approach to airports, which could reduce emissions during the overall descent and limit noise too, as there would be no need for engine thrust or air breaking. However, even this idea would face a challenge to surmount current safety regulations.

Another possibility put forward concerns flying multiple aircraft in ""express skyways,"" with the use of highly sophisticated and automated aircraft navigation systems to bring passenger planes to within 20 wingspans of each other – much less than the four nautical miles which separates civil aircraft today, but still technically feasible. Just like migratory birds and military aircraft, commercial aircraft flying in a V formation would benefit from reduced drag due to the upwash from the wingtip vortices of the preceding aircraft, resulting in greater fuel efficiency.

Airbus also states that by further optimizing Air Traffic Management (ATM) systems and making better use of existing aircraft capabilities, changes in infrastructure and organization, could help reduce traffic congestion and delays, while more direct routes could cut travel times.

The company claims that flights in Europe and the U.S. could be around 13 minutes shorter on average, and flights in other parts of the world could be shorter too. Working on the assumption of approximately 30 million flights per year, the Airbus engineers worked out that such optimization could save around nine million tons of excess fuel annually, equating to over 28 million tons of avoidable CO2 emissions and a saving of five million hours of excess flight time.

While some of the plans cited in the Smarter Skies report will not be attainable for some time, if ever, optimization of existing technologies is something that could provide benefits to airlines and passengers in the near future.

A COUPLE of years ago I wrote about Airbus’s development of a concept plane, whose glossy details were published in a document called “The Future by Airbus”. That, it transpires, was just the beginning of the aeroplane-maker's mission to encourage a discussion (and show off its own ideas) about aviation in 2050. The next instalment of this futurological project, “smarter skies”, includes suggestions for changes Airbus thinks might be taking place outside the cabin.

These are five-fold:



Eco-climb – save energy by launching aircraft using an assisted-take-off mechanism. Since planes use so much power to leave the ground, the idea is to source that power from devices on the ground, rather than have them weighing down the plane. Then you could shorten the runways and lighten the aircraft, which would reach cruising altitude faster than at present.



Express skyways – planes travelling in formation (pictured), like a flock of birds, will use less energy. In Airbus's example, three aircraft heading east from Las Vegas, Los Angeles and San Francisco would meet over Utah and fly onwards together. Planes could also reduce the distances they have to fly if they take genuinely direct routes between A and B, rather than zig-zagging round different countries' airspace.



Free-glide approaches and landings – with better air-traffic management planes would be able to glide smoothly into airports, as opposed to descending in stages and wasting energy.

Ground operations – ""autonomous receiving vehicles"" that would get planes from runway to gate faster are among the ideas for improving operations at the airport.



Power - biofuels and other alternative sources of energy would reduce CO2 emissions and improve the security of energy supply.

That's a reasonable mix of the interesting and the obvious. It can be tricky with these sorts of document to avoid saying little more than ""do things better than they are done now""—and Airbus just about avoids that. Some of the ideas, such as the vehicles that help move aircraft around airports, are already with us, as this week's Economistdescribes. And if that's not enough excitement for a Friday, here is the light show with which Airbus launched this latest project in Berlin.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9951114058494568}",neutral,0.9951114058494568,0

In a delivery ceremony in Toulouse, the new aircraft was handed over to Captain Montree Jumrieng, Executive Vice President Technical at Thai, by Airbus’s Kiran Rao, Executive Vice President Sales and Marketing.

Thai, which ordered a total of six A380s, will become the ninth operator of the world’s largest commercial aircraft in early October when it launches A380 service on its Bangkok-Hong Kong and Bangkok-Singapore routes. Flights to Frankfurt, Tokyo and Paris will follow.

The three class plane is outfitted with 507 seats divided among 12 private First Class suites, 60 lie-flat Royal Silk Class seats, and 435 Economy seats. Every seat features personal in-flight entertainment systems, USB and power outlets.

Powered by four Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines, the A380’s 8,500 nm range will allow Thai to reach any destination in Europe nonstop, and reach any US city with one stop.

“With the A380 Thai will elevate its Royal Orchid Service to a new level,” said Montree Jumrieng, Thai’s Executive Vice President Technical. “In every class we are offering a new dimension in passenger appeal, from redesigned seating to the latest entertainment systems. These features, combined with the aircraft’s quiet and spacious cabin, will truly make the Thai A380 the smoothest way to fly.”

“We are extremely proud to welcome Thai as the latest operator of the A380,” said John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer, Customers. “Today Thai joins a group of world class airlines that are redefining on-board comfort while flying more efficiently.

The Smarter Skies project, unveiled this week, sets out a vision for more sustainable air travel by the year 2050. Airbus claims that by flying in a V-formation like birds, aircraft could reduce drag to cut emissions by up to 25 per cent and reduce journey times by an average 13 minutes. Formation flying would also allow air traffic control rooms to treat each flock of planes as a single entity, effectively simplifying their workload.

The project also predicts that by 2050, aircraft will be able to intelligently select the most efficient flight path according to conditions and the paths of other planes. Beyond 2050, it says, a system for assisted take-off could sling the plane into the air using motors built into the track, which would minimise noise and allow for shorter runways.

Airbus predicts that if the air traffic management systems on board aircraft were successfully optimised, the aviation sector would save 9 million tonnes of fuel a year and 28 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.

The project illustrations show a conceptual aeroplane by Airbus that we reported on last year, with longer, slimmer wings and onboard entertainment including a virtual golf course.

Airbus predicts catapult takeoffs and formation flying by 2050 - The Register,"Fri, 07 Sep 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS8yMDEyLzA5LzA3L2FpcmJ1c19zbWFydGVyX3NraWVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has detailed its plans for the future of air travel in 2050, when megacities and rising fuel costs will make flying a very different kettle of (flying) fish.

The company's ""Smarter Skies"" report has been two years in the making, using interviews within the aviation industry and with designers to come up with radical new aircraft and infrastructure designed to cope with the future cost of fuel and the limits placed on airports by the growth of megacities.

""Our engineers are continuously encouraged to think widely and come up with 'disruptive' ideas which will assist our industry in meeting the 2050 targets we have signed up to,"" said Charles Champion, Airbus VP of engineering in a statement.

""These and the other tough environmental targets will only be met by a combination of investment in smarter aircraft design and optimizing the environment in which the aircraft operates. That is why our latest Future by Airbus Smarter Skies concepts focus on not just what we fly but, how we may fly in 2050 and beyond.""

Aircraft will become totally recyclable, the report predicts, using interior fittings that are grown from vegetable matter and which will be self-cleaning and repairing. Bulkheads could be made of materials that can become transparent – which might cause some people with a fear of heights some problems – and the wings could change and adapt to different wind conditions for maximum efficiency.

Advances in design and materials science will make aircraft engines much more reliable and reduce the need for servicing, so they can be built into the hull of the aircraft for maximum aerodynamic efficiency. Airbus predicts that with the right incentives, biofuel will be used for 30 per cent of flights by 2030, which could rise to 50 per cent by 2050. Solar power and fuel cells could also augment the engines.

In 2050, flying begins with flinging

Once you're on board and strapped in, Airbus proposes that the energy needed to get you aloft could be cut drastically by using a catapult systems similar to that used on aircraft carriers today. This ""renewably powered, propelled acceleration"" system would be low-G enough for everyday travelers and would allow for shorter runways to save space – although the graphic of the takeoff angle suggests a lot of spilled drinks and freefalling cabin crew.

'Our cabin crew will be passing along the plane at freefall speeds' (click to enlarge)

Once aloft the aircraft will use predictive software to work out the most fuel-efficient route to its objective, and on busy flight paths aircraft would be coordinated to fly in formation to save fuel, just as birds and military aircraft do. The air vortices from the wings of the lead craft will provide free lift for those aircraft following, although the risk of collision might unnerve some passengers.

Taking a tip from the animal kingdom (click to enlarge)

In order to save yet more energy and reduce noise pollution, Airbus suggests allowing planes to power down their engines well before landing and glide onto the runway on momentum alone. This is possible today: in 2001 an Airbus A330-243 ran out of fuel mid-Atlantic and glided over 60 miles to land in the Azores. Aviation authorities, however, insist on powered landing for safety reasons.

It is possible that future landings will also be more complex. Airbus postulates that aircraft could land directly on a moving platform which would then shuttle it off the runway and to the airport building without needing to restart the engines. Since this would require every aircraft and airport to be outfitted with such a system, the European plane manufacturer admits this is quite a long shot.

All this futuristic stuff is good enough for 2050, but Airbus says significant savings could be made right now using currently available technology. Airbus estimates that if the current crop of air traffic management systems were properly used, the average flight time would be 13 minutes shorter and the industry could save nine million tons of fuel a year. ®","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9050775170326233}",neutral,0.9050775170326233,0

Credit: Airbus

(Phys.org)—Toulouse-based Airbus, a world-leading aircraft manufacturer, has issued its ""vision"" of what truly smart flying—smart, that is, as in sustainable rather than smart as in sensor-packed—will be like in 2050. The presentation is designed to address making passenger flying more comfortable, safer, more reliable, and, as key, to address the need to curb aviation emissions that pollute the environment. In all, Airbus has ideas for sustainable aviation in 2050 and beyond. If global air transport is to grow as projected, the company knows there is work ahead to cut emissions and institute ways that flying can be less burdensome to the environment. They are suggesting ways to minimize noise, reduce fuel emissions and potentially shorten flight times.

One such step foresees a new method for takeoff, with renewably powered propelled acceleration that allows aircraft to climb steeper and reach cruise altitude faster. They have suggested a propelled platform with its own set of wheels under the plane's fuselage that could boost acceleration before detaching just before takeoff.

In approaching airports, Airbus also suggested the plans could glide towards the airports using a steeper approach than usual as an alternative to the use of engine thrust and air brakes.

Their presentation looks at slowing aircraft at earlier stages and making shorter landing distances possible. Using shorter runways would mean less land use, also in the name of going green, or in the words of an Airbus statement, ""as space becomes a premium and mega-cities become a reality.""

Formation flights along “express skyways” – the full benefits of which are highlighted by Airbus’ Smarter Skies campaign – could reduce drag and expend less energy by up to 15 per cent. Credit: Airbus

Airbus further suggests that flying in formation be used to cut air drag and boost fuel efficiency. ""High frequency routes would allow aircraft to benefit from flying in formation like birds during cruise bringing efficiency improvements due to drag reduction and lower energy use,"" according to the Vision statement.

Airbus executive vice president of engineering, Charles Champion, said ""We know people want to fly more in the future and our forecasts support this. We also know that they don't want to fly at any cost.""

A key feature of Airbus’ Smarter Skies campaign is the use of a continuous “eco-climb” during takeoff, which will help increase capacity at constrained megacities/airports. Credit: Airbus

Fuel is a key topic in the Airbus' proposal; Airbus says it is already working on development and use of alternative fuels. ""The use of sustainable biofuels and other potential alternative energy sources (such as electricity, hydrogen, solar etc) will be necessary to secure supply and further reduce aviation's environmental footprint in the long term,"" said Airbus. This would allow an extensive introduction of regionally sourced renewable energy close to airports, the company added, feeding aircraft sustainably.

When you look at Airbus stats, it is easy to see that numbers in tons of excess fuel and avoidable CO2 emissions suggest that efforts to come up with smarter moves are needed. According to Airbus, if the Air Traffic Management system and technology on board the aircraft were optimized, then flights in Europe and the US could on average be around 13 minutes shorter, and flights in other parts of the world could be shorter too. Assuming around 30 million flights per year, this would save around 9 million tons of excess fuel annually, which equates to over 28 million tons of avoidable CO2 emissions and, for passengers, a saving of 5 million hours of excess flight time.

Starting with the basic structure, the ""concept plane"" was an attempt to imagine what might come to be if materials and aerodynamic ideas could be combined into a sort of ""engineer's dream"".

Airbus readily admitted that the result was ""a package of technologies that are unlikely ever to coexist in such a manner"". The package was pretty - ultra-long and slim wings, semi-embedded engines, a U-shaped tail - but not especially radical as visions of the future go.

Far more thought-provoking fare came a year later. On the eve of the 2011 Paris air show, Airbus fleshed out some more radical notions of the passenger-aircraft interface, particularly inside the cabin.

Imagine, for example, an aircraft built of intelligent membranes that turn from opaque to transparent on command, to do away with windows and provide a panoramic view of the sky. Enhanced reality projection could add to the scene, or even turn it into images tailored to suit each passenger. Indeed, Airbus imagines palm-recognition check-in, so the aircraft would know each passenger intimately and, thanks to its smart materials and neural networks, be able to learn their preferences for, say, cabin lighting, or even seat shape.

Other ideas may be less esoteric. Bionic-inspired structures that mimic birds' bones - strong where needed and light everywhere else - are already on the drawing board, and energy-harvesting techniques to capture passengers' body heat to power onboard systems are already in use in the Stockholm metro.

Hydrogen fuel cells could provide emission-free onboard electric power while on the ground, while solar panels on the wings and fuselage could be another way to provide some onboard power.

Also probably much closer than 2050 are self-repairing materials that would help keep a cabin in as-new condition. Fully recyclable plant fibres could replace many non-renewable materials used today.

OPERATIONS

Now, with a more careful look at how savings - particularly of fuel - may be found in operations, Airbus has perhaps opened the most interesting aspect of what it hopes will be a wide-ranging debate over the future of air travel. As some of its latest ideas could conceivably be put into practice with little modification of the existing aircraft fleet, it may not be necessary to wait decades for their realisation.

Least controversial among what Airbus executive vice-president engineering Charles Champion describes as ""disruptive ideas"" needed to spur aviation towards its goal of halving carbon emissions by 2050 are two concepts for greater on-the-ground efficiency. One involves using navigation technology to optimise an aircraft's actual landing position, so that an autonomous - and renewably powered - taxi tug could be waiting. The result could be that aircraft could switch off engines sooner but still be quickly pulled off runways, to optimise terminal space and remove runway and gate limitations.

Another is to create regional supplies of sustainable biofuels and energy sources ranging from hydrogen to solar electricity to power airports and aircraft.

Also not wildly futuristic are free-glide approaches and landings, which may be seen as an extension of the so-called 4D flights along optimum paths already being trialled and which are widely held to be possible if next-generation air traffic management systems are put in place. The purpose would be to remain in cruise altitude efficiency for longer, and reduce noise and emissions during approach by taking a steeper descent without engine thrust or air braking.

Airbus

Free-glide approaches would, Champion believes, also reduce landing speed - which would translate into shorter runways.

Also intriguing is Airbus's notion of formation flying. The concept is not new, but, as Champion explains, it may not take a great leap to realisation. Champion estimates that by riding in another aircraft's slipstream at a distance of about 1nm (1.85km), fuel burn could be reduced by 10-15% - about what might be expected by introducing the engines currently under development by Pratt & Whitney and CFM International to replace their popular V2500 and CFM56 narrowbody models around the middle of the decade.

He stresses that there is no question of attempting to maintain formations near airports; the idea only applies during flight in a ""stable trajectory""; for example, over the ocean. And, he says, safety comes first, so for an aircraft to join a queue would always be a pilot-controlled manoeuvre.

Rather more daunting is an idea for assisted take-off. As Airbus presents it, aircraft would be propelled to take-off speed partly by their own engines and partly by a tractor (renewably powered, of course). The result would be quicker acceleration on shorter runways and steeper climb to cruise; aircraft could carry smaller engines, too, saving fuel all around.

What happens to these tractors when they reach the end of the runway at take-off speed, however, is one of those details that still needs to be worked out.

""In 20 years from now, China's domestic passenger traffic will overtake the US domestic traffic to become the number one traffic flow in our forecast,"" Leahy maintained.

He added that there would be strong demand for more fuel-efficient aircraft, with about 10,300 passenger planes expected to be replaced by ""greener"" models.

Airbus hopes it will profit most from growing demand worldwide. Last year, the company - a division of European aerospace giant EADS - logged orders for 1,419 planes, compared with rival Boeing's 805.

Air travel in 2050: Autonomous planes flying in geese-like formations - ExtremeTech,"Fri, 14 Sep 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4dHJlbWV0ZWNoLmNvbS9leHRyZW1lLzEzNTc3NC1haXItdHJhdmVsLWluLTIwNTAtYXV0b25vbW91cy1wbGFuZXMtZmx5aW5nLWluLWdlZXNlLWxpa2UtZm9ybWF0aW9uc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"One day in the not-so-distant future, semi-autonomous airplanes will fly through the skies like flocks of geese, reducing drag and saving fuel. This concept is part of a broader plan by airplane maker Airbus to modernize the industry over the next three decades.

""Our engineers are continuously encouraged to think widely and come up with 'disruptive' ideas which will assist our industry in meeting the 2050 targets we have signed up to,"" Airbus' engineering chief Charles Champion says. ""These and the other tough environmental targets will only be met by a combination of investment in smarter aircraft design and optimising the environment in which the aircraft operates.""

While planes presently fly with about 1,000 feet (300m) of vertical separation between them, computer-controlled planes could fly much closer. The planes' flight control systems could also ingest weather and atmospheric conditions and adjust to constantly fly the best available route, while at the same time maintaining a safe distance from other nearby planes.

This all may sound like an attempt at removing the pilot from the flying process, but Airbus cautions that is not the case.

The pilot is still in control of the aircraft, but the enhanced computer system will act as a backup, smoothing out the natural pilot error. Flying in such close formation obviously requires precision, far more than even the most experienced pilot can provide. Accidents and issues do happen, so Airbus sees it as important for the pilot to still have control. The goal here is efficiency, and the company's research shows that's exactly what such a system provides.

On average, thanks to reduced air resistance -- just like a flock of geese flying in a V formation -- flights will be about 13 minutes shorter, and about 9 million tons of aircraft fuel will be saved. Billions of dollars a year will be saved in fuel costs, which hopefully would have the effect of making air travel cheaper too. There's also an environmental benefit here: 28 million less tons of CO2 emissions would be put into our atmosphere each year.

Besides the more advanced computer systems in planes, Airbus has other concepts(Opens in a new window) that it plans to test, and has set a goal of the year 2050 to deploy these technologies.

In addition to computer controlled flying, Airbus proposes a superfast ground vehicle to launch aircraft into the sky, and free glides into airports. In both cases, this would require much less runway, which means airports could be constructed in highly-populated areas where land comes at a premium. Another time and fuel saving measure is optimizing the taxiing of planes around the airport, by using robotic taxi vehicles powered on renewable energy.

Champion says that while Airbus is serious about making air travel more efficient and cost effective, his company will not be able to do it alone. ""The future of sustainable aviation is the sum of many parts and success will require collaboration amongst all the parties who are passionate about ensuring a successful prospect for aviation,"" he says.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9485095739364624}",positive,0.9485095739364624,1

The faster a plane can get in the air, the less noise it makes overhead and the sooner it reaches cruise altitudes, where flight is more efficient.

To accelerate takeoff without sacrificing aircraft size, Airbus is working on a renewably powered rolling platform that will tow the plane, so it hits the required speed to get airborne more quickly than if powered only by its own engines.

But it's actually not an entirely new idea—fighter jets already take off from aircraft carriers with the help of a catapult built into the deck.

It allows for shorter runways, obviously important on carriers at sea, and potentially at airports Airbus predicts may soon be pressed for space by expanding cities.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9829002022743225}",positive,0.9829002022743225,1

The airframer will conduct its first display routine with a sharklet-equipped A320 when MSN5098 carries out a demonstration at the ILA show, rehearsals for which were performed yesterday.

Its routine involves a 180kt (330km/h) steep climb to 1,500ft (460m) before a sharp turn back to the display area and a 360˚ orbit at 1,000ft. The A320 then returns and descends to 600ft to execute a slow pass at 120kt, with gear up, before climbing to 2,200ft and turning to land. Test pilots Christophe Cail and Martin Scheuermann will be crewing the jet.

MSN5098 is a CFM International CFM56-powered twinjet but Airbus also began testing an International Aero Engines V2500-equipped version, bearing Qatar Airways colours, in July.

Tests with these aircraft have been complementing the early flight-test campaign with the MSN1 A320 testbed.

Sharklets are intended to shave 3.5% off fuel-burn over longer sectors. They will enter service on CFM56-equipped A320s from the fourth quarter of this year and on the V2500 aircraft from the first quarter of 2013, although Airbus has yet to disclose which customers will be the first to receive them.

Airbus says it plans to put the first sharklet-fitted A321 into the programme in autumn.

It expects to perform 250h of tests, lasting some five months, carrying out back-to-back assessments with the regular wing-tip fence variant because the A321's wing structure differs from the A320's.

Sharklet-equipped A321s will be test-flown with both engine options and both types will enter service in the third quarter of 2013.

""We need to certify individually every combination of aircraft model and engine selection,"" says the airframer.

Testing of the modified A319 will be shorter, running to 120h, with the CFM56 version becoming available in the second quarter of 2013. The V2500 variant will follow in the third quarter, while the A318 - being tested for 90h, and only with CFM56 engines - will enter service in the fourth.

Airbus Sets New Targets for How Flight Should Look by 2050 - The Green Optimistic,"Wed, 12 Sep 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVub3B0aW1pc3RpYy5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXNtYXJ0ZXItc2tpZXMtMjA1MC0yMDEyMDkxMi_SAUdodHRwczovL3d3dy5ncmVlbm9wdGltaXN0aWMuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1zbWFydGVyLXNraWVzLTIwNTAtMjAxMjA5MTIvP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As aviation is nowadays one of the top polluters, aircraft manufacturer Airbus is now sharing their thoughts on how aviation should look by 2050. They devised a handful of measures that should be taken to regulate how fleets should be operated in the most sustainable way possible.

Therefore, they described all of their engineers’ ideas and concepts in the latest Future by Airbus Smarter Skies. For example, if the Air Traffic Management and the onboard technology would be upgraded, around 9 million tons of fuel could be saved annually, which would in turn save over 28 million tons of CO2 emitted into the air. That translates into 5 million less spent in the air (per year). That is a staggering 570 years, the lives of 8 people living up to an average of 70.

The Smarter Skies vision contains five concepts.

Quoting Airbus, these are:

Aircraft take-off in continuous ‘eco-climb’ Also read: This Device Extends Your Phone's Battery Lifespan Like Nothing Else. 5% Discount Code: GREENOPT Aircraft launched through assisted take-offs using renewably powered, propelled acceleration, allowing steeper climb from airports to minimise noise and reach efficient cruise altitudes quicker.

As space becomes a premium and mega-cities become a reality, this approach could also minimise land use, as shorter runways could be utilised. Aircraft in free flight and formation along ‘express skyways’ Highly intelligent aircraft would be able to “self-organise” and select the most efficient and environmentally friendly routes (“free flight”), making the optimum use of prevailing weather and atmospheric conditions.

High frequency routes would also allow aircraft to benefit from flying in formation like birds during cruise bringing efficiency improvements due to drag reduction and lower energy use. Low-noise, free-glide approaches and landings Aircraft allowed to take free glide approaches into airports that reduce emissions during the overall decent and reduce noise during the steeper approach as there is no need for engine thrust or air breaking.

These approaches would also reduce the landing speed earlier which would make shorter landing distances achievable (less runway needed). Low emission ground operations On landing aircraft engines could be switched off sooner and runways cleared faster, ground handling emissions could be cut.

Technology could optimise an aircraft’s landing position with enough accuracy for an autonomous renewably powered taxiing carriage to be ready, so aircraft could be transported away from runways quicker, which would optimise terminal space, and remove runway and gate limitations. Powering future aircraft and infrastructure The use of sustainable biofuels and other potential alternative energy sources (such as electricity, hydrogen, solar etc) will be necessary to secure supply and further reduce aviation’s environmental footprint in the long term. This will allow the extensive introduction of regionally sourced renewable energy close to airports, feeding both aircraft and infrastructure requirements sustainably.

Along with these measures, the implementation of electric motors is still an optimistic thought that’s still in its infancy. However, it could be achieved once the electric car industry is put in place and cheaper/better batteries are invented.

One way or another, Airbus already predicts (and hopes) that people will fly more in the future and this should encourage all kinds of cleaner technologies to emerge, just to reduce costs and increase safety.

A total of 82 A380s have been delivered, including the entire complement ordered by initial customer Singapore Airlines.

A380 marketing head Richard Carcaillet says the retrofit improvements lifted the fleet's dispatch reliability rate by a percentage point, to 99.3%, from the beginning of 2012.

The improvement has been notable during the course of delivery of the past 25 aircraft, he says.

Modifications have been made to systems such as landing-gear door sensors which, he says, were ""a bit too twitchy"" as well as fuel pumps, electro-hydraulic actuators and door systems.

While the retrofit actions have been ""nothing spectacular"", Carcaillet says they have made a large difference to the type's operational statistics. ""For weeks on end [the A380s] just fly, fly, fly,"" he says.

Carcaillet insists the wing-rib bracket cracking issue is not responsible for a dip in A380 sales because the airframer is marketing slots for 2015, beyond the date by which the problem will be resolved.

Airbus admits the target of 30 orders for 2012 is looking increasingly tough to meet, but Carcaillet says there are several ""good campaigns"" under way in Asia, Europe and the USA, with interest equally split between new and existing customers.

He points out that the increasing integration of airline networks through alliances means more passengers are being connected to the A380 on their journeys.

""Every airline that wants to fly in this game at network level has to be looking at the A380,"" he says. Carcaillet claims carriers are ""taking time to look around to see what other airlines are doing"", and he believes a domino effect will result once the interest converts into orders.

Other ambitious plans that could improve the holiday flight include steeper take-offs to reduce journey times and gentler, glide-in landings to improve noise problems and emissions.

Airbus added that by the middle of the 21st century flights in Europe and the USA could on average be around 13 minutes shorter, saving around nine million tonnes of fuel a year.

And highly-intelligent aircraft would be able to 'self-organise' selecting the most efficient and environmentally-friendly routes.

The shorter flights would lead to the saving of more than 28 million tonnes of avoidable C0 2 emissions a year as well as the saving of five million flying hours.

Airbus engineering executive vice president Charles Champion said: 'Our engineers are continuously encouraged to think widely and come up with ‘disruptive’ ideas which will assist our industry in meeting the 2050 targets we have signed up to.

'These and the other tough environmental targets will only be met by a combination of investment in smarter aircraft design and optimising the environment in which the aircraft operates.



'That is why our latest Future by Airbus Smarter Skies concepts focus on not just what we fly, but how we may fly in 2050 and beyond.

"Sharklets on an A320 Significantly Cut Fuel Consumption, Says Airbus - Softpedia News","Wed, 12 Sep 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5zb2Z0cGVkaWEuY29tL25ld3MvU2hhcmtsZXRzLW9uLWFuLUEzMjAtU2lnbmlmaWNhbnRseS1DdXQtRnVlbC1Db25zdW1wdGlvbi1TYXlzLUFpcmJ1cy0yOTE2NDQuc2h0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As we previously reported, Airbus has long been making significant efforts towards cutting down the ecological footprint of the aviation industry, either by promoting the use of more environmentally-friendly plane fuels, or by making sure no precious resources are wasted when one aircraft is sent flying from one place to another.

Recent news on this topic informs us that, after carrying out several tests on an A320 fully equipped with innovative sharklets, engineers working with this company found that significant savings have been made in terms of fuel consumption.

More precisely, the official website for Airbus states that fuel consumption was reduced by as much as 3.5% - 4% without this having any consequences on the aircraft's ability to navigate the skies.

John Leahy, presently employed as chief operating officer for Airbus, made a case of how, “These new fuel-saving wingtip devices represent the next phase in our ongoing development of the best-selling A320 Family.”

He further explained that, “They will bring significant reduction in fuel burned: at least 3.5 per cent; in fact, our engineers are telling me that with the flight tests we're completing now, it's closer to 4 per cent.”

Moreover, these sharklets are expected to improve the plane's takeoff performance, and thus contribute even further to cutting down on the amounts of harmful emissions released by the aviation industry on a yearly basis.

In case anyone was wondering, it seems that, should all aircrafts soon be equipped with such devices, each and every one of them will cut its CO2 emission by about 1,000 tons on a yearly basis.

From where we stand, this is good news indeed, especially given the fact that air transportation is presently regarded by most people as one of the most efficient means of getting from one place to another.

Therefore, greening up this particular branch of the transportation industry stands to yield significant benefits in terms of environmental protection.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9934594631195068}",positive,0.9934594631195068,1
"Supersizing the superjumbo: Airbus says 1,000 seat A380 due 2020 - Executive Traveller","Wed, 26 Sep 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vc3VwZXJzaXppbmctdGhlLXN1cGVyanVtYm8tMS0wMDAtc2VhdC1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1kdWUtYnktMjAyMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus says that its upsized A380, capable of carrying up as many as 1,000 passengers, remains on the drawing board for launch in 2020.

Known as the A380-900, it's a big brother to the original A380-800 but was shelved in May 2010 due to soft demand for a supersized superjumbo.

""We have a design for the A380-900 which can be reactivated at the appropriate time"" Bob Lange, Airbus vice-president of marketing for the A380, told Australian Business Traveller.

""My best estimate of that appropriate time at the moment would probably be (to enter service) at the beginning of the next decade.""

Airbus is concentrating its energies on building the A380, Lange says, ""and at the high end of the market we are not seeing the strength of demand to launch that product.""

The A380-900 will carry at least 100 more passengers than current A380-800, with 650 passengers in a standard multi-class configuration and over 900 passengers if filled with with economy-only seating.

(Lufthansa and Air France-KLM had reportedly expressed interest in a 1,000 seat version, which is a lot of middle seats!)

TheA380-900 is essentially a stretched version of the A380-800, measuring 79.4m from tip to tail -- 6.4m (the length of a shipping container) more than today's A380.

Airbus executive vice president Tom Williams says that expanding the already huge A380-800 to even larger variants was the plan from the start.

“I lead the team that designed the wings of the A380, and (when she first saw the models) even my good lady wife was quick to point out that the wings are very big in comparison to the fuselage” Williams told Australian Business Traveller earlier this year.

“The wings are in fact designed for a much larger airplane, so we have the capability of going to a bigger fuselage – we can stretch the fuselage very easily.”

""And we have airlines today who tell us they love the A380 but it’s too small! Now it’s not an engineering issue – we can make it bigger – it’s more a question of what would be a good business case and where the market for this is.""

These supersized aircraft are central to Airbus' belief that the global travel market will settle on ""mega-hubs"" for long-haul travel – each of which will cater to more than 10,000 passengers per day – with other destinations being reached by transfers.

And according to Airbus, those mega-hubs will demand a mega-sized A380 to provide enough seats.

High-end negotiator: How did she get there? - Gulf News,"Tue, 25 Sep 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZ3VsZm5ld3MuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9oaWdoLWVuZC1uZWdvdGlhdG9yLWhvdy1kaWQtc2hlLWdldC10aGVyZS0xLjEwODA4MzTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Name Celine Bouas

Age 34

Nationality French

Job Celine is a sales contracts director for Airbus, meaning she negotiates the sale

of Airbus aircraft to airlines. When she isn’t writing up billion-dollar deals (literally), she

is flying all over the world meeting high-flying airline execs.

I followed my passion...

“I’ve always been interested in aviation and space travel. When I was ten years old, I won a trip on Airbus’ first A320. I was fascinated by the aviation industry from then on. I didn’t want to be an engineer though, so at university I studied air and space law and finance instead. After university, I had the choice to work in the industry, or to earn a lot more money working as a lawyer. My dad said, ‘It’s not about the money. It’s about doing a job you are passionate about.’ And he was right. A lot of people in my industry are as passionate as I am. I’d say 80 per cent of us are verging on being geeks.”

I’m a woman in a man’s world...

“Sometimes I find myself in environments that are not comfortable for women. Other times there’s an awkward question mark on everyone’s faces when I walk into a room and I know I have to say something smart quickly so they start listening to what I say, rather than looking at who I am. I call this ‘the power of knowledge’ – if you know your stuff, they’ll forget who you are.”

To do my job...

“In my line of work, you need to have a lot of energy – and you need to be flexible and innovative, as each deal is different. You also need to have a high level of ethics, determination and strength. And if you’re married, or engaged, having an understanding partner is essential.”



It’s high stress, but high reward...

“I don’t think of the price tag of the deal when I’m in the middle of a negotiation. But when I’m lying awake at night, thinking of the huge loss to the company if I make a mistake, it hits me. But the moment the deal is signed, I feel so excited and so proud. Then there’s a big celebration and it’s in the papers and there’s so much hype... it feels like you’ve just finished your final university exams. I love that feeling.”

My advice to others would be...

“Know everything there is to know about your profession so you can add value to a conversation. If I want people to trust my opinion professionally, I need to know what I am talking about. I also think it’s very important to know the priorities of your manager. If you can help your boss achieve their goals, it will reflect well on you.”

I take inspiration from...

“Many pilots from the early years of aviation, for their courage, sense of adventure and dreams. As for a living role model, I would say Christine Lagarde, who heads up the International Monetary Fund. She is a French woman who really has made a career in a man’s world – in the world of French governmental politics. She achieved this through her determination and her competencies, but she stayed feminine and she is the mother of two children. In French we say, ‘Chapeau!’, which means, ‘Hats off to her!’”

Job joys

“I love the common passion I share with my colleagues. I’ve seen adults crying when one of their satellites is launched into space. I always think it must be the best industry ever.”



“I love the travelling. I thought I would eventually get bored of it, but I enjoy meeting people from all over the world and being inspired by them.”



“I find the intellectual side of putting a deal together exciting. The creation and the strategy... the more complex, the better.”

Work woes

“The feeling that you are taking a big risk without a safety net. Sometimes I wake up in the morning with a scared feeling in my stomach – but, at the same time, you need the adrenaline as that powers you through the intense negotiating period.”



“After closing a deal, the admin of drafting it up is a low point for me.” “Filling in my expenses sheet after a business trip away.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9967196583747864}",neutral,0.9967196583747864,0
"Flying Magnotta on a private jet? It might have saved us over $200,000 - Maclean's","Mon, 17 Sep 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbWFjbGVhbnMuY2EvbmV3cy9jYW5hZGEvZmx5aW5nLW1hZ25vdHRhLW9uLWEtcHJpdmF0ZS1qZXQtaXQtbWlnaHQtaGF2ZS1zYXZlZC11cy1vdmVyLTIwMDAwMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The next time Canadian authorities have to extradite a high-profile fugitive from a distant country, I suggest they do a little comparison shopping first.

I’m referring, of course, to the $375,000 (and counting) tab for getting accused cannibal killer/dismemberment murderer Luka Rocco Magnotta back to Canada from Germany in June.

Part of the bill was for hotel accommodation and “catering” in Montreal and Berlin for the eight Canadian public employees (two military flight crew members and six Montreal police officers) who flew to Germany and returned with a ninth Canadian, the aforementioned Magnotta. Those expenses are not wildly unreasonable, although the $2,000 bill for “catering” in Berlin works out to $250 per Canadian public employee—a little steep for dinner and breakfast when you consider they were in Berlin for 12 hours. Maybe box lunches for the return flight were thrown in by the caterers as well. Who knows.

The hospitality expenses are mere chicken feed, however, compared to the $370,570 transportation bill taxpayers are apparently being dinged with for the expedition.

A look at the hourly price tag:

According to federal documents obtained by the Canadian Press under the Access to Information Act, that $370,570 total is based on an estimated operating hourly rate of $15,505 assessed by the Royal Canadian Air Force for 23.9 hours of flight time logged by the Airbus CC-150 Polaris aircraft employed in the venture.

Now, that seems awfully high to me for a round trip across the Atlantic. I’ll be making the same journey in less than a week for somewhere closer to $400 return (when you knock off taxes). It just doesn’t make sense that it would cost almost 1,000 times as much to fly Luka Magnotta across the same body of water.

At the time arrangements were being made to extradite Magnotta, the Globe and Mail quoted a Montreal police spokeswoman saying, “We made checks and there was no interest from commercial airlines.”

Apparently the necessity to clear out “a complete section” of a commercial airliner to accommodate the accused killer and his guards was just too much to contemplate. (Not naming any particular Canadian airline, but I’ve been on trans-Atlantic flights where the entire business-class compartment could be freed up by moving two or three people up to first class.)

But even if a regular commercial flight was out, why the gargantuan leap to a military Airbus at the cost of $15,505 an hour?

According to the documents CP unearthed, the request for military help came from Public Safety Canada, the federal government’s catchall law enforcement department headed by Minister Vic Toews.

Did Public Safety ever consider renting private aircraft instead?

Just to put my fevered mind at rest, I checked how much that would have cost for the same flight earlier today.

There are plenty of private jet charters out there, but the one I used was PrivateFly, a British company that acts as a clearinghouse for 7,000 charter aircraft worldwide and says it can arrange “the best available private aircraft at the most competitive, transparent market price” within 90 minutes.

Looking through the list of long-range jets offered by PrivateFly, I settled on a Gulfstream 350, which, the website states, “has the ability to carry 8 passengers, travel 3800 nautical miles at Mach 0.8 and cruise at 45,000 feet. It can handle domestic jaunts and transcontinental flights with equal ease.”

The Gulfstream 350 was actually built to accommodate 13 passengers, but PrivateFly’s version obviously gives you a little more legroom — an important feature if you’re wearing manacles and legirons, I would think.

Montreal to Berlin is within the Gulfstream 350’s range on a tank of gas and its 410-knot speed (that’s about 758 km an hour) would make it an eight-hour flight, give or take an hour (depending on weather and headwinds).

And the price?

According to Private Fly, the average cost is $7,030 per flying hour.

That’s a big step back from $15,505 an hour.

I’m sure there are add-ons and other costs to factor in, but nothing that would come close to doubling the cost of the charter.

Flying hours:

Another puzzling question are the flying hours that are being billed to Canadian taxpayers on account of the military Airbus.

Even if you want to make the flight time between Berlin and Montreal 10 hours each way just to be on the safe side, you’re talking a $140,000 bill—not a $370,000 bill. (Just imagine the police overtime that could be paid with that extra $230,000!)

The 23.9 hours of flying time billed by the RCAF for its Airbus included flight time from Cold Lake, Alberta, to Montreal before the trans-Atlantic hop and from Montreal to Trenton, Ontario, after the delivery, according to the documents obtained by CP.

Now, the RCAF’s five converted Airbus transports—including the VIP version used to extradite Magnotta—are operated by 437 Squadron based at CFB Trenton. So I’m not really sure why the Department of National Defence would get to charge for the Cold Lake-Montreal leg of the journey when the aircraft’s home base is within spitting distance of Montreal (in aviation terms).

Picking up the bill:

And who exactly will pay for all this? It will be interesting to see.

The parties involved seem to be Service de police de la Ville de Montreal (which headed the murder investigation and sent six members of its force to Berlin to get Magnotta), Surete de Quebec (because they were involved in the overall Magnotta investigation and fugitive hunt), the RCMP (because Magnotta is charged with mailing body parts and criminally harassing Stephen Harper and other Members of Parliament), Public Safety Canada, the Department of National Defence and the Attorney General of Canada (because he is responsible for international extraditions, according to the Extradition Act of 1999).

My suspicion is that, after a certain amount of horse trading, Harper will tell the various federal departments involved to each pick up a share of the transportation tab, while the Montreal police will foot the bill for the six officers’ overtime and victualing in Berlin.

If there’s one bright spot in all this—apart from the important fact that Luka Magnotta is back in a Canadian jail cell and preparing for trial in a few months—it’s that the Canadian military is apparently learning how to pay for itself.

It’s too much to think the forces will actually become a profit centre, but profit margin now seems to be as relevant as mission when it comes to strategic planning.

Can the day of the $748 pliers (U.S. Air Force) and the $640 toilet seat (U.S. Navy) be far away for the RCAF and Royal Canadian Navy?","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999914169311523}",neutral,0.9999914169311523,0
Smarter Skies project offers a vision of air travel in 2050 - Metro.co.uk,"Mon, 24 Sep 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vbWV0cm8uY28udWsvMjAxMi8wOS8yNC9zbWFydGVyLXNraWVzLXByb2plY3Qtb2ZmZXJzLWEtdmlzaW9uLW9mLWFpci10cmF2ZWwtaW4tMjA1MC01ODg0NDgv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly9tZXRyby5jby51ay8yMDEyLzA5LzI0L3NtYXJ0ZXItc2tpZXMtcHJvamVjdC1vZmZlcnMtYS12aXNpb24tb2YtYWlyLXRyYXZlbC1pbi0yMDUwLTU4ODQ0OC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Planes taking off from moving runways and flying in formation like geese may be the future of aviation.

Outside the black box: Airbus’ plans for the future include moving runway platforms to aid take-off and transparent aircraft cabins

Should we feel guilty about flying? Greenpeace says air travel creates ten times the pollution of an equivalent train journey. It’s dirty, noisy and – with rising fuel prices and air taxes – increasingly expensive.

All of this has led aircraft manufacturer Airbus to ask some pretty searching questions. Its Smarter Skies project is a vision of air travel in 2050. The company’s engineers are putting their faith in rapid take-offs, glided landings, renewable biofuels and – weirdest of all – planes flying in formation, like a flock of geese.

Charles Champion, head of engineering at Airbus, says: ‘Our engineers are continuously encouraged to think widely and come up with “disruptive” ideas which will assist our industry in meeting the 2050 targets we have signed up to.

‘These and the other tough environmental targets will only be met by a combination of smarter aircraft design and optimising the environment in which the aircraft operates. That is why our Smarter Skies concepts focus on not just what we fly but how we might fly in 2050 and beyond.’

Aircraft waste a lot of fuel by slowly climbing to their cruising height. Airbus wants to sit them on a moving platform that can be propelled down the runway to give them an extra boost during take-off. This will mean a much steeper climb, which will get planes airborne with less waste.

Once they’re in the air, the planes take a cue from nature. One reason birds fly in formation is to save energy. Flying in the slipstream of calmer air behind the bird in front of you takes less effort than flying solo and engineers say this applies equally to aircraft.

The idea is for planes to rendezvous in mid-air and follow the same flight path – when crossing the Atlantic, for example – and then break formation to continue to their individual destinations. In its simulation, planes stay up to one nautical mile apart and still receive some benefit from ‘flocking’. Journey times would be reduced by an average of 13 minutes, saving around 9million tonnes of fuel and 28million tonnes of CO2 a year.

Landing is equally important. Planes descend slowly and use up fuel with engine thrusts and air braking. Airbus proposes steeper, computer-assisted landing, allowing aircraft to glide rapidly down, saving time and fuel and reducing noise. Free gliding approaches also slow a plane down earlier, which means shorter runways, reducing the need for miles of new asphalt.

The plans are not just about saving fuel but also replacing it with cheaper and greener renewable biofuels made from plant and animal matter. Biofuels have been around for decades, but it is only recently that they’ve become advanced enough to make jet fuel.

However, there is a debate that growing crops to produce biofuels may produce more greenhouse gases than it saves. If scientists can crack that problem, Airbus believes it’s possible to have locally grown biofuels serving airlines in a sustainable way.

In the meantime, the cost of air travel is continuing to climb both in terms of fares and damage to the environment. Climate change campaigners would prefer we cut down on flying for all but the most essential journeys, but the lure of foreign travel is as great as ever. Even if the Airbus blueprint is the future of air travel, its solutions are still decades away.

Flight Log

Eco-climb: An assisted take-off mechanism would mean shorter runways and lighter aircraft. This steep take-off would be cheaper, quicker and quieter.

Express skyways: Planes flying like flocks of geese would encounter less drag and so use less fuel and thereby cut emissions. ‘Intelligent’ aircraft would also be able to calculate the quickest and most fuel-efficient route in advance.

Glided landings: More advanced air traffic management would allow planes to glide on to the runway instead of making a staged descent.

Cleaner fuel: Aircraft would be powered by biofuels derived from plant and animal matter.This and other forms of alternative energy would mean lower emissions.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9860045313835144}",neutral,0.9860045313835144,0

Airbus increasing industrial cooperation in South Africa; partnering on titanium manufacturing process - defenceWeb,"Thu, 13 Sep 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbmNld2ViLmNvLnphL2luZHVzdHJ5L2luZHVzdHJ5LWluZHVzdHJ5L2FpcmJ1cy1pbmNyZWFzaW5nLWluZHVzdHJpYWwtY29vcGVyYXRpb24taW4tc291dGgtYWZyaWNhLXBhcnRuZXJpbmctb24tdGl0YW5pdW0tbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy1wcm9jZXNzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and Aerosud have agree to partner on a research project to test the application of titanium powder-based Additive layer Manufacturing (ALM) for the fabrication of large and complex aerospace components. ALM promises to be faster and cheaper than conventional manufacturing processes.

The initiative is another example of Airbus’s industrial partnerships with local South African industry. The titanium ALM project is the latest in a series of Airbus Research and Technology partnerships established under a 2006 agreement with the Department of Science and Technology.

It will see Airbus, supported by EADS Innovation Works, cooperating with South African aerostructures manufacturer Aerosud and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research’s (CSIR’s) National Laser Centre (NLC). Together, they will test and evaluate this new approach as it is applied to producing larger-scale titanium parts at high speed by using the NLC’s expertise in high-powered lasers and laser-based manufacturing expertise.

If successful, the project could have significant cost and environmental efficiency ramifications for airlines, aircraft operators, the aerospace and other manufacturing industries in addition to boosting South Africa’s minerals beneficiation strategy, Airbus said.

“ALM involves forming an object from powder, which is arranged in layers and fused by high-speed lasers. It is a process completely devoid of bulk machining, cutting and welding thereby minimizing waste and optimizing the manufacturing process. It’s like printing in 3D,” explained the CSIR’s Hardus Greyling, project coordinator of project Aeroswift at the CSIR.

Aerosud and the CSIR NLC have been developing the innovative ALM approach under the Department of Science & Technology-funded Aeroswift project. Initial proof-of-concept studies were carried out a few months ago and based on the results a decision was made to construct a full scale prototype system to demonstrate the technology. This technology will allow the production of large geometrically complex items. “Typically focusing on parts which are prohibitively expensive or impossible to make using traditional methods,” said Aerosud Managing Director, Dr Paul Potgieter.

“SA is the second-largest supplier of (titanium) mineral ore…but adds little value to that before export,” Deputy Science and Technology Minister Derek Hanekom said at the launch of project Aeroswift in January this year. “The CSIR has developed a novel process whereby titanium metal powder can be produced from our abundant mineral resource. Currently the primary titanium process is being commercialised and a pilot plant will be built during the year.”

The heart of Aeroswift is the NLC’s new 5 kW IPG single-fibre diode laser. The CSIR NLC has already, in its proof of concept trials, achieved production speeds 8.3 times greater than currently available commercial selective laser melting machines. The proof of concept trials involved the production of small parts, no longer than 50 cm. With Aeroswift, the aim is to produce parts as big as 2 x 0.5 metres

“There is no doubt that ALM is changing the small-scale component manufacturing landscape and with Airbus joining the partnership, it will be possible to test and evaluate the manufacturing process on large components for passenger jetliners,” explained Dale King, Airbus Senior Manager International Research & Technology Projects.

“The above-mentioned projects have been supported through research and technology development funding grants of approximately R65 million over the last six years from the Department of Science and Technology” said Beeuwen Gerryts, Chief Director at the Department of Science & Technology. He said he was excited to see the ALM initiative at this stage of development and added that it was an example of the importance of global research and development.

The project is central to South Africa’s national titanium beneficiation strategy, which aims to transform the country from an exporter of raw materials to an exporter of semi-finished or finished goods, which can be sold at a premium compared with the material in its raw state. South Africa has spent R200 million since 2006 on the titanium beneficiation programme, including the ALM project.

Current manufacturing relies on traditional milling and machining where components are cut and carved out of a metal billet, a process that typically sees up to 95 percent of expensive raw material going to waste. In contrast, the ALM technique minimizes material wastage by building up a component from powder, with the optimal amount of material being consumed in the process. Any powder left over can be dusted off and used again. The potential cost savings in raw materials could potentially amount to millions of dollars on every jetliner built. In addition, the weight savings are likely to result in significant cost savings and reduced emissions through lower fuel consumption.

Aerosud expects to turn on the new titanium ALM machine in March 2013, and run it as a pilot plant. Full-scale production will start approximately two years after that. The company is collaborating with Airbus on guiding the manufacturing process for aircraft components – the titanium ALM process is a South African project involving South African funding and South African intellectual property. Components will mostly be used in engines, where heat-resistant titanium is required.

“We’re here in South Africa, we’re committed and we recognise the sills you have here,” said King, affirming Airbus’s commitment to build skills in the country.

Airbus launched its South African R&T programme in 2006 under an agreement with the Department of Science & Technology and the Department of Trade & Industry. Airbus’s South African R&T projects are coordinated through the DTI’s National Aerospace Centre. Airbus has forged partnerships with Stellenbosch University, WITS University, University of Cape Town and various units of the CSIR, working on a variety of projects.

Airbus has a long history of industrial cooperation with South African industry, and considers South Africa to be a strategic industrial partner for its range of commercial aircraft and the Airbus Military A400M airlifter.

Airbus works with three main suppliers in South Africa, Cape Town based Cobham Omnipless, Johannesburg based Denel Aerostructures and Aerosud in Centurion.

Aerosud has steadily taken on responsibility for manufacturing an increasing variety of wing and fuselage items for Airbus. They include avionics-bay racks, flap track cans and wing parts for the entire Airbus single-aisle aircraft family (A318, A319, A320 and A321) and the wing tips, galleys, rigid bulkhead and linings for the cockpit, nose fuselage and cargo hold for the A400M.

Aerosud manufactures A350 track can components for the A350 XWB through a contract awarded by Kansas based Spirit AeroSystems, one of Airbus’ major risk sharing partners on the A350 XWB programme. Aerosud is also contracted produce the CFRP Frame Clips for the centre section of the A350 XWB, which links the composite skins to the frames and stringers. The Frame Clips are the first composite airframe components of any Airbus commercial aircraft to be produced in South Africa.

Cobham provides satellite communication systems for the entire Airbus family of aircraft, including the A380 and the A350 XWB.

Denel-Saab Aerostructures hosts a dedicated A400M Design Engineering centre at its facility opposite O.R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg. It is home to over 50 engineers tasked with the design and integration of complex hybrid assemblies for the new military aircraft. Denel-Saab Aerostructures manufactures the A400M’s top-shells and the wing-fuselage fairing. This fairing is an aerodynamically critical section of the aircraft, measuring 15.5 m long x 7 m wide x 2 m deep, making it the largest single aircraft structural component ever produced in South Africa.

Other South African suppliers for Airbus aircraft include Saab Avitronics (A400M life-time monitoring system) and AAT Composites (buyer-furnished seat components and cabin stowages certified for use in all Airbus products).

Airbus was also instrumental in the establishment of Africa NDT, a Pretoria-based non-destructive testing centre serving South Africa’s aerospace community. Africa NDT is jointly owned by NDT Expert, a Toulouse based subsidiary of Airbus’ parent, EADS, France’s industrial standards agency, Bureau Veritas and Aerosud.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9980818033218384}",neutral,0.9980818033218384,0

"The best seats in Pearl Business Class, Etihad Airbus A330-200 - Executive Traveller","Tue, 18 Sep 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vdGhlLWJlc3Qtc2VhdHMtaW4tcGVhcmwtYnVzaW5lc3MtY2xhc3MtZXRpaGFkLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzMwLTIwMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Travelling in business class from Brisbane to Abu Dhabi via Singapore with Virgin Australia's partner Etihad? The latest in our ongoing series of Best Seats guides brings you seat recommendations that can net you a few extra inches of bed length on board.

Etihad has just under 20 of the A330-200 in its fleet, mainly used for medium-range flights to secondary European cities -- and on the Abu Dhabi-Singapore-Brisbane hop, which will go daily in February.

You'll find Etihad's impressive Pearl Business Class on board, with 22 seats fully flat seats -- all of which have direct aisle access -- in the popular staggered seating layout that means nobody has to clamber over anybody else to get to the aisle.

Note that this seating pattern means that middle pairs and window seats have a few inches more length in bed mode than their aisle compatriots.

The best seats on the plane

7A 7K: These window seats are furthest away from sources of noise and disturbance like the galley kitchens and lavatories. They're also the longer version of the seats if you're taller.

9A 9K 5A 5K: The other four window seats in the cabin are a good bet if you can't get the ones in row 5.

7E 7F: While the middle pairs are a little close to each other if you don't know the person you're travelling with really well, the extra length is a bonus, as with all middle seats.

The worst seats on the plane

5K: right next to the lavatory, this is one of the noisiest spots on the plane. Avoid it if you can.

10E 10F: many passengers dislike these seats because they're all on their lonesome at the back of the cabin, right in front of the space where economy passengers congregate to use the lavatories immediately behind.

"Thai's Airbus A380 routes: HK, Singapore, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Osaka, Paris, Sydney & London - Executive Traveller","Thu, 27 Sep 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vdGhhaS1zLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLXJvdXRlcy1oay1zaW5nYXBvcmUtZnJhbmtmdXJ0LXRva3lvLW9zYWthLXBhcmlzLXN5ZG5leS1sb25kb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Wondering when you can fly Thai Airways' new Airbus A380?

With six superjumbos on the shopping list there'll be just a handful of select destinations: Hong Kong, Singapore, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Paris, Osaka and Sydney.

According to Thai's final A380 schedule – released today at the airline's A380 delivery event in Airbus HQ at Toulose, France – the A380 will shuttle back and forth from Bangkok to Hong Kong and Singapore on daily runs from October 6 to December 14.

These short-term bedding-in flights are fairly standard practice for airlines while they train up their crew on all-new planes.

From December 15 the A380 will strut its stuff on the first long-haul route with daily flights between Bangkok and Frankfurt (TG920/921), with the Singapore and Hong Kong services going back to smaller aircraft.

As of January 16, 2013, Tokyo's Narita airport will be added to the daily list (TG676/677), with Paris-Charles de Gaulle following from February 16 (TG930/931).

Osaka is next on that list, starting on August 16 (TG622/623), while Sydney will follow on September 16 (TG475/476).

London is also on the cards, says Thai Airways, with its sixth and final A380 slated for a daily service between Heathrow and Bangkok from October.

Thai's A380 will carry 507 passengers in first, business and economy class.

Business class is the big winner here, with fully lie-flat seats and a staggered 1-2-1 layout so that every passenger has direct access to the aisle.

Airbus Military reconfirms A400M production output for 2013 - defenceWeb,"Mon, 03 Sep 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuY2V3ZWIuY28uemEvYWVyb3NwYWNlL2Flcm9zcGFjZS1hZXJvc3BhY2UvYWlyYnVzLW1pbGl0YXJ5LXJlY29uZmlybXMtYTQwMG0tcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1vdXRwdXQtZm9yLTIwMTMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Despite a small schedule change in initial delivery plans, Airbus Military has reconfirmed that it will deliver the first four A400M airlifters to customers in 2013 as planned, following the development of solutions to the recent engine issue, which prevented the A400M from participating in the Farnborough Air Show flying display.

Airbus Military recently experienced an engine issue on aircraft MSN6, the first production representative development aircraft. After receiving the Restricted Type Certificate (RTC) from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) last April, MSN6 started performing the 300 hour Function and Reliability (F&R) testing required for the award of the full Type Certificate (TC). Tests had to be suspended after 160 hours of F&R flying because of the repeated detection of metallic chips in the oil system of one of the engines.

Airbus Military has supported the engine manufacturer Europrop International (EPI) in its investigations of the root cause and fixes, the company said on Friday. EPI’s investigations have demonstrated that the failure does not impact the engines’ full capabilities and that the chip detection was provoked by a crack of a cover plate, a mechanical piece isolating elements within the Propeller Gear Box (PGB). As a responsibility of EPI, they have already made a new design available, which is currently in the validation process. Consequently, the MSN6 engines as well as all series production engines have been sent back to EPI for replacement of this cover plate.

Airbus Military said it is working with EPI on a plan to minimize the lead-time of the cover plate replacement in order to resume the F&R flying as soon as possible. F&R activity will be able to restart when MSN6 is fitted with the modified engines and upon agreement with EASA of a new F&R plan.

As a consequence, the civil Type Certification and military Initial Operating Capability (IOC) will now move into the first quarter of next year, followed by first delivery to the French Air Force (MSN7) in the second quarter of 2013.

“Despite this we maintain the overall delivery plan of four aircraft in 2013. There is a slight impact on the delivery of the second French aircraft (MSN8) while MSN9 (the first Turkish aircraft) and MSN10 (the third for France) will remain on schedule with delivery before the end of 2013. Other deliveries in 2014 and beyond continue as planned,” Airbus Military said.

EPI President Simon Henley said: “We are working very hard to reduce the lead-time on these replacements to allow Airbus Military to resume the flight test as soon as possible and continue the series production as planned”.

Flight testing outside the F&R programme is continuing, focusing primarily on military capabilities and systems, and the Grizzly development aircraft fleet has now completed more than 3 700 flight hours in nearly 1 250 flights.

Industrially, the first three customer aircraft are now in the final assembly process in Seville, Spain, and a further ten aircraft are in various stages of production with long-lead items launched up to MSN23 and advancing according to plan.

The A400M has been developed at a cost of more than 20 billion euros for Britain, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey. The aircraft has been flying since December 2009.

Despite the aircraft’s complexity and development problems, Airbus parent EADS says the A400M will be a reliable and effective aircraft once it enters service. Airbus hopes to sell around 500 more of the aircraft, from which it will pay back part of the extra money pumped in by purchasing nations.

Airbus Military has 174 A400M aircraft on order, including seven for Belgium, 50 for France, 53 for Germany, one for Luxembourg, 27 for Spain, ten for Turkey, 22 for the UK and four for Malaysia. The UK has options for three and Germany has options for seven.

Due to delays and cost increases, some nations have cut back their A400M orders or cancelled them outright, as South Africa did in November 2009 after citing massive cost inflation. At the end of November last year Airbus signed an agreement with Armscor that confirmed the cancellation of the eight aircraft ordered in 2005. As a result, Airbus Military refunded South Africa €321 million (R3.48 billion) in pre-payments and other related costs.

South African companies Denel Aerostructures (DAe) and Aerosud remain full industrial partners in the A400M programme, providing design, engineering and manufacturing of major components for the aircraft. In addition, Cobham South Africa in Cape Town supplies satellite communications antennae for Airbus Military and Airbus commercial aircraft.

DAe is responsible for one of the largest composite-metallic hybrid structures on the A400M, namely the Wing-to-Fuselage Fairing (WFF). The WFF protects the equipment under the centre wing portion against lightning strikes, hail damage and bird strikes. Each fairing is 15 m long, 7 m wide, and nearly 3 m high.

DAe also manufactures the aircraft’s Top Shells – positioned in front of and behind the wings where it is joined to the fuselage. They are made up of more than 1 100 parts, consisting of a large machined skin, engineered out of an aluminium alloy. Its brackets support the electric and electronic wiring, hot air and heat exchange piping as well as the aircraft’s life-rafts.

Both parts were designed from scratch by DAe and are manufactured at the company’s production facilities located next to O R Tambo International Airport.

Denel Aerostructures is currently ramping up its production to meet Airbus Military’s delivery schedules. Within the next four years DAe will manufacture 24 ship sets per year, moving off the production lines for final assembly in Seville, Spain.

For its part, Aerosud is responsible for a number of secondary structures on the A400M, including the nose fuselage linings, cargo hold linings, and cockpit linings, the cockpit rigid bulkhead and the nose fuselage galleys as well as the wingtips.

Denel Aerostructures is in the process of receiving a third work package from Airbus Military to build tail plane ribs and spars for the A400M.

The A400M was designed to give Europe autonomy in military transport, which is dominated by the Lockheed Martin C130 Hercules turboprop and the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III jet transport. But technical problems and mismanagement kicked the project four years behind schedule and €7.6 billion over budget. For a while, the A400M crisis cast a shadow over the future of EADS as the cost of abandoning the project would have been staggering in penalties alone.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8678447604179382}",neutral,0.8678447604179382,0
