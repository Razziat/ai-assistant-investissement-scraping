"Airbus begins ""stuffing"" A220 to speed assembly, cut costs - Leeham News and Analysis","Tue, 28 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8yOC9haXJidXMtYmVnaW5zLXN0dWZmaW5nLWEyMjAtdG8tc3BlZWQtYXNzZW1ibHktY3V0LWNvc3RzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Scott Hamilton

Sept. 28, 2021, © Leeham News: Airbus is streamlining some of its production of the A220 to reduce costs and the time to assemble the airplanes at its Montreal and Mobile plants.

Florent Massou, the SVP and Head of the A220 program, told LNA the company wants to shave 50% of the final assembly time for the A220. There will be an unrevealed cost reduction, which Massou declined to reveal. But he said it isn’t a one-for-one cost reduction.

Final assembly typically runs 5% to 8% of the total cost of the airplane, according to Boeing’s touch labor union, the IAM 751. Whether this equates to the A220, which began life as a Bombardier aircraft, is unknown.

Cutting costs

Bombardier was faced with start-up costs of what was then known as the C Series. An analysis early in the program by LNA concluded the early CS 100s cost about $33m. The larger CS 300 cost $2m-$3m more, according to the same analysis. The cost comes down as the learning curve goes up.

Airbus purchased control of the program in 2017. It has since increased its ownership from 50.1% to the current 75%. The Province of Quebec owns the remaining 25%. Airbus can buy out the 25% in 2024.

An early Airbus challenge is to bring the cost down, dramatically. At the current low-rate production of about 5/mo, Airbus loses about $400m a year on the program, according to a London financial analyst who follows Airbus. (Massou declined to confirm this figure.)

Massou decline to reveal how long it takes Airbus to assemble an A220. LNA estimates it takes about 14 days. A 50% reduction, to about seven days, is in line with Boeing’s time to assemble a 737, pre-COVID, pre-grounding of the MAX.

Reducing the assembly time and increasing the production rates are key elements to cost reduction. Airbus wants to increase the rate to 14/mo by 2025: 10 at Mirabel and four at Mobile. Mobile, a brand new plant, currently assembles the A220 at the rate of 1.5/mo, up from 1/mo at the beginning of the year. The rate will increase to 2/mo early next year, Airbus says.

Stuffing fuselages

Cutting costs from the supply chain has been a goal by Airbus since before the 2017 transaction closed. This effort continues. This new plan already has been implemented: Airbus began “stuffing” fuselages with systems above the floor level before fuselages hit the final assembly line in Mirabel and Mobile.

The old Bombardier/Mitsubishi CRJ production building, which Airbus purchased as part of the C Series deal, is being converted to a pre-FAL line that opens early next year. The pre-FAL area will be able to meet the 2025 production rate of 14/mo.

The FAL is to focus on final assembly, Massou told LNA, not stuffing systems, pipes, insulation and such that goes behind the sidewall panels. The center fuselage comes from a Chinese company, but it so far has not been able to stuff the section. Airbus had to do this work at Mirabel. Wings from Spirit Aerosystems in Belfast, Northern Ireland, are stuffed there with the lines and piping.

Fuselages from Mirabel destined for the Mobile FAL are trucked.

Future Airplane

The A220-100 and A220-300 (nee CS 100 and CS 300) are assembled at both plants. Bombardier designed a larger CS 500, a direct competitor to the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737-8. Now called the A220-500, the design has “flown” in computers and it ready to go any time Airbus is ready to launch the model. With 2,537 A320neos in backlog at Aug. 31, Airbus doesn’t have a pressing need to do so. (Parenthetically, Airbus has a backlog of 3,047 A321neos, or 54.5% of the backlog of the two models.) Launching the A220-500 most likely won’t happen unless or until the backlog of the A320 shrinks and few orders are coming in.

If Airbus were to create an “A320.5”—a slight stretch of 12 passengers plus a new wing and upgraded versions of the current engines, an A220-500 would slot in nicely below this larger model. Airbus’s single-aisle product line would then span 110-240 passengers, smothering Boeing’s 737 MAX.

MAX backlog

There are 4,078 MAXes in backlog, including about 225 MAX 7s. Adjusted for the accounting standard ASC 606, which identifies orders as questionable for financial reasons of the customers, the backlog is 3,325. Boeing doesn’t break out MAX sub-type orders. However, LNA estimates that about 15% of the backlog is for the MAX 9/10, or 611 to 500 before-and-after ASC 606. Because Airbus doesn’t identify the ASC 606-type of impact, we’ll ignore this accounting standard. Airbus has an estimated 83% market share of the MAX 9/10 vs A321 sector backlog. LNA believes Boeing has a slight edge in the 737-8 vs A320 sector. Boeing has roughly three times the Airbus share of the MAX 7 vs A319neo sector. But throw in the A220-300, the direct competitor to the MAX 7, plus the 70 A319neos, and Airbus has twice the backlog in the 125-149 seat sector.

Adding an A220-500 to complement the A320.5 would be devastating to Boeing’s single-aisle product line.

Airbus X-Plane Will Test Inflight Folding Wingtips - Aviation Week,"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9zcGVjaWFsLXRvcGljcy9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9haXJidXMteC1wbGFuZS13aWxsLXRlc3QtaW5mbGlnaHQtZm9sZGluZy13aW5ndGlwc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As manufacturers strive to reduce the fuel burn and emissions of their next generation of commercial airliners, longer wings are near the top of the list.

Extending the span would reduce cruise drag but could prevent aircraft using existing airport gates.

Enter the folding wingtip, already a feature of the in-development Boeing 777X. Airbus also is looking at folding wingtips, but a group within the manufacturer is planning to go a step further. If a folding wingtip is to be installed for ground use, why not use it in flight?

Increasing wing aspect ratio reduces lift-induced drag, which accounts for more than 30% of aircraft drag. Extending the span also increases wing weight but using the folding wingtip for load alleviation in gusts and maneuvers promises to minimize the weight penalty for higher aspect ratio.

A freely flapping hinge does not pass bending moment, so if the wingtip is free to flap in gusts the additional span does not increase the bending moment on the wing. Also, if the hinge is angled relative to the flow over the wing, it is statically stable because aerodynamic stiffness limits the flapping.

Airbus calls the technology the semi-aeroelastic hinge—semi because it can be locked and unlocked to freely flap in flight. The promise of the technology was shown in 2019-20 flights of a subscale unmanned model, the AlbatrossONE, developed by Airbus UK.

Hints that Airbus planned to demonstrate the technology by modifying a Cessna Citation business jet surfaced early in 2021. Now, The Air Current has revealed the demonstrator project is called X-Wing and involves fitting a Citation VII with a new composite wing and fly-by-wire controls for unmanned flights.

An Aviation Week source familiar with the project says it is aimed at testing a 30%-scale version of 52 m-span (171 ft.-span) wing with a moveable wingtip section for potential application to a single-aisle transport. The moveable tip section on the Citation VII will be 2 m long, compared to 2.4 m for the current A320 “sharklet” winglet.

The wingtip will be attached to the end of the high-aspect-ratio composite test wing via an electrically powered actuating hinge mechanism incorporating a drive gearbox and clutch. The system will operate in two main modes. In the first, the electric motor will drive the gearbox to position the wingtip to specific angles for various flight modes as well as takeoff and landing. The second mode, which involves declutching the drive mechanism, will enable the wingtip to move freely on its semi-aeroelastic hinge.

The hinge system will receive position commands from the flight control computer. Commands will be to move the tip in various degree increments up and down, or to disengage the clutch. Target is to begin flight tests with the flapping wing section in late 2023, the source said.

Wing Of Tomorrow

Tom Wilson, semi-aeroelastic hinge project leader, and James Kirk, AlbatrossONE chief engineer, at Airbus UK in Filton, England, gave a briefing on the technology and its progress at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics’ virtual SciTech 2021 conference in January.

A320-family aircraft have a wingspan of 36 m, for an aspect ratio of nine. Airbus’ Wing of Tomorrow research program is developing a 45-m-span, aspect-ratio-14 composite wing for an A320-class aircraft, enabled by ground-folding wingtips that allow the aircraft to still fit a standard 36-m Code C gate.

“With the semi-aeroelastic hinge we hope to add approximately another 7 m, for an aspect ratio of 18,” said Wilson. Going from 45 m to 52 m will reduce induced drag, which is inversely proportional to the square of aspect ratio, “but because of the huge load alleviation potential we hope to get this aerodynamic gain without having to incur the weight penalty.”

A flight starts with the wingtips folded at the gate. The tips are folded down while taxiing out and unlocked during the takeoff roll. “We do this for handling qualities so we can reduce the roll damping and roll the aircraft faster, because with the high mass when the wing is full of fuel it’s difficult to roll the aircraft with the increased span,” Kirk said.

Once the aircraft takes off, the wingtips are left free for first-segment climb. Then in second-segment climb the tips are locked and recovered to the plane of the wing. “The folding mechanism will find the wingtips, lock them and then pull them back down to a planar position. With the wingtips down in this planar configuration they are fully loaded, and we have a fully effective lifting span, so we get the maximum efficiency for cruise, minimizing induced drag,” he said.

“Then, when we don’t want these long thin wings generating a high bending moment during a gust or maneuver, we unlock the wingtips and allow them to be free to offload the wing,” Kirk said. “The wingtips have been unlocked and are completely free about the hinges, passing no bending moment,” he added.

“We have to detect the gust on the nose of the aircraft, and then there’s a race. We have to send the signal from the detection sensor to the hinge to release the wingtip before the gust arrives on the wing,” Wilson said. “It’s a question of a few hundred milliseconds. The release system has to be very quick.” After the gust or maneuver, the wingtips are locked and recovered to continue efficient flight.

Because it can be difficult to fit high-lift devices such as leading-edge slats to folding wingtips, during the landing flare the semi-aeroelastic hinge could be used to angle the tips up so there is a geometric reduction in the angle-of-attack of the tip, helping prevent wingtip stall. “So you can improve your low-speed performance,” he said.

“At the moment, the concept is that the wingtips are locked during the flare,” Wilson said. For safety, the semi-aeroelastic hinge system may be treated similarly to a thrust reverser, requiring a 10-9 probability of catastrophic failure, he said. After landing, the tips go into their ground folded position.

Flapping Wingtips

The AlbatrossONE project was named after the albatross because of a unusual feature of the long-soaring bird. A sheet of tendons allows an albatross to lock its shoulder and keep its wing outstretched for an extended time without using its muscles. When it needs to flap its wing, the albatross can unlock its shoulder.

AlbatrossONE was a 1/14th-scale (7%) radio-control model of an A321 with a 52-m-span wing, giving the electric-powered model about a 4-m span. The objective of the project was to demonstrate that freely flapping wingtips are an idea worth pursuing for load alleviation, to investigate the handling qualities and to show that a wingtip could be recovered after it was released.

“We wanted to convince Airbus and the aviation community that this could work, and the best way to do that was to build it and fly it,” said Kirk. “In 20 months, we went from a clean-sheet design to a flying aircraft on a very, very low budget. We achieved this with an army of intern, graduates and apprentices. Some would call it slave labor,” he joked.

To save time and money, the model was scaled physically and not dynamically, so some aeroelastic effects of flapping wingtips could not be explored. “We basically ensured the 1G spanwise lift distribution was scaled so we had a representative loading on the wingtip,” he said.

In February 2019, the model made two flights from Aston Down airfield in England, AlbatrossONE becoming the first Filton-manufactured aircraft to fly since the Concorde. The folding mechanism had yet to be manufactured, so the wingtips were fixed for the first flight and freely flapping for the second.

Bending moments measured on both flights clearly showed the load alleviation benefit of allowing the wingtips to freely flap, Kirk said. The second flight also showed the folding wingtips were statically and dynamically stable throughout the flight. The first flight showed the fixed wing suffered tip stall. On both flights, the aircraft exhibited Dutch roll instability, a yaw-roll coupling.

The model was improved for the second phase of flights, with upgraded instrumentation, flight controls and weight reductions to allow a bigger battery to increase flight endurance to 5 min. Tip stall was fixed by adding leading-edge droop to the wing and a yaw damper was added to solve the Dutch roll issue.

The folding mechanism and control system was installed, enabling inflight release and recovery of the wingtips as well as ground folding. One half of the aircraft was then mounted on the side of van and driven down the runway as quick and cheap way to verify the stall fix as well as check the lock, release and recovery operation of the semi-aeroelastic hinge.

Next came a tether test. Attached to a cable, the model was flown round and round in a circle inside a building. “The original idea of the tether test was yaw damper tuning, but it became much more,” Wilson said. The test also looked at handling qualities, wingtip folding angle as aircraft angle-of-attack and sideslip changed, as well as some failure cases with the hinges. “And in addition to that it was a good shakedown of the aircraft and test processes, and also the team ahead of flying,” he added.

“We even tested our safety parachute,” Wilson said. “We discovered that if you have a small airplane which is fully instrumented and you have a large building and a cable, then you can do a low-risk test and get a lot of useful information out of it.”

Phase 2 flight testing began in July 2020 at Shenington, another former military airbase in England. The goal of these flights was to demonstrate full gate-to-gate functionality of the semi-aeroelastic hinge technology. Bending-moment data from the flights showed a reduction with the wingtips unlocked. Roll-rate data showed “a free wingtip is equivalent to having no wingtip in terms of roll damping,” Kirk said.

AlbatrossONE also demonstrated what happens if there is a failure in flight and the wingtips cannot be locked and the aircraft has to land with them freely flapping. Modeling suggested aerodynamic stiffness and damping is sufficient to retard the motion of the wingtips so they do not hit the ground. A bounce landing of the AlbatrossONE confirmed this, the tips staying at least 10 deg. above the plane of the wing. “This is telling us that landing with fee wingtips is very much a feasible proposition,” said Wilson.

There was a question about how the flapping wingtips would behave in sideslip. Another tether test showed that, at high angle of attack, as the sideslip angle approaches the hinge flare angle, the tip collapses against the wing. “When we design a future aircraft with this technology, we will have to make sure we have stoppers so that, if the aircraft is in extremely high slideslip at low speed, collapsing of the wingtip can’t happen,” he said."

Release Date September 16, 2021 X-Wing comes to light as major new Airbus demonstrator program Purchase a PDF of this article

In the early weeks of the pandemic’s ravaging of global commercial aviation, Airbus pulled the plug on a full-scale demonstrator program called E-Fan X, a bid to convert one of four engines on an aging regional jet to hybrid-electric propulsion. After its cancellation in April 2020, much of the technical leadership of that project moved to shepherd a new type of demonstrator.

The project is called X-Wing. It’s a name that belies the morphing shape of its wings and a nod to an iconic vehicle from science fiction, but well beyond the internal moniker are far reaching implications for Airbus’s future airliners and the unceasing competition with Boeing.

The company is expected to share additional details about its upcoming demonstrator aircraft at an event in Toulouse next week, focusing on its sustainability efforts. The Air Current has focused recent months extensively reporting on Airbus’s, until now, secret research effort to completely re-wing a Cessna business jet and rapidly accelerate a suite of new advanced flight control technologies — including a foldable wingtip designed to flap freely in turbulence and maneuvers.

Airbus is adamant that the demonstrator is not for any one specific application. Those involved in the program tell The Air Current that the building blocks of X-Wing are intended to serve as the basis for making its future technology choices in 2025 — leading to either a major incremental update to an existing program or a completely new clean-sheet design.

Major leaps in propulsion technology like next generation engine architectures, hydrogen, hybrid or electric propulsion offer a tantalizing revolution in carbon reduction, potentially ready for service by 2035. Yet, X-Wing underscores the challenge for modern commercial aircraft manufacturers about where and how to focus research to find future technological breakthroughs today.

Absent an all-new propulsion technology, the result of 70 years of commercial jet travel is that the next frontier is the sum total of incremental steps that all add up to the next big leap. Finding that next big jump in efficiency has become ever-more complex and expensive. The low hanging fruit has been picked clean.

“We will not launch a new product if we do not have a real breakthrough in terms of fuel consumption,” a senior Airbus official close to the demonstrator program tells TAC. “What we try here is to bring all the bits and pieces together to see how do we make it on a holistic view, something coherent. This is part of the demonstration to understand and define the best possible product.”"

Airbus Jumps Into Electric Air Taxi Race - Skift,"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZXdlZWtseS5za2lmdC5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS9haXJidXMtanVtcHMtaW50by1lbGVjdHJpYy1haXItdGF4aS1yYWNlL9IBV2h0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZXdlZWtseS5za2lmdC5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS9haXJidXMtanVtcHMtaW50by1lbGVjdHJpYy1haXItdGF4aS1yYWNlLz9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The electric aircraft market has gone from zero to 60 in just a matter of months, now that one of the world’s largest airframers has entered the race. Airbus said its Helicopters division is developing an electric take off and landing (eVTOL) air taxi that could take its first flight in 2023.

This is in stark contrast to Airbus archrival Boeing, which just last week committed only to consider alternative propulsion technologies in the near- to medium-term.

Meanwhile, Brazil’s Gol is committing to order up to 250 Vertical Aerospace eVTOLs through lessor Avolon and in partnership with Grupo Comparte to create an urban air taxi platform for country’s most congested cities. Gol’s proposed equity partner American Airlines also has a commitment for Vertical Aerospace’s VA-X4 aircraft.

Airbus unveiled the new concept aircraft, called the CityAirbus, today in Toulouse during the airframer’s first sustainability summit. The CityAirbus is a fixed-wing aircraft, equipped with a V-tail and eight electric propellers. The aircraft is capable of carrying four passengers up to 80 km (50 miles) at an airspeed of 120 kilometers per hour. The airframer stressed the CityAirbus’ green credentials extend to noise — a crucial consideration at European airports — and said it only registers 70 decibels at landing. By comparison, an A320 exceeds 100 decibels at landing, according to FAA data.

Airbus has conducted about 1,000 km of test flights with initial prototypes, and said a final prototype for the CityAirbus will be ready by 2023, with regulatory certification expected by 2025.

Although several companies, like Archer, Wisk, Vertical, and others, have made headlines with splashy orders for eVTOLs, none has the heft of Airbus, which along with Boeing effectively splits the commercial aircraft market. Airbus’ entry into the eVTOL race lends the sector credibility and arguably brings eVTOLs closer to reality. And a further point cannot be discounted: Unlike the other companies in the sector, Airbus has long and close relationships with the world’s aircraft regulators, which gives further credibility to its aggressive projected timeline for certification of the CityAirbus.

The problem of how to solve the “last mile,” or the segment of a trip from a major hub to a smaller city, has long bedeviled airlines. Connecting hub airports with smaller markets can be done more profitably — and more sustainably — with a small eVTOL, rather than a regional jet and an eVTOL arguably would be more sustainable than a car carrying a single passenger, even across a major metropolitan market, for example from Los Angeles International Airport to downtown Los Angeles.

“We are on a quest to co-create an entirely new market that sustainably integrates urban air mobility into the cities while addressing environmental and social concerns,” said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters. “Airbus is convinced that the real challenges are as much about urban integration, public acceptance, and automated air traffic management, as about vehicle technology and business models.”

And it is this last mile and concerns about urban mobility that informs Gol’s deal. Vertical specifically called out congestion in metropolitan São Paulo as an impetus for its deal for 250 VA-X4s. “Our eVTOLs will transform how we travel around high population density cities that are clogged with traffic by taking to the skies with zero emissions aircraft,” Vertical Commercial CEO Stephen Fitzpatrick said.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Avolon said that more than half of its 500-aircraft orderbook for VA-X4s has been spoken for. Grupo Comporte will provide the capital for the investment, Gol said.

Vertical’s VA-X4 tiltrotor features four electrically driven propellers and is capable of carrying four passengers more than 100 miles at a cruising speed in excess of 200 miles per hour. Gol expects Brazil’s regulators to approve the aircraft by 2024 with a forecast entry-into-service in Gol’s network by mid-2025.

Airlines around the world are scrambling into the electric aircraft race. United Airlines, American, Azul, and Virgin Atlantic are among the carriers that have made multi-billion dollar bets on the emerging technology."
Airbus reveals the next generation of CityAirbus - Airbus,"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0wOS1haXJidXMtcmV2ZWFscy10aGUtbmV4dC1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLW9mLWNpdHlhaXJidXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 21 September 2021 – Airbus has announced plans for a new CityAirbus at the Company’s first #AirbusSummit on “Pioneering Sustainable Aerospace” as the emerging Urban Air Mobility (UAM) market begins to firm up. Ushering in the next generation of CityAirbus, the fully electric vehicle is equipped with fixed wings, a V-shaped tail, and eight electrically powered propellers as part of its uniquely designed distributed propulsion system. It is designed to carry up to four passengers in a zero emissions flight in multiple applications.

“We are on a quest to co-create an entirely new market that sustainably integrates urban air mobility into the cities while addressing environmental and social concerns. Airbus is convinced that the real challenges are as much about urban integration, public acceptance, and automated air traffic management, as about vehicle technology and business models. We build on all of the capabilities to deliver a safe, sustainable, and fully integrated service to society,” said Bruno Even, Airbus Helicopters CEO.

CityAirbus is being developed to fly with a 80 km range and to reach a cruise speed of 120 km/h, making it perfectly suited for operations in major cities for a variety of missions.

Sound levels are a key factor for an urban mission; Airbus' extensive expertise in noise-friendly designs is driving CityAirbus' sound levels below 65 dB(A) during fly-over and below 70 dB(A) during landing. It is optimized for hover and cruise efficiency, while not requiring moving surfaces or tilting parts during transition. The CityAirbus NextGen meets the highest certification standards (EASA SC-VTOL Enhanced Category). Designed with simplicity in mind, CityAirbus NextGen will offer best-in-class economic performance in operations and support.

Airbus is benefitting from years of dedicated research, innovation, two electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) demonstrators, and development on sound technology across its portfolio of products, as well as decades of experience in certifying aircraft. The Vahana and CityAirbus demonstrators have jointly conducted 242 flight and ground tests and have flown around 1,000 km in total. Furthermore, Airbus has used extensive subscale flight testing and wind tunnel campaigns and has leveraged its computing and modelling power. CityAirbus NextGen is in a detailed design phase right now and the prototype’s first flight is planned for 2023.

“We have learned a lot from the test campaigns with our two demonstrators, CityAirbus and Vahana”, said Even. “The CityAirbus NextGen combines the best from both worlds with the new architecture striking the right balance between hover and forward flight. The prototype is paving the way for certification expected around 2025.”

Beyond the vehicle, Airbus is working with partners, cities, and city inhabitants in order to create the ecosystem that is essential to enabling this new operating environment to emerge in a true service to society.

This scaled demonstrator will integrate and fly breakthrough wing technologies on a Cessna Citation VII business jet platform in representative flight conditions. The applications of the extra-performing wing would be compatible with any propulsion solution and aircraft configuration and would reduce CO₂ emissions, contributing greatly to Airbus’ decarbonisation roadmap.

“Airbus’ extra-performing wing demonstrator is another example of Airbus’ novel technology-oriented solutions to decarbonise the aviation sector,” says Sabine Klauke, Airbus Chief Technical Officer. “Airbus is continuously investigating parallel and complementary solutions such as infrastructure, flight operations and aircraft structure. With this demonstrator, we will make significant strides in active control technology through research and applied testing of various technologies inspired by biomimicry. ”

Similar to how an eagle soars, adapting the shape, span and surface of its wings and feathers, this demonstrator allows for increased flight efficiency. Various technology bricks will be investigated to enable the active control of the wing, including: gust sensors, pop-up spoilers or plates that are rapidly deflected perpendicular to airflow, multifunctional trailing edges that dynamically change wing surface in flight and a semi-aeroelastic hinge.

The demonstrator is hosted within Airbus UpNext, a wholly-owned Airbus subsidiary created to give future technologies a development fast-track by building demonstrators at speed and scale, in order to evaluate, mature and validate potential new products and services that encompass radical technological breakthroughs."

The project opens the way to a future hybridised propulsion system for light helicopters while delivering concrete flight safety improvements in the short term. The campaign’s main target is to enhance flight safety of single engine operations by providing emergency electrical power in case of a turbine failure.

To conduct these tests the Flightlab was equipped with a 100 Kw electric motor connected to the main gearbox, which can provide electrical power for 30 seconds in the event of engine failure. By giving the pilot extra time to react and maintain rotor speed, the engine back-up system contributes to a safer and smoother autorotation maneuver to the ground. The current flight tests include the simulation of engine failure in different flight conditions, including takeoff and landing procedures and corresponding limitations.

While evaluating the safety margins and performance benefits, the flight campaign also aims to demonstrate a performance increase, thanks to the prompt electric power input. The potential benefit in terms of Maximum Take-Off Weight is to compensate for the mass of the EBS system itself and to provide helicopter operators with additional payload.

“The engine back-up system is a good example of the incremental approach in our innovation strategy”, declared Tomasz Krysinski, Head of Research and Innovation at Airbus Helicopters. “The current EBS flights are a very important first step towards a future hybrid propulsion system and we already foresee a second phase of the project with more energy and power on board. We are looking at developing a fully parallel hybrid propulsion system mixing thermal and electrical energy together with the aim of optimising fuel consumption and enabling hybrid single engine flights over urban areas”.

Because the EBS flight campaign also looks at ways of easing the possible introduction of this techno-brick onto future production aircraft, the various components of the system have been designed with serial production in mind.

Micro-hybridisation: the next frontier to electrify flight? - Airbus,"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA5LW1pY3JvLWh5YnJpZGlzYXRpb24tdGhlLW5leHQtZnJvbnRpZXItdG8tZWxlY3RyaWZ5LWZsaWdodNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Decarbonising flight will require a range of solutions, including new fuel types and innovative technologies. Some will bring radical changes, while others offer more incremental gains. Karim Mokaddem, Airbus Head of Electrification, describes the different ways hybrid-electric power can benefit fixed-wing aircraft and helicopter solutions.

The electrification of flight has accelerated rapidly in recent years, from the development of electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles (eVTOLs) for urban air travel to smaller fixed-wing aircraft that carry up to nine passengers. However, the technology’s leap to commercial aircraft has been beset by slower-than-expected progress.

As a veteran of the automotive industry, Karim Mokaddem has seen first-hand the rapid progress made in battery-electric power in recent years. The aviation industry may face different challenges, but he believes the time is right for hybrid-electric innovation to make its mark on commercial aircraft operations and beyond.

5 questions with Karim Mokaddem, Airbus Head of Electrification

Q. Advances in battery technology have enabled the rapid proliferation of electric vehicles in recent years. Why hasn’t the same happened for electric aircraft?

Today, lithium-ion batteries simply don’t offer the same energy density as other forms of propulsion. In other words, the poor battery-specific energy compared to kerosene is a real showstopper. To give an electric aircraft more power, we need more batteries, which means more weight. In aviation, added weight is a significant obstacle. For cars, this is less of an issue: they’re smaller, lighter and don’t fly, so they need much less power. And ultimately, cars recover energy when braking. As yet, we haven’t been able to achieve the same balance between weight, energy and power for a commercial aircraft like an A320.

That being said, batteries have proven to be highly efficient for smaller electric aircraft, particularly the next generation of urban air mobility vehicles, as demonstrated by Vahana and CityAirbus.



Q. So, does electrification still have a place in commercial aircraft? If yes, how?

Absolutely! Until we solve the energy-density challenge for propulsion, batteries can play more of a supporting role to reduce an aircraft’s CO₂ footprint. We call this micro-hybridisation. So instead of relying on thermal engines to completely power the aircraft, we could use small batteries to provide electrical power for some on-board systems, as well as to help relieve the engine in certain operations.

Until we solve the energy-density challenge for propulsion, batteries can play more of a supporting role to reduce an aircraft’s CO2 footprint. We call this micro-hybridisation.

- Karim Mokaddem, Airbus Head of Electrification

Q. In which applications could micro-hybridisation have the most impact?

In the near term, it’s most suited to powering non-propulsive functions, such as air conditioning and cabin pressurisation, communications, flight controls and landing gear.

We could also use micro-hybridisation for certain engine functions on the ground and even in the air. Right now, commercial aircraft rely on an auxiliary power unit – a small gas turbine – to deliver power on the ground and to help start the main engines. Batteries could relieve this in a more sustainable, fuel-efficient way.

And while current battery technology doesn’t have the right energy or power-to-weight ratio for intensive operations like take-off and cruise, we could use electric power to assist the thermal engines during taxi and descent.

Q. What would be the main advantages of electrifying an aircraft’s functions?

Any process that draws energy from a battery instead of a thermal engine will reduce emissions by eliminating the need to burn fossil fuels. We estimate that micro-hybridisation could reduce an aircraft’s environmental footprint by between 1% and 6%. For helicopters, it could be as much as 10%. Electrical systems are also typically easier to maintain than mechanical ones, which is another advantage. Lastly, micro-hybridisation could be an enabler for autonomous flight systems and connectivity technology, which will become increasingly important in the future.



Q. Does micro-hybridisation have applications beyond commercial aircraft?

Yes, it could be hugely beneficial for helicopters. Because they’re smaller and lighter than fixed-wing aircraft, there’s more immediate potential for battery-electric power to make a greater impact. Operating one engine on a twin-engine helicopter on electricity, for example, could reduce fuel consumption by between 15% and 25%. Military aircraft, too, could potentially implement micro-hybridisation techniques.

Ultimately, at Airbus, we aim to apply micro-hybridisation in a modular way across all our relevant products. Battery technology is evolving quickly, so it’s vital to get the architecture right today. In doing so, we can easily adapt as battery technology matures."
On the road to decarbonising industrial activities - Airbus,"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA5LW9uLXRoZS1yb2FkLXRvLWRlY2FyYm9uaXNpbmctaW5kdXN0cmlhbC1hY3Rpdml0aWVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In the framework of its sustainability ambitions for production activities, Airbus is introducing trucks powered by biogas to transport single-aisle nose kits from Méaulte to Saint-Nazaire, saving up to 80% of CO² compared to diesel. Airbus aims to expand the use of biogas trucks to transport other aircraft sections across Europe over the next two years.

By progressively reducing traditional fuels in industrial transport and replacing them with other types of propulsion systems or means, Airbus is making a major contribution to its global sustainability ambitions for 2025.

The use of biogas trucks is a part of the partnership agreement with the transporter Groupe Blondel. So far, they will be used in daily operations between Méaulte and Saint-Nazaire, meaning up to four convoys a day, carrying up to 12 single-aisle nose kit sections. In one year, on this route only, Airbus will save some 400 tons of CO².

Biogas is a renewable version of traditional natural gas, which has already been used by Airbus for some road transportation in Germany since 2020. Biogas is obtained from organic biomass in Europe. Compared to natural gas, biogas is made by methanising organic biomass waste, thus recycling materials. Across its entire lifecycle, biogas saves up to 80% of CO² emissions compared to diesel. In addition, trucks powered by biogas feature a 5 dB noise reduction when compared to those powered by diesel.

All single-aisle nose kits are now transported by biogas trucks, and this will continue to be the case as Airbus increases production rates.

Airbus and Groupe Blondel successfully found an agreement to maintain operating costs at their current level. This underlines the commitment of suppliers to support Airbus with its sustainability ambitions. Procurement policy now includes the consideration of environmental efforts in the bidders' offers, which will foster the deployment of biogas and other sustainable energies across industrial transportation activities in the years to come.

Reducing environmental impact by road, sea and air

In line with its sustainability ambitions, Airbus is an active contributor to the development of tomorrow’s greener aviation. The company is strongly committed to supporting the development and use of alternative fuels to reduce the impact of its industrial activities on the environment. The research and use of new technologies or alternative fuels are of particular importance when considering the expected increase of aircraft production in the years to come.

Airbus is progressively introducing alternative energy solutions to its different transportation means: air, road and maritime. Beyond the biogas trucks, Airbus has also been using sustainable aviation fuel in its fleet of Belugas since the end of 2019. And by the end of 2021, Airbus will also install a new propulsion sailing system, based on wind energy, in one of the vessels of the Airbus fleet that transports aerostructures from the Saint-Nazaire plant to its final assembly line (FAL) in Mobile, USA."

Mexico, 24 September 2021– Airbus has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Mexican Space Agency (AEM) and the Mexican start-up Dereum Labs to collaborate on the technologies needed for lunar resources extraction. This will lead to the creation of a new Mexican In-Situ Resources Utilisation (ISRU) Programme for lunar extraction and help develop the necessary industrial ecosystem for this technology in-country.



A ground demonstration concept is planned as part of this new programme. It will develop an end-to-end process from regolith identification and capture to extraction of resources. Specialist Mexican universities will also be invited to contribute to the project. This strategic demonstration will develop in-situ resource utilisation (ISRU) and Mexican capabilities, paving the way for future space exploration developments in Mexico and international cooperation with the private sector.

Innovative technologies from Mexico will contribute to a sustainable presence of humankind on the Moon. Under the helm of AEM, technologies from Dereum Labs will be key to ISRU systems for using local Moon resources like regolith, to extract oxygen and metal, or to mine water. These will be crucial to sustain life on the Moon and provide the resources needed to explore further. If such technologies are demonstrated, resources such as oxygen, water and fuel will not need to be sent from Earth. The journey towards a sustainable cis-lunar economy has started with Mexican technology aboard!

“This agreement represents the first step in a fruitful collaboration with Mexico in space activities,” said Victor de la Vela, Head of Airbus in Latin America & the Caribbean. ”Being able to extract and process lunar resources is essential to sustain long term living on the Moon. This collaboration gathers the right partners with the latest technologies and capabilities for a clearer horizon in lunar exploration.”

“At Dereum Labs we envision and work for an interplanetary economy; in a few years, the industries that today are not related to space will be doing business on the Moon, Mars and beyond,” said Carlos Mariscal, CEO of Dereum Labs. “With this agreement, the Mexican Space Agency, Airbus Defence and Space and Dereum Labs are taking together a huge step towards that future; today Mexico is contributing to long-term human presence in space. We are absolutely thrilled!”

""A great objective of the Mexican Space Agency has been to promote talent and entrepreneurship among our new generations, as well as the space industry in the country, so we are very pleased with this alliance,"" said the Director General of the AEM, Dr. Salvador Landeros Ayala.

Dereum Labs is developing innovative swarms of low-cost, modular rovers to demonstrate the mobility and communicability of robotic vehicles on the Moon for data gathering and mapping of lunar resources. Airbus is focusing on the key bricks for a lunar ecosystem: it is developing the technology to get vehicles and cargo to the surface of the Moon and then to explore and extract resources. It is also developing the ROXY system to extract oxygen and metals from lunar regolith since they are key elements of a sustainable lunar presence. Airbus Defence and Space and Dereum Labs share the same vision that leading terrestrial companies in key sectors like energy, infrastructure and mining should also be part of Moon exploration programmes.

Seeking the most energy efficient flight - Episode 1 : ALBATROSS - Airbus,"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA5LXNlZWtpbmctdGhlLW1vc3QtZW5lcmd5LWVmZmljaWVudC1mbGlnaHQtZXBpc29kZS0xLWFsYmF0cm9zc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With the launch of ALBATROSS, a 2 year SESAR project aiming to implement the most efficient flight, Airbus is taking a further step to meet its commitment to pioneer a sustainable future.

“Coordinated by Airbus in the Single European Sky ATM Research program (SESAR), ALBATROSS* is an initiative of major European aviation stakeholders to demonstrate how the technical and operational innovations we delivered in the past years can be combined and used all together to further reduce the environmental footprint of aviation on the short term” explain Mattia Nurisso, Project Leader, and Thierry Harquin, Air Traffic Management (ATM) Cooperation Manager for Airbus.

*: Please note that ALBATROSS is a separate initiative from the Airbus “AlbatrossOne” wing project.

20210357_infographic_16-9<br /> The most efficient flight

A series of gate-to-gate live trials across Europe…

To achieve this goal, the project will demonstrate in real conditions the feasibility of implementing more energy efficient flights through a series of gate-to-gate live trials across Europe. Starting from September 2021, with the launch of the first demonstration flight, these live demonstration flights will showcase through around 1,000 demonstration flights mature operational solutions with potential fuel and CO2 emissions savings selected from operational solutions each partner involved is working on (Airlines, Air Navigation Service Providers, Airport operators, Military, Network manager, Controllers, Pilots, Airframers and Suppliers).

In this ambitious project, Airbus is particularly in charge of the work packages “SAF” (Sustainable Aviation Fuels) and “Performance and Benefits Assessment”. To ensure objective measurability and representativeness of the results, ALBATROSS can count on Airbus knowledge & support in systematic data collection, Big Data Analytics, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

… By combining several solutions

“All the combined solutions will allow us to extend the benefits expected while covering all the flight phases, including operations on ground and during the flight, and addressing both operational and technological aspects of aviation and Air Traffic Management (ATM)” comment Mattia and Thierry.

Many solutions will be put into practice during the flight demonstrations from new precision approach procedures, to continuous climb and descent, or “sustainable aviation fuels” (SAF) usage. Several novel data analytics-based tools will be also introduced to assist pilots to identify tactical in-flight trajectory optimization opportunities to improve fuel efficiency. Possibilities to mitigate certain ATM constraints through airspace design by collaborative procedures and a certain degree of flexibility in the constraints will be tested as well. Moreover, a sustainable hybrid towing vehicle (""TaxiBot"") allowing taxi assistance without engines running will be used in order to reduce emissions on ground.

All the Airbus teams are already prepared to pioneer a sustainable future. Stay tuned!"

"307th Bomb Wing, Airbus collaborate on training - Minuteman","Mon, 13 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRvYmJpbnMuYWZyYy5hZi5taWwvTmV3cy9BcnRpY2xlLURpc3BsYXkvQXJ0aWNsZS8yNzcyNjc3LzMwN3RoLWJvbWItd2luZy1haXJidXMtY29sbGFib3JhdGUtb24tdHJhaW5pbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Members of the 307th Bomb Wing traveled to exchange training ideas with Airbus instructors at their facility in Grand Prairie, Texas, Sept. 8, 2021.

Airbus is an international helicopter company that provides training on its products to maintenance teams and aircrew. The 307th Bomb Wing, as part of its mission, is responsible for all initial and requalification training for all potential B-52 Stratofortress aircrew in the Air Force.

The collaboration was the brainchild of Master Sgt. Ed Wytaske, 307th Operations Support Squadron first sergeant. When he isn’t working as a traditional reservist, Wytaske works full time for Airbus as an avionics technical instructor.

“I saw it as an excellent opportunity to exchange ideas on training techniques between the two schoolhouses,” he said.

During the idea exchange, B-52 instructors and wing leadership from the 307th OSS, the 307th Operations Group, and the 93rd bomb squadron were able to ask Airbus aviation, pilot, and maintenance instructors about their best practices. They also saw demonstrations with software, tools, and simulators used at the company’s training site.

Col. David Anderson, 307th OG commander, said the idea exchange offered the B-52 instructors a unique perspective.

“Our instructors were able to share best practices and virtual reality training ideas with leaders in the aviation industry,” he said. “That insight can help give us some idea of where we are in our training and ways to move forward in the future.”

Both Anderson and Wytaske affirmed that this first collaboration between the two entities was productive and spoke of the possibility for future idea exchanges."
Airbus and partners target more energy efficient flights - Airbus,"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0wOS1haXJidXMtYW5kLXBhcnRuZXJzLXRhcmdldC1tb3JlLWVuZXJneS1lZmZpY2llbnQtZmxpZ2h0c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 21 September 2021 – Airbus, Air France and DSNA, the French Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP), have begun working towards the development of “most energy efficient flights”, following their inaugural demonstration flight from Paris to Toulouse Blagnac on the day of the Airbus Summit event. The aircraft flew an optimised trajectory, marking the first of a series of trials planned during 2021 and 2022 within the framework of the Single European Sky ATM Research Joint Undertaking (SESAR JU) “ALBATROSS” project.

Launched in February 2021, ALBATROSS is a large-scale initiative of major European aviation stakeholder groups led by Airbus. It aims to demonstrate, through a series of gate-to-gate live demonstration flights across Europe, the feasibility of implementing most energy efficient flights in the short term, by combining several R&D technical and operational innovations.

“ALBATROSS” follows an holistic approach by covering all flight phases, directly involving all relevant stakeholder groups (such as airlines, ANSPs, network managers, airports and industry) and addressing both operational and technological aspects of aviation and Air Traffic Management (ATM). Many solutions will be put into practice during the flight demonstrations, from new precision approach procedures to continuous climb and descent, a more dynamic management of necessary airspace constraints, sustainable taxiing and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) usage.

Thanks to the transmission of four-dimensional trajectory data, ATM will be able to optimise and better predict an aircraft’s trajectory, thereby enabling it to immediately and concretely reduce a flight's environmental footprint.

Starting from September 2021, these live trials will involve around 1,000 demonstration flights, showcasing mature operational solutions with potential fuel and CO2 emission savings. First results are expected to be available in 2022.

The ALBATROSS partners are Airbus, Air France, Austro Control, DLR, DSNA, Eurocontrol, LFV, Lufthansa, Novair, Schiphol, Smart Airport Systems, SWEDAVIA, SWISS, Thales AVS France and WIZZ AIR UK.

The funding of the project is provided by the EU under the Grant Agreement No 101017678."

Pontifications: How Airbus maneuvered Boeing into launching a re-engined 737 - Leeham News and Analysis,"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8xMy9wb250aWZpY2F0aW9ucy1ob3ctYWlyYnVzLW1hbmV1dmVyZWQtYm9laW5nLWludG8tbGF1bmNoaW5nLWEtcmUtZW5naW5lZC03Mzcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sept. 13, 2021, © Leeham News: Tomorrow night the US PBS network broadcasts an hour-long special examining the Boeing 737 MAX crisis.

Here is a preview. Afterward, the show will stream on PBS’s Frontline website.

I sat for a long interview for the investigation, which was a combination of reporting by Frontline and the New York Times. I haven’t previewed the show, so I don’t know how much of my interview—if any—survived the editing. But one area of the focus of the interview was how Boeing came to develop the MAX.

Following the crashes of Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines five-month-old MAXes, one of the allegations that emerged was that Boeing rushed the development of the airplane.

It’s true that Boeing decided within two days to launch the MAX program. It’s not true that development was “rushed,” in the most common use of the word. Boeing developed what became known as the MAX in parallel with an entirely new airplane concept that would have replaced the 737 Next Generation airplane. It’s what Boeing does: study two or more concepts as engineers and the executives decide what the next airplane will be.

The basic design was on the shelf, ready to go when Airbus forced Boeing’s hand on the cusp of a huge order from American Airlines for the A320ceo/neo family. When Boeing learned of this, the decision was rushed, within two days, to launch the re-engined 737 rather than a new airplane design.

In my new book, published Sept. 1, Air Wars, The Global Combat Between Airbus and Boeing, I outline just how the MAX came to be and how Airbus maneuvered Boeing into launching the program. The book is available globally on Amazon here.

Here is an excerpt from Chapter 1, one of three chapters about the neo-MAX development.

The Multi-Billion Dollar Gamble

By 2010, Airbus officials had some hard decisions to make. And some in the executive ranks were “terrified” to make it.

The A320 single-aisle family was selling well, with more than 7,000 program orders. The heart and soul of the Airbus, the family consisted of the 125-passenger A319, the 160-passenger A320, and the 190-passenger A321. The A319, once a strong selling airplane, held its own compared with Boeing’s 737-700. But sales of both aircraft had fallen off in favor of the larger A320 and Boeing’s 737-800. The -800 carried 12 more passengers than the A320, and its larger wing gave it more range. Boeing held a sales advantage over these two airplanes.

Airbus’s A321 had a clear market preference over Boeing’s 737-900ER. The A321 carried more passengers. The -900ER (for Extended Range) could fly farther. But airlines, especially those catering to leisure markets, preferred capacity to range. The A321 outsold the -900ER by about 3:1.

Airlines in 2010 were still recovering from the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. Losses were enormous, and some airlines went out of business. Others sought ways to cut costs, and one of the highest costs was fuel. Boeing was flirting with offering a new airplane to replace the 737. It also studied re-engining the 737. Airbus favored a lower-cost solution: re-engining the A320 with the GTF and an engine offered by P&W rival CFM International, called the LEAP.

However, if Airbus went this route, investing up to $2 billion in the process (with about half picked up by the engine manufacturers), would Boeing offer the new airplane? If so, Airbus would be forced to follow. Having committed to the re-engined A320, all this money would be down the drain. Airbus would have to develop a new airplane, costing at least $10 billion.

Skepticism over re-engining the A320

John Leahy, the chief operating officer-customers for Airbus, initially scoffed at re-engining the A320, at least publicly, but he had come around. Supported by Barry Eccleston, the president of Airbus North America, strategist Christian Scherer, his top lieutenant Kiran Rao and others on the Toulouse staff, Leahy now advocated the re-engining route. The family would have more range and substantially lower fuel consumption than the A320 or 737NG. New engines also meant lower fuel emissions. Activists in Europe were gaining ground in targeting commercial aviation as a polluter. Airbus was ramping up its “green aviation” efforts.

Tom Enders, the CEO of Airbus, was skeptical. What if Airbus committed to the re-engining and Boeing went with a new airplane? What if Airbus got it wrong? It was a multi-billion-dollar gamble.

Unbeknown to Airbus, officials worried about the wrong airplane. Airbus believed Boeing was going to offer a new single-aisle design. To be sure, Boeing had shown concepts of such a plane to customers. And no firm decision had been made internally by Boeing what direction it would go. But some within Boeing were pushing hard for a new twin-aisle concept called the New Light Twin. Those within Boeing at the time said years later this was the favored solution.

This twin-aisle airplane concept carried 180 to 225 passengers with a range of up to 4,500nm. It was a composite with a novel elliptical or ovoid shape. This airplane would rely on ground-breaking production techniques, which in many respects was key to the entire business plan. It would have single-aisle economics. What’s more, a key benefit to the airlines was that twin aisles allowed a rapid turnaround at airport gates. It was a family for three airplanes.

Forcing Boeing’s hand

Leahy was convinced Airbus could force Boeing’s hand into forgoing the new airplane and instead decide to re-engine the 737. Leahy and his strategic team believed a re-engined 737 would be inferior to the re-engined A320. They believed an “A320RE” (re-engine) would at long last give Airbus a clear advantage over the 737NG and a 737RE. For a lot of technical reasons, they were convinced a 737RE could not be competitive with the A320RE.

Leahy now had to persuade Enders and the executive board. He said that what was needed was a significant order from a key Boeing customer to shock Boeing into making this move. The dynamics in the U.S. at the time were stacked against Airbus, however. American, Delta, Southwest, and United were all key Boeing customers. Each had large 737 fleets. American had signed a deal in the mid-1990s to buy exclusively from Boeing.

Southwest owed its very existence to Boeing. When Southwest was a three- or four-airplane operator facing financial calamity, Boeing helped the airline stay in business. The odds of Southwest buying from Airbus were virtually nil.

Delta and United flew A320s. But Delta, like American, had been an exclusive Boeing customer. Its Airbuses came into the fleet after it acquired Northwest Airlines. With the merger came Northwest’s management, who eventually took over at Delta. They liked Airbus but did not like becoming launch customers of new technology engines. It was a view that in retrospect would prove prescient.

United’s A320 fleet was ordered by a long-gone management team. Although the merged airline was branded United, in reality, Continental was the surviving carrier. The remaining executive team mostly came from Continental. It was the third U.S. airline to become an exclusive Boeing customer by contract. The Continental management, now in control at United, wasn’t receptive to Airbus.

Targeting American

American’s predicament presented just the kind of opportunity that Leahy relished. By 2011, American was in a dire financial condition. It also had one of the oldest fleets of any carrier. It had some 300 aging Boeing MD-80s, purchased initially from the McDonnell Douglas, beginning in the 1980s when MDC was an independent yet struggling commercial airplane manufacturer.

Eccleston was friends with American’s chairman, Gerard Arpey.

“I had known and done deals with Gerard Arpey and some other American folks in my other careers in the past, mostly at Rolls-Royce,” Eccleston recalled. “I got to know Gerard really well, and I was quite close to him and his wife personally. I used my relationship with Gerard and with Tom [Horton] to at least initiate a debate. That debate mostly involved having nice dinners at the Mansion at Turtle Creek [a posh Dallas restaurant and hotel] once every quarter or so to sort of stay in touch.”

In early 2011, Eccleston’s conversations with American heated up.

Eccleston recalled it became apparent that American was nervous about Boeing getting to know too much about this discussion. Talks progressed to the point of nearing a deal by the spring. It was time for Leahy to become personally involved. A confidential lunch meeting was arranged in Ft. Lauderdale in March with Horton and a few key staff members. Eccleston agreed with a restaurant to open privately for lunch to be sure it remained confidential. By the end of the meal, Leahy concluded American was serious, and a deal could possibly be done. It was a blockbuster, too: more than 400 ceos and neos.

A deal could be done

“It became apparent to us that there was a deal to be done and that Tom Horton (American’s president) would be able to convince Gerard to set aside his concerns about working with Airbus. This was going to be a great airplane, and it was going to be a great deal. It would transform American’s future. They would show a lot of confidence in the future by placing an order of around 200 airplanes.” An equal number of options would be part of the package, but then a big wrinkle appeared.

“Suddenly, one day, American called up,” according to Eccleston. “Horton says, ‘So, how would Airbus feel if we ordered Airbus and Boeing, and we took both?’”

“Why would American say that?” Eccleston asked in wonderment.

“You remember when we had this agreement back in 1997 about exclusivity [with Boeing], and we were one of the three airlines?” Horton said.

“Yes, I’m aware of that, but that went away when Boeing bought Douglas and the European Union (EU) said that’s dead. So, as far as I’m concerned, Tom, you don’t have to worry about that.”

Horton replied that there were some people in the room at the time with Crandall and Ron Woodard when the exclusive agreement was signed. “They feel it’s kind of a commitment to Boeing, and they’re nervous about walking away from that.”

Boeing would be upset

It was clear that American was very concerned that if they just bought an Airbus, then Boeing was going to get really, really upset, Eccleston recalled. Horton pressed Eccleston about the Airbus reaction if American also ordered the 737.

Eccleston’s assessment that Boeing would be “really, really upset” was on the mark. “The next thing was, and this is really weird, I had a call from Horton saying, ‘Boeing said if American bought Airbus with or without Boeing, Boeing was going to sue American for breaching the exclusivity.’ We would like to ask Airbus if you would indemnify us against that,’ Horton said.”

Airbus quickly rejected the suggestion.

The next thing Eccleston heard was that Boeing showed up in American’s headquarters in Dallas with half a dozen people, most of whom were lawyers, to prove how serious Boeing was about suing them. “It really upset American. It really upset Tom. It kind of upset Gerard, who is a very mild-mannered man and doesn’t upset easily,” Eccleston recalled.

In the end, the deal included Airbus and Boeing. But for the latter, it was a near thing. Had it not been for Arpey’s call, Boeing would have missed out on a huge American order.

Asleep at the Switch

Why did American open the door to Airbus with the exclusive Boeing deal in place? “Boeing was asleep at the switch,” recalled an American official, still with the carrier in 2020. American had been asking Boeing for an upgrade to the 737NG in response to the A320neo. Boeing didn’t believe American would leave the exclusive agreement. Thus, the opportunity for Airbus. “It caught a lot of people by surprise. Boeing was pressed into doing something,” an American insider said years later. “Some didn’t want to have their hands tied to the 737RE.”

American’s precarious financial condition was also a factor for Boeing, recalled a Boeing insider. Airbus and Boeing agreed to backstop the financing of 230 airplanes. “There was a lot of debate if we should even be doing the deal because of their financial condition,” the Boeing insider said. Indeed, on November 29, just five months after the record-setting $40 billion order, American filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The filing eliminated the financing commitment if the purchase contracts were later “assumed,” a legal term that means the orders survived the bankruptcy. American assumed both contracts.

American fleet planners found the neo economics compelling, especially compared with the aging MD-80 fleet, said the American insider. But Boeing, he relayed, was confident American would not order from Airbus, and it didn’t up its game, offering only more 737-800s and a batch of -900ERs. American simply had no interest in the latter airplane.

Rushing to launch

Arpey was the bearer of bad news in 1994 when he called Leahy about the looming exclusive Boeing deal. Now he called Boeing to tell them Leahy was at American’s headquarters ready to sign a deal for 400 aircraft, a former Boeing employee recalled seven years later. If Boeing wanted a piece of this deal, Arpey said, Boeing needed to get on an airplane and get down to the airline’s Ft. Worth, Texas, headquarters, said the former employee.

This was a Tuesday. Boeing salesmen spent all day and night Wednesday coming up with a re-engined 737 program, terms, and conditions. Jim McNerney, then the CEO of The Boeing Co., stepped in and decided to launch the re-engined 737, killing Albaugh’s dream, and that of many others, of an entirely new airplane.

On July 20, 2011, American announced the dual orders at the newly opened Admirals Club at the Dallas/Ft. Worth Airport. Arpey, Horton, Airbus CEO Enders, and BCA’s CEO Albaugh were present. Leahy, Eccleston, and a host of others from Airbus, Boeing, and American were there as well.

Airbus succeeded in forcing Boeing to re-engine the 737. Leahy had his deal from a major Boeing customer. The future for the A320neo was now secure. The prospect of Boeing launching a new airplane was dead, for now. For Boeing, the decision to drop a new airplane in favor of the 737RE would prove to be a fateful one because the 737RE would eventually become known as the 737 MAX

Phoenix Police Department to upgrade fleet with five new H125 helicopters - Airbus,"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0wOS1waG9lbml4LXBvbGljZS1kZXBhcnRtZW50LXRvLXVwZ3JhZGUtZmxlZXQtd2l0aC1maXZlLW5ldy1oMTI10gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Grand Prairie, 16 September 2021 – The Phoenix Police Department has signed a new order to upgrade its airborne law enforcement helicopter fleet with five new H125 helicopters. Deliveries are expected to begin next year.

“We spent a lot of time analyzing which platform would best fit all of our operational needs as we began to renew our fleet, and the H125 met all of our requirements,” said Paul Apolinar, chief pilot at Phoenix Police Department. “Our responsibility is to protect and serve the Phoenix community, and these aircraft will allow us not only to protect from the skies, but to perform rescues in remote locations all over Arizona. We needed an aircraft that excels in hot temperatures, and the H125 is really the best aircraft for the job in such conditions.”

Known for its power, versatility and excellent performance in hot and high conditions, the H125 features dual hydraulics, dual channel FADEC, a crash resistant fuel system, and advanced glass-panel cockpit displays. The H125 accounts for nearly half of all intermediate single engine helicopters delivered for airborne law enforcement missions in North America over the last decade. It is built at Airbus Helicopters, Inc.’s production and completion facility in Columbus, Mississippi, by a team made up of 40% U.S. veterans.

“The H125 is one of the most popular law enforcement helicopters in the U.S., for good reason,” said Ron Kelley, airborne law enforcement segment manager at Airbus Helicopters, Inc. “Its versatility and high performance make it an ideal platform for diverse law enforcement missions, including aerial surveillance and search and rescue, and is a proven solution that’s consistently ready for the call when it’s needed most.”

Airbus Helicopters Inc. is the leading supplier of helicopters in the United States, with a presence dating back more than 50 years. A team of more than 700 employees operates local production and completion facilities for the H125 and UH-72 Lakota aircraft in Columbus, Mississippi, and provides world-class training, aftermarket support, and technical assistance from Grand Prairie, Texas, for the North American regional in-service fleet of nearly 3,100 helicopters.

September 21, 2021, ©. Leeham News: Airbus helicopter division presented their entry for the UAM market today at the Airbus 2021 Summit in Toulouse.

It was a presentation of a vehicle and ecosystem that has been cooking for years. After two demonstrators that tested different aspects of eVTOL flight and thousand of hours on supercomputers and in wind tunnels, the final CityAirbus is here, Figure 1.

Its configuration is as unique as Airbus’ approach when presenting it.

A rather different presentation of a rather different UAM

The presentation of the CityAirbus was different from the multitude of UAM launches we’ve seen over the last years:

It didn’t boast fantastic numbers for payload, speed, or range. It will transport one pilot and three passengers 80km (43nm) at a modest 120km/h (65kts).

It highlights sound as the most important parameter for its conception. It generates below 65dB(A) on flyover and below 70dB(A) during landing. Noise will determine if air mobility will be accepted in the cities according to Airbus.

It’s not a concept or even an early design. It’s in detailed design (check our Corner series about aircraft development to understand what this means) and will fly the first prototype in 2023, with Certification expected in 2025.

It’s not launched to the tune of “and we will produce thousands and conquer the market in X years.” Instead, the launch emphasizes that the key problems with UAMs are not the vehicle technologies but acceptability to a society where it adds an additional mobility layer, but it also adds inconveniences such as noise. If wrongly introduced, a UAM system risks rejection by society.

The introduction will, therefore, initially focus on clear benefit areas to society like faster medical transportation and mobility to areas that have none today. And the introduction will be step by step: “We are building a completely new ecosystem. It will take time and needs the cooperation of a lot of stakeholders. Do it wrong and it can misfire” says Airbus Helicopter CEO Bruno Evan.

A unique technical solution

The CityAirbus has a technical solution different from all other UAMs I’ve seen. Behind it lies over 200 flights with Airbus Vahanna and CityAirbus, where each demonstrator tested different parts of the UAM problem.

Vahanna explored vertical flight together with wing-borne flight, whereas CityAirbus focused on the operation of eight redundant lift propulsors in ground effect. It also explored the sizing problem known from helicopters. You can’t predict your problems using scale models as your challenges multiply with size. Therefore CityAirbus was large where Vahanna was not.

Airbus used these experiences together with thousands of hours with supercomputers and wind tunnels to study how propellers for VTOL generate noise but also how the stability of the propeller changes when you go from vertical propulsion to horizontal mode.

The result was a vehicle that has no movable parts except the rotors. Control of flight is 100% through an individual change of rotor RPMs. The CityAirbus has eight rotors with six working vertically from a main wing that also gives aerodynamic lift when flying forward.

Where it differs are the rear rotors which are canted to get a combined vertical and horizontal forward thrust. It means hovering is done with a slight tilt back to compensate for the rear rotor’s forward thrust component.

Forward flying tilts the CityAirbus forward until the speed of 120km/h is reached. The unique design is done to avoid the rotor propellers experience varying loads as this can cause propeller instabilities.

A realistic battery-based system

The CityAirbus is designed to be Certified to EASA Special Condition VTOL Enhanced Category. It gets its energy from batteries, and Airbus is realistic about this technology. It results in modest performance data, which is still described as a challenge for post-2025 introduction by Airbus.

Here is someone that dares say it upfront, with this technology, you cannot fly far and fast. You can fly 43nm at 65kts.

Airbus is not seeking investors to finance the project and, therefore, can avoid the overinflated claims that riddles this industry.

Can Airbus make it with the claimed performance and timetable? It’s the most realistic approach I’ve seen so far from this industry.

Sept. 7, 2021, (c) Leeham News: My book, Air Wars: The Global Combat Between Airbus and Boeing, is now available on Amazon.

Three years in the making—delayed by the need to include the Boeing 737 MAX crisis and the impacts of Coronavirus—Air Wars is a combination of a biography of John Leahy and the 1982 book, The Sporty Game. The Sporty Game was considered the definitive book about the competition between Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and the young Airbus.

Leahy worked for Airbus for 33 years, 23 of them as the chief commercial officer for the company. Throughout executive turmoil at Airbus, and at Boeing, Leahy was the one constant salesman. Boeing officials were slow to recognize the threat Airbus and Leahy presented. The wake-up call, according to a top Boeing salesman at the time, was the 1992 order from United Airlines for Airbus A319s and A320s. United considered the airplanes superior to the 737-300/400. The order prompted Boeing to develop the 737 NG. From there, the global combat became a “bare-knuckle brawl,” as journalist Dan Catchpole put it this week.

Executives and salesmen from Airbus and Boeing were interviewed for Air Wars. So were industry leaders. My own archival resources and reporting were used as well.

The result is a book that describes the successes and failures of Airbus, Leahy, and Boeing. It describes how Bombardier came out of nowhere to become a threat initially dismissed by Boeing—but recognized by Airbus. Air Wars describes the sales campaign that launched the A380 and killed the proposed 747-500/600—but led Boeing to the 787.

Air Wars begins with the crucial sales campaign with American Airlines that led to the decision by Boeing to launch the re-engined 737 program—which later was branded as the 737 MAX. The book also dispels the myth that Boeing was hasty in designing the re-engined 737.

Many untold stories are in Air Wars, including sales campaigns, product strategy decisions and personal anecdotes about Leahy—including how McDonnell Douglas tried to recruit Leahy from Airbus in the early 1990s.

A synopsis of the book is below.

Author’s Note

Read how Scott Hamilton came to tell the story of Air Wars, John Leahy, the strategies of Airbus and Boeing, and the Global Combat between them.

Forewords

From Allan McArtor, former president of Airbus Americas, airline executive, and administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration.

Introduction

The set-up of the global competition between Airbus and Boeing.

Chapter

The Multi-Billion Dollar Gamble

Airbus wanted to re-engine the A320 family. Boeing leaned toward developing a new airplane to replace the 737. This chapter tells how Airbus gambled that the A320neo would force Boeing into re-engining the 737 instead. It was a gamble that John Leahy had to persuade the Airbus CEO and Board of Directors to take. For Boeing, the re-engined 737 was branded the MAX.

Flying Cargo

This chapter introduces the early year of John Leahy.

Piper

After college, Leahy applied to American Airlines for a finance job. Rejected, he applied to general aviation manufacturers. Piper hired him, where he made his mark in financing and marketing.

Early Years at Airbus

In the process of transferring with Piper to Europe, a headhunter instead convinced Leahy joining Airbus was the better choice. Leahy’s first assignment was to close a major deal with Pan American World Airways. Sales campaigns with Northwest Airlines and others followed, some successfully, some not.

High Risk, High Reward

By the 1980s, Boeing dominated the jet age since its dawn in the 1950s. Conservative and convinced Airbus was another European jobs program, Boeing was unwilling to take big risks. As the upstart, Airbus was more than willing to take high risks for high rewards.

Facing Off

By the 1990s, Airbus produced the A300/A310 and A320 families. McDonnell Douglas was down to the MD-80, the final years of the DC-10, and the new MD-11. Boeing had a successful family of airplanes with the 707 through the 767. Now, Airbus launched the medium-range A330 and the long-range A340. Boeing countered with the 777-200 in another face-off.

The Death of McDonnell Douglas

By the mid-1990s, McDonnell Douglas Corp. slipped to No. 3 behind Boeing and Airbus. In a move that could have changed dynamics, MDC tried to recruit John Leahy to become the chief salesman for Douglas Aircraft Co. Imagine how things might have changed had Leahy joined MDC and later moved to Boeing with the 1997 merger between Boeing and MDC.

The Wake-Up Call

Despite Airbus’s growth Boeing didn’t take Airbus or Leahy seriously until United Airlines rejected the 737-400 in favor of the A320 and A319 in a 1992 sales campaign, breaking Boeing’s monopoly at UAL. It was a stunning wake-up call for the Seattle company.

Launching the A380

Learn how Airbus defeated Boeing for the launch order of either the A380 or the 747-500/600.

Moonshot

Boeing lost launching the 747-500/600 but it had something better in mind, a concept called the 7E7, which became the 787.

Troubles in Toulouse

Despite ostensibly being one company, Airbus in reality was several companies. An industrial snafu on the A380 blew up the uneasy alliance and led to executive office turmoil.

Try, Try Again

Lulled by Boeing’s failure to launch the 747-500/600 and fanciful Sonic Cruiser, neither Airbus—nor Leahy—took the 787 seriously. But a response was needed, and Airbus created the A350. Except the first, second, and third versions met with yawns from the market. Even the final version, the XWB, missed the mark.

Falling Apart

Development of the 787 was a moonshot in international industrial design and snap-together production. It all began falling apart even before the rollout of the first airplane on July 8, 2007 (7-8-07). Things went downhill from there.

Labor Wars

Increasing outsourcing enraged Boeing’s IAM 751 labor union. It struck for 57 days beginning in September 2008. CEO James McNearny had enough. He was determined to weaken the union, even if he couldn’t break it entirely. Thus began a series of battles that ended five years later.

Upstart and Disruptor

While Airbus and Boeing were duking it out, tiny Bombardier, a regional jet manufacturer, made the bold gamble to develop a mainline jet that attacked the lower end of the Airbus-Boeing single-aisle sector. At the time, no one could foresee the consequences.

Creating neo

As with Boeing, Airbus debated internally whether to pursue a new airplane design to replace the A320, or to re-engine it. If re-engined, with what? An open rotor? A conventional engine? Despite popular belief, Pratt & Whitney’s Geared Turbofan was the mover, learn how CFM and the LEAP engine signed on first.

Launching MAX

It was well known at the time Boeing had two options when it came to a new single-aisle airplane: a new design, which was favored, or re-engining the 737. The latter was put on the shelf in the expectation that Boeing would choose the former. When Airbus was ready to win a huge order from American Airlines (Chapter 1), Boeing responded within 48 hours with what became the MAX. In light of later allegations following two MAX accidents that Boeing rushed the design, the reality is different.

Grounding

Two near-disasters involving fires on the 787 led the Federal Aviation Administration to ground the airplane for three months while a fix was developed.

X-Factor

The Airbus A350-1000, in a slightly modified design, would render the Boeing 777-300ER obsolete. Boeing had to develop a response. Rather than creating another new airplane at a time when the 787 program was still finding its legs, Boeing chose to proceed with a derivative of the 777, the 777X.

Smashing a Bug with a Sledgehammer

Having dismissed the threat posed by the Bombardier C Series, Boeing woke up in 2016 following a near-miss at United Airlines and an unrelated victory for Bombardier with Delta Air Lines. Boeing filed a trade complaint with the US Department of Commerce, charging Bombardier with price dumping. In the hyperbolic filing, Boeing claimed that if left unchecked, Bombardier would destroy Boeing and the entire US aerospace industry. The irony: if left alone, Bombardier may have gone into bankruptcy. Because of the trade complaint, Bombardier sold the C Series program to Airbus, strengthening its single-aisle product line.

The Boeing-Embraer JV

While the trade complaint was underway, Boeing and Embraer agreed to create a joint venture, in which Boeing would own 80% and control through the management and the Board of Directors. The JV would help develop Boeing’s New Midmarket Airplane and a new family of single-aisle jets.

Last Gasp

With the A380 a sales failure, Airbus was nevertheless loath to give up on the airplane without one last try. Boeing, meantime, recognized at long last its queen of the skies, the 747, had become an old spinster. Boeing debated as far back as 2008 whether to kill the program then, recognizing in 2004 that the 777-300ER was the beginning of the end for the airplane.

The Alphabet Airplane

Boeing began debating internally in 2012 what its next new airplane should be. The names were variously the Middle of the Market airplane (MOM), New Light Twin (NLT), New Small Airplane or New Single Aisle Airplane (NSA), or the New Midmarket Airplane (NMA). But officials couldn’t make up their minds.

Grounding

By the first quarter of 2019, Boeing was flying high. The stock price was at record levels. Profits were in the multi-billions of dollars. Shareholders were reaping dividends and from stock buybacks. Even the October 2018 crash of a five-month-old 737 MAX was no more than a blip. Then, a second new MAX crashed. Regulators around the world grounded the airplane for what was thought would be no more than a few months at most.

Scandals

Over the years, Airbus and Boeing were beset by scandals. The effects would last for years to come.

Coronavirus

In March 2020 a mysterious new virus that originated in China became a global pandemic. The commercial aviation industry was decimated, affecting Airbus, Boeing, Embraer, and the entire supply chain. These effects still are being felt.

Retirement

Leading up to January 2018, several key leaders at Boeing had retired. That month, after 33 years, John Leahy also retired. At the end of his career, he and his sales teams sold more than $15 trillion worth of aircraft. His long tenure in sales was unmatched by anyone.

LATAM Airlines to upgrade more than 200 A320 family aircraft with Airbus' fuel-saving Descent Profile Optimisation ... - Airbus Aircraft,"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vYWlyY3JhZnQuYWlyYnVzLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzcm9vbS9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy8yMDIxLTA5LWxhdGFtLWFpcmxpbmVzLXRvLXVwZ3JhZGUtbW9yZS10aGFuLTIwMC1hMzIwLWZhbWlseS1haXJjcmFmdC13aXTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 22 September 2021 – LATAM Airlines is to upgrade their A320 Family fleet with Airbus’ “Descent Profile Optimisation” (DPO) function – a fuel-saving enhancement to the aircraft’s on-board Flight Management System (FMS) performance database. This upgrade will be performed on over 200 of their A320 family fleet, becoming the biggest Airbus fleet equipped with this powerful fuel saving solution.

All the equipment kits required for the installation of the DPO performance software on LATAM’s A320 Family fleet will start to be delivered from the end of 2021 until early 2022.

The DPO function allows aircraft to descend from cruise altitude using only idle engine thrust, which reduces fuel consumption, bringing proportional CO2 and NOx (nitrogen oxide emissions) reductions. To further enhance the fuel reduction DPO maximises the time spent at efficient cruise level -by not starting the descent too early- and subsequently minimising the amount of time spent at an inefficient ‘level-off’ stage at the bottom of the descent –when the aircraft’s engines generate thrust to maintain level flight in dense air prior to final landing approach.

Optimisation of the aircraft’s flight trajectory is one of the key factors to further improve efficiency in cooperation with Air Traffic Control. By optimising the descent trajectories of its aircraft and reducing the fuel flow to the engines -arising from the lowest ‘idle’ thrust setting during the descent phase- thanks to the DPO function, LATAM Airlines will generate over 100 tons fuel savings per year per aircraft across their network, including constrained airports like Lima, Santiago and São Paulo. This will reduce CO2 emissions by over 300 tons per year per aircraft, representing a significant contribution to more sustainable flight operations with 60,000 tons of CO2 each year for the entire LATAM Airlines’ A320 Family fleet.

DPO is one of the several flight operations optimisation solutions offered by Airbus and its flight operations services subsidiary Navblue. Together with improved Air Traffic Management, these fuel savings solutions enable operators to start aviation decarbonisation now."
Airbus helps British Airways make history - Airbus,"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA5LWFpcmJ1cy1oZWxwcy1icml0aXNoLWFpcndheXMtbWFrZS1oaXN0b3J50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"U

K-based British Airways launched its BA Better World sustainability programme, described as its ‘most important journey yet’, in early September.

The Airbus’ A320neo has been the star of the show for the second week running thanks to its sustainability credentials.

The airline partnered with Airbus to paint one of its most modern, fuel-efficient A320neos in its new sustainability programme colours to front the campaign, attracting comments such as “this livery looks amazing” and “stunning livery” on social media.

Earlier this week, the A320neo wowed again when it took to the skies from London Heathrow to Glasgow Airport as part of a partnership demonstration co-ordinated by British Airways and also involving NATS, Heathrow, Glasgow Airport and bp.

The demo, called Perfect Flight, was a repeat of a flight staged 11 years ago to show how new technology and more efficient operations are helping aviation decarbonise.

Airbus’ Julie Kitcher heads up Communication & Corporate Affairs and drives the Company’s ambition and contribution to sustainable aerospace. She said: ""The A320neo is a great example of how far our industry has come.

“It meets all the ICAO environmental standards thanks to advances in engines, aerodynamics, cabin and flight operations. The A320neo burns 20% less fuel, which means less CO2, compared to its predecessor and is 50% quieter.

""Our commercial aircraft are also capable of flying with up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel today and we are on the path to increase this to 100%. But we are not stopping there. Together with our industry partners, we want to bring the first zero emission commercial aircraft to the market by 2035.

""BA’s Perfect Flight is a clear example of how together we can achieve impressive results.""

Significant Carbon Reduction Compared to Jet Fuel

BA’s Perfect Flight was directly powered by sustainable aviation fuel, provided by bp. The SAF, which was a 35% blend with traditional jet fuel in accordance with technical aviation specifications.

The aircraft was pushed back using one of the airline’s electric Mototok vehicles, powered by Heathrow’s supply of 100% renewable electricity. Just one of the aircraft’s engines was used to taxi to the runway, almost halving the power used to start its journey.

British Airways wanted to create a better, more sustainable future. This new project (and livery) name is BA Better World.

Star Quality

The A320neo was one of many upgrades introduced by Airbus to help keep the A320 product line’s position as the world’s most advanced and fuel-efficient single-aisle aircraft.

It did just that and today overall the A320neo Family is the most successful aircraft family ever with 60% market share and 99.7 operational reliability.

More than 1,900neo Family aircraft have been delivered since Entry into Service in 2016, helping save 10 million tons of CO2 to date.



The improved environmental performance is thanks to Sharklets which help improve wing dynamics, cabin innovation and optimisation and new generation fuel-efficient engines.

BA’s campaign aircraft features LEAP-1A engines from CFM International and has been gracing the skies for BA since April 2018. The other engine option available to customers is Pratt & Whitney’s PurePower PW1100G-JM geared turbofan.

Next Destination

From 2023, the A321XLR is the next evolutionary step for the A321neo Family. It will build on the success of the A321LR and will fly up to 4,700nm / 8,700km which is a 15% increase compared to the A321LR. It will also have a 30% lower fuel burn per seat than previous generation competitor aircraft."
Airbus Unveils Latest Generation of CityAirbus eVTOL Aircraft - FLYING,"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZseWluZ21hZy5jb20vYWlyYnVzLW5leHRnZW4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has unveiled the latest generation of its CityAirbus electric air taxi, NextGen.

The announcement came Tuesday during the company’s #AirbusSummit on “Pioneering Sustainable Aerospace” held in Toulouse, France.

The new remotely piloted aircraft is equipped with fixed wings, a V-shaped tail, and eight electrically powered ducted propellers as part of its distributed propulsion system. It is designed to carry up to four passengers in a zero-emissions flight in multiple applications.

“We are on a quest to co-create an entirely new market that sustainably integrates urban air mobility into the cities while addressing environmental and social concerns,” Bruno Even, Airbus Helicopters CEO, said in a statement. “Airbus is convinced that the real challenges are as much about urban integration, public acceptance, and automated air traffic management, as about vehicle technology and business models. We build on all of the capabilities to deliver a safe, sustainable, and fully integrated service to society.”

The company says NextGen is being developed to fly with a 80 km (50 mile) range up to a cruise speed of 120 km/h (75 mph), making it well-suited for operations in major cities for a variety of missions.

Acknowledging that sound levels are a key factor for an urban mission, Airbus says NextGen is being designed to have sound levels below 65 dB(A) during fly-over and below 70 dB(A) during landing. It is optimized for hover and cruise efficiency, while not requiring moving surfaces or tilting parts during transition.

CityAirbus is one of two eVTOL aircraft currently under development at Airbus.

The first-generation CityAirbus made its first unmanned flight in 2019.

Project Vahana launched in 2016 and features a self-piloted, all-electric, single-seat, tilt-wing demonstrator. It completed its first successful flight in 2018 in Oregon.

The Vahana and CityAirbus demonstrators have jointly conducted 242 flight and ground tests and have flown around 1,000 km (621 miles) in total. Furthermore, Airbus has used extensive subscale flight testing and wind tunnel campaigns and has leveraged its computing and modelling power.

NextGen is in a detailed design phase and the prototype’s first flight is planned for 2023.

“We have learned a lot from the test campaigns with our two demonstrators,” Even said. “The CityAirbus NextGen combines the best from both worlds with the new architecture striking the right balance between hover and forward flight. The prototype is paving the way for certification expected around 2025.”

The company says as part of its eVTOL effort, it’s working with “partners, cities, and city inhabitants in order to create the ecosystem that is essential to enabling this new operating environment to emerge in a true service to society.”

Airbus is just one of many companies racing to develop and certify electric powered hovering air taxis aimed at improving the environment and easing urban traffic congestion on the ground. In addition to Airbus, major players include:"

The new agreement extends the contract for a multi-year period to secure long-term flexibility and reliability to GAMECO’s inventory management.

Five years ago, GAMECO became the first customer in China for Satair’s AMI solution which supports aviation customers in reducing their inventory holding costs for high-usage and non-repairable Airbus proprietary parts.

Andy Lee, Managing Director, Satair China, highlights: “Since 2016, the AMI service has contributed to a reduction of AOG order rate, increase of the material availability and planning accuracy at GAMECO.”

AMI is a fee-based service offering that automatically replenishes customers' frequently consumed inventories of low-value, non-repairable parts at their facilities. This is done through monitoring of consumption through messages which generate orders for replacement parts electronically and refill the stock according to agreed inventory levels. The bigger the turnover of parts, the lower the service fee, and the scope of part numbers managed can be in the hundreds or thousands.

With AMI, GAMECO supports more than 350 Airbus aircraft operating in China consisting primarily of Airbus A320 family, A330 and A380 for which all the part numbers scoped in the AMI solution are exclusively procured and managed by Satair.

Bart Reijnen, CEO, Satair, comments: “We are very pleased that GAMECO continues to entrust Satair with managing its expendable procurement. The past five years of service testify the great benefits GAMECO has recognised in Satair’s AMI solution including a successful reduction of priority orders. “

Norbert Marx, CEO, GAMECO, says: “At GAMECO, we continue to see the positive effects Satair’s AMI solution has on our operations, and we look forward to build on our fruitful relationship in the years to come.”

The flight, CI202 from Shanghai with 87 passengers and nine cabin crew members, had been uneventful. The landing, however, was anything but.

The final report [PDF] published by the Taiwan Transport Safety Board (TTSB) and reported in The Aviation Herald details the incident as it unfolded.

It was raining at the airport as the aircraft approached so the runway was wet (although still well within margins). The captain disengaged the autopilot at approximately 773 feet and continued the approach. The A330 touched down between 1,500 and 2,000 feet from the runway threshold and then, judging by the report, everything went to Hell.

Three seconds after touchdown, an autobrake system fault was recorded. A second after that, faults were recorded on the primary flight control computers and the spoilers were retracted. Reverse thrust could not be applied and, a few seconds later, the captain called to the first officer to assist with manual braking. Both pilots then applied full brakes and the aircraft was eventually brought to a halt.

""Seems the pilots did a good job,"" a tame Airbus pilot told The Register. ""You know it's bad when the captain tells the FO to help him on the brakes to stop the aircraft!""

As for the cause, the report pointed to the three Flight Control Primary Computers (FCPCs) becoming inoperative almost at the same time. Ground spoiler functionality needs one FCPC, autobrake arming needs two, and thrust reversers require an unlock signal from either FCPC1 or FCPC3.

According to the report: ""The root cause was determined to be an undue triggering of the rudder order COM/MON monitoring concomitantly in the 3 FCPC. At the time of the aircraft lateral control flight law switching to lateral ground law at touch down, the combination of a high COM/MON channels asynchronism and the pilot pedal inputs resulted in the rudder order difference between the two channels to exceed the monitoring threshold.""

The result was FCPC1 failing. Control of the flight system was then handed over to FCPC2 and 3 in sequence, both of which also experienced COM/MON channel asynchronism and became inoperative.

COM (Command) and MON (Monitor) is a standard protocol for Airbus Fly By Wire aircraft, with the monitor watchdog switching to another computer (command) in the event inputs diverge outside of acceptability. As our Airbus pilot put it: ""Stick monkey (or autopilot) puts in command and clever Franco-German computer monitors input for correctness.""

In this instance, the aircraft was shifting from flight to ground law as the pilot was applying the rudder (not particularly unusual, especially if there is crosswind on landing). Since the rudder deflects differently between ground and flight law a conflict occurred and the system was flagged as faulty. Then the same thing cascaded through the second and third FCPCs.

Airbus noted that it was the first triple fault at touchdown since the A330/A340 aircraft had entered service (and the electrical rudder-fitted family had put in 44.3m flight hours up to April 2020).

The immediate action taken was to remind operators of what to do in the event of such a triple failure. Longer term, however, is a software enhancement ""to address the root cause.""

According to the report, Airbus's modification, which is targeted to arrive by Q3 2022 for the A330-200 and A330-800, Q3 2023 for the A330-300, and mid 2024 for the A330-900, will include:

Decrease of the COM/MON asynchronism level for the flight/ground information treatment

Improvement of the COM/MON rudder order monitoring robustness in case of ground to flight and flight to ground transitions

Higher unitary monitoring robustness during such transitions

Avoid cascading/""domino's"" effect that leads to several PRIM fault

The Register asked Airbus for its response to the report, but the aviation giant has yet to comment.

In a world of increasing automation, the incident serves as a reminder of the importance of keeping a human backup in the loop. ®"

Seeking the most energy efficient flight - Episode 2 : Flight Trajectory - Airbus,"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA5LXNlZWtpbmctdGhlLW1vc3QtZW5lcmd5LWVmZmljaWVudC1mbGlnaHQtZXBpc29kZS0yLWZsaWdodC10cmFqZWN0b3J50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Did you know that an aircraft which sends accurate predictions of its planned trajectory is an aircraft that can improve fuel efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions? This is the idea behind the four-dimensional Trajectory-Based Operations (“4D-TBO”) Airbus is currently working on.

Coordinated by Airbus in the Single European Sky ATM Research program (SESAR), ALBATROSS* is an initiative of major European aviation stakeholders to demonstrate how several solutions - covering all the flight phases including operations on ground and during the flight - can be combined and used all together to further reduce the environmental footprint of aviation in the short term.

Through the various operational solutions put into practice, Airbus and its partners are exploring how we could further optimize Air Traffic Management (ATM) and more specifically aircraft flight trajectory thanks to real-time transmission of four-dimensional trajectory data.

*: Please note that ALBATROSS is a separate initiative from the Airbus “AlbatrossOne” wing project.

The most efficient flight

What is a 4D trajectory?

The aircraft trajectory is collaboratively designed by the aircraft operator and the ANSPs (Air Navigation Service Providers) before the flight. It takes into account the airline’s business criteria and the air traffic constraints in the concerned areas. During flight it can be updated through avionics systems, in order to integrate new constraints such as meteorological changes. The trajectory is defined in four dimensions (4D) which are composed of the three geometrical dimensions (latitude, longitude and altitude), plus the time. The Estimated Time Of Arrival (ETA) at each waypoint along the trajectory is predicted with improved accuracy and shared with the ground for better visibility by air traffic controllers (ATC).

By reducing the inaccuracy of current air traffic management prediction models, the real-time transmission of four-dimensional trajectory data has proven its incredible potential to greatly improve an aircraft’s trajectory prediction paving the way to the most efficient flight of tomorrow.

Benefits of 4D-TBO in the busiest summer time

“A typical modern-day air traffic control scenario illustrates how improved trajectory prediction could make a positive impact on an aircraft’s environmental footprint” explains Mattia Nurisso, Project Leader, and Thierry Harquin, Air Traffic Management (ATM) Cooperation Manager for Airbus.

“During periods of heavy airport traffic, such as summer holidays, air traffic controllers often divert some aircraft to holding patterns (i.e. an oval course flown by aircraft awaiting further landing clearance) to better organise arrivals queuing in the terminal area. In addition, ground control often requests an aircraft begin its descent before its optimum Top of Descent (TOD) - or the point at which the planned descent to approach is initiated - due to a lack of accurate visibility of an aircraft’s optimum trajectory.”

For the aircraft it results in flying additional time or withdrawing from its optimal trajectory, which requires more fuel consumption and consequently, increases CO2 emissions. Indeed, if flying in a holding pattern at 10,000 feet and at 220 knots, an A320neo consumes 25 kg of fuel per minute, or 100 kg for a four-minute holding.

However, by transmitting complete, up-to-date information about its trajectory, an aircraft can send air traffic control invaluable data that is essential for better decision-making.

“Improved accuracy of four-dimensional trajectory predictions reduces uncertainty margins when detecting conflicting trajectories and results in fewer alerts to controllers. This reduces the need for controller intervention and means we can fly as close as possible to the initially identified optimum flight trajectory” they explain.

Specifically, fuel savings could be up to 10 kg, or the equivalent of approximately 32 kg of CO2, if an aircraft descends from its optimum Top Of Descent (TOD). When calculated over an entire year for a European jet fleet of about 5,500 aircraft, the savings could be as high as 65,000 tons of fuel.

The Biomass satellite and disappearing 'football fields' - Airbus,"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA5LXRoZS1iaW9tYXNzLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1hbmQtZGlzYXBwZWFyaW5nLWZvb3RiYWxsLWZpZWxkc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Forests, especially tropical rainforests, are guardians against climate change. But our forests are burning. They are withering and dwindling. Our guardians are themselves threatened by climate change. A new European Space Agency (ESA) satellite mission, currently being built by Airbus, is set to investigate exactly how our forests are faring. The name says it all: Biomass.

Our forests and global climate are closely linked. Forests are huge carbon stores. They cover around one third of the world’s surface, but they store about half of the carbon bound on Earth. With their needles and leaves, they filter the carbon dioxide in the air that is so harmful to the environment and split it into oxygen and carbon. They release vital oxygen back into the air and retain the carbon.

Forests also influence evaporation, water cycles and thus the weather. Interconnected forest areas function like huge air-conditioning systems. Tropical forests also have a cooling effect on the climate. However, if temperatures rise worldwide, tropical forests may dry out and die. If the forests die, the carbon stored in them is released and their important climate-regulating and cooling function is lost.

Carbon is stored in many different types of forests, such as boreal forests, tropical rainforests, mangroves, urban forests and plantations. These forests differ in their ability to store carbon and produce biomass. But experts estimate that up to 75 % of the world's biomass is found in forests. And the forests are shrinking. On an unimaginable scale: since 2010, 11 million hectares per year, or the equivalent of roughly 30 football fields per minute!

Biomass_feels_the_heat

ESA's Biomass environment and climate mission will therefore monitor tropical rainforests. Its main scientific objectives include determining the distribution of above-ground biomass in the rainforests and measuring the annual changes in this mass.

Biomass and vegetation height are recorded at a resolution of 200 metres, intrusions in the forest system, such as clear-cutting, at a resolution of 50 metres. The spacecraft will carry the first space-borne P-band radar to deliver exceptionally accurate maps of tropical, temperate and boreal forest biomass that cannot be obtained on the ground. Biomass will achieve this using a ‘synthetic aperture radar’ to send down signals from orbit and record the resulting backscatter, building up maps of tree height and volume. To see through leafy treetops to the trees themselves, Biomass will employ long-wavelength ‘P-band’ radar, which has never previously flown in space. It will have its signals amplified to travel down from a 600-km altitude orbit down to Earth and back.

The mission will collect frequent information on global forests to determine the distribution of their above-ground biomass and measure annual changes. This unique satellite will provide a full global map of forest biomass stocks at a spatial resolution in the order of 4 ha, once every year over the life of the five-year mission, providing an entirely new dataset for climatologists to work with.

These maps will greatly improve on existing forest inventories and give vastly improved information for managing Earth’s forest resources. The data collected by Biomass will also capture subsurface geological structures in desert areas and the topography of surfaces hidden under dense vegetation. Observations from this new mission will also lead to better insight into rates of habitat loss and, therefore, the effect this may have on biodiversity in the forest environment.

Famous author Ernest Hemingway said: “Earth is a fine place and worth fighting for.” So let’s get Biomass into orbit to monitor it, learn about it and – fight for it."

Airbus Unveils a 4-Passenger Electric Air Taxi to Help City Dwellers Get Around Town - Robb Report,"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbW90b3JzL2F2aWF0aW9uL2FpcmJ1cy1jaXR5YWlyYnVzLW5leHRnZW4tZmx5aW5nLXRheGktMTIzNDYzNzQwMC_SAVxodHRwczovL3JvYmJyZXBvcnQuY29tL21vdG9ycy9hdmlhdGlvbi9haXJidXMtY2l0eWFpcmJ1cy1uZXh0Z2VuLWZseWluZy10YXhpLTEyMzQ2Mzc0MDAvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After spending most of its history focused on flying travelers between countries and continents, Airbus now just wants to help commuters get around town.

The European aerospace company unveiled a brand-new flying taxi called the CityAirbus NextGen earlier this week. Heavily informed by Airbus’s past eVTOL concepts, the zero-emission aircraft has two main focuses: running quietly and covering short distances quickly.

Airbus isn’t getting out of the jumbo jet business anytime soon, of course, but the announcement of the electric aircraft represents a significant commitment to the burgeoning urban air mobility sector—yet another indicator that air travel is shifting rapidly and seismically.

The CityAirbus NextGen itself looks just like one of the company’s helicopters, only with a fixed set of wings and V-shaped tale. The aircraft has room for four passengers and is powered by a unique propulsion system that features eight propellers (six on the wing, two on the tale). Since it will be flying around areas where people actually work and live, Airbus has placed an emphasis on reducing noise as much as possible. To that end, the propulsion system is optimized for hover and cruise efficiency, producing sound levels below 65 dB during flight and 70 dB during landing.

It’s still got plenty of zip, though. The eVTOL, which can be piloted remotely, will have a flight range of 50 miles and be able to reach a top speed of 75 mph. That may not seem all that impressive, but it’s more than fast enough to get you around town, especially since you get to skip over any car traffic. A trip from Manhattan to Brooklyn, for instance, would take no more than a few minutes.

“We are on a quest to co-create an entirely new market that sustainably integrates urban air mobility into the cities while addressing environmental and social concerns,” Airbus Helicopters CEO Bruno Even said in a statement. “Airbus is convinced that the real challenges are as much about urban integration, public acceptance, and automated air traffic management, as about vehicle technology and business models.”

As promising as the CityAirbus NextGen may look, it’s still only in the design stage. Airbus does hope to built its first flight prototype by 2023, though. If all goes to plan, don’t be surprised if you’re hailing an Airbus flying taxi for the final leg of a trip before the decade is out."

Airbus maintains a close cooperation with the customers to understand and provide them solutions to operational issues they report, being proactive in proposing safety enhancement solutions that will facilitate the operations.

Operational safety Airbus Defence and Space supports a fleet of over 1,200 in-service military aircraft, utilised by some 110 military and institutional operators worldwide. The company is committed to achieving the highest levels of safety performance, as well as being recognised worldwide as a reference in military aviation safety through its accident and incident prevention activities and operations. The “No aircraft accident is ever acceptable” principle – established in commercial operations – is extended to the military aviation sector. Military aircraft safety must be at the highest levels for all operations, beginning with regular transport duties to such specific military missions as air-to-air refuelling, aerial delivery, surveillance, low-level and formation flights, along with research and development. Airbus exchanges information with customers on operational experience, with the purpose to continually increase safety standards. Capturing information about in-service events is one of the key contributions enabling Airbus to enhance the safety of the company’s products and services. Technical visits also are made to operators, with maintenance technicians and pilots visiting squadron bases and other locations to directly answer questions from the crews that fly and maintain Airbus aircraft.

Safety in training Airbus provides military aircraft and mission-focussed training to flight crews and maintenance personnel, making significant investments in full-motion simulators, procedural training devices, computer-aided training, and e-learning systems. Initial Operative Experience (IOE) training is available to customers in their respective countries, updating them on the operation of their aircraft. The company issues Flight Operations Briefing Notes (FOBN) aimed at providing background information, operational recommendations, and training guidelines to enable the implementation of conclusions from the company’s diverse military aircraft working groups. As a result, experience gained during development, certification, and in-service support programmes is offered for the benefit of the complete Airbus military aircraft community.

Safety in maintenance Airbus Defence and Space is aware of the importance of proper maintenance in the safety of its products. The company works closely with customers to support their maintenance teams, covering the scope from ensuring adherence to existing maintenance procedures and inspection schedules, applying service bulletins and airworthiness directives, as well as developing new services that simplify and optimise customers’ maintenance organisations. Airbus also promotes advanced maintenance techniques, such as the Life-Time Monitoring System (LTMS), which is a structural health tool providing tailored maintenance based on in-service aircraft behaviour data, contributing to the anticipation of maintenance operations and the reduction of aircraft immobilisation.

Safety cooperation and participation in safety workshops Airbus organises workshops with its customers, per programme, within the annual operators’ conference. These workshops are mainly focussed on listening to the main safety concerns of the military aircraft operators and providing the required support for all safety issues and areas of concerns. All of these international exchanges with relevant stakeholders are essential for Airbus to enhance the safety of its products and thus, be recognised worldwide as a leader in aviation safety.

Is the Airbus A330 a Potential VLAT? | AerialFire Magazine - AerialFire Magazine,"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vYWVyaWFsZmlyZW1hZy5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8xNC9pcy10aGUtYWlyYnVzLWEzMzAtYS1wb3RlbnRpYWwtdmxhdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Numerous fires have ravaged the south of France during their summer months and concerns persist about increasing wildfire risks in the years to come. A new tool could however join the fight against devastating wildfires.

VLAT aircraft have had much success in the aerial firefighting industry, even with the retirement of the world’s largest VLAT, the Global Supertanker, whose funding was pulled earlier in 2021. The former global supertanker was recently seen after its sale to National Airlines as a freight carrier decked in a National logo just last week.

The idea of new VLAT technology development is far from over, however. Coulson Aviation has proven with the continual growth of their 737 Fireliner aircraft. In a recent article published in French media, a new idea has been gaining traction in the European market. That of a VLAT tanker aircraft based on the Airbus A330 airframe.

This idea was initially floated by airline pilot David Joubert, who was inspired by VLAT development in the US and Canada. Forming a partnership with Dominique Legendre, a professor from the Toulouse Institute of Fluid Mechanics, the two formed Kepplair Evolution. A company that has now been recognized with a patent for a retardant delivery system named Kios patented in 2019.

The Kios system invented by the pair is designed to be installed in the Airbus A330 airframe. According to the company “The interest of the project is not to replace existing firefighting equipment and modules but to provide additional assistance to public authorities” explains David Joubert.

The Kios system touts the capacity to drop more than 10,000 gallons (40,000 liters) of retardant which is four times that of traditional French tankers currently at work around the region that are capable of dropping a maximum of 2600 gallons (10,000 liters) deploying a swath line over 1600 feet (500 meters) long and 130 feet (40 meters) wide. As with other VLAT aircraft, one of their main advantages is speed, to reach the scene of a fire in time to make a difference. The Airbus A330 having a cruise speed of 542 knots.

As with other VLAT products, Joubert’s project it touted to also have the capacity to carry vital firefighting products from site to site in addition to a full load of retardant, increasing the planned effectiveness of the aircraft, should it make it into final production, realizing the full potential of the project for service both in Europe and overseas.

Joubert also touted the economic stability of the project and the viability of bringing the aircraft to fruition, claiming that a used A330 will cost between 3 and 8 million euros (3.5 to 9.6 million USD) to purchase, and a conversion cost of between 15 and 20 million euros (17.75 to 23.68 million USD) to make it an operational firebombing aircraft. Joubert compared the cost of recent government Dash 8 water bombers in France costing a total of 400 million Euro (473,78 Million USD) or 66 million euros (78.17 Millon USD) per aircraft

French media organization Le Figaro contacted the General Directorate of Civil Security and Crisis Management, who expressed some reservations about the use of airliners to fight forest fires. Stating that the aircraft in question would seem “better suited to the fight against large established fires (California type, Siberia), without the presence of a ground component in contact with the fire”. The DGSCGC also indicates that it is now favoring “airplanes with propeller engines, more suited to the geography of European areas of operation”. The smaller Canadair CL415 and DASH8 have, for example, a “capacity for rapid rotation between fire and refueling stations or scooping sites” specifies the DGSCGC.

Kepplair Evolution, while having lofty goals as a startup with big ambitions and in need of a large cash influx to accomplish their goals, has plans of being integrated into the rescUE European civil protection mechanism, to offer the European Union “long-term contracts or one-off contracts to respond to emergencies”.

While the European Union may still be gun shy of such a lofty target, the international need for more VLAT’s has already been demonstrated over recent years where overlapping international fire needs stretched internationally available resources to their limits.

Airbus is making strides in its decarbonization effort with the launch of its new wing demonstrator, a technology modeled off how an eagle soars through the air.

On Wednesday, Airbus announced a high-performance concept that is focused on accelerating and validating technologies to enhance aircraft performance and optimize wing aerodynamics. The company aims to improve flight efficiency by looking at how an eagle soars and ""adapting the shape, span and, surface of its wings and feathers"" to a pair of aircraft wings, according to Airbus.

The scaled demonstrator, which is currently just a computer model of what the wings will look like, will be represented on a Cessna Citation VII business jet platform, though it will be compatible with any future aircraft and propulsion systems, according to the company. Airbus is still investigating other elements of the demonstrator's wing control, like gust sensors and multifunctional trailing edges that aerodynamically change the wing's surface in flight. The project will be hosted under Airbus UpNext, the company's wholly-owned subsidiary.

""Airbus' extra-performing wing demonstrator is another example of Airbus' novel technology-oriented solutions to decarbonise the aviation sector. Airbus is continuously investigating parallel and complementary solutions such as infrastructure, flight operations, and aircraft structure. With this demonstrator, we will make significant strides in active control technology through research and applied testing of various technologies inspired by biomimicry,"" said Airbus Chief Technical Officer Sabine Klauke.

The innovation is the company's latest carbon-reduction project, following its announcement of its first full-sized ""eco-wing"" prototype and its CityAirbus NextGen electric aircraft. According to Airbus, the eco-wing prototype, three of which will be built, is part of the company's ""Wing of Tomorrow"" program focused on testing the latest composite materials in wing aerodynamics and architecture and exploring how to improve wing manufacturing and industrialization for future demand.

Airbus A321LR versus the Boeing 787 Dreamliner: Which do pilots prefer for transatlantic flights? - The Points Guy,"Sat, 04 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9hMzIxbHItdnMtNzg3LWRyZWFtbGluZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Last month, JetBlue launched its inaugural flight between New York-JFK and London Heathrow (LHR) on an A321LR aircraft. Narrowbody aircraft are nothing new to transatlantic travel, but JetBlue's entry into the highly competitive New York to London route caused quite a stir.

For travelers sitting in the cabin, the experience is comparable with other transatlantic carriers, with lie-flat seats in business class and mood lighting and amenity kits for passengers in the back. But how does transatlantic flying in an A321 differ from a 787 Dreamliner for the people sitting farthest forward — the pilots?

In my career, I've spent just over 3,000 hours flying the A321 (7,000 hours total with the A320 family) and nearly 4,000 hours flying the 787 Dreamliner. As a result, I feel I'm in a good position to compare and contrast how it feels to fly the two aircraft, particularly on routes with longer flight times.

Each aircraft has its own little quirks, some of which many pilots like, others which pilots may not prefer. It's like the difference between driving a Mercedes and BMW: They both offer quite a different driving experience, but ultimately either will get you safely to your destination.

Airbus A321LR versus the Boeing 787 Dreamliner

787 Dreamliner

Starting with my current ride, the 787 was made for long-haul flight with a range of 7,500 nautical miles. It was the aircraft selected by Qantas to fly the first-ever direct flight between Australia and the U.K., a 17-hour epic from Perth Airport (PER) to London Heathrow.

The 787 is a widebody aircraft, meaning there's enough space in its 18-foot-wide cabin for two aisles. It has a wingspan of 197 feet and has a length of between 187 feet for the 787-8 to 223 feet for the 787-10. It has three fuel tanks, enabling it to carry more than 100 tons of fuel, allowing it to fly nonstop journeys between cities such as Perth and London and Sydney and New York.

Airbus A321LR

The A321LR is a descendent of the original A321, a variant of one of the most popular aircraft ever built for the short-haul market, the A320.

By adding extra fuel tanks, it has a range of 4,000 nautical miles, meaning it is able to comfortably fly routes such as London to New York City, and Miami to most of South America. As a result, it is an extremely attractive option for not only established long-haul carriers but also short-haul airlines looking to expand into lucrative intercontinental routes.

One of the main advantages for airlines is that it requires very little extra training for their crew. Pilots already rated to fly the A320 family can fly an A321LR without the need for the long (often three-month) conversion course required to move onto a larger aircraft like the 787.

The A321 is considered a narrowbody aircraft, meaning that the 12-foot-wide cabin is only wide enough for a single aisle. It is also somewhat smaller than the 787 with a length of 144 feet and a wingspan of 118 feet.

Ergonomics

To the outsider, the flight deck of an A321 and a B787 are quite similar. However, when you spend thousands of hours sitting in them, you become very aware of the similarities and differences.

The most obvious difference is that the A321 has migrated to using a sidestick located outboard from the pilot, whereas the B787 still has a traditional control column situated between the pilot's feet.

Both have their advantages, but I'm going to get off the fence here and declare that I prefer the Airbus setup, particularly for long flights.

The flight deck of an aircraft is basically our office. Not only is it our office, but it's also our dining room and our lounge. It's where we can sit for nine to 10 hours in a single stretch, so the more ergonomically designed and comfortable it is, the better we will perform.

The control column on the 787 is great for flying the aircraft, but most of the time we engage the autopilot a couple of minutes after takeoff and then leave it engaged until a few minutes before landing. With the autopilot engaged, we have no use for the control column. This would be fine on a short flight, but when we're sitting for hours on end, it just gets in the way.

You'll see most Boeing pilots with a clipboard for their inflight paperwork. This is because there are few places to store it and, more to the point, it is difficult to write with the control column in the way. As a result, we use a clipboard to keep the paperwork together and to provide a flat surface on which to keep a track of our route and fuel status.

It is also difficult to eat your food properly as you can't fit the tray onto your lap without moving the seat back away from the controls. As a result, to ensure that one pilot is able to reach the controls at all times, we sometimes have to take it in turns eating.

On the A321 however, the position of the control stick to the side of the pilot means Airbus has been able to install a fold-away tray table. Once airborne with the autopilot engaged, just like on the 787, the pilots are able to pull out the table and use it to complete their paperwork and eat their meal, just like being at a proper desk or table.

The absence of the control column also means it's much easier to get comfortable in the seat as we are not restricted as to where our legs can go.

Winner: Airbus A321LR

Ride Comfort

We've all been there: Just as the meal service starts, the bumps begin. As you try to take a sip of your red wine, a jolt forces the glass against your chin and its contents into your lap. For most people, turbulence is just an inconvenience, while for others it's a real fear.

Turbulence is caused by variations in the wind speed and direction hitting the aircraft and affecting the lift over the wings. An increase in wind speed creates more lift, a decrease created less lift. Multiply this hundreds of times a second and you get what you experience as turbulence.

In order to counter this, designers at Boeing utilized a number of sensors around the 787, which detect and measure changes in angular velocity and air pressure. Lateral gusts of turbulence causing wind are recorded by gyroscopic sensors and vertical movement is recorded by accelerometers. Changes in air pressure around the aircraft are also detected.

All this information is sent to central processing computers which, in a fraction of a second, calculate not only what is happening to the aircraft but also what needs to be done to counteract those movements. The computers then send electrical signals to the actuators powering the control surfaces on the wings and tail to counteract the forces the aircraft is experiencing.

The result is that, as the aircraft instantly reacts to the turbulence-creating forces, the bumps you feel in your seat are reduced and feel much less significant than they would on, say, the A321.

Winner: Boeing 787

Air Quality

The A312 uses what is known as 'bleed air' to pressurize the cabin. As part of the engine operation, some air is 'bled' out of the high-pressure compression stage and then fed into the air conditioning system. This air is then used to pressurize the aircraft and keep the cabin at a comfortable temperature.

This is a tried and tested method that works well across all aircraft types, ever since the first pressurized aircraft took to the skies. But on the B787, things are different.

The 787 takes fresh air directly in from outside the aircraft via inlets located just under where the wing meets the fuselage (Photo by NOAH SEELAM/AFP via Getty Images)

Instead of taking air from the engines, fresh air is drawn in directly from outside the aircraft, forward of the engines, by two dedicated inlets on either side of the aircraft. This means the air that we breathe inside the aircraft is fresh from outside and hasn't been through the engine.

Not only does this mean that inside the cabin the air is of much better quality, but it also means there are savings to be made externally. As high-pressure air in the engines is not feeding the air conditioning system, all of it can be used to generate thrust. This means that the engines are not wasting airflow, making them much more fuel-efficient and thus reducing carbon emissions.

Winner: Boeing 787

Performance

Whilst the range of the A321LR has been increased by the addition of extra fuel tanks and tweaks to the wingtips, the wing on the A321LR is very similar to that of the original A321. As a result, particularly at heavy weights, the aircraft is quite limited to how high it can climb, as can be seen in the image below.

However, the wing on the 787 is an incredible feat of engineering. If you watch the video below, you'll have noticed just how much the wings flex as they are creating lift. This design enables the aircraft to climb to higher altitudes for a given weight than most other aircraft types.

This benefits us in a couple of ways. First, it means we can often fly above turbulence. There has been many a night flying across the Atlantic where pilots in aircraft below us at 33,000 to 37,000 feet have complained about the bumpy flying conditions while above them, at 43,000 feet, we've had a smooth ride.

Secondly, by flying higher than most other traffic, it means we are more likely to get shortcuts. As air traffic is a giant three-dimensional puzzle for Air Traffic Control (ATC), when you have more aircraft at a certain altitude, there's less opportunity for them to deviate from their planned route.

When there are fewer aircraft at your altitude, ATC can often let you fly more direct routes. This not only saves fuel but also time.

Winner: Boeing 787

Technology

Whilst the A321LR is a relatively new aircraft, it is a variation of the original A321. As a result, most of the flight deck technology is very similar to that of the original creation. However, the 787 is an aircraft designed for the 21st century and therefore has a number of technological advances which help improve flight safety.

One of the most useful features is the Head-Up Display, or HUD.

Part of learning to fly a jet aircraft is mastering the ability to flick between scanning the vital flight parameters such as altitude and speed inside the flight deck and viewing the visual picture outside the aircraft. During an approach, a pilot's eyes will constantly be darting between the two.

However, for a while now, technology has existed in military aircraft that allows pilots to continue scanning the flight parameters whilst still looking outside — it's called a Head-Up Display. A projector is fixed to the ceiling above the pilot's head and from it projects an image of the Primary Flight Display (PFD) onto a piece of glass in front of the pilot.

Whilst this feature is great during most stages of flight, it really becomes important during the approach and landing. Some approaches require pilots to fly tight turns very close to the ground, often in marginal weather conditions. The approach to Runway 13L at New York's JFK is a great example of this.

When we fly this approach, we need to keep our eyes on the runway as much as possible. The HUD enables us to do this whilst still scanning our altitude and airspeed as we fly the tight turn around the corner, as can be seen in the video taken in the simulator below.

Winner: Boeing 787

Bottom Line

Whilst both aircraft are capable of flying long-haul routes, as a pilot, my preference would be to do so in a 787 Dreamliner over an A321.

The flight deck of the A321 is definitely more practical for longer flights with the tray table making the flight deck much more comfortable and usable as both an office and dining room.

However, the A321 is still very much a short-haul aircraft updated for long-haul flying.

The 787, on the other hand, was designed specifically for long-haul routes. The performance of the wing and features such as the gust suppression system and non-bleed air conditioning mean the entire experience of a long flight is made much more comfortable for everyone on board.

As a result, both passengers and crew get off the aircraft feeling much more refreshed and less tired than they would expect."

We then toured the A350-1000 flight test aircraft MSN 0059 | F-WMIL.

The A350 final assembly line

Entering the A350 Final Assembly Line in Toulouse, a small anteroom with safety clothing belies the size of the aircraft in progress mere steps away. After suiting up in safety shoes and cap and a high-visibility vest, it was time to head to the production floor. We first headed to Station 50, where Airbus loads the A350 components that arrive on barges or by Beluga. After spending time in Station 50 having much of the interior and the front landing gear installed, A350s move to Station 40 where the aircraft really comes together. Over about two weeks the A350’s wings, horizontal and vertical stabilizers, and main landing gear are added. When finished at Station 40, the aircraft is ready to roll on its own.

We’ve put together a slideshow of some of what we saw at the A350 FAL and onboard the A350-1000 test aircraft. We’ll have much more from our visit early next week on our YouTube channel, so stay tuned!"

MARTIN COUNTY — Sheriff William Snyder Tuesday displayed a new, $5.2 million helicopter, which he said epitomizes the agency’s efforts to keep the county safe.

Shortly after the sleek, 2020 Airbus H125 landed near the Martin County Jail as a crowd watched, Snyder said the aircraft represents the future for the agency, which has relied on military surplus, Vietnam-era helicopters that are at the end of their service life and expensive to maintain.

“This is a huge day for Martin County and a big day for public safety,” Snyder said. “We have come to depend ... on our helicopters for being the backbone, the cornerstone of all of our patrol techniques.”

Snyder said the new helicopter “is fully equipped with state of the art crimefighting technology.”

“There's a half a million dollars worth of camera equipment alone,” he said.

He also said it has a special hoist that can take people from harm’s way.

“Today (Tuesday) is the first day in Martin County history that an air asset can come and get you anywhere, drop a hoist, put you in and take you up,” he said. “Our ability to save lives now is exponentially increased.”

The helicopter cost $3.2 million, though, as outfitted, the price is $5.2 million.

Snyder said afterward it’s the largest dollar amount paid for a single piece of equipment in his tenure as sheriff. He said no grants were available and that it is being paid for on a multi-year lease.

He said three years ago agency officials analyzed their “air assets” and looked ahead.

“We wanted a forward look, where would we be in three, five, 10 years,” Snyder said.

Snyder said the aging, Bell OH-58 military helicopters they currently fly are on their way out.

“That lifespan of that helicopter is over,” he said. “The only parts we could get were from the military; they were not going to support that program much longer.”

The military, he said, has no replacement, noting they only will supply a Blackhawk helicopter.

“You think I get in trouble for this thing?” he said. “Can you imagine me unleashing Blackhawks in Martin County?”

He said Blackhawks are too big and expensive, and made the agency look to the civilian market.

“There's no way to do what we do on the fly. There's no way to do it on the cheap,” he said. “And so we do the best we can with taxpayer dollars.”

They will downsize from three to two of the military surplus helicopters. The existing surplus helicopters remain airworthy, but their lifespan is coming to an end.

“We had no alternatives other than to run our helicopters in the ground and close the program,” he said.

St. Lucie County sheriff's helicopters are military surplus and supported through the so-called ""1033 program,"" a sheriff's officials said. That program handles excess military property for use by law enforcement agencies.

Stacey Hetherington, chair of the Martin County Commission, one of a number of top officials at the presentation, said residents expect the highest standard of public safety.

“The level of service that our sheriff's department provides is second to none,” Hetherington said. “And that's what the residents have said that they want.”

Herve Dussart, director of secure land communications at Airbus U.S Space & Defense, said that some vendors leverage technical standards at the core of solutions but then stray from the standard, but Airbus does not take that approach.

“If you’ve followed Airbus, then you know that on P25 and TETRA, we always contributed and comply with the standard,” Dussart said during an interview with IWCE’s Urgent Communications. “We always want to be open and compliant with the standard to bring flexibility and future-proof solutions to customers. We don’t want to have a proprietary standard—having some standard [in a solution], but … It is always the ‘but’ that is a problem, because it creates vendor locking. We want customers to benefit from an open ecosystem.”

Already widely deployed in Europe, Asia, and in Mexico, Tactilon Agnet is now available to U.S. customers, both as a cloud-based service or as an on-premises offering with the promise of integrations with both legacy radio systems and modern digital applications, Dussart said.

“We have the P25 [integration] that is in progress and will be ready soon,” Dussart said, noting that company plans to have this P25 integration in place later this year. “We have full TETRA infrastructure integrated. We also have DMR and mapping.

“We are working with the big vendor—Google Maps—for customers with more limited budgets. Some cities don’t necessarily have the funds to fully integrate their dedicated map solution, so we can use that [Google Maps] in those scenarios. We also have technology to integrate a full mapping solution that is dedicated for a city, a county, or a state. We have multiple solutions, and the customer will pick the solution that best fits the budget and need.”

Cloud-based Tactilon Agnet is hosted on the Microsoft Azure platform, and the Airbus agreement with Azure is designed to ensure that the Airbus solution for mission-critical push-to-talk communication (MCPTT) meets the strict mission-critical requirements associated with MCX services, which also include MCData and MCVideo, Dussart said.

“This product is really mission-critical grade,” Dussart said. “We’ve tested it in real conditions and to make sure that it fits every recommendation and mission critical requirement. I don’t believe that someone can come back to us and say, ‘You are not meeting some minimum requirement.’ That’s not going to happen.”

Airbus has conducted a demonstration for a North American customer that supported control of a drone flying over Helsinki, Finland, as well as voice communications, and the users experienced “no latency” during the test, Dussart said.

Airbus hopes to simplify the decisions that agencies have to make about integrating or transitioning to MCPTT, MCData and MCVideo, according to Dussart.

“We wanted to create a turnkey solution,” he said. “If you want to have a cloud-based solution, once we have a contract, we can have you up and running the next day. Everything is available immediately. The client is available through the Google and Apple Stores. You can connect through a tablet, Android phone, iPhone or iPad. We also have a solution that is browser-based, for a dispatch position. We can have a dispatch to a browser that is running on any platform—Mac, PC, Windows.

“We are working with partners to bring a complete proven ecosystem to the market to make it easy to get to the market, to please the customer and to ensure an easy transition for the customer. We want to avoid having a customer spend months and months trying to figure out what is going to work for them.”

Airbus has been relatively quiet in the North American critical-communications market during the past three years after the sale of Airbus DS Communications to Motorola Solutions that was announced in July 2017 and completed in March 2018.

Airbus is now bringing to the North American critical-communications market its broadband portfolio, beginning with the Tactilon Agnet announcement, according to Dussart.

“We wanted to come back with the right product, which we were working on—a 3GPP-based MCX solution,” he said."
"Airbus’ TwoTwenty, its first real business jet - Leeham News and Analysis","Tue, 28 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8yOC9haXJidXMtdHdvdHdlbnR5LWl0cy1maXJzdC1yZWFsLWJ1c2luZXNzLWpldC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Bjorn Fehrm

September 28, 2021, ©. Leeham News: When Airbus got the A220 airliner series from Bombardier, it also got the base for a competitive business jet.

Airbus, like Boeing, has produced Corporate Jets under its ACJ (Airbus Corporate Jets) since 1997 by converting its passenger A319, A320, A330, and A350 to one-off jets for Corporations, States, or wealthy individuals.

With the business jet based on A220-100, this changes. It’s no longer a one-off production but a fully-fledged Bizjet like the Gulfstream 650/700 or Bombardier Global 6500/7500, produced in series and with a semi-custom modular interior.

The TwoTwenty, Airbus’ entry into the business jet market

The A220 is produced for the airliner market at rate five per month right now, increasing to 14 by 2025. It forms an economic base for a business jet derivate, where an A220-100 aircraft go to a different cabin outfit location after the FAL (Final Assembly Line).

The high-end Business jet market of about 200 aircraft per year is shared between Gulfstream with its 650 and 700 and Bombardier with the 6500 and 7500. Dassault is a distant third with its 8X and from 2025 10X. It’s this market that Airbus now enters with its A220-100 transformed into a dedicated business jet.

By ferrying green A220-100s to Comlux’s completion center in Indianapolis, the production of the TwoTwenty can be smoothly integrated with the A220 airliner production.

Comlux, who is also the launch customer for the type with an order for two, fits a customizable interior based on a base cabin with a catalog of options. This is the standard in the high business jet market, where choices are wide but within predefined modules. For the TwoTwenty there are six different aircraft sections, where five can be customized, Figure 2.

The cabin variations are made front and rear of a common central conference area. Options are a frontal Galley and Crew area with crew rest or extended closet space, followed by a Business lounge area with different seatings, Figure 3.

The rear is skewed toward personal space, with a Living room area in different variants, followed by a Bedroom and Bathroom. The base bathroom has a full-size shower.

The cabin changes also introduce a higher cabin pressure and increased humidity. The cabin altitude is at all times below 6,000ft, and the addition of several CTC humidifiers guarantees a comfortable environment during long trips.

Value for money

The TwoTwenty is priced in the segment of the Gulfstream 700 and Global 7500 but offers double the cabin space. The cabin is wider and higher and about 5 meters longer, at 24 meters.

The TwoTwenty leverages the airliner pedigree to lower the operating costs of the jet. Fuel consumption per aircraft mile is slightly higher (it’s a bigger aircraft), but maintenance costs are lower. Airliner engines and systems are designed for 2,500 Flight hours per year, whereas Business jets fly perhaps 500 hours. A TwoTwenty owner will probably not make a major airframe or engine overhaul before it’s time to pass the jet to the next owner.

The trade between the larger space and lower operating costs of the TwoTwenty is a maximum range of 5,600nm versus the 7,000nm for the competition, which has a cruise speed of M 0.9 versus the TwoTwentie’s M 0.8.

So what does this mean in practical use?

Flights longer than 5,600nm pass the 12 hours mark and make up the odd percent of high-end Bizjet flights. The difference in cruise speed means a US transcontinental flight takes five hours in the TwoTwenty instead of 4 hours and 45 minutes for competing jets.

The buyers in this $70-$80m segment have a choice to make. To fly direct on the occasional 15-hour flight or prioritize space and economy for the bulk of the jet’s usage.

Is the TwoTwenty good business for Airbus?

Business jets are sold at close to list price, whereas airliner deals are made with heavy discounts. The net price for a TwoTwenty will be close to two times the net price of its airliner sibling.

Though the management of a TwoTwenty business is more elaborate, and the special cabin costs considerably more than the standard A220 cabin, there should be margins left that make the TwoTwenty a good business.

By introducing the changes after the base aircraft has finished a normal FAL production, disruption of the airliner production is avoided. The changes introduced at Comlux are separate from the A220 production line and leave an uninterrupted airliner production to tap future TwoTwenty’s from. The first TwoTwenty will leave Comlux’s completion center in 2023.

An Airbus aircraft has been selected to carry British Airways’ new teal, green and aqua marine livery and strapline “Our most important journey yet,” unveiled at the campaign launch in Heathrow.

10 million tons of CO2 savings

More than 1,900 A320neo Family aircraft have been delivered to date and they have contributed to 10 million tons of CO2 savings.

BA’s CEO Sean Doyle explained why BA’s A320neo was the right aircraft to be the Company’s campaign ambassador at the campaign launch;

“With BA Better World we’re on our most important journey yet - to a better, more sustainable future and one which will ensure the long-term success of our business. We’re clear that we have a responsibility to reduce our impact on the planet and have a detailed plan to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, including investing in more fuel-efficient aircraft, improving our operational efficiency and investing in the development of sustainable aviation fuel and zero emissions aircraft.”

Airbus’ Julie Kitcher, Executive Vice President Corporate Affairs and Communications, is a member of the UK Government’s Jet Zero Council.

She said: “It is great to see BA’s commitment to a sustainable future and contributing positively to climate change mitigation and adaptation.

“We’re delighted to be partnering with BA on this journey and feel proud BA has chosen one of our A320neos to highlight the importance of sustainability for the future of the industry. The aircraft is a great example of how we are continuously improving the environmental performance of our products and I am looking forward to seeing the new livery in the sky.

“We will achieve the ambition of a net zero carbon emissions industry by 2050 through cooperation and collaboration. This initiative is a clear example of that and we look forward to seeing many more of these.”

Powered by CFM Leap-1A engines, BA’s A320neo is part of a family of aircraft which incorporates the very latest technologies, including new generation engines, Sharklets and aerodynamics, which together deliver 20% in fuel savings and CO2 reduction compared to previous generation aircraft.

In addition, the A320neo has a noise footprint which is nearly 50% less than previous generation aircraft."
India formalises acquisition of 56 Airbus C295 aircraft - Airbus,"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0wOS1pbmRpYS1mb3JtYWxpc2VzLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLW9mLTU2LWFpcmJ1cy1jMjk1LWFpcmNyYWZ00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New Delhi, 24 September 2021 – India has formalised the acquisition of 56 Airbus C295 aircraft to replace the Indian Air Force (IAF) legacy AVRO fleet. It is the first ‘Make in India’ aerospace programme in the private sector, involving the full development of a complete industrial ecosystem: from the manufacture to assembly, test and qualification, to delivery and maintenance of the complete lifecycle of the aircraft.

Under the contractual agreement, Airbus will deliver the first 16 aircraft in ‘fly-away’ condition from its final assembly line in Seville, Spain. The subsequent 40 aircraft will be manufactured and assembled by the Tata Advanced Systems (TASL) in India as part of an industrial partnership between the two companies.

The first 16 aircraft will be delivered over four years after the contract implementation. All the IAF C295s will be handed over in transport configuration and equipped with an indigenous Electronic Warfare Suite.

“This contract will support the further development of India’s aerospace ecosystem, bringing investment and 15,000 skilled direct jobs and 10,000 indirect positions over the coming 10 years,” said Michael Schoellhorn, CEO of Airbus Defence and Space. “The C295 has proven again as the segment leader, and with the addition of India as a new operator, the type will enlarge its footprint even more, not only on the operational aspects but on its own industrial and technological development”.

Sukaran Singh, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Tata Advanced Systems Limited, said, “This is a moment of pride for Tatas and a milestone for the Indian military manufacturing ecosystem. For the first time, an Indian private company will be wholly manufacturing an aircraft in India. This endeavour demonstrates Tata Advanced Systems’ capabilities as a defence manufacturer to build globally competitive complex platforms in India.""

‘Make in India’ is at the heart of Airbus strategy in India, with the company constantly increasing the country’s contribution to its global product portfolio. The C295 programme will see Airbus bring its complete bouquet of world-class aircraft manufacturing and servicing to India in collaboration with our industrial partners, including the Tatas and leading defence public sector units such as Bharat Electronics Ltd. and Bharat Dynamics Ltd, as well as private Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises.

With a proven capability of operating from short or unprepared airstrips, the C295 is used for tactical transport of up to 71 troops or 50 paratroopers, and for logistic operations to locations that are not accessible to current heavier aircraft. It can airdrop paratroops and loads, and also be used for casualty or medical evacuation (medevac), as demonstrated during the COVID-19 crisis, using either basic litters or mobile intensive care units (ICU) with life support equipment. The aircraft can perform special missions as well as disaster response and maritime patrol duties.

The IAF becomes the 35th C295 operator worldwide, with the programme reaching 278 aircraft, 200 of which are already in operation and have booked more than half a million flight-hours.

About Tata Advanced Systems Limited

Tata Advanced Systems Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Sons, is focused on providing integrated solutions for Aerospace, Defence and Homeland Security. In less than a decade, Tata Advanced Systems has become a significant player in the global aerospace market, becoming the premier manufacturing partner for global OEMs as well as the Government of India’s Defence Research and Development Organization.

Alberto Robles, head of Airbus Helicopters for Latin America, assured that although the pandemic affected the whole world, it did not impact Airbus' plans. In both the private and military sectors, its priority will be to meet the growing demand for rotary-wing aircraft.

""We will continue to seek business opportunities in different sectors. We have multiple projects with different Latin American governments that we are currently exploring,"" said Robles.

Currently, more than 1,400 Airbus helicopters are flying in the Latin American region, of which 140 are operating in Mexico with both the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of the Navy and in the private sector. The market share is over 50%.

Although Mexico is facing budgetary restrictions and austerity in government spending, Airbus Helicopters has to respect the situation and support operators by using the resources available in order to use their helicopters in the safest way.

""It is in difficult times when companies have to demonstrate to their customers and partners that they are there to serve them. That is Airbus' vocation, to be close to our customers,” Robles added.

The head of Airbus Helicopters for Latin America mentioned that, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Mexican armed forces have demonstrated that military helicopters and aircraft have been essential tools to support citizens, whether for rescue missions, to transport vaccines or to carry doctors and supplies to remote locations.

Airbus To Introduce Boeing 787 Style 'Dimmable' Windows On New A350's - God Save The Points,"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvZHNhdmV0aGVwb2ludHMuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1uZXctZGltbWFibGUtd2luZG93cy1hMzUwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The futuristic Airbus A350 is getting a notable makeover.

For a start, like its direct competitor the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, new deliveries won’t offer window shades. Instead, for aircraft deliveries starting 2022, Airbus will offer its own version of dimmable windows.

The dimmable windows on the Boeing 787 are one of the more contested features ever introduced on an airplane, with a true love it or hate it approach taken by most passengers. To that end, Airbus claims theirs will be significantly better.

Airbus Introducing Dimmable Windows

The Airbus A350 is my favorite plane to fly on, for a variety of reasons. The Boeing 787 is another. The unique differentiator between the two, has been Boeing’s dimmable windows, which don’t require a blind.

Airbus is set to change that, with the introduction of its own dimmable windows for the A350-1000 and A350-900. The manufacturer claims these new windows will be able to go fully dark twice as fast, and will offer 100% darker solutions than any predecessors, as well as technology which blocks out heat.

Basically, that’s the Airbus design team, in partnership with their new dimmable window manufacturer, Gentex, calling out Boeing — without directly calling out Boeing. In fairness to Boeing, somebody had to go first, and the windows were a revelation when they first launched.

The Backstory: 787 Dreamliner Windows

Circa 2009, when the dimmable windows on the 787 were launched, it seemed like the “future” was really here. They look genuinely cool, and for most functions they actually are genuinely cool.

Except, of course, when they get really hot, and that heat makes its way directly onto your skin, because there’s no blind to absorb the heat. Or when you try to sleep during a day flight, and it’s kinda like trying to sleep at dusk, with just that little bit too much light still coming through to actually zone out.

I’ll never forget my first Aeromexico flight which featured them in 2014, and how wowed our audience was at the time by the design. But in the years since launch, few improvements have been made, and airlines began to get aggressive with the override settings they offer. Basically, an airline can turn them fully bright, or fully dark, without your permission.

American Airlines cabin crew were famously scolded for dimming them at the first possible opportunity, in hopes of getting passenger to sleep and avoid providing a full service on board. The airline eventually sent out a memo overruling this action.

Back To The New Airbus Dimmable Windows

As someone who’s grappled with the 787 Dreamliner windows too many times to count, both with great success and the occasional frustration, I’m encouraged by the claims made by Airbus!

If the windows genuinely go 100% darker in their blackout mode and can transition twice as fast, that’s a significant win. I often love the novelty of dimming a window and still being able to watch the clouds, and world below, but the transition can currently feel like an eternity.

The Airbus A350 has proven extremely popular with airline customers and many jets are due to be delivered from 2022 onward. It’s expected that removing the blinds from all windows will also decrease weight, which reduces fuel, which fits the environmental goals airlines are in pursuit of.

The flying taxi service will be a niche market initially, according to Director of Urban air mobility at Airbus, Markus May, but he insists the goal is to make the service available to everyone eventually.

""It's a new technology like the first mobile phone, like the first car,"" he said.

""But our ambition is very, very clear: to democratise it and provide a service to the public, to provide a service to the citizen, to the people who live in the cities"".

The zero-emissions aircraft is capable of running autonomously but the taxis will be piloted in the initial stages.

""When autonomy is ready, when the social acceptance and the safety standards are at a level which is good, then we will have an autonomous vehicle which can carry four passengers,"" Balkiz Sarihan, the Head of Strategy for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) at Airbus, said.

""But as a start, it will be three passengers plus one pilot"".

Airbus forges ahead with zero-emission aviation | electrive.com - www.electrive.com,"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZWN0cml2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8yMi9haXJidXMtZm9yZ2VzLWFoZWFkLXdpdGgtemVyby1lbWlzc2lvbi1hdmlhdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has just unveiled concrete plans for zero-emission aviation with a new generation of the battery-electric CityAirbus. Meanwhile, the aircraft manufacturer has signed an MoU with Air New Zealand to research hydrogen-fuelled aircraft, while in Europe Airbus will focus on hydrogen aviation infrastructure with Air Liquide and airport operator Vinci by 2030.

Firstly to the battery-electric aircraft that Airbus first announced in March 2019 when Audi and Airbus presented the aircraft developed as part of the Urban Air Mobility project in the Audi town of Ingolstadt in Germany. Equipped with eight electrically powered propellers, the CityAirbus NextGen aircraft will be able to carry four passengers around 80 kilometres and at speeds of up to 120 km/h. The first flight of the prototype is planned for 2023, with certification around 2025.

Airbus calls the battery-electric aircraft a “flying taxi” capable of silently flying over urban spaces. The body of the eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) aircraft features a V-shaped tail and fixed wings, its propulsion system is made up of eight electrically powered propellers. A key feature of the plane is noise reduction functions which the company says features sound levels less than 65 dBa during fly-overs and below 70 dBa during landing.

With this aircraft, Airbus Helicopters CEO Bruno Eve explains: “We are on a quest to co-create an entirely new market that sustainably integrates urban air mobility into the cities while addressing environmental and social concerns. Airbus is convinced that the real challenges are as much about urban integration, public acceptance, and automated air traffic management, as about vehicle technology and business models.”

However, before aviation for more than a few passengers becomes emission-free there are a few physical hurdles to overcome. Aviation has been identified as a key focal point for the hydrogen strategies of the USA and Germany, among other “hard-to-decarbonise” sectors such as long-haul shipping. Because of the weight of batteries, purely battery-electric aircraft are generally limited to small passenger planes. Hydrogen-powered aircraft have the benefit of the greater energy density capacity of hydrogen fuel. Here, along with its concrete plans for hydrogen aircraft, Airbus is already planning hydrogen infrastructure at airports making its first investigations into the hydrogen aircraft outlook with airlines.

In New Zealand this week, Airbus and Air New Zealand announced a joint initiative to research the ways in which hydrogen-powered aircraft could assist the airline with reaching its goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. Needless to say, many of New Zealand’s industries are dependent on long-distance travel to and from the geographically isolated island-state near the southern-most end of the Pacific ocean.

The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) lays the groundwork for Air New Zealand to analyse the impact that hydrogen aircraft may have on its network, operations and infrastructure. For its part, Airbus will provide the hydrogen aircraft “performance requirements and ground operations characteristics” in order to support the New Zealand airline in developing its decarbonisation roadmap.

Meanwhile, over in Europe, Airbus has just now joined forces with the gas manufacturer Air Liquide and the airport operator Vinci to create the necessary infrastructure for the refuelling of future hydrogen aircraft by 2030.

The first step will be taken at Lyon-Saint Exupéry Airport, where a hydrogen station for trucks and buses is to be built from 2023. In the years thereafter, the partners want to develop the infrastructure for refuelling aircraft with liquid hydrogen.

The project includes three main phases. From 2023 the three companies envisage the deployment of a hydrogen gas distribution station at Lyon-Saint Exupéry airport. This station is supposed to supply both the airport’s ground vehicles (buses, trucks, handling equipment, etc.) and those of its partners, as well as the heavy goods vehicles that drive around the airport. The partners say that this first phase is essential to test the airport’s facilities and dynamics as a “hydrogen hub” in its area of reach.

To underline the forethought and strategy in these plans, it should perhaps be noted that in June this year, Airbus was granted support from the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Technology (BMWI) and the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure (BMVI). In June this year, the German government ministries selected 62 major projects to receive government funding as part of a joint European hydrogen project (Hydrogen IPCEI), funding twelve projects in the mobility sector. Airbus was named in connection with hydrogen-powered intralogistics vehicles.

In the second main phase, between 2023 and 2030, Airbus, Air Liquide and the airport operator Vinci will be working on the deployment of liquid hydrogen infrastructures. Airbus says that this will allow hydrogen to be provisioned into the tanks of future aircraft.

In the last phase, beyond 2030 the partners will focus on the deployment of hydrogen infrastructure from production to mass distribution of liquid hydrogen at the airport. Beyond these concrete phases, the partners will be looking at the possibility of equipping Vinci Airports’ European airport network with hydrogen production, storage and supply facilities. This should be utilised for both ground vehicles as well as aircraft. Vinci Airports manages 45 airports in 12 countries in Europe, Asia and the Americas.

Airbus is now building on considerable investment in hydrogen-powered aeroplanes. In January this year, Airbus unveiled a new configuration as part of its ZEROe programme that could enable passenger aircraft to fly further than ever before with zero emissions. The so-called ‘pod configuration’ consists of six detachable fuel cell propeller propulsion systems mounted under the wings. In September last year, Airbus had given details of new hydrogen-powered aircraft studies. The aircraft manufacturer unveiled three concepts for the world’s first zero-emission commercial aircraft that could enter service by 2035. All of these concepts, code-named ZEROe, rely on hydrogen as the main energy source, but each takes a different approach. In October 2020, Airbus also launched a fuel cell aircraft partnership with ElringKlinger.

Most recently, in June this year, Airbus announced that it was gathering its efforts for metallic hydrogen tanks and establish so-called Zero-Emission Development Centres (ZEDC) at sites in Bremen, Germany and Nantes in France. The goal of the ZEDCs is to enable the cost-effective production of cryogenic tanks to support the future market launch of the ZEROe concept as well as to accelerate the development of hydrogen propulsion technologies.

"Airbus gambles on a big, fixed-wing eVTOL design - Asia Times","Thu, 23 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA5L2FpcmJ1cy1nYW1ibGVzLW9uLWEtYmlnLWZpeGVkLXdpbmctZXZ0b2wtZGVzaWduL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus, the French aerospace giant that has revolutionized air travel around the world, is boldly stepping into the new century with an advanced, next-generation, eVTOL design.

It’s all too easy to turn a jaundiced view toward any new announcement that touts big progress in eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) development. But when aerospace titan Airbus speaks, it’s hard to turn a deaf ear.

This week at Airbus’s sustainability summit in Toulouse, France, the manufacturer unveiled a design for a fixed-wing CityAirbus NextGen eVTOL with a V-shaped tail and eight sets of electric motors and propellers, AINonline reported.

An engineering team led by Airbus Helicopters is working on the detailed design for the model, with the aim of achieving a first flight with a prototype in 2023, en route to type certification in 2025.

Their potential is compelling: Air taxis could substantially cut down the travel time in heavily congested areas, turning a 45-minute trip from downtown Manhattan to JFK International Airport into just five.

Developing countries are particularly interested in the technology, given their megacities have often grown faster than the infrastructure can support.

The full electric aircraft will carry up to four passengers on flights of up to 80 km (50 miles) and at speeds of 120 km/h (75 mph).

“We have spent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours on this; on all aspects of eVTOL design,” Airbus UAM (Unmanned Air Mobility) head Joerg Mueller said, noting that Airbus has performed extensive computer modelling, conducted multiple wind tunnel tests with full-scale propellers, and set up test benches for noise research.

“We have even overflown an urban area, have measured the propagation of sound in this city and the effect it has on people on the ground . . . to see in which sense we need to optimize such a vehicle,” Mueller added.

Mueller said the lift-plus-cruise design of CityAirbus NextGen has “no movable surfaces and no tilting parts,” which makes it “simple and efficient, still while providing a significant forward flight performance.”

The aircraft will initially be piloted, but Airbus expects to move toward autonomous flight as the technology and operational framework for self-flying aircraft are established.

“We have learned a lot from the test campaigns with our two demonstrators, CityAirbus and Vahana,” said Airbus Helicopters CEO Bruno Even.

“The CityAirbus NextGen combines the best from both worlds with the new architecture striking the right balance between hover and forward flight.

“We are on a quest to co-create an entirely new market that sustainably integrates urban air mobility into the cities while addressing environmental and social concerns.”

He acknowledged that the real challenges are wide, spanning urban integration, public acceptance, and automated air traffic management, as well as vehicle technology and business models.

“We build on all of the capabilities to deliver a safe, sustainable, and fully integrated service to society,” Even noted.

Because of the urban mission, low noise levels are essential.

CityAirbus’s design calls for sound levels below 65 dB(A) during flyover and below 70 dB(A) during landing.

CityAirbus is being developed to fly with a 80 km range and to reach a cruise speed of 120 km/h, making it perfectly suited for operations in major cities for a variety of missions. Credit: Airbus.

The design is also optimized for efficiency in hover and cruise flight, without having any moving surfaces or tilting parts to handle this transition.

Airbus Helicopters’ head of development Tomasz Krysinski said his company had a key advantage over other rivals.

“We are the only company in the world that tested such a vehicle in real size,” he said, explaining that with all rotary-wing aircrafts, the complexity of the task grows with the dimensions of the vehicle.

“It’s very easy to do something with a mock-up on the small scale.”

Airbus intends to certify the CityAirbus NextGen under EASA’s Special Conditions-VTOL rules. Germany-based start-ups Lilium and Volocopter are seeking type certification on the same basis and hope to achieve this by 2024.

“The CityAirbus NextGen combines the best from both worlds with the new architecture, striking the right balance between hover and forward flight,” Even said.

First test flights for the CityAirbus NextGen prototype will take place in Paris and Munich, though Airbus executives insisted the test program will move beyond its two home markets of France and Germany.

And it’s not only city slickers in large metropolises that are expected to benefit from the program. Airbus noted that it hopes to help the likes of emergency service providers access hard-to-reach areas with the aircraft.

Airlines around the world will undoubtedly be keeping a close eye on the project.

For instance, Azul recently shared that it wants to operate 220 eVTOLs around Brazil.

Overall, Airbus wants to “make the dream of personal flight a reality.”

Ushering in the next generation of CityAirbus, the fully electric vehicle is equipped with fixed wings, a V-shaped tail, and eight electrically powered propellers as part of its uniquely designed distributed propulsion system. It is designed to carry up to four passengers in a zero emissions flight in multiple applications. Credit: Airbus.

Additionally, the aviation industry has committed itself to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. With these two ambitions in mind, the CityAirbus NextGen could provide the perfect balance for Airbus in the UAM scene.

Even estimated annual demand could be around about 1,000 eVTOLs, with the company ruling out any plans to move beyond the sale of eVTOLs into operating fleets itself.

Much like a robotaxi, the goal is for the eVTOL in the future to maneuver itself by computer in order to make the economics more viable. Human operators take up space that could otherwise be used to transport paying customers.

“We are targeting self-piloted autonomous flight,” Mueller said.

“This will progressively come, and we’ll introduce it step-by-step, so that at a certain point these vehicles fly fully autonomously. Until then, we’ll fly them with a pilot, of course.”

The project opens the way to a future hybridized propulsion system for light helicopters while delivering concrete flight safety improvements in the short term. The campaign’s main target is to enhance flight safety of single engine operations by providing emergency electrical power in case of a turbine failure.

To conduct these tests the Flightlab was equipped with a 100 Kw electric motor connected to the main gearbox, which can provide electrical power for 30 seconds in the event of engine failure. By giving the pilot extra time to react and maintain rotor speed, the engine back-up system contributes to a safer and smoother autorotation maneuver to the ground. The current flight tests include the simulation of engine failure in different flight conditions, including takeoff and landing procedures and corresponding limitations.

While evaluating the safety margins and performance benefits, the flight campaign also aims to demonstrate a performance increase, thanks to the prompt electric power input. The potential benefit in terms of Maximum Take-Off Weight is to compensate for the mass of the EBS system itself and to provide helicopter operators with additional payload.

“The engine back-up system is a good example of the incremental approach in our innovation strategy”, declared Tomasz Krysinski, Head of Research and Innovation at Airbus Helicopters. “The current EBS flights are a very important first step towards a future hybrid propulsion system and we already foresee a second phase of the project with more energy and power on board. We are looking at developing a fully parallel hybrid propulsion system mixing thermal and electrical energy together with the aim of optimizing fuel consumption and enabling hybrid single engine flights over urban areas”.

Because the EBS flight campaign also looks at ways of easing the possible introduction of this techno-brick onto future production aircraft, the various components of the system have been designed with serial production in mind.

This latest chapter introduces kids to the element at the very top of the periodic table and how it could play a key role in powering future aircraft.

Science and technology at the service of society

When today’s kids come of age, our skies will look a lot different. For one thing, they may be filled with a multitude of planes that soar to new heights without any emissions. And the new fuels and technologies that could power them – from fuels made of algae and waste to hydrogen – are already in the works.

But what is hydrogen and how can engineers use it to power future airplanes? And how can these complex concepts be explained so that even kids can understand them?

The Airbus Foundation’s Discovery Space programme has set its sights on addressing those very questions with “Flightpath to Hydrogen,” the latest chapter of the “Future of the Skies” content series aimed at kids aged 8 to 12 years old. It includes the following:

Four animations that explain key topics using characters kids have already met from previous editions

Do-it-yourself toolkits

“Our aim is to capture kids’ imagination with content that is not only fun, but also educational and inspiring,” says Rachel Schroeder, Managing Director of the Airbus Foundation. “This chapter is particularly special as it really highlights how science and engineering can address today’s critical challenges, like climate change.”

“Flightpath to Hydrogen”: a future-focused series

Hydrogen is the undisputed star of this chapter of the content series. And for good reason: this high-potential energy carrier promises to eliminate aircraft’s CO₂ emissions while significantly reducing other climate-impact emissions. But many things will need to change to enable hydrogen to fuel future aircraft, from engine technology to transport and storage at airports. Kids thus have many starting points from which to let their imaginations run wild!

Each of the four episodes explains a key topic and inspires kids to think critically about them. These topics include the following:

Future Fuels: The first episode explains the challenges of today’s fuel for aircraft and outlines why alternative options are needed for the betterment of our planet. Kids are then challenged to think about what will power future airplanes.

Custom content for educators and parents

Since 2018, the Discovery Space programme has acted as a science education partner to help educators arents engage with their children and students on STEM topics.

“Our first priority is to make the Discovery Space content relevant to kids,” Rachel says. “But we fully recognise that educators and parents play a key role in bringing content to their students and children, so we work closely with them to make sure the subject matter is tailored to their needs as well.”

For educators, the “Flightpath to Hydrogen” series can help them breathe new life into science classes dedicated to explaining hydrogen as a molecule, as well as basic engineering concepts. It can also help them nurture their students’ understanding of STEM concepts and practices.

For parents, the series can offer an educational after-school activity or a fun family night game. It can also help spark family discussions on how science and technology can lead to satisfying and meaningful careers in the future, as kids start to think about how they can put their talent and imaginations to protect our planet.

All of the content included in the series is produced in four core languages: English, French, German and Spanish. The animations will be progressively shared on the Discovery Space’s social media channels, from YouTube to Twitter."

The all- electric four-seater aircraft is being developed to meet EASA special condition VTOL certification standards, will have an 80km (50 miles) range and have a top cruise speed of 120 km/h (75mph).

The fixed-wing aircraft features a V-shaped tail and eight propellers as part of a distributed propulsion system.

The CityAirbus Nextgen is a convergence of design and learning from the previous CityAirbus and Vahana eVTOLs said Airbus. Development of Vahana was stopped in December 2019.

Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters said, “We have learned a lot from the test campaigns with our two demonstrators, CityAirbus and Vahana. The CityAirbus NextGen combines the best from both worlds with the new architecture striking the right balance between hover and forward flight. The prototype is paving the way for certification expected around 2025.”

CityAirbus NextGen is currently in its detailed design phase with its first flight planned for 2023.

Speaking at the Airbus Summit in Tolouse, France Dr Joerg P Mueller, head of urban air mobility for Airbus said, “We have already flown a demonstrator [CityAirbus] that is representative of such a vehicle, of the same scale and weight.

“The Vahana was designed for performance in cruise flight and to explore a different design. We have converged to this solution.

“There has been 242 flight and ground tests and we have covered 1,000km jointly already. We have spent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours on all aspects of the eVTOL design from structural mechanics to avionics and its controls.”

Mueller added that CityAirbus’ lack of moving surfaces or tilting parts during transition ensures the design is simple and effective and that the company is using data from its Voom helicopter service, which was shut down in 2019 after three years, for insight into how people will use the CityAirbus.

Airbus’ is targeting noise levels of below 65dB(A) during fly-over and below 70dB(A) during landing for the CityAirbus Nextgen.

“Noise is fundamental for the design,” said Mueller. “We have run test benches where we have set up propellers with different shaped blades and numbers of blades. We have overflown an urban area and assessed with partners the effect on people on the ground to find out how to optimze the vehicle.

“We have run wind tunnel tests and optimized our design tool set. We have used 31 million computation hours on supercomputers for modelling and simulation to optimise the aerodynamics and noise.”"

Unveiled at Airbus’s first summit on “Pioneering Sustainable Aerospace” on Sept. 21, the fully electric, four-seat multi-rotor aircraft features six propellers on wing-mounted booms, and two additional fixed-tilt propellers for cruise flight on a V-shaped tail. It is being developed to fly with a range of 80 kilometers (50 miles) and cruise speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) — modest targets that are nevertheless sufficient to meet the vast majority of missions in and around urban areas, according to Airbus UAM head Joerg Mueller.

Noise levels are expected to be below 65 dB(A) during fly-over and below 70 dB(A) during landing. Airbus plans to fly an initial prototype in 2023, with certification by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) anticipated around 2025.

Speaking at the summit in Toulouse, France, Mueller said that “CityAirbus NextGen” incorporates lessons from the company’s two eVTOL technology demonstrators: the original CityAirbus, a multi-rotor aircraft that is representative of the size and weight of the next-generation design; and the tilt-wing, single-seat Vahana, which was optimized for performance in cruise flight. Airbus collectively flew the demonstrators around 1,000 km over 242 flight and ground tests before converging on the NextGen design.

“We have spent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours on this; on all aspects of eVTOL design,” he said, noting that Airbus has performed extensive computer modelling, conducted multiple wind tunnel tests with full-scale propellers, and set up test benches for noise research. “We have even overflown an urban area, have measured the propagation of sound in this city and the effect it has on people on the ground . . . to see in which sense we need to optimize such a vehicle,” Mueller added.

Mueller said the design of CityAirbus NextGen has “no movable surfaces and no tilting parts,” which makes it “simple and efficient, still while providing a significant forward flight performance.” The aircraft will initially be piloted, but Airbus expects to move toward autonomous flight as the technology and operational framework for self-flying aircraft are established.

“We have learned a lot from the test campaigns with our two demonstrators, CityAirbus and Vahana,” said Airbus Helicopters CEO Bruno Even. “The CityAirbus NextGen combines the best from both worlds with the new architecture striking the right balance between hover and forward flight.”

Airbus' return to the eVTOL air taxi is a bit of a head-scratcher - New Atlas,"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2FpcmNyYWZ0L2FpcmJ1cy1jaXR5YWlyYnVzLWV2dG9sLWFpci10YXhpL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has been quiet on the eVTOL front since its original CityAirbus multirotor and Vahana programs shut down, but at its ""Pioneering Sustainable Airspace"" summit, the company released details and images of a new electric air taxi it expects to get certified by 2025 – a clean-sheet design with a surprisingly humble set of capabilities.

The new ""NextGen"" design is very pretty to look at. It appears to be a hybrid lift and cruise type design, with six vertical lift props extending out on short arms from a wide, forward-swept front wing that looks a bit like something Batman might fly when viewed from above.

Additional lift is supplied by two more rotors at the rear, which are part of a chunky V-tail design joined at the top with an additional wing surface. The rear rotors appear to be mounted on very compact tilt-rotor systems, enabling reasonably efficient forward flight – although the lift rotors don't appear to stow or fold away, so they'll add parasitic weight and drag in cruise mode.

It's only a four-seater; Airbus will initially take up one of those seats with a pilot, but the French company is definitely looking ahead to a point where these things will fly themselves autonomously.

It won't go particularly fast or far, either, a fact that's really got us scratching our heads. Airbus is estimating top speeds of just 120 km/h (75 mph) and a range of just 80 km (50 miles) between charges of its ~60-kg (132-lb) lithium-ion battery pack. Those figures are frankly abysmal in the emerging eVTOL world, particularly among similar winged designs where speed and range figures are routinely three times what Airbus is promising here.

Considering the immense effort and expense involved in bringing these eVTOLs to market, and the extra complexity and expense involved in making a transitioning airframe, it seems bizarre to us that a company with Airbus's resources would shoot so low on the spec sheet on a project this important at the dawn of a new air mobility movement.

Perhaps the team sees an advantage in keeping costs low, but every extra minute these things spend hooked up to a charger during peak operating times is money lost for whoever's operating it. Perhaps this is specifically an urban design and there's a faster, longer-range design being developed in parallel. But it's certainly got us wondering.

Airbus is highly conscious of the noise factor – eVTOLs are many times quieter than helicopters, but should they begin flooding our cities in great numbers, noise will likely be the biggest negative they bring with them. This design, says the company, should create noise levels under 70 dB in the landing phase – about the level of regular traffic, or a vacuum cleaner.

The company will progress the design through the necessary engineering, prototyping, testing and certification phases, and says it's expecting to have the NextGen CityAirbus flying in 2023, and fully certified by 2025. It doesn't plan to operate a service itself, and will instead sell the aircraft to service providers.
