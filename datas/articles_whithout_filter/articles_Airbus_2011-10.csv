My Review: Delta Airbus A330 from Amsterdam to Seattle - Airline Reporter,"Fri, 21 Oct 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMS8xMC9teS1yZXZpZXctZGVsdGEtYWlyYnVzLWEzMzAtZnJvbS1hbXN0ZXJkYW0tdG8tc2VhdHRsZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This was my last leg of my RwandAir adventure. I had already flown from Seattle to Rwanda in a 737 and just completed a 10 hour flight from Kigali, Rwanda to Amsterdam on a KLM A330. I was already pretty tired and wasn’t sure how my mind, body and spirit would do on another ten hour ride in a different A330. On the positive side, I was looking forward to comparing two international Airbus A330s back-to-back. Overall, I have to say I like the Northwest Delta Air Lines A330 long haul premium economy a bit better than KLM’s.

When arriving into Amsterdam, I had a three hour layover and I was hoping to check out their observation deck. Before plane spotting, I needed to do some charging of my laptop and cell phone, since my last ten hour flight did not have in-seat power and neither would my next one. The classic hunt for an open outlet was on.

I started down the concourse looking from side to side. I kept going and going and’¦ well, going. Seriously? After 45 minutes looking up and down concourses D, E and F, I found an outlet about seven feet up for vending machines, one in the bathroom, one on a fire hose holder and one on a center pillar in a crowded walkway. I choose to deal with the crowds and sat down on the floor (looking like an idiot by the way) by the pillar, plugged in my phone and then’¦ nothing. Sweet, this outlet did not work. Now the debate was did I want to look like even more of an idiot standing in the bathroom charging my phone, climbing on a vending machine or using an outlet on a fire hose that might cause some alarm to go off. I figured my best bet was with the fire hose and luckily it worked. The bad part was it took so long to juice up, that I wasn’t able to check out the observation deck ’“ save it for next time I guess.

I figured I might as well head to the gate, where I received my first body scan. We had to wait in a small waiting area at the gate for our flight, which had little entertainment before being able to board. I was sitting in Delta Economy Comfort, which gave me four additional inches of seat pitch, 50% more recline, priority boarding and free alcohol. You also sit near the front of the plane, which means you are first to customs after arriving in Seattle. .

Even with the extra four inches, I was unable to fully stretch out my legs since there was a huge in-flight entertainment box under my seat, negating the extra leg room. You would think with a large electrical box like that under your seat, they would at least give you an outlet, but there was none. Reading on SeatGuru.com, it looks like only Business Class has outlets. Good thing I did some charging during my layover.

One nice surprise was seeing an air vent in the overhead bin. I absolutely love my air vents, since I am normally hot and that little breeze can make a huge difference. Sure, most domestic aircraft have air vents, but I am finding more and more long haul Boeing 747, 777, Airbus A330/A330 and the A380 are lacking them.

During both legs (KGL to AMS and AMS to SEA), I had window seats. When flying on the KLM A330, I noticed that there was quite a bit of room between the seat and the wall and was wishing the outer arm rest would raise, allowing me access to that extra room. It was too bad that the armrest would not rise on the KLM A330, but it did rise on Delta’s. This gave me an extra three inches or so of seat width and I was starting to get the feeling that this might be a good flight. Unfortunately we ran into some trouble pretty quickly.

After boarding we were told there would be a delay. It turns out that the amount of fuel that the truck indicated being pumped into the aircraft, didn’t match the A330’s gauges. Delays can be annoying, but I am willing to wait to make sure we have enough fuel — I am old fashioned like that. It took about an hour to determine that the truck had the failure and after all the paperwork was completed, we took off.

When getting my free headphones given by Delta out of their plastic bag I accidently ripped one of the wires. Not a big deal, I figured I could just ring the call button and quickly get a new one. I decided to try something new; time how long it would take for a flight attendant to assist me after ringing the call button. I decided I would make eye contact with a flight attendant walking by, but I would not say anything like “excuse me,” to put them to the test.

I rang the call button and waited. And waited. And holy crap waited some more. At the 10 minute mark I turned off my call light and rang it again. During those ten minutes I had two different flight attendants walk by, but they did not stop’¦ they did not even make eye contact. At the 15 minute mark I turned off my call light and rang it again. Another flight attendant walked by, but still nothing. I could see that my call light was on and the “ding” noise was definitely making its sound.

At about 18 minutes a flight attendant came by for trash. I was waiting for her to ask me about my light, but she didn’t. I decided I really wanted to start watching a movie, so I asked her for another head phone set, which she got right away. I am not normally one who uses the call button and I have never timed it before, but I am pretty certain that 18 minutes and three flight attendants walking by is not okay. It takes a lot to get me annoyed or frustrated on a flight and this definitely did it.

When trying to relax, the recline of the Economy Comfort was great. However, when the person in front of me was enjoying their extra 50% recline, it was not so great ’“ actually pretty annoying. I am normally one that doesn’t recline my seat, since I do not want to disturb the person behind me, but I really had to recline a bit to open my laptop, even with the extra four inches.

During the flight, I was served two different meals. One was your standard airline pasta, but the second was pizza. Both of them were pretty decent and I thought it was pretty slick having pizza on the plane. I really didn’t get to enjoy all the amenities in the flight, since I slept through most of it. Having the ability to raise my outer armrest really gave me one of my best economy sleeps with someone sitting next to me. I landed in Seattle feeling a lot better than I thought I would after 24 hours of economy flight.

First Airbus A380 for Chinese carrier |Economy|chinadaily.com.cn - China Daily,"Sat, 15 Oct 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaW5hZGFpbHkuY29tLmNuL2NoaW5hLzIwMTEtMTAvMTUvY29udGVudF8xMzkwNDY4OS5odG3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"First Airbus A380 for Chinese carrier Updated: 2011-10-15 08:01 By Wang Wen and Liu Weifeng (China Daily)

China Southern looks to further its international ambitions with the Superjumbo

TOULOUSE, France - China Southern Airlines Co Ltd became the first Chinese operator of the Airbus A380 Superjumbo on Friday.

The Guangzhou-based airline, the country's largest by fleet number, will start flying the double-decker aircraft on commercial routes on Oct 17. It will begin flights from Beijing to Guangzhou and Shanghai between Oct 17 and 29.

The aircraft will begin operating on international routes within the year, when the airline's second A380 is delivered in December, said Si Xianmin, chairman of China Southern.

The carrier ordered five A380s in 2005 and they will all be delivered before the end of 2013, according to the airline.

The ticket price will be the same as other aircraft flying on routes. The price of an economy class seat between Beijing and Guangzhou is 1,700 yuan ($266).

China Southern unveiled its A380 cabin featuring 506 seats - 428 in economy class, 70 business class seats and eight first class - at the delivery ceremony.

""The economics offered by the A380 will undoubtedly improve our competitiveness on international routes and it is the perfect asset to help China Southern Airlines achieve its goal of becoming a leading global carrier,"" Si said.

China Southern said in September that it will launch three new international routes this year, signaling its global ambitions.

Tom Enders, president and CEO of Airbus SAS, said China Southern, which currently operates almost 200 Airbus aircraft, is his company's biggest customer in Asia.

""With the A380, China Southern will surely play a key role in the top league of the world's leading airlines,"" said Enders.

He said the operation of A380s during the past four years has proved that the aircraft can help carriers gain more market share and maintain an advantage among stiff competition.

Singapore Airlines Ltd, the launch customer of the A380, said earlier that the number of passengers on its Singapore to Tokyo flight has increased by 7 percent since it started to use the aircraft on the route in May 2008. The airline started flying the A380 to Los Angeles in July

By September, Airbus had received 238 orders for A380s from 18 carriers and 57 of the aircraft fly 41 routes between 25 destinations worldwide. The plane has already carried more than 15 million passengers.

The list price of the A380 jumped to $375.3 million in January from the previous figure of $295 million.

An A380 can generate a profit as long as approximately 65 percent of its seats are occupied, which is lower than the industry's average load factor, said Richard Carcaillet, director of product marketing for the A380.

Statistics from the International Air Transport Association show that the average load factor across the industry was 78.4 percent in 2010.

However, analysts said it is unlikely that China Southern will generate a profit from the aircraft over the short term.

It is more difficult for A380 to make a profit, because the load factor is too high, said Li Lei, an aviation analyst with CITICS China Securities.

""It will be decided by which route the A380 is used on,"" said Li.

Although the breakeven point is 65 percent, China Southern still needs about 300 passengers to fill its new aircraft on each flight, he said. Only a few domestic destinations can satisfy that requirement.

""For China Southern, it is something of a gamble to purchase the A380,"" said Li."

Aircraft programme will support over 6,000 jobs across the UK

Aerial view of Airbus’ brand new 46,000 m2 A350 XWB wing factory, Broughton, Wales-UK (13 October 2011).

The British Prime Minister, the Rt Hon David Cameron, officially opened Airbus’ new £400 million wing factory in Wales this afternoon, a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility which will assemble the wings for Airbus’ advanced new A350 XWB long-range aircraft family.The Prime Minister joined hundreds of guests and Airbus employees to unveil the giant, environmentally friendly Airbus North Factory at Broughton, Flintshire where 650 people will eventually work. Bigger than Wembley Stadium, it is one of the largest manufacturing facilities to be built in the UK in recent years and will produce high-tech carbon fibre ‘composite’ wings for the A350 XWB.The A350 XWB programme will support over 1,200 jobs in the Airbus sites at Filton and Broughton and over 5,000 other high skill/high value jobs across the UK supply chain. Over £3 billion has been invested in the aircraft and its engines by UK aerospace companies in the programme which underpins the key position of the UK as a global centre of aerospace manufacture.Prime Minister David Cameron said: “The Government is committed to building a more balanced economy with stronger manufacturing, exports and private investment, creating jobs and opportunities across the UK. I welcome the opening of Airbus's new state of the art facility which will contribute to this and support our programme to create sustainable economic growth. Airbus's investment here also underlines its confidence in the expertise of its British workforce and in the UK's manufacturing base.”Secretary of State for Wales Cheryl Gillan said:"" This magnificent facility is a key part of the A350 XWB programme which will help sustain and support thousands of jobs across the UK. I have been a frequent visitor to Airbus and am confident this will further cement Wales' growing reputation as a first class innovator and leader in the Aerospace and supply chain sector. The new A350 XWB facility is great news for the North Wales economy and a tangible example of the kind of private sector growth the Government is working to create.""First Minister of Wales Carwyn Jones added: “The opening of this world class facility is a major achievement and excellent news for Wales. The Welsh Government and Airbus are delighted to be able to celebrate such a significant event which underlines a major investment in Broughton and reinforces our reputation as a country with high end manufacturing skills and high value products”.“The Airbus North Factory, a truly world-leading aircraft wing assembly plant, is a major pillar in the Airbus global setup. The opening today marks an important milestone for our A350 programme as we move towards the start of the aircraft final assembly”, said Airbus Chief Executive, Tom Enders. “This new facility and all the teams working on building our A350’s carbon-fibre wings will play a vital role in delivering this new generation aircraft.”The North Factory assembly line is dedicated to assembling the 31 metre long wings for all members of the A350 XWB Family which is scheduled to enter service by the end of 2013. Currently employing 6,000 people, the 700 acre Airbus site at Broughton specialises in wing production and has a proud tradition of aerospace manufacture going back over 70 years. Over £1.8 billion has been invested into the site in the past decade ensuring it is one of the most modern manufacturing facilities of its type anywhere in the world.· The pioneering Airbus North Factory covers a total area of over 46,000 square metres.· 58,000 metres of cable have been installed, this would reach from Broughton to Manchester· 8,000 tonnes of steelwork were used to build the factory· 250,000 bolts hold the building together· Optimised for energy savings, the factory’s power comes in part from three large solar tracking arrays and a wood pellet biomass power plant boiler.Airbus in the UK and its supply chain provide supplies and services worth nearly £1.5 billion annually to the UK economy. 10,000 people work for Airbus in the UK with 100,000 UK jobs supported through its wider supply chain.Airbus is the leading aircraft manufacturer offering the most modern, comprehensive and efficient passenger aircraft family on the more than 100-seat market, while its military division is the global leader for transport, tanker and surveillance airlifters ranging from three to 45 tonnes of payload. Airbus in the UK is world-renowned for its centres of excellence for both wing design and manufacture."
Plane fire caused by Airbus windscreen heater - Yahoo Singapore News,"Fri, 07 Oct 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vcGxhbmUtZmlyZS1jYXVzZWQtYWlyYnVzLXdpbmRzY3JlZW4taGVhdGVyLTA5NTcyNjIxMC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A fire that forced an Australian Airbus jet to make an emergency landing was sparked by a windscreen heating system, air accident investigators said Friday. The revelation of the cause of the blaze that erupted in the cockpit of an A330 jet, leading to an unscheduled landing on the Pacific island of Guam in June 2009, could force European operators to change the faulty windshields. The Jetstar airliner, carrying around 200 people, was en route from Osaka in Japan to Australia's Gold Coast when the fire broke out at the base of a windshield on the flight deck. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) said the fire, which was extinguished by crew as the aircraft was diverted to Guam, was caused by a sealant that overheated when the windshield heater was turned on. ""This had developed into the thermal breakdown of the sealant and the initiation of a localised fire,"" the ATSB said in a statement. After similar incidents occurred on other A330 and A320 jets, Airbus last year recommended carriers identify and replace 1,500 windshields worldwide that had been produced using the same sealant. But as not all operators have implemented the replacement, European air safety officials are considering making the change mandatory, the Australian agency said. ""The European Aviation Safety Authority is considering the implementation of an airworthiness directive that will require all European operators of applicable Airbus aircraft to comply with the Airbus windshield replacement program,"" the ATSB said. The Australian agency said however that national carrier Qantas, which owns discount carrier Jetstar, had completed the windscreen change on all affected planes."

Many will support Jetstar Airways, a low-cost airline owned by Qantas.

The deal is estimated to be worth around $9.5 billion, marking the largest single order in Australian aviation history by aircraft units with the firm order for 78 A320neo and 32 A320s. The deal is part of Qantas’ fleet renewal and expansion plans in the coming years and also follows a commitment signed in August.

The A320neo is a new engine option for the A320 Family to enter service in 2015. According to Airbus, it incorporates the latest generation engines and large “Sharklet” wing tip devices, which has shown to deliver 15 percent in fuel and CO2 emission savings.

The new aircraft will be deployed across the Qantas Group on short to medium haul domestic and international operations and underpins, according to Airbus, the airline’s commitment to build a fleet with ‘the most fuel efficient and reliable aircraft’ in the market.

“The Airbus A320 will be the launch aircraft for Qantas’ new, premium airline based in Asia and will support Jetstar’s expansion plans – including the establishment of Jetstar Japan,” said Alan Joyce, Qantas CEO. “The A320 Family’s outstanding operational efficiency and comfort, plus its environmental credentials, make it the right choice for the Qantas Group.”

Airbus launched the A320neo ten months ago, in December 2010, and has already received 1,245 orders and commitments."
The most powerful companies you've never heard of: EADS - The Conversation Indonesia,"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS90aGUtbW9zdC1wb3dlcmZ1bC1jb21wYW5pZXMteW91dmUtbmV2ZXItaGVhcmQtb2YtZWFkcy0zMTky0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Welcome to “The most powerful companies you’ve never heard of” – an ongoing series from The Conversation that sheds light on big companies with low profiles. Today, Monash University’s Remy Davison examines European aircraft and weapons manufacturer EADS.

You may have never heard of the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), but it is likely that you have travelled on an aircraft manufactured by its high-profile subsidiary, Airbus.

The Airbus A320 shuttles thousands of passengers daily on short-haul flights throughout Australia and around the world.

Qantas took its first deliveries of the Airbus A380 in late 2008, with its superjumbo fleet now totalling 10 aircraft. The planes have cost the airline about $350 million each.

But civil aviation isn’t EADS’s only business.

The company, headquartered in the Dutch city of Leiden, is listed simultaneously on six European stock exchanges, including the London, Paris, Frankfurt and Madrid bourses.

EADS is also seriously cashed-up: as of last month, it had $US16 billion in cash.

AAP

It is also perhaps the only truly transnational, integrated firm in the European Union. It draws its engineering talent and management from throughout Europe, and employs well over 100,000 workers.

Less well known are EADS’s other major products: weapons.

With almost $US16 billion in sales in 2009, it is one of the world’s largest armaments manufacturers. Its Dornier aircraft and Euromissile subsidiaries account for a considerable proportion of its anual revenue of $US50 billion.

A merger deal in 2003 saw Euromissile come under the control of trans-European weapons manufacturer MBDA, which used to be known as Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm. Yes, that’s the same Messerschmitt that lit up London’s skies during the Blitz.

Among other things, MBDA builds guided missile systems and state-of-the-art anti-tank missiles.

MBDA is 37.5% owned by EADS, with BAe Systems – better-known as British Aerospace – taking another 37.5%.

Italy’s partly state-owned Finmeccanica, a major aerospace and defence conglomerate, controls the remaining 25%.

Ownership obscured

Who controls EADS? Well, it’s complicated.

Most of EADS’s stock is not publicly listed on financial markets. Instead there is a “gentlemen’s agreement” that sees the company rest firmly under the control of two Franco-German conglomerates.

SOGEADE, a holding company that is majority-controlled by the French government and media firm Lagardère, has 22.5% of EADS, while German giant Daimler holds 22.5%.

That’s right – Daimler. Better known for its Mercedes-Benz cars, Daimler has been in the aerospace business for decades. But in August this year, Daimler indicated it was seeking to divest itself of EADS shares, with German private investors likely to have first refusal.

EADS’s piece de resistance is the Spanish-assembled Airbus A400M, a long-haul military transporter designed to eliminate the EU’s dependence upon US-owned Boeing C-17s and rented Ukrainian Antonovs.

The A400M’s principal customers are the French, German and British governments, although smaller orders have been received from other countries.

astirn

But while the A400M is EADS’s military flagship, it has also proved its bugbear.

In 2005, 17 EADS executives from Daimler and Lagardère, together with then-CEO Thomas Enders, cashed out their considerable stock holdings. They reaped significant gains from EADS’s share price, which was fattened largely on the basis of prospective A400M orders and the announcement of the A380 superjumbo.

But shortly afterwards, the A400M – no more than a cardboard model in 2005 – faced delay after frustrating delay. From 192 “firm” orders in 2007, 400M confirmed sales plummeted to 174.

Germany cut its order from 73 to 53, while France plans to take 50. More more than 50% of orders rely upon Berlin and Paris. South Africa cancelled its eight-aircraft order, while Airbus lost out to Boeing in Canada. Chile, which showed early interest, has gone for Brazilian aircraft instead.

Following the stock sales, it was revealed that the A380 was the victim of significant engineering problems, of which EADS shareholders were unaware in 2005. Further A380 delivery delays were announced in 2006, causing a stock collapse of over 25% in 24 hours.

Few Europeans would ever have heard of EADS until before this affair. But the executives’ stock sales in 2005 elicited widespread condemnation from shareholders and media accusations of millions of dollars in unlawful gains, triggering a 2009 investigation of alleged insider dealing.

AAP

Although the regulator called for substantial fines of the executives, all were cleared by a subsequent French inquiry.

Into space

Perhaps the most controversial EADS project is its space subsidiary’s involvement in the EU’s GPS program, Galileo.

China has invested €230 million in Galileo, which is a 30-satellite program. This means that China could acquire satellite guidance systems for air-to-ground ordnance for a mere $US18,000 a piece, making the country entirely independent of the United States’ satellite system.

The loophole that makes Galileo’s infrastructure available to China relates to the notion that, under EU rules, satellite systems are “dual use” – for civilian and military purposes. This is despite a longstanding EU embargo on arms and military-related exports to China, in place since 1989.

Given that China is also developing laser systems capable of destroying satellites, this could not only render US guidance systems inoperable, but mean that China would retain its own use of Galileo, making it entirely autonomous of the US GPS system.

Let us not forget that nuclear and conventional missiles are GPS-guided.

Quite publicly, American officials have stated that in the event of armed conflict with China, US forces would have no other option but to destroy Galileo entirely.

If China blew the US GPS out of the sky, the US would have no satellite capability, while China would still have Galileo. The EU may protest Galileo is a civilian system, but the Pentagon clearly views its military deployment capabilities as a threat to US national security.

The battle for aerospace

Back in 1987, the EU initiated the ambitious European Single Market program, of which the euro is a concomitant part.

By 2002, both the euro and the Single Market were firmly established. But what Europe lacked was an integrated single market in defence procurement, with British, German, French, Italian and Spanish firms engaging in product duplication. Economies of scale were non-existent.

In 1999, the EU promulgated the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), a thinly-veiled rival to NATO. But ESDP relied – and still does, largely – upon NATO military assets.

And although the EU has the world’s second-largest defence budget, it imports 40% of its defence materiel from the US.

AAP

To realise efficiencies in defence procurement, Brussels created the European Defence Agency (EDA), an office designed to encourage mergers, acquisitions and joint R&D defence projects.

By far the biggest beneficiary of an integrated EU armaments market has been EADS. Without ESDP, neither the Airbus A400M nor the Eurofighter Typhoon would have come to fruition (the latter spent most of the 1990s in limbo as EU governments fought over its funding).

The bottom line is that the EU would have lost both the civil and military aviation war to the US had it not sought to beat Boeing through industrial integration and subsidies.

EADS became the trans-European conglomerate that made EU aerospace viable and competitive in global markets, albeit via significant government intervention and massive defence contracts.

Abortive attempts by President Chirac and former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to remove the EU arms embargo on China in 2005 also angered Pentagon officials, who view the EU’s relations with Beijing as too cosy by half.

And, as EADS branches out into more controversial joint projects with China, such as Galileo, EU-US defence relations are likely to remain mired in a mutuality of suspicion.

Bearing up: Airbus Military's 'Grizzly' nears civil certification - Flightglobal,"Thu, 27 Oct 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYmVhcmluZy11cC1haXJidXMtbWlsaXRhcnlzLWdyaXp6bHktbmVhcnMtY2l2aWwtY2VydGlmaWNhdGlvbi8xMDI3NDcuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Flight test activities with the Airbus Military A400M ­transport remain on track for completion by the end of 2012, with fixes having recently been agreed to ­resolve two separate ­engine issues which affected the programme earlier this year.

Updating the progress made using four ""Grizzly"" development aircraft for the first time since the type's restricted appearance at the Paris air show in June, Airbus head of flight operations Fernando Alonso said the fleet had logged 784 flights and 2,380 flight hours by 20 October.

Recent highlights included ­clearing water ingestion testing, making take-offs and landings under high crosswind conditions and performing the first low-level flights, down to 330ft (91m) at 280kt (518km/h).

Water ingestion testing proved that the highest wake experienced - at about 80kt - would not reach the aircraft's Europrop ­International (EPI) TP400-D6 engines. However, a minor design tweak will be required, as a link on the main landing gear door structure broke after water forced its way through a gap between the structure and a rub pad.

© Airbus Military

The European airframer's chief test pilot military Ed Strongman said the A400M's crosswind handling has been demonstrated to 25kt, ­gusting to 37kt on take-off and 26kt and 34kt respectively on landing. ""The engines behaved immaculately,"" he added.

Such tests are being performed as Airbus Military works to complete the tasks required before securing civil type certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency - a target which it had previously set for completion ­before the end of this year.

""We are advancing very quickly towards the end of [civil] certification testing,"" Alonso said at the company's flight test centre in Toulouse, France. ""I cannot say if we will finish on 10 December or 10 January [2012]. We will finish as soon as we can.""

But the A400M's overall ­schedule - to complete 3,700h of core flight testing before deliveries can commence - has been threatened by several issues. The first arose in late 2010, when artificial ice shapes installed on the wing leading edges of aircraft MSN1 caused a large amount of buffeting as disturbed air hit the horizontal tail. This required a ­refinement of the sections of the composite wing which would need anti-icing equipment installed to take bleed air from the engines. Alonso said the work took about six weeks to complete, and was ""really penalising on the programme.""

The new configuration will be installed on MSN2 early next year, followed by all production aircraft. MSN1 has been held ready since August to complete the four more flights needed under natural icing conditions.

Engine supplier EPI has also resolved two engine issues, one of which was behind the decision to limit the A400M to making just one brief public ­flying ­appearance at Le Bourget.

EPI president Simon Henley revealed that the uncommanded in-flight shutdown of one of MSN1's engines on 6 June was traced to a fatigue crack in the tooth fillet radius on an idler gear, and caused by a resonance issue. A new software algorithm will alert the crew if an engine approaches the same conditions in flight again, and an upgraded idler gear design will be installed from November.

A high-pressure compressor blade fatigue fault also required three test engines to be removed from A400Ms earlier this year. The problem occurred at ground idle due to wake separation from the engine's variable inlet guide vane. A software patch will prevent a repeat occurrence, and an upgraded inlet vane design will be used on production aircraft.

EPI is to launch series production of the TP400 late this year, and deliver the engines for the programme's first customer aircraft in early 2012. A crucial enabler for handing this A400M over late next year will be the availability of a fifth and last Grizzly. MSN6 had been expected to fly recently with a production-standard cargo hold, but Alonso ­confirmed Airbus Military is ­assessing whether to delay this until early 2012. ""Our priority is to get it in a configuration for ­testing,"" he added.

The aircraft will perform key military tests, including equipment loading, cold weather operations in Sweden and high-altitude testing in La Paz, Bolivia, before completing 300h of ­""functioning and reliability"" testing. Other work to be performed using the development fleet next year should include grass landings in Germany, gravity load drops and receiving fuel in flight for the first time.

Alonso is confident that the A400M will meet its service entry goal. ""We are delighted with how the aircraft is performing,"" he said. ""We have removed most, if not all of the risk.""

Airbus delivers A380 to China Southern - China.org,"Sat, 15 Oct 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHA6Ly93d3cuY2hpbmEub3JnLmNuL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMTEtMTAvMTUvY29udGVudF8yMzYzMTkxMS5odG3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The first Airbus A380 delivered to China Southern Airlines is parked in front of the Airbus Delivery Center during a ceremony in Colomiers near Toulouse October 14, 2011.

China Southern Airlines Co Ltd became the first Chinese operator of the Airbus A380 as Airbus delivered the superjumbo to the Chinese carrier at a handover ceremony on Friday at the Airbus Delivery Center in Toulouse.

The aircraft was the first out of five A380 ordered by China Southern in 2005 and scheduled to be delivered before 2013.

China Souther Airlines will begin operating the aircraft on domestic routes between Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai from October 17 and launch international fights in December when a second aircraft is delievered.

The China Southern A380 is powered by Rolls-Royce Trend-900 engines and feature a 506-seat cabin, including 8 luxury first-class suites, 70 flat-bed business-class seats and 428 economy-class seats.

The ticket price will be the same as other aircraft flying on routes. The price of an economy class seat between Beijing and Guangzhou is 1,700 yuan (US$266).

""The economics offered by the A380 will undoubtedly improve our competitiveness on international routes and it is the perfect asset to help China Southern Airlines achieve its goal of becoming a leading global carrier,"" Si said.

Since entering service in 2007, the eco-friendly A380 has transported some 16 million passengers to date, according to Airbus.

The superjumbo's spacious cabin provides carriers higher-than-average capacity and increased profitability. Typically seating 525 passengers in a three-class layout, the A380 is capable of flying 8,300 nautical miles or 15,300km per flight."

[Xinhua]



An Airbus A380 jet touched down at Guangzhou Baiyun Airport on Monday, marking the superjumbo jet's first commercial flight in China.

Departing Beijing for the southern city of Guangzhou at 10:00 a.m., the fully-loaded flight landed around 1:00 p.m. with more than 500 passengers aboard, including Chinese basketball player Yao Ming and mayor of Guangzhou Wan Qingliang.

""Flying on board the first A380 in our country is really different. I felt exceptionally comfortable, while the space available on other jets is quite narrow for me,"" said Yao who used to play with the U.S. Houston Rockets.

Many passengers snapped pictures of the plane, with some saying that they booked tickets well in advance because they were eager to fly on a new jet.

""I am so excited. My camera never left my hand,"" said passenger Zhou Xiaofei.

""The performance of the A380 is extraordinary. I felt more comfortable when piloting the plane,"" said Liu Xian, vice general manager with the China Southern Airlines, the operator of the superjumbo.

The A380 jumbo is scheduled to fly between Beijing and Guangzhou until Oct. 26 and then travel between Beijing and Shanghai from Oct. 27 to 29. And then it will be used on an international route afterwards.

China's domestic air travel market is predicted to grow 13.9 percent annually by 2014 and transport 379 million domestic air travel passengers, which will make the country the world's second-largest air travel market after the United States, according to a report released by the International Air Transport Association.

The purchase of an A380 jet is part of China's efforts to accommodate surging air travel demands unleashed by the country's economic boom.

Li Jiaxiang, chief of China's civil aviation administration, estimated that over 1.5 trillion yuan (235 billion U.S. dollars) will be invested in the civil aviation industry by 2015, adding about 2,000 aircraft to the country's fleet.

But industry insiders said China's civil aviation needs to improve while expanding. Civilian flights have long been plagued by constant delays, which the administration attributed to crowded air space as well as poor coordination between airlines and airports.

Airport management may also curb the growth of civil aviation. China plans to build 45 new airports by 2015, although more than 75 percent of its current 175 airports suffered from deficits in 2010, according to the administration."

Mr Si stated the ""outcome of the negotiations between China and the EU on emissions will not be a key factor for us to consider where to fly our A380s."" But he added: ""I should say that the EU's decision on emissions would to a large extent affect an airline's operating costs and at the end of the day the interests of our passengers.""

""Before we decide whether we are going to acquire more Airbus or Boeing planes we have to take the market situation into consideration and make a very careful analysis of the markets because China Southern has such a big aircraft fleet,"" Mr Si continued.

China as a country has threatened to acquire fewer aircraft from Airbus as a result of its dispute with the EU over the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) scheme. In Jun-2011, the Chinese Government reportedly blocked an order from Hainan Airlines' subsidiary Hong Kong Airlines for 10 A380s, a move believed to express the government's disapproval of Chinese carriers' inclusion in the EU ETS from 2012.

Airbus expects more A380 sales in China

Chairman Si's comments on evaluating the A380's performance before deciding to potentially order more is consistent with Airbus' outlook on future A380 sales in China. Airbus has previously stated it expects to sell more A380 aircraft in China in the coming years, aided by strong air travel demand in the fast-growing market. While China Southern Airlines is the sole Chinese airline to have ordered the aircraft, Airbus CEO and president Tom Enders has stated it expects the nation's other major carriers to warm to the aircraft soon.

""We're pretty confident in the coming years we'll sell more A380s in China. We certainly don't have to wait 10 years"" for demand for A380s to pick up in China, Airbus China president Laurence Barron said earlier this year. ""Chinese airlines historically have not been very enthusiastic about buying a product early in the programme. It will take some time for the Chinese airlines to really understand what a great aircraft it is,"" Mr Barron said of the A380.

Since entering scheduled service in Oct-2007, A380s flown by six different carriers have transported more than 13 million passengers, performing over 35,000 revenue flights while accumulating approximately 315,000 revenue flight hours. ""Four years of operation show that airlines who fly the A380 increase capacity, gain market share and improve load factors - with an A380 now taking off or landing every 15 minutes,"" Mr Enders said at the delivery ceremony of the China Southern Airlines' A380. The other carriers with A380s currently in their fleets are Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Qantas, Air France, Lufthansa and Korean Air. These aircraft are meeting their performance specifications while serving 25 major cities worldwide, including flights that link the Middle East and Europe to Beijing and Shanghai in China.

A380 improves competitiveness as China Southern looks to tackle rail competition

Taking delivery of the new aircraft, China Southern chairman Si Xianmin stated: ""We are proud to become the first A380 operator in China. The introduction of the A380 in our fleet is a very important step for the development of China Southern. The economics offered by the A380 will undoubtedly improve our competitiveness on international routes and is the perfect asset to make China Southern Airlines achieve its goal of becoming a leading global carrier"".

China Southern Airlines' A380

China Southern Airlines head of planning Yang Bo previously stated the carrier's A380s, and other aircraft, would help the airline more than double the percentage of capacity deployed on overseas routes to 35% by 2015. In an interview with Bloomberg he said the A380 will ""put us in a completely different league"" and help the carrier boost its brand image and raise its international profile. China Southern Airlines president Tan Wangeng had similar sentiments: ""We will improve our services, boost our brand image and accelerate internationalisation with the A380.""

China Southern Airlines is seeking to add more widebody aircraft to its fleet as it boots its international network amid intensifying competition on domestic routes following the development of the high-speed rail network in China. Like its 'Big Three' peers, China Southern Airlines' network remains heavily oriented to the domestic market. It has the lowest level of international traffic (RPKs) of its peer group, but the fastest growth rate in the past four months. China Southern is in the unenviable position of having 80% of its domestic route network, and nearly a quarter of its city pairs, competing with high-speed rail.

The carrier is scheduled to receive its second A380 in Dec-2011, a third in Feb-2012, its fourth in 2H2012 and its fifth and final A380 in 2013. While China Southern's order for five A380s is in line with some smaller operators like Malaysia Airlines and Thai Airways, the higher growth from China and large order book of wide-body aircraft from competitors could easily see China Southern order additional A380s. Airbus projects the A380 to have the range to operate to almost any destination from China, with the exception of South America.

The carrier's eight first-class suites on the A380 are located on the lower deck of the aircraft, in the front of the main cabin. These suites will have lie-flat massage seats. The 428 economy class seats are located in the lower deck as well. The upper deck of each of the aircraft will form the business class with 70 full-flat seats. This configuration means the carrier will configure the aircraft with the one of the highest amount of economy class seats among A380 operators.

Currently only Air France has A380s in service with a higher number of economy class seats (449), but with the existing models to be retrofitted shortly to include premium economy (reducing economy class seat count to 389), China Southern will have the largest the number of economy class seats although Emirates will be behind by one seat. Thai Airways and later Air Austral will usurp the title of largest number of economy class seats - although the distinction means their premium demand is lower than other operators.

Airline Livery of the Week: China Eastern Airlines “Expo 2010” on an A340-600 - Airline Reporter,"Sat, 01 Oct 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMS8xMC9haXJsaW5lLWxpdmVyeS1vZi10aGUtd2Vlay1jaGluYS1lYXN0ZXJuLWFpcmxpbmVzLWV4cG8tMjAxMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A340-600 is one long plane. With a length of over 246 feet, it is the second longest airliner produced behind the new Boeing 747-8. This gives a lot of room for airlines to show off special liveries and that is just want China Eastern Airlines did for their special Expo 2010 livery.

Sure, the Expo 2010 happened in Shanghai China from May 1st to the end of October 2010, but that does not mean the airline has to remove the icon off their website, or replace the livery. (Even though it is possible they have, the most recent photo I could find is from July 2011).

So does this livery work? In my opinion it is a bit ugly. Maybe if the airline did not try to keep their normal livery and the new design, it would have worked a lot better, but this just seems to be trying too hard with too many colors going all over the place. Although, from the front, is it not too bad.

China Eastern Airlines is based in Shanghai and has been in operation since 1988. It currently flies to over 100 international and domestic destinations and is a member of the SkyTeam alliance. The airline operates a mixed fleet of more than 265 aircraft from the smaller Bombardier CRJ200 to the A340-600, which is the largest aircraft in their fleet.

180 aircraft needed for South African airlines over next 20 years - Airbus - defenceWeb,"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbmNld2ViLmNvLnphL2Flcm9zcGFjZS9hZXJvc3BhY2UtYWVyb3NwYWNlLzE4MC1haXJjcmFmdC1uZWVkZWQtZm9yLXNvdXRoLWFmcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtb3Zlci1uZXh0LTIwLXllYXJzLWFpcmJ1cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"South African airlines will require 183 aircraft worth US$29 billion over the next twenty years, Airbus has predicted in its latest Global Market Forecast, while African airlines will require 1 101 new passenger aircraft worth US$126 billion.

At a presentation in Johannesburg today, Airbus Director Strategic Marketing & Analysis Andrew Gordon said that the requirement until 2030 for all aircraft (with more than 30 seats and including all manufacturers) in South Africa comprises 90 single aisle aircraft, 80 twin aisle aircraft, and 13 very large aircraft.

Overall, Africa’s passenger aircraft requirement includes 790 single aisle aircraft, 273 twin aisle aircraft, and 38 very large aircraft. In addition, African airlines are expected to take delivery of 325 second hand aircraft by 2030.

Airbus forecasts average annual passenger growth rates to, from and within South Africa of 6% over the next 20 years. This surpasses the all-Africa 5.7% average growth rate, and is well above the 4.8% world average growth rate.

“Aviation is essential for the development of the region, with African traffic flows representing four of the top ten fastest growing flows worldwide. People really do want and need to fly in Africa,” Gordon, said. “South Africa has experienced a 45% percent growth in air traffic since 2000. Increased tourism, business relationships with developing nations, more domestic and inter-regional flying and further opportunities for low cost airlines are all drivers for growth.”

Airbus predicts that passenger traffic through Johannesburg will continue to rise, especially on routes to other mega cities. Airbus expects more flights will be operated by very large aircraft such as the A380 to make best use of limited airport capacity, and to efficiently move the large numbers of people who want to travel to the region. Air France, Lufthansa and Emirates currently operate the A380 on high density routes to and from Johannesburg.

At the moment, 180 Airbus aircraft are flying with 32 customers and operators in the Africa and Indian Ocean region, while 20 customers have placed 245 orders.

Gordon noted that emerging economies are growing faster than other economies, and that growing GDP results in increasing passenger numbers. Other factors driving demand for new aircraft include population growth with increasing wealth, greater urbanization and a more than doubling in the number of mega cities by 2030, the ongoing expansion of low cost carriers, and the need to replace older less efficient aircraft.

At the moment, Boeing has a 66% market share, with 371 aircraft in service, while Airbus has a 26% market share with 146 aircraft in service, but Airbus has more aircraft to be delivered (83 versus 75 for Boeing). Most recently, Air Namibia is taking delivery of two A319s and two A320s while Nigerian carrier First Nation received three A320s from ACG. CAA Congo added two more A320s and Cabo Verde Airlines recently signed a lease for one A320.

Airbus last month in its Global Market Forecast that by 2030 some 27,800 new aircraft will be required by airlines around the world. The combined value of the over 26,900 passenger aircraft (above 100 seats) and more than 900 new factory built freighters forecast by the GMF is US$3.5 trillion. At the end of September, Airbus had sold 11 098 aircraft and delivered 6 882.

Earlier this month Boeing predicted that African airlines will require 800 new airliners between now and 2030, 12% more than last year’s forecast. According to Van Rex Gallard, Boeing’s Vice President of sales: Latin America, Africa and the Caribbean, of the 800 new airliners 6% will be regional aircraft, 64% will be single aisle airliners, 29% will be widebodies and 1% will be widebodies. 34% of the 800 new aircraft will replace old aircraft while 56% will take care of growth.

By 2030 the global passenger fleet will more than double from today’s 15 000 aircraft to 31 500, Airbus said. This will include some 27 800 new aircraft deliveries of which 10 500 will be needed for replacing older less fuel efficient aircraft. The trend towards larger aircraft will continue, in order for the aviation sector to keep pace with future growth in demand. – Airbus notes that the average size of aircraft is increasing.

Airbus forecasts that Revenue Passenger Kilometres (RPKs) will grow by an average 4.8 per cent per year, which is equivalent to traffic more than doubling in the next 20 years. The great demand for new commercial aircraft is benefiting South African industry through their work with Airbus. Omnipless provides the satellite communication system for all Airbus commercial aircraft, while Aerosud produces aerostructures for the A350 XWB and the A320 family of aircraft (A318, A319, A320 and A321)."

The order, comprising 32 A320s and 78 A320neos was signed by Qantas CEO Alan Joyce and Airbus COO Customers John Leahy on October 6.

Of the 110 aircraft, 11 have been allocated to the new Qantas premium airline which will be established in Kuala Lumpur or Singapore – possibly the first time the A320 will be seen in Qantas mainline colours – while the other 99 will go to Jetstar to accommodate growth and to replace aircraft coming off lease.

“The reasons we’ve chosen the NEO, is the economic advantage and the impact on costs that are driven by fuel, maintenance and safety, and aircraft being delivered this decade,” Buchanan told media on October 6. “Simplicity of transformation into the NEO which is a largely common aircraft to our existing fleet makes the decision relatively easy. In terms of routing, the good thing about the NEO is that it can do anything the A320 can do today, and extends that range with both the sharklets and the engines. That will allow routes like Melbourne or Sydney to Bali and routes like Singapore to Beijing or Shanghai to be operated by narrow bodies, and also extends the range of the operation to make routes like Singapore or Kuala Lumpur to the Australian east coast a reality as well.”

“Of the 99 (for Jetstar), there’s a series of aircraft that are slated for Japan, and a small number of aircraft that are slated for growth aircraft in our existing business,” he added. “And then there’s a series of aircraft that are slated at the moment for the rollover of existing aircraft, but we do have the flexibility of being able to use those for growth or for rollover coverage.”

While the orders have been booked for A320s, Buchanan added that there is scope to convert some of these to A321s, and that the airline was conducting a study into the use of the larger capacity aircraft on pan-Asian routes.

Interestingly, Buchanan confirmed that the order had been placed after consultations with Air Asia. The two airlines announced in 2009 that they would team up in specifying a new narrow body airliner, and he and Airbus’s John Leahy confirmed that the NEO was designed in part as a response to the two airlines’ requirements.

Qantas is yet to make an engine decision for its NEOs. The CFM LEAP-X and the P&W PurePower PW1100G are both on offer for the new variant."
"Next-gen Airbus A380 to fly further, longer - Executive Traveller","Fri, 07 Oct 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vbmV4dC1nZW4tYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtdG8tZmx5LWZ1cnRoZXItbG9uZ2Vy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Imagine stepping onto a Qantas flight in Sydney or Melbourne and going straight through to New York or London.

At around 20 hours non-stop it’d be the longest of the world’s long haul routes – and according to Airbus, such flights are “the holy grail we’re always chasing”.

Airbus executive vice president Tom Williams cites Singapore Airlines’ non-stop flights from Singapore to New York and Los Angeles — taking around 18 hours to ply the 15,000km trek on an ultralong-range version Airbus A340 — as examples of what can already be done today, and says “we continue to work on improving range.”

But, as he tells Australian Business Traveller, “it all comes back to economics.”

“Singapore Airlines do those flights with an all business class cabin” he explains, and airlines also need to carry enough freight down below. ""A lot of the airline business model today is driven not only by passengers but what’s in the belly of the aircraft. They’ll typically say we need to find 20 tonnes of useful freight in order for that mission to make good economic sense.”

That said, Airbus sees an evolution of the A380 as helping to unlock the payload puzzle.

“We’re working on things like weight improvements and trying to squeeze more power out of the engine” Williams says of the second-gen superjumbo, which will add an extra 190km in range – in theory, enough to make a direct Sydney-New York flight possible.

The enhanced A380 will debut in 2013, with British Airways and Emirates as first customers, with Qantas to follow later in the decade.

This range map from Sydney shows the maximum range for the Boeing 747-400ER (lightest grey), the current Airbus A380 (medium grey), and the upgraded A380 (dark grey), not taking headwinds into account.

Williams quotes the same rule of economics when it comes to the A380-900, a stretched version of the today’s standard A380-800, which remains on the drawing board at Airbus HQ.

“I lead the team that designed the wings of the A380, and (when she first saw the models) even my good lady wife was quick to point out that the wings are very big in comparison to the fuselage” he recalls.

“The wings are in fact designed for a much larger airplane, so we have the capability of going to a bigger fuselage – we can stretch the fuselage very easily.”

“And we have airlines today who tell us they love the A380 but it’s too small! Now it’s not an engineering issue, we can make it bigger, it’s more a question of what would be a good business case and where the market for this is. I don’t want to develop that airplane for a niche, if we’re only going to sell 20 airplanes to only two customers it’s not worth doing."""
"Airbus, Qantas seal Australia's biggest airline order - SKNVibes.com","Thu, 06 Oct 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMGh0dHA6Ly9tLnNrbnZpYmVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ld3NkZXRhaWxzLmNmbS80NDgxONIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Sydney, AUS) - European aircraft giant Airbus Thursday finalised a deal worth US$9.5 billion with Australia's Qantas for 110 A320 jets to expand into Asia, calling it the nation's single largest airplane order.

John Leahy, Airbus chief operating officer for customers, said Qantas had officially signed off on the order, which was flagged in August as part of the carrier's Asia-focused restructuring.

""The firm order for 78 A320neo and 32 A320s is the largest single order in Australian aviation history by aircraft units,"" Airbus said in a statement.

The next-generation A320neo burns 15 percent less fuel than the original A320 and is a key part of France-based Airbus's growth plans.

Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said the deal would underpin the airline's plans to launch two new Asian brands, including a low-cost tie-up with Japan Airlines and Mitsubishi Corp and a separate joint-venture premium airline.

""The Airbus A320 will be the launch aircraft for Qantas' new premium airline based in Asia and will support Jetstar's expansion plans -- including the establishment of Jetstar Japan,"" said Joyce."

Officials said that the airbus had first approached the Chennai airport but did not get clearance for landing as the runway was busy. The pilot then contacted Air Traffic Control at Shamshabad and got the clearance to land there.



Engineers from the aircraft’s headquarters in France have been sent to Hyderabad to attend to the technical snag. This is the second time that an A380 airbus has landed at Hyderabad.

Thousands of German Airbus workers on strike: union - SKNVibes.com,"Fri, 07 Oct 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHA6Ly93d3cuc2tudmliZXMuY29tL25ld3MvbmV3c2RldGFpbHMuY2ZtLzQ1MDky0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Berlin, DEU) - Some 11,000 employees of aircraft manufacturer Airbus downed tools Friday, the IG Metall union said, after bosses and workers failed to agree a new wage accord.

Negotiations broke down last month after a year and a half of efforts to reach a deal on a range of issues from an employment guarantee to a ceiling on the number of temporary workers that can be hired.

""Only together can we secure the future of Airbus,"" said Meinhard Geiken, a representative of IG Metall, as he called on management to return to the negotiating table.

A major sticking point in negotiations is over commitments to increase employee productivity.

Florian Seidel, an Airbus spokesman, told AFP that the number of people on strike was closer to 4,000 and called on unions to come back to the talks.

""What we are offering is a deal that is second to none,"" he said. ""We are ready to give employment guarantees for the next nine years and what we are asking for in return is a rise in productivity rates.""

He added that ""both sides are not that far apart"" and he expected a return to negotiations ""in the next few days.""

""That's the reason we didn't see the necessity of the strike,"" said Seidel.

The workers have offered productivity gains of two percent worth about one billion euros ($1.3 billion) between now and 2020 in exchange for guarantees of employment and maintaining four work sites in northern Germany.

Management wants a higher rate of eight percent, according to the unions."
Chinese C919 Passenger jet to take on Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 - PakWheels,"Mon, 03 Oct 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBha3doZWVscy5jb20vZm9ydW1zL3QvY2hpbmVzZS1jOTE5LXBhc3Nlbmdlci1qZXQtdG8tdGFrZS1vbi1ib2VpbmctNzM3LWFuZC1haXJidXMtYTMyMC8xODgxNDjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(posting this since there was no Comac C919 thread here.. close if repost)

China is taking on the world’s only large commercial aircraft producers Boeing and Airbus with its first homegrown passenger jet, the C919. The C919, built by state-owned enterprise Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), is a single-aisle commercial liner designed to compete with the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737. It was officially unveiled at the Zhuhai air show in south China on November 16, 2010.

Comac claims that they have already received orders for 100 jets from four Chinese domestic airlines Air China, China Southern, China Eastern and Hainan Airlines, as well as the U.S.-owned GE Capital Aviation Service.

The Chinese state media reports that the estimated market price for the C919 is 20 percent cheaper than its foreign competitors. The company expects to sell more than 2,000 C919s globally over the next 20 years.

The first ""9"" in the aircraft's model number stands for “forever,” based on two words’ similar pronunciations in Chinese. The “19” refers to the maximum number of 190 seats on the aircraft.

Design and assembly of the aircraft will be done in Shanghai, using foreign-made jet engines and avionics. Dimensions of the C919 are very similar to the Airbus A320. Its fuselage will be 3.96 meters (13 feet) wide, and 4.166 meters (13 feet, 8 inches) high, producing a cross-section of 12.915 square meters (139 square feet). The wingspan will be 33.6 meters (110 feet, 3 inches), or 35.4 meters (116 feet, 3 inches) if wiglets are included.<sup id=""cite_ref-AvWeek1_6-3"" class=""reference"">

</sup>According to a film shown by Comac at the 2010 Zhuhai Airshow, the company plans to build six different models of the aircraft: a base passenger aircraft with 168 seats, as well as stretched and shrunk passenger versions, business jet and freighter models, and a type designated only as ""special.""

Test flights for the C919 are set for 2014 and the planes will be delivered in 2016. Comac added that the C919 hopes to cash in on China’s domestic demand for planes. Some 4,439 commercial jets are expected to be needed in China by the year 2029, constituting 14 percent of the world's demand.

Airbus opens North Factory - Place North West,"Thu, 13 Oct 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBsYWNlbm9ydGh3ZXN0LmNvLnVrL2FpcmJ1cy1vcGVucy1ub3J0aC1mYWN0b3J5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A new 494,000 sq ft factory making carbon-fibre wings for the A350 airliner will be officially unveiled at a ceremony in Broughton, North Wales later today.

The new facility, called North Factory, will employ 650 staff. The A350 will have capacity for 340 passengers and id due to start flying in 2013.

The Flintshire plant is the UK's biggest manufacturing site, with 6,000 staff. Airbus said it has 550 orders for the A350. The lighter wings are expected to help the airliner generate 25% fuel efficiency savings compared to rivals. The last major investment in Broughton was the West Factory in 2003, producing wings for the Airbus A380 superjumbo.

The Welsh Government has put £29m into composite wing training and advanced manufacturing at Broughton.

Cllr Mike Jones, leader of Cheshire West & Chester Council, said: ""This is wonderful news for both the British aircraft industry and the North West region.

""Whilst I do not know exactly how many workers from West Cheshire depend on Airbus for their livelihood, the number could be as high as 2,000.

""Today's announcement will help to bring continued stability to the West Cheshire and North Wales areas and is particularly pleasing because these are manufacturing jobs – a priority for the sub-region."""

Air Pacific orders 3 new Airbus aircrafts

By fijivillage.com Tuesday 25/10/2011 fijivillage.com

Fiji’s international carrier, Air Pacific had made a historic announcement today as the airline has ordered three new Airbus A330-200 aircraft to replace its current fleet of B747 and B767 aircraft.



While making the announcement and signing the deal with Airbus in Suva today, Air Pacific Managing Director and CEO, Dave Pflieger said this is a significant milestone for the airline and the people of Fiji.







This sees Air Pacific moving away from the leased Boeing planes and entering into an agreement for the first time ever to purchase Airbus planes.



The first of the three state of the art planes will be arriving in March 2013 while the other two will arrive in Nadi later that year.



Pflieger said the catalogue price of a A330-200 plane is 200 million US dollars however he said due to confidential commercial agreements, he would not be able to reveal further details on the purchase price of the three planes.



The planes will have 20% additional cargo capacity and will also burn 45 percent less fuel than the current 747-400 jumbo jets.



This will result in significant fuel saving for Air Pacific and will also be more environmentally friendly.



Tourism Minister, Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum said this is a huge leap forward for Air Pacific and Fiji as a whole.







Dave Pflieger confirmed that Air Pacific has borrowed about $200 million for initial funding in relation to the purchase of the three aircrafts.







Sayed-Khaiyum said the FNPF loan to Air Pacific is assisting the country move forward and he highlighted how the Singaporean Superannuation Fund assisted its country in development in the early days.







Pflieger said 85%of the funding for the purchase of the three aircraft will be borrowed from offshore banks.



Air Pacific is already in talks with the European Credit Agency.

Zimbabwe’s economic recovery has just begun and will be key in the development of the Southern African region, South Africa’s ambassador to Zimbabwe Vusi Mavimbela has said.

Mavimbela was speaking at the launch an Airbus 330–200 service to Harare by South African Airways(SAA) yesterday.

The launch comes weeks after airline giant Emirates added Harare and Lusaka in Zambia as its newest destinations as part of its network expansion on the continent beginning in February next year. Emirates will also be flying the same Airbus 330-200 aircraft.

Mavimbela said Zimbabwe and South Africa were joined by “a thousand umbilical cords” and the Airbus was going to further ensure the relations were strengthened.

“The indication that the volumes of passengers are increasing also indicates that the trade relations are strengthening and the launch of the Airbus can help facilitate trade links between the two countries,” said Mavimbela.

In a speech read on his behalf by the director of the transport management division in his ministry, Allowance Sango, the Minister Transport and Infrastructural Development Nicholas Goche said SAA had contributed positively to the development of the economy."
