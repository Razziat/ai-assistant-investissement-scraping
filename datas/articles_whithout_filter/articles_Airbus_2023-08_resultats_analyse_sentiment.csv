Voyager Space and Airbus Announce Joint Venture to Build and Operate Starlab - Airbus,"Wed, 02 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0wOC12b3lhZ2VyLXNwYWNlLWFuZC1haXJidXMtYW5ub3VuY2Utam9pbnQtdmVudHVyZS10by1idWlsZC1hbmTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DENVER – 02 August, 2023 - Voyager Space (Voyager), a global leader in space exploration, and Airbus Defence and Space (Airbus), the largest aeronautics and space company in Europe, today announced an agreement paving the way for a transatlantic joint venture to develop, build, and operate Starlab, a commercial space station planned to succeed the International Space Station. The US-led joint venture will bring together world-class leaders in the space domain, while further uniting American and European interests in space exploration.



“We are proud to charter the future of space stations with Airbus,” says Matthew Kuta, President at Voyager Space. “The International Space Station is widely regarded as the most successful platform for global cooperation in space history, and we are committed to building on this legacy as we move forward with Starlab. We are establishing this joint venture to reliably meet the known demand from global space agencies while opening new opportunities for commercial users.”



Voyager was awarded a $160 million Space Act Agreement (SAA) from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in December 2021 via Nanoracks, part of Voyager’s exploration segment. Part of NASA’s Commercial Low Earth Orbit Development Program, this SAA sets the foundation to create Starlab, a continuously crewed, free-flying space station to serve NASA and a global customer base of space agencies and researchers.

The program’s mission is to maintain continued human presence and American leadership in low-Earth orbit (LEO). Today’s announcement builds on an agreement made public in January 2023, where Voyager selected Airbus to provide technical design support and expertise for Starlab.



“With a track record of innovation and technological firsts, Airbus prides itself on partnering with companies that are looking to change history,” said Jean-Marc Nasr, Head of Space Systems at Airbus. “This transatlantic venture with footprints on both sides of the ocean aligns the interests of both ourselves and Voyager and our respective space agencies. This pioneers continued European and American leadership in space that takes humanity forward. Together our teams are focused on creating an unmatched space destination both technologically and as a business operation.”



In addition to the US entity, Starlab will have a European joint venture subsidiary to directly serve the European Space Agency (ESA) and its member state space agencies.



This announcement follows a major design milestone in Starlab’s development, the Systems Requirements Review (SRR), which baselines the major space systems, technical readiness, and ability to meet NASA’s mission and safety requirements. The Starlab SRR, was completed in June 2023 in coordination with NASA’s Commercial LEO Development Program team.



“Today marks a major step forward for the future of commercial space destinations,” continues Kuta. “We are proud to have NASA’s trust to build the replacement for the ISS, a partnership that expands Starlab’s ecosystem to global space agencies, and a team that is mission driven and dedicated to reimagining the future.”



The implementation of the joint venture will be subject to applicable regulatory approvals.

Wichita State works with Airbus to prepare employees for using French during travels - Wichita State University,"Tue, 15 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpY2hpdGEuZWR1L2Fib3V0L3dzdW5ld3MvbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA4LWF1Zy9mcmVuY2hfMy5waHDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hannah Bui is now prepared to work with French-speaking colleagues at Airbus, thanks to “Business French for Beginners” taught by Wichita State University lecturer Rachelle Swilley.

“I’m ready if we have a trip to Canada,” Bui said. “If I pick up the next project and have to communicate with them, I’m confident I can introduce myself in French.”

Bui, a static stress engineer at Airbus, was one of about 15 employees who took the six-week course, taught for two hours each Friday, this summer at Airbus on WSU’s Innovation Campus.

Airbus, headquartered in France, also has nine locations in seven Canadian cities, most notably Mirabel in French-speaking Quebec. The course focuses on phrases and vocabulary that will help Airbus employees with travel and basic work interactions.

“Phrases such as, ‘I’ve been at Airbus for five years,’” Swilley said. “Checking into a hotel – ‘Where is the room? How many beds are in the room?’ Giving basic directions. Pronouncing words on a menu.”

Swilley, a 1998 graduate of Wichita State, lived in France as a child. She worked for Bombardier-Learjet in supply chain and marketing before coming to teach at Wichita State in 2007.

Rachelle Swilley

Dr. Wilson Baldridge, chair of the Department of Modern and Classical Languages and Literatures, sees the course as an important way the Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and Sciences can interact with partners on the Innovation Campus. The relationship with Airbus began with instruction in German for employees traveling to Hamburg, Germany, one of the key sites for Airbus Commercial Aircraft.

“We’re not a research department in the sense of physics or chemistry,” Baldridge said. “But we can provide instruction. We’ve gotten lots of support, moral support and financial support (from Dean Andrew Hippisley), to try to move the needle in terms of providing instructional and research service for our business partners.”

The class is built on teaching vocabulary and phrases that can be used in multiple settings. Students also used Duolingo language apps to practice.

“I would set up different scenarios and have a weekly vocabulary list with audio that they would study during the week,” Swilley said. “When we would meet in class, we mainly focused on using those phrases and that vocabulary to create real-life scenarios.”

Bui, who graduated from Wichita State University in 2015 with a degree in aerospace engineering, had no experience with French when she decided to take the class. She’s following the lead of her brother, An Bui, who is on the repair team at Airbus. He is also learning French and traveled to Airbus headquarters near Toulouse-Blagnac Airport in the southwest region of Occitania, for a month of training last year.

Hannah Bui continues to practice the language with Duolingo and YouTube videos. She also practices with Airbus friends she made in the class.

“Now we pass by, and we can say, ‘Bonjour,’” she said. “The class helped us get to know colleagues who work in a different area.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999959468841553}",neutral,0.9999959468841553,0
Lankford Completes Summer Internship with Airbus - The University of Southern Mississippi,"Mon, 28 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzbS5lZHUvbmV3cy8yMDIzL3JlbGVhc2UvbGFua2ZvcmQtYWlyYnVzLnBocNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Lankford Completes Summer Internship with Airbus

Mon, 08/28/2023 - 03:41pm | By: David Tisdale

University of Southern Mississippi (USM) graduate student Ashley Lankford gained valuable experience in corporate public relations through a summer internship with Airbus, a global pioneer in the aerospace industry that operates in the commercial aircraft, helicopters, defense, and space sectors.

A native of Satsuma, Alabama, Lankford graduated with a bachelor's degree in communication studies from USM’s School of Media and Communication in the summer of 2022. Since then, she has pursued graduate studies at the university and will finish in May 2024 with a master's degree in communications.

An Airbus recruiter emailed her in January asking if she would be interested in interning with Airbus at its Mobile, Alabama Manufacturing Site (MMS) over the summer. As a native of Mobile County, Lankford knows firsthand how impactful the company has been to her community, and immediately applied.

Airbus is a leader in designing, manufacturing, and delivering aerospace products, services, and solutions to customers worldwide. It employs approximately 134,000 people and is the largest aeronautics and space company in Europe, and a global leader in the aviation industry.

“I wanted to see how a global, for-profit organization was run,” Lankford explained. “I’ve been exposed to several non-profits, and USM has allowed me to have insight into the communications realm of higher education. I know that I want to pursue a career that is fast-paced, and the Mobile Manufacturing Site (MMS) is one of the fastest growing Airbus sites worldwide. This quick growth and constant development interested me a great deal and led to me applying.

“The opportunity to work with Airbus allowed me the chance to utilize the skills I have been taught at USM and expand my knowledge base with hands-on training in a global market.”

Lankford interned in the Airbus communications department from May 23 until Aug. 4, one of 14 interns chosen to be a part of its first official summer internship cohort. There, she was tasked with developing a strategic communications plan for the EHS (Environment, Health, and Safety) Department specifically relating to sustainability. She was also charged with creating and enhancing ISO 14001 communications, as well as Environmental Regulatory communications on site.

“The work I was able to do this summer will be used on site for a number of years to come, which was so exciting,” Lankford said.

Lankford said the biggest takeaway from her experience at Airbus was learning that it takes a team of people actively working together to achieve a goal to be successful.

“Global companies and even the Mobile Manufacturing Site are far too large for one person to tackle alone, so this summer I learned a great deal about teamwork in a professional setting,” she continued. “I also learned a lot about seeking out information that you may not know immediately. As an intern, it can be intimidating to ask questions at times, but this summer I saw first-hand how beneficial questions can be.”

Lankford also benefited from being exposed to so many people “who truly had my best interest at heart and wanted my project to succeed.”

“Most everyone I met at Airbus was beyond willing to give me greater insight into their job or offer me advice on how to make my final product better,” she said. “I was thankful for that, and was even more thankful for Ryan Hopkins in EHS, who helped me daily understand the complex world of environment regulations and environmental communications. Through this internship I was able to see how numerous positions across departments impact a final goal.”

Interning at Airbus also helped Lankford more clearly map out her interests and career goals. “Ultimately, I would like to be the chief communications officer or chief executive officer of a company. This summer allowed me to gain a greater insight into what that role may look like and exposed me to the importance of an effective communication department.”

Lankford encourages college students at every level to take advantage of internship opportunities, even if not required for graduation.

“There’s nothing like having real world experience in the field you are interested in, and internships give students the opportunity to become involved with an organization and learn so much,” she explained. “Most places want to see their interns grow in their knowledge of the company, but also in their understanding of the field they are working in. That’s invaluable as one completes their degree and pushes forward to their next goal in life.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9992881417274475}",neutral,0.9992881417274475,0

Voyager Space and Airbus create commercial space station joint venture - SpaceNews,"Wed, 02 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS92b3lhZ2VyLXNwYWNlLWFuZC1haXJidXMtY3JlYXRlLWNvbW1lcmNpYWwtc3BhY2Utc3RhdGlvbi1qb2ludC12ZW50dXJlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SEATTLE — Voyager Space is joining forces with Airbus Defence and Space on a joint venture for the development of the Starlab commercial space station.

The companies announced Aug. 2 the creation of a joint venture, also called Starlab, that will be responsible for the development and operation of the station. The joint venture builds upon an agreement announced in January where Voyager selected Airbus to provide technical support for the proposed station.

“This transatlantic venture with footprints on both sides of the ocean aligns the interests of both ourselves and Voyager and our respective space agencies,” said Jean-Marc Nasr, head of space systems at Airbus, in a statement. “Together our teams are focused on creating an unmatched space destination both technologically and as a business operation.”

The joint venture is an effort to create a long-term partnership between the companies for Starlab. “We have been working very well together as partners,” said Matthew Kuta, president of Voyager Space, in an interview. “It’s very important in the commercial world to have good long-term partnerships and less of a vendor transactional relationship, so we had discussions about forming the joint venture together.”

Kuta declined to discuss financial details of the partnership, including the share of the joint venture held by each company. However, he noted that the joint venture will be U.S.-led, meaning that at least 51% of the company will be owned by U.S. entities like Voyager Space.

Having a European company as part of the joint venture, though, could make it easier for European governments and organizations, like the European Space Agency, participate on Starlab. European officials have expressed hesitance about paying American companies for flying European astronauts, rather than the barter system used for International Space Station operations among the partner nations.

“We have great relationships with ESA, but clearly Airbus much better relationships,” Kuta said. “It allows us to figure out how we can satisfy those customer demands more directly and successfully.”

He added that he couldn’t speak for ESA’s plans after the retirement of the station, but since that agency has previously ruled out flying its astronauts on China’s Tiangong space station, its only option will be using commercial stations like Starlab. “By partnering with Airbus, we’ll be in a great position to help ESA figure out what works for them.”

Voyager Space, through Nanoracks, received a $160 million Space Act Agreement from NASA in December 2021 to support initial design work on Starlab, one of three such awards NASA issued through its Commercial LEO Destinations initiative. The Starlab team recently completed a system requirements review for the station with NASA, which Kuta said went well.

The focus of Starlab will be on research applications, rather than tourism. The station is designed to fit on a single launch, outfitted on the ground with all the research equipment needed for its customers. “All the things that ISS does is what we’re focused on being able to continue, but with more modern equipment, technologies and capabilities.”

That research interest is coming from both government agencies and companies, particularly in the pharmaceutical sector. The companies are looking at ways to allow customers to start work on facilities they operate on the ISS today, like the Airbus Bartolomeo external payload facility and Nanoracks Bishop airlock, then shift that work to Starlab.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9994600415229797}",neutral,0.9994600415229797,0

On Aug. 25th, 2023, Airbus Helicopters celebrated 20 years of manufacturing aircraft at its Columbus, Mississippi factory.

The milestone was attended by government dignitaries, high-ranking military officers and Airbus executives, and was covered by local and international media.

The day-long event began with demonstration flights in one of the flagship products built at the plant, the latest iteration of the light-twin H145, the D3 designation with its five-blade main rotor, Fenestron tail-rotor system, and four-axis autopilot.

Brent Bundy Photo

Since the day the hangar doors opened two decades ago, the H145 has been produced here. Beginning in 2007, the U.S. military version of the H145, the UH-72 Lakota, has been assembled in Mississippi.

As of 2015, the single-engine H125, popular with law enforcement, air medical and tour operators, has also been built onsite. In recognition of this latest addition to the Columbus catalog, the morning demo flights were followed by a ribbon-cutting ceremony to dedicate the recently installed H125 display, which is mounted at the entrance to the facility, similar to other Airbus facilities.

The Airbus Delivery Center was a full-house of employees, invited guests, and dignitaries during the 20th Anniversary Celebration. Brent Bundy Photo

“Twenty years ago people didn’t believe that we could build high-tech products in the middle of Mississippi,” said Johannes Dienemann, Airbus vice president of industry and civil programs and Columbus plant manager. We’ve proven them wrong.”

The colorful paint scheme on the monument aircraft is representative of the state flag and was designed in-house by one of the more than 300 workers employed at this location.

President of Airbus Helicopters/Head of North America Region Romain Trapp addresses those gathered for the event. He praised the outstanding workforce and its contributions to the company for the past two decades. Brent Bundy Photo

“This aircraft represents the past, present, and future,” said Dienemann. “Even though we’ve been here for 20 years, a lot of people in the area don’t know what we do. Having this helicopter on the stand will change that.”

The festivities then moved indoors to the delivery center, where vice president of military line of business Scott Tumpak emceed the ceremony. Accolades and recognition of accomplishments for the facility and its employees were offered by president of Airbus Helicopters Romain Trapp, U.S. Senators from Mississippi, Roger Wicker and Cindy Hyde-Smith, and U.S. Army Air and Missile Command Major General Tom O’Connor.

At the conclusion of the speeches, entertainment was provided in the form of an impressive aerial demonstration by aerobatic helicopter pilot Scott Urschel in his MBB (Airbus) Bo105. On the flight line was a collection of Airbus products including a UH-72 Lakota, U.S. Coast Guard MH-65 Dauphin, and the H160.

Earlier in the week, the U.S. Army awarded Airbus a $27.8 million contract for the upgrading of the Army National Guard S&S (Security & Support) Battalion Mission Equipment Package (MEP). This upgrade will retrofit up to 50 S&S Battalion UH-72A Lakotas with state-of-the-art apparatus including advanced infrared cameras, moving maps systems, high-definition monitors and other mission equipment improvements.

These enhancements will be implemented at the Columbus facility and Vertical was given a behind-the-scenes preview of the MEP, along with discussions with the engineers coordinating the project.

The day of celebration concluded with a tour of the 325,000 square-foot factory. Senior manager of production Ben Sullivan explained each step of the build process, from parts delivery through construction and testing to the final paint shop and flight line completion.

H125s and H145s, including the UH-72, are assembled concurrently along parallel assembly lines in the main building, which allows for 70 to 90 aircraft a year to be delivered from this location. In addition, the completions area can make modifications, repairs, and other customer requests for a variety of Airbus models.

Vertical then sat down with Trapp to discuss the significance of this anniversary and what it means to Airbus as well as the local community.

“This is a very important day for us,” he said. “The Mississippi location is our third largest, in terms of number of aircraft completed. Every year we deliver between 70 and 90 aircraft and plan to hit 100 eventually. That is about 20 percent of all Airbus helicopter deliveries. This facility has really helped in expanding our presence in the U.S. market. Since it opened, over 1,700 aircraft have left here.”

When asked about the impact on the region, Trapp’s respect and appreciation for the workforce was evident.

“It has always been very important for us to be local. When we were searching for a new location, several things were necessary. We needed to be close to an airport that was large enough but not too busy, and also allowed for expansion, as we’ve done over the past 20 years.

“We learned that in this area there are a lot of veterans from each of the armed forces who wanted to come back to Mississippi but there was no aerospace industry. This allowed us to hire without competition. Also, Mississippi is a business-friendly environment with strong support in the government, from the governor to the congresspersons, to the senators. They wanted us here and it helped make a difference.”

Holding steadfast to Airbus’ support for military veterans, 35 percent of the Columbus facility workforce is made up of those who have served their country.

“We are very proud of the veterans we have hired, and we have seen generational hiring,” said Trapp. “Columbus is a family, and we are part of that family. We sponsor events, we partner with educational institutions. We do this because we are a part of this community.”

While Airbus Helicopters celebrates 20 years in Columbus, sights are already set on the future.

As UH-72 Lakotas, H145s and H125s continue to roll off the assembly line, the recent awarding of the S&S MEP contract and the announcement of two new H125 variants, the AH-125 armed version and the MH-125 multi-role configuration — both of which will be produced here — Airbus has shown its commitment to remaining in the Golden Triangle region of Mississippi.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999938011169434}",neutral,0.9999938011169434,0

Designed in line with latest production and sustainability standards

Hamburg, 30 August 2023 – Airbus is advancing its industrial system and expanding ramp-up capacity with a new automated A321XLR equipping hangar, officially opened today by Hamburg’s First Mayor Peter Tschentscher and German Aerospace Coordinator Anna Christmann. With this, Airbus continues its modernisation and digitalisation of its industrial system and expands its capacity for the rate ramp-up in the A320 programme to 75 in 2026.

“Airbus’ Hamburg site plays a significant role in the development and production of the A321XLR. With our new, state-of-the-art equipment installation hangar, we are now expanding our capacity to manufacture A321 fuselages and making an important contribution to supporting our ramp up. At the same time we are reaffirming the importance of Hamburg for Airbus,” said André Walter, Head of Airbus Commercial Aircraft Production in Germany. “The design of the building reflects the latest standards in production and sustainability.”

Dr Peter Tschentscher, First Mayor of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg: “Hamburg is the central location for Airbus’ single-aisle development and production. With the A321XLR, the new flagship of the A320 Family will be assembled at the Finkenwerder site, setting new standards in terms of sustainability, efficiency and range. The start of production in the new equipment installation hangar is an important project for Hamburg as the world’s third largest civil aviation center.”

“This investment in the A321XLR equipment installation hangar at the Airbus Hamburg site is an important milestone towards transitioning aviation to climate neutrality. This transformation is the key to making Germany a future-oriented and competitive aerospace location,” said Anna Christmann, the Federal Government Coordinator of German Aerospace Policy. “I am delighted that Airbus is positioning itself as a trailblazer in sustainable aviation and that we are pulling together to accelerate progress toward climate-neutral aviation even further.”

In the new equipment installation hangar, with 9,600 m2 of production space, designated H259, all the components of the rear fuselages of the A321XLR aircraft – also built in Hamburg – will be installed and mounted. The hangar is equipped with a full range of state-of-the-art technologies for operations and manufacturing, such as automated logistics, fully digital systems, and test stations that can output the status of each fuselage section (both in terms of logistics and resources) at any time. The almost 24-metre-long fuselage sections are equipped with all electrical and mechanical systems, as well as other elements such as windows, floor panels or external antennas, on an automated ‘pulse line’ consisting of eight stations. Each fuselage section is extensively tested directly after the installation of the systems. The fuselage sections are then transferred to the final assembly line in Hamburg.

The stations in the new hangar were planned in close consultation with the employees to create both an efficient production flow and an ergonomically optimised and modern working environment. In addition, the interior design also focused on ensuring optimal conditions for cooperation between the employees in production and the supporting functions.

The structure was planned and built sustainably. A 3,000 m2 photovoltaic system on the roof supplies the hangar with electricity, and surpluses are used to power the site. The office block on the south side offers an excellent level of insulation thanks to extensive insulation of the ceiling and walls. A fully automatic control system for heating, ventilation and lighting complements the measures.

About the new A321XLR

The A321XLR is the next evolutionary step of the A320neo, in response to market demands for even more range and payload, creating more added value for the airlines. It will deliver an unprecedented (‘Xtra-long’) range of up to 4,700 nm – 15% more range than the A321LR – and with 30% lower fuel burn per seat compared with previous-generation competitor aircraft, as well as reduced NOx emissions and noise. For passengers, the A321XLR’s new Airspace cabin will provide the best travel experience, while offering seats in all classes with the same high-comfort as on a long-haul wide-body, with the low costs of a single-aisle aircraft. The A321XLR currently has nearly 570 orders from 27 customers worldwide. Entry-into-service is planned for the second quarter of 2024.

"Boeing’s on the back foot in China, but is the door still open amid US tensions? - South China Morning Post","Sat, 05 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY21wLmNvbS9lY29ub215L2dsb2JhbC1lY29ub215L2FydGljbGUvMzIzMDAyNC9ib2VpbmctYmVpbmctZWRnZWQtb3V0LWFpcmJ1cy1jaGluYXMtYXZpYXRpb24tbWFya2V0LXRoZXJlLXdheS1iYWNrLWFtaWQtdXMtdGVuc2lvbnPSAZABaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc2NtcC5jb20vZWNvbm9teS9nbG9iYWwtZWNvbm9teS9hcnRpY2xlLzMyMzAwMjQvYm9laW5nLWJlaW5nLWVkZ2VkLW91dC1haXJidXMtY2hpbmFzLWF2aWF0aW9uLW1hcmtldC10aGVyZS13YXktYmFjay1hbWlkLXVzLXRlbnNpb25z?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The narrowbody passenger jet fleet size in China grew by 18 per cent as of July compared to July 2018, while the number of widebody passenger jets rose by 26 per cent, the data showed.

Although domestic travel in China declined and its borders were largely closed for international flights during the coronavirus pandemic, Chinese airlines expanded their fleets, mainly by purchasing from Airbus, according to Cirium Ascend fleet data.

Chinese airlines’ need to renew their fleets of aircraft could offer an opportunity for Boeing, but ongoing US tensions and the launch of China’s first domestically built narrowbody passenger jet may undermine its efforts to compete with European rival Airbus and pick up new orders in the critical aviation market.

The increase mainly came from Airbus’ A320neo, A321neo and A350-900, while the contribution to China’s fleet from Boeing’s 737 MAX 8 and 787-9 were relatively marginal over the same period.

Despite the lack of Boeing orders from China’s airlines, growth has still been possible Rob Morris

“Hence, despite the lack of Boeing orders from China’s airlines, growth has still been possible albeit clearly not at the same trajectory as seen in the mid-part of the last decade,” said Rob Morris, head of consultancy at Ascend by Cirium.

Last year, Boeing said it was disappointed that “geopolitical differences continued to constrain US aircraft exports” in response to China’s three biggest state-owned airlines buying 300 jets from Airbus.

But the Chicago-based aerospace company may be able to stage a comeback as the average age of Chinese airlines’ fleet has risen significantly over the past five years.

China’s fleet will require more new planes to facilitate growth and replacements following disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the suspension of the production of the 737 MAX, according to Morris.

China was the first country to ground the 737 MAX in March 2019 after 346 people died in two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia less than five months apart, and Boeing’s flagship narrowbody passenger jet only returned to service in China in January.

Cirium’s most recent fleet forecast in November projected that airlines in China will need some 2,800 new narrowbody jets and 600 new widebody jets over the next 10 years. The average age of a narrowbody passenger jet in China is 8.7 years and 7.6 years for a widebody aircraft, the Cirium fleet data showed.

Given both Boeing and Airbus currently hold a large order backlog, Chinese airlines may increasingly find it difficult to secure delivery slots before 2030, Morris added.

“Hence, if Boeing are permitted to recommence deliveries into China once again, then there may be an opportunity for the company to sell more units if there are slots available,” Morris said.

We are not dependent on it. We want to do it, and we certainly want to support our customers in China Dave Calhoun

In July, Boeing executive vice-president Stan Deal met the head of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, Song Zhiyong, in Beijing, according to a statement from the regulator. The two exchanged views on Boeing’s business development in China and the strengthening of US-China civil aviation cooperation, the statement added.

Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said in an earnings call with analysts at the end of July that more than 90 per cent of its 737 MAX were now back in service in China, and that the company is receiving “a lot of good signs” when it comes to resuming deliveries.

“We are not dependent on it. We want to do it, and we certainly want to support our customers in China. And we will be the free-trade beacon with respect to our administration and – and all the political influences,” said Calhoun.

“But I’m just going to leave it postured just the way it has been. Know that we have 85 airplanes that we would like to begin delivery on.”

Stephen Olson, a senior research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation, believes that Airbus remains “geopolitically better positioned than Boeing” to meet the demand from China’s state-owned airlines.

“As the US-China geostrategic rivalry continues to play out, China needs to curry favour with the European Union (EU) in order to prevent the EU from aligning too closely with the more confrontational policies being pursued by the US,” said Olson, a former trade negotiator with the Office of the US Trade Representative.

“A fully united US-EU common front on China policy would be highly problematic for Beijing.”

And ordering from Airbus, rather than Boeing, could also be an effective way to remind the EU of the economic benefits of maintaining positive and constructive relations with China, Olson added.

China’s heavy investment in grooming a domestic champion in the civil aviation industry also means that the need to order from foreign competitors is diminishing, Olson said.

A second C919, the narrowbody passenger jet built by the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), to enter service made its first commercial flight with China Eastern Airlines this week.

The C919, which is designed to compete with Boeing’s 737 and Airbus’ A320, was formally put into service with its maiden commercial flight in May after 15 years of development.

Comac has said its annual production capacity is expected to reach over 150 in the next five years.

Whether or not Boeing will specifically be on the agenda for her upcoming meetings in Beijing is hard to know at this point Stephen Olson

Olson said that the US would continue to seek to expand trade with China away from sensitive sectors, despite rising tensions and the various bilateral restrictions.

On Monday, Bloomberg News reported that US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo is set to visit Beijing later this month, citing unidentified sources.

Raimondo has previously criticised Beijing for preventing its domestic airlines from buying Boeing planes.

“As secretary of commerce, Gina Raimondo is America’s business ambassador, and I would expect that expanding US exports would be on the agenda of almost any meeting she has with foreign officials,” Olson added.

“Whether or not Boeing will specifically be on the agenda for her upcoming meetings in Beijing is hard to know at this point, but pushing for greater market access is a foundational cornerstone of any commerce secretary’s portfolio.”","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9976286292076111}",negative,0.9976286292076111,-1

Emirates is by far the largest operator of the A380, and for June 2023, they are flying 85% of hours when compared to June 2019. With the A380 remaining the backbone of the Emirates fleet, we should continue to see the amount of utilization increase.

British Airways are operating their A380s at nearly 95% of 2019 levels. This is an important aircraft for the slot restrained London Heathrow airport, with other operators also using the A380 in/out of Heathrow.

Lufthansa have said that they will not return all their A380s to the air post-pandemic, but they are still up at 70% of June 2019 levels in June 2023.

Qatar, the airline that really wanted to not return the A380 to service, are at 66% of 2019 levels, again putting it on routes including Heathrow, showing how important the aircraft can be in the current climate.

Most other A380 operators are below the 60% utilization mark when compared to June 2019, with Air France, China Southern Airlines, HiFly, Malaysia Airlines, and Thai Airways all having removed the A380 from their fleets completely.

Overall utilization for June 2023 is at 60% of 2019.

The U.S. Army awarded Airbus a $27.8 million contract to upgrade the Army National Guard Security & Support Battalion Mission Equipment Package (MEP).

Upgrades to the MEP expand the UH-72A Lakota’s capabilities to conduct day and night operations by providing an advanced moving map, enhanced digital interfaces, new monitors, an airborne mission management system and other system improvements.

“This award provides pilots with significantly increased functionality and capability to carry out today’s demanding missions, further enhancing the Lakota’s value as an ISR asset for the National Guard,” said Scott Tumpak, vice president of military line of business for Airbus U.S. Space and Defense.

MEP-equipped UH-72As are specifically designed to execute National Guard operations across a range of missions including domestic operations, counter-drug and border security.

The Army contract will retrofit up to 50 Security & Support Battalion aircraft deployed throughout the United States. There are currently 107 in the fleet.

These aircraft will be modified at Airbus’ Columbus, Mississippi, helicopter production facility, where more than 480 UH-72A and UH-72B Lakota, based on the Airbus H145, have been delivered to the U.S. Army since 2006.

The contract will be managed by Airbus U.S. Space & Defense.

Lovely: Lufthansa Airbus A380 First Class - One Mile at a Time,"Sun, 20 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL2luc2lnaHRzL2x1ZnRoYW5zYS1hMzgwLWZpcnN0LWNsYXNzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hello from Boston! I just wrapped up my trip to Germany with my parents, and on the return we flew Lufthansa’s Airbus A380 first class from Munich to Boston. My gosh, what a treat this flight was, especially since I managed to snag us four first class award seats, so we had half the cabin to ourselves!

While I’ll have a full trip report soon, in this post I wanted to share some initial impressions of the flight.

Lufthansa’s first class hard product is a bit better on the A380

Lufthansa only recently reactivated its Airbus A380s, and what a treat it is to see the whale jet flying again for Lufthansa!

Lufthansa Airbus A380 Munich Airport

Until Lufthansa’s new first class product is introduced, the airline is incredibly consistent with its first class hard product. The airline has the same seats on the A380s, A340s, and 747s. The A380 and A340 cabins almost look identical, while the 747 cabin is just configures a bit differently, given that it’s in the nose of the plane.

I do have to say, I really enjoy Lufthansa’s first class product on the A380. For one, the A380 is a pleasure to fly, given how quiet the aircraft is.

Furthermore, the A380 has much nicer lavatories than you’ll find on Lufthansa’s other aircraft, and they even have urinals (which… I always found to be an unusual feature).

Lufthansa Airbus A380 first class bathroom

I also love how the Airbus A380 has a tail camera, which you won’t find on other Lufthansa aircraft with first class.

Lufthansa Airbus A380 first class tail camera

While Lufthansa’s seats aren’t very private, the bedding is excellent, and I find this to be one of the most comfortable beds in the sky.

Lufthansa Airbus A380 first class bed

Like on Lufthansa’s other aircraft, the entertainment on the A380 is cutting edge… if it were 2007. The entertainment is awful, both in terms of the selection, and in terms of the quality of the screen. Fortunately Lufthansa offers free Wi-Fi in first class, so I consider that to be a fair tradeoff.

The service & food on this flight were great

I find Lufthansa to be quite consistent with service in first class, and crews usually range from good to excellent. I have to say, the crew on this flight couldn’t have been better. The two flight attendants working first class were fabulously friendly and attentive, and took such good care of my family. They were among the most professional Lufthansa flight attendants I’ve ever had.

Heck, even the captain came to the upper deck during boarding to greet each first class passenger. I find that happens maybe every 10 flights or so, and it’s always a cute touch, so I guess the stars really aligned on this flight in terms of service. I couldn’t help but ask the captain a few questions about his thoughts on the return of the A380, and he was happy to chat for a moment (we were delayed quite a bit due to late connecting passengers).

Not only was the service good, but the food on this flight was among the best I’ve had on Lufthansa. For one, the champagne selection was exceptional, which wasn’t the case on my previous Lufthansa flight. The rose champagne on offer was Laurent-Perrier 2007 Grande Cuve Rose Alexandra.

There was also Laurent-Perrier Grand Siecle, which I enjoyed.

The meal was quite good too, and started with caviar, and a delicious appetizer trio of chicken, tataki salmon, and carrot rolls.

Lufthansa first class meal

For the main course, I mixed things up (that’s right, I didn’t have fish!), and ordered the pecorino ravioli, which was one of the best ravioli dishes I’ve had on a plane.

Lufthansa first class meal

Then for dessert I had a tarte tatin with vanilla ice cream.

For the pre-arrival meal I asked for the beyond meat burger, which was surprisingly well executed for being served on a plane.

The real treat was sharing the experience with loved ones

What made this flight the best, though, was being able to share it with my mom, her partner, and my dad. I managed to snag four award seats a bit under a week before departure (there were even more award seats than that available!), so locking that all in with miles was awesome.

Flying first class alone is fun, but seeing family and loved ones enjoying a great experience is even more enjoyable. We all had the best time imaginable, and didn’t want the flight to end. I’m not exaggerating when I say that it’s a flight I’ll never forget, since it’s rare you get to have memories like that!

While there are better hard products out there, Lufthansa first class is the most readily available first class product across the Atlantic using transferable points. There are no fuel surcharges, award space regularly opens up within days of departure, and there are often multiple seats.

Bottom line

We had an excellent flight in Lufthansa’s A380 first class. The hard product was as expected, though the soft product was among the best I’ve had on Lufthansa, with a lovely crew, top notch champagne, and good food.

I’m happy to see Lufthansa continue to expand its first class footprint, since it’s great for those of us looking to redeem miles. That was especially true on this flight, where I managed to book us four first class award seats.

HPM is actively planning and working from corner to corner of the entire Airbus manufacturing campus in Mobile, with a focus on new installations and upgrades to existing facilities to support a manufacturing rate increase of single-aisle passenger jets.

The plans include over a dozen new structures that will add 1 million square feet of space to Airbus’ facility, effectively doubling the aircraft plant’s production area. Airbus is targeting the third quarter of 2025 for completion of the growth project.

“The expansion of our industrial footprint in Alabama is an important part of Airbus’ global single-aisle aircraft production increase,” said Daryl Taylor, Head of Commercial Operations for Airbus in the U.S.

“We look forward to continuing to partner closely with the State of Alabama and our industry partners to solidify our region’s position in the aerospace sector.”

Greg Canfield, Secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce, said Airbus represents a lynchpin in his team’s multi-faceted efforts to secure new industry investment and jobs for the state.

“Aerospace industry growth continues to be a high-value opportunity for Alabama, not only in terms of capital investment but also in job creation,” said Secretary Canfield, who led an Alabama business development team at the 2023 Paris Air Show.

“There are exceptional developments taking place right now in aerospace and aviation in the state, and we’re seeing that encapsulated with the expansion project taking shape at Airbus’ manufacturing center in Mobile,” he added.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9602402448654175}",positive,0.9602402448654175,1

El Al, established in 1948, has been a loyal Boeing customer from the start, operating nearly all the OEM’s types: the 707, 720, 737-200, 737NG, 747, 757 and 767, including several variations of each as well as several freighter aircraft. A decision in favor of Airbus would be an historic change—it can be expected that Boeing will prepare a counteroffer.

The carrier plans to replace 24 737-800/900s—which have an average age of 19 years—and may increase its narrowbody fleet to 28-31 aircraft by 2028. A decision likely would be made early in 2024, and the carrier is negotiating with both OEMs.

El Al launched its narrowbody fleet replacement campaign in April and also invited engine manufacturers. The airline is also in talks with Boeing regarding the 737 MAX, the CEO told Reuters on the sidelines of the conference.

The Israeli carrier also unveiled a new five-year strategic plan that should grow the fleet from 46 aircraft to 59 by 2028. The company said in an Aug. 10 statement that it intends to bring back into service most of the aircraft currently not in use until the end of 2024. According to the Aviation Week Network Fleet Discovery database, two 737-800s and three 777-200s are in storage.

Meanwhile, a retrofit process has begun on some of the 777s to align the aircraft with the 787 comfort experience. The first retrofitted 777 began operations in August and three additional aircraft will be phased in by year-end. The four 777-200s were built in 2001, 2002 and 2007. El Al plans to operate a fifth 777 in 2024.

In July, El Al received its 16th 787, and the delivery flight was powered by about 30% sustainable aviation fuel, the first use of biofuel for the carrier. The airline said it expects to receive an additional 787 purchased from Boeing in the second quarter of 2024. The 787-8/787-9 fleet should reach a size of 22 aircraft by 2028.

Ganancia, who became CEO in May 2022, told Aviation Daily at the sidelines of the IATA AGM in June in Istanbul that the opening of new air routes—enabled with overflight permission from Saudi Arabia and Oman—allows the carrier to expand its network farther, such as to Asia and to Australia.

This year, El Al launched flights to Istanbul, Dublin and Tokyo and expects to add Mumbai, India, and Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In the last 12 months, the airline transported 5.2 million passengers with 47 aircraft to 59 destinations and a load factor of 86%.

El Al recorded a net profit of $59 million for the 2023 second quarter (Q2) versus a loss of $16.7 million for the same period a year earlier. Revenue increased 22% to $630 million from $516 million in Q2 2022.

The carrier said that for 2028, when the fleet should be at 59 aircraft, it is targeting $3.5 billion in annual revenue and 7.7 million passengers, including a 24% market share at its Ben Gurion International Airport hub.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999939203262329}",neutral,0.9999939203262329,0

Voyager and Airbus Team Up To Replace The ISS - Payload,"Wed, 02 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vcGF5bG9hZHNwYWNlLmNvbS92b3lhZ2VyLWFuZC1haXJidXMtdGVhbS11cC10by1yZXBsYWNlLXRoZS1pc3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Two major space companies are joining forces to make a commercial successor to the ISS a reality.

On Tuesday, Voyager Space and Airbus Defence and Space announced a joint venture to build and operate Starlab, a LEO space station designed by Nanoracks, a department of Voyager Space.

“The International Space Station is widely regarded as the most successful platform for global cooperation in space history,” Voyager Space President Matthew Kuta said in a statement. “We are establishing this joint venture to reliably meet the known demand from global space agencies while opening new opportunities for commercial users.”

Some context: If this news sounds a bit familiar, it’s because Airbus and Voyager announced in January that Airbus would offer technical design support for Starlab. Now, the company is taking on a bigger role by having a hand in also building and operating the station.

The station is expected to be operational by 2028, and it’s inching closer to that goal: back in June, Starlab passed its systems requirement review, which proved its ability to meet NASA’s mission readiness and safety baseline requirements.

A commercial future: The future of space is looking a lot different than it did when the ISS launched in the ‘90’s. Now, space stations need to hold up to more use cases in commercial space exploration (movies in space, anyone?). We’re living in a world—ahem, universe—where countries could access space without an enormous upfront investment, or tourists could spend a couple nights among the stars.

Starlab, which is partially funded by a $160M space act agreement with NASA, is expected to be able to hold four people and will be used to conduct scientific research.

More to come: Starlab isn’t the only commercial space station in the works. Blue Origin received $130M From NASA for its space station, Orbital Reef, and Northrop Grumman nabbed $125.6M from the space agency for an unnamed space station.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9975312352180481}",neutral,0.9975312352180481,0

San Diego Police set to acquire three additional Airbus H125 helicopters - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 15 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3Mvc2FuLWRpZWdvLXBvbGljZS1zZXQtdG8tYWNxdWlyZS10aHJlZS1hZGRpdGlvbmFsLWFpcmJ1cy1oMTI1LWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"San Diego Police Department is replacing its fleet of Airbus AS350 B3 AStars with the more modern H125. Trevor Riley Photo

San Diego Police Department is poised to acquire three new Airbus H125 helicopters to complete a fleet renewal process that will replace its aging Airbus AS350 B3s.

The $16 million acquisition received the green light from city council in early August 2023. It authorizes the city to purchase two H125 aircraft in the 2024 fiscal year, with the third aircraft to be purchased in the 2025 fiscal year.

If all goes according to plan, these new platforms will join one H125 already in service with the police department’s Air Support Unit, which was purchased in December 2019 and delivered in 2020, per a city staff report.

The transaction includes anticipated trade-in value of about $800,000 for each of the B3 aircraft, which the police department acquired in 2004 and 2005. Each of the legacy aircraft has about 13,000 hours of flight time.

The San Diego air support unit averages over 2,800 flight hours per year, city officials said.

A fleet analysis pointed to increasing maintenance costs and extended out-of-service time as reasons not to retain the existing fleet. The city opted to replace the fleet in phases, with Airbus providing the airframes and managing completion of the new H125s.

Hangar One Avionics and Maintenance of Carlsbad, California, has been tapped to undertake the aircraft completion work under supervision by Airbus, per the report.

The new H125s will undergo a mission configuration installation process that includes a public address (PA) system, spotlight, radios, navigation equipment and wiring installation.

Payment for the new aircraft will be provided over a 10-year period.

Annual maintenance costs for the legacy AS350 B3 helicopters have risen to $1.6 million, according the San Diego Union-Tribune.

Maintenance for the new H125s is projected to be a “small fraction of the costs for each of the three older models,” the paper reported, citing comments from San Diego Police Lt. Rick Aguilar.

Airbus won the contract in a competitive bid. Its agreement with the city required the acceptance of trade-in aircraft.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999938011169434}",neutral,0.9999938011169434,0
Uniting A400M Forces - Airbus,"Tue, 01 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTA4LXVuaXRpbmctYTQwMG0tZm9yY2Vz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The European A400M operators - France, Germany, BeLux, Spain, and the UK as an observer - are improving its interoperability and boosting its military readiness while reducing costs, thanks to the Lighthouse Project, an initiative coordinated by the European Air Transport Command (EATC).

Better Sweat in Training than Bleed in Battle. The motto belonging to the European Tactical Airlift Program (ETAP) doesn’t leave room for ambiguity. With the Ukraine war at Europe’s doorstep, joint training and, thus, enhancing European operational capabilities in tactical airlift are more essential than ever for European Air Forces.

During 15 days in June, France, Germany, BeLux and Spain participated with five A400Ms and one CN235, in an ETAP exercise that took place at 123 Orléans-Bricy air base, north-central France. The United Kingdom was also involved as an observer.

During the training, eight flight missions and 48 flights were planned with a 91.7% success rate.

“Can we fight together?”

“The question is not only whether we can fight, but rather whether we can fight together,”said Lt. Colonel Arnaud Viltart of the French Air Force. It was during this ETAP exercise that the first Lighthouse Project event was launched by the European Air Transport Command (EATC - watch out, not to be confused with ETAP).

“Multinational procurement of weapons systems is only the start,” said Major General Andreas Schick, Commander of EATC. “With the Lighthouse project, we would like to set all the fundamentals and the prerequisites to be able to also multinationally sustain and employ these kind of weapon systems which have been procured before.”

The Lighthouse Project has four pillars: cross-maintenance, cross-ground handling, cross-mission preparation and cross-parachuting, with the A400M as a catalyst due to its primacy as the predominant air mobility platform in Europe.

Multinational teams working on the A400M

Following the publication of the first cross-maintenance operations manual for the A400M by EATC in April 2023, the first operational demonstration kicked off in Orléans, with the establishment of multinational teams of technicians working on the A400M.

“During two weeks there was no German technician working on a German aircraft, so all the work had to be done by Belgian, French and Spanish technicians. That was the idea behind it and it worked perfectly,” said German Captain Cornelius, responsible for the technicians in the line maintenance at Wunstorf air base.

According to Major Rubí, from the Spanish Air Force and in charge of the A400M maintenance team at Zaragoza air base, every day there was a meeting in which the teams were charged to “get confidence to work together”. “Once we did that, we decided which nation could put the technicians to perform the preflight, post-flights or even the scheduled maintenance,” he said.

With the assistance of Airbus Services, the team shared spare parts and managed to save two flights. “We had an engine issue [in a Belgian A400m] that was fixed with spares from France that we got here by a French team, without almost any intervention from Belgium, so it was a really nice task,” said Andy, Belgian Air Force maintenance director for the Lighthouse Project.

“Knowledge means everything”

Even if there is still a long way to go, the idea behind the Lighthouse Project is to apply this new way of working in the future, in operational missions or long-range deployments, such as Rapid Pacific of the German Air Force or Operation Pégase of the French Air Force.

“For example, we have an aircraft somewhere in the world with a technical problem and Belgian technicians may be available there, on a basis; so they would be able to perform the tasks on the German aircraft, so we don’t keep the aircraft grounded for three days, but maybe just one day,” said Captain Cornelius, from the German Air Force.

This concept of sharing and pooling resources and procedures would reduce the logistical footprint from the partner nations and allow the sharing of knowledge with the A400M operators.

“In our branch, knowledge means everything and it is often acquired at a much too high a price, especially because specific talents are too scarce within the mission support community,” said Captain Peter Wijnants, from the 15th Wing Air Transport, Belgian Air Force. “The platform that the Lighthouse Project offers would enable lateral exchange of such knowledge.”

Tous pour un, un pour tous

After a successful first edition, the focus is now on the Green Flag exercise in November in the United States with a German and Spanish A400M. This time, the complexity of the cross-maintenance and cross-operations will be greater, with the aim of increasing harmonisation amongst partner nations in the air-mobility spectrum.

And if everything goes according to plan, this joint venture will extend to other platforms such as the A330 MRTT, operated in Europe by France, Spain, the UK, along with NATO’s Multinational MRTT Fleet (Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway and the Netherlands).

It was almost 180 years ago when French writer Alexandre Dumas popularised the sentence “Tous pour un, un pour tous” [All for one, one for all] in his famous novel The Three Musketeers. Time has not passed in vain and this motto is as valid as it was then.

"BMW Group, Airbus and Quantinuum collaborate to fast-track sustainable mobility research using cutting-edge ... - BMW Press","Wed, 02 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiyAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcmVzcy5ibXdncm91cC5jb20vZ2xvYmFsL2FydGljbGUvZGV0YWlsL1QwNDI2NTc5RU4vYm13LWdyb3VwLWFpcmJ1cy1hbmQtcXVhbnRpbnV1bS1jb2xsYWJvcmF0ZS10by1mYXN0LXRyYWNrLXN1c3RhaW5hYmxlLW1vYmlsaXR5LXJlc2VhcmNoLXVzaW5nLWN1dHRpbmctZWRnZS1xdWFudHVtLWNvbXB1dGVycz9sYW5ndWFnZT1lbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Munich/Toulouse/Cambridge. Airbus, BMW Group and Quantinuum, world leaders in mobility and quantum technologies, have developed a hybrid quantum-classical workflow to speed up future research using Quantum Computers to simulate quantum systems, focusing on the chemical reactions of catalysts in fuel cells.



In a new technical paper, ""Applicability of Quantum Computing to Oxygen Reduction Reaction Simulations"", the three partners report accurately modeling the oxygen reduction reaction (""ORR"") on the surface of a platinum-based catalyst. The ORR is the chemical reaction in the process that converts hydrogen and oxygen into water and electricity in a fuel cell and it limits the efficiency of the process. It is relatively slow and requires a large amount of platinum catalyst, so there is great interest and value in better understanding the underlying mechanisms involved in the reaction.



Using Quantinuum's H-Series Quantum Computer, the collaboration team has demonstrated the applicability of Quantum Computing in an industrial workflow to enhance our understanding of a critical chemical reaction. The three companies plan further collaboration to explore the use of Quantum Computing to address relevant industrial challenges.



Dr. Peter Lehnert, Vice-President, Research Technologies at BMW Group stated: “Circularity and sustainable mobility are putting us on a quest for new materials, to create more efficient products and shape the future premium user experience. Being able to simulate material properties to relevant chemical accuracy with the benefits from the accelerating Quantum Computing hardware is giving us just the right tools for more speed in innovation for this decisive domain.”



As a pioneer in the global automotive market BMW Group recognizes the transformative potential of Quantum Computing and its importance in researching new materials, where it can enable faster and more efficient processes while reducing lab prototypes. Approaching and accurately simulating one of the most fundamental electrochemical processes for the first time using Quantum Computing marks a substantial step towards the sustainable energy transition, benefiting metal-air batteries, and other products with enhanced efficiency.



Isabell Gradert, Vice-President, Central Research & Technology at Airbus said: “We can clearly envision the benefits of the study in our quest for sustainable and hydrogen powered alternatives such as the ZEROe aircraft, which may operate on fuel cell engines. The study confirms that Quantum Computing is maturing at the scale we need for aviation.”



Airbus has identified hydrogen as a promising candidate to power low-carbon aircraft, because it emits no CO2 when flying, when generated from renewable energy. The company previously announced plans to start testing a hydrogen-powered fuel cell propulsion system onboard its ZEROe demonstrator aircraft in the next few years. The company has the ambition to develop the world’s first hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft for market entry by 2035.



Ilyas Khan, Chief Product Officer, Quantinuum said: “We have been excited to be working for some time now to support the BMW Group and Airbus, both leaders in their fields, and both of whom recognize that Quantum Computing could play a pivotal role in advancing future sustainable mobility. In this pioneering work, we demonstrate how to integrate Quantum Computing into the industrial workflows of two of the world's most technologically advanced companies, tackling material science problems that are a prime target for progress using Quantum Computing.""



The research team hopes that understanding the ORR reaction provides insights that help them identify alternative materials that may improve the performance and reduce the production costs of fuel cells. Modeling chemical reactions such as the ORR accurately is an intractable task for classical computers, due to the quantum properties of the chemical mechanisms involved, making such simulations a good candidate to benefit from a potential quantum advantage in the future.

Aegean A320neo Business Class: Best In Europe? - One Mile at a Time,"Thu, 31 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL2luc2lnaHRzL2FlZ2Vhbi1hMzIwbmVvLWJ1c2luZXNzLWNsYXNzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hello from Athens! After flying LOT Polish Airlines’ Boeing 787 business class from Chicago to Warsaw and spending a (lovely) night in Warsaw, we connected to Aegean Airlines’ Airbus A320neo business class to Athens.

I’ve always enjoyed my flights with Aegean, and was looking forward to flying the carrier’s new generation aircraft, as the airline is taking delivery of dozens of A320neos and A321neos.

Intra-Europe business class isn’t much to get excited about, though I have to say that I think Aegean might just have among the best product you’ll find in Europe, other than on Turkish Airlines (some people take issue with me categorizing Turkish Airlines as a European carrier for these purposes, even though Istanbul Airport is on the European side of the city… I digress).

While I’ll have a full review soon, in this post I wanted to share some initial thoughts on the Aegean business class experience…

Aegean’s A320neo business class hard product is fine

This was my first time flying on one of Aegean’s “neo” aircraft, and in this case I was on an A320neo that was just a few months old. Intra-Europe business class simply consists of economy seats at the front of the cabin with a blocked middle.

Aegean Airlines Airbus A320neo

Look, there’s absolutely nothing exciting about this product, but this is the same configuration you’ll find on all major European carriers, except Turkish Airlines and Aeroflot (with the latter not being terribly relevant nowadays).

Aegean’s A320neos have 180 seats, so it’s a typically cramped configuration. I do like the modern feeling of the cabin and the cabin finishes. It’s amazing how much of a difference cool headrest covers can make.

Aegean Airlines Airbus A320neo business class seats

So, what’s different about Aegean’s A320neos vs. the previous generation aircraft? The seats are a bit more “modern,” for better or worse. They’re thinner, as you’d expect, though they do have some improved tech.

There are portable device holders on the back of the seats, and there are also charging ports. However, I find it strange that the airline chose to exclusively install USB-A outlets, when the European Union is mandating USB-C chargers for many electronics nowadays. It shows you just how quickly technology evolves, eh?

Aegean also has high speed Wi-Fi on its A320neos, which is a much appreciated change. Wi-Fi is free for business class passengers, and just €9 for the entire flight in economy.

Aegean Airlines Airbus A320neo inflight Wi-Fi

So I’d say the hard product is totally fine, but nothing special.

Aegean’s business class food & service are great

What really sets Aegean business class apart is the soft product. It’s really the littlest things that make a difference, given the pretty low standard of service on short haul flights within Europe.

For example, Aegean offers pre-departure drinks in business class, which very few airlines within Europe do.

Aegean Airlines business class pre-departure drinks

The airline also offers menus in business class, even on a short two hour flight, which you won’t find on many airlines within Europe.

Aegean Airlines business class menus

Aegean also has tasty food, in my opinion. I had a delicious omelet with tomato sauce, olives, and feta.

Aegean Airlines business class meal

The drink selection is impressive as well, with proper cappuccinos. I can’t think of many other major European airline offering cappuccinos on short haul flights, so that’s pretty awesome. If the flight were later in the day, I would have had some wine, as Aegean has quite a nice list of Greek wines.

Aegean Airlines business class cappuccino

On top of that, I’ve found Aegean flight attendants to be consistently friendly and professional, and this flight was no exception.

Bottom line

While short haul business class flights within Europe offer among the worst premium experience you’ll find anywhere in the world, Aegean offers one of my favorite products in the region. The airline has pre-departure drinks, menus, tasty food, and espresso-based drinks, which is more than I can say about any other major European airline. I also appreciate the high speed Wi-Fi Aegean has on its newer aircraft, though I wish the airline had USB-C or AC power outlets.

Airbus and US space exploration firm Voyager Space announced Wednesday a joint venture to develop Starlab, a commercial alternative to replace the International Space Station (ISS) by the end of the decade.

The US-led venture with footing in Germany, where a number of Airbus Defence and Space sites are located, will ""reliably meet the known demand from global space agencies while opening new opportunities for commercial users,"" Matthew Kuta, president of Voyager Space, said in a statement.

In replacing the ISS, NASA plans to purchase services rather than manage programs itself, as it already does with sending astronauts into space.

Voyager won a $160 million contract from NASA at the end of 2021 to develop Starlab.

NASA has also awarded $130 million to Blue Origin, founded by Jeff Bezos, and $126 million to the giant Northrop Grumman to develop their own space station projects.

US-firm Axiom Space is also developing a station with support from NASA and the Franco-Italian firm Thales Alenia Space.

Starlab's inclusion of Airbus, which began providing technical support in January, will allow Voyager Space to offer services to the European Space Agency (ESA), receive its astronauts and provide industrial returns to Europe.

""We feel we are the representative or maybe the spearhead of Europe in this. And of course we're doing this also to pull ESA and member states along,"" Michael Schoellhorn, president of Airbus Defence and Space, told journalists during a conference call.

The European group can draw on its expertise in developing automatic transfer vehicles (ATV) and the European Service Modules designed for the US lunar mission Artemis, he said.

Neither Schoellhorn nor Voyager Space CEO Dylan Taylor would specify their exact stake in the project.

Starlab is slated to be launched into orbit in 2028. Its diameter of eight meters will be almost twice that of the ISS, although its volume will be about half as the ISS has several modules, according to Taylor.

""NASA and other space agencies will be the core of our business for the first Starlab,"" Taylor said.

The station will be dedicated to research and work in microgravity that is important for the pharmaceutical industry, but ""we're not targeting space tourism"", he added.

Voyager and Airbus will operate Starlab private space station via ‘transatlantic joint venture’ - TechCrunch,"Wed, 02 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3RlY2hjcnVuY2guY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvMDIvdm95YWdlci1hbmQtYWlyYnVzLXdpbGwtb3BlcmF0ZS1zdGFybGFiLXByaXZhdGUtc3BhY2Utc3RhdGlvbi12aWEtdHJhbnNhdGxhbnRpYy1qb2ludC12ZW50dXJlL9IBhAFodHRwczovL3RlY2hjcnVuY2guY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvMDIvdm95YWdlci1hbmQtYWlyYnVzLXdpbGwtb3BlcmF0ZS1zdGFybGFiLXByaXZhdGUtc3BhY2Utc3RhdGlvbi12aWEtdHJhbnNhdGxhbnRpYy1qb2ludC12ZW50dXJlL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Voyager Space and Airbus Defence and Space are expanding their existing relationship via a new joint venture focused on the design, build and operation of the Starlab commercial space station.

The two companies announced they will be partnering on Voyager’s Starlab space station in January, saying that Airbus would provide “technical design support and expertise,” but little else was disclosed at the time. Today’s news marks a considerable uptick in commitment from Airbus, and a signal that both companies are looking to attract European government partnerships.

A representative for the firms declined to comment on the percentage of ownership between Voyager and Airbus.

The transatlantic JV will be a U.S.-based entity, but it will have a European subsidiary “to directly serve the European Space Agency (ESA) and its member state space agencies,” the companies said in a statement.

Denver-based Voyager Space first revealed its ambitions to operate a commercial space station in October 2021, with a consortium made up of it, Lockheed Martin and Voyager subsidiary Nanoracks. The companies are planning to commence operations in 2028, a full three years before the planned decommissioning of the International Space Station (ISS).

Indeed, NASA is happy for private industry to take the lead on developing and operating the station (or stations) that will replace the ISS; in December 2021, the space agency awarded more than $400 million in agreements to three major private space station projects: Voyager’s plans got $160 million, while Blue Origin’s Orbital Reef received $130 million and Northrop Grumman’s project got $125.6 million.

Of course, once the ISS is decommissioned, NASA is not the only space agency that will be affected. All of the international partners that use the ISS will also be looking for a new home for research in space, but come 2030, they’ll have to deal with private companies when looking to book space, not NASA. More direct involvement by a Europe-based company in a station’s operations could make the entire project more amenable to European governments and taxpayers.

“The International Space Station is widely regarded as the most successful platform for global cooperation in space history, and we are committed to building on this legacy as we move forward with Starlab,” Voyager president Matthew Kuta said in a statement.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998589754104614}",neutral,0.9998589754104614,0

Wizz Air is the largest client for the Airbus A321neo.

Hungarian low-cost airline Wizz Air has ordered another 75 A321neo aircraft, Airbus said Wednesday, in a deal worth $10 billion at list prices.

Wizz Air was already the largest client for the largest version of the Airbus' best-selling model, and takes its total of the single-aisle, medium-haul aircraft to 434.

The airline already has 180 A320 family aircraft in operation, with more than half of them neo versions equipped with more fuel-efficient engines.

""The A321neo's unparalleled economic efficiency and remarkably low carbon footprint underpin our commitment to provide affordable and sustainable travel options for our customers,"" Wizz Air chief executive Jozsef Varadi was quoted as saying in an Airbus statement.

The A321neos ordered by Wizz Air will have 240 seats in a single class.

Created 20 years ago, Wizz Air is Europe's sixth-largest airline in terms of daily flights.

The airline's board chairman is William Franke, who is the managing partner of Indigo Partners, a US private equity firm which holds stakes in a number of carriers including Frontier Airlines in the United States, JetSMART in Chile, and Volaris in Mexico as well as Wizz Air.

This comes after Airbus joined Voyager’s Starlab development team earlier this year.

The companies are pitching the joint venture as a commercial successor for the International Space Station, with U.S. and European collaboration. Starlab will have a European joint venture subsidiary.

“We are proud to charter the future of space stations with Airbus,” Matthew Kuta, president of Voyager Space, commented. “The International Space Station is widely regarded as the most successful platform for global cooperation in space history, and we are committed to building on this legacy as we move forward with Starlab.

Starlab is planned as a free-flying space station to support NASA, global space agencies, and researchers, targeted for launch in 2028. Starlab recently completed a system requirements review (SRR) to evaluate functional, technical, performance, and security requirements with NASA.

Starlab is partially funded by NASA with $160 million in a Space Act Agreement awarded in 2021 to Voyager subsidiary Nanoracks. NASA awarded contracts as part of its commercial Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) development program to transition from the ISS future commercial space stations. Lockheed Martin is also a part of the project, serving as the manufacturer and technical integrator.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9635691046714783}",positive,0.9635691046714783,1

El Al Israel Airlines is reportedly in talks with European manufacturer Airbus to acquire some A321neos to add to its fleet, in what would be a sharp change of strategy for the longtime Boeing customer.

Since the airline was founded in 1948, the same year Israel became a nation, El Al has maintained an all-Boeing fleet due to the country’s close ties with the United States, where Boeing is headquartered. An order for Airbus aircraft would be a significant change in policy.

Dina Ben Tal Ganancia, CEO of the Israeli flag carrier, told Reuters about her plans on Thursday, adding that the airline is also speaking with Boeing about ordering 737 Max jets.

Ben Tal Ganancia said the final decision would likely be made early next year. She said the talks were “serious.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999619722366333}",neutral,0.999619722366333,0

“The A320neo’s performance and efficiency will allow JetSMART to augment its route offering and power its continuous growth in South America,” said Arturo Barreira, President of Airbus Latin America and the Caribbean.

“Airbus’ manufacturing center in Mobile continues to achieve impressive new milestones, and it’s exciting to see JetSMART take delivery of a ‘Made in Alabama’ passenger jet that’s bound for South American skies,” Alabama Governor Kay Ivey said. “This moment is a powerful reminder that Alabama workers turn out world-class products in demand all over the world.”

“With this international delivery, we can celebrate another special occasion for Airbus and its talented Alabama workforce,” said Greg Canfield, Secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce. “Since Airbus broke ground on its aircraft production facility in Mobile in 2013, its Alabama operation has been in constant growth mode, making memorable days like today not only possible but frequent.”

JetSMART is an all-Airbus ULCC developed by Indigo Partners. Today, it operates 25 A320 family aircraft, including nine A320neo and five A321neo. In 2017, JetSMART signed a purchase agreement for 70 A320neo and 6 A320ceo aircraft. It received its first A320neo in October 2019 and formalized an order for 12 A321XLRs that same year. In 2021, JetSMART announced an additional order for 23 additional NEO aircraft.

In 2015, Mobile, Alabama became home to Airbus’ first U.S.-based commercial aircraft manufacturing facility. From an initial workforce of around 250 producing A320 Family aircraft, today the facility employs more than 1,600 people and produces both A320 and A220 Family aircraft. To date, more than 400 aircraft have been delivered to 14 customers.

“This transatlantic venture ... aligns the interests of [Airbus] and Voyager and our respective space agencies,” Jean-Marc Nasr, head of Space Systems at Airbus, said in a statement.

The joint venture, announced on Aug. 2, builds on an earlier agreement between Airbus and Voyager Space for Airbus to provide technical design support and expertise for Starlab.

The agreement is subject to applicable regulatory approvals.

The Voyager Space-owned Nanoracks won a $160 million Space Act Agreement (SAA) from NASA in December 2021, setting the stage for the creation of Starlab—a continuously crewed, free-flying space station in LEO designed to serve NASA and other agencies, as well as businesses and researchers.

NASA is also working with Blue Origin, Northrop Grumman and Axiom Space to develop free-flying commercial space stations that the agency can transition to as the International Space Station (ISS) program comes to an end.

Airbus currently operates the Bartolomeo payload-hosting platform aboard the ISS.

The joint venture with Airbus gives the European Space Agency (ESA) and its member state space agencies a direct route to procure Starlab services, Voyager Space added.

In June, the Starlab program completed a System Requirements Review, which baselines major space systems, technical readiness and the ability to meet NASA’s mission and safety requirements.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999490976333618}",neutral,0.9999490976333618,0

DALLAS – The national airline of Papua New Guinea, Air Niugini (PX), has announced that it has chosen the Airbus A220 to replace its ageing Fokker fleet.

PX will acquire eleven A220s, including the -100 and larger -300 series jets, in a deal announced on the carrier’s Facebook page. The deal is worth over PGK22.5bn (US$6.2bn). The Airbus aircraft’s arrival, scheduled for the first quarter of 2025, will see the retirement of the four Fokker 100s and four Fokker 70s.

Speaking of the order, PX’s acting CEO Mr Gary Seddon said, “It’s a momentous day in Air Niugini’s history. This is the first time for ANG to purchase brand new regional jets. We are moving from analogue to digital. The Fokker jet aircraft have done their part for the last 25 years and it’s time to replace them with a game changer aircraft.”

Fleet Renewal

The move forms part of a wider fleet renewal. Earlier this year, the airline announced it would acquire a pair of Boeing 787-8s to replace its Boeing 767-300ERs. The Dreamliners are due to arrive in March and April 2026. The regional fleet replacement was between the Airbus A220 and Embraer E195-E2, and the choice of the former marks another commitment for the type in the Asia-Pacific region after Qantas (QF) ordered the jet in 2022.

Minister for State Enterprises, Hon William Duma, added, “The Airbus A220 can operate both domestic and international routes with more capacity. It burns 27 per cent less fuel than the current fleet for the same sectors and has greater comfort and operating efficiency.

“This remarkable aircraft stands as the epitome of modern airliners in its category, specifically tailored for the 100-150 seat segment. It boasts an impressive range of up to 6,400 kilometres, together with spacious cabin, seats and windows, passengers can enjoy high level of comfort during the flight.”

Air Niugini also has three Boeing 737-800s and six De Havilland Canada Dash 8-400s on order.

It is among several private space station concepts designed to replace the International Space Station (ISS), which is scheduled to shut down in 2030.

Starlab was one of three concepts selected by NASA for funding in 2021. It received $160 million from the space agency for design and development. NASA also has agreements with Blue Origin, Northrop Grumman, and Axiom. The grants represent a cost-sharing, public-private partnership arrangement that seems to be the model for launching private commercial space ventures. Last week’s news marks a transition from Airbus’s role as technical consultant to Starlab’s co-owner. Other partners include Hilton and Nanoracks, another Voyager Space company.

“We are establishing this joint venture to reliably meet the known demand from global space agencies while opening new opportunities for commercial users,” Voyager Space President Matthew Kuta said in a statement.

Voyager Space has completed the Starlab Systems Requirements Review (SRR), according to Kuta, which covers “the major space systems, technical readiness, and ability to meet NASA’s mission and safety requirements,” in coordination with NASA’s Commercial LEO Development Program team. Voyager’s goal is to launch Starlab in 2028 “to ensure a continued human presence in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO).”

NASA wants to have at least one commercial space station in flight before the ISS is retired. The U.S. space agency says this will let it focus on deep-space exploration, lunar flights, and human missions to Mars.

Axiom Space, partnering with SpaceX and NASA, plans to attach modules to the ISS and then the modules will later be detached to become an independent station. Boeing, Blue Origin, Sierra Space, and Redwire have announced plans to build the Orbital Reef space station by 2030.

Northrop Grumman also has a space station in the works, using the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO) module it is building for the Lunar Gateway space station. The new station has yet to be named. Airbus also announced a space-station concept earlier this year called the Loop, though it’s not clear if that will be abandoned now that it is partnering in Starlab.

In May, California start-up Vast Space said it plans to launch the first module of what will be a space station. It forecasts 2025 for the launch of the station atop Space X’s Falcon Heavy rocket, with a 30-day orbital mission that includes private astronauts happening soon after. If successful, Vast Space would have the first private commercial space station.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999868869781494}",neutral,0.9999868869781494,0

Malaysian cargo airline Raya leases ATSG’s 1st Airbus freighters - FreightWaves,"Wed, 16 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWlnaHR3YXZlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9tYWxheXNpYW4tY2FyZ28tYWlybGluZS1yYXlhLWxlYXNlcy1hdHNncy0xc3QtYWlyYnVzLWZyZWlnaHRlcnPSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVpZ2h0d2F2ZXMuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWFuLWNhcmdvLWFpcmxpbmUtcmF5YS1sZWFzZXMtYXRzZ3MtMXN0LWFpcmJ1cy1mcmVpZ2h0ZXJzL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Transport Services Group, a diversified lessor and operator of cargo aircraft, has rented out its first Airbus freighters to an airline in Malaysia and is raising debt to help fund more aircraft investment and buy back shares from Amazon even as it slows capital expenditures to please investors.

The Ohio-based company on Monday announced that it delivered a record six converted freighters under lease in one month to customers around the world in July, including its first two Airbus A321 converted freighter aircraft to Raya Airways, a scheduled all-cargo carrier based in Kuala Lumpur. All the leases are for seven years.

The Airbus aircraft were retrofitted by 321 Precision Conversions, a joint venture between ATSG and an overhaul specialist that designs and markets conversion kits. Two authorized specialty shops in Florida, one of which is an ATSG subsidiary, installed the conversions.

Raya has seven other aircraft in its fleet, including three midsize Boeing 767-200 converted freighters from ATSG and one A321 converted freighter that arrived in May after being converted by an Airbus-affiliated aerospace engineering firm. Last year the airline added more flights to Nanning, China; Singapore; Jakarta, Indonesia; and Vietnam to meet demand for e-commerce and time-definite delivery in Southeast Asia.

Meanwhile, Georgian Airlines, Cargojet in Canada, Miami-based Amerijet International and SkyTaxi in Poland each received one 767-300 freighter. Georgian Airlines, headquartered in Tibilisi, is a new customer. Cargojet, which reported second-quarter earnings on Monday and said it has reduced flight activity because of lower express volumes, now has four 767s from ATSG. Amerijet leases a total of 10 767-300s, while SkyTaxi also flies two 767-200s from ATSG.

The new leases underscore ATSG’s growing customer base in global markets, where demand for freighters remains strong to support express delivery of e-commerce shipments. E-commerce is growing faster in many regions of the world than in established economies like the United States, and consumers are ordering goods that require more cross-border transportation.

“The assets that we deploy are targeted to these global e-commerce markets and integrated networks. And you’re seeing that these networks are projecting double-digit growth outside the United States,” said Chief Commercial Officer Paul Chase in an Aug. 4 earnings call with analysts. “When you look at our [new] freighter deployments, roughly 80% of those aircraft are going outside the United States.”

A deal with Vietnam Airlines appears to have fallen through. Two sources outside ATSG say Vietnam Airlines no longer intends to sign a sale-leaseback agreement with ATSG for two of its A321 jets to serve as the foundation for a new freighter division. The Asia cargo market has weakened considerably since last summer, prompting a wealthy investor in November to scuttle plans for Vietnam’s first all-cargo airline. Last August, Chief Strategy Officer Mike Berger told investors that the converted planes could be delivered this year, but the company has not mentioned Vietnam Airlines in any earnings presentations since then and another company official declined to comment about customer discussions outside of public disclosure periods.





ATSG (NASDAQ: ATSG) for decades has built its business around used 767s converted from passenger configuration for carrying heavy containers. The process involves teardown of the passenger compartment and installation of new features, such as a wide cargo door, heavy-duty floor beams and a loading system.

Several years ago, the holding company took a 49% stake in 321 Precision Conversions to tap into the narrowbody freighter market with an Airbus product that competes with conversions of the standard-size Boeing 737-800. And in 2021, it announced plans to procure Airbus A330 passenger jets and convert them into freighters in an effort to reach more international customers that favor Airbus and reduce supply risk as the available pool of 767s shrinks and conversion houses face lengthy production backlogs.

During the quarterly briefing, management said it expects to deliver three more A321 converted freighters this year and in October send the first A330 to Airbus’ Elbe Flugzeugwerke for cargo overhaul. In total, ATSG plans to lease a record 19 aircraft this year, including 14 B767-300s, including four 767-300s that were placed with customers in July for seven years. Three A330s are being acquired this year for lease to customers in 2024. The plan is to have a fleet of 119 freighters in the fleet by year-end, up from 113 today.

That type of investment takes money.

ATSG said it heard the message last spring from investors concerned about the level of planned capital expenditures during a prolonged airfreight recession, and is dialing back projected spending by $65 million, from $850 million to $785 million in 2023. A third of the amount is for heavy maintenance and the rest for fleet growth. The decrease resulted from postponing purchases of two A321 aircraft for lease in 2024 and fewer planned overhauls of engines for aging 767-200s, six of which have been removed from the fleet and will be stripped for usable parts and engines.

Company officials say they will time future investments in new aircraft closer to when production slots for conversions open up, which should increase liquidity without impacting planned delivery schedules. But they aren’t retreating from their investment strategy despite the current freight transport recession, pointing to e-commerce growth and increasing need for replacements as a large tranche of aging cargo jets start being deactivated.

Last Wednesday, ATSG announced plans to sell $350 million in senior debt that gives investors the option of converting notes into shares of the company. Analysts say they expect the offering to be upsized to $400 million. About half of the money will go to pay off an existing convertible bond due for repayment in 2024 and $118 million will be used to buy back 5.4 million shares, including 1.17 million owned by Amazon – its largest customer. That leaves up to $80 million in debt left over for capital expenditures. The company indicated it will pay down loans from its credit line and then borrow again when it’s time to buy more planes and conversion jobs.

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) owns nearly 20% of ATSG and has warrants allowing it to increase its holding to 40% but appears to be deliberately trying to stay below the 20% ownership threshold for some unknown regulatory reason, said Stifel equity analyst Frank Galanti in a client note.





As ATSG goes through its growth phase and starts receiving lease revenue from new aircraft, it will have plenty of free cash flow to use for reducing debt, management says.

Positive leasing, airline results

Analysts gave ATSG good grades for its second-quarter performance considering the prolonged downturn in air shipping that has seen global rates tumble 40% to 50% year over year. Revenue increased 4% to $393.4 million (reported as CA$529 million) year over year thanks to a rebound in passenger charter business, 13 more 767-300 freighters deployed to customers, and annual price escalators kicking in for Amazon and DHL Express contracts. Adjusted earnings before tax and accounting measures of $116.7 million were comparable to the prior year and better than in the first quarter.

ATSG’s stock is up more than 12% to $22.59 per share since releasing earnings on Aug. 3.

Leasing subsidiary Cargo Aircraft Management posted a 2% gain in revenue because of higher lease rates and more 767-300s under contract, offset by the scheduled return of 10 767-200s since last summer, including seven in the second quarter. Most of the 767-200s are coming off expiring leases with Amazon’s in-house airline, which relinquished four during the quarter and could return up to eight aircraft this year. Amazon has a new contract with Hawaiian Airlines to fly 10 Airbus A330-300 converted freighters, the first of which is scheduled to enter service in October, and has said the planes are for replacing aging 767-200s.

CEO Rich Corrado said the company’s cargo airlines will operate seven 767-200s for Amazon at least through the peak holiday season. ATSG flies a total of 47 aircraft for Amazon — 38 leased from ATSG and nine provided by Amazon.

Six of the eight airframes returned in the first half have been removed from service. Their parts and engines will be used to support the existing fleet or possibly sold. Overall, ATSG had a net gain of four aircraft on lease over the past year.

Revenue flight hours ticked up 1% at cargo airlines ABX Air and Air Transport International, which operated three more freighters than in the prior-year period. Flight hours were impacted by certain customers ending contracts for bundled aircraft and transportation service between the U.S. and Europe.

The amount of flight activity compares favorably with competitors, many of which are cutting back operations to better match the prolonged decline in e-commerce and general shipping demand. Canadian carrier Cargojet, which operates a domestic overnight network for Amazon and other express delivery companies, said on Monday that billable flight hours decreased 5.9% during the second quarter as it consolidated some flights to increase efficiency.

ATSG benefited from being a major operator for Amazon Air, which has slowed the pace of expansion but continued to add flights this year while DHL, FedEx and UPS have reduced the number of flights and temporarily parked some aircraft. Amazon Air’s flight utilization actually is up 16% year over year through July, according to Morgan Stanley transportation analyst Ravi Shanker, who tracks the parcel carriers. Domestic flight hours at FedEx and UPS are down 14% and 13% year over year.

Amazon’s North American retail sales increased 11% year over year during the second quarter, and the retailer generated record sales for Prime Day last month, which normally serves as a springboard for a strong peak shipping season for upcoming shopping events and holidays.

Amazon CEO Andrew Jassey said on a call with analysts that customers are interested in faster delivery, which favors providers like ATSG.

“We’ve been encouraged by the block hours that we’re going to be doing in the fourth quarter. It’s really going to be flat over last year, but when you compare that to what’s going on in the general cargo market, which has been fairly weak, we look to be holding our own,” said Corrado during an earnings briefing for analysts. “Our ACMI (bundled lease with aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance) operations on the cargo side are targeted at specific network flying that’s geared towards e-commerce and integrated packages, and that has reacted differently to the downturn than general air cargo.”

The federal government is mediating stalled contract talks between subsidiary Air Transport International and its pilots’ union. Talks have broken down over work rules, retirement and compensation. The Air Line Pilots Association said members have not seen any raises since March 2021 while inflation erodes paychecks and claims 152 pilots, representing 28% of the workforce, have left for greener pastures as other passenger and cargo airlines implement new contracts with standard-setting pay rates and retirement packages.

“Our goal always is to get the right contract where we can attract and retain the pilots that we have, and then also have the cost structure from which we’re able to compete for business,” Corrado said, adding he doesn’t expect a settlement before next year.

FAA posts directive for fixes to Pratt's Airbus A320 engines - American Journal of Transportation,"Fri, 18 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFqb3QuY29tL25ld3MvZmFhLXBvc3RzLWRpcmVjdGl2ZS1mb3ItZml4ZXMtdG8tcHJhdHRhcy1haXJidXMtYTMyMC1lbmdpbmVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By: Ryan Beene and Alan Levin | Aug 18 2023 at 12:43 PM | Air Cargo

US aviation regulators outlined inspections needed for potentially faulty parts on some of Pratt & Whitney’s geared turbofan engines that power Airbus SE’s best-selling A320neo model.

The directive affects 20 engines on US-registered aircraft, according to a regulatory filing by the Federal Aviation Administration on Friday. The impact on the worldwide fleet will be larger as other nations adopt the FAA’s requirements.

Pratt, a unit of aerospace giant RTX Corp., said in July that 1,200 GTF engines must be removed and inspected over the next 12 months after the company discovered contamination in the powdered metal used to manufacture high-pressure turbine discs could shorten their life span. The company has said that the first 200 turbines will need accelerated removals by mid-September.

Inspections of first- and second-stage high-pressure turbine discs will cost $8,500 each, according to the FAA’s airworthiness directive. Replacing any faulty discs will cost operators about $171,000 apiece.

The costs could be substantial. Based on the FAA estimates, the total cost across the global fleet could exceed $400 million if all 1,200 engines that need inspection were found to have flawed first and second-stage discs. The FAA cautioned that it could not determine how many will actually need replacement.

RTX executives have previously said that more than 3,000 earlier inspections tied to the potential flaw found that fewer than 1% needed replacements.

The July announcement marked the latest stumble for RTX’s marquee commercial aircraft engine, which was already causing headaches for airlines around the globe over durability challenges and lengthy waits — often several months long — for repairs to be completed.

The GTF is one of two power plants available on the A320neo, the world’s best-selling jet. Airlines have been vocal about the disruption that the removal of engines will cause on their workhorse fleet, with European discount carrier Wizz Air Holdings Plc scaling back growth plans while US carriers Spirit Airlines and JetBlue said they will idle more of their fleet.

Also included in the filing were inspections for a version of the GTF engine that powers Russia’s in-development MC-21 jet. The country has said it was developing alternative turbines for the model after sanctions were imposed due to its invasion of Ukraine.

RTX, formerly known as Raytheon Technologies, last month cut its 2023 free cash flow forecast by $500 million over the flaw, though it wasn’t yet able to estimate the full financial impact from the issue.

The FAA directive follows an earlier service bulletin from the company notifying airlines that will be impacted by the first lot of engines that need immediate checks. While the FAA has no authority over aircraft registered outside the US, other aviation authorities typically mandate the same procedures.

RTX is expected to shoulder much of the financial impact of the issue. Chief Executive Officer Greg Hayes said last month that the company would compensate their affected customers for the issue.

"Acro rated Premium Supplier by Airbus for design, manufacturing chops - Runway Girl Network","Fri, 04 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvYWNyby1haXJidXMtZGVzaWduLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Known for designing innovative, lightweight aircraft seats that create space for passengers’ knees and shins even in high-density layouts, Acro Aircraft Seating’s platforms have long been linefit offerable as buyer furnished equipment (BFE) on the Airbus A320 family. Now Airbus has recognized Acro as a ‘Premium Supplier’ for economy class and premium economy class seats in its latest BFE catalogue, which guides customers during their equipment selection process.

Seen as an influential independent endorsement of Acro’s focus on quality and execution across the design and manufacturing processes, the Airbus rating is reviewed every six months and based on three criteria: delivery performance, quality performance, and technical performance.

In the context of industry’s broader supply chain constraints, Acro’s Premium Supplier rating from Airbus last month is certainly noteworthy. Now consider the fact that several Acro seats are offerable in the A320 family BFE catalogue and the Crick, UK-headquartered seatmaker’s achievement takes on new significance.

For economy class, Acro’s Series 3, Series 6FB (fixed back), Series 6R (recline), plus its new Series 9FB and Series 9R seats are part of the catalogue. So too is its Series 7 recliner for domestic business or international premium economy class, Acro technical director Andy Jones confirms to Runway Girl Network.

Indeed, the company’s launch programme for the popular Series 6 line was an Airbus linefit programme for Air New Zealand. “Since then, we have delivered multiple linefit programmes for multiple airlines including Flyadeal, EnterAir, Titan, Qingdao to name just a few,” he says.

Jones also reveals that Acro has “some exciting new product developments” forthcoming for its BFE offerable Series 7. So, stay tuned.

“As ‘Premium Supplier’ indicates, we’re not only setting the bar high on innovative design, we are also delivering on the essential practicalities which make our products very robust and reliable in operation,” says company CEO Neil Cairns in a statement.

“Across the entire journey from design to delivery, we have positioned ourselves as a high performing and trusted supplier. Our superb economy and premium class seating is thoughtfully conceived, making it lighter and more sustainable than ever before, whilst ensuring outstanding value for our customers: a key priority in a challenging marketplace.”

On the sustainability front, Acro doesn’t just talk the talk, it walks the walk. With a keen focus on reducing both its own carbon footprint and those of its products, the seatmaker’s newest Series 9 is billed as being “a 98.83% recyclable structure”. But how is this accomplished?

Jones explains:

The entire Bill of Materials (BoM) was analysed down to individual component level by the experts at AIRA (Aircraft Interior Recycling Association), using their comprehensive materials database. The database is constantly evolving, and contains details of proven recycling techniques for a wide range of materials. They assessed each and every component for its material content, and specifically its suitability to be recycled. Among others, the multiple types of plastic, high grade aluminium alloys and carbon fibre were all identified as recyclable, with clear strategies defined on how this can be done in practice. A very small number of parts were identified as non-recyclable and, informed by AIRA’s analysis, we’re already working on solutions to improve the recyclable content beyond the 98.8% already achieved.

The partnership with AIRA provides a clear direction of each component element that can be recycled, with Jones further explaining that: “AIRA’s database assigns a Recycling Identification Number to every material type, and as a result of the BoM analysis each component part can be assigned the corresponding Identification Number.

“Airlines are able to access this information in order to identify the appropriate end-of-life action for each component. With the high percentage of recyclable parts on Series 9, these can be disposed of through recycling rather than simply sending them to landfill, as is so common historically.”

He reveals that Acro is now developing ideas around how to provide its development teams with this kind of information early in the design process, so that material selections can be made with a full understanding of end of life recyclability.

Though the Premium Supplier rating from Airbus doesn’t explicitly rate sustainability performance, the important work being undertaken by Acro certainly positions it for any such eventuality.

Fiji Airways Plans Network Expansion with Arrival of Third Airbus A350 – Airways - Airways Magazine,"Wed, 16 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vZmlqaS1haXJ3YXlzLXRoaXJkLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Fiji Airways Plans Network Expansion with Arrival of Third Airbus A350

DALLAS – Fiji Airways (FJ) has welcomed its third Airbus A350 as the carrier continues to modernize its fleet.

The aircraft, a -900 series (DQ-FAM), christened ‘Island of Beqa’ was welcomed at the airline’s Nadi Airport (NAN) hub on Tuesday, August 15, with a traditional water cannon salute. Fijian Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka was also in attendance, along with various dignitaries.

Pride of the Fleet

At the event, Andre Viljoen, Fiji Airways CEO, said that the A350 “has fast become the pride of our airline and the joy of our passengers.” Two other aircraft joined the fleet in November and December 2019; a fourth is due later this year. They are configured with 334 seats in a two-class layout, 33 in business and 301 in economy.

The state-of-the-art aircraft will be pivotal in the airline’s expansion plans. “Fiji Airways brings in 70 per cent of all visitors to Fiji. We are crucial to the long-term sustainable growth of the tourism industry, which is 45 per cent of our Gross Domestic Product and the largest employer in the country,” Viljoen explained.

“As the National Airline we recognize our role is not just to be the bridge to and from the world but to support the growth of tourism, one of the ways we can do this is by introducing new destinations with potential for high tourism opportunities.”

The A350 joins the carriers Airbus A330s such as DQ-FJU, an Airbus A330-243 pictured here. Photo: Luca Flores/Airways.

Expansion Plans

Indeed, the airline is now looking at new destinations which the A350 could open up that are beyond FJ’s current network, “for example, the A350 XWBs are capable of flying much deeper into the United States or Canada.”

Some North American destinations that are being studied include Dallas and Seattle. Meanwhile, the carrier is also looking at Seoul, South Korea, plus Shanghai and Beijing in China. These would complement the carrier’s current service to Hong Kong.

For now, FJ will use the new addition to add capacity on its primary markets of Australia and New Zealand, as well as flights to Hong Kong, San Francisco and Vancouver.

According to the companies, the U.S.-led project “will bring together world-class leaders in the space domain, while further uniting American and European interests in space exploration.” Called Starlab, it is intended to succeed the International Space Station (ISS).

“The International Space Station is widely regarded as the most successful platform for global cooperation in space history, and we are committed to building on this legacy as we move forward with Starlab,” said Voyager Space President Matthew Kuta. “We are establishing this joint venture to reliably meet the known demand from global space agencies while opening new opportunities for commercial users.”

The joint venture will build on an earlier agreement between the companies for Airbus to provide technical design support and expertise for Starlab. Voyager noted that it completed the Starlab Systems Requirements Review (SRR), which covers “the major space systems, technical readiness, and ability to meet NASA’s mission and safety requirements,” in coordination with NASA’s Commercial LEO Development Program team in June. Voyager has previously stated that the goal is to launch Starlab in 2028 “to ensure a continued human presence in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO).” ISS operations are currently scheduled to end in 2030.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6485824584960938}",neutral,0.6485824584960938,0

Hydrogen-powered planes almost ready for takeoff - Ars Technica,"Wed, 09 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vYXJzdGVjaG5pY2EuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvMjAyMy8wOC9oeWRyb2dlbi1wb3dlcmVkLXBsYW5lcy1hbG1vc3QtcmVhZHktZm9yLXRha2VvZmYv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A complete hydrogen fuel cell powertrain assembly occupied the pride of place in the pavilion of Beyond Aero at the recently concluded Paris Air Show. That a fuel cell system was the Toulouse-based startup’s centerpiece at the biennial aero event is an indication of the steps being taken by a range of companies, from startups to multinational corporations, toward realizing the goal of using hydrogen as fuel in the aviation sector.

“This 85 kilowatt subscale demonstrator was successfully tested a few months ago. Even though in its current form, it serves only ultralight aviation, the successful test of the powertrain is a crucial step in our technical development path for designing and building a business aircraft,” Beyond Aero co-founder Hugo Tarlé told Ars Technica.

Tarlé said that the business aircraft would have a range of 800 nautical miles and will be powered by a 1 MW powertrain. “For generating this power, there won’t be one big megawatt fuel cell. Instead, it will be multiple fuel cells. It will be based on the same technical choices that we made on the subscale demonstrator—i.e. gaseous hydrogen, fuel cell, hybridization of batteries and electric motors.""

Beyond Aero stays small

Tarlé listed the reasons behind developing a CS23 category aircraft using hydrogen. “The CS23 is a EASA (European Union Aviation Safety Agency) certification for small aircraft with a low Maximum Take-off Weight. The requirements for this certification are lower than for CS25 certification (larger aircraft). So it's more realistic for a start-up.”

In the case of Beyond Aero, their first aircraft will have a Maximum Take-off Weight of under 8.5 tonnes with a seating capacity between 4 and 8.

“With hydrogen fuel cell technology we could reach a certain performance in terms of the range of our aircraft. We realized that with a range of 800 nautical miles, we could cover 80 percent of the business aircraft market.” He said electric batteries alone were not considered, as they are too heavy for aircraft.

“Batteries alone are not an option, due to their low mass-energy density. With batteries alone, the range of the aircraft is very low. However, there will be hybridization of the fuel cell with batteries for phases where extra power is required, such as during take offs. ”

Tarlé also stressed there is an urgent need to decarbonize business aircraft because of its CO 2 emissions. “The CO 2] emissions per passenger in a business aircraft is 10 times more than an airliner passenger,” he said.

Another important factor for choosing a relatively smaller sized aircraft was the certification process. “As a young startup, it’s more realistic to aim for a CS 23 category certification than a certification for an airliner,” Tarlé said.

Speaking about the design challenges, Tarlé said mastering the characteristics of hydrogen and oxygen inside the fuel cell was a critical task. “For achieving the best efficiency of the fuel cell, we are considering several factors such as using a compressor, an intercooler and filter, as well as changing the characteristic[s] of hydrogen (for example, increasing its temperature) before it reaches the anode of the fuel cell,” he said.

The other challenge, according to Tarlé, was related to the cooling system. “We need to evacuate a lot of thermal energy, which adds plenty of weight. Mastering the complexity of the cooling system is therefore critical,” he said, adding Beyond Aero has patented a solution in this regard.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9984402060508728}",neutral,0.9984402060508728,0

The CFM-56 powered jet registered C-GLJH, is just over 15 years old and previously operated with Virgin America (VX) before joining Alaska Airlines (AS) following its acquisition of VX in 2018.

Canada Jetlines commenced operations in September 2022, flying between YYZ and Calgary (YYC), a route that has since been terminated. Cautious expansion has been the name of the game for the Canadian new entrant, with scheduled services offered between YYZ, Cancun (CUN) and Las Vegas (LAS).

It has also expanded into the charter flying business and recently signed a six-month deal with Suriname-based Fly AllWays (8W) to provide weekly flights from YYZ to Cheddi Jagan International Airport (GEO) in Georgetown, Guyana. Since the beginning of 2023, AU has operated some 340 charter and ACMI flights and plans to operate more this year. To support this expansion, the carrier has also revealed that by 2025 it plans to expand its fleet to 15 Airbus A320s.

CEO Comments

“Canada Jetlines is executing on its previously-announced fleet growth plan with the addition of its third aircraft,” stated Canada Jetlines CEO Eddy Doyle in a press release.

“The arrival during summer season is great timing to support our existing customers and continue the company’s growth plans as we look forward to our busy winter season. The expansion of Jetlines’ fleet will enable scheduled service expansion to new leisure destinations, fulfilling our commitment to customers and agency clients to becoming a premier choice of leisure airline.”

The airline’s insatiable appetite for new planes seems to be showing no signs of slowing down after the finance lease transaction was announced on August 23, 2023.

All ten Airbus A320neo aircraft are scheduled for delivery in 2023 and are all powered by CFM LEAP-1A engines.

“We are delighted to be embarking on another transaction with our long-time customer IndiGo, to enable the airline to expand its fleet with the latest technology aircraft,” Steven Townend, deputy managing director and CFO of BOC Aviation, said. “This showcases our ability to deploy alternative financing structures, to continue our long-term sustainable growth.”

Only one week ago there was speculation building that IndiGo is also poised to place an order for 25 new wide-body aircraft, with Boeing reportedly the frontrunner.

According to Reuters, sources familiar with the development have indicated that IndiGo is interested in purchasing Boeing 787 Dreamliner family aircraft.

It is clear though that through the new announcement with BOC Aviation that IndiGo is keen to boost the number of flights it operates as soon as possible.

“We are pleased to enhance our partnership with BOC Aviation with the lease agreement for these 10 aircraft,” said Riyaz Peer Mohamed, chief aircraft acquisition and financing officer at IndiGo, said. “This extended collaboration with BOC Aviation is part of our expansion strategy across domestic and international markets. India is currently among the fastest growing civil aviation markets in the world and these aircraft will help IndiGo consolidate its position in the region.”

IndiGo currently has over 300 aircraft and is operating well about 1,900 daily flights and connecting 79 domestic destinations and will soon further grow its footprint to 32 international destinations.

In June 2023, at a press conference at the Paris Air Show, IndiGo announced it had secured a substantial deal with Airbus for 500 aircraft.

When Airbus published its orders and deliveries for June 2023, it was revealed that the IndiGo order consisted of 125 A320neo and 375 A321neo aircraft.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9899560213088989}",neutral,0.9899560213088989,0

The European aerospace outfit is already a supplier to European Space Agency's ISS operations and built the Bartolomeo payload platform that eases the process of operating kit on the space station.

The aerospace outfit announced on Tuesday it's been asked to contribute ""technical design support and expertise"" to build an entire space station, in a joint venture with US outfit Voyager Space.

Voyager Space's subsidiary, Nanoracks, also operates kit on the ISS and even built one of its airlocks. Nanoracks has also won $160 million of US government funding to work on an ISS successor called Starlab.

""We are establishing this joint venture to reliably meet the known demand from global space agencies while opening new opportunities for commercial users,"" said Matthew Kuta, president at Voyager Space.

Note the mention of ""global"" space agencies – it's a nod to the fact that the JV means both NASA and the European Space Agency will have a local entity to talk with. And as the ESA already does business in space with Airbus, this looks like a way to ensure that Starlab can fly without encountering policy-driven turbulence caused by a need to work with local suppliers.

No wonder a canned quote from Airbus head of Space Systems Marc Nasr states ""This transatlantic venture with footprints on both sides of the ocean aligns the interests of both ourselves and Voyager and our respective space agencies.""

Starlab is billed as the ""first science park in space"" and capable of hosting four astronauts within its 340m3 interior. Another contributor to the project is Hilton – yes, the hotel chain – which is onboard to design pretty and welcoming interiors. Maybe some of those little soaps.

This vessel's design recently completed a Systems Requirements Review – an assessment of whether it meets NASA's mission and safety requirements.

Nanoracks expects to have a Starlab ready for human occupants in 2028 and expects it will attract commercial customers who need a presence in space for either experimental or other activities.

Just what Airbus's ""technical design support and expertise"" translates to in terms of a presence on Starlab hasn't been disclosed. Perhaps it's some space nous, plus lovely big overhead bins. ®","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999181032180786}",neutral,0.9999181032180786,0

The -200 was developed as a long-range variant of its predecessor, the -300, which first flew in November 1992. The aircraft, with a range of up to 7,250 nm (13,400 km), can carry 406 passengers in a single-class high-density configuration. The standard layout in three classes is typically between 210 and 250 passengers.

By the time of the maiden flight, Airbus had an order book of 49 firm orders plus 85 options for the -200. As of December 2020, Airbus had delivered over 600 examples.

Korean Air (KE) became the type’s launch customer when it received its first example (HL7539) in September 1998. The airline used the Pratt & Whitney PW4000 powered type to replace its aging Airbus A300-600Rs.

The jet comes with three engine types: the PW4000, the General Electric CF6-80E, and the Rolls-Royce Trent 700.

Freighter Variants

Airbus also developed a freighter version dubbed the A330-200F, which entered service with Etihad Airways (EY) in 2010. The all-cargo jet can carry between 65 and 70 tonnes of payload with a range of between 3,200 nm (5,900 km) and 4,000 nm (7,400 km).

In 2012 Airbus, together with ST Aerospace and Dresden-based Elbe Flugzeugwerke (EFW), launched the passenger-to-freighter (P2F) conversion program at the Singapore Air Show. Airbus delivered the first example to EgyptAir Cargo (MS) on August 3, 2018.

Aeroflot turns brakes off on some Airbus & Boeing aircraft - AeroTime,"Sun, 06 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvYWVyb2Zsb3QtaW5zdHJ1Y3RzLXBpbG90cy10by10dXJuLWJyYWtlcy1vZmYtb24tc29tZS1haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLWFpcmNyYWZ00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Russia’s national carrier, Aeroflot, is currently operating at least nine planes without brakes due to challenges in obtaining maintenance parts for foreign aircraft.

To cope with the issue of replacing worn-out brakes on Airbus and Boeing aircraft, Aeroflot has instructed its pilots to turn them off, as reported by Moscow Times. The airline has been flying at least nine such aircraft since the end of July 2023, including four Airbus aircraft (A320, A330, and two A321s) and five Boeing 777s.

Aeroflot has issued warnings to its pilots about the potential dangers of flying without brakes. The flight operations department of Aeroflot issued a memo to pilots, which was obtained and published by Aviatorschina. The memo states:

“The aircraft will tend to turn to the side where the brakes are not deactivated. Pay attention to this fact, especially when landing on a wet runway with a crosswind!!! There are restrictions on the width of the runway. The risk of overrunning the runway !!!”

According to the publication, airlines are permitted to operate aircraft with deactivated brakes for a maximum of ten days when the worn-out parts cannot be immediately replaced.

Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, sanctions imposed by Western countries have not only closed the airspaces of the United States, United Kingdom, and EU for Russian aircraft but have also prevented aviation companies from servicing the country’s aircraft or providing spare parts.

As a result, Aeroflot, whose fleet mostly consists of Western-made Airbus and Boeing jets, cannot directly access parts and spares from the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). According to ch-aviation.com data, the airline’s fleet comprises 295 aircraft, of which 217 (approximately 74%) are Airbus or Boeing.

To circumvent these restrictions, Aeroflot has reportedly begun sending its aircraft to Iran for maintenance. Iran, having been under heavy sanctions for several decades, is believed to have developed extensive knowledge in repairing aircraft under such circumstances.

Previous media reports have indicated a deteriorating safety situation at Aeroflot. For instance, one Russian investigative news publication claimed that the airline had instructed its staff to stop logging malfunctions on flights to prevent aircraft from being grounded, despite the necessity of fixing the issues.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5436183214187622}",neutral,0.5436183214187622,0

For pilot Markus Becker, the advantages are clear: “Thanks to the fifth rotor blade, the H145 is even more stable in the air, which means significantly less vibration for the interior — a brilliant difference,” Becker said in a translated statement.

Patients and crew also benefit from the higher payload of the new model. For example, more fuel can be absorbed, which means longer distances are possible in operations and emergencies.

Modernization of the fleet

The first H145 helicopter with a five-blade rotor was converted for station service at the DRF Luftrettung shipyard in December 2020. Since then, DRF Luftrettung has continuously added more H145s with five-blade rotors to its fleet. Mannheim is the 14th station to receive a machine of this type.

Mannheim station

The station was founded on July 1, 1986, and is located at Mannheim Airport. Christoph 53 is operational from sunrise (7 a.m. at the earliest) to sunset and is manned by a pilot, an emergency doctor and an emergency paramedic.

The Mannheim helicopter is an indispensable part of emergency rescue in the region around the industrially densely populated Rhine-Neckar conurbation with over two million inhabitants in the border triangle of Baden-Württemberg, Hesse and Rhineland-Palatinate.

In 2022, the Mannheim air rescue service was alerted to 1,118 missions.

Cathay Pacific Orders 32 More Airbus A321neo Aircraft - AeroXplorer,"Mon, 14 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vYWVyb3hwbG9yZXIuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2NhdGhheS1wYWNpZmljLW9yZGVycy0zMi1tb3JlLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIxbmVvLWFpcmNyYWZ0LnBocNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hong Kong's flag carrier Cathay Pacific has announced its intention to add up to 32 Airbus A321neo and A320neo aircraft to its fleet over the next six years. The airline is expanding and modernizing its fleet as part of its plans to turn Hong Kong into an international aviation hub. These aircraft are expected to be delivered by 2029 and will be used by Cathay Pacific and its low-cost subsidiary HK Express. This announcement means the Cathay Group will receive more than 70 additional aircraft in the coming years.

Ronald Lam, CEO of the Cathay Group, said: ""We are committed to investing in the long-term future of the Group and the Hong Kong international aviation hub, which is expected to grow exponentially with the operation of the Three-Runway system. These aircraft models have been serving Cathay Pacific and HK Express well, allowing us to strengthen the expansion of our Chinese Mainland and regional network for our customers.""

Lam added: ""As we strive towards achieving our vision of becoming one of the world's greatest service brands, we remain committed to continuously investing in our customer experience. These aircraft feature the latest technological enhancements to provide a quieter, more comfortable and more fuel-efficient journey for our customers.""

Cathay Pacific has already received 13 of the 32 A321neos it ordered in 2017. This announcement will add 32 more single-aisle Airbus aircraft to its fleet.

The Current Cathay Fleet

Currently, Cathay Pacific's Airbus fleet consists of 12 A321neos, 42 A330-300s, 29 A350-900s, and 18 A350-1000s. The carrier's Boeing fleet has 17 777-300s and 39 777-300ERs, along with an order for 21 777-9 aircraft that are expected to be delivered starting in 2025.

Meanwhile, HK Express operates an all-Airbus fleet consisting of 5 A320-200s, 10 A320neos, 11 A321-200s, and one A321neo.

Cathay Pacific and HK Express serve a variety of destinations from their hub at Hong Kong International Airport (HKG). Cathay Pacific offers nonstop flights to 81 destinations in 29 countries across the Asia-Pacific region, North America, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. HK Express focuses on low-cost flights, offering service to 27 destinations in the Asia-Pacific region.

It is currently unknown how many aircraft will be A321neos compared to A320neos. Both aircraft are part of the Airbus A320neo family.

In addition, details have not yet been provided on how many of these aircraft will be used by Cathay Pacific compared to HK Express. The order will likely be evenly split, based on a previous A321neo order that involved 16 aircraft allocated to Cathay Pacific and 16 allocated to HK Express.

Cathay Pacific's fleet renewal plans come as the airline recovers from multiple problems Hong Kong has faced in recent years. The city has witnessed a reduction in international travel due to mass protests that took place in 2019 and the COVID-19 pandemic. The reopening of Hong Kong's borders and the removal of travel restrictions late last year has opened the door to resuming business and leisure travel.

A Strong Return

As a result, Cathay Pacific recorded its strongest first six months of the year profit since 2010 in the first half of 2023. The airline saw a profit of HK$4.3 billion ($550.22 million) compared to a loss of HK$5 billion ($639.3 million) in the same time period last year. Cathay Pacific expects its recovery to hit 70% by the end of this year and 100% by the end of 2024.

Cathay Pacific sees the introduction of additional aircraft to its fleet as an essential component of its recovery. Now that travel is allowed without restrictions and the political environment has stabilized, the next few years are expected to be bright for the airline and Hong Kong's tourism industry.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9914980530738831}",neutral,0.9914980530738831,0
Airbus Opens New A321XLR Hangar in Hamburg - Airways Magazine,"Wed, 30 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vbmV3LWEzMjF4bHItaGFuZ2FyLWhhbWJ1cmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DALLAS — Airbus has taken a new step forward in the line production of the upcoming Airbus A321XLR variant, which aims to be introduced as a new tool to connect smaller cities far away with a long-range narrow-body aircraft.

The manufacturer inaugurated today a new automated A321XLR equipping hangar at Hamburg-Finkenwerder Airport (XFW), home to the production and assembly of the long-successful Airbus A320 family of airplanes. This 9,600-square-meter facility will be dedicated to the installation and mounting of the rear fuselages of the XLR variant.

André Walter, Head of Airbus Commercial Aircraft Production in Germany, said, “With our new, state-of-the-art equipment installation hangar, we are now expanding our capacity to manufacture A321 fuselages and making an important contribution to supporting our ramp up. At the same time, we are reaffirming the importance of Hamburg for Airbus.”

The new hangar is equipped with a full range of advanced technologies for operations and manufacturing, such as automated logistics, fully digital systems, and test stations that can output the status of each fuselage section at any time.

Closer to an “Extra Large” Entry-Into-Service

The Airbus A321XLR, known as the “Xtra Long Range” variant, is a new version of the highly successful A320 family of aircraft.

This modification, which is based on the A321neo, significantly extends the range of the aircraft to 4700 nautical miles. This allows for previously unimaginable single-aisle routes, such as Madrid (MAD) to Seattle (SEA), Vienna (VIIE) to Hanoi (HAN), or Johannesburg (JNB) to Buenos Aires (EZE).

In addition to its impressive range, the A321XLR offers a 30% reduction in fuel burn per seat compared to previous-generation competing aircraft. This results in lower operating costs and a significant decrease in both noise and CO2 emissions.

While the program is on track for its planned entry-into-service in Q2 2024, there have been some challenges related to the redesign of the rear center fuel tank. This redesign is necessary to mitigate the risk of serious fires in the event of a survivable crash.

Orders for the A321XLR

Airbus’s latest project has received an impressive total of 570 orders from 27 different customers worldwide. Several airlines that focus on operating thin-demand long-haul routes have shown significant interest in the aircraft, including Icelandair (FI), IndiGo (6E), VietJet (VJ), and WizzAir (W6).

The transatlantic market is expected to see a high number of A321XLR aircraft. United Airlines (UA), American Airlines (AA), Iberia (IB), and Aer Lingus (EI) are among the carriers that have chosen this aircraft to connect smaller coastal cities with destinations on the other side of the ocean.

However, there are still critics within the airline community who question the viability of flying narrow-body airplanes on long-haul routes. They argue that the Airbus A321 cabin is too small and cramped for flights lasting eight to ten hours. What is your opinion on long-haul travel using single-aisle jets? Do you believe this approach holds promise for the industry?

"Airbus will equip A321XLR fuselages in Hamburg, Germany - AeroTime","Thu, 31 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvYWlyYnVzLXdpbGwtZXF1aXAtYTMyMXhsci1mdXNlbGFnZXMtaW4taGFtYnVyZy1nZXJtYW550gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWVyb3RpbWUuYWVyby9hcnRpY2xlcy9haXJidXMtd2lsbC1lcXVpcC1hMzIxeGxyLWZ1c2VsYWdlcy1pbi1oYW1idXJnLWdlcm1hbnkvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus announced that it has opened a special facility for the A321XLR in Hamburg, Germany.

According to the planemaker’s announcement, the facility at the German city comes with a “new automated A321XLR equipping hangar”, opened on August 30, 2023. The First Mayor of Hamburg Peter Tschentscher and the German Aerospace Coordinator Anna Christmann attended the opening ceremony.

“With our new, state-of-the-art equipment installation hangar, we are now expanding our capacity to manufacture A321 fuselages and making an important contribution to supporting our ramp up,” André Walter, head of Commercial Aircraft Production in Germany at Airbus, said.

Tschentscher added that the A321XLR will set “new standards in terms of sustainability, efficiency and range” for the Airbus A320 aircraft family.

“The start of production in the new equipment installation hangar is an important project for Hamburg as the world’s third largest civil aviation center,” Tschentscher continued.

The A321XLR hangar was designated as H259 and has 9,600 m2 (103,333.5 feet) of production space. It will welcome the components of rear fuselages for the largest A320neo family aircraft and the hangar “is equipped with a full range of state-of-the-art technologies for operations and manufacturing, such as automated logistics, fully digital systems, and test stations that can output the status of each fuselage section”.

Airbus said that the nearly 24 meters (78.7 ft) long fuselage sections will be equipped with all electrical and mechanical systems and other elements such as windows, floor panels or external antennas on an automated line consisting of eight stations at H259.

Before being moved to the Final Assembly Line (FAL) in Hamburg, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) will extensively test each fuselage section.

The latest announcement also said that Airbus plans for the A321XLR to enter service in early 2024, with 27 airlines or lessors having ordered 570 aircraft of the type.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9981350898742676}",neutral,0.9981350898742676,0

Boeing vs. Airbus: Who Has The Biggest Order Backlog? - AviationSource News,"Fri, 11 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb25zb3VyY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9hbmFseXNpcy9ib2VpbmctdnMtYWlyYnVzLXdoby1oYXMtdGhlLWJpZ2dlc3Qtb3JkZXItYmFja2xvZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As the aircraft manufacturing industry moves away from the COVID-19 pandemic, we ask the following question: Who has the biggest order backlog? Airbus or Boeing?

Using data from both Airbus and Boeing‘s orders & deliveries pages online, let’s see who has the biggest backlogs to contend with.

Without further ado, let’s get into it…

Starting with Airbus…

As per the European planemaker’s site, here is their overall table:

Single-Aisle A300/A310 A330 A340 A350 A380 TOTAL Total Orders 18543 816 1781 377 1034 251 22802 Total Deliveries 11273 816 1576 377 550 251 14843 Aircraft in Operation 10577 267 1461 203 550 232 13290

If you deduct the total orders from the total deliveries, this produces a backlog of around 7,959 aircraft, which is a considerable number of aircraft yet to be produced and delivered.

Such dominance from Airbus has come off the back of the woes that Boeing has had in the past with the 737 MAX and 787 programs alike, as well as its niche dominance with the A321XLR program too.

A lot of this backlog from the European planemaker is attributed to the single-aisle family, of which Airbus is wanting to increase production to 75 aircraft per month by 2026.

Having such a backlog isn’t stopping Airbus, however. At the Paris Air Show, a mega order for 500 aircraft was announced alongside long-standing customer IndiGo.

How Is Boeing Getting On?

Below is Boeing’s breakdown of total unfilled orders, with any adjustments made, as well as the overall backlog across the 737, 767, 777 & 787 programs:

Source: Boeing.

What we can see is that the backlog is lower than Airbus by 3,031 aircraft. However, this will no doubt continue to creep up and reduce the gap in due time.

At the Paris Air Show 2023 alone, they sold 359 aircraft, including those that are previously unidentified. Sales momentum like this occurred at the Farnborough Air Show last year as well.

As we head into the Dubai Air Show this year, it will be interesting to see whether such momentum can carry on moving forward or whether we have to wait for Farnborough next year to continue that pattern.

Overall…

What remains clear is that despite the sales momentum being experienced by Boeing at the moment, Airbus still comfortably leads ahead in terms of orders secured.

Looking ahead, it will be interesting to see whether Boeing can continue its sales momentum to get to a position where their backlog is similar to that of Airbus and show that it can sell more airplanes after a tumultuous few years.

But for now, all eyes are on both sides to see what else may get announced by the end of the year.
