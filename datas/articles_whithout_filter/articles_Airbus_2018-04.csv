Boeing and Airbus have 5 new challengers: Photos - Business Insider,"Wed, 04 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWJvZWluZy1haXJsaW5lci1jaGluYS1ydXNzaWEtY3JhaWMtY29tYWMtMjAxNy010gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLWFpcmxpbmVyLWNoaW5hLXJ1c3NpYS1jcmFpYy1jb21hYy0yMDE3LTU_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing and Airbus have dominated the commercial airliner market in recent years — effectively turning it into a duopoly.

However, a slew of new rivals from China, Russia, and Japan are set to challenge Airbus and Boeing for supremacy.

Bombardier and Embraer were once thought to be potential rivals for the dominant duo, but that hasn't quite materialized.

Embraer delivered the first of its next-generation E-Jet E2 airliners to Norwegian regional carrier Wideroe on Wednesday. The E-Jet E2 was once seen as a potential rival for smaller aircraft in Airbus' and Boeing's lineups. However, with Embraer in merger talks with Boeing, the E2 may actually end up being a complementary aircraft as opposed to a challenger.

The market for commercial jetliners is the most lucrative and arguably the most hotly contested segment in the aviation business. But for the past 15 years, that white-hot competition has almost exclusively been between two companies: Airbus and Boeing.

However, in recent years, a slew of new rivals has arrived on the scene with plans to take on Airbus and Boeing.

But before we get to the challengers, let's take a look at the next-generation offerings from Airbus and Boeing."
Bridging the gap with 3D printing - Airbus,"Mon, 09 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE4LTA0LWJyaWRnaW5nLXRoZS1nYXAtd2l0aC0zZC1wcmludGluZ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"First 3D-printed part visible to passengers will be flying soon with Finnair

When an airline updates its aircraft cabin layout, gaps are often created between the existing and new components. Such gaps need to be bridged before the aircraft can take on passengers, and time always is of the essence in returning a jetliner to revenue-generating service.



The traditional method of manufacturing a new plastic part involves creating custom-made injection moulding tooling – a process that is relatively complex, especially given the specialised nature of many components and the limited number needed for a typical cabin retrofit. By using 3D printing technology, Airbus has enabled small-batch manufacturing that is not only quicker than conventional moulding techniques but less expensive, too.

Where traditional production methods struggle, 3D printing shines

Not only are 3D-printed parts as strong as those made with traditional moulding methods, they can be made lighter in weight; an important consideration for jetliner interiors, where every kilogram counts. While 3D-printed parts have been integrated into Airbus aircraft in the past, the results were not deemed aesthetically pleasing enough to be used where they could be seen by passengers – until now.



Through a partnership with the Belgium-based Materialise company, Airbus now has the first 3D-printed parts seamlessly integrated into the cabins of its jetliners. These parts – spacer panels that fill end-gaps in a row of overhead storage compartments – have passed Airbus’ stringent cabin trim and quality standards and will soon be visible to passengers aboard Finnair’s A320 aircraft, whose cabin layout has been updated.



By using 3D printing, Airbus was able to create bio-inspired panels 15 percent lighter than if made using conventional production methods. This technology also enables the creation of complex internal support structures, such as lattices inside the panels, without imposing additional manufacturing costs.







While 3D-printed parts have been integrated into Airbus aircraft in the past, this spacer panel – which fills an end-gap in a row of overhead storage compartments – will be the first in public view, installed aboard an A320 flown by Finnair"
"Boeing and Airbus, the new 'super duopoly' - The Washington Post - The Washington Post","Wed, 25 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9uZXdzL3dvbmsvd3AvMjAxOC8wNC8yNS9ib2VpbmctYW5kLWFpcmJ1cy10aGUtbmV3LXN1cGVyLWR1b3BvbHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In April 2016, Delta Air Lines shook up the aviation world by announcing it would buy 75 jets from Bombardier, the Quebec aircraft manufacturer. Such orders are the routine stuff of the aviation industry, but this one was anything but routine. For not only did it allow the financially strapped maker of “regional” jets to finally launch a line of larger fuel-efficient jets into the American market, but it also put Bombardier on a course to challenge Boeing and Airbus in the larger and more lucrative market for bigger planes.

Now, two years later, having failed to use their legal and political muscle to preserve their highly profitable duopoly, Boeing and Airbus have done what desperate duopolists invariably try to do — buy up their potential competitors. For reasons that are both legal and political, the aerospace giants are likely to get away with it.

There are, in fact, two duopolies in the commercial aircraft business. There is the market for large jets — roughly speaking, those with 140 to 400 seats and a range of 3,500 to 8,000 miles, dominated by Boeing and Airbus. And there is the market for smaller “regional” jets with 40 to 90 seats, used on shorter flights to secondary cities — a market dominated by Bombardier and Brazil’s Embraer. Until recently, there was little or no overlap in the two markets and the duopolies had settled into a comfortable, at times cooperative, coexistence. But when the world’s airlines started to show interest in buying planes with 100 to 150 seats, Bombardier and Embraer saw an opportunity to extend their product lines in ways that, for the first time, would put them in a position to steal business away from Boeing and Airbus, which had not fundamentally redesigned their smaller single-aisle planes in decades.

For Bombardier, development of its new C Series of planes took more time and more money — $6 billion in all — than it had anticipated, requiring what amounted to a bailout from the governments of Canada and Quebec. Although Air Canada had placed an early order for the new jets, the leading U.S. airlines held back, partly out of concerns that Bombardier had spent so much developing the plane that it might not be around a decade later to offer training, parts, support and follow-on orders.

Boeing, however, was taking no chances. So eager was Boeing to prevent Bombardier from gaining a toehold in the American market that when United Airlines announced it was looking to place an order for new planes in the 120-seat range, Boeing offered to sell the smallest version of its 737 for a bargain-basement price, estimated in the trade press at $22 million, edging out Bombardier and Embraer. A month later, an increasingly desperate Bombardier responded in kind, snagging the Delta order for its C Series jets at a price Boeing would later claim was less than $20 million per plane.

Having failed to prevent Bombardier from finding a “launch customer,” Boeing did what it has always done — wrapped itself in the American flag and demanded help from Washington. Over the years, no American company has proved more adept than Boeing at using its political and legal muscle to boost its commercial fortunes. So within weeks of the inauguration of the most protectionist president in modern times, Boeing filed a complaint with the Commerce Department alleging Bombardier had snagged the Delta contract by “dumping” its government-subsidized airplanes in the U.S. market at a price below the cost of production, in violation of U.S. trade laws. After a lengthy evidentiary hearing, the Commerce Department agreed and recommended the independent International Trade Commission impose a 300 percent tariff on the C Series planes to offset the government subsidies Bombardier had received.

With the Delta order now in jeopardy — and with it, the future of the company — Bombardier went looking for partners and found a willing one in Airbus. Airbus agreed to form a joint venture with Bombardier to produce the C Series jets at Bombardier’s plant in Quebec and at a new Airbus facility in Mobile, Ala. Because the planes for Delta and other U.S. customers would be assembled on American soil, they would not be imports and not be subject to the anti-dumping tariffs.

It is a measure of how desperate Bombardier was for a financial lifeline, and for a way to sell its new plane into the U.S. market, that it agreed to sell Airbus a controlling 51 percent share of the new joint venture for $1 (Canadian), along with a guarantee that Bombardier would absorb the first $700 million in production losses from the C Series. Airbus, in turn, will take over responsibility for selling and servicing the airplane, which will be part of the Airbus product line. A few weeks later, nobody in the industry was surprised when Airbus announced it would discontinue production of its 124-seat A319.

Boeing was quick to criticize the Airbus-Bombardier alliance as “a questionable deal between two heavily state-subsidized competitors.” But to many in the industry, it looked as if Boeing’s strategy had backfired. Not only could Bombardier now enter the U.S. market with a sleek new fuel-efficient plane against which Boeing could offer no alternative — at least not without undermining its pricing for its smallest 737s — but it also had unwittingly strengthened the market position of its archrival, Airbus.

So Boeing decided it had no choice but to respond in kind and began serious negotiations to buy the commercial aircraft division of Embraer. Though the talks are ongoing, the deal would create a joint venture combining their commercial jet operations in which Boeing would retain 80 percent control, Reuters reports. The deal is under active consideration by the Brazilian government, which remains a shareholder in Embraer and has insisted Embraer’s defense division remain independent. An announcement is said to be imminent. If approved by antitrust regulators, what were once two duopolies in the global market for commercial jets will morph into what an analyst called one “super duopoly.”

Antitrust laws, of course, are meant to prevent mergers that substantially reduce competition, particularly in industries such as this one where there are already only a few competitors and high barriers for any new players to enter. What’s missing in this case, as so many others, are regulators or judges willing to aggressively enforce those laws and adapt them to a globalized high-tech economy where winner-take-all competition is more the rule than the exception.

In the case of Airbus and Bombardier, the Federal Trade Commission spent a couple of months reviewing the joint venture before deciding not to go to court to block it. The companies themselves declined to comment for the record, but according to people in government and industry, regulators concluded that without the joint venture Airbus-Bombardier would have failed financially and so the combination actually serves to enhance competition rather than reduce it. The FTC had accepted the same “failing firm” defense in approving Boeing’s purchase of its only remaining American rival, McDonnell Douglas, 20 years ago.

What that “failing firm” reasoning ignores, however, is the possibility that global competition could have been enhanced if the alliance with Airbus had been blocked and Bombardier had made its alliance with Japan’s Mitsubishi or China’s Comac, both of which are eager to break into the global market. That would have created a third strong player in the market to challenge the Boeing-Airbus duopoly — exactly what the antitrust law seeks to encourage.

American regulators and judges, however, have traditionally been reluctant to engage in such “what if” speculation. To the American ear, its smacks too much of “industrial policy,” with government playing too much of a role in deciding how many and which companies compete in strategically important markets.

That wasn’t always the case. As John Kwoka, an antitrust expert at Northeastern University Law School, has written, there was once a long line of Supreme Court cases that held that the “elimination of a firm perceived to be a potential entrant could violate the antitrust statutes as much as a merger between actual competitors,” on the theory that a mere threat of entry could act as a competitive check on the behavior of the dominant firms.

All that changed, however, in 1974, when the Supreme Court ruled in U.S. v. Marine Bancorporation that to stop a merger, the government must offer evidence of a substantial likelihood that the company being bought would have otherwise become a competitor. The court set the evidentiary bar so high that few potential competition cases have been brought in the past 40 years and even fewer have been successful.

Despite the reluctance of government officials to think of what they do as industrial policy, in fact industrial policy is always lurking behind every decision involving the aerospace industry, which every advanced country views as vital to its economy and its national security.

Competition regulators from the European Union, for example, have moved aggressively in recent years to rein in the market dominance of American companies such as Facebook, Google and Microsoft. But when it came to the Airbus-Bombardier deal, the E.U., as far as I can ascertain, never bothered even to review it. E.U. officials declined to discuss the matter, but you can be sure they were aware their political masters in Paris, Berlin and Brussels would not be thrilled if they tried to stop Airbus, the European champion, from gaining some advantage over Boeing.

For the same reason, don’t look for American regulators to stand in the way of Boeing’s tie-up with Embraer. To me and anyone else who will listen, Boeing officials already are peddling the idea that government-subsidized competitors from China, Japan and Russia are the real competitive threat looming on the horizon and that allowing Boeing to take over Embraer will put the American champion in a stronger position to withstand that “unfair” competition.

Their complaint about subsidies by foreign government is a valid one, of course, but it ignores the inconvenient fact that Boeing itself has benefited from billions of dollars in subsidies from the states of Washington, South Carolina and Missouri in recent years, to say nothing of the federal subsidies it received by way of loan guarantees from the Export-Import Bank and research and development subsidies embedded in the tens of billions of dollars of Pentagon contracts on Boeing’s order books. The “unfair subsidies” argument also ignores the inconvenient fact that, until a few years ago, Embraer itself was a government-owned enterprise and it has received billions of dollars in government support. And it ignores the inconvenient reality that, with a protectionist president and a protectionist Congress in power in Washington and strong anti-Russia and anti-China sentiment among voters, it will be many years before a Russian or Chinese airplane is sold into the U.S. market.

You might expect that the nation’s airlines would be complaining about losing the possibility of having three or four airplane companies vying for their business, but so far they, too, have been silent. Given that the airlines themselves have spent the past two decades reducing competition by merging with each other, they can hardly be expected to lead the charge for more vigorous antitrust enforcement. Rather than complain to the government about the anti-competitive nature of the joint ventures with Bombardier and Embraer, the airlines are more likely to use such opportunities to wring pricing and delivery concessions from Airbus and Boeing in return for keeping quiet.

Boeing, in fact, recently used that very tactic in responding to the proposed merger of two of its biggest parts suppliers, Rockwell Collins and United Technologies. When the $23 billion deal was announced in September, Boeing and Airbus publicly complained it would reduce competition in the aerospace supply chain. Then suddenly last month, Boeing dropped its opposition after announcing that United Technologies had agreed to participate in a Boeing supplier “cost-cutting initiative” — a polite way of saying it had been bought off.

It should be clear by now where all these mergers and acquisitions are leading to — a less than fully competitive aerospace sector in which there are only two giant parts makers and two or three engine makers supplying two giant aircraft manufacturers, which in turn supply only three or four giant airlines. To believe otherwise is simply naive. The level of consolidation in this, as in so many industries, has already reached the point where it is producing outsize profits, higher prices for consumers and declining rates of investment and innovation.

It will only get worse as long as judges and antitrust regulators refuse to recognize that it is no longer sufficient to look at existing competition in reviewing a merger or joint venture.

To remain relevant in today’s winner-take-all marketplace, effective antitrust policy now requires protection of potential competitors as well."

Airbus wants sleeper berths in airline cargo holds - USA TODAY,"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdHJhdmVsL2ZsaWdodHMvdG9kYXlpbnRoZXNreS8yMDE4LzA0LzEwL3NsZWVwZXItYmVydGhzLWFpcmxpbmUtY2FyZ28taG9sZHMtdGhhdHMtcGxhbi1haXJidXMvNTAyMzY1MDAyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sleeper berths in airline cargo holds? That’s the plan at Airbus

You might soon be able to sneak down to the cargo hold for a nap the next time you take an ultra-long trans-oceanic flight.

That’s the idea being floated by plane manufacturer Airbus and seatmaker Zodiac Aerospace. The companies say they’re working to develop “sleeping berths” that could be installed in the cargo holds of certain long-range Airbus aircraft.

Airbus and Zodiac Aerospace say the cargo compartment modules would “offer new opportunities for additional services to passengers, improving their experience while enabling airlines to differentiate and add value for their commercial operations.”

The companies say they hope to offer the option to airlines for orders beginning in 2020. Initially, the sleeper modules would be offered on Airbus’ A330 widebodies, either on new deliveries or with an option to retrofit existing aircraft. Adding the option to Airbus’ new long-range A350 jets “is also being studied.”

It’s unclear how the sleeper berths might be offered to passengers. Decisions on how to market and sell such options are typically left up to airline customers.

IN PICTURES: Behind the scenes: Airbus' A350 final assembly line (story continues below)

Airbus and Zodiac Aerospace did not detail any specific concepts, but it’s likely passenger carriers would consider several options. One might include selling access for passengers sitting elsewhere on the plane, presumably letting them pay for several hours — or perhaps an entire flight’s worth — of time in the sleepers.

Some higher-end carriers might explore the idea as a possibility to add a lounge area, where one of the perks could be a nap.

Airbus and Zodiac offered several concepts in mock-ups accompanying their press statement. One shows a standard lounge; others show options that include a conference room, a ""kids and family zone"" and even a ""medical care zone.""

Absent additional details, the berths are unlikely to become an option for the entire duration of a flight. Safety rules require passengers to be buckled into seats during takeoff and landing, and it’s not clear whether such an option would be available in a cargo area of sleeper berths. It also seems unlikely that a passenger would want to commit to a sleeper berth for flights of eight hours or more without a dedicated option for upright seating, or windows.

""The modules would not be occupied during takeoff or landing,"" Airbus spokesman Martin Fendt said by email to USA TODAY's Today in the Sky blog. ""These underfloor sleeping berths would be aimed more towards economy class market, and would be available for a lower price for a passenger than a premium class flatbed seat.""

Airbus and Zodiac Aerospace touted the ease of installation to carriers, saying modules would be “easily interchangeable with regular cargo containers during a typical turnaround if required. Moreover, the aircraft’s cargo floor and cargo loading system will not be affected at all, as the passenger module will sit directly on it.”

For now, Airbus and Zodiac Aerospace will test the market to see if any airlines are interested.

There might be at least one. Last month, the CEO of Australian carrier Qantas — which just launched a 17-hour route between Perth and London — expressed interest in such an idea.

""One of the concepts that we have is maybe if we're not carrying freight you do something lower where cargo is on the aircraft; do you have an area where people can walk? Do you have berths like on a train?” Qantas’ Alan Joyce said during a March conversation quoted by The Sydney Morning Herald.

“There's a lot of 'out there' thinking that's going on,"" Joyce added. ""I don't know if in 2022 if there's another going to be another class, but if there is Qantas is likely to be the airline that creates it.""

Stay tuned …

For example, on the upper deck, ANA has introduced eight First Class seats, 56 Business Class seats, and 73 Premium Economy seats.This marks the first time ANA has offered First Class on this resort route, and its aim is to provide passengers with a luxurious onboard experience. Each seat features its own door and provides passengers with the privacy they need to enjoy their personal space.ANA's Business Class is a popular option for passengers on honeymoons and family vacations. Therefore, compared to other aircraft where seats are staggered, this revolutionary Business Class offers pairs of seats, allowing passengers to enjoy and share their exciting travel experience sitting next to each other while still keeping all seats with aisle access.Furthermore, while Premium Economy on other aircraft has about 20 seats, the FLYING HONUs offer 73, allowing more passengers the opportunity to experience the premium features.The main deck will have 383 Economy Class seats, which includes 60 couch seats. This makes ANA the first in Japan to introduce a couch seat concept. Each couch is comprised of three or four seats and passengers are able to lie on the seats by folding up the leg rests. In addition, passengers will receive a dedicated mattress that will provide them with further comfort. This new seat concept will especially enable passengers traveling with small children to have a more relaxed experience in the cabin."
Airbus launches advanced indoor inspection drone to reduce aircraft inspection times and enhance report quality - Airbus,"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wNC1haXJidXMtbGF1bmNoZXMtYWR2YW5jZWQtaW5kb29yLWluc3BlY3Rpb24tZHJvbmUtdG8tcmVkdWNlLWFpcmNyYWZ00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"· To be available for MROs and airlines in the last quarter of 2018

· First application for Airbus’ single-aisle family

· Developed in partnership with Testia, Airbus’ non-destructive testing subsidiary

At MRO Americas, Airbus is demonstrating for the first time a drone-based, innovative maintenance tool – Airbus’ Advanced Inspection Drone – for use inside a hangar, which accelerates and facilitates visual checks, considerably reducing aircraft downtime and increasing the quality of inspection reports.



Combining Airbus’ extensive aircraft knowledge with best-in-class drone technology, this new product consists of a smart, automatic drone with an integral visual camera, a laser-based obstacle detection sensor, flight planner software and an Airbus’ aircraft inspection software analysis tool. Developed in co-operation with Airbus’ subsidiary Testia which specialises in non-destructive testing, this drone-based aircraft inspection system is optimised for inspecting the upper parts of the aircraft fuselage.

Following a predefined inspection path, the automated drone captures all the required images with its on-board camera. High quality pictures are then transferred to a PC database for detailed analysis using a software system. This allows the operator to localise and measure visual damage on the aircraft’s surface by comparing it with the aircraft’s digital mock-up. The software automatically generates an inspection report.

The new system will be available for the industry in the fourth quarter of 2018 following EASA approval of the new inspection process. Initial demonstrations have been made to several airlines which have expressed interest. It will also be offered to MRO organisations. Since it is designed for use inside maintenance hangars, the drone is equipped with a laser-based sensor capable of detecting obstacles and halting the inspection if necessary. This laser-based technology allows the vehicle to fly automatically without the need for remote piloting.

Upgrading to the new drone-based system will enable operators and MRO providers to reduce inspection time, allow the aircraft to be released earlier while enhancing the overall quality of the reports, improving damage localisation, repeatability and traceability. The new inspection process will take only three hours, including 30 minutes of image capture by the drone, and will improve operator safety. By contrast, traditional aircraft visual inspection is performed from the ground or using a telescopic platform, in particular for the upper parts of the aircraft – a process which could typically last up to one day.

The new drone-based inspection system is an element of Airbus’ ‘Hangar of the Future’ (HoF), an innovation maintenance project initiated by Airbus in Singapore two years ago. HoF combines the use of innovative technologies and smart, ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT)-connected equipment such as ‘collaborative robots’ (cobots), drones, scanners, cameras and non-destructive sensors, with aircraft technical documentation and aircraft in-service data collected by Airbus’ open data platform, Skywise. Through the digitisation and automation of maintenance activities, Airbus is responding to the increasing maintenance needs of airlines with growing fleets, creating value for all stakeholders."

One element of the UltraFan programme is planning for ground and flight tests, and to support this Rolls-Royce has signed an agreement with Airbus to provide both nacelle and engine/aircraft integration architecture and technology enablers.

Airbus’ integration solutions will play an important part in achieving the overall fuel efficiency improvement of higher bypass ratio engines such as UltraFan, through innovative architecture and associated technologies.

Axel Flaig, Airbus Head of Research and Technology, said: “This technology development programme with Rolls-Royce is a key project for Airbus to pave the way towards the next generation integrated propulsion systems that will be needed by airline customers towards the end of the next decade. We thank the Clean Sky 2 European funding programme for its strong support to this project which is a key contributor towards the ACARE environmental targets.”

Andy Geer, Rolls-Royce, Chief Engineer and Head of Programme - UltraFan, said: “This is another step forward in our UltraFan engine journey and it is great to have Airbus expertise to further strengthen our ability to deliver this important development programme. We remain very grateful to Clean Sky 2 for its continued recognition of the environmental benefits that UltraFan will bring.”

UltraFan features a new engine core architecture and lean-burn combustion system which will contribute to improved fuel burn efficiency and lower emissions, along with a carbon titanium fan blade system and composite casing which reduce weight. The engine also introduces a geared design to deliver efficient power at high-bypass ratios.

For Airbus, the project will enable it to fully integrate the overall powerplant system – composed of engine, pylon and nacelle – onto future long-range aircraft products, as well as facilitating scalability for future short-range aircraft. It will also build on Airbus’ expertise in advanced manufacturing technologies, such as high-deposition-rate additive manufacture, welded assembly and high production rate thermoplastics."

Airbus’ Day and Night concept: eye-opener or eye-roller? - Runway Girl Network,"Sun, 22 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTgvMDQvYWlyYnVzLWRheS1hbmQtbmlnaHQtY29uY2VwdC1leWUtb3BlbmVyLW9yLWV5ZS1yb2xsZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What’s the future of first class travel? One suggestion at the Aircraft Interiors Expo was Airbus’ Day and Night cabin, offering an intriguing floor-to-ceiling sleeping space shut away alongside (literally) a more convivial dining and seating area.

The concept is an interesting one, especially in the context of Emirates’ latest Boeing 777 suite’s floor-to-ceiling cocoon — and indeed given the appearance elsewhere on the show floor of the sub-floor sleeping bunks Airbus is working on with Zodiac.

Essentially, daytime seats sit next to the windows, with interleaved bedrooms across the widebody aisles in the centre sections of the cabin. Layout-wise, the effect is a little reminiscent of what you might do with the Etihad Apartment product if you wanted to avoid having only one aisle.

The daytime seats are largely unspecified: two bucket-style chairs facing a perspex table with a semi-present bulkhead wall. Airbus explains that the idea is for the bulkhead between the two tables to be removable to allow relaxing and dining à deux, which is a sensible move given the number of passengers in first class travelling together.

Clearly, airlines and their design partners will have strong feelings about the look and feel of these spaces, so it makes sense at this early stage for Airbus not to have overthought how the seating element might look.

The sleeping part, however, is a much more complete presentation. Bunks interleave perpendicularly to the two aisles, cocooned in a cubby space that feels like a larger, side-on first class version of a forwards-backwards stagger, à la Etihad Business Studio or Qatar Qsuite.

With a dressing and living area for those passengers who don’t want to sit by the window, essentially each passenger has an interlocking L-shaped living space.

The bunks are relatively wide compared with some of the first class suite products currently on the market, which tend to be a little bit youth hostel rather than luxury hotel. Each bunk doesn’t stretch the entire width of the centre section, allowing a corner of the suite for entry/exit, dressing and potentially as a private hideaway.

It all feels very elegantly unbranded, and rather 1960s futurist French chic — think André Courrèges meets Oscar Niemeyer. (That said, this Francophone notes quietly that a more accurate equivalent of the French phrase “le jour et la nuit” into English is “night and day”, not “day and night”, which has a separate meaning. Perhaps additional thought to the implications of how products are branded for the international market would be wise.)

It’s clear that the product is most efficient installed in blocks of four, given the interleaving of the beds and the face-to-face seating, but if an airline wanted just two first class seats and to lose the latter (or to boost capacity to six but not eight passengers with two not having face-to-face options) it seems that it could.

The concept is a fascinating one, and shows the way that one of the industry’s two widebody airframers is thinking about the future of first class — not least, that it has a future.

And from a cabin interiors industry inside baseball perspective, it’s equally fascinating that the concept comes from the growing Airbus Interiors Services part of the airframer, which dominated a full half of the large Airbus stand at AIX without even taking into account that subsidiary Stelia also had a large presence. Clearly, Airbus believes that there is serious bank to be made in this part of the market

But there’s little denying the Beluga is also one of the homeliest airplanes I’ve ever seen, reminding me of a creature with a huge body matched with a tiny head. Ugly or exotic, Airbus found a market for the airplane 20 years ago, transporting some fuselage parts for the massive A380.

The Beluga fleet eventually grew to five aircraft, but the airplane by any standard is pretty long in the tooth having first flown in 1983. In addition to an aging airplane, Airbus envisioned a larger capacity platform and so the Beluga XL, based on the A330 platform, was born.

The new Beluga fleet will also grow to five aircraft. Airbus

The new Beluga XL, expected to enter service sometime next year, is 20 feet longer and three feet wider than the original A300 version. With more efficient engines, the XL will also haul six tons more cargo the first whales. That translates into two sets of A350 wings per trip rather than only one. When the new Belugas replace the earlier versions, they will also make it easier to transport A380 components, like wing sections, while eliminating the time-consuming overland excursion and barge travel Airbus has been using for years."
Airbus to offer sleeping berths down in cargo hold - Phys.org,"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE4LTA0LWFpcmJ1cy1iZXJ0aHMtY2FyZ28uaHRtbNIBNWh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE4LTA0LWFpcmJ1cy1iZXJ0aHMtY2FyZ28uYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus wants to offer airlines the possibility of installing passenger sleeping berths in the cargo holds of its A330 jets from 2020

Soon when you fly in an Airbus jet and you fancy a bit of shut-eye, all you will need do is make your way down to the cargo hold.

European aircraft giant Airbus announced on Tuesday that it is teaming up with Zodiac Aerospace to develop and market lower deck sleeping facilities for passengers that could be operational in A330 wide-body jets from 2020.

The sleeper compartments ""would fit inside the aircraft's cargo compartments,"" Airbus said in a joint statement with Zodiac, a subsidiary of the French aerospace company Safran.

The modules ""will be easily interchangeable with regular cargo containers,""the statement said.

""Airlines will initially be able to choose from a catalogue of certified solutions by 2020 on A330,"" for the sleeper pods, with the possibility of fitting them into A350 XWB airliners also being studied.

Airbus and Zodiac said the sleeping berths would not only improve passenger comfort, but also enable airlines to add value for their commercial operations.

""This approach to commercial air travel is a step change towards passenger comfort,"" said Geoff Pinner, head of Airbus' cabin and cargo programme.

""We have already received very positive feedback from several airlines on our first mock-ups.""

Christophe Bernardini, head of Zodiac's aerospace cabin division, said the project ""reaffirms our expertise in lower-deck solutions. An improved passenger experience is today a key element of differentiation for airlines.""

In November 2016, the Air France-KLM had put forward the idea of sleeping berths for passengers in the economy class, either down in the hold or above the cabin in aircraft of the group's new low-cost subsidiary, Joon.

The A321LR variant of Airbus’ A321 jetliner underscored its impressive range with a record-breaking flight from Mahé in the Seychelles islands to Toulouse, France – covering a total distance of 4,750 nautical miles in 11 hours.

This milestone was reached in late March as part of the A321LR’s 100-hour flight test and certification programme. To make flight conditions as realistic as possible while evaluating cabin systems, the A321LR carried 162 human heat-replicating dummy passengers in addition to its 16-member test crew.

According to flight test engineer Jim Fawcett, the A321LR’s flight characteristics and fuel consumption were as expected throughout the lengthy trip. He added: “The A321LR has completed 15 test flights. It is an excellent aircraft that keeps its promises in terms of flight behaviour, passenger comfort and fuel consumption.”

Outfitted for superior long-range performance

The A321LR has the longest range of any single-aisle jetliner, with an increased maximum take-off weight of 97 tonnes (compared to 93.5 tonnes for the A321), plus the addition of a third auxiliary centre fuel tank. The jetliner is ideally suited to transatlantic routes, allowing airlines to tap into new long-haul markets that were not previously accessible with current single-aisle aircraft.

The A321LR – which is on track for a 2018 service entry – also features a new door configuration that enables up to 240 passengers to be accommodated in the widest single-aisle fuselage in the sky.

The record-breaking flight followed A321LR hot weather testing performed at Sharjah International Airport in the United Arab Emirates, which was selected by Airbus due to the optimal weather conditions and this location’s excellent facilities.

Airbus and the German car manufacturer Audi have teamed up to develop real, near-term urban mobility solutions.

Beginning this summer, Airbus – through its on-demand helicopter platform Voom – will partner with Audi to deliver an end-to-end transportation service, starting in São Paulo and Mexico City. This partnership will provide premium ground transportation serviced by Audi vehicles and helicopter transport via Airbus’ Voom service, allowing customers to have a seamless and ultra-convenient travel experience.

“This important partnership with Audi addresses both current and future challenges for urban mobility. As a first concrete milestone in the cooperation we are developing, we will be offering multi-modal transportation solutions to the world’s most congested cities,” said Airbus CEO Tom Enders. “The world is rapidly urbanizing, and ground infrastructure alone cannot meet the demands of tomorrow. Increased congestion is pushing the cities’ transport systems to the limits, costing travellers and municipalities valuable time and money. Adding the sky as a third dimension to the urban transport networks is going to revolutionise the way we live – and Airbus is ready to shape and build that future of flight.”

“The Audi Group is committed to improve mobility in cities by introducing smart, innovative ideas. To find the best solutions for our customers, we therefore showed in 2018 the first modular system for Urban Air Mobility together with Airbus and our subsidiary Italdesign,” said Audi CEO Rupert Stadler. “Today we are going the next step entering into a service with Airbus and Voom to offer premium mobility for customers. By doing this, we will learn even better how we can ensure seamless, multi-modal transportation with the best partners for our customers. Together with Airbus, we will develop this cooperation further.”

Airbus has already carried out successful trials in São Paulo of its helicopter ride-hailing service Voom, which aims to ease congestion by making helicopter travel more accessible and affordable. Since March 2018, the service is also available in Mexico City. Airbus and Italdesign are partnering on Pop Up, a full electric auto piloted and modular concept including a capsule connected to either ground or air module. Elsewhere, teams are working to create entirely new vehicles: CityAirbus, ready to fly before the end of 2018, is a technology demonstrator of an electric vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) vehicle for up to four passengers. Vahana aims to create a similar mode of transport for individual travellers or cargo. It completed its first full-scale flight in January 2018. In Singapore, the company is working with the country’s National University on the Skyways project to test a parcel transportation system using autonomous drones.

"Diesel engine viable for light singles, Airbus says - Vertical Magazine","Thu, 05 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvZGllc2VsLWVuZ2luZS12aWFibGUtbGlnaHQtc2luZ2xlcy1haXJidXMtc2F5cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In the framework of a European research program, Airbus Helicopters in 2016 completed a flight-test program with a diesel engine on an H120 single. Test results have been analyzed and the program was a technical success, Airbus claims. However, an application still has to be found, as no engine manufacturer has picked up the work yet. This may explain why Airbus has been quiet about the program.

The goal, as part of the EU’s Clean Sky public-private “technology initiative,” was to demonstrate a diesel engine is a viable alternative to a turboshaft on a light single. The expected benefit was a reduced fuel burn, thanks to the greater efficiency. Challenges, meanwhile, were the torque oscillation of a piston engine, its weight and cooling.

With a diesel engine, a light single would have a greater endurance. The tested H120 could have flown eight hours, Christian Mercier, Airbus Helicopters’ chief research engineer for new engines, told Vertical. It would thus be highly suitable for operations such as power line surveillance, he said.

An additional advantage is better hot-and-high performance.

The company refers to a “high-compression engine,” rather than “diesel,” perhaps to keep away from the negative publicity that has hit diesel engines in the automotive sector in recent years.

After a two-month evaluation on an iron bird followed by one month of ground tests with the H120, five flight hours were enough to check every specification was met, according to Mercier. The trials of the 330-kilowatt (440-shaft-horsepower) powerplant were thus “a complete success,” Mercier said.

At takeoff power, the fuel consumption (using kerosene) was cut by 30 percent over that of a turboshaft. At cruise power (around 130 shp), it was “more than halved.” The average reduction, calculated over a mission, was 42 percent.

The solution to torque oscillation was the dampening system Airbus and its Clean Sky partners designed. The diesel engine was thus made compatible with a helicopter gearbox.

Another challenge was cooling. A piston engine’s thermodynamics call for a more complex system. The “power pack” on the H120 included a large fan and added non-negligible weight to an already heavy engine. Nevertheless, the engine and accompanying cooling system are much cheaper than a comparable turboshaft, according to Mercier.

At 0.8 kg/kW (including the cooling system), the weight index density is twice lower than that of a turboshaft but much better than piston engines in conventional cars. That number was achieved thanks to the input of a company specializing in car racing, Teos Powertrain Engineering. A power density of 0.6 kg/kW is within reach, Mercier said.

Teos and Austro Engine (part of the Diamond Aircraft group) co-designed the V8 engine. However, Airbus retains its intellectual property, Mercier stated. No established engine-maker seems to have expressed interest yet.

In addition to helicopters, the engine is deemed suitable for fixed-wing aircraft in general aviation, as well as auxiliary power units for commercial aircraft."

SAS said Tuesday it had ordered 50 Airbus A320-neos for its short and medium-haul routes, a sign of improving fortunes for the Scandinavian carrier after some difficult years.

Thirty-five of the planes will be bought directly from Airbus. They have a list price, before discounts agreed between SAS and Airbus, of just under $4 billion (3.2 billion euros), the airline said in a statement.

The other 15 aircraft will be leased.

SAS already has 17 Airbus A320neos in service from a previous order for 30 Airbus A320neos. The new order means SAS will have at least 80 Airbus A320neos in service by 2023, SAS said.

The purchase will enable it to have a single-type fleet by 2023.

The leased planes will be delivered from the spring of 2019 through 2021, while the remaining 35 are scheduled to be delivered directly by Airbus by 2023.

In a bid to reduce costs, SAS has in recent years aimed to simplify its fleet. It now has two aircraft types in service within Europe, compared to six in 2012.

""In line with the deliveries of the new Airbus A320neos, SAS will begin phasing out its Boeing 737 and the existing Airbus A320 aircraft,"" it said.

The order also includes options for an additional five A320neos, the carrier said.

After experiencing several challenging years amid fierce competition from low-cost rival Norwegian Air Shuttle, SAS is now on the mend.

At the end of its fiscal year in October, the company posted a pre-tax profit, excluding one-off items, of almost 2.0 billion kronor ($239 million, 196.7 million euros).

In a statement Friday, Chief Executive Tom Enders said the company's performance reflected a shortage of engines for its A320neo plane. The aircraft is a more fuel-efficient version of the company's best-selling airliner, the A320.

Airbus said that dozens of A320neo aircraft were sitting at the company's headquarters in Toulouse, France, and at a plant in Hamburg, Germany, awaiting engines from Pratt & Whitney and CFM International.

""It's a challenging situation for all but based on the confidence expressed by the engine makers and their ability to deliver on commitments, we can confirm our full-year outlook,"" CEO Enders said.

Overall, the aircraft maker shipped 121 jets in the first three months — the least since the third quarter of 2011 — and well behind a scheduled production of 800 planes for the full year.

Deliveries logjam

With regard to the A320neo, the plane's new engines have suffered from technical glitches as a result of a completely new design boasting aerodynamic modifications that allow airlines to save 15 percent on fuel. The medium-range, single-aisle aircraft has attracted thousands of orders as airlines seek to cut costs to ensure they remain competitive in the future.

The earnings statement did not refer to plans to increase A320neo output further than planned in 2019 — to 63 aircraft a month from a previous target of 60, as disclosed earlier this week.

The head of French engine maker Safran, a partner in CFM alongside General Electric, had expressed caution over the plans on Wednesday, saying it was too early to commit to higher output as suppliers work through what is already a record production ramp-up.

In the quarter, Airbus also faced challenges with the A380 superjumbo, the world's largest civilian airliner. The company said it would slow deliveries of the wide-body aircraft to 50 planes a year from 2019, versus 67 in 2017.

In addition, cost-overruns continued to plague production of the A400M military transport aircraft. The company said it's working to finalize an amended contract for the A400M, after government customers agreed to a revised delivery plan requiring production of just eight aircraft a year from 2020.

Printed electrics is a new digital technology using conductive inks to print routes for data and power transmission to replace current harnesses.

Massively reducing the part count leads to a reduction of weight and manufacturing cost as well as a simplified architecture, while allowing for last-minute customisation. To make this future technology fly, a joint Airbus and Altran project team has developed a demonstrator for a first use-case on an A320 – the printed Info Panel. This cabin interior panel displays passenger-related safety and comfort information. The new concept could replace the current electrical harness with printed circuits on a flexible foil, making the first step to a harness-free aircraft.

Geoff Pinner, Head of Cabin & Cargo Programme Airbus, said: “Winning one of the aviation’s ‘Oscars’ together with Altran for printed electrics shows that we are continuously pushing the latest in innovative cabin design solutions and innovate for our customers and passengers worldwide. I congratulate the team on their fantastic job and on their well-deserved success.”

Sébastien Renouard, Group VP AeroSpace Defense & Railway Altran, said: ""We are thrilled and delighted to have won the Crystal Cabin Award for the first time as it underlines our constant drive for innovation and cooperation spirit with our customers to develop the next generation technologies. Printed electrics is an outstanding example of applying disruptive technologies to revolutionise cabin design.""

In the future, printed electrics technology could be introduced to the areas of cabling for air conditioning, data transmission and lighting.

The Crystal Cabin Award is the leading international award for excellence in aircraft interior innovation, sponsored by the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg. More than 90 concepts from 18 nations were entered in the competition across eight categories.

Autonomous Skies - Airbus,"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE4LTA0LWF1dG9ub21vdXMtc2tpZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The future of transport lies in the skies. By developing a range of cutting-edge autonomous technologies, Airbus is working towards a world of self-piloting urban air mobility vehicles, cargo drones and more autonomous commercial aircraft. The vision: a safer, more efficient and eco-friendly global transport network.

Handing control of a vehicle over to a machine can be a strange feeling. “On the first few journeys, it’s hard to relax,” says Dirk Dickmanns. The expert for image-based automation knows what he is talking about. Before joining Airbus 10 years ago, he helped programme autonomous cars at BMW. He learned that few people believe a computer can compete with their own abilities in this respect. “But, over time,” Dickmanns explains, “this feeling changes. And I believe that in future, machines will be safer, more efficient drivers and pilots than humans are.”

Dickmanns is one of many people across Airbus working to turn the goal of autonomous flight into reality. It’s a complex, wide-ranging field: not only does it involve designing and building aircraft that can ‘think’ and fly themselves, but also establishing new ground infrastructure, air traffic management systems and working with authorities to regulate entirely new modes of transport, from cargo drones to flying taxis.

Increasing urbanisation means the skies above our cities hold the key to fast, efficient travel in the future.

Tailored human-machine interaction

One of the reasons behind Airbus’ drive towards greater autonomy is a rapid growth in air travel. Commercial aviation traffic is set to double in the next 15 years; and increasing urbanisation means the skies above our cities hold the key to fast, efficient travel in the future.

“By harnessing powerful computer technology and increasing levels of autonomy, we can optimise flight trajectories,” says Pascal Traverse, Head of Autonomy at Airbus. “We expect this to bring multiple social and environmental benefits, such as saving fuel and reducing noise, as well as allowing for easier vehicle sharing and easing the burden on our natural resources.”

Traverse says any discussion of autonomy must first outline what the term means. “We consider a system to be autonomous when it is able to take decisions without human acknowledgement or initiation,” he explains. “But autonomy is not an all-or-nothing proposition, rather a tailored human-machine interaction that evolves over time. Look at the cockpit crew for commercial aviation: we went from four to three and now two.” Now, Airbus is concentrating on reducing the workload of the crew further. Autonomous technologies will allow the crew to focus more on managing the mission instead of managing the machine. ”Eventually, this could mean reducing the size of the crew for long-haul flights from three or four to two, or even single-pilot operations.

“Without automating airspace control, we cannot realise the future we imagine. We are currently in the process of setting up projects in several countries to better understand how we can integrate drones into our airspace in a safe, reliable manner.”

“Our EAGLE project is currently combining these aspects to build a complete vision system. This will enable high-performance power for image-processing algorithms – enhancing the image recognition capabilities of an autonomous aircraft.”

Arne Stoschek, Head of Autonomous Systems at A³ by Airbus

“Autonomous cars have gone from proof of concept to a commercial reality in just over a decade. Here in Silicon Valley, I see them on the road every day. With Vahana, we have already demonstrated that autonomous flight is a realistic concept. Imagine what we will be able to do with autonomous flight in the next 10 years and the amazing opportunities this presents to Airbus.”

Autonomous flight – the applications

Autonomous systems are already in place in a number of Airbus products used for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. Satellites and remotely piloted aircraft are able to fly alone under supervision from a ground-based operator. In case communication is lost, they can still execute certain pre-programmed actions. The next step is to have these vehicles make more intelligent decisions in the air, such as verify the quality of the images they are taking and retake if necessary, rather than send them to the ground for human assessment; or communicate with other satellites that may be better positioned to take pictures.

Cargo drones and flying taxis

A more visible use of autonomous systems will be their role in transporting goods and people. We can expect to see cargo drones buzzing ahead and self-piloted vehicles whisking passengers from the airport to the city centre.

In February 2018, Airbus’ Skyways parcel delivery drone successfully completed its first flight demonstration in Singapore, while prototyping for the Quadcruiser to deliver heavier loads such as medical supplies is also underway. And in January this year, Vahana, a project aimed at advancing electric, self-piloted VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) flight, made its maiden test flight and is currently progressing through the next stage of testing. Development on the multi-passenger CityAirbus, which also uses self-piloting, VTOL and electric propulsion technology, is progressing well, with a first flight scheduled for the end of 2018.

As Harini Kulatunga, Head of Future Solutions for Unmanned Aerial Systems, explains, a major increase in the number of aircraft in the sky will require a new system to manage the traffic. “Without automating airspace control, we cannot realise the future we imagine. We are currently in the process of setting up projects in several countries to better understand how we can integrate drones into our airspace in a safe, reliable manner. There are a number of challenges to overcome: they have to be able to talk to each other, react to changes in weather conditions and recognise no-fly zones such as airports. We hope to partner with start-ups and key technology companies to realise this vision within the next two years.”

Kulatunga says some of the work she and her team are doing will eventually be transferable to commercial, helicopter and urban air mobility flights. But before that, it is a twin task of developing technology and liaising with aviation authorities to find the right regulatory framework. “We need to work as one team to position Airbus as the leader in this key technology enabler that will drive new business in the future,” she says.

Autonomous technologies will allow the crew to focus more on managing the mission instead of managing the machine.

Helping aircraft to see

For any vehicle to fly autonomously, it has to be able to ‘see’. Colleagues Experts across the company, including Dirk Dickmanns at Defence and Space, and Nicolas Damiani, Senior Expert in Systems Simulation at Helicopters, are working on image-capturing technology. “Our task is to provide the basis of autonomy. Computer vision is provided via various sensors such as HD cameras as well as radar or lidar data,” Damiani explains. “Our EAGLE project is currently combining these aspects to build a complete vision system. This will enable high-performance power for image-processing algorithms – enhancing the image recognition capabilities of an autonomous aircraft.”

One area of focus is to automate take-off and low-speed manoeuvres for VTOL and landing via image recognition: an aircraft automatically identifies a helipad or runway, assesses the adequate final approach and controls the flight accordingly, until landing. “The main challenge is data integrity in reduced visibility – is the system really recognising a runway? Or is it, perhaps, a road, canal or rowing lake?” says Dickmanns. “To overcome this, we have to generate better algorithms for the computer systems that are more sensitive to distinguishing different features.”

To accelerate this technology, this April Airbus launched a project to modify an A320 test aircraft. Named ATTOL – Autonomous Taxi, Take-Off and Landing – the demonstrator aims to unite all Airbus divisions and innovation centres to work together.

5G Connectivity is an critical enabler for robust communication between unmanned vehicles. Airbus UTM Lab tests design proposals for hard to disrupt networks.

Sense and avoid

A similar principle lies at the heart of what is perhaps the most important element of autonomous flight – sense and avoid technology. Arne Stoschek, Head of Autonomous Systems at A3 by Airbus, has been working on Vahana for two years. “The key technology at Vahana is artificial intelligence, in particular deep learning – a very powerful mathematical method that allows the vehicle to understand a complex environment and then make decisions.”

It’s all based on a vast amount of data captured using drones that emulate how and where Vahana would fly, as well as the obstacles it would encounter. Stoschek says he and his five-man team have gathered 400,000 data points, from images of aircraft to birds in the sky. “We use this data to train a computer model. Like a human, the computer model learns from the experiences presented through the data we collect and update it with. We’ll continue to collect data to push future, verified versions to the on-board system. The fixed capabilities of the on-board guidance system thereby know how to react to each event. What makes deep learning so interesting is that it is robust in dealing with the many different situations and environments that aircraft can operate in.”

Like Dickmanns, Stoschek has a background in autonomous cars and he sees parallels with the rapid progress in autonomous flight. “Autonomous cars have gone from proof of concept to a commercial reality in just over a decade. Here in Silicon Valley, I see them on the road every day. With Vahana, we have already demonstrated that autonomous flight is a realistic concept. Imagine what we will be able to do with autonomous flight in the next 10 years and the amazing opportunities this presents to Airbus.”"
Pontifications: The Airbus-Boeing chess game - Leeham News and Analysis,"Mon, 02 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxOC8wNC8wMi9wb250aWZpY2F0aW9ucy10aGUtYWlyYnVzLWJvZWluZy1jaGVzcy1nYW1lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"April 2, 2018, © Leeham News.: While Boeing edges toward a decision whether to launch the New Midrange Aircraft, the NMA or 797 as it’s known, Airbus ponders how to respond—either pre-emptively or after Boeing’s move.

Responding with an A321neo Plus is widely known, but it’s also logical the Airbus would look at enhancements for the A320neo. Less likely but probably studied are also enhancements to the A319neo. Studies, after all, pre-date the agreement last fall with Bombardier to acquire 50.01% of the C Series program and Airbus clearly understood that the present A319neo is as unattractive as was the original design of the Boeing 737-7.

Modifying the 737-7

Boeing, of course, modified the 737-7 to add two rows of seats and make it a straight-forward shrink of the 737-8.

The “737-7.5,” as Jon Ostrower famously dubbed it, puts the A319neo at a further disadvantage. With the CS300, the A319neo is the proverbial dead man walking.

Stretching the A321 and A320 has been fodder for the Internet airplane enthusiasts for years. A stretch of the A319 could also be undertaken.

Stretching the A319 and A320 would only match the 737-7 and 737-8, but along with aerodynamic improvements would certainly match or maybe slightly exceed the Boeings in economy.

An A321neo Plus—a modest stretch, more powerful engines, more range and aerodynamic improvements, however, would really put the 737-9/10 away. There’s room left for one more round of A320 enhancements; there’s no more room for any more 737 models.

As it is, the stats clearly show how Airbus’ single aisle airplane has overtaken the 737.

Despite a 20-year head start with the 737, through February Airbus has sold nearly as many A320s. There are more A320s in services than 737s.

(March data was not available as this was written. “A320s” in this context refers to all family members.)

Boeing leads in 737s delivered, by a wide margin, as you would expect from a 20-year head start. The 10,000th 737 was just produced, for Southwest Airlines.

Boeing’s next step

Preoccupied as it is with the NMA, with the MAX only entering service last year and a backlog of more than 4,000 orders to fill, Boeing has a successful program. It’s not going to proceed with a 737 replacement any time soon.

Boeing needs to get its return on investment on the 737. It’s the 737 and at long last, the 787, that will provide the cash flow necessary to support the company during the transition from the 777 Classic to the 777X and development of the NMA.

But Boeing needs to replace the 737, with a program launch next decade. The old workhorse is on its last iteration and, like it or not, Airbus is and will continue to dominate the single-aisle market. When the new entrants are considered, Boeing has a mere 37% of the single-aisle market share.

The chess game

The chess game between Airbus and Boeing is what makes this business so interesting.

If Airbus launches the A321 Plus alone, what will the affect be on the smaller version of the NMA, the “797-6”? Our analysis shows the economics will be about the same and the A321 Plus will have a much lower capital cost.

What happens if Airbus also launches an A320 Plus and even an A319 Plus? These will put more pressure on the 737-7 and 737-8. Would Boeing then be compelled to launch a 737 replacement before it wants to?

With the Farnborough Air Show coming up, eyes will be on both companies to see what they do. No launch of the 797 is expected this soon—Authority to Offer is more likely in the fourth quarter and a program launch next year, according to our information.

But will Airbus pull the trigger on a preemptive strike and launch the A321 Plus? There are those who think it should—the business case for the NMA, already in doubt for many, would become harder to close. Would it be enough to scare Boeing off the airplane entirely?

Airbus would certainly like to see that, for it has no airplane to serve the upper end of the Middle of the Market sector (the A330-800 is far too much airplane) and doesn’t want to be forced into creating one.

One staffer will be based in Israel full time, while the two others will commute back and forth from Europe.

The office, which is opening as soon as a lease can be signed, will possibly in Tel Aviv. It also will not be an R&D center, contrary to reports last year by business daily Calcalist, which apparently mischaracterized internal Airbus discussions and plans. But “it’s under discussion” whether the company will open a full-fledged office, an industry employee added.Airbus is a European multinational corporation which designs, manufactures and sells civil and military aeronautical products worldwide. The company sees Israel as a top source for hi-tech knowledge and development in expanding the company’s military aviation business.Airbus’s foray into the Israeli market comes on the heels of some 300 multinational corporations already having set up shop in the country. Many of the foreign companies seek to tap into its hi-tech ecosystem – which is home to some 5,000 startups.In contrast to Airbus, its American competitor Boeing has had a long, robust presence in the country. Both companies are tenacious competitors and have created a duopoly in the aviation business.Boeing opened its sprawling Israel office in 1969, and it currently holds space in Tel Aviv and at customer and supplier sites.Boeing Israel’s president is David Ivry, serving in the role since 2003.

The airliner recently acquired 16 new Boeing 787 Dreamliners, with more on the way.It is unclear whether El Al had considered going with Airbus’s planes instead, but until Airbus opens up an office on the size-and-scale of Boeing, it’s unlikely that the European firm can compete for El Al’s business.Established in 1970, Airbus’s civil aerospace business is based in Toulouse, France, while its headquarters are in Leiden, Netherlands.

Future air power - Airbus,"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE4LTA0LWZ1dHVyZS1haXItcG93ZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By connecting a range of manned and unmanned platforms, the Future Combat Air System can help secure European sovereignty and technological leadership in the military aviation sector.

In the past, combat pilots had to do a lot of things by themselves. But times are changing: future air power will be based on a network of intelligent, connected platforms, delivering highly accurate, real-time information.

Airbus and Dassault Aviation have joined forces with the intention of developing and producing Europe’s Future Combat Air System (FCAS). The forward-looking solution will aim to secure European sovereignty and technological leadership in the military aviation sector for the coming decades.

FCAS explained



The FCAS concept comprises a system of systems to connects manned and unmanned air platforms, including a next-generation fighter aircraft, Medium-Altitude Long-Endurance Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), the existing fleet of aircraft such as the A400M and Eurofighter, future cruise missiles, and combat drones flying in swarms. Each component is made smarter by connecting them via satellite constellations and cyber-secured networks. The new fighter aircraft would be at the heart of FCAS, able to control unmanned platforms to autonomously carry out multiple tasks .

Ready for future threats



The global environment is increasingly unpredictable, as are challenges to security. Nations must be able to respond at home, abroad and online against a variety of threats. With FCAS, France and Germany are leading the way by jointly developing the next generation of capabilities.

Roadmap for development



The roadmap is a work in progress. Some technologies will mature earlier and be brought into the current aircraft (Eurofighter and Rafale), some will be tested on prototypes and demonstrators, and implemented when fully mature in the final system. The next generation of fighter aircraft are expected to enter service between 2035 and 2040.

Airbus saw its profits plunge by 30 percent in the first quarter of 2018 due to delays in delivery of its A320neo engines but still plans to supply 800 aircraft this year, the company said Friday.

Its net income dropped to 283 million euros ($342 million) from 409 million euros for the same period last year.

""The first-quarter performance reflects the shortage of A320neo engines,"" Airbus chief executive Tom Enders said in a statement.

""It's a challenging situation for all but based on the confidence expressed by the engine makers and their ability to deliver on commitments, we can confirm our full-year outlook,"" he added.

""This still leaves us with plenty to do this year to reach the target of around 800 commercial aircraft deliveries.""

The European plane maker posted adjusted net earnings of 14 million euros—a better result than the marginal loss forecast by analysts, Bloomberg News reported.

Earlier this month, Airbus announced it would boost production of its A320 aircraft, despite problems in its supply chain.

The A320neo is a more fuel-efficient version of the Airbus company's best-selling airliner, the A320.

The planes are equipped with a new generation of engines and have aerodynamic modifications that allow airlines to save 15 percent on fuel, which is a major operating cost.

The medium-range, single-aisle Airbus aircraft and similarly upgraded Boeing planes have attracted thousands of orders as airlines seek to ensure they remain competitive in the future.

Some 181 A320neo aircraft were delivered in 2017, up from 68 during 2016.

But the new engines have suffered from technical glitches and delays and Enders earlier admitted that ""the A320neo ramp-up remains challenging"".

Airbus has been weakened recently by major corruption investigations in Britain and France, as well as Germany and Austria, that have cast a pall over one of Europe's most successful companies.

It has also faced challenges with the A380 superjumbo, the world's largest civilian airliner, as well as over-budget military transporter A400M.

In March it announced plans to cut around 3,700 jobs on the A380 and A400M programmes.

Also last month, Airbus said it would name a successor to Enders at the end of 2018, as part of a major shake-up of top management.

Airbus launches new Cabin-Flex option for A380 with Qantas - Airbus,"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wNC1haXJidXMtbGF1bmNoZXMtbmV3LWNhYmluLWZsZXgtb3B0aW9uLWZvci1hMzgwLXdpdGgtcWFudGFz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Up to 11 more premium economy seats or seven business class seats

To be available in service from 2019

As part of the efficiency-boosting A380 cabin enablers, Airbus has developed a new option: “A380 Cabin-Flex.” This solution consists in a new cabin door area arrangement on the upper-deck, suitable for premium configuration with lower density seat counts, allowing airlines to gain revenue-earning floor-space for extra seating without compromising on passenger comfort. The enhancement is available either for line-fit and retrofit. Qantas has chosen to be the launch operator of the A380 Cabin-Flex on its current A380 fleet from mid-2019.

A380 Cabin-Flex makes available the extra space for additional seats by allowing the upper-deck at “Doors-3” to be deactivated. Compared with current A380 layouts, A380 Cabin-Flex can bring up to 11 more premium economy seats or seven business class seats. In terms of economics, this translates into a typical return-on-investment (RoI) within around one year for the retrofit solution. The option, is therefore a very effective way to increase the premium seat-count in the upper-deck.

The A380 is the world’s largest, most spacious airliner that offers passengers the smoothest, quietest and most comfortable ride. With two full widebody decks, offering widest seats, wide aisles and more floor space, the A380 has the unique capability to generate revenue, stimulate traffic and attract the passengers, who can now specifically select the A380 when booking a flight via the iflyA380.com web site. Today, 223 A380s are operated by 13 airlines on 60 destinations, and 240 airports can accommodate the A380 around the world.

Airbus is to build passenger sleeping berths inside a plane's cargo hold - CNBC,"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTgvMDQvMTAvYWlyYnVzLXRvLWJ1aWxkLWNhcmdvLWhvbGQtc2xlZXBpbmctYmVydGhzLW9uLWEzMzAuaHRtbNIBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDE4LzA0LzEwL2FpcmJ1cy10by1idWlsZC1jYXJnby1ob2xkLXNsZWVwaW5nLWJlcnRocy1vbi1hMzMwLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European plane-maker Airbus has announced it is to develop lower-deck passenger modules that sit inside the cargo hold.

In a press release Tuesday, the firm said it was partnering with Zodiac Aerospace to build the compartments, complete with sleeping berths for passengers.

Airbus said the intention is to receive formal approval from aviation bodies by 2020 with the first installation to be made on an A330 aircraft.

Geoff Pinner, head of Airbus' cabin and cargo program, said the concept had been received warmly by airlines.

American Airlines Disses Airbus and Orders 47 Dreamliners - Skift Travel News,"Fri, 06 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTgvMDQvMDYvYW1lcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtZGlzc2VzLWFpcmJ1cy1hbmQtb3JkZXJzLTQ3LWRyZWFtbGluZXJzL9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTgvMDQvMDYvYW1lcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtZGlzc2VzLWFpcmJ1cy1hbmQtb3JkZXJzLTQ3LWRyZWFtbGluZXJzL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Once all the aircraft arrive, American will be the largest Dreamliner operator in the western hemisphere, according to Boeing. That's good for customers, considering the aircraft receives the highest customer satisfaction scores of any widebody in American's fleet.

American Airlines has spurned Airbus and placed a major new order for 47 Boeing 787 Dreamliners to replace many of its older long-haul jets, the airline said late Friday.

In announcing the deal, American said it will “terminate” an order for 22 Airbus A350s placed by US Airways, which merged with American in 2013. The A350 fits more passengers than the two Boeing 787 models American ordered, but the aircraft are relatively similar in technology, range and passenger amenities.

American said it will buy 22 787-8s, a smaller version of the popular jet, with deliveries scheduled to begin in 2020. It will also add 25 of the larger 787-9s, and they will begin arriving in 2023. American already flies both jets, and when deliveries are complete the airline said it will have 89 Dreamliners, an aircraft it said consistently receive the highest customer satisfaction scores of any widebody in its fleet.

American’s decision was not unexpected, as executives have said they were considering canceling the A350 order in favor of either the Boeing 787, or the Airbus A330neo. The A330neo is an updated version of an aircraft American already flies.

The deal announced Friday is valued at $12 billion at list prices, but no airline as large as American has ever paid anything close to list price for any order, let alone one of this magnitude. Boeing said the deal will make American the largest Dreamliner customer in the western hemisphere.

Replacing Aircraft

The 787-8s will replace American’s Boeing 767-300s, some of which were delivered in the mid-1990s. The 787-9s will replace American’s older Boeing 777-200s, some of which were delivered in the late 1990s, as well as Airbus A330-300s that once belonged to US Airways.

American President Robert Isom and CFO Derek Kerr have made no secret they prefer a streamlined widebody fleet with fewer aircraft types. That creates simplicity, they have said.

Under American’s fleet plan before Friday, the airline expected to fly five types of widebody jets going forward. It now plans to have operate only three.

“We see significant advantages to carrying common fleet types, including creating less friction in our operation when aircraft swaps are necessary, reducing inventory needs, and creating a more consistent service for customers and team members,” Kerr said in a news release.

As part of the agreement, American said it will defer 40 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft that were to arrive between 2020 and 2022, to “better align with planned retirements of other narrowbody aircraft.”"
New plant puts Alabama at heart of Boeing-Airbus battle - AL.com,"Mon, 02 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMTgvMDQvcHJvcG9zZWRfbW9iaWxlX3BsYW50X3B1dHNfYWxhLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The jet that Airbus and Bombardier plan to build in coastal Alabama isn't a fighter. But to hear some industry sources tell it, it'll be at the center of a coming battle royal.

Airbus and Boeing are so dominant in the commercial jetliner market that they're often referred to as a duopoly. Theirs is a clash of titans, and Mobile stands to be in the thick of it as a new front takes shape over the next few years. It may involve smaller jets, but there's nothing small about the stakes.

The playing field is the market for single-aisle jets that seat from 100 to 150 passengers. Lots of knowledgeable people think the demand is there to make it a lucrative segment. But airlines don't seem to want stubby versions of bigger jets. They're kind of like the car shopper who doesn't want to pay for the light-duty version of a big truck when all he really needs is a small truck.

Continuing that metaphor, the C Series jets that Airbus and Bombardier say they want to build in Mobile could be comparable to the Toyota Tacoma, the best-selling midsize pickup in the country last year, and one of the best-selling pickups overall. Or it could turn out to be more like the truckish Honda Ridgeline, generating a fraction as many sales despite some positive reviews.

Airbus and Boeing have had a healthy sales battle going for years in the category of midsize single-aisle jets, where the state of the art is Airbus' A320 family and Boeing's 737 MAX series.

Each airframe comes in a variety of lengths with different capacities, and seating capacity also varies for any specific model, depending on what the customer wants. But in general, the sweet spot for these jets ranges from 150 to a little over 200 passengers.

A lot of developmental effort seems to be going into the biggest versions, the Airbus A321 and the Boeing 737 MAX 10. Meanwhile, the market for the smallest versions seems to be soft. Airbus figures show no demand for the A318 and relatively little for the A319. A variety of reports suggest that Boeing's forthcoming 737 MAX 7 isn't getting a warm reception, either. Back in January, Bloomberg reported that key customer Southwest Airlines was postponing delivery some orders and changing others to the bigger MAX 8.

""When your most important customer, and the one you probably built the airplane for, doesn't want it anymore, it's a bad day,"" industry analyst George Ferguson told Bloomberg. ""When they defer the 7 ... it means they are trying to figure out if they ever want the 7.""

Enter two smaller players. Canada-based Bombardier and Brazil-based Embraer are big companies but lack the sheer global might of the big two when it comes to manufacturing and marketing their products. They've both got potentially hot new products aimed right at that 100- to 150-seat segment.

Bombardier's C Series was a moon shot for the company, with development costs that reportedly soared far over $5 billion and strained the company's finances. With the CS finally ready to come to market, it faced a fresh challenge: After Delta placed a big order for C Series jets in 2016, Boeing filed a 2017 trade complaint alleging that Canadian government support amounted to an unfair subsidy, allowing Bombardier to drop its prices. Bombardier ultimately prevailed.

Meanwhile, Airbus and Bombardier struck a deal: Airbus would take a majority stake in a new joint venture, the C Series Limited Aircraft Partnership (CSALP). It would throw its muscle behind the production and marketing of the new jet. The two pledged to build a new Final Assembly Line in Mobile, where Airbus already assembles A320-family jets.

Earlier this year, Bombardier and Airbus brought a CS 300 to Mobile. They companies say they will soon build a plant in Mobile to assemble the jetliners, bringing 400 new aerospace jobs to the area. (Lawrence Specker/LSpecker@AL.com)

Some in the industry theorized that Boeing's strategy with its trade suit was simply to capitalize on the idea that Bombardier was on the ropes after struggling to give birth to the C Series. Any more adversity, be it in the courtroom or in the skies, might have left Bombardier unable to market or produce its new product.

In a September 2017 story, The Economist quoted an unnamed ""adviser close to Boeing"" as saying that ""Strangling the baby in the pram may prove rather convenient"" -- in other words, that Boeing might use legal and political means to prevent a competitive product from coming to market. It was a single comment from an anonymous source, but Airbus-Bombardier partisans seized on it as gospel.

Being adopted by Airbus made that child a lot harder to strangle, regardless of who might or might not have been inclined to do so. And talk erupted that Boeing was looking to adopt a youngster of its own: Embraer's E2 family. Three models range in capacity from about 80 seats up to about 150.

A Boeing-Embraer partnership hasn't come to fruition yet. But the E190-E2, seating 97 to 114, received certification in February and is due to enter service this month.

A March 29 Bloomberg report declared the E190-E2's arrival to be ""just a prelude to the bigger battle emerging between heavyweights Boeing Co. and Airbus SE.""

""At stake: possible orders from Air France-KLM, United Continental Holdings Inc., and JetBlue Airways Corp.,"" said the Bloomberg report, which described Boeing as ""deep into talks"" with Embraer. Bloomberg intelligence analyst Ferguson said the E2 jets might have a price advantage, since they're an update of an older family and development costs were far higher for the clean-sheet C Series. The report said several airlines were ""kicking the tires"" on the C Series and E2, prior to possible orders.

To a casual observer, Airbus and Boeing might both look like well-fed animals competing for a snack. But don't be surprised if both fight like they're starving.

Overall, commercial aircraft demand is high: Both Boeing and Airbus have orders in hand for thousands of planes, enough to keep them busy for many years. But that doesn't mean business is good across the board. For example, in early March the Guardian reported that Airbus production cuts were putting 3,700 jobs at risk in France, Germany, Spain and England.

Those cuts were related to the A380 superjumbo, which has found few customers, and the A400M military transport aircraft, and according to the Defense News website, Airbus said it planned to offer other jobs to most of the affected employees. Though the cuts have nothing to do with the single-aisle market, they do help illustrate why aircraft makers remain keenly competitive despite having so many orders in hand.

And both are looking hard at ramping up production for their most popular products, which is a very complex challenge in and of itself. Airbus has said that a possible increase in production at its Mobile FAL could bring 200 more jobs to the area. (The CSALP plant could bring 400.)

Reuters reported in March that also sees increased C Series production as a key part of that line's success. More production means lower costs, and more availability to customers considering orders.

""First we're going to have to sell the aircraft, in order to then work with suppliers on costs of the program, because at the moment there is a gap,"" Airbus procurement chief Klauss Richter said in the Reuters story. ""An increase in productivity rate will help,"" he said.

Boeing likewise wants to ramp up 737 production. But the Seattle Times reported in recent days that it's hampered by supply problems. Another company, Spirit AeroSystems, is having trouble delivering enough fuselage sections, and its problems aren't easily fixed. Boeing said its deliveries haven't been delayed so far.

The bottom line is that the Big Two are energetically trying to make the most of their current successes, while trying not to miss out on emerging markets.

Demand for jets in the 100- to 150-seat range hasn't historically been strong. If it was, A318s and & 737 MAX 7's might be selling like hotcakes. Yet the C Series and the E2 jets exist because smart people think that the market is just waiting for the right product to arrive. They estimate that airlines could ultimately buy thousands of jets in the range.

Who gets the biggest slice of that pie, Airbus or Boeing, comes down in part to who does the best job of selling their jet and who can build them the fastest to fill the orders.

Against that backdrop, the plan to build C Series jets in Mobile isn't merely a business venture. It's likely part of a high-stakes battle in which two global heavyweights will go toe to toe."
Airbus prepares the giant BelugaXL for its first flight - CNET,"Fri, 06 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvdGVjaC1pbmR1c3RyeS9naWFudC1haXJidXMtYmVsdWdheGwtYWlycGxhbmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It's one of the more curious aircraft in the sky, but the Airbus BelugaST is a vital link in the production of Airbus commercial airliners.

Able to swallow fuselages and entire wings of the company's other planes, the Beluga flies parts between Airbus' European factories and its final assembly plants in Hamburg, Germany, and Toulouse, France. It already resembles a bloated termite queen, but this year it's growing even larger with the next-generation BelugaXL.

It's a flying nesting doll: A BelugaST delivers the first nose section of its replacement aircraft, the BelguaXL. Airbus

Airbus tweeted Thursday that it had installed engines on the first BelugaXL in preparation for its flight this summer. The new aircraft (named after the beluga whale, by the way, and not the type of sturgeon) is 20 feet longer than the BelugaST and 3 feet wider. It can accommodate an additional 6 tons in payload.

Watch this: On the road with an Airbus A380 01:06

That bigger capacity (53 tons) will let the BelugaXL fit two Airbus A350 wings (the BelugaST can fit just one) for transport from Wales, where they're built, to Toulouse. It also will carry parts for the Airbus A320 and A330 aircraft families and tall sections for the similarly enormous A380. (Too big to fit in any aircraft, the A380's fuselage and wings are transported by sea and land.)

Like its predecessor, the BelugaXL's design is derived from an older aircraft, in this case the A330. The first BelugaXL rolled out of the Toulouse factory in January, but after a BelugaST had flown the nose section to France.

As a pan-European company, Airbus has long depended on big airplanes as shuttles. Before the BelugaST, it used the Aero Spacelines Super Guppy to ferry sections of its first airliner, the A300.

Back in the US, the Boeing Dreamlifter, an enlarged 747, flies parts of the 787 Dreamliner to the company's final assembly plants in Washington state and Charleston, South Carolina.

Airbus could install bunk-beds on passenger planes by 2020 - Dezeen,"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlemVlbi5jb20vMjAxOC8wNC8xMi9haXJidXMtem9kaWFjLWFlcm9zcGFjZS1idW5rLWJlZC1wYXNzZW5nZXItcGxhbmVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has revealed a series of designs that would transform aircraft cargo compartments into passenger sleeping quarters, complete with bunk-beds and meeting rooms.

Created alongside French company Zodiac Aerospace, the concepts would see the lower decks of planes – more commonly used for cargo – become sleeping berths.

This would be achieved through the use of bunk-bed modules. Each of these modules could be swapped out to make room for cargo compartments, giving airlines more flexibility in where they allocate passengers seats and space.

According to Airbus, the sleeping cabins could be introduced on A330 aircraft as soon as 2020. The two companies are also looking into solutions for the larger A350.

""This approach to commercial air travel is a step change towards passenger comfort,"" said Geoff Pinner, head of Airbus' Cabin and Cargo programme.

""We have already received very positive feedback from several airlines on our first mock-ups,"" he continued. ""We are pleased to partner with Zodiac Aerospace on this project which will introduce a new passenger experience and add value for airlines.""

Christophe Bernardini, chief executive officer of Zodiac Aerospace Cabin Branch, said the project would offer an ""improved passenger experience"" that would become a ""key element of differentiation for airlines"".

Passengers would enter through a ""welcome module"", where they would be greeted at a reception desk. This would lead through to the ""flexible area"", which could be used as a playroom for children, or as a workspace.

A further ""meeting room module"" would feature seating and desks to accommodate working get-togethers. A projector would allow passengers to conduct presentations, or even watch films on a big screen.

Lastly is the sleeping quarters, which Airbus refers to as the ""bunks module"". Here, passengers could sleep in a single bed, with space for clothes and toiletries also provided.

Not all modules would have to be used at the same time. Each could be inserted separately, depending on the needs of the passengers or airline.

This isn't the first time Airbus has come up with an alternative to standard passenger seating.

Previously, the company filed a patent for a detachable passenger cabin designed to speed up embarkation and also revealed a concept for a transparent cabin complete with a virtual golf course.

The most spacious commercial aircraft has received another stay of execution as a Lisbon based carrier, Hi Fly, has decided to enrich its fleet with two used Airbus A380s that formerly served Singapore Airlines.

“Hi Fly is taking delivery of its first Airbus A380, the world’s largest and most spacious airliner,” the Portuguese carrier said in a tweet.

“The arrival is a major event for the company, making it the first Portuguese and the fourth European airline operating the model.”

Between 2007 and 2017 the two double-deck planes were flown by Singapore Airlines, who then returned them to Tarbes Lourdes Pyrénées airport in south-west France once their lease ended.

With the purchase, Hi Fly will join British Airways, Air France and Lufthansa, who are the only European airlines operating the SuperJumbo.

The programme behind the Airbus A380 has been struck by a raft of issues, as the launch of the plane suffered from bad timing. The anticipated arrival of the magnificent aircraft coincided with the onset of the world economic crisis in 2008, affecting the whole travel sector.

Emirates purchased more than a half of the SuperJumbos — VanderWolf Images / Shutterstock

Only 223 SuperJumbos have been delivered out of the 331 total preorders, and almost half of those have been purchased by Emirates.

Airbus has said they would kill the entire project if more sales don’t come.

“If we can’t work out a deal with Emirates, then I think there is no choice but to shut down the programme,” they said in January.

With the materialisation of a second-hand market, Airbus now believes sales of the A380 could be boosted, mainly because of the increased growth of aviation overall and the fact that airport infrastructure is failing to expand, leading to the need of more spacious aircrafts."
[VIDEO] Airbus Reveals New Features of Airspace A320 Cabin - APEX Media,"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vYXBleC5hZXJvL2FydGljbGVzL2FpcmJ1cy1yZXZlYWxzLW5ldy1mZWF0dXJlcy1haXJzcGFjZS1hMzIwLWNhYmluL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aircraft Interiors [VIDEO] Airbus Reveals New Features of Airspace A320 Cabin Share

APEX Insight: Following its launch in March 2016, Airspace by Airbus has rolled out three programs over the last twelve months. Ingo Wuggetzer, VP Cabin Marketing for the OEM, predicts that in five years’ time, thousands of aircraft will be flying with Airspace, and used AIX as a chance to fill people in on its latest developments.

Ingo Wuggetzer, VP Cabin Marketing for Airbus, said during a media briefing that the Airspace cabin is receiving an amazing response on social media, with analysts frequently picking up on the terms ‘spacious’, ‘quiet’, ‘comfort’ and ‘design’. He pointed to a YouTube video posted by Casey Neistat positively reviewing Qatar’s new A350 business class, which has almost six and a half million views. Apparently, Finnair believes Airspace is the reason its net promoter score has reached 50% – the equivalent of three out of four passengers coming back to fly with them again, Wuggetzer explained.

APEX@ is made possible by the support of West Entertainment.

The Airspace cabin has already received much press attention this year following the launch of the A350-1000 with Qatar Airways in February, but that hasn’t stopped Airbus investing heavily in Hamburg. With its largest booth at AIX to date (around 550m²), Wuggetzer claimed the OEM wants to show the industry that Airspace is continuing to ramp up and innovate. Currently on board 160 A350s, Airspace is due to enter service on TAP Air Portugal’s A330s in mid-2018 (two years on from the first mock-up at AIX). In 2020, the Airbus A320 Airspace cabin will launch with JetBlue.

Last year, Airbus confirmed FACC are to supply the ‘Airspace XL bins’ for the Airspace A320 cabin, which AnaÃ¯s Marzo da Costa, head of Aircraft Interiors Marketing at Airbus, says were designed with Priestmangoode to fit eight large cabin bags across two boxes rather than the typical five. Eleven major airlines have already signed up for them, but six remain undisclosed. American Airlines will be the first to install the bins as a retrofit in 2019 before JetBlue launches the linefit version the following year.

At this year’s show, Wuggetzer further revealed that newly-rebranded Diehl Aviation is to supply the sidewalls and is the first of multiple suppliers to be announced for the lavatories. Airbus plans to disclose a lighting supplier in May.

The A320 Airspace cabin mock-up showed off all of the above, plus Hong Kong-based design firm Paperclip’s Butterfly seating concept, which won the Crystal Cabin Award in the Premium Class & VIP category in 2014. The Butterfly seat is easily transformable from two economy-class seats into one business-class seat (which can transform into an 80″ lie-flat bed). Interestingly, Paperclip has launched another animal-themed business class seating concept at AIX this year: The Peacock Suite.

Wuggetzer said the driver behind this choice was the need to provide the comfort associated with wide-body aircraft on single-aisle models, highlighting the transatlantic capability of the A321LR, which completed a flight between Paris and New York on February 13, 2018. During a booth tour, Marzo da Costa said Airbus is still in discussions with seating suppliers, but that should an airline want the product, the OEM can develop it in approximately 27 months.

Another announcement during the Airbus media briefing centered on modularity – the OEM is to launch its new A380 Cabin-Flex solution as a retrofit solution with Qantas in 2019 (but it is also available as a linefit product). By allowing the upper-deck as ‘Door 3’ to be deactivated, the aircraft can hold up to seven more business class seats or 11 premium economy seats. It says introducing the A380 Cabin-Flex solution should result in a return on investment in one year.

Airbus is going to start putting beds in airplane cargo holds - WIRED,"Wed, 11 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9haXJidXMtc2xlZXBpbmctcG9kcy1uYXBzLWNhcmdvLWhvbGQtem9kaWFjLTMzMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"From 2020, Airbus has announced that it will be giving airlines the option of adding even more sleeping areas to its A330 family of aircraft. But there's a catch: you'll have to sleep in the cargo hold.

These spaces will include pre-constructed beds and be separate to the main economy and business class seating areas in planes. There will also be bookable meeting rooms, lounges and areas for children to play. Instead of taking space from established seating spaces, Airbus and supplier Zodiac Aerospace will put the areas below the usual seating classes – in the cargo hold.

Each of the areas will be inside a container that can be slotted into the cargo hold in the same way as traditional cargo is. They will then need to be connected to the aircraft to allow for electricity, water and other services. In theory, it would be possible for an airline to remove or change individual modules when it needed them.

A spokesperson for Zodiac Aerospace, speaking at the Aircraft Interiors Exhibition (AIX) in Hamburg, said it expects them to be removed and changed in around a day. Depending on the size of the aircraft – the A330 comes in a few different lengths – it will be possible to fit three or four new cabins into each plane. In some aircraft, airline crew have similar spaces to the cabins in the cargo hold.

Zodiac says the decision has been made as it has seen the growth in passenger planes carrying cargo slowing, while there is a greater demand for passenger space. Ultimately, it will be up to airlines that buy the cabins to decide how much they will charge but Zodiac says it sees the space as add-ons to someone's ticket. The spaces won't be sold as standalone options – regulations state passengers have to be in seats during take-off, landing and taxiing – but are likely to fall between economy and premium economy prices.

""This approach to commercial air travel is a step change towards passenger comfort,"" Airbus' head of cabin and cargo programme Geoff Pinner said in a statement. ""We have already received very positive feedback from several airlines on our first mock-ups.""

Regardless of whether the idea is useful for passengers or another way for airlines to make money, these cabins won't be flying for some time yet. Zodiac and Airbus say they are currently creating full-size versions and testing will be required before they can be used by customers. At the earliest, they may be used in 2020 or 2021.

In recent years a number of adaptable systems for use inside planes have been announced. At AIX, Lufthansa Technik announced a way for airlines to customise the setups of their craft. The company said it will begin to offer cabin leases, where seats can be changed, added or removed, as and when an airline requires.

However, Lufthansa's offering isn't as flexible as the plans from Airbus and Zodiac. Instead of a one day turn around, Lufthansa's refits will take three months. Jeremy White, the transport director at London-based design firm Seymourpowell, says he expects more customisation and flexibility to come to aircraft in the future.

""You're buying a standard thing that can effectively change and do different tasks depending on the desires and needs of different passengers,"" White explains. His firm has previously developed seating concepts called Flex and morph that allow individual seats to change size and move around a cabin.

But the emphasis on installing these new systems is placed on airlines who are kitting out their planes and attempting to make profit. ""It takes brave airlines to try something new, different and disruptive,"" White says.

Drukair, the flag carrier of the Eastern Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan, has signed a purchase agreement for one Airbus A320neo to support its growth plans and complement its existing fleet of three A319s. The aircraft will be powered by CFM LEAP-1A26E1 engines optimised for high-altitude operations and will become the largest aircraft operating out of Drukair’s base in Paro.

Paro, located at an altitude of 7,300 feet and surrounded by high mountains, is one of the world’s most challenging airports. Thanks to the A320neo’s unmatched performance, it will become the largest aircraft to operate from Paro offering greater payload capabilities and higher passenger comfort levels than any other product.

Featuring a two-class cabin layout, the aircraft will be deployed to increase capacity on existing regional routes to Singapore, Bangkok, Kathmandu, Delhi and Calcutta.

The A320neo Family incorporates the very latest technologies including new generation engines and Sharklets which together deliver at least 15 percent fuel savings at delivery and 20 percent by 2020. With some 6,000 orders received from nearly 100 customers, the A320neo Family has captured some 60 percent share of the market."

Europe's largest aerospace group said it was reducing deliveries of the 250-300-seat long-haul jet to around 50 aircraft in 2019, without giving a figure for its previous plans.

Airbus delivered 67 of the jets in 2017, implying a 25 percent cut in output based on steady volumes this year.

The production setback came as Airbus posted a slender — though better than expected — core profit in the first quarter after delays in engine deliveries for its smaller A320neo.

Together the A320 and A330 families, which feature updated versions of its most successful airframes, generate most of the cash and income needed to support future developments and other activities within the maker of airplanes, rockets and fighters.

Airbus reported an adjusted quarterly operating profit of 14 million euros ($17 million), compared with a restated year-earlier loss of 19 million. Revenues fell 12 percent to 10.119 billion euros. Airbus reaffirmed financial forecasts, however.

Maximising aircraft availability thanks to state-of-the art predictive maintenance



Allegiant Air, WOW air and Small Planet Airlines have signed for Airbus Skywise Predictive Maintenance services. In addition, Primera Air is also officially joining the group of airlines connecting to the Airbus open data platform Skywise. When including the recently announced deal with easyJet, this brings the total number of aircraft to be connected to Skywise to 2,000.

Marc Fontaine, Airbus Digital Transformation Officer said: “I am extremely proud to see that our digital strategy is resonating with an increasing number of our customers. Our vision at Airbus has always been to embark on a collective digital journey as an industry to learn and grow together. This process is allowing us redefine our relationships with customers and suppliers as co-owners of valuable data and insights, which in turn opens up endless exciting opportunities.”

These deals follow the recent announcements with easyJet on Skywise predictive and builds on the network of already connected airlines. In total, 12 airlines are now connected to the platform, including five via the shared value agreement Skywise Core (Bangkok Airways, Peach Aviation, Emirates, Primera, LATAM) and seven via the premium Skywise Predictive Services (easyJet, AirAsia, Asiana Airlines, Etihad Airways, Allegiant Air, WOW air, and Small Planet Airlines).

Laurent Martinez, Head of Services by Airbus business unit said: “I am very pleased to see more of our customers opting for Skywise Digital Services. Our mission in services is to invest in new solutions and discover new territories to bring more value to our customers, and this is exactly what is happening with Skywise. Beyond data analytics and algorithms, the whole point is to unleash the power of collaboration and help our customers improve their operational performances while helping us improve the performance of our fleet.”

Airbus Skywise’s model is twofold:

Skywise Core provides airlines with a cloud-based platform under a “shared value” arrangement: airlines that agree to share operating data from their Airbus fleet can access the platform at no cost. Airlines using Skywise Core can integrate their own operational, maintenance, and aircraft data into the Skywise cloud, so they can store, access, manage, and analyse selected Airbus data together with their own data and global benchmarks without the need for additional infrastructure investments. This resulting value will give them new insights at aircraft, fleet, company, and global levels while allowing them to enhance their operations through access to OEM expertise and global fleet context.

A premium access for enhanced services, e.g. with the Skywise Predictive Maintenance module. Building on Skywise Core, the premium option can be used by airlines to gain deeper insights, create bespoke recommendations and apply state-of-the-art Skywise analytics applications for enhanced decision-making. In turn this will allow them to anticipate, with higher levels of accuracy, the needs for maintenance before an event happens, and thus maximise the operational reliability and utilisation of their assets.

More data means more valuable and accurate insights. Airbus also developed in partnership with Rockwell Collins a new on-board data-capture and transmission module that provides greatly expanded volumes of recorded aircraft data called FOMAX (from only about 400 aircraft parameters up to roughly 24,000 for an A320). The first installation of FOMAX in linefit and retrofit will start in Q2 2018.

Airbus launched the Skywise aviation data platform at the 2017 Paris Air Show, in collaboration with Palantir Technologies – pioneers in big-data integration and advanced analytics. Skywise aims to become the platform of reference used by all major aviation players to improve their operational performance and business results and to support their own digital transformation. In time, Airbus aims to extend Skywise to become aerospace’s data platform of reference, with a service offering adapted not only to the aviation ecosystem but also to defence customers and helicopter operators.

The modules, which would fit inside the aircraft’s cargo compartments, offer new opportunities for additional services to passengers, improving their experience while enabling airlines to differentiate and add value for their commercial operations.

The new passenger modules will be easily interchangeable with regular cargo containers during a typical turnaround if required. Moreover, the aircraft’s cargo floor and cargo loading system will not be affected at all, as the passenger module will sit directly on it.

Christophe Bernardini, Chief Executive Officer of Zodiac Aerospace Cabin Branch said: “We are delighted to work with Airbus on this new and innovative project, which reaffirms our expertise in lower-deck solutions. An improved passenger experience is today a key element of differentiation for airlines.”

Geoff Pinner, Head of Airbus Cabin & Cargo Programme said: “This approach to commercial air travel is a step change towards passenger comfort. We have already received very positive feedback from several airlines on our first mock-ups. We are pleased to partner with Zodiac Aerospace on this project which will introduce a new passenger experience and add value for airlines.”

Airlines will be initially be able to choose from a catalogue of certified solutions by 2020 on A330 for retrofit and line-fit markets. Offerability of sleeper compartments on the A350 XWB airliner is also being studied. The innovation builds on both Airbus’ and Zodiac Aerospace’s experience in producing and integrating lower-deck crew-rest facilities.

Singapore Airlines is set to launch the world's longest flight — and it will be in the air for 19 hours.

Airbus is due to unveil its new A350-900 Ultra Long-Range (ULR) jet later this year, and Singapore will reportedly be the first airline to receive the plane, which had its first test flight earlier this month.

This means that Singapore Airlines plans to connect Singapore and New York by the end of the year, covering a whopping 9,521 miles in 19 hours.

According to Travel + Leisure, the airline plans to operate two classes on the flight — business and premium economy. The plane will also reportedly be ""fitted with lighting to combat jet lag and an air circulation system that renews the air every two minutes.""

The longest flight in the world is currently Auckland, New Zealand to Doha, Qatar with Qatar Airways, which travels 9,032 miles and takes 18 hours, closely followed by Qantas' Perth, Australia to London, England leg, which flies 9,009 miles and takes just over 17 hours.

Singapore has apparently ordered seven of the ULR jets, and will use them to increase its long-haul service, including a non-stop 15-hour flight to Los Angeles starting in 2019."
Engine deliveries affects Airbus 1Q2018 results - Leeham News and Analysis,"Fri, 27 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxOC8wNC8yNy9lbmdpbmUtZGVsaXZlcmllcy1hZmZlY3RzLWFpcmJ1cy0xcTIwMTgtcmVzdWx0cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Bjorn Fehrm

April 27, 2018, ©. Leeham News: Airbus Group presented its 1Q2018 results this morning. It’s heavily influenced by A320neo engine delivery delays.

Only 30 A320neos were delivered during Q1 out of a year total of 400. This has left Airbus with 60 A320neo gliders parked at Toulouse and Hamburg, waiting for engines.

Group results

The Airbus revenue and profit for 1Q2018 were down to €10.1bn (€11.4bn 1Q2017) and €0.01bn (€-0.2bn) as a result of the A320neo delivery problems.

Airbus group headquarters and Commercial aircraft is now merged into a unit called simply Airbus. It dominates the group with 72% of revenue, at €7.2bn (€6.7bn). The helicopters business is still experiencing a weak market with revenue down at €0.96bn (€1.2bn).

Defence is stabilizing at revenue of € 2.2bn (€2.3bn) despite the sale of the US Communications business. The problem child A400M now has a renegotiated delivery plan and expects to deliver 20 aircraft per year from 2020.

Group guidance for 2018 is kept. This does not include the big Joker, the integration of CSeries into Airbus. Integration work is going better than expected and is now expected to close mid-2018. Airbus is planning aggressive sales activities for a “State of the art CSeries line” after the close. The rumoured names for the aircraft once in Airbus are A210 (CS100) and A230 (CS300).

A320

Airbus plans to deliver 600 A320 during 2018 whereof 400 A320neo. This is still the target after a first quarter with only 30 neos delivered of a total of 95. Pratt & Whitney is now delivering engines again after reintroducing the original knife edge seal instead of the troubled updated seal. Both engine manufacturers assure Airbus they will reach the year targets despite initial delays.

The A320 line is now sold out until 2023 and Airbus is studying how to reach rate 70/month or higher after reaching rate 63 next year.

A330

Sales of the A330neo is not going to plan. Airbus will, therefore, reduce from 60 planned deliveries this year to 50 for 2019. The replacement cycle for A330 will then kick in after 2020 and will lift the rate once again, according to Airbus CFO Harald Wilhelm. The 787 Trent 1000 engine problems are not affecting A330neo as it has another version of the Trent 1000 family.

A350

A350 production is running well and Airbus is confident of 10 deliveries per month at end of 2018. The program is on track to be cash positive before 2020.

A380

After securing 20 orders and 16 options from Emirates in the first quarter, the production of A380 at a rate of six per year is now secured well into the next decade.

Celebrating 25 years of Parts By the Hour with DRF Luftrettung - Airbus,"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE4LTA0LWNlbGVicmF0aW5nLTI1LXllYXJzLW9mLXBhcnRzLWJ5LXRoZS1ob3VyLXdpdGgtZHJmLWx1ZnRyZXR0dW5n0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For 25 years, Airbus support and services has been making a significant contribution to the operational readiness of DRF Luftrettung's rescue helicopters, thanks to the security and rate of aircraft availability provided by its HCare Smart contract.

DRF Luftrettung operates over 50 Airbus helicopters for emergency operations at 31 bases in Germany and Austria. Each year the crews take off to more than 38,000 emergency medical services like rapid air rescue and inter-hospital transport of intensive care patients. The prerequisite for this level of activity? Having a helicopter fleet at maximum readiness.

In March 2018, DRF Luftrettung observed a quarter-century of support by Airbus, comprised primarily by a Parts By the Hour contract through the HCare Smart range of services to ensure the short-term supply of spare parts.

Wolfgang Stein, former Technical Manager at the DRF Luftrettung’s Rheinmünster site, recalls the beginnings of the contract: “At first, it was a full maintenance contract. However, as the DRF Luftrettung continued to evolve and became a maintenance operation itself, Airbus adapted its support. This was how a partnership of trust developed over the years.”

“We want to do what we do best [so that] we achieve the best results and the highest possible level of safety,” says Krystian Pracz, Chairman of the DRF Luftrettung. “We could have our own spare parts warehouse. But given the size of our fleet, we had to consider how much the spare parts pool costs us versus the availability that we have directly from the manufacturer. As far as spare parts are concerned, we prefer to rely on reliable and fast delivery by the manufacturer – Airbus.”

DRF Luftrettung’s spare parts needs must take into account a helicopter fleet that includes the types BK117s, EC135s, H135s, EC145s and H145s. “Last year, we placed more than 2,000 orders with Airbus. The total number of parts delivered to us under the PBH contract has been over 38,000,” says Pracz. “The HCare Smart Parts By The Hour contract also ensures our flexibility and operational readiness.""

“DRF Luftrettung was not only the first customer for the H135 and H145, but also a pioneer for the PBH contract,” says Thomas Hein, Airbus Helicopters sales manager for Western Europe, highlighting the positive aspects of the company’s long and successful relationship with the DRF Luftrettung. “This is one of the most successful maintenance contracts that we have with customers today.

Airbus to rename Bombardier C Series the A200: Report - Business Insider,"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXRvLXJlbmFtZS1ib21iYXJkaWVyLWMtc2VyaWVzLXRoZS1hMjAwLXJlcG9ydC0yMDE4LTTSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy10by1yZW5hbWUtYm9tYmFyZGllci1jLXNlcmllcy10aGUtYTIwMC1yZXBvcnQtMjAxOC00P2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is reportedly thinking about renaming the Bombardier C Series.

According to Bloomberg, the C Series may become the A200.

Airbus acquired a 50.1% of the C Series program in October 2017.

In October, Airbus announced the acquisition of Bombardier's next-generation C Series airliner. Now, it looks like Airbus is thinking about renaming its new jet.

The Bombardier C Series may soon be renamed the A200-family, sources told Bloomberg's Benjamin D Katz and Frederic Tomesco. More specifically, the CS100 and CS300 would be redesignated the A210 and A230.

However, the source also told Bloomberg that no formal decision has been made yet.

An Airbus spokesman could not confirm the rumors. However, the company did tell Business Insider that it believes its deal with Bombardier ""will bring tremendous value to the C Series program,"" and that they are ""confident that Airbus can help to make that program even more successful.""

The A200 moniker would allow Airbus to market the C Series with a name that's in line with the rest of its lineup. The renaming of an airliner is far from a common occurrence, but it is something that has happened before. Following Boeing's 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas, MD-95 became the Boeing 717-200.

Airbus acquired 50.1% of the C Series program in October. However, mechanisms within the deal will see the Europe airplane maker take 100% ownership of the C Series program within five years. Airbus made no up-front financial investment in the C Series, but will provide its procurement, marketing, sales, and customer-support expertise. In addition, Airbus also indicated that C Series production would also take place at its plant in Mobile, Alabama.

At the time of the deal, Bombardier was mired in the middle of a trade dispute with Boeing and under threat from a proposed 299.45% tariffed levied upon it by the US Commerce Department. The dispute came about when Boeing alleged that its business was hurt by the low prices Delta received in its 2016 order for 75 C Series jets. According to Boeing, these prices were only possible with the assistance of Canadian Government subsidies. ;

In January, the US International Trade Commission struck the down the proposed tariffs, ending the dispute."
"Startup with SoftBank, Airbus investment planning video constellation with several hundred satellites - SpaceNews","Wed, 18 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9zdGFydHVwLXdpdGgtc29mdGJhbmstYWlyYnVzLWludmVzdG1lbnQtcGxhbm5pbmctdmlkZW8tY29uc3RlbGxhdGlvbi13aXRoLXNldmVyYWwtaHVuZHJlZC1zYXRlbGxpdGVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — A satellite startup that today announced SoftBank, Airbus, Bill Gates and OneWeb founder Greg Wyler as investors says it has plans to field a constellation of hundreds of satellites to provide global video of the Earth, but provided few details on how it will accomplish that goal.

EarthNow spun out of the business incubator Intellectual Ventures last year with a mission to record the planet and provide video in real time to users on the ground. Airbus is the company’s manufacturing partner, using production lines made to build thousands of telecom satellites for OneWeb in Toulouse, France and Exploration Park, Florida.

Russell Hannigan, EarthNow’s founder and chief executive, told SpaceNews the company will provide 20 frames per second video at a “highly competitive” resolution in full color “and a little bit more.”

“We live in a world where people increasingly want immediacy,” Hannigan said. “I want it now, I don’t want it in three or four days time. That’s what we are addressing.”

Hannigan wouldn’t say how much the system will cost, how many satellites will be necessary to start initial service, or when the company hopes to conduct its first launch. Similar to Maxar Technologies’ WorldView Legion constellation, EarthNow is staying very private about the details of its system to keep information away from competitors.

Using the same manufacturing infrastructure as OneWeb to mass produce satellites will help keep costs low, he said. Hannigan described the price of the satellite bus as “the same ballpark price of a 6U cubesat,” but for a much higher quality spacecraft. EarthNow’s imaging payload will drive the cost slightly higher than that of a OneWeb telecom satellite, which is estimated at around $1 million each, he said. Hannigan declined to say who would provide the imaging payload.

“We created the world’s first low-cost, high-performance satellites for mass-production to bridge the digital divide,” Greg Wyler, OneWeb’s founder and executive chairman, said in an April 18 statement. “These very same satellite features will enable EarthNow to help humanity understand and manage its impact on Earth.”

EarthNow says its upgraded version of the OneWeb platform has “more CPU cores than all other commercial satellites combined.” Hannigan said Airbus is building the satellites using an enhanced version of the OneWeb bus produced by OneWeb Satellites, the Airbus-OneWeb joint venture that is building OneWeb’s constellation.

A central challenge for EarthNow will be handling the massive amounts of data its video satellites will capture. Hannigan said the satellites will process data in-situ so that they can “dramatically reduce bandwidth by several orders of magnitude.”

The satellites will also have a more advanced means of parsing desired information from collected video.

“We are not bragging about how much data we collect,” he said. “We’re about trying to get as close to the final answer as the customer wants. We will be able to show you continuous video of a lot of places around the world, but in addition to the video it’s a machine vision system that allows us in real time to extract information from what the imager sees and send that to the user.”

Hannigan wouldn’t describe the EarthNow ground system, which would likely require either numerous ground stations or inter-satellite links to ensure real time data delivery, saying only that “each satellite is connected to the ground at all times.”

EarthNow’s constellation “solves a lot of problems that other companies and approaches are stuck with,” he said. “We get around those problems through our technical innovation and approach. We solved the bandwidth problem, we solved the connectivity problem, and there are other things associated with regulatory that we believe we solved.”

Hannigan said EarthNow is working with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on licensing its constellation. He said NOAA has been “incredibly responsive” in processing the license.

EarthNow plans to target governments and businesses as customers, providing satellite video for applications such as catching illegal fishing, monitoring storms, detecting forest fires and helping boost the efficiency of interconnected “smart cities.” Having Airbus as a partner and investor is advantageous not only from a manufacturing perspective, but also because Airbus operates Earth observation satellites of its own.

“We want to leverage their channels to market,” Hannigan said.

Hannigan said EarthNow has been under development in stealth mode since 2014, and has around two dozen people, partners included, working on it at any given time. Intellectual Ventures where EarthNow started is the same incubator that in 2012 spun out Kymeta, a prominent flat panel antenna company that started shipping its product last year. Hannigan was one of the founders with Kymeta at Intellectual Ventures, he said, but doesn’t see overlap between the two companies."
An Airbus A380 from Singapore Airlines will go to Hi Fly - Business Insider,"Mon, 09 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtZnJvbS1zaW5nYXBvcmUtYWlybGluZXMtaGlmbHktcG9ydHVnYWwtMjAxOC000gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9haXJidXMtYTM4MC1mcm9tLXNpbmdhcG9yZS1haXJsaW5lcy1oaWZseS1wb3J0dWdhbC0yMDE4LTQ_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A380 has found a new airline customer with Portugal's Hi Fly.

Hi Fly confirmed it will acquire a pair of used A380s with the first plane set to arrive this year.

The first Hi Fly A380 is coming off lease after a decade with Singapore Airlines.

The Airbus A380 has found a new home. On Thursday, Lisbon, Portugal-based Hi Fly announced that it will acquire a pair of Airbus A380s.

It will be the first Portuguese and only the fourth European airline to operate the superjumbo after Lufthansa, Air France, and British Airways.

Hi Fly which is known for operating flights on behalf of governments and other airlines has confirmed that it will take delivery of its first superjumbo some time in the middle of 2018.

""It is a very proud moment for Hi Fly,"" airline president Paulo Mirpuri said in a statement. ""The Airbus A380 is the largest and most advanced airliner flying today and certainly the aircraft of choice for the most discerning air travelers. This acquisition has been part of our company’s plans for a while.""

The plane has been in storage since the end of 2017 after being retired from the service.

Hi Fly will retain Singapore's seating configuration which will consist of 399 passengers in economy, 60 in business, and 12 in first class.

The Hi Fly A380 will be powered by four Rolls-Royce Trent 900 turbofan engines and will be equipped with Panasonic seatback in-flight entertainment systems.

A second A380 is expected to arrive sometime next year. An airline spokesperson told Business Insider that the second jet's arrival may be expedited if demand for A380 service exceeds the company's expectation.

The Hi Fly currently operates a fleet of 15 Airbus A330 and A340 wide-body jets. The airline's core business is the wet leasing of airliners around the world. This means Hi Fly will, for a fee, provide the lessee with an aircraft, crew, maintenance, and insurance."
Review: Aer Lingus (A330) Business Class From Dublin to NYC - The Points Guy,"Wed, 11 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9yZXZpZXdzL2Flci1saW5ndXMtYTMzMC1idXNpbmVzcy1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After a great flight on Qatar Airways' first Airbus A350-1000, I needed to make my way back home. TPG grabbed a seat on the airline's nonstop A350-900 flight to JFK, but we were after something a bit more creative for me, so I'd have an opportunity to do another review. The solution: Fly Qatar's Dreamliner from Doha (DOH) to Dublin (DUB) and hop an Aer Lingus A330 — with the new(ish) lie-flat business class — to New York.

Booking

Although Aer Lingus isn't a member of Star Alliance, the carrier does partner with United, and you can confirm award availability on United's site. I kept checking United.com to see if business-class awards would pop up, but they never appeared. Instead, we ended up booking a round-trip from Dublin (DUB) to New York-JFK with the outbound in business and the return in economy for about $1,875.

TPG took advantage of the 50% Pay With Points rebate offered by his Business Centurion Card, redeeming a total of 93,750 Membership Rewards points for the trip. I credited the flight to United, earning 3,179 redeemable miles.

Had we been able to book an award, the best option is via British Airways, since a one-way flight costs just 60,000 Avios. Alternatively you can book for 70,000 miles through United MileagePlus.

Airport and Lounge

Ireland's main international airports — Dublin (DUB) and Shannon (SNN) — offer a unique amenity: US Customs and Border Protection Preclearance. As a Global Entry member, I never have to wait at US immigration, but Preclearance can be a big timesaver for international travelers. It also allows you to arrive as a domestic passenger — in this case directly into JetBlue's airside terminal at JFK.

There's even a new lounge in the Preclearance area, so you can grab a snack and drink once you're on the ""US side.""

I actually prefer this lounge over the Aer Lingus lounge in the main terminal area, so I didn't mind passing the time there until boarding.

The breakfast spread was modest, though, and not especially high-quality.

There were a couple of hot items, but they were honestly pretty gross — the scrambled eggs were crispy and dry, and the avocado was in terrible shape.

I didn't have long to wait before my in-flight meal, though, so I had a couple nibbles and headed to the gate.

Cabin and Seat

This version of Aer Lingus' A330-300 offers a total of 30 lie-flat business seats, arranged in a staggered configuration.

Some seats are far better than others, so be sure to choose carefully!

This cabin has just two ""throne"" seats, which you'll find on a handful of other carriers as well — I had just flown in one on Malaysia's A350, for example.

While I could see which seats were open on ExpertFlyer, unfortunately I wasn't able to make my pick online.

The two thrones were already reserved, so I called Aer Lingus and requested 6A, a window-facing seat on the port side of the plane.

My first picks would be the two thrones — 3K and 5K — followed by 2A, 4A and 6A.

While 6A didn't have quite as much personal space as one of the two thrones, I found it to be especially private, given that it was at the back of the cabin and there wasn't much foot traffic.

The seat didn't have a ton of storage, but I did appreciate the large compartment just above the side table. There was plenty of room for my cables, phone and camera in there.

The seat controls were straightforward, but fairly limited. For example, instead of adjusting the back position my only option was to select one of the presets.

Going into lie-flat mode was cinch, though.

I was also very happy to see that there were dedicated air vents overhead — often an amenity that international carriers seem to either overlook or intentionally exclude.

Amenities and Entertainment

Aer Lingus' small business-class amenity kit had the usual suspects, including a dental kit, eye mask, earplugs, socks and creams. It wasn't exactly a kit I'd toss up on eBay, but it did the trick.

I also got a large pillow and a nice comforter.

The other ""amenity"" was a set of noise canceling headphones, which weren't great.

Aer Lingus' in-flight entertainment system was modern, but the screen was on the smaller side. The content selection was decent, though.

There was also a moving map, of course, which I used to track our progress to New York — as much as I enjoyed this trip, I was pretty eager to get home by that point.

Aer Lingus offers Wi-Fi, but it doesn't come cheap. My 270MB ""Aer Max"" plan cost $33, for example, though you can buy a 120MB package for $16. Minutes after I made my purchase, a flight attendant came through the business cabin with 400MB vouchers — I sure wish I had known those would be coming before I made my purchase! I didn't even end up using all 270MB, though, since the Wi-Fi was exceptionally slow.

Food and Beverage

Just after boarding, a flight attendant came by with a beverage tray, including Champagne, water and juice. I went with a glass of bubbly — Aer Lingus serves Jean Pernet Champagne Tradition Brut NV, which retails for about $30 on the ground.

I had a second glass after departure, which was served with a mix of canapes.

The starter came after that. I was offered a choice of prawn cocktail or a goat cheese salad. Since a feta and yellow tomato salad was listed as the next course, I went with the prawns. The salad was great, but I wasn't a fan of the prawn dish.

Entree choices included a fishcake with sweet chili noodles, chicken with spinach and potatoes or beef fillet with potatoes and gravy. I asked the flight attendant for her recommendation, and she suggested the chicken. I was not disappointed.

Dessert options included a raspberry and white chocolate cheesecake or a selection of Irish cheese. I requested the cheese, which tasted great, even though it didn't look terribly impressive.

At that point I took a nice long nap, before waking up for the afternoon tea service just before landing. It wasn't a full meal, but the chicken pesto and egg salad sandwich slices seemed to do the trick.

I was also served a warm scone with clotted cream and strawberry jam. A flight attendant came through a couple minutes later with more scones, so there was definitely an opportunity to stuff myself full of carbs if I had so desired.

Overall Impression

With less than seven hours of flying time, Aer Lingus biz was a great, no-frills option for getting from Europe to New York City. The food was good, the crew was friendly and there was free Wi-Fi (even though it didn't work very well). Preclearance in Dublin also makes US connections fairly seamless, especially if your next flight is on JetBlue."

Airbus and partners commit to future laminar flow wing research - Aerospace Testing International,"Thu, 26 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZXJvc3BhY2V0ZXN0aW5naW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC5jb20vbmV3cy9mbGlnaHQtdGVzdGluZy9haXJidXMtYW5kLXBhcnRuZXJzLWNvbW1pdC10by1mdXR1cmUtbGFtaW5hci1mbG93LXdpbmctcmVzZWFyY2guaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus ‘Flight Lab’ aircraft, a modified A340-400 (Image: Airbus)

Airbus and several industrial and academic partners have committed to future research on laminar flow wings during a demonstration of the aircraft manufacturer’s Flight Lab testbed at the ILA Berlin Air Show in Germany this week.

The Flight Lab demonstrator aircraft is a modified Airbus A340-400, MSN001, that is currently performing flight tests to assess the feasibility of introducing laminar flow wing technology on commercial airliners.

Airbus engineers believe the use of wings optimized to preserve the laminar flow of air and reduce wing friction could reduce aircraft drag by 10% and lower CO2 emissions by up to 5%. MSN001’s flight tests are part of the BLADE (Breakthrough Laminar Aircraft Demonstrator in Europe) project.

The Flight Lab made its maiden flight in September 2017, fitted with two transonic laminar outer wings, a GKN Aerospace concept with a metallic leading edge, and a Saab concept using carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic.

The test aircraft, which is the first in the world to combine a transonic laminar wing profile with a true internal primary structure, has so far performed 66 flight hours and will continue flying until next year to explore the factors that influence laminarity.

The aircraft is fitted with a flight test instrumentation (FTI) station and is also using a number of firsts in terms of testing technology, Airbus said. This includes the use of infrared cameras to monitor the laminar flow transition points on the wings and an acoustic generator to measure the influence of acoustics on laminarity. Another first is the use of a reflectometry system, which measures overall deformation in real time during flight.

The modifications to the A340-300 testbed aircraft took place over 16 months in Tarbes, France, with the support of the numerous industrial partners across Europe.

The BLADE project is funded by the EU through the Clean Sky project, a €1.6bn (US$1.95bn) research initiative that has been running since 2008. BLADE has involved more than 20 partners and around 500 contributors from across Europe.

Airbus and several representatives from partner organizations signed an accord recognizing the success of BLADE so far and to affirm their desire to build on those successes in the future at the ILA Berlin Air Show this week (April 25-29).

Airbus growth plans developing; could mean Alabama jobs - AL.com,"Thu, 26 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMTgvMDQvYWlyYnVzX2dyb3d0aF9wbGFuc19kZXZlbG9waW5nLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Changes are percolating for Airbus' A320 family of jets and for the new aircraft it plans to build in partnership with Bombardier. Those changes likely will affect Airbus' operations in coastal Alabama, though it remains unknown when and to what extent.

For some time now, Airbus has been considering a global production rate increase for the A320s, which it produces at Final Assembly Lines in Toulouse, France; Hamburg, Germany; Tianjin, China; and Mobile. The Mobile FAL is the newest and in late 2017 reached its initial planned production plateau of 4 jets per month, or Rate 4.

Airbus has thousands of orders in hand for its single-aisle jets and has been gradually increasing A320 production in recent years. A variety of industry reports peg its current output at 55 jets a month, but speculation about the eventual target rate has varied.

In recent days, reports have zeroed in on a rate increase to 63 jets a month, to be accomplished in 2019. According to reports by Reuters and the New York Times, France's La Tribune reported that a company spokesman had confirmed this plan. However, it does not appear that Airbus has released an official statement to that effect.

In January, industry publications reported that Airbus had struck a formal agreement with Chinese authorities to raise production from Rate 4 to Rate 5 by early 2019 and to Rate 6 by early 2020.

That could be a pattern repeated at the Mobile FAL: There have been suggestions since the start of production that it could eventually go beyond Rate 4. If so, it likely would mean significant hiring. During a February appearance in Mobile, Jeff Knittel, CEO of Airbus Americas, said there was a ""high likelihood"" that production in Mobile could increase to Rate 6. If that happens, he said, the FAL's workforce likely would increase from about 400 people to about 600.

However, on Wednesday an Airbus spokesperson cautioned that no specific production change for Mobile has been confirmed. Kristi Tucker, director of communications for Airbus Americas, said it was ""no secret"" that a rate increase was being considered, ""but nothing has been decided or announced yet.""

There is a potentially serious stumbling block: For Airbus to build more jets, its suppliers have to deliver more components. That could be a problem, particularly when it comes to engines. One engine supplier, Safran (a partner to General Electric), expressed doubts. Reuters quoted Chief Executive Philippe Petitcoin as saying, ""As of today, we are not in a position to commit ourselves to higher volumes.""

Pratt & Whitney, the other engine supplier for A320neo jets, has had some teething problems with its new engines, but the company has maintained that the issues are being overcome and production won't be limited by them.

Broadly speaking, Boeing is facing similar circumstances with its single-aisle 737 family: It too has thousands of orders on hand, would like to increase production, but has to overcome possible supply-chain limitations.

Meanwhile, there's also news on another front, the Bombardier C Series jets that Airbus and Bombardier want to jointly build in a new FAL planned for Mobile.

That joint venture, the C Series Aircraft Limited Partnership (CSALP), has been working toward the governmental approval needed before it can go into effect. Reuters reported Wednesday that the deal could be closed by the end of May. Company officials previously had said they hoped to reach that milestone in the summer.

That would mean executives could quit speaking hypothetically of the planned new Mobile FAL and start unveiling specifics such as a construction timetable. Once complete, it'll join a Canadian site in producing the CS100 and CS300 -- though they may not be called that anymore.

Bloomberg reported Tuesday that Airbus, which hold a slight majority stake in CSALP, may rename the C Series to match its own nomenclature. The C Series could become the A200 family, with the CS100 and CS300 becoming the A210 and A230.

Knittel said in February that if a new FAL is indeed built in Mobile to produce the C Series jets, it could employ 400 people. In conjunction with a rate increase at the existing FAL, that would mean 600 new aerospace jobs.

Though it seems the sky is the limit, with some industry sources speculating that Airbus' global A320 production eventually could rise to 70 per month, a March analysis at Forbes.com offered a cautionary note. Contributor Richard Aboulafia wrote that the current raging demand for new single-aisle jets, and the pressure to ramp up production, ""is based on an almost perfect confluence of market conditions.""

Favorable factors include a long-term trend of growth in the U.S. economy, moderate fuel prices, low interest rates, high demand for air travel and -- despite a global trend of protectionism -- a lack of trade barriers affecting the aircraft market. ""Things are almost impossibly perfect right now,"" Aboulafia wrote."

The sleeping quarters are built as modules that can be interchanged with regular cargo containers and will not impact the cargo loading systems.

The renderings released by the companies show the sleek lower deck modules’ sitting areas, pod beds, and work spaces. But the designs also go beyond bunk beds: The initial sketches include plans for play areas for children and families, medical care zones, lounges, and conference rooms.

The Airbus A330 forms part of the fleets of numerous airlines worldwide, including American Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, Delta, and Alitalia. Airlines will be able to customize the modules to fit their brand and passenger needs. “This approach to commercial air travel is a step change towards passenger comfort,” Geoff Pinner, head of Airbus’s Cabin & Cargo Program, said in a statement. But passengers will have to keep reclining their seats for the time being: The modules won’t be available until 2020."
Airbus-built MetOp-C Weather Satellite Gets Ready for Launch - Space Ref,"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VyZWYuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2UvYWlyYnVzLWJ1aWx0LW1ldG9wLWMtd2VhdGhlci1zYXRlbGxpdGUtZ2V0cy1yZWFkeS1mb3ItbGF1bmNoL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The MetOp-C meteorological satellite is getting ready for upcoming launch in order to join its siblings and further improve the quality of observations and data provided for weather forecast.

Built by Airbus, MetOp-C is the last of the first generation of EUMETSAT Polar System (EPS) series of three polar-orbiting satellites, and is planned to be launched on September 18, 2018, from European Space Center in Kourou, French Guyana, aboard a Soyuz rocket.

The MetOp programme has enhanced the accuracy of weather forecasting and allowed extending the short term forecasts by one day.

“MetOp satellites are technologically advanced and their instruments are still state-of-the-art,” said EUMETSAT Director-General Alain Ratier. “We are in the fortunate and unexpected position soon having three MetOp’s in orbit at the same time, because MetOp-A, which was launched in 2006, has exceeded its five-year design life time by far and will remain in orbit until 2022.”

“Building on the successful operation and exceptional longevity of the MetOp satellites, we are still happy to have been entrusted the preparation of MetOp-SG, the next generation of Low Earth Orbit Meteorological satellites for EUMETSAT and ESA”, said Mathilde Royer Germain, Head of Earth Observation, Navigation and Science at Airbus, during a presentation of the satellite to the press.

The MetOp satellites have been developed by Airbus Defence and Space for the European Space Agency (ESA) and EUMETSAT, the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites, and are part of a joint Europe-US cooperation.

Initially, the plan was for each satellite to replace its predecessor, however, the excellent performance of the first two MetOp satellites allows them to be operated simultaneously, providing the meteorological community with increased data. The forthcoming launch of MetOp-C will further improve the quality of observations and data provided for weather forecasts.

Each MetOp satellite carries a total of 12 instruments (10 for MetOp-C), making the system extremely versatile. Two of the instruments have been built by Airbus: the Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) and the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT). The MHS, built by Airbus, measures water vapour near the Earth’s surface and is a result of the collaboration with the US.

Two additional microwave humidity sounders are already flying on US NOAA satellites, delivering matching data from a different orbit to enhance weather models.

The other Airbus-built instrument, the “Advanced Scatterometer” (ASCAT) is an active radar instrument which measures wind speed and direction over the open sea. It also provides data for ice and snow coverage as well as surface moisture. ASCAT will scan two 500 kilometres wide corridors and can, therefore, provide almost global coverage within 24 hours.

MetOp also measures ocean surface winds, observes sea ice distribution and monitors the ozone layer in the stratosphere, as well as relaying meteorological measurements collected by boats, buoys and research stations. MetOp A and B also feature a receiver to relay signals sent by persons in distress.

In addition to the expected benefits on weather forecasting, MetOp-C will continue the time series of data begun by MetOp-A, and this long-term outlook is crucial for climate monitoring.

Under development at Airbus, the MetOp-SG will provide continuity and enhancement of meteorological data with improved spectral and spatial resolution compared to the measurements currently provided by the first generation of MetOp satellites. A complete range of observations will be realised using 10 different instruments, covering ultra-violet, visible, infrared and microwave spectral bands.

From 2021 onwards, MetOp-SG will further increase the benefits of accurate weather prediction based on state-of-the-art European technologies and keep contributing to socio-economic benefits worth several billion Euros for European citizens.

Airbus turns aircraft cargo bays into spacious sleeping berths - New Atlas,"Wed, 11 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1haXJjcmFmdC1jYXJnby1zbGVlcGluZy1iZXJ0aHMvNTQxNDkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sometimes air travel is so cramped that we grumble that they might as well put passengers in the cargo hold. It seems that Airbus has heard this and plans to do so – in a good way. In partnership with Zodiac Aerospace, Airbus is developing a modular system that will allow airlines to change their cargo bays into sleeper compartments for long-haul flights, complete with spacious bunks and other amenities.

If you look at old adverts for air travel from the 1940s and '50s, you may have come across interior views of the old China Clippers and Stratoliners with their lower decks containing Pullman-style sleeping accommodations, lounges, and even piano bars. Despite many efforts to revive these bits of gracious living in the skies, the jet age has ended up with amenities that often leave a lot to be desired – especially on long overseas flights when even the most palatial first class seat can seem like a convict transport cell after 14 hours.

Airbus and Zodiac are developing a modular system that by 2020 will allow airlines operating the Airbus A330 and, one day, the Airbus A350 XWB to change surplus cargo bays into sleeping accommodations. That may sound like you're going to be bunking with the pet crates, but the idea is a much more attractive. Long haul airliners already have surprisingly spacious crew accommodations tucked away below decks or in odd corners of the airframe that the paying customers are never aware off. This simply takes the idea one step further.

The Airbus concept includes the potential for conference room facilities, complete with wraparound wall screens, tucked away below deck Airbus

The partners haven't released too many details, but Airbus says that the modules will fit inside existing cargo compartments, can be swapped out easily, and will not interfere with normal cargo operations. In addition, Airbus has released a photo of the sleeping module mock up and concept drawings of modules that contain child play areas, a medical bay, a lounge, and a conference room complete with wraparound wall screens.

Airbus has unveiled their latest answer to aircraft maintenance at MRO Americas – a UAV known as the Airbus Advanced Inspection Drone. The tool has been designed with the intention of significantly reducing aircraft downtime, by speeding up visual checks and increasing the quality of inspection reports.

This new product, which takes advantage of Airbus’ extensive aircraft knowledge and combines it with best-in-class drone technology, is made up of an autonomous drone with an integrated photo camera, obstacle detection laser sensor, and flight planning software. By utilising Airbus’ proprietary aircraft inspection software analysis tool, the autonomous drone folows a predefined inspection path, capturing required imagery with its built-in camera. By transferring high quality pictures to a PC database for detailed analysis, the operator can then localize and measure visual damage on the aircraft’s surface by comparing it with the aircraft’s digital mock-up and generate an inspection report.

This drone-based aircraft inspection system has been developed in co-operation with Airbus’ subsidiary Testia, and has been in particular designed for inspecting the upper parts of the aircraft fuselage. It will be available for the industry in late 2018, once it has achieved EASA approval for this innovative inspection process. Several airlines which have expressed interest following initial demonstrations by Airbus, and the tool is expected to also be offered to MRO organizations.

In order to operate safely within maintenance hangars, the Airbus Advanced Inspection Drone is equipped with a obstacle detection laser sensors which halt inspections if mitigation of damage and danger is required. This technology allows the vehicle to fly autonomously, which means less man-hours on the ground.

By upgrading to the new drone-based hangar maintenance system, operators and MRO providers will be able to reduce inspection time, which will also allow faster turnaround of the aircraft for flight. Higher quality reports will in turn mean improved damage localization, repeatability and traceability. Compared to traditional aircraft visual inspection, which could typically last up to one day, this new inspection process can take a very short three hours, including 30 minutes of image capture by the drone.

The Airbus Advanced Inspection Drone makes up part of Airbus’ ‘Hangar of the Future’ (HoF), which is an innovation maintenance project begun initiated by Airbus Singapore in 2016. HoF brings together innovative technologies and smart IoT equipment, including ‘cobots’ (collaborative robots), drones, cameras, scanners and non-destructive sensors, with aircraft technical documentation and aircraft in-service data collected by Airbus’ open data platform, Skywise. Through the digitization and automation of maintenance activities, Airbus says it ‘is responding to the increasing maintenance needs of airlines with growing fleets, creating value for all stakeholders’.

Tornado successor: Team Eurofighter presents offer to Germany - Airbus,"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wNC10b3JuYWRvLXN1Y2Nlc3Nvci10ZWFtLWV1cm9maWdodGVyLXByZXNlbnRzLW9mZmVyLXRvLWdlcm1hbnnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Munich, 24 April 2018 – On the eve of the ILA Berlin Air Show 2018, Airbus and Eurofighter GmbH have submitted their offer to the German Ministry of Defence for a replacement of the Bundeswehr’s ageing Tornado combat aircraft, which was developed in the 1960s, and have established the Eurofighter as its ideal successor.

Currently, the German Air Force is planning to phase out the Tornado from 2025 onwards and to transfer capabilities to another weapon system. As the Eurofighter system is already in use by Germany, this system could seamlessly adopt the capabilities of the Tornado aircraft. In addition, increased use of the same type of aircraft would result in considerable cost savings in terms of support services and training costs due to economies of scale, which would also reduce per-hour flying costs within the German Armed Forces.



“The Eurofighter is already the backbone of the German Air Force and is therefore the logical option to adopt the capabilities of the Tornado in the medium term,” said Bernhard Brenner, Head of Marketing & Sales at Airbus Defence and Space. “We have an excellent aircraft, its production secures important aircraft construction know-how in Germany and, at the same time, strongly supports European sovereignty in defence. The successful continuation of Eurofighter production could also lead to further cooperation with other European nations such as Switzerland, Belgium and Finland.”



Volker Paltzo, Eurofighter Jagdflugzeug GmbH CEO, said: “I am confident that Eurofighter Typhoon can provide a cost effective and attractive solution for Germany, which will deliver every capability and perform every mission the German Air Force needs.”



In the medium term, the further development of the Eurofighter will provide the technological basis for the next generation of European combat aircraft. The intent of collaboration was agreed between France and Germany in July 2017 and these aircraft are currently expected to enter into service around 2040.



In the UK, Eurofighter is already increasingly taking over the tasks of the Tornado, as the Royal Air Force has decided to retire its Tornado fleet in 2019.



The Bundeswehr currently operates 130 Eurofighters and 90 Tornados. The German Air Force’s fleet of combat aircraft is used both for missions to secure airspace sovereignty over Germany and in international NATO alliance missions around the world.

Airbus celebrates 50th anniversary of the trademark Fenestron - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1cy1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLTUwdGgtYW5uaXZlcnNhcnktdHJhZGVtYXJrLWZlbmVzdHJvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On April 12, 1968, the first Fenestron took to the skies on the second prototype of the Gazelle. It has since become emblematic of Sud Aviation, Aerospatiale, Eurocopter and now Airbus Helicopters, with the H160 carrying this sound-reducing, safety-enhancing technology into the next generation of rotorcraft.

The idea behind shrouding the tail rotor was initially developed to provide additional safeguards for workers on the ground, but also to protect the tail rotor in forward flight and in complicated operational environments, such as working around high-voltage power lines.

Sound reduction benefits followed after much research and optimization from one generation of the Fenestron to the next.

Originally called the “Fenestrou,” which is Provençal for “little window,” the term evolved into the renowned Fenestron. It was first certified on the Gazelle in 1972 and then subsequently integrated into the first single-engine Dauphin prototype, whose first flight was in June 1972.

Trials were then conducted with a seven-tonne Puma in 1975; however, with its diameter of 1m60 and its 11 tail rotor blades, it required too much power for the Fenestron to bring an operational advantage on this class of helicopters.

The second generation came at the end of the 1970s with an all-composite Fenestron, which increased the diameter of the new Dauphin’s Fenestron by 20 percent up to 1m10. This improvement was motivated by the U.S. Coast Guards’ requirement for a highly maneuverable aircraft for search-and-rescue operations.

The U.S. Coast Guard’s aircraft are still in service today and have accumulated more than 1.5 million flight hours.

In the meantime, research continued to optimize the shape of the Fenestron, blade foils, and to improve sound reduction, especially during certain phases of flight. Between 1987 and 1991 it was successfully tested on an Ecureuil, the prototype of which is still on display at the entrance to Airbus Helicopters’ headquarters in Marignane.

In 1994, the third generation was fitted onto the H135 and optimized sound levels by using an uneven setting of the blades.

In 1999 the H130 performed its maiden flight with a Fenestron derived from this version. The H145 followed suit in 2010.

Fifty years on, the H160 possesses the latest and largest Fenestron to be built on an Airbus helicopter with a diameter of 1m20. The fact that it is canted to 12 degrees allows for improved performance with an additional payload and increased stability — especially at low speed.

With the H160 out to conquer the medium twin market, the Fenestron will be one of Airbus Helicopters’ signatures in the skies for decades to come."

With the investment in one new Airbus A330E, SAS improves its customer offering as SAS’s entire long haul fleet will have an identical cabin interior. In addition, the Airbus A330E has approximately 15-20% lower jet fuel consumption per seat kilometer compared to the Airbus A340 that will be replaced.

The list price of one A330E aircraft, including engines, ordered from Airbus amounts to MUSD 264, before discounts agreed between SAS and Airbus. The new Airbus A330E will be financed through a sale/leaseback.

In accordance with the other A330E, SAS has chosen RR Trent 772B as engine."
Learning to Innovate with Louise Kyhl Triolo at Airbus - Chief Learning Officer,"Mon, 23 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWVmbGVhcm5pbmdvZmZpY2VyLmNvbS8yMDE4LzA0LzIzL2xlYXJuaW5nLXRvLWlubm92YXRlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In 2000, Louise Kyhl Triolo was a fresh-faced, newly minted master’s program graduate in Copenhagen, helping fellow Danish citizens find jobs through her role as an outplacement consultant, when she made the decision to move to Paris.

“I wanted to know what it was like to work in a business, and I wanted to do that in Paris because I loved France and knew how to speak French,” she said. So the enterprising 25-year-old packed up and moved, giving herself three months to find employment in the City of Lights. On the final day of her sojourn, she landed an interview — and ultimately a job — with L’Oreal.

Over the next 15 years, two more bold moves followed, first to the south of France for a position with Airbus Helicopter and then, two years ago, to Silicon Valley to head up leadership development, culture innovation and the North American Leadership University for Airbus, joining a newly created team of three in a small office in Mountain View, California. Kyhl Triolo got the job by writing a white paper explaining why the new team would need someone like her.

A deeply ingrained entrepreneurial spirit, outside-the-box thinking and willingness to take risks have made Kyhl Triolo a dynamo in the learning field today, earning her the title of “one of the most creative people I have ever known” from her boss, David Fink, vice president of human resources for Airbus Group.

“Louise is brilliant. Her thinking is far beyond,” Fink said. “We love having her on our team because she will always say something that no one else has really thought of, including myself. And it’ll make us think more creatively about what we’re doing and why we’re doing it.”

In With the New

Kyhl Triolo traces her interest in the learning industry to that first job as an outplacement consultant, where she saw firsthand how important it was for workers to continually learn and develop in order to stay relevant and employable.

“I discovered that people who had 25, 30 years of experience in the same company, the day they were laid off, suddenly lost everything — their identity, their confidence, their self worth. They didn’t know who they were or what to do,” she said. “That’s where the desire to develop and grow people stems from. [This then expanded] to see if we can help organizations evolve and renew themselves and innovate and create the conditions for people to bring their best selves to work.”

In an industry like aeronautics, where fast-paced technological advancements, creative business models and new market players like Elon Musk’s SpaceX have set the stage for major disruption, the ability to adapt and refresh has never been more important.

“You’ve got to move fast. And if you don’t, you’re going to fall behind quickly. And if you fall behind, you may not be able to ever catch up,” said Alex Veneziano, legal counsel for Airbus, who has taken several leadership development courses designed and helmed by Kyhl Triolo.

“The disruption that can occur is occurring — and it can have a significant impact to our business,” Fink said.

To come out on top, Airbus is reinventing itself. The company, which has more than 130,000 employees across 180 locations worldwide, has operated for decades as “a very structured engineering company that engineers everything,” Fink said. But that’s about to change.

“We are moving from this control-and-command organization to a much more open and networked organization,” Kyhl Triolo said. “We’re activating a sustainable cultural change, helping our leaders change their mindsets and ways of working. We’re really trying to create and infuse an entrepreneurial spirit inside the organization.”

In fact, Kyhl Triolo’s team at Airbus was created to help the organization “disrupt itself,” according to Fink.

“Learning is the key to making that change happen,” Kyhl Triolo said. “It’s driven through people.”

Instilling Change

Igniting and sustaining a cultural change is no easy feat, however. Kyhl Triolo has set about creating a multilayered series of initiatives to help her accomplish her goal.

These include a nine-month transformational leadership program for all 2,500 managers in the organization; a partnership with Stanford University to offer online leadership development courses; virtual coaching for leadership transitions; better support for remote leadership situations through the use of artificial intelligence — specifically, a “beamer,” which projects a 3D mobile avatar into the room for a more realistic experience; executive trips to Silicon Valley so that leaders “get to touch, feel and experience the culture that is here,” according to Kyhl Triolo; and her biggest achievement to date: the “Dream Big” challenge.

Inspired by the XPrize Foundation, which leverages the collective wisdom of people around the world to help solve some of humanity’s most pressing problems, Dream Big is a companywide contest for ideas and solutions to the organization’s biggest market challenges.

“I said, ‘At Airbus we have 135,000 talented people. Why don’t we tap into this huge wisdom [pool] to come up with solutions and ideas for solving

our big challenges for the future?’” Kyhl Triolo said. “A lot of people are buried under bureaucracy. It’s freeing up this whole potential.”

So last September, she and her colleagues launched the incentive challenge, which drew 700 ideas from employees all over the world. Each idea was presented in a one-minute video, and Kyhl Triolo and her team selected 150 finalists to attend a learning summit, with three ultimate winners earning a trip to Silicon Valley; Shenzhen, China; and Bangalore, India. The winners were also granted the opportunity to incubate their ideas for three months.

“It generated so much energy,” Fink said. “For a very large, somewhat bureaucratic company to do something that forward thinking and have our leaders engaged — that was because of Louise.”

The Dream Big initiative dovetails with a methodology Kyhl Triolo is working to instill into the organization called “think wrong,” which derives from a book titled “Think Wrong: How to Conquer the Status Quo and Do Work That Matters.” The book proposes novel frameworks and tools to come up with creative solutions to existing problems.

“We use [it] to help us break away from the status quo and current culture and come up with unexpected, innovative results to our business challenges,” Kyhl Triolo said.

Building Relationships

According to many who have worked with her, Kyhl Triolo is the perfect person to be spearheading these groundbreaking initiatives.

“She has this real liveliness about her,” said Dena Anderson, manager of industrial engineering and continuous improvement at Airbus in Grand Prairie, Texas, who recalls a recent experience working with Kyhl Triolo to hire trainers for the company’s leadership university.

“After we did each interview, we had a little debrief among the four or five of us who were [hiring]. She had some really interesting perspectives,” Anderson said. “It made me think when I was looking at the next candidate who came in the room — and even when I do interviews now for hiring other people onto my team. That’s probably the biggest thing that I’ve learned from her.”

“Louise is very high energy,” added Veneziano. “And because she’s a true believer, and she’s so high energy, it’s infectious working with her. She makes it kind of obvious that this is the way of the future, so it’s time to get on board.”

Fink said Kyhl Triolo is also a talented relationship builder — a critical skill for bringing about cultural change at a legacy company like Airbus.

“Louise is one of the most compassionate human beings. She’s just very approachable,” Fink said. “She connects with people so easily at any level. It doesn’t matter if they’re the CEO or head of a division or a first-line manager. She treats people the same no matter who they are.”

“She’s really focused on the people,” said Anderson. “I think it’s quite personal for her. She doesn’t just see a number. She doesn’t say, ‘OK, I have a training goal where I need to make sure that 500 people are trained in North America this year.’ To her, I feel like it’s more about the change that it makes in people and how it helps their development.”

Indeed, Kyhl Triolo said too often organizations send their employees to training courses simply to tick a box.

“Organizations have a tendency to just send people off to a two-day course and then say, ‘Oh, good. Now the person has learned something,’ and then go back to their jobs,” she said. “That’s just not how it is.”

She believes learning should be constant, experiential and “totally integrated into how you work, how you live your life, how you drive your goals.” It’s a philosophy that’s partly influenced by her Danish upbringing.

“There’s actually a word in Denmark — arbejdsglæde — that doesn’t exist in any other language. It means happiness at work,” she said. “It’s still, for me, an overarching goal of how I see life, how I see work and how I should be.”

Current Success and Future Challenges

Kyhl Triolo’s learning and leadership development courses consistently receive a four or five out of five in survey feedback, but she said the most satisfying results are those that bring about real change. For example, in 2017 she ran an executive master class around agile leadership that brought together North American leaders to work on relationship building and tackle current business issues.

“What came out of that was a discovery that there needed to be more work happening around identity, strategy and vision for Airbus in North America,” she said. “You’re getting people together to learn how to work differently together and create relationships, and the outcome ends up being, ‘Hey, we need to have a clarified strategy and vision and identity.’ For me, there could not be a better outcome.”

Her creative mission doesn’t come without hurdles, however. While building initiatives from scratch is Kyhl Triolo’s specialty, it’s also one of her greatest challenges.

“You don’t really have anything except for a white piece of paper and someone telling you, ‘You tell us what to do.’ That’s a massive, massive challenge,” she said.

On top of that, getting executive buy-in — “so that they support you in the right way” — is particularly daunting when it comes to new and untested projects. But Kyhl Triolo has a knack for connecting, for inspiring leaders to think differently, Fink said. “It’s not easy in this company where you’re up against a lot of engineers who have been doing their work [the same way] for a long time.”

“We used to be very hierarchical and bureaucratic,” Veneziano said of Airbus. “That’s gone. I don’t feel like I’m going to offend somebody or put my own career at risk by raising a unique way of working or by trying to move faster than people seem comfortable with. I think [Louise] has done such a good job of exposing this mindset to the people who run the company that it lets people like me operate freely. She has been very effective at pushing a culture change.”

Despite all this success, for Kyhl Triolo it’s just the beginning.

“Because of our capacity to bring people together and because of our outreach in the organization … we are instigators of innovation,” she said of her fellow learning professionals. “We can really, truly contribute to innovating — and the future of the company.”

jetBlue's CEO Might Be The First Airline Executive To Admit Airbus' Space Flex Galley Isn't Good For Crew - paddleyourownkanoo.com,"Mon, 02 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYWRkbGV5b3Vyb3dua2Fub28uY29tLzIwMTgvMDQvMDIvamV0Ymx1ZXMtY2VvLW1pZ2h0LWJlLXRoZS1maXJzdC1haXJsaW5lLWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS10by1hZG1pdC1haXJidXMtc3BhY2UtZmxleC1nYWxsZXktaXNudC1nb29kLWZvci1jcmV3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For pretty much everyone, apart from airline shareholders perhaps, Airbus’ Space-Flex combined galley and toilet system doesn’t seem like a positive change for the passenger experience, does it? For those of you who aren’t in the know, the Space-Flex system is a redeveloped galley on short-haul Airbus A320 family single-aisle aircraft that more and more airlines – both low-cost and full-service – are installing on their new and existing planes.

This might not sound all that important – after all, how can a galley affect your travelling experience that much, you ask? But it turns out, that when space is already a premium on Airbus’ smallest family of aircraft, the Space-Flex galley system may well be twisting the screw just that tiny bit too far.

On older A320 aircraft the rear galley takes up the whole back wall of the passenger cabin. Then, just forward of the rear passenger doors come the lavatories on either side of the aisle and eventually, the passenger seating starts. The Space-Flex system, however, aims to maximise as much space in the existing shell of the cabin to add extra passenger seats.

So, the size of the galley is reduced by half and the lavatories are squeezed into the remaining space on the back wall of the cabin. Voila, you’ve suddenly made space for two, or maybe even three, extra rows of seating – depending on how tight you want to make the pitch. All within the same aircraft frame as before.

On the face of it, the Space-Flex system shouldn’t have too much of an effect on the average passenger journey – especially the more forward of the cabin you’re sat. But don’t be fooled into thinking there aren’t any effects – just ask any member of cabin crew who has worked on one of these aircraft.

For many flight attendants, their biggest gripe is the lack of space to do their job. They struggle to set up service items or to find things that are now hidden away. And of course, they’re now sharing their workspace with passengers who are waiting to use the lavatory – the overall effect is that service is considerably slower than what it once was.

Speaking of the lavatories – they’re smaller than the standard toilets you’ll find on most planes (and you thought they were already small enough). There are stories on passengers having to back themselves in for the lack of space, while other passengers have become stuck due to the tight width.

Not that the problem is unique to European aircraft manufacturer Airbus – its arch-rival, Boeing has developed a similar concept for its popular single-aisle 737 aircraft. The extra small sinks and reduced room to manoeuvre have drawn ire from American Airlines flight attendants who complained about the design to company Chief Executive Doug Parker.

Then there’s the fact that with extra passengers onboard, getting everyone on and off, as well as completing the service, all take longer than what it once did. Overall, this seemingly small change could have a big impact on your journey.

Not that either Airbus or the airlines buying the system are going to admit that. Airbus simply says space has been “optimised” and claims the system allows “high service levels to be maintained.” In fact, the design in Space-Flex V.2 which has been flying since May 2016 includes a lavatory for passengers with reduced mobility (PRM).

We’ve known that some airlines haven’t been entirely convinced about the benefits of Space-Flex. A couple of years ago, an unnamed “major airline” reportedly “killed” plans to install Space-Flex after finding that “no group other than finance was enthusiastic about it.”

Yet, that was a couple of years ago and much has changed in that time. It’s not just low-cost airlines like easyJet who have taken to retrofitting their fleet with Space-flex. Both Lufthansa and British Airways – two major and supposedly premium European airlines – have embraced the system.

Reports out of the U.S., however, suggest that some airline executives will go ahead with Space-flex while acknowledging the fact that service standards might decline and cabin crew will invariably have a tougher job on their hands.

Robin Hayes, the chief executive of New York-based jetBlue recently made a few interesting comments during a videotaped call to employees, according to Bloomberg, saying of Space-Flex:

“Do I love the fact that we had to go to Space Flex? No, I’ll be honest — of course not. It creates a much bigger challenge for our crew members to provide that service.”

It comes as the airline plans to switch to cart-based service delivery model this month in order to “mitigate some of the pain points with the Flex.”

In the past, jetBlue has taken orders from customers at the seat and then delivered their food and beverages via a tray-based service. But with Space-Flex, crew have apparently preferred doing the service from a cart in the aisle – the airline hopes the change will reduce service times by half and allow it to offer a full range of F&B options on 95% of flights.

Whatever your opinion of Space-Flex, it’s doubtful that it’s going to change now. Whether it helps to bring ticket prices even lower or simply boosts airline profits, cabin crew will need to adapt to the new design. For it’s part, jetBlue says crew will be using specially adapted half-carts – designed by crew to make their job as easy as possible."
"Airbus, Bill Gates and others back video imaging satellite venture - Phys.org","Fri, 20 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE4LTA0LWFpcmJ1cy1iaWxsLWdhdGVzLXZpZGVvLWltYWdpbmcuaHRtbNIBQWh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE4LTA0LWFpcmJ1cy1iaWxsLWdhdGVzLXZpZGVvLWltYWdpbmcuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Credit: CC0 Public Domain

Airbus, Bill Gates and Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son have joined to back a spinoff from Bellevue, Wash.-based Intellectual Ventures that aims to launch a constellation of imaging satellites ""that will deliver real-time, continuous video of almost anywhere on Earth.""

Russell Hannigan, founder and chief executive of the new venture—called EarthNow—said real-time video will provide a leap beyond existing Earth observation satellites that provide still photos and video clips sometime after a user requests the images.

""With EarthNow's constellation of satellites, you will see events unfold as they happen,"" he said. ""We are excited by the prospect of giving everyone a stunningly beautiful, real-time window on your world from space.""

No satellites have yet been built. EarthNow recently closed a first round of financing focused ""primarily on maturing the overall system design.""

Though the amount of funding was not disclosed, it includes investments and partnerships from an impressive list of satellite industry and tech-company heavyweights.

EarthNow's key partner is European aerospace giant Airbus, which proposes to mass-produce the satellites using production lines in Toulouse, France, and in Florida.

Aside from Microsoft co-founder Gates and Son, also investing in EarthNow is Greg Wyler, founder and executive chairman of OneWeb, a large, still-nascent satellite venture that aims to provide broadband internet access globally and has attracted investment of nearly $2 billion.

OneWeb's initial fleet of nearly 900 satellites is also being built by Airbus.

Son heads the Japanese conglomerate Softbank Group, which is also a financial backer of OneWeb.

EarthNow's satellites will be modified versions of the small, low-cost, high-performance models Airbus originally developed for OneWeb, which Hannigan in an interview called ""the Model T of spacecraft.""

The venture is affordable because Airbus and One- Web have figured out how to mass-produce these satellites at low cost, he said.

While the OneWeb satellites will carry a payload of communications software and electronics hardware, EarthNow's payload will be video-imaging software and optical hardware.

Hannigan said the key to EarthNow's technology is that each individual satellite in a constellation of hundreds will have enormous processing power on board.

That means that though each satellite will collect colossal quantities of data—far too much to beam back to Earth in real time—the software will be able to process it all onboard and focus on sending back to Earth only that part of it the user wants to see.

He said the system has been validated in a lab setting, though not yet in space.

The company foresees initial business coming from government and large businesses.

As examples of applications, Hannigan listed monitoring of illegal fishing in the oceans; a warning system that can spot forest fires as soon as they ignite; mapping and guiding traffic flows through a ""smart city""; and real-time media reports of events happening in remote sites.

But eventually, Hannigan said, the goal is to develop a service that consumers can access to observe what's happening now on any part of the globe.

""You should be able to look around, to pan and zoom and explore the world for yourself in real time,"" he said. ""That's the ultimate goal.""

The project was incubated by Intellectual Ventures, founded and led by Microsoft's former chief technology officer, Nathan Myhrvold. His firm specializes in patenting technologies and bringing them to market.

Hannigan said the company is for now still housed at the offices of Intellectual Ventures but is scouting for its own space, likely somewhere on the Eastside.

He said a joint Airbus/EarthNow team of about 25 to 30 people is currently working on the project, with about half in Toulouse and half in Bellevue.

He said he expects to hire more people here after the next funding round.

When its satellites are built, EarthNow will have to line up launch providers to get them into orbit and a ground network to receive and process the incoming video data.

All that lies ahead. ""We're at the beginning phase,"" said Hannigan, declining to say when he expects the service to begin operating.

50th anniversary of the trademark Fenestron - Airbus,"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wNC01MHRoLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LW9mLXRoZS10cmFkZW1hcmstZmVuZXN0cm9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Celebrating one of Airbus Helicopters’ most recognizable innovations

Continues to set new standards with the H160



Marignane, 12 April 2018 – On the 12th of April 1968, the first Fenestron, invented by Paul Fabre and René Mouille, took to the skies on the second prototype of the Gazelle. It has since become emblematic of Sud Aviation, Aerospatiale, Eurocopter and now Airbus helicopters with the H160 carrying this sound-reducing, safety-enhancing technology into the next generation of rotorcraft.

The idea behind shrouding the tail rotor was initially developed to provide additional safeguards for workers on the ground but also to protect the tail rotor in forward flight and in complicated operational environments, such as working around high-voltage power lines. Sound reduction benefits followed after much research and optimisation from one generation of the Fenestron to the next.



Originally called the “Fenestrou”, which is Provençal for “little window”, the term evolved into the renowned Fenestron. It was first certified on the Gazelle in 1972 and then subsequently integrated into the first single-engine Dauphin prototype, whose first flight was in June 1972. Trials were then conducted with a seven-tonne Puma in 1975, however, with its diameter of 1m60 and its 11 tail rotor blades it required too much power for the Fenestron to bring an operational advantage on this class of helicopters.



The second generation came at the end of the 1970’s with an all-composite Fenestron, which increased the diameter of the new Dauphin’s Fenestron by 20% up to 1m10. This improvement was motivated by the U.S. Coast Guards’ requirement for a highly manoeuvrable aircraft for Search and Rescue operations. The U.S. Coast Guards aircraft are still in service today and have accumulated more than 1.5 million flight hours.



In the meantime, research continued to optimise the shape of the Fenestron, blade foils, and to improve sound reduction, especially during certain phases of flight. Between 1987 and 1991 it was successfully tested on an Ecureuil, the prototype of which is still on display at the entrance to Airbus Helicopters’ headquarters in Marignane.



In 1994, the 3rd generation was fitted onto the H135 and optimized sound levels by using an uneven setting of the blades. In 1999 the H130 performed its maiden flight with a Fenestron derived from this version. The H145 followed suit in 2010.



50 years on, the H160 possesses the latest and largest Fenestron to be built on an Airbus helicopter with a diameter of 1m20. The fact that it is canted to 12° allows for improved performance with an additional payload and increased stability especially at low speed. With the H160 out to conquer the medium twin market, the Fenestron will be one of Airbus Helicopters’ signatures in the skies for decades to come.

Airbus presents 'Flight Lab' BLADE test aircraft to EU Clean Sky partners at ILA - Airbus,"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wNC1haXJidXMtcHJlc2VudHMtZmxpZ2h0LWxhYi1ibGFkZS10ZXN0LWFpcmNyYWZ0LXRvLWV1LWNsZWFuLXNredIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"· Showcasing its “Flight Lab” BLADE demonstrator aircraft for the first time at a major air show.

· The most extensive wing laminar flow demonstrator programme ever undertaken for commercial aviation.

· Improving aviation’s ecological footprint, with a 50% reduction in wing friction.

Airbus, which is showcasing its “Flight Lab” BLADE demonstrator aircraft for the first time at a major air show, has signed an accord with representatives of the numerous stakeholders to not only mark the joint success of bringing this unique programme to fruition, but also affirm their desire to build on this programme in the European framework of Clean Sky. The stakeholders present together with Airbus CEO Tom Enders at the ceremony included members of the European Parliament, the European Commission, the German Government, European Member States and industrial partners across Europe.

The BLADE project, which stands for “Breakthrough Laminar Aircraft Demonstrator in Europe”, is part of the first phase of Clean Sky – a 1.6 billion Euro programme which has been running since 2008. BLADE has been tasked with assessing the feasibility of introducing laminar flow wing technology on a large airliner. It aims to improve aviation’s ecological footprint, bringing with it a 10 percent aircraft drag reduction and up to five percent lower CO 2 emissions. Airbus worked with a team of more than 20 key partners* and around 500 contributors from all over Europe. Moreover, due to its size and complexity, this project was only possible thanks to the European Research initiative Clean Sky.

In September 2017 Airbus’ A340 laminar-flow Flight Lab test demonstrator aircraft (A340-300 MSN001) made its successful maiden flight and since then has been engaged in successful testing to explore the wing’s characteristics in flight. The test aircraft is the first in the world to combine a transonic laminar wing profile with a true internal primary structure.

On the outside the aircraft is fitted with two representative transonic laminar outer-wings, while inside the cabin there is a highly complex specialist flight-test-instrumentation (FTI) station. The extensive modifications to the A340-300 test-bed aircraft took place during the course of a 16-month working party in Tarbes, France, with the support of the numerous industrial partners across Europe. In terms of the testing technology, notable ‘firsts’ included the use of infrared cameras to monitor the laminar flow transition points and the acoustic generator which measures the influence of acoustics on laminarity. Another first is the innovative reflectometry system which measures overall deformation in real-time during flight. To date the Flight Lab has performed 66 flight hours. Flights will continue until 2019, dedicated to exploring the influencing factors on laminarity.

Ultra long-range Airbus A350 XWB completes maiden flight - New Atlas,"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2xvbmctcmFuZ2UtYWlyYnVzLWEzNTB4d2ItbWFpZGVuLWZsaWdodC81NDMyOS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In March, a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner set a new record for the world's longest commercial route, but that may not stand for long with the arrival of the latest version of the Airbus Ultra Long Range A350 XWB. The twin-engined aircraft made its maiden flight from Toulouse-Blagnac Airport in France as part of a short test program to certify a number of modifications to increase its range and efficiency.

When Qantas opened its first direct flight from Perth to London on March 25, it was a new milestone in commercial aviation, but it seems as if the 9,000 mile (14,498 km) non-stop route won't hold the crown for long. Scheduled to enter service with Singapore Airlines later this year, the new A350 will exploit its 9,700 nm (11,163 mi, 17,964 km) range on the first direct Singapore to New York passenger flights – a trip of 9,500 mi (15,218 km).

Designated MSN 216, the new A350 XWB sports a number of tweaks to improve its range, including a modified fuel system that increases fuel capacity by 24,000 l (5,279 gal) without needing external fuel tanks, as well as extended winglets, and a carbon fiber fuselage and wings. Put together, this results in a takeoff weight of 280 tonnes and allows for 20 hours of non-stop flying time, a new commercial range record and a 25 percent reduction in fuel use and emissions as well as noise reduction.

Development at an estimated cost of €12 billion, the A350 XWB comes in three variants seating 270 to 350 passengers in three class layouts. It's powered by two Rolls Royce XWB Trent engines that put out 84,000 lb of thrust each and were built especially for the plane, which has a cruising speed of Mach 0.85 (903 km/h, 561 mph, 487 knots).

Airbus says that so far it has 854 firm orders for the A350 XWB from 45 customers around the world.

SAS signs firm order for 35 Airbus A320neo Family aircraft - Airbus,"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wNC1zYXMtc2lnbnMtZmlybS1vcmRlci1mb3ItMzUtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjBuZW8tZmFtaWx5LWFpcmNyYWZ00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Repeat order for the most fuel-efficient aircraft

SAS Group has signed a firm order for 35 A320neo aircraft. SAS will also lease 15 additional A320neos from leasing companies. This important new strategic commitment will result in SAS becoming an all Airbus operator with the fuel-efficient A320 family for its mainline European operations, as well as for its extensive domestic services in Scandinavia.

These new A320neos will join the airline’s existing Airbus fleet of 56 aircraft (eight A340s, eight A330s and 40 A320 Family aircraft). The engine selection will be announced by the airline at a later date. SAS has been an Airbus customer since 1980.

“Just over one year ago, we started to phase into service brand new Airbus A320neos, and since then we have received a very positive response from our customers. I’m therefore delighted that, through this order, we can continue improving and investing in our customer offering, and thereby SAS’s future. We are also creating a single-type and more efficient fleet for the first time. Ordering 50 Airbus A320neos gives us access to the market’s most efficient aircraft thereby enabling us to further improve our operational efficiency and to continue to reduce our climate-impacting emissions,” says Rickard Gustafson, President and CEO of SAS.

“We are proud with this repeat commitment by SAS. The A320neo will complement SAS’s existing Airbus fleet, with unbeatable fuel efficiency, the lowest operating costs and environmental footprint. It is the perfect choice for SAS, for replacing its older generation aircraft. This means more of SAS’s passengers will keep enjoying the best comfort in the skies,” said Eric Schulz, Chief Commercial Officer, Airbus Commercial Aircraft.

The A320neo Family incorporates the very latest technologies including new generation engines and Sharklets, which together deliver at least 15 percent fuel savings at delivery and 20 percent by 2020. With more than 6,000 orders received from 99 customers, the A320neo Family has captured nearly 60 percent share of the market."
A350-900 lands in Chile for FIDAE air show - Airbus,"Tue, 03 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wNC1hMzUwLTkwMC1sYW5kcy1pbi1jaGlsZS1mb3ItZmlkYWUtYWlyLXNob3fSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"World’s most modern airliner on static and flying display during Latin America’s iconic air show

The A350-900 flight test aircraft arrived at Santiago Chile’s Arturo Merino Benitez Airport for the 20th edition of the FIDAE air show, where it will be on static display and take part in flying demonstrations between 2-5 April.

The A350-900 displayed in Santiago, MSN002, first made its debut at FIDAE in 2016. MSN002 is one of the five original development test aircraft, fitted with a two-class cabin with 42 lie-flat, business-class seats in a four-abreast configuration and 210 economy-class seats in a nine-abreast configuration. This aircraft was used for testing all cabin-related systems, which have demonstrated a high level of maturity since the A350-900’s entry into service in 2015.

The A350-900 is a member of the A350 XWB Family, an all-new family of mid-size widebody long-haul airliners shaping the future of air travel. Since its launch, Airbus has captured nearly 50 percent market share of net orders of widebody aircraft in Latin America.

In 2016, LATAM Airlines Group became the first operator in the Americas to fly the A350 XWB when it started operating its first of 27 on order. Other A350 XWB customers in the region include Synergy Aerospace, Avianca’s main shareholder and owner of Avianca Brasil, which has ordered 10 A350 XWB.

The A350 XWB features the latest aerodynamic design, carbon fibre fuselage and wings, plus new fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce engines. Together, these latest technologies translate into unrivalled levels of operational efficiency, with a 25 percent reduction in fuel burn and emissions, and significantly lower maintenance costs. More than 26 million passengers have already enjoyed the absolute comfort of the A350 XWB Airspace cabin which, on top of the aircraft’s spaciousness and quietness, provides better ambience, design and services.

Currently operated by 17 airlines, the A350 XWB has flown more than 100,000 flight cycles over more than 200 routes."
Emirates: Airbus A380 makes first-ever revenue flight to Beirut - USA TODAY,"Tue, 03 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdHJhdmVsL2ZsaWdodHMvdG9kYXlpbnRoZXNreS8yMDE4LzA0LzAzL2VtaXJhdGVzLXNlbmRzLTM4MC1zdXBlcmp1bWJvLWxlYmFub24tYnJpbmdzLWhvcGUtdG91cmlzbS1yZXZpdmFsLzQ4Mjc1MDAwMi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Emirates sends A380 superjumbo to Beirut, spurring hope of tourism revival

BEIRUT (AP) — The world's largest passenger jet landed at Beirut's international airport last week, bringing with it hope for a revival of Lebanon's vital tourism sector.

The one-off Emirates Airbus A380 flight from Dubai on Thursday (March 29) was an acknowledgement of the substantial passenger traffic between Lebanon and Gulf nations, where many Lebanese nationals work and more pass through to destinations farther afield.

Emirates said it scheduled the flight, the first of its kind to carry paying passengers, to see if Beirut's Rafik Hariri International Airport was ready to handle regular A380 service.

Lebanese officials hope the results are positive, as tourist arrivals climb to levels last seen in 2010, before the uprising in neighboring Syria the following year raised fears of violent spillover.

Lebanon welcomed 1.85 million tourists in 2017, according to the Tourism Ministry. That's the most since 2.16 million came in 2010.

There are nine flights daily from Dubai to Beirut, on three different carriers.

Tourism is one of the key pillars of Lebanon's economy, accounting for 19% of the country's GDP, according to the U.K.-based World Travel and Tourism Council.

However, Beirut's Rafik Hariri International Airport, Lebanon's only commercial airfield, is sorely out-of-date and lines at security can stretch for hours in the summer months, when throngs of expatriates visit the country.

The airport, renovated after the 1975-1990 civil war, was designed to handle 6 million passengers annually. In 2017, it saw over 8 million, according to the airport's research department. Its gate areas are grimy and gloomy — a poor reflection of politicians' outsized ambitions for the national tourism industry.

Lebanon's Cabinet and the country's flagship airline, Middle East Airlines, are considering two plans to expand and improve the airport's facilities, one costing $88 million and the other $200 million. Their aim is to expand capacity to 10 million passengers annually by 2020 and then support continued growth beyond that.

The First-Ever Airbus A340 is Reborn as a FlightLab - The Points Guy,"Thu, 26 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1maXJzdC1ldmVyLWEzNDAtcmVib3JuLWZsaWdodGxhYi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A 2.5-decade-old aircraft has recently been reborn in a quest to revolutionize the future of aircraft wings. Airbus' first-ever A340 aircraft (MSN001, registration F-WWAI) looks a lot different today than when it took its first flight on October 25, 1991 — almost exactly 26.5 years ago.

This rebirth has been a decade in the works. In 2008, 21 partners across eight European countries launched a partnership called the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking to develop new innovations for quieter and more efficient aircraft. One of its initial projects was the ""BLADE"" (Breakthrough Laminar Aircraft Demonstrator in Europe) project.

BLADE's quest: a laminar flow wing design. Simply put, BLADE is trying to create a wing with a perfectly smooth airflow. Based on models, Airbus believes that a laminar flow wing design can reduce wing drag by 50% and increase fuel efficiency by 5%.

After substantial modeling, it was time to put the research to the test. So, Clean Sky's lead partner Airbus donated its first ever Airbus A340 to the cause. The aircraft manufacturer chopped off the ends of each wing — just past the second engines. In its place, it fitted two prototype wing designs — one on the end of each of the wings. On the left, the ""more innovative"" Saab design. On the right, a ""more traditional"" GKN Aerospace design. And with that, the BLADE FlightLab was born.

As this technology is still in the experimental phase, only five crew are on board during the test flights — two pilots and three test flight engineers.

Two of the engineers sit at this station to monitor up to 1,650 different parameters during flight.

To make room for the test equipment needed to record and analyze all of those parameters, all of the seats, wall paneling and most of the overhead bins were stripped out of the interior.

Although it's been flying since September 2017, the partnership waited until the ILA Berlin airshow to show it off to the aviation public. In a signing ceremony on Wednesday, all of the Clean Sky partners marked the occasion by signing the aircraft, one at a time.

Between its first flight in September 2017 and the conclusion of the testing in 2019, researchers plan to operate 168 hours of flight time with the new wing segments. As of today, the test aircraft has recorded 66 flight hours. From what's being shared so far, the results have been great. Even on the first flight, the engineers were able to determine there was laminar flow over both wing designs.

That said, there's still a long way to go, even with the initial testing — and there are challenges to overcome. One of those is insects. While the wing segments are designed to have perfect laminar flow, something as small as insects smashing against the leading edge of the wing can create airflow turbulence and decrease performance.

Once the initial testing is complete, the Clean Sky initiative hopes to have enough research done on the technology to create a full experimental wing with laminar flow for additional testing. So, while laminar flow wings are still a way off from commercial aviation, it's exciting to see what innovations are in the works for even more fuel-efficient aircraft."
Ural Airlines' all-Airbus fleet grows to 45 aircraft - Russian aviation news - www.rusaviainsider.com,"Mon, 23 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ1c2F2aWFpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS91cmFsLWFpcmxpbmVzLWFpcmJ1cy1mbGVldC1ncm93bi00NS1haXJjcmFmdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Gearing up for a busy summer season, Yekaterinburg-based Ural Airlines has continued to increase its all-Airbus fleet, with three more expected to join by July.

The first of the latest batch, a seven-year-old Airbus A321-200 taken on operational lease from Avolon, arrived on April 19 and became the 45th A320-family aircraft in its fleet. Two more narrow-bodies are expected to be delivered in the next two months.

The latest aircraft (tail number VP-BIH, MSN 4728) was previously operated by Germany’s Air Berlin and its Austrian sister airline Niki. The CFM56-5B-powered aircraft has a single-class layout seating 220 passengers in economy class and is planned to be used both on international and domestic flights.

By July, the peak month of the year, Ural plans to operate 47 aircraft to ensure smooth operations across its expanding route network.

A shortage of secondary market aircraft which meet the airline’s required technical specifications means that Ural Airlines will not be able to expand its fleet to 50 aircraft this year, as announced just a few months ago. According to the revised plans, Ural expects to transport 9.2 million passengers in 2018, up 15 per cent year-on-year, slightly less than 10 million originally envisioned.

To achieve this target, the carrier is banking on the development of its route network inside Russia, whilst also strengthening its Moscow presence by adding more flights out of Sheremetyevo (SVO) airport as well as basing three aircraft at Zhukovsky (ZIA) airport.

The Yekaterinburg-based carrier, which is ranked as the country’s fourth largest in terms of passenger numbers, is the only Russian airline whose fleet consists entirely of Airbus narrow-bodies: 24 A320s, 14 A321s and seven A319s.

The airline is both a loyal and effective Airbus operator, as identified by the European planemaker when it declared Ural as the leading A320 aircraft family operator in Russia for two consecutive years, with an average daily utilization rate of 12.71 hours per unit in 2017."

I want to stand outside of the box and create interiors that move concepts forward.” Glamour is her beat—layered, sumptuous spaces that treat decoration like a high virtue and are defined by her good instincts for welcoming indulgence or politely switching it to low-power mode.

An innate instinct for reading clients guided her work for the owner of this Airbus A340, who wanted “a stylish ‘residence in the sky’ for himself and his family, with spacious, private areas and all the options to entertain business guests while traveling around the world,” according to Sawyer. Having previously collaborated with the client, a royal from the Middle East, she found a natural groove. Still, this was her largest private aircraft to date. “The last thing I wanted was a garish interior or something too bland. His brief was that it had to have the ‘wow factor.’”

She answered with unflinching originality, employing a fearless volt of blue, golden verve, and a corps of specialty artisans ready to ride shotgun on this supersonic decorative escapade. In the salon and lounge areas, a series of individual, gold-plated sections trace the curvature of the aircraft, giving confident depth to the interior. Sawyer balanced these elements with linear furniture dressed in hand-stitched Tuscan leather, superlative silks, and a touch of velvet. The bar is illuminated from beneath, while two crystal chandeliers with 24-karat-gold accents emit an aureate glow. The center tables are veneered, which was a pragmatic solution, as weight—like safety, shock-proofing, and fire prevention—is a constant consideration aboard an aircraft.

The salon and lounge’s cooler alter ego emerges in the master suite, where the designer’s signature palette envelopes the space. The hand-stitched leather headboard is flanked by bespoke bedside crystal fixtures, which were specially constructed to prevent any swing during flight. The main bathroom has a Swarovski-crystal-and-glass washbasin, while the master bath features midnight-blue marble and an integrated mirror-faced television, fulfilling the client’s wish for electronic amenities.

The project is a glossy, glamorous trip into the experiential. The interior gives the impression of a hotel or restaurant that has outlived Soho House’s relaxed leather earnestness and opted for a little sizzle. Perhaps the highest compliment to be paid this space is that it does not resemble a private plane at all—a point that establishes Sawyer, whose design career has spanned more than two decades, as an accomplished luxury rebel. “I am working with the Royal Navy now, designing the Officers’ Mess on their warship HMS Queen Elizabeth. [The dining hall] has the old-fashioned ‘always-been-done’ look, and I am keen to change history on this.”"

Toulouse, 12 April 2018 – The SES-12 all-electric communications satellite, built by Airbus for SES, has been shipped from the Airbus Defence and Space facilities in Toulouse, France, to Cape Canaveral, Florida.

SES-12 is the largest and most powerful all electric satellite ever produced. It is based on the highly reliable Eurostar platform in its E3000e variant, which uses electric propulsion for orbit raising (EOR). The related mass saving enables SES-12 to combine two high-capacity missions, equivalent to two conventional satellites, in one satellite.



To fulfill its dual mission, SES-12 features both wide beams and high throughput spot beams to serve diverse connectivity needs.



The communications payload incorporates state-of-the-art solutions, in particular multi-beam antennas linked to a digital signal processor, which enable a multitude of basic spectral channels to be allocated to various beams in a completely flexible manner.



The satellite will provide expansion and replacement capacity to serve the data, mobility, government and video sectors in the Asia-Pacific region.



SES-12 will operate in the Ku and Ka-bands with a total of 76 active transponders and eight antennas. It will have a launch mass of 5,400 kg and an electrical power of 19 kW. It will operate in geostationary orbit at the 95° East location and has been designed to remain in service for more than 15 years.

The sleeper compartments “would fit inside the aircraft’s cargo compartment”, said Airbus and Zodiac Aerospace, which is a subsidiary of the French aerospace company Safran.

The modules “will be easily interchangeable with regular cargo containers”.

“Airlines will initially be able to choose from a catalogue of certified solutions by 2020 on A330” for the sleeper pods. The possibility of fitting them into A350 XWB airliners is also being looked at.

Airbus and Zodiac said the sleeping berths would not only improve passenger comfort but would let airlines add value for their commercial operations.

“This approach to commercial air travel is a step change towards passenger comfort,” said Geoff Pinner, the head of Airbus’s cabin and cargo program.

“We have already received very positive feedback from several airlines on our first mock-ups.”

Christophe Bernardini, head of Zodiac’s aerospace cabin division, said the project “reaffirms our expertise in lower-deck solutions. An improved passenger experience is today a key element of differentiation for airlines.”

In November 2016 Air France-KLM had put forward the idea of sleeping berths for passengers in economy class, either in the hold or above the cabin in aircraft of the group’s new low-cost subsidiary, Joon."

Airbus is making the world smaller, and our nonstop flights longer. The very first A350-900 ULR (Ultra Long-Range) aircraft took off from Airbus' manufacturing headquarters in Toulouse, France on Monday, completing its first test flight as Airbus prepares the airplane for delivery to Singapore Airlines later this year. It will be used to relaunch the Singapore to New York flight, which will become the longest nonstop in the world.

The aircraft, registered F-WZNY, flew for 4 hours and 40 minutes over France and the Mediterranean before returning to Toulouse.

The A350-900 ULR, the super long-range version of the existing twinjet widebody, will be able to carry more fuel and fly quite a bit farther than the existing A350-900. So far, in fact that it will make feasible some ultra long-haul flights that were once either out of reach or uneconomical. Singapore Airlines — so far the only customer of this specialized aircraft — hopes to take full advantage of this increased range with nonstop flights to New York City (probably Newark, EWR) and Los Angeles (LAX), two routes it once flew with the four-engined A340-500 but terminated in late 2014 due to high operating costs. Airbus hopes other long-haul airlines like Australian flag carrier Qantas will also take interest in the plane, particularly as Qantas begins connecting distant cities with nonstop flights, like their new Perth to London nonstop service. Airbus claims the ULR will have a range of 9,700 nautical miles — over 10,000 statute miles — some 1,600 nautical miles more than the A350-900 and nearly 2,000 nautical miles more than the A350-1000. This is more than enough for a 19-hour New York - Singapore nonstop, but not quite enough for, say, Sydney to New York.

Singapore expects to take delivery of its first A350-900 ULR in August of this year, and, while the airline hasn't specified, we expect the aircraft to come with a special low-density configuration, similar to the A340-500s that once flew to New York and LA — then the longest nonstops in the world. While those old A340s had only 100 business class seats in the whole cabin, we expect these planes to come with a two-cabin configuration, likely with Singapore's A350 business class seats. We can't be sure until they're bookable, but if you're interested in booking what will be the world's longest flight on points, we'd bet it won't be cheap, even with Singapore's great award availability."
