Airbus partners with DG Fuels to foster sustainable aviation fuel production in the United States - Airbus,"Tue, 12 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0wOS1haXJidXMtcGFydG5lcnMtd2l0aC1kZy1mdWVscy10by1mb3N0ZXItc3VzdGFpbmFibGUtYXZpYXRpb24tZnVlbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, France / Washington, D.C.- 12 September 2023 - Airbus has become a strategic partner with DG Fuels, LLC (“DGF”), an emerging leader in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

""Sustainable aviation fuels play a crucial role in enabling aviation's decarbonisation roadmap. We are committed to supporting all efforts that contribute to making them available at scale around the globe,"" said Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury. ""The partnership with DG Fuels supports the emergence of a new technological pathway allowing for the production of SAFs from a broader range of waste and residue sources, first in the U.S with a potential for large-scale production worldwide.""

DGF’s fuel production system is based entirely on cellulosic waste products, such as wood waste from the logging industry, and renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power.

DGF’s plant aims to have an initial production capacity of 120 million US gallons (454 million litres) of SAF per year on average, which could save approximately 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 emissions annually from 2026.

""The DGF team is excited to have finalised this SAF partnership with Airbus,"" commented Michael Darcy, Chairman and CEO at DG Fuels, ""and we look forward to working together to accelerate the initial SAF facility in Louisiana and the subsequent scale up at various locations in the United States and beyond.”

The partnership with Airbus supports DG Fuels’ goal of launching the equity process and reaching a final investment decision (FID) on building DG Fuels’ first SAF plant in the United States. The decision would be expected by early 2024. In this context, Airbus and DGF have agreed for a portion of the production of the first plant to benefit Airbus’ customers.

This project is in line with the U.S. government-sponsored SAF Grand Challenge, which aims to reduce costs, improve sustainability and expand domestic SAF production. This national programme aims to produce 3 billion US gallons (11.3 billion litres) of domestic sustainable aviation fuel per year, achieving at least a 50% reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to conventional fuel by 2030 and 100% of projected aviation fuel consumption – or 35 billion US gallons of annual production - by 2050.

About DG Fuels

DG Fuels is building a low-CO2 life cycle emissions synthetic fuel system based on high carbon conversion technology that is targeting a 97% efficiency. The DG Fuels’ technology does not require the development of new engines or types of distribution infrastructure. DG Fuels’ innovative technology produces hydrogen via water electrolysis and biomass derived carbon replacement fuel for aircraft, and potentially for locomotives, vessels and trucks as well. DG Fuels delivers a significant value proposition to end-customers, including meaningful environmental benefits and the ability to materially address sustainability goals.

About Airbus action plan on sustainable aviation fuels

SAF has been identified as one of the key elements in helping achieve emissions reduction goals. Since 2008, Airbus has acted as an important catalyst in the certification process, demonstration flights, partnerships and policy advocacy of sustainable aviation fuel. In 2016, Airbus became the first aircraft manufacturer to offer customers SAF at delivery flights. Today, aircraft and helicopters leave Airbus delivery centres with SAF onboard from Toulouse and Marignane in France, Hamburg and Donauworth in Germany, Mobile in the USA, and most recently Tianjin, China. Airbus operations and logistics are also carried out with SAF including our fleet of Belugas from 2019. Airbus’ commercial aircraft, helicopters and military aircraft are capable of flying with an up to 50% blend of SAF mixed with kerosene and will be capable of operating with 100% SAF by 2030. This capability will play an important role in the sector’s decarbonisation journey.

KEMBLE, United Kingdom and HOLLISTER, Calif., Sept. 18, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- ZeroAvia today announced that Airbus , Barclays Sustainable Impact Capital and NEOM have co-led the company's latest financing round.

Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Horizons Ventures, Alaska Airlines, Ecosystem Integrity Fund, Summa Equity, AP Ventures and Amazon Climate Pledge Fund have also participated in the investment.

ZeroAvia is developing hydrogen-electric aircraft engines to deliver truly clean commercial aviation.

This investment will enable ZeroAvia to accelerate progress towards certification of its first engine as well as delivering the company's mission of a hydrogen-electric engine in every aircraft.

In conjunction with the investment, Airbus and ZeroAvia have agreed to collaborate on certification approaches for hydrogen power systems. The companies also intend to work together on a number of critical technical areas, including liquid hydrogen fuel storage, flight and ground testing of fuel cell propulsion systems, and development of hydrogen refueling infrastructure and operations.

ZeroAvia is pursuing hydrogen-electric propulsion systems as the most environmentally friendly and economically attractive solution to aviation's growing climate change impact. The company's hydrogen-electric engines use hydrogen in fuel cells to generate electricity, which is then used to power electric motors to turn the aircraft's propellers, with the only byproduct during flight being water.

Airbus is a global leader in fostering alternative propulsion using hydrogen. Fuel cell systems are an important part of its ZEROe aircraft concepts program, designed to deliver low-carbon emission airframes of various sizes. The industry major has recently ground tested a hydrogen engine concept at 1.2 MW power.

The investment will support ZeroAvia's continued growth and technology development, most notably progressing its first product – ZA600 - through to certification. ZeroAvia recently completed the first stage of flight testing of the prototype ZA600 and is moving to complete design work ahead of certification, targeting 2025 entry-in-service to support up to 20 seat aircraft.

The funding will also enable ZeroAvia to continue to progress its larger engine program - the ZA2000, a 2-5.4 MW modular powertrain designed to support larger commercial aircraft applications. The company is working on retrofitting a Dash 8 400 76-seat testbed demonstrator provided by Alaska Airlines, with a view to first flight testing with a full size engine in 2024. The investment will help ZeroAvia extend the leadership it has established across core in-house technologies for multi-MW class hydrogen-electric engines, including high temperature PEM (HTPEM) fuel cells, advanced electric motors and power electronics, and onboard liquid hydrogen fuel storage.

Val Miftakhov, Founder and CEO, ZeroAvia, said: ""Anybody following the development of hydrogen aviation - and its potential to transform the industry - will see this investment as a positive step. Airbus has led the way with its zero-emission vision and its commitment to extensive R&D programs. For ZeroAvia to now have investors such as Airbus coming on board is the strongest possible validation of the prospects for hydrogen-electric propulsion technology.""

""ZeroAvia has already been successful in flight testing fuel cell propulsion, and hydrogen storage and distribution systems on board their Do-228 flight test platform which puts them in a strong position to take their technologies to the next phase of development,"" said Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus Vice President ZEROe aircraft. ""In addition, ZeroAvia is supporting the development of a wider hydrogen ecosystem for aviation - technologies, decarbonised hydrogen supply and certification of hydrogen propulsion systems - which all complement well with our own ambition to bring a ZEROe hydrogen powered aircraft to service by 2035.""

Andy Challis, Co-Head of Principal Investments, Barclays, said: ""Replacing fossil fuels with green hydrogen has been identified as a key decarbonisation pathway for hard to abate sectors, such as aviation. Our Sustainable Impact Capital portfolio is one of many ways which Barclays is supporting green-tech companies to innovate and scale, recognising that doing so at speed is crucial for a timely transition to net zero. ZeroAvia has shown that with ambition, technological innovation and the right support from both the public and private sector, it is possible to scale and implement such hydrogen technologies at pace, as evidenced by the ZA600 moving ever closer to commercial flight. We're delighted to be making a follow-on investment and look forward to seeing ZeroAvia continuing to drive change in the aviation sector.""

Majid Mufti, Managing Director NEOM Investment Fund, said: ""At NEOM, we are committed to identifying and implementing sustainable solutions that pave the way for a greener future. Our focus on maximizing renewable energy sources and fostering innovation in alternative fuel systems aligns with ZeroAvia's pioneering efforts in hydrogen-electric propulsion technology. Developing a green hydrogen future is central to NEOM's mission, and participating in this venture with ZeroAvia was a natural choice for us. We look forward to working closely with the company and contributing significantly to reaching that future.""

Airbus investigates data leak allegedly involving thousands of suppliers - The Record from Recorded Future News,"Tue, 12 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVjb3JkLm1lZGlhL2FpcmJ1cy1kYXRhLWxlYWstc3VwcGxpZXJzLWJyZWFjaGVkZm9ydW1z0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The European aerospace giant Airbus said on Tuesday that it is investigating a cybersecurity incident following reports that a hacker posted information on 3,200 of the company’s vendors to the dark web.

A threat actor using the moniker ""USDoD"" posted Monday on BreachForums that they obtained access to an Airbus web portal after compromising the account of a Turkish airline employee. The hacker claimed to have details on thousands of Airbus vendors, including names, addresses, phone numbers and emails, according to a report from Hudson Rock.

Airbus spokesperson Philippe Gmerek confirmed to Recorded Future News that hackers breached an “IT account associated with an Airbus customer” and that the company was investigating the incident. This account was used to download business documents dedicated to this customer from an Airbus web portal, the company said.

“Immediate remedial and follow-up measures were taken by our security teams to prevent our systems from being compromised,” Gmerek told Recorded Future News in an email.

According to the Hudson Rock, the threat actor — who appears to be linked to a December 2022 breach of the FBI’s InfraGard system — posted the leaked information publicly without making any demands. Few details are known about the threat actor or their motivations, but they have said they are a member of the relatively new ransomware group known as “Ransomed.”

Aerospace companies are regularly targeted by hackers for the sensitive data and technology they hold. Last week, the FBI, U.S. Cyber Command and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency warned that multiple nation-state hackers exploited two vulnerabilities to target an unnamed aerospace company this year.

In 2019, Airbus experienced a series of cyberattacks directed at its suppliers from hackers who were after commercial secrets. China was the main suspect at that time, although the country repeatedly denied involvement in hacking."
Thaicom picks Airbus to build Eutelsat-backed GEO satellite for Asia - SpaceNews,"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS90aGFpY29tLXBpY2tzLWFpcmJ1cy10by1idWlsZC1ldXRlbHNhdC1iYWNrZWQtZ2VvLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1mb3ItYXNpYS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TAMPA, Fla. — Thaicom has picked Airbus to deliver an Asia-focused spacecraft in 2027, putting the manufacturer ahead of the pack for geostationary communications satellite wins so far this year after leaving 2022 empty-handed.

Airbus said Sept. 11 that Thaicom-10 would be the Thai operator’s first satellite with a software-defined payload, enabling the company to adjust capacity and coverage while in orbit to adapt to changes in demand.

Eutelsat has agreed to lease half the Ku-band satellite’s capacity at 119.5 degrees East, which the French operator said would give it around 50 gigabits per second in extra capacity over Asia.

The companies did not disclose contract terms for Thaicom-10 or their partnership.

Speaking on a panel Sept. 11 during Euroconsult’s World Satellite Business Week conference in Paris, Thaicom CEO Patompob Suwansiri said Eutelsat’s capacity would be focused on maritime and aviation, while the Thai operator would focus on inland markets.

He said the collaboration deal with Eutelsat was more than a year in the making and would provide the foundation for partnerships elsewhere.

Commercial GEO satcoms tally

The high throughput satellite marks the ninth order for Airbus’ recently introduced reconfigurable OneSat product line.

Airbus also won an order for OneSat earlier this year from an undisclosed customer, Airbus Defence and Space spokesperson Ralph Heinrich said.

Separately, Emirati fleet operator Yahsat signed a contract June 16 with Airbus to begin early work on two geostationary communications satellites: Al Yah 4 and Al Yah 5, slated for launch in 2027 and 2028, respectively.

The Authorization-To-Proceed (ATP) agreement covers system requirements review, design work, procurement activities for long-lead items, and other initial activities.

The full procurement contract for these satellites is pending the finalization of a long-term deal to sell their services to the Emirati government.

Al Yah 4 and Al Yah 5 would be based on the manufacturer’s benchmark Eurostar Neo platform, Heinrich said, which uses a traditional “bent pipe” architecture that can be more efficient in areas where demand is more certain.

In April, U.S.-based Dish Network ordered a geostationary satellite from Maxar Technologies to expand high-definition broadcast services over North America.

Californian satellite manufacturing startup Astranis and Swissto12, a 3D printing venture based in Switzerland, have also announced contracts this year as part of a new breed of smaller, more regionally focused geostationary spacecraft.

Astranis said March 14 that Mexican telco Apco Networks had ordered two satellites launching in 2024 and that UtilitySat, slated to launch with SpaceX before the end of this year, will partly serve as an initial replacement for Alaskan telco Pacific Dataport following the failure of its debut spacecraft.

Viasat-owned Inmarsat ordered three small satellites from Swissto12 in May for a launch in 2026.

Thales Alenia Space, Airbus’ European rival that won seven of last year’s orders, has not announced an order so far in 2023 for a commercial satellite communications spacecraft destined for geostationary orbit (GEO).

Didier Radola, head of satcom programs at Airbus Defence and Space, told SpaceNews in February that the company hoped to capture as many as six of the roughly 15 GEOs he expected to be tendered in 2023."

Behind the scenes of 20 years of Airbus Helicopters in Mississippi - Airbus,"Thu, 21 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTA5LWJlaGluZC10aGUtc2NlbmVzLW9mLTIwLXllYXJzLW9mLWFpcmJ1cy1oZWxpY29wdGVycy1pbi1taXNzaXNzaXBwadIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On 25 August, Airbus Helicopters, Inc. celebrated the 20 th anniversary of its industrial site in Columbus, Mississippi (MS) with a retrospective—and a look ahead.

Under skies as colourful as the Mississippi flag, an audience of employees and elected officials applauded the addition to Airbus’ Columbus facility: a display H125 aircraft right by the entrance, with a very Mississippi livery. The magnolia flower was just one reason to cheer.

“We are an entrepreneurial business at heart,” says Johannes Dienemann, Vice PresidentIndustry and Civil Programs at the facility. “Many of our employees have stories of working their way up into leadership roles.”

A truth that dates from the start. Veronica Harris, Supervisor of Planning and Control, was first hired as a security guard, just a year after ground was broken. “My children have grown up while I’ve been at Airbus, so we’ve become a family here,” she says.

Yet why build a manufacturing site far from headquarters (Grand Prairie, TX) in an area that was not exactly known for high-tech business? The answer lay in the location: the tri-city “Golden Triangle” of economic cooperation provided a ready technical workforce, consisting of about 35% military veterans who could put their skills to use. It also lay in the political support that the area provided. The state was eager to work with Industry in creating jobs and in planting seeds for economic growth. The Golden Triangle has since attracted several other key industrial players.

From the start, tireless production

Over the years, work came in strong. A few examples: Airbus started with the re-engining of several US Coast Guard H-65 Dauphin aircraft. This was followed by close to 500 Lakotas – 463 UH-72A and 18 UH-72B models for the US Army, five for the US Naval Test Pilot School, and a handful of aircraft for the Royal Thai Army. Roughly two dozen H125 aircraft were built for Customs and Border Protection. And the first wave of US Army National Guard aircraft is starting to come back to Mississippi for an upgrade to its Security & Support Battalion mission equipment package, the first of which was delivered back in 2010. “This is significant for us but also for the US Army because those aircraft are flying and protecting our nation,” says Dienemann.

It would be easy to cite the close to 500 UH-72A and UH-72B aircraft delivered to the Army as success, but the Columbus facility has notched other achievements, too. In 2014, the plant began building the H125/AStar, producing 30 to 40 a year of this popular model. What’s more, over 1,000 newly manufactured or retrofitted helicopters for commercial, medical and law enforcement missions are proof of the facility’s flexibility and its role in creating a safer and tighter-knit society. Look up in any US city and you’re likely to see a Columbus-built aircraft.

Homegrown and hard-working

Starting with the first 7 employees to 300 today, the site’s impact in creating jobs and opportunities is evident. Veronica Harris is a case $in point; first a security guard then an administrative assistant, she grew interested in Planning and Operations. “I loved everything about shopfloor control. They were the go-getters. I wanted to become a planner.” She now leads her own “busy, busy” team, juggling evolutions such as preparing new programmes like the H160.

Meanwhile, customisation on the first two H160s, recently certified by the FAA, has begun. Twenty years, and the spirit in Columbus is as much go-get-‘em as ever.

Airbus Helicopters, Inc. Columbus, Mississippi by the numbers 1,700+ deliveries 480+ Lakota UH-72 aircraft 500+ H125 aircraft 60+ Department of Homeland Security aircraft 500+ Retrofit modifications 200+ Completions 12 Re-engined MH-65 aircraft

Mississippi H125 static display

The H125 helicopter that now graces the entrance to the Columbus facility joins other display aircraft at Airbus Helicopters sites in France, Germany, Spain and Canada. Its paint scheme reflects its American heritage, as well as that of its home state. The new state flag of Mississippi, a magnolia flower and stars, was ratified in 2021; it is known as the Magnolia flag, featuring red, gold, blue and white. Like the 500 other H125 aircraft that have left the Mississippi facility, the display H125 is a symbol of “what a helicopter is made for: saving lives and protecting the nation,” says Johannes Dienemann.

Airbus to install new fuel-saving sails for maritime operations - Airbus,"Thu, 28 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0wOS1haXJidXMtdG8taW5zdGFsbC1uZXctZnVlbC1zYXZpbmctc2FpbHMtZm9yLW1hcml0aW1lLW9wZXJhdGlvbnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse - Airbus will equip one of the vessels it uses to transport aircraft subassemblies, chartered from shipowner Louis Dreyfus Armateurs, with a wind-assisted propulsion technology that captures wind energy to generate thrust and, therefore, delivers savings in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.

The eSAIL, developed by the Spain-based firm bound4blue, creates as much as six to seven times more lift than a conventional rigid sail. It consists of a sail-like vertical surface and an electric-powered air suction system that helps the airflow to re-adhere to the sail, generating additional lift and thereby reducing the load on the ship’s main engines.

Three 22-metre-high eSAILs will be fitted to the Ville de Bordeaux ahead of a six-month performance monitoring period starting early 2024. The Ville de Bordeaux regularly ferries A320 Family subassemblies from Europe to Mobile in the United States for final assembly.

Fitting the eSAILs on the Ville de Bordeaux supports Airbus’ commitment to halve CO2 emissions from its maritime operations by 2030, compared to a 2015 baseline. According to bound4blue estimations, these eSAILs could deliver fuel and CO2 emissions savings of up to 560 tons and 1,800 tons respectively for this ship annually.

The installation of eSAILs on the Ville de Bordeaux is co-funded by the European Union.

“We at Airbus have been studying wind-assisted technologies as a potential energy source for our maritime operations for many years,” said Nicolas Chrétien, Head of Sustainability & Environment at Airbus. “As we embark on an exciting journey with our partners Louis Dreyfus Armateurs and bound4blue, we reaffirm our ambition to explore all innovation pathways to develop more sustainable maritime solutions and further reduce the carbon footprint of our industrial operations. This technology looks promising and we are eager to start testing it in real conditions by the end of the year.”

“At Louis Dreyfus Armateurs, we are committed to supporting the decarbonization of the shipping industry, achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050,” said Mathieu Muzeau, Transport & Logistic General Manager at Louis Dreyfus Armateurs. “Wind-assisted propulsion is one of the solutions we believe will help us reach this objective. To determine the best technology for our operations, we are eager to identify and test various forms of wind-assisted propulsion, including rotating vertical cylinders, flexible sails, rigid sails, and wings. We are pleased to announce that we will soon install bound4blue’s eSAILs on our ro-ro vessel, Ville de Bordeaux, which we operate for Airbus.”

David Ferrer, CTO of bound4blue, said: “After having implemented and proven our technology on three ships already, we’re excited to install our 22-metre eSAILs on Ville de Bordeaux. This deployment will mark the first-ever fixed suction sail installation on a Ro-Ro ship, demonstrating that suction sails can be deployed on ships with high weather deck and large windage area, not compromising the vessel’s stability.”

UK hydrogen alliance established to accelerate zero carbon aviation and bring an £34bn* annual benefit to the country - Airbus,"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0wOS11ay1oeWRyb2dlbi1hbGxpYW5jZS1lc3RhYmxpc2hlZC10by1hY2NlbGVyYXRlLXplcm8tY2FyYm9uLWF2aWF0aW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Hydrogen in Aviation (HIA) alliance of major players across aviation will work to accelerate the delivery of zero carbon aviation

The UK is currently in a strong position to become a global leader in hydrogen-powered aviation, but further steps must be taken to capture the opportunity, secure long-term employment and economic benefits, as well as meet critical decarbonisation targets.

HIA aims to assist Government and policymakers by mapping out the milestones to ensure infrastructure, regulatory and policy changes keep pace with the ground-breaking technological developments in carbon-free flying

It is critical that the supply of hydrogen, and the infrastructure needed to support zero carbon flying, are prioritised if the significant social and economic benefits of flying are to be preserved

New research shows that 81% of the British public believe hydrogen is the best option to decarbonise aviation with 91% supporting the UK government investing in hydrogen production and use in the aviation sector.

London, 5 September 2023 – A group of leading companies in the UK aviation and renewable energy sectors including easyJet, Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Ørsted, GKN Aerospace and Bristol Airport, have today established the Hydrogen in Aviation (HIA) alliance to accelerate the delivery of zero carbon aviation. HIA will work to ensure the UK capitalises on the huge opportunity hydrogen presents to both the aviation industry and country as a whole.

While there are various options for decarbonising the aviation sector, including sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), synthetic fuels or batteries, HIA believes that more attention should be paid to the potential of the direct use of hydrogen.

Hydrogen is a very promising alternative-fuel option for short-haul aviation. Airbus is developing new hydrogen powered aircraft with the aim of entering commercial service from 2035 and Rolls-Royce has already proven that hydrogen could power a jet engine following successful ground tests in 2022. Furthermore, many smaller operators are making rapid progress on hydrogen-powered aircraft, notably ZeroAvia and Universal Hydrogen who have already carried out flight tests.

The group will be drawing on their considerable expertise to propose a clear and deliverable pathway to achieving hydrogen-powered aviation. HIA will work constructively with Government, local authorities, and the aviation and hydrogen sectors to enable the UK to fulfil its potential as a global leader in this critical application of hydrogen technology. This will include setting out the pathway for scaling up the infrastructure and the policy, regulatory and safety frameworks needed so that large scale commercial aviation can become a reality.

The alliance will set out that Government needs to be focused on three key areas which are; supporting the delivery of the infrastructure needed for the UK to be a global leader; ensuring the aviation regulatory regime is hydrogen ready; and transforming the funding for hydrogen aviation R&D support into a 10 year programme, if the UK is to see the economic benefits and meet decarbonisation targets.

Johan Lundgren, CEO of easyJet and first Chair of HIA, said:

“There is no doubt that the UK has the potential to become a world leader in hydrogen aviation, which could bring with it a £34bn per annum boost to the country’s economy by 2050, but in order to capture this opportunity, rapid change is needed and the time to act is now.

“We must work together to deliver the radical solutions required for a hard to abate industry like aviation so we can protect and maximise the benefits that it brings to the UK economy and society and that we know British consumers want to be preserved.

“HIA looks forward to working with the UK Government to ensure the right funding, regulatory and policy changes are implemented to accelerate the delivery of zero carbon aviation.”

Grazia Vittadini, Chief Technology Officer at Rolls-Royce, said:

“Collaboration is key when it comes to achieving our net zero ambitions as an industry, which is why we are proud to be part of the Hydrogen in Aviation Alliance. Our contribution to HIA is the capability and experience we have in pioneering new technologies and solutions - we have already tested a modern aero engine on green hydrogen and we strongly believe it is one of the solutions that will help decarbonise aviation in the mid to long-term.”

Sabine Klauke, Chief Technology Officer at Airbus said:

“As Airbus continues to mature the aircraft technologies needed to deliver hydrogen-powered flight, a united industry voice is needed to secure a robust ecosystem of renewably-sourced hydrogen. Joining our peers from across the UK aviation landscape in a targeted approach to policy and investment action brings us closer to a decarbonised future of flying.""

Olivia Breese, Senior Vice President and Head of Power-to-X for Ørsted, commented:

“Ørsted is fully committed to renewable hydrogen as a key solution to defossilise hard-to-electrify sectors such as aviation. Our long experience in developing and deploying new technologies has taught us that collaboration across policy makers, developers, customers and supply chain - and considerable investment from each of them – is critical to bring down costs and drive a new sector to scale. Alliances such as the HIA are essential to bring together different actors across the value chain to support and accelerate the role hydrogen can, and must, play in the UK.”

Hydrogen is key to UK industry, jobs and net zero ambitions:

Experts suggest that hydrogen powered aviation will not only be critical in delivering net zero, but also provide a significant boost to the UK economy.

The DfT’s Jet Zero Strategy states that rapid investment in hydrogen aviation could see the UK securing 60,000 new jobs and recent projections from Hydrogen UK** predicts that hydrogen could contribute to £18bn GVA and help meet up to 50% of our energy demand by 2050.

The rate of research and development within the UK means that the aviation sector is already in an advanced position to take advantage of this significant opportunity. For instance, last year saw the first ground test of a fully hydrogen-powered jet engine and the first hydrogen powered narrow-body aircraft is expected to be ready for short-haul flights across the UK and Europe by 2035.

The benefits of hydrogen-powered flight are many and varied:

Decarbonising aviation is a significant challenge which will require the successful deployment and implementation of multiple technologies and approaches, including SAF, as well as hydrogen. However, the use of hydrogen (particularly green hydrogen) has potential as an aircraft fuel as it produces no carbon emissions, compared to other technologies.

It will help to preserve an industry that is a key part of our economy. The UK aviation industry contributes more than £22bn directly to GDP, plus £34 bn from exporting aerospace components. The industry directly employs over 230,000 people.

Investing in hydrogen will also help to preserve the social benefits of flying, continuing to connect consumers to business, loved ones and new destinations.

And lastly it will create jobs. In terms of hydrogen, a consultation from the government in 2021*** revealed that developing a UK hydrogen economy could support over 9,000 jobs by 2030 – and up to 100,000 jobs by 2050 – across our industrial heartlands and across the UK.

The UK is in a strong position to lead the global roll-out of hydrogen in aviation. If we maximise this potential we can transition and upskill existing workforces, whilst creating thousands more jobs through exporting UK-made technologies and knowledge.

The public support for hydrogen in the UK is strong:

New research**** of consumer attitudes towards zero-carbon emission solutions has revealed that 81% of the British public believe that hydrogen is the best option to decarbonise aviation. Four in 10 think it’s the most important factor while a similar number say they understand it will take hydrogen combined with other solutions such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Direct Air Carbon Capture (DACC) to reach net zero.

The overwhelming majority of Brits (91%) would support the UK government investing both in hydrogen’s production and use in the aviation sector, and a similar proportion (89%) think that the use of hydrogen should be prioritised for hard to abate sectors like aviation. The nationwide study of 2,000 Brits conducted by HIA founding member easyJet, revealed that half 50% of those surveyed wanted to see the ability to travel the world protected and almost three quarters (71%) are excited to fly on hydrogen planes in the future.

A third also said they believed the aviation sector plays a critical role in helping boost the UK’s economy, while a fifth of people (20%) agree the sector plays a critical role in people’s livelihoods and 92% agree there is a potential to create many new jobs across the UK if the government invests more into new zero carbon industries and 87% are excited for the economic potential of a new sustainable energy economy.

'En-route' to certification – the A321XLR embarks on first international test flights - Airbus,"Wed, 13 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTA5LWVuLXJvdXRlLXRvLWNlcnRpZmljYXRpb24tdGhlLWEzMjF4bHItZW1iYXJrcy1vbi1maXJzdC1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXRlc3TSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The A321XLR programme has just kicked-off an international flight-test campaign, known as ‘Functional and Reliability Testing’ (FnR). Also referred to as ‘Route Proving’, this is part of Airbus’ certification activity contributing to EASA Type Certification expected for the new variant in 2024.

Overall, the main objective of the FnR is to demonstrate the A321XLR’s systems maturity well before entry into service, with a target of approximately 100 hours flying time over 10 days with no systems power-down. Specific sectors, comprising around 15 flights in total, are intentionally typical of what airlines might fly when the aircraft enters service. These have been defined to represent a mix of operator profiles, climatic conditions, flight durations and airport turnaround times.

For the first time since the A321XLR first flew in June 2022, there will be real airline cabin and flight crews gaining hands-on experience, alongside the Airbus test pilots and flight engineers as well as a representative group of around 30 passengers made up of volunteer Airbus and airline employees. Everyone on board, as well as myriad supporting teams on the ground in Toulouse and also at the destination airports, will contribute to a common objective to provide valuable feedback as the A321XLR spreads its wings for the first time, crossing oceans and visiting international airports. The aircraft which is flying these missions is ‘MSN 11080’ – one of three dedicated flight test prototypes, and the only one which is equipped with a full cabin interior.

“In the olden days ‘route proving’ was very much about showing customers the aircraft in action – that the aircraft they have bought can actually do what they want to do with it,” recalls Jim Fawcett, Airbus’ Lead Flight Test Engineer for the A321XLR’s FnR exercise.

“These days we carry on with this kind of demonstration, but we're also looking at showing the technical reliability and maturity and good functioning of the aircraft. So that's why we prefer to call it ‘functional and reliability testing’.”

Mission drivers

There are several drivers, explains Fawcett. “One is a certification requirement and it's actually written down in the EASA rules and regulations. While there are similar things on the FAA side, we're getting an EASA type certificate to start off with, and this requires us to conduct 150 hours of flying which has to represent routine airline-like operations and do so safely under all normal dispatch conditions. Moreover, EASA recommends that this testing is undertaken working with an operator, in our case an airline.”

He adds: “The flying has to be done on a single aircraft, flying on a continuous schedule, and its configuration needs to be as close as possible to the final ‘Type’ design. This is why we perform this exercise in the second half of the overall certification campaign, as it allows us to have completed all the independent intermediate development cycles and thus have the latest software standards loaded.”

Furthermore, the operation should represent typical in-service ambient conditions. “We're therefore looking to go somewhere a bit warm, and a bit cold – to different airfields in terms of their infrastructure, location, weather and runway altitudes. So if we can tick all of those boxes as well, then it makes it a much more representative demonstration,” says Fawcett.

Accelerating systems maturity

Complementing this certification-related activity, Airbus has also set itself additional requirements, which are all about improving the maturity of its systems. “We know from previous experience that sometimes we test and develop and certify systems which work fine on a short flight and over a short duration. But as soon as they get into regular service and they're operated continuously for days on end, then some systems can succumb to ‘infant mortality’. Airlines can therefore experience early failures quickly, unsurprisingly, since they build-up many operational flight-hours and flight-cycles in a relatively short period of time.”

Fortunately, to address that issue, Airbus has set up an internal development activity called maturity testing – which is part of the rationale that the aircraft remains powered-on for the whole of the 10 days campaign window – which is quite representative of what happens in an airline operational environment. Moreover, the objective is not to do that in addition to the certification activity. The objective is to do them in parallel. “We're not looking at doing 150 plus 100 hours. Rather, we're looking at fulfilling a subset of those hours.”

Another key driver is the traditional ‘route proving’ exercise where Airbus has the opportunity to work early-on with its customers to show them that it will deliver what it had promised – and also to receive their very early feedback on what they think of the aircraft and benefit from their operational expertise.

Campaign structure

The first part of the maturity campaign involves the aircraft flying various trips of several hours each, from Toulouse and back to Toulouse – one of these will approach the North Pole and then circle-back to Toulouse, for example. Others will fly around Europe. The second part will explore transatlantic operations into and from a US gateway airport. Over the course of the 10 days there will be numerous airline and Airbus flight-crew changes in between the various sectors.

Crucial to the whole operation are also the ground crews – who will be pre-positioned at each end to ‘turn-around’ the aircraft as if it was in real airline service. “We will have maintenance teams provided by Airbus at each base,” notes Fawcett. “They will be working with our airline customers in terms of providing us with a fuel truck or a catering service or a water and waste servicing truck – all those kinds of things in just the same way as the airlines do on any of their rotations on any day of the week.”

In parallel, Airbus’ Maintenance Control Center (MCC) in Toulouse will be following the aircraft 24 hours a day. They will be able to identify upcoming maintenance issues because they can receive data directly from the aircraft by its standard ACARS data link, just as an airline would.

Post campaign feedback assessment phase

After the flights themselves are completed, the FnR campaign swings into its next phase which addresses the aspects of certification reporting as well as Airbus’ own internal development activity.

“For our certification obligation we will provide a report to EASA within two weeks of the end of the exercise, as we have to present the proof that we have completed the 150 hours which are needed for the regulation point of view. We also have to list any failures and that we were able to continue operating safely in accordance with our Master Minimum Equipment List (MMEL).”

He adds: “That's one of the elements, which needs to go into the overall dossier for the type certification of the aircraft, then EASA will process all of the documentation for the certification flight test campaign.”

In terms of Airbus’ own internal development objectives related to the maturity campaign, there will be a great deal more retrospective assessment, not only from the customers’ observations and feedback, but also from the on-board Flight Test Instrumentation (FTI) recorded data that allows the engineers to see where systems have worked well or not, and to see what can be done to rectify any problems.

Notably, there will be a window of opportunity between when the aircraft is certified (Type Certification) and when the first customers use it (Entry Into Service – EIS) to further update the definition of the aircraft. As a result, the first aircraft to be delivered to the launch customers will benefit from any feedback which has been gleaned from the whole of the flight test campaign, not just from the FnR.

Designed to be operated just like a regular A321neo

A very practical and positive measure of the success arising from the campaign, would be if the crews and passengers on board, as well as the ground support teams, were to say that they see very little difference between operating an A321XLR and the regular A321neo.

“If our participants tell us that they see very little difference versus the A321s in current operation, then to be honest, Airbus as an organisation will have done our job,” emphasises Fawcett.

This would indeed align with the fact that many of the A321XLR’s changes are ‘behind-the-scenes’. “For example, it's about making sure that the aircraft is capable of safely taking off at a higher weight than before,” says Fawcett. “This is possible thanks to some structural and aerodynamic control-surface optimisations – which in turn have required corresponding adaptations and re-tuning required for the flight control laws. The aircraft also features an uprated landing gear system, matched to the aircraft’s extra weight and rolling speeds, and without the ride being uncomfortable.”

Regarding the interior environment, whilst it may be based on the same Airspace cabin as for A321neos being delivered today, there are new behind-the-scenes changes – such as the thermal and acoustic insulation as well the ventilation and heating systems. These features have been enhanced especially for the -XLR since this variant will naturally spend longer at high altitudes for extended periods, compared with the regular A321neo.

“In a nutshell, during and following this exercise, what we really want our experts, our airline and airport partners and passengers to say is: ‘This aircraft is good. It's exactly like what we know and it's just giving us that extra boost of range that we needed.’ That's the whole ‘name of the game’ – the A321XLR is supposed to be integrated easily into their existing fleets,” he concludes."
What makes the A321XLR so attractive to airlines? - Airbus,"Tue, 19 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTA5LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIxeGxyLXRoZS1uZXR3b3JrLW9wZW5lci10aGF0LXB1dHMtZGlzdGFudC1jaXRpZXMtd2l0aGluLXJlYWNo0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As the Airbus A321XLR embarks on its September route-proving campaign, Airbus marketing specialist Ludek Jando explains the aircraft’s unique appeal. What modifications are needed to fly a single-aisle plane for up to 11 hours?

Ludek, what makes the A321XLR so attractive to airlines?

It’s the single-aisle Xtra-Long-Range route opener! The A321XLR is the latest chapter in the A320 Family programme’s continuous development.

The A321XLR sits side by side with widebodies in an airline’s fleet. It introduces the flexibility to add capacity, to open new routes, or even to continue operating existing ones when demand is variable. All while burning 30% less fuel per seat than previous generation competitor aircraft, at roughly half the trip cost of modern widebodies.

This versatility explains why Airbus has received more than 550 orders so far, from over 25 customers!

Simply put, the A321XLR is a network extender. And thanks to the Airspace cabin, fitted as standard, it can be configured to combine comfort with density in line with airline requirements.

How is A321XLR different from a classical A321neo?

First of all, the A321XLR is a member of the A320 Family like any other. That eases entry into service for customers already operating the type, in terms of spare parts management or crew rostering for example.

Structurally, the key addition is the rear centre tank with a capacity of 12,900 litres of fuel. Along with an optional additional centre tank, it extends the A321XLR’s maximum range to 4,700 nautical miles or 11 hours of flying time.

To make full use of this new fuel capacity, the A321XLR’s maximum takeoff weight is increased compared to the A321LR (Long Range), weighing in at 101 tonnes compared to 97 tonnes. Then we reinforced the main and nose landing gear, and of course increased the A321XLR’s water-carrying capacity to cater to those longer flights.

What’s the market perception of single-aisle long-haul travel?

Top of the list, even well-established city pairs such as London-Miami or Sydney-Kuala Lumpur will benefit from the year-round sweet spot the XLR offers airlines.

In fact we’ve already had great feedback from A321LR customers. When Airbus showcased a jetBlue A321LR at this year’s Paris Air Show, for example, its level of comfort in both business and economy class wowed the public.

Our customers regularly tell us how passengers find the aircraft roomier and more comfortable than they expected, especially with a generous seat pitch and, above all, Airspace cabin enablers like mood lighting or our XL bins.

So my own feeling is that single-aisle long-haul is the future.

Moreover, as part of the certification campaign, we'll be putting over 200 passionate Airbus employees who've worked on the programme onboard our full-cabin test aircraft in early October to experience the fully-equipped cabin for themselves.

Most importantly, they'll provide our experts with early feedback on every aspect of passenger life onboard the A321XLR. Stay tuned!"

Consortium lays pathway for green hydrogen aviation to take flight in New Zealand - Airbus,"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0wOS1jb25zb3J0aXVtLWxheXMtcGF0aHdheS1mb3ItZ3JlZW4taHlkcm9nZW4tYXZpYXRpb24tdG8tdGFrZS1mbGlnaHTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The potential for up to 900,000 tonnes of carbon emissions to be avoided every year by 2050 through use of liquid hydrogen-fuelled aircraft.

Consortium calling for cross-party support and for the New Zealand Government to take a key role in enabling green hydrogen aviation.

A new report called ‘Launching green hydrogen powered aviation in Aotearoa New Zealand’ demonstrates how the consortium members could work together to remove up to 900,000 tonnes of carbon emissions every year by 2050 through the use of hydrogen-fuelled aircraft flying New Zealand domestic routes.

The Report has just been released by the New Zealand Hydrogen Aviation Consortium – a partnership of six international businesses Airbus, Air New Zealand, Christchurch Airport, Fortescue, Hiringa Energy and Fabrum.

Launched in February 2023, the Consortium has spent the last six months examining the hydrogen supply chain, evaluating the local aviation market’s projected hydrogen requirements, and scoping what it would take to establish a successful hydrogen ecosystem for aviation in New Zealand.

The Consortium has also developed recommendations for the regulations and incentives needed to support the transition to a green hydrogen aviation system.

Airbus is working to develop the world’s first hydrogen aircraft for commercial use.

Its ZEROe Ecosystem Vice President, Karine Guenan says New Zealand is uniquely positioned to lead the testing and deployment of low carbon aircraft.

“The country’s large potential renewable electricity and water resources are key advantages while the size of aircraft used here and the length of routes flown match the capabilities of hydrogen-powered aircraft. This report lays out the ecosystem required to make that happen. It is a first step and Airbus is committed to leveraging our expertise to work with government, iwi, industries and other stakeholders to bring it to life,” says Guenan.

Christchurch-based company Fabrum is already working on hydrogen aviation projects overseas. Its Chairman and Co-Founder Christopher Boyle says green hydrogen is an important part of the future of clean flight.

“Our team co-developed the world’s first electric aircraft engine for Magnix and built superconducting electric motors and rotors for SAFRAN and Airbus. We’re currently manufacturing green hydrogen systems for airports and on-board liquid hydrogen tanks for low emission flights.The opportunity to use our experience to ensure green hydrogen aviation takes off in New Zealand is exciting.”

Air New Zealand Chief Sustainability Officer, Kiri Hannifin says the Report provides information that could be used to build out a blueprint for hydrogen-powered aviation in New Zealand.

“Air New Zealand is committed to decarbonising its operations. Green hydrogen fuelled aircraft is one of the potential levers we have available to us. This report provides important proof points for both the aviation sector and decision-makers to work together to make that happen.”

The Report shows that to enable green hydrogen aviation to take-off, New Zealand will need to:

Scale affordable new generation renewable energy in New Zealand to support the production of green hydrogen.

Develop the transmission and distribution capacity to move that renewable electricity to where it is needed

Develop policies and regulations to create and support a green hydrogen ecosystem.

Develop a range of new systems and processes to ensure the safe production, distribution and use of green hydrogen.

Become more cost-effective to produce and supply green hydrogen to ensure its commercial viability.

The Consortium’s modelling shows New Zealand could use up to 100,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per year for hydrogen-fuelled aircraft by 2050 with most of it required to fuel planes at Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch airports.

Christchurch Airport General Manager Future Planning and Sustainability Nick Flack says up to 6,700-gigawatt hours of renewable energy will be required to generate that green hydrogen.

“That’s up to 16% of New Zealand’s current total electricity supply. That demand presents an opportunity for businesses. We’ve now committed to progressing a hydrogen hub as part of our 400-hectare renewable energy precinct, Kōwhai Park. Twenty other airports around the world are doing the same,” says Flack.

Fortescue’s Global Aviation Lead Amy Barrett says while establishing green hydrogen aviation in New Zealand will be challenging, the report indicates it’s a practical and implementable solution.

“Aviation, like our own iron ore operations, is one of the hard-to-abate sectors. Hard-to-abate doesn’t mean impossible to decarbonise – it just requires a lot of effort and long-term commitment. It also needs collaboration, and that’s what we are doing here, we know we need to work together to find the best solutions.”

Hiringa Energy Chief Executive, Andrew Clennett, says the report highlights the need to have physical and regulatory infrastructure in place to enable low emission aircraft to be trialled and deployed in New Zealand.

“Green hydrogen is integral to the decarbonisation of New Zealand’s domestic aviation network, and why it made perfect sense for Hiringa to join the consortium. By sharing our first-hand technical, operational and commercial expertise, we hope to accelerate New Zealand’s already thriving green hydrogen landscape, and lead the world in the transition to clean aviation.”

About green hydrogen aviation

For airlines to meet their ambitions to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, they need to phase out the use of fossil fuels.

Green hydrogen is one of the potential solutions the global aviation sector is planning to use to achieve that ambition. Others include Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) which can cut emissions by up to 80%, electric, battery-electric aircraft, infrastructure and operational efficiencies, and offsets and carbon capture.

Fuelling transport with green hydrogen helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It’s already being used to fuel cars, buses, trucks and boats (including professional sailing team Emirates Team New Zealand’s America’s Cup chase boat, Chase Zero).

Hydrogen fuel cells have been successfully trialed to power aircraft overseas. The next step is to design technology to enable liquid hydrogen, which is more energy dense and easier to transport than gaseous hydrogen, to power aircraft.

Hydrogen-powered technology will likely be best suited for medium-sized aircraft seating 20 to 200 passengers and flying distances from around 200 to 2,000km and potentially up to around 3,500km.

Air New Zealand

Air New Zealand's story started in 1940, first taking to the skies between Auckland and Sydney on a flying boat.

Known for its warm Kiwi hospitality, today the airline has 106 operating aircraft ranging from Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners and Airbus A320s to ATRs and Q300s.

Air New Zealand has a well-connected domestic business, connecting customers and cargo to 20 different regions around New Zealand.

Internationally, the airline has direct flights to major cities across Australia, Asia, the Pacific Islands and the U.S., and through its strong relationships with alliance partners, offers customers more choice and convenience to connect further afield to hundreds of destinations.

Air New Zealand has a particular focus on sustainability and its Sustainability Framework helps guide the airline's efforts in tackling some of New Zealand's and the world's most complex challenges.

Airbus Direct Air Capture team reaches the finals of the German Future Prize - Airbus,"Wed, 13 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0wOS1haXJidXMtZGlyZWN0LWFpci1jYXB0dXJlLXRlYW0tcmVhY2hlcy10aGUtZmluYWxzLW9mLXRoZS1nZXJtYW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Munich, 13 September 2023 – A team of two engineers and a developer is one of the three shortlisted teams to win the German Future Prize (Deutscher Zukunftspreis) 2023 with its entry of the development of Direct Air Capture technology to remove CO 2 from the atmosphere. The prize is awarded by the German Federal President in recognition of scientific excellence, coupled with scientific application, that benefits society. The Direct Air Capture (DAC) process extracts carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) directly from ambient air and stores or reuses it for industrial purposes. DAC is one of several complementary technologies that Airbus is embracing in its efforts to decarbonise and reduce CO 2 emissions in the aviation industry.

“I would like to congratulate the team: Antje Bulmann, Viktor Fetter and Tobias Horn. The trio’s achievement in producing the DAC modules is a perfect example of how technologies from the space industry can be refined for use on Earth and help to reduce CO 2 emissions,” said Airbus Chief Technical Officer, Dr Sabine Klauke.

The Airbus team’s DAC modules are an adaptation of an adsorber technology that is used on the International Space Station (ISS), where it is needed to reliably remove the CO 2 exhaled by astronauts from the atmosphere on board. These new DAC modules are now performing the same task here on Earth. The CO 2 is extracted from the air by means of an absorptive DAC process. To achieve this, Airbus has cooperated on the development of an amine resin that efficiently captures CO 2 even at low concentrations. First, a fan draws in air, which flows over a solid amine filter that selectively binds the CO 2 . The processed air that is then released contains practically no CO 2 . This phase lasts until the resin is saturated with the greenhouse gas. The second stage involves heating the filter, regenerating it and desorbing a concentrated stream of CO 2 , which can either be repurposed or sequestered (stored underground).

Airbus is working in parallel on a series of technologies in its efforts to reduce CO 2 emissions in the aviation industry. In addition to fleet modernisation and more efficient air traffic management, these include Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) and, in the long term, DAC and hydrogen.

How to Make a Wing - Airbus,"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTA5LWhvdy10by1tYWtlLWEtd2luZ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In the last episode, we looked at how wings work. But how does Airbus make them? Our Wing of Tomorrow research programme is examining the technologies and industrial systems that could help lift a new, low-carbon aircraft into the skies. But first, let’s take a look at how wings are manufactured today.

Of course, it’s Airbus’ passionate assembly workers who bolt our wings together. We’re exploring some 100 new technologies to assist them, and advance the way we design and manufacture wings. It’s our largest ongoing research project, and it’s called Wing of Tomorrow.

Wing of Tomorrow aims to mature a selection of disruptive approaches that could help bring a new, low-carbon aircraft into service. Some may even be applicable to current Airbus platforms.

But first, today. How does Airbus produce the wings that carry half of the world’s passengers?

Piecing the puzzle together

At Airbus, assembling and equipping wings is a little like a puzzle.

Take the A350. In common with all Airbus Commercial Aircraft programmes, the wings’ composite covers and other components such as spars and ribs are manufactured at multiple Airbus sites and in the supply chain. Operators then assemble the wings at our Broughton plant in the UK.

Each completed A350 wingset is flown by BelugaXL air transporter to Toulouse operating on a blend of 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), where it is joined to the centre wing box and fuselage during final assembly.

Before this production puzzle can be completed, a lot needs to happen. The process starts well upstream, with the Overall Aircraft Design. This determines the wing’s shape and characteristics, including flight controls and high lift systems.

A so-called ‘co-design’ phase then begins. A wing’s structural design is matured in parallel with the industrial system required to produce it.

Longer, leaner, lighter

In the future, wings will be produced with higher levels of automation. Using a process called ‘design for manufacture’, Airbus engineers will identify the best balance between manual and automated assembly, ensuring the wings are produced right the first time, every time, at the right cost.

The next generation of wings will be longer, leaner and lighter. When combined, these characteristics help an aircraft attain lift using less fuel, which in turn produces fewer CO₂ emissions.

This change in wing design must be met with a change in wing production. Airbus’ industrial system needs to be equipped to cost-effectively produce such a lightweight wing at volume and pace. The shift requires a radical rethink, and that’s where Wing of Tomorrow comes in.

Caption: Up close and personal with one of Wing of Tomorrow demonstrator wings.

Its purpose is to prepare not only the technologies needed for the next generation of aircraft; but employees, the supply chain, the industrial system, and the company’s physical and digital capabilities, too.

All will work together to bring the agility required to scale up production at speed, while considering the effect on the operators who make the wings every day.

Shorter production cycles

Wing of Tomorrow is leading Airbus into a new age of industrial capability, as a testbed for new manufacturing and automation techniques that bring efficiency and ergonomic improvements together.

For example, production could see the introduction of multi-product moving pulse lines, akin to an automotive facility. This would allow Airbus to work on multiple parts of the wing concurrently, and enable shorter production cycles for faster assembly. Drilling automation for instance not only shortens lead times; it frees up skilled operators for higher value-added tasks.

Airbus is also using digital modelling to inform the design of future wing factories, making the best use of such new technologies to optimise production time. This digital model of operations, known as the ‘digital twin’, helps Airbus to assess the impact of each assembly process in terms of most efficient use of materials, reduction of waste and carbon emissions.

More in the next episode about what the Wing of Tomorrow could look like, and how Airbus is borrowing from nature to help with the heavy lifting. Stay tuned!

Dawn of the demos

Assembled at the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) in Broughton, UK, three full-sized Wing demonstrators will be used to assess different aspects of building next-generation wings.

The demonstrators are all made from lightweight composites and have been produced in collaboration with 40 worldwide partners, with an overall aim of identifying any bottlenecks that might prevent the technologies they feature being used in future generations of aircraft.

The three full-size demonstrators are:

Static wing demonstrator - used to test the structural capabilities of new designs and materials.

Fully-equipped demonstrator - used to test installation technologies and novel approaches to equipping the next generation of wings with systems.

Run@rate demonstrator - used to test Airbus’ industrial capability and automation technologies to assess how to build wings at scale and pace."
Airbus A320neo Pratt Engine Issues to Ground 650 Planes Next Year - Skift,"Tue, 12 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZXdlZWtseS5za2lmdC5jb20vMjAyMy8wOS9haXJidXMtYTMyMG5lby1wcmF0dC1lbmdpbmUtaXNzdWVzLXRvLWdyb3VuZC02NTAtcGxhbmVzLW5leHQteWVhci_SAXBodHRwczovL2FpcmxpbmV3ZWVrbHkuc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjMvMDkvYWlyYnVzLWEzMjBuZW8tcHJhdHQtZW5naW5lLWlzc3Vlcy10by1ncm91bmQtNjUwLXBsYW5lcy1uZXh0LXllYXIvP2FtcD0x?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The quality issues affecting Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engines on Airbus A320neo-family aircraft will ground 600 to 650 aircraft globally next year, the latest setback to the airline industry’s recovery and growth from the pandemic.

Executives at RTX, which owns P&W, said Monday that an average of 350 A320neo-family planes will be grounded as geared turbofan engine inspections and repairs occur. The number is expected to peak at 600-650 aircraft in the first half of 2024, or about half of the global fleet of the 1,360 geared turbofan-equipped A320neos, Cirium fleet data shows.

To put it in perspective, the largest airline in the world, American Airlines, only has 925 mainline planes.

“We don’t like the situation but think it’s the right thing to do,” Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Global Aerospace Summit in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. He added that there will be “a lot of consequences on the [airline] industry.”

RTX first unveiled the production quality issues in geared turbofan engines in July. At the time, it said roughly 1,200 engines needed to be inspected within 12 months. The company has since determined that the quality issues affect some 3,000 engines with an estimated 600-700 likely needing repair. Aircraft will be grounded during repairs, which involves removing engines from the wings, and will take through 2026. The majority of inspections and repairs will occur next year. Repairs will take more than half a year, or 250-300 days.

“This will have significant impact on us, and any other A320neo operator,” Lufthansa Group CEO Carsten Spohr said at the U.S. Chamber summit Tuesday.

Lufthansa expects roughly 20 of its A320neos will be grounded — up from just three aircraft in July — at any given time through next year, he said. The airline will backfill that lost capacity by extending the lives of older A320ceo aircraft, as well as wet-leasing narrowbody planes from other airlines.

“There are less aircraft available in total than we were expecting,” Spohr said. “We were expecting to grow that by about double digit, and maybe it’s a little less.”

Not every airline is able to maintain its capacity outlook save a percentage point or two. European discounter Wizz Air, which operates an all-Airbus narrowbody fleet, on Monday cut its capacity growth forecast by 10 percentage points for the six months ending next March.

Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways, IndiGo, and Spirit Airlines all previously said the geared turbofan engine inspections would affect them this year and next. They have not provided new guidance following RTX’s update.

At the U.S. Chamber summit, JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes declined to comment on the impact of the latest geared turbofan engine update.

Fitch Ratings on Tuesday described the situation as “material” for Spirit, which operated 80 A320neo-family aircraft at the end of June, in the September quarter. The rating agency expects the issues for Spirit to continue into 2024."

This latest agreement is in addition to one announced in August for four A350-900s. Turkish Airlines already operates a fleet of 14 A350-900s.

Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer and Head of Airbus International, said, “We are delighted that Turkish Airlines has decided to further enlarge its fleet with the purchase of 10 more A350-900 aircraft. With greater range capability, passenger capacity and comfort, the A350 is the perfect platform to connect Istanbul to the world.

We are proud to keep expanding our long-lasting partnership with Turkish Airlines and Türkiye’s aviation sector overall.”

At the end of July, the A350 had won over 1,000 orders from leading carriers from around the globe. The A350 is the world’s most modern and efficient widebody aircraft and the long range leader in the 300-410 seater category. Its clean sheet design includes state-of-the-art technologies, aerodynamics, lightweight materials and new engines that together deliver 25 percent advantage in fuel burn, operating costs and CO2 emissions, as well as 50 percent noise footprint reduction compared to previous generation competitor aircraft.

Airbus Invests In Hydrogen-Electric Propulsion Pioneer ZeroAvia - Aviation Week,"Mon, 18 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvYWR2YW5jZWQtYWlyLW1vYmlsaXR5L2FpcmJ1cy1pbnZlc3RzLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWVsZWN0cmljLXByb3B1bHNpb24tcGlvbmVlci16ZXJvYXZpYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has joined the list of investors in hydrogen propulsion developer ZeroAvia, co-leading a new funding round with existing backers Barclays Sustainable Impact Capital and Saudi Arabia’s Neom.

As part of the investment, Airbus and ZeroAvia have agreed to collaborate on certification approaches for hydrogen power systems and work together on key technologies including liquid hydrogen (LH 2 ) storage, ground and flight testing of fuel cell propulsion systems, and development of hydrogen refueling infrastructure and operations.

Airbus has previously invested in fuel-cell powertrain developer Universal Hydrogen.

ZeroAvia has not disclosed the value of the investment round or the total funding raised so far. ""For legal reasons, we are not disclosing this investment size at this stage, but this is our largest financing round to date,"" ZeroAvia said Sept. 18. ""However, for context, Series B was $72 million and Series A was $56 million total.

ZeroAvia says the new funding round will progress its first product, the 600-kW ZA600 hydrogen-electric powertrain, through to certification as well as support development of the larger, 2.5-4-megawatt ZA2000 and in-house development of high-temperature fuel cells, electric motors, power electronics and LH 2 storage.

The startup has completed an initial campaign of flight tests with a ZA600 powertrain demonstrator in a Dornier 228 testbed and is finalizing the design ahead of applying for certification with the UK Civil Aviation Authority. ZeroAvia is targeting market entry in 2025 with supplemental type certification of a retrofit for the Cessna Caravan.

Under its ZEROe initiative to develop technologies for a hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft that could enter service by 2035, Airbus is developing its own megawatt-class fuel cell engine demonstrator for flight testing on an A380 testbed in 2026. “For ZeroAvia to now have investors such as Airbus coming on board is the strongest possible validation of the prospects for hydrogen-electric propulsion technology,” said Val Miftakhov, ZeroAvia’s founder and CEO.

Airbus highlighted the startup’s test progress with the 228 flights as well as its efforts to deploy hydrogen infrastructure for aviation. “ZeroAvia is supporting the development of a wider hydrogen ecosystem for aviation—technologies, decarbonized hydrogen supply and certification of hydrogen propulsion systems—which all complement well with our own ambition to bring a ZEROe hydrogen-powered aircraft to service by 2035,” Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus vice president for ZEROe aircraft, said in a statement.

In August 2021, Airbus Ventures participated in Universal Hydrogen’s $20.5 million Series A funding round. The U.S. startup is flight-testing a megawatt-scale fuel cell powertrain demonstrator and plans to certify a hydrogen-electric propulsion retrofit for the ATR 72 regional turboprop.

As well as Airbus, Barclays and Neom, existing investors Alaska Airlines, Amazon Climate Pledge Fund, AP Ventures, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Ecosystem Integrity Fund, Horizons Ventures and Summa Equity also participated in ZeroAvia’s latest funding round. ZeroAvia has previously secured investment also from American Airlines, International Airlines Group, Shell Ventures and United Airlines."
Pirated Software Likely Cause of Airbus Breach - Infosecurity Magazine,"Fri, 15 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZm9zZWN1cml0eS1tYWdhemluZS5jb20vbmV3cy9waXJhdGVkLXNvZnR3YXJlLWNhdXNlLWFpcmJ1cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A major data breach at Airbus revealed earlier this week stemmed from a RedLine info-stealer likely hidden in a pirated copy of Microsoft software, according to researchers.

The European aerospace giant said it has launched an investigation into the incident.

“As a major high-tech and industrial player, Airbus is also a target for malicious actors,” it noted in a statement.

“Airbus takes cybersecurity seriously and continuously monitors activities on its IT systems, has solid protection tools, skilled cyber experts and associated processes to protect the company by taking immediate and appropriate measures as and when needed.”

A threat actor known as “USDoD,” claiming to work as part of the Ransomed ransomware group, posted the breached data to the BreachForums site, according to cyber-intelligence firm Hudson Rock.

Personal information associated with 3200 Airbus vendors such as Rockwell Collins and Thales Group was apparently featured in the data dump – including names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses.

The threat actor’s claim that this had come from “employee access from a Turkish Airline” was confirmed by Hudson Rock.

“The computer belongs to an employee of Turkish Airlines and contains third-party login credential details for Airbus. The victim likely attempted to download a pirated version of the Microsoft .NET framework, as indicated in the malware path,” it explained.

“Consequently, they fell victim to a threat actor utilizing the commonly employed RedLine info-stealing family.”

Worryingly, USDoD has hinted that more victims in the aerospace industry may soon suffer the same fate, including US defense contractors Lockheed Martin and Raytheon.

The threat actor was previously thought to be responsible for compromising the FBI’s InfraGard information-sharing network.

Samantha Humphries, senior director of international security strategy at Exabeam, argued that tabletop exercises, credential monitoring and breach response planning are necessary to help mitigate supply chain risk.

“Realistically, security leaders must play a part in due diligence discussions around supplier risk, but also implement processes and monitoring to ensure they can detect and respond to supply chain attacks,” she added.

“This is ultimately part of the cost of doing business, and should be seen as a business enabler, as well as a key focus from a risk and compliance perspective.”"

During the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s 2023 Global Aerospace Summit , Guillaume Faury, CEO of Airbus , shared his insights on the current state and future of the aviation industry.

Consumer Demand for Flights Continues to Increase, While Supply Stays Stagnant

“The market in terms of flight [traffic] has really recovered compared to 2019,” said Faury. “There's probably more demand than supply for flight tickets.”

Faury further elaborated upon the huge gap between demand and supply – he cited that in 2019, Airbus delivered 863 planes, while in 2022, the company delivered 661. Airbus’ 2022 target was 720 planes.

“We think we'll close the gap by 2025 or 2026,” added Faury. “But a lot of things are in flux and keep moving, so we have to be prudent when it comes to forecasting the future.”

Leasing aircraft, both short- and long-term, helped Airbus meet its demand in the past and could be a potential solution. The process allows airlines to operate aircraft without financial burden and provides a temporary increase in capacity.

“I think the lessors have been extremely critical to success,” said Faury. “A lot of planes that were delivered [during the pandemic] were financed by lessors, so this needs to be recognized.”

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Can Help Decarbonize the Aviation Industry

According to Faury, Airbus is “very committed to [the] decarbonization of aviation.” In support of this, the company is supporting the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“[We need] planes that can burn less fuel, and over time burn 100 percent of SAF instead of jet fuel,” he explained. “SAF is absolutely critical to the success of decarbonization.”

Alongside global partners in the aviation industry, such as Digifuel, Airbus has started to catalyze, enable, and support the ecosystem that accelerates the production and use of SAF.

“The aim is to produce half a million liters of SAF by 2026,” said Faury. “That would reduce the emission of carbon by 1.5 million tons of carbon a year. And the aim, as we see it, is to try to be as close as possible [to] 10 percent of use of SAF in this industry by 2030.”

The Recent Rise in Long-Haul International Travel Poses New Challenges

Faury cited that long-haul international travel to and from Asia is beginning to increase. The commercial airline industry has surpassed 2019 pre-pandemic levels in single-aisle plane travel and is nearly back on white-body, or twin-aisle, planes used for international travel.

“There’s a big question mark around… To what extent the international tensions, and especially between China and U.S., will undermine the recovery of the wide body activity to and from China,” Faury said.

The inability to use Russian airspace is also a significant roadblock for airlines as they increase capacity for long-haul international flights.

“Now post Ukraine, there are restrictions and [shared airspace] is no longer a common good,” explained Faury. “This has consequences on [airline] competitiveness and it's no longer a level playing field.”"

HBCplus is a flexible satellite connectivity solution Airbus introduced last year, that lets airlines connect with selected managed service providers and line-fit new aircraft or retrofit aircraft with certified terminals and radomes. Customers get a data routing plan for IFC service, and Airbus manages system installation in line and retrofit, as well as service support.

Intelsat and Panasonic Avionics are adding Ku-band, multi-orbit Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) and Geostationary Orbit (GEO) connectivity into the program. Both Intelsat and Panasonic are distributors of OneWeb’s LEO capacity. This announcement comes after Airbus announced an MoU with the satellite players earlier this year.

Airbus also selected Safran Passenger Innovations (SPI) as its Ku-band satcom hardware supplier, integrating Get-SAT’s electronically steerable antenna (ESA). Airbus said this antenna will offer simultaneous and multi-beam connectivity, with entry into service in 2026.

“As the aircraft OEM, Airbus is looking forward to delivering state-of-the-art built-in aircraft connectivity technology together with Safran Passenger Innovations, integrating Get-SAT’s electronically-steerable antenna to harness multiple satellite constellations. In parallel, our expanding catalog of selected managed service provider partners – now joined by Intelsat and Panasonic Avionics Corporation – will deliver a fantastic customer experience,” commented Airbus exec Maximilian Ruecker, vice president of Cabin Procurement Seats.

The HBCplus program currently includes Ka-band GEO and Medium-Earth Orbit (MEO) using SPI’s integrated terminal modem with Thinkom Solutions’ antenna, with Viasat and SES as the managed service providers."

Starting in January 2025, 38 of Lufthansa’s A320s will be refitted with the new bins providing 60% more bag capacity than the previous-generation A320 bins.

Airbus Head of Commercial Services Europe Charbel Youzkatli says, “We know from talking with airline customers that bigger bins are a clear need to enhance the passenger experience. As with the XL Bins, the L Bins provide more space with the added advantage of a plug and play retrofit. We are thrilled to see Lufthansa as the first to offer the L Bins to its passengers and to reap the efficiency benefits it brings to aircraft turnarounds.”

The benefits are wide ranging. L Bins are designed to be retrofitted in three to five days which is Airbus’ fastest and most cost effective A320 retrofit solution. This results in less aircraft downtime for the airline. Secondly, L Bins allow space for three extra bags per bin, creating a better experience for customers and crew when boarding and deplaning.

The bins, made of ultra-lightweight and highly stable composite products, will be manufactured by EFW (Elbe Flugzeugwerke GmbH). As with all Airbus retrofits, reusing the same components to minimise waste is a key consideration. The L Bin re-uses many parts of the original bin including the sidewall, ceiling and lighting.

New stowage dimensions

The new L Bins will be able to fit bags that are 61cm (height) x 38cm (width) x 25cm (depth)."

Her career, which spans 30 years, started in the US Navy, where she firmly situated herself as the only woman in her team, and one of the few women to perform search and rescue operations within the service. Reflecting on her experiences and the positive changes she has come to witness, Dawn imparts the importance of family, perseverance, and the impact of having a network of support.

Airbus Helicopters: Can you tell us about your current role and where you are based?

Dawn Kolbet: I am at Airbus in Columbus, Mississippi, where we do helicopter completions and final assembly lines, start to finish for civilian and military aircraft. I am a lead in the electrical back shop. We build the wiring harnesses for all the different systems aboard the aircraft. We also build for foreign entities and other Airbus affiliates. And we are also one of the very few who have a prototype wire stamping machine that we had the pleasure of getting from France. We are a pretty fast-paced, upscale, wiring harness shop.

Airbus Helicopters: What exactly inspired you to join the aerospace industry and start your career in the US Navy?

Dawn Kolbet: I wanted to pay tribute to one of my father's brothers. My dad is one of 10 children and one of his oldest brothers served in World War II and was lost at sea for 26 days as the result of being sunk at the Battle of Midway, and I made a choice to be his follow up in the military.

Also, I wanted to fly. I wanted to see what it was like to be somewhere other than a little bitty town in the US and see the world. And luckily, with the aerospace industry, that then turned into a career path that I have had now for 31 years.

Airbus Helicopters: What changes have you witnessed over the past few decades in the aviation sector?

Dawn Kolbet: What I have noticed is as technology has grown, women in aviation have also grown. We have also become a “let's work smarter, not harder” industry. It doesn't matter who brings their input to the table, what matters most is if it works. The biggest thing I've seen change in the STEM environment is it's become less taboo to not fit the status quo of what everybody else thinks the aerospace industry should look like. Some of the most intelligent minds in the aerospace industry today are women. And that to me is a huge improvement over three decades ago.

Airbus Helicopters: Is there any valuable advice that you'd like to impart or any recommendations you'd like to share with young girls aspiring to pursue a career in aviation or the STEM sector?

Dawn Kolbet: Actually, probably my best advice for any of them is to always remember that you're trailblazing. You're leaving a path behind you for others to get to follow in. So, if you're dead set to be that pilot, to be an A&P mechanic, a helicopter electrician, an avionics technician, whatever it is, the path is not completely paved - you’ve got to work for it. And a lot of times you'll have to work harder for it. But the one thing to remember is, the person coming behind you won't - they'll have it a little bit easier. They'll have a little less ground they have to conquer. And above all, you have to remember, no matter what you do, somebody sees you as a role model. So instead of trying to lead the people around you, be the steward of the people around you, find out what they need to succeed and help them get there.

Airbus Helicopters: What was the most empowering moment throughout the course of your career?

Dawn Kolbet: I am one of the first few women in the United States Navy to get the opportunity to do search and rescue, and I also am a crash survivor. However, probably the most amazing moment for me was earning my air crew wings. Being able to fly for the US military was one of the most empowering moments of my entire life.

Airbus Helicopters: What's something that you discovered about yourself over the past several years?

Dawn Kolbet: I think the biggest thing I've learned about myself is that it's OK to not be one of the boys. It's okay to stand out and step up and not be mediocre - it's okay to stand out and be exceptional at your job. And so, what I value the most is being able to be myself and succeed at what I do for a living while not having to feel like I have to be someone else.

Airbus Helicopters: What helped you remain focused on your goal and not feel like you had to be someone else?

Dawn Kolbet: My daughters. My daughters are the whole reason. I want women to encourage and be successful with other women. It doesn't have to be a competition. We can all succeed. We can all build each other up.

Airbus Helicopters: What role did mentorship play in your career choice?

Dawn Kolbet: Believe it or not, when I joined the Navy, I was the only woman in my shop. There were 35 of us, and I was the only female in the entire place. Luckily, I had a senior chief in the Navy who was very supportive. And he came from the world where his mom ruled the world. And he believed that if women didn't get treated equally, he was doing her a disservice. So even though he was male and I was female and there were 34 other guys, he still made me feel like I was as important as everybody else in the room. Also, my manager, believe it or not, has been very instrumental for me because he keeps making me a better person. I can say I have been lucky enough with Airbus not to have just one, but to have had several bosses of that same calibre.

Airbus Helicopters: And finally, what aspect of your daily job and your everyday excites you the most?

Dawn Kolbet: The environment and the challenge. Technology increases so exponentially and aviation tends to grow in bursts. There’s a new challenge every day. My job in particular is a bit repetitive…but I don't ever see it that way. I see every day as a new chance to be better at it than I was yesterday. Again, that's the driving factor for why I do everything I do. My dad told me something when I had my oldest child and it has always informed my work ethic and the person that I am. He said, “As a parent, if you remember every day you're trying to build a better adult than you can ever be, your life will never go wrong.” This is definitely something I remind myself on a daily basis.

In contributing to this objective, the Company strives to provide employees with the tools and programmes that will enable them to thrive in their working environment. From transitioning back into work after becoming a parent with “Fly Again” in India, to developing local mentorship opportunities and setting targets for women’s career development opportunities, Airbus has created strong support networks that are key to reducing gender inequalities in the workplace.

In addition to providing these resources for employees, Airbus also extends its outreach to local communities by encouraging them to learn more about the adventures they could embark on within the aviation industry. Thanks to partnerships with organisations that share this goal, such as Elles Bougent in France or the MINT Club in Germany, and its participation in dedicated events around the globe, including the Women in Aviation Conference in the US and the Semaine de l’Industrie in France, Airbus seeks to reach out to more young people thinking about pursuing a career in aviation.

Creating a more inclusive environment is a goal shared by many, including Lisa, Diane and Dawn - three inspiring women who are shaping the landscape of aviation."

Pioneering new uses for carbon capture technology - Airbus,"Wed, 13 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTA5LXBpb25lZXJpbmctbmV3LXVzZXMtZm9yLWNhcmJvbi1jYXB0dXJlLXRlY2hub2xvZ3nSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology was designed by Airbus and the European Space Agency to scrub carbon dioxide from the air aboard the International Space Station (ISS). After its success in space, the technology is now the focus of pioneering efforts to address climate change by using it to convert CO 2 into fertilisers, fuels and carbon negative materials.

The Airbus innovation ecosystem seeks to contribute to a circular economy by identifying which internal innovations have potential applications outside of aviation. After the successful use of DAC on the ISS, as well as on submarines, Airbus Scale, our innovation acceleration unit, began investigating how the technology could be scaled and applied on land to industries that consume or produce CO 2 in their production processes.



Reducing CO 2 emissions is a key part of tackling climate change, especially on industrial levels. Yet despite the overabundant availability of the gas in the atmosphere, CO 2 required for industrial production processes is usually manufactured through polluting combustion methods. The gas is then bottled or transported in tanks, sometimes over hundreds of kilometres, creating even more emissions.

DAC, however, presents the possibility of supplying and capturing CO 2 directly onsite, cutting out suppliers and lowering both costs and carbon emissions for customers. The technology captures CO 2 from the air using a solid amine-based filter, which is then heated to desorb the gas. This results in two exhaust streams: a stream of oxygenated air, and another of pure CO 2 . On the ISS, the oxygenated stream is vented back into the space station for the astronauts to breathe. But by venting the CO 2 where it is needed or capturing it instead, a continual onsite source of CO 2 recycled directly from the atmosphere can be provided.

By switching from combustion-produced CO 2 to captured CO 2 from DAC, farmers can become their own supplier, avoiding complicated transportation logistics, ensuring onsite availability at remote locations, and benefiting from more stable prices and a reduced carbon footprint.

New carbon capture usages

To get DAC ready for its terrestrial uses, Airbus is developing customisable hardware units of various capacities that can be configured to the exact needs of the customer. But what kind of customers are we talking about?

Agriculture

One of the industries that depends on CO 2 is vertical and greenhouse farming. Although vertical farms are already an environmental improvement over traditional farming methods, lowering emissions through reduced land use, plants on all kinds of farms require CO 2 as a fertiliser to boost photosynthesis. By switching from combustion-produced CO 2 to captured CO 2 from DAC, vertical and greenhouse farmers can become their own suppliers. This allows them to avoid complicated transportation logistics, ensure onsite availability at remote locations, and benefit from more stable prices and a reduced carbon footprint.

E-fuels production

Ramping up electrofuels (or “e-fuels”) production is an important part of the energy transition. E-fuels are produced by pulling CO 2 from the atmosphere and synthesising it with hydrogen created using sustainable energy sources, such as wind or solar. When combusted in an engine, the CO 2 released into the atmosphere replaces only what was previously taken out to make the fuel, making it a carbon-neutral solution. DAC therefore has exciting potential to accelerate the emergence and cost-efficient ramp-up of the power-to-liquids (PtL) processes used to make e-fuels. For example, in the aviation industry, sustainable aviation fuels can already reduce CO 2 emissions by 80% throughout their life cycle. DAC can then be used to neutralise the remaining 20%, minimising emissions.

Carbon capture and storage

Another possible industrial use for DAC is using it to meet the growing demand for carbon sequestration. For industries that produce CO 2 and want to prevent it from entering the atmosphere, DAC captures CO 2 and separates it from other molecules in the air before converting the CO 2 into liquid form. The liquid can then be safely stored underground by injecting it into saline formations.

While we are committed to reducing the environmental impact of our own products, services and operations, we also believe that we have a social responsibility to help others do the same. DAC is but one example of our ecosystem-based approach to sustainability, which supports finding new uses for aerospace technology in other industries."

Seville, 13 September 2023 – Airbus Defence and Space has officially handed over in fly-away condition the first of 56 C295 aircraft to the Indian Air Force (IAF) to begin replacing its ageing Avros-748 fleet.

The C295, in transport configuration and with an indigenous electronic warfare suite, will leave Airbus’ production site in Seville, Spain, for Delhi, India, in the next few days, piloted by a joint IAF-Airbus crew.

“It was only two years ago that we signed this contract with India, the largest order in the history of the C295,” said Jean-Brice Dumont, Airbus’ Head of Military Air Systems, in a delivery ceremony held in Seville in the presence of IAF Air Chief Marshal Vivek Ram Chaudhari.

“Today, we are enhancing the capabilities of the Indian Air Force and modernising its transport fleet by delivering the first aircraft on schedule. This is the beginning of an exciting and long-term journey with the Indian Air Force.”

The first 16 C295s of the 56 aircraft on order will be assembled at the San Pablo Sur site in Seville, Spain, with the second aircraft due to be delivered in May 2024 and the next 14 rolled out at a rate of one per month until August 2025.

First C295 ‘Make in India’ in 2026

To boost self-reliance in the defence-manufacturing sector in India, the remaining 40 C295s of the IAF order will be manufactured and assembled - in partnership with Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) - at a Final Assembly Line (FAL) in Vadodara in western India.

The production of components of these aircraft has already started in the Main Constituent Assembly (MCA) facility in Hyderabad, southern India. These parts will be shipped to the Vadovara FAL, which is expected to be operational by November 2024.

The first ‘Make in India’ C295 will roll out of the Vadodara FAL in September 2026 in what will be a milestone for the Indian aerospace industry; the final aircraft expected to be delivered to the IAF by August 2031.

With 283 orders from 41 operators, the C295 is the undisputed leader in its segment and stands out for its versatility. It can carry up to 71 troops or 50 paratroopers, airdrop cargo, be used for medical evacuation and take off and land in short and unpaved runways.

"Airbus, KAI to start Light Armed Helicopter production for Korean Army - Defense News","Fri, 01 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9nbG9iYWwvZXVyb3BlLzIwMjMvMDkvMDEvYWlyYnVzLWthaS10by1zdGFydC1saWdodC1hcm1lZC1oZWxpY29wdGVyLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tZm9yLWtvcmVhbi1hcm15L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Airbus Helicopters and Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) agreed to start serial production of their jointly developed Light Armed Helicopter, Airbus said in a statement on Thursday.

Deliveries to the Republic of Korea Army of an initial 10 helicopters will begin in December 2024, with follow-on orders to continue into the next decade, Airbus spokeswoman Belinda Ng said in an emailed response to questions.

South Korea awarded a contract to KAI for the first batch of attack helicopters in December, with the deal valued at 302 billion won, or $229 million, according to the Korea Herald. Airbus declined to confirm the amount, with Ng saying there had been no official disclosure of the contract value.

The Light Armed Helicopter, based on the Airbus H155 platform, will replace the Korean armed forces’ aging AH-1S Cobra and MD 500 helicopters. KAI will produce the aircraft at its facility in Sacheon, South Korea, with Airbus Helicopters delivering the kits required for mass production. The agreement foresees a next phase of production ramp up, Airbus said.

The companies also agreed to extend their joint Korean Utility Helicopter program to cover a wide range of operational requirements for military and civilian markets. That follows the introduction of new KUH variants, including the Marine Attack Helicopter and the Mine Countermeasure Helicopter.

“KAI is a long-time trusted partner with whom we have successfully developed several helicopter programmes,” Matthieu Louvot, Airbus Helicopters executive vice president for programs, said in a statement. “We are happy to strengthen this strategic partnership with these agreements, where we will secure the delivery of these two highly performing platforms for many years to come.”

Airbus and KAI started their industrial partnership in 2006 with the KUH, followed by the development of the Light Attack Helicopter. The LAH prototype first flew in July 2019 and was qualified in 2022, after testing for combat suitability in all-weather conditions.

The companies also cooperate on the Light Civil Helicopter, like the LAH based on the H155 platform, with first deliveries in October 2022. KAI has sought to maximize common subsystems and parts on the civilian and military versions in a bid to reduce production and operating costs.

The Light Armed Helicopter, with a specified maximum take-off gross weight of 10,846 lbs, is powered by twin turboshaft engines from Safran, and will be equipped with a three-barreled 20mm turret gun, air-to-ground missiles and 70mm rockets.

The goal of the project was to develop a “cutting-edge armed helicopter suitable for the modern battlefield,” according to KAI.

Airbus To Correct A220 Autothrottle Imperfection - Aviation Week,"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9zcGVjaWFsLXRvcGljcy9jcm9zc292ZXItbmFycm93Ym9keS1qZXRzL2FpcmJ1cy1jb3JyZWN0LWEyMjAtYXV0b3Rocm90dGxlLWltcGVyZmVjdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LYON—Airbus is working on improving the A220’s autothrottle design, after several reports of crew errors that could have led to a tail strike or more serious incidents.

The aircraft’s autopilot will be modified, too. In the meantime, procedures are temporarily added in the takeoff phase.

An autothrottle enables the pilot to control power in a smarter way than manually. Typically, the system can adjust fuel flow to attain a specified speed. It therefore helps with pilot workload, fuel consumption and engine life.

On the A220, it happened that the autothrottle unexpectedly disengaged during takeoff. While attempting to reengage the autothrottle during the takeoff roll, some crews inadvertently selected the autopilot.

Inadvertent autopilot engagement may have serious consequences, Airbus says in an article published in its Safety First online magazine. Such an action may result in early rotation that can lead to a tail strike, inability to climb, runway overrun, or even loss of control.

In one event, when the crew mistakenly pressed the autopilot switch, the aircraft started to rotate. At 110 kt, speed was 27 kt below the computed rotation speed. The autopilot nevertheless commanded a pitch-up to reach the flight guidance pitch target. The sequence of events suggests the pilot flying’s immediate inputs were only partly right. The pitch attitude reached 10.7 deg. and the aircraft therefore came 1-2 ft. close to a tail strike, Airbus reckons. After some corrective inputs, the aircraft eventually took off eight kt below the computed speed. The crew continued the flight.

Such a situation can be avoided by design, the airframer’s engineers have determined. To prevent autopilot engagement during the takeoff roll, the Primary Flight Control Computer will be upgraded to inhibit autopilot engagement until six seconds after liftoff. The improvement will be introduced in the second quarter of 2024.

As for the autothrottle, its disconnect logic is being updated. The issues that caused it to disconnect during the takeoff roll will be addressed, Airbus says, falling short of giving a time frame.

Finally, higher priority will be given to takeoff configuration warning messages. In the aforementioned event, the crew could have been warned about the autopilot being wrongly engaged on the ground. That alert, however, was partly hidden by the autothrottle alert.

While system enhancements are being designed, Airbus has issued operational changes to prevent the event from happening again. From now on, the pilots must not attempt to select and engage the autothrottle during the takeoff roll. This will reduce the risk of unintentional selection of the autopilot switch, Airbus says.

Managing an autothrottle disconnect during takeoff is more complex. Depending on the speed, autothrottle takeoff mode and engine rotational speed, the crew should continue or abort takeoff."

Airbus has announced at APEX IFSA Global EXPO that it has selected Panasonic Avionics Corporation (Panasonic Avionics) and Intelsat as Ku-band managed service providers (MSPs) for its Airspace Link HBCplus in-flight connectivity ​solution.

The news firms up a Memorandum of Understanding with both companies that was revealed at Aircraft Interiors Expo in June and further expands Airbus’ range of MSPs – the OEM is already working with SES and Viasat London on its Ka-band HBCplus connectivity offering.

As MSPs, both companies will be able to integrate their multi-orbit connectivity services, which incorporate low-Earth orbit (LEO) and geostationary orbit (GEO) satellite constellations, onto Airbus aircraft using an electronically steered antenna (ESA) with a multi-beam operation.

Airbus also revealed it has selected Safran Passenger Innovations (SPI) as its Ku-band satcom hardware supplier, which will integrate Get-SAT’s low profile ESA as part of its RAVE AeroConnect Ku system. Entry into service is expected to become available next year and enter into service during the first half of 2026. SPI is also providing the hardware for Airbus’ Ka-band HBCplus solutions with an antenna from ThinKom Solutions.

Get SAT CEO, Kfir Benjamin, said, “Together with SPI and Airbus, we’re gearing up to amplify the RAVE AeroConnect IFC offering using our innovative communication terminals, which are specifically designed to cater to airline demands. It’s a matter of pride for us to be a part of such transformative steps in commercial aviation.”

“HBCplus aligns perfectly with our multi-orbit strategy and will seamlessly integrate with our LEO and GEO connectivity solutions,” said John Wade, VP Panasonic Avionics’ In-flight Connectivity Business Unit. “We understand the needs of airlines and OEMs alike. By offering HBCplus we are providing airlines with a greater choice of connectivity services, and ultimately enhancing the passenger experience.”

Dave Bijur, Intelsat’s SVP Commercial Aviation, explained, “Understanding that no airline is like any other, Intelsat has long offered flexibility and choice to its customers, including fit-for-purpose equipment options, and a variety of business models and passenger service offerings. With Airbus, we are offering a new level of sophistication and flexibility that leverages the high throughput of GEO satellites with the low latency delivered by LEO satellites.”

Under the new agreements with Panasonic Avionics and Intelsat, Airbus will manage the HBCplus system installation in both line-fit and retrofit, as well as the related in-service support."

To this end Airbus has selected Safran Passenger Innovations (SPI) as its Ku-band satcom hardware supplier, integrating Get-SAT’s Electronically Steerable Antenna (ESA). Being both *GEO and *LEO compatible, this antenna will unlock simultaneous multi-beam operation for HBCplus Ku-band services for which first entry into service is expected in the course of 2026.

Ku-band MSPs confirmed

Since they were revealed during the 2023 AIX, Intelsat and Panasonic Avionics Corporation have respectively signed contracts and are thus confirmed as launch Managed Service Providers (MSPs) for the Ku-band multi-orbit LEO/GEO HBCplus offering.

Maximilian Ruecker, VP Cabin Procurement Seats, IFE and Electronics says: “As the aircraft OEM, Airbus is looking forward to delivering state-of-the-art built-in aircraft connectivity technology together with Safran Passenger Innovations, integrating Get-SAT’s electronically-steerable antenna to harness multiple satellite constellations. In parallel, our expanding catalogue of selected Managed Service Provider partners – now joined by Intelsat and Panasonic Avionics Corporation – will deliver a fantastic customer experience for airlines’ Airbus Family aircraft through lightning fast internet in-flight.”

With the HBCplus customer base and product offer growing, Airbus builds the foundation of its open ecosystem Airspace Link platform which opens-up the interdependence of hardware with its accompanying software service. Currently, Airbus’ HBCplus’ offer for airlines encompasses Ka-band (*GEO) and *MEO, using SPI’s integrated terminal modem with Thinkom Solutions’ antenna, together with Viasat and SES as the selected MSPs.

"In photos: Airbus Helicopters' fancy flying machine, the H160 - Popular Science","Sat, 23 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHNjaS5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtaDE2MC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A regular helicopter has two pretty visible main components: the top rotor, for giving the flying machine lift, and the tail rotor, to function as an anti-torque system and keep the aircraft from spinning in circles.

A new aircraft from Airbus Helicopters, the H160, takes the tail rotor and tilts it at an angle of 10 degrees. Why do that? It gives the helicopter “free lift,” says Olivier Gensse, the H160’s test pilot. In other words, since the tail rotor is tilted ever so slightly downwards, in addition to carrying out its main anti-torque function, it also directs some thrust downwards. “It’s one percent” of the helicopter’s total lift, Gensse says. (The H160 is not the only helicopter with a canted tail rotor.)

The tail rotor is also enclosed in something called a Fenestron, which gives it an element of safety, because a tail rotor can be a source of serious danger for those on the ground, especially if it’s not enclosed. To understand where the word Fenestron comes from, consider the French word for “window,” which is fenetre, as well as the word fenestrou, which Airbus points out “is Provençal for ‘little window’” and is what the Fenestron used to be called. The H160 also has a design change to its main rotor blades that makes them quieter.

[Related: The US military’s tiniest drone feels like it flew straight out of a sci-fi film]

This June, the H160 received its FAA type certification, although US pilots still need to finish a formal training process allowing them to fly the aircraft for a US carrier, meaning that the H160 may not be operating here until 2024. The helicopter is already flying in places like Europe, Brazil, and Japan; Airbus first showed it off back in 2015.

Take a closer look at the design features of the helicopter, which Gensse refers to as “the first of the new generation” of Airbus helicopters, below.

In this image of the helicopter’s tail section, the 10 degree tilt is clearly visible, as is the aircraft’s biplane-style horizontal stabilizer. All helicopters need a stabilizer in the back to keep them level as they fly forward. Dianne Bond

The H160’s flight deck. The aircraft’s advanced features include a “full automatic takeoff,” Gensse says, adding that a non-pilot could do it with the right direction. It can’t land itself, though, so humans are still required for some tasks. Airbus Helicopters

Notice the way the rotor blades, of which there are five, form a boomerang shape at the tips? Airbus calls these “Blue Edge” blades, and boasts that they are quieter and produce less vibration than regular blades that don’t have that distinctive shape. Airbus Helicopters

The H160 can seat 12 passengers; two pilots sit up front. Besides carrying people, it could also function as an EMS aircraft. Its cruising speed is about 173 mph. Dianne Bond"

In keeping with its purpose of pioneering sustainable aerospace and to support production ramp-up, the company is adopting innovative sail technology to help one of its chartered cargo vessels cross the Atlantic.

The Ville de Bordeaux, chartered from shipowner Louis Dreyfus Armateurs (LDA), regularly ferries A320 Family subassemblies from Europe to Mobile, Alabama, for final assembly.

LDA will equip the vessel with three eSAILs®. This autonomous suction sail system, developed by Barcelona-based firm bound4blue, is expected to deliver fuel and CO2 emissions savings of 560 tons and 1,800 tons respectively, compared to the Ville de Bordeaux’s current performance.* That’s the equivalent of over 700 diesel cars.** The reductions contribute to Airbus’ independently-validatedScope 1 & 2 industrial emissions targets.

Transatlantic Lift

The eSAIL® is a fully autonomous system that builds on the suction sail concept invented in the 1980s by the Jacques Cousteau Foundation. Looking a little like smoke stacks, the lightweight, 22 metre-high structures help push a ship along, partially relieving its main engines.

How do they work? The eSAIL® is a type of Wind-Assisted Propulsion System that uses suction to create lift. In fact the technique creates as much as six to seven times more lift than a conventional sail, with minimal power consumption and mechanical complexity.

The three eSAILs® will be fitted to the Ville de Bordeaux ahead of a six-month sea trial scheduled for the first quarter of 2024. Upon successful completion, they will be put to use on the Saint-Nazaire (France) - Mobile (US) crossing.

Extra capacity to support ramp-up

With operational sustainability in mind, the Ville de Bordeaux is also being fitted with a new elevator and upper cargo deck. The combination means the vessel can carry two additional single-aisle aircraft subassembly sets – wings, fuselage, engine pylons, horizontal and vertical tail planes – between Europe and the US. This brings to six the total number of sets that can be transported on each leg of the journey.

The extra capacity will reduce the number of crossings needed to support Airbus’ commercial aircraft production, which is aggressively ramping up in the United States, as it is elsewhere. Fewer crossings mean lower overall emissions, which are then further reduced by the adoption of bound4blue’s eSAILs®.

Fitting the eSAILs® to the Ville de Bordeaux is just a first step in meeting Airbus’ long-term ambition. Thanks to new, more efficient vessels entering its maritime fleet from 2026, by 2030 Airbus is committed to reducing CO2 emissions from its maritime operations by 50% compared to a 2015 baseline.

Review: Lufthansa First Class Airbus A380 (MUC-BOS) - One Mile at a Time,"Tue, 26 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL3Jldmlld3MvbHVmdGhhbnNhLWZpcnN0LWNsYXNzLWEzODAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For the last segment of the trip to Germany with my parents, we crossed the Atlantic in Lufthansa’s Airbus A380 first class. My goodness, this flight was such a treat.

For one, it was so fun to fly the Lufthansa A380 again, as it only recently reentered service, after having been grounded for years. But what was most special about this flight is that I managed to snag four award seats, so we had half of the cabin to ourselves. Add in an exceptionally friendly crew, and this was one of my best Lufthansa flights yet.

While Lufthansa’s first class isn’t at all cutting edge, it’s a comfortable product, flying the A380 is always a treat, and it’s also the best value for crossing the Atlantic in first class using miles. Let’s get into the review.

How I booked my Lufthansa first class ticket

I booked myself the following itinerary in first class for 100,000 Air Canada Aeroplan points plus $124.90 in taxes and fees:

8/19 LH2367 Zurich to Munich departing 9:20AM arriving 10:10AM

8/19 LH424 Munich to Boston departing 3:35PM arriving 5:50PM

Then I booked my mom and her partner, as well as my dad, the following itinerary for 100,000 Air Canada Aeroplan points plus $191.25 in taxes and fees per person:

8/19 LH104 Frankfurt to Munich departing 12:15PM arriving 1:10PM

8/19 LH424 Munich to Boston departing 3:35PM arriving 5:50PM

For those wondering, I had booked all four first class seats about four days before departure. I saw that seven of the eight first class seats were still for sale a week out, so knew the odds of first class award space opening up was very good. See my guide to redeeming miles for Lufthansa first class.

Lufthansa first class lounge & boarding

I met up with my family at Munich Airport — the Lufthansa First Class Lounge Munich is very nice, and we had a great stay there. While the airline is best known for the Lufthansa First Class Terminal Frankfurt, in many ways I actually prefer the Munich location.

Lufthansa’s inconsistent ground service when traveling in first class always seems like a bit of a missed opportunity. For example, when I arrived in business class from Zurich, I was picked up in this pretty epic Porsche.

Lufthansa first class Porsche transfer

Meanwhile if you depart from a gate in the same concourse as the lounge, you’re on your own. That’s not an issue in terms of being able to walk to the gate, but there’s the typical line where you’re asked security questions for US-bound flights, and no priority is given to first class passengers over business class passengers. So we had to wait about 10-15 minutes to clear that check.

It’s not a huge deal at all, but it just seems like an area where Lufthansa could make the first class ground service a bit more seamless, as a way of further differentiating it.

Anyway, at the far end of the concourse there were three Airbus A380s parked. While there was an A380 in the new livery…

Lufthansa Airbus A380 Munich Airport

…we were flying on an Airbus A380 in the old livery. Specifically, we were on D-AIMM, a roughly eight year old jet that spent the past few years in storage.

Lufthansa Airbus A380 Munich Airport

We were departing from gate L38, with boarding scheduled for 3:05PM, 30 minutes before departure. Sure enough, that’s exactly when boarding started, with first class being invited to board first.

Lufthansa A380 first class cabin & seats

There’s nothing quite like boarding the upper deck of the A380, where the jet bridge slopes up, rather than down. At the forward upper deck door we were greeted by the lovely crew, and pointed left into first class.

Lufthansa’s Airbus A380 first class cabin consists of a total of eight seats, spread across two rows, in a 1-2-1 configuration. This is almost exactly the same layout you’ll find in Lufthansa’s A340-600 first class. It’s also the same number of seats you’ll find in Lufthansa’s 747-8 first class, except the layout is different, given that the cabin is in the nose of the plane.

Make no mistake, this is about as outdated as first class hard products get. At the same time, there’s a certain charm to the cabin, from the roses at each seat, to some of the details of the cabin finishes.

I had booked us in the second row of the cabin, so we had the entire second row to ourselves. There were two other people in first class, in the window seats in row one.

The center seats are great if you’re traveling with someone, since you can really enjoy the flight together.

Meanwhile the window seats are best for solo travelers, since you get both a window and an aisle, and just generally have more privacy.

I was seated in 2A, the window seat on the left side in the second row.

Lufthansa’s first class seat does have some handy features. For example, there’s a sliding ottoman that can also double as a buddy seat. This can be opened, to reveal a pretty substantial storage compartment.

The seat also has a couple of storage compartments along the windows. They’re not very big, but perfect for storing a phone, a pair of glasses, or a passport (though don’t forget them at the end of the flight). One of these compartments also has the headphones, which can’t be detached from the cord.

Underneath the left armrest are the power outlets, including a USB-A and two AC power outlets. This setup is quite frustrating, since it’s common for items to just fall out of the AC power outlet, given the angle.

A huge tray table also extends from this side of the seat. It takes quite a bit of strength to take it out or store it again, though it then slides in both directions pretty easily.

The entertainment controller is located at the left armrest, and is easy to use.

Then at the right armrest is the seat controls,

The seat controls can also be used to raise the privacy partition at the seat, which is much needed in this product, given that it otherwise lacks privacy.

While the overhead console on the A380 has reading lights, unfortunately there are no individual air nozzles.

While I’m not sure it makes up for it, in first class there are some pretty elegant shades, whereby you can raise or lower the window shades with the push of a button.

To give the first class cabin a more spacious feel, you’ll notice that there are no overhead bins in the cabin. Instead, there are some storage lockers at the very back of the cabin, which are huge. There’s one for each seat, and it’ll easily fit your carry-on, personal item, and any clothes you want to hang up during the flight.

I also love the curtain that’s used between the cabin and the galley. Rather than being your typical flimsy curtain, it’s quite firm and also magnetic, so that it fully closes between the cabin and galley. This helps with managing noise and light.

Lufthansa first class amenities

As soon as we settled in, the two lovely first class flight attendants introduced themselves to us, and offered us pre-departure drinks. We decided to have some rose champagne, and the absolutely fabulous Laurent-Perrier 2007 Grande Cuve Rose Alexandra was on offer. This was served with some macadamia nuts. Yum.

We were then offered the typical selection of first class amenities.

This included an amenity kit containing socks, eyeshades, a dental kit, earplugs, a comb, a shoe horn, and skincare products from Augustinus Bader.

We were also offered slippers — Lufthansa’s first class slippers are my absolute favorite, as they’re thick and well padded.

We were also offered van Laack pajamas, with solid dark blue pants and a striped top.

There was also a selection of basic bedding, including a pillow and a blanket. This is intended for lounging, as there’s more substantial bedding when it’s time to sleep.

There were also a pair of Bose headphones each seat. They’re wired into the storage compartment, so that they can’t be removed. These are excellent headphones, as it seems like this is an area where a lot of airlines get cheap.

Toward the end of the boarding process, the purser came through the cabin to offer each first class passenger the menu and wine list, and also vouchers for free Wi-Fi.

Lufthansa A380 first class entertainment & Wi-Fi

While Lufthansa’s first class seats aren’t cutting edge, the area where the product really lags is with inflight entertainment. Lufthansa’s entertainment monitors are both small and incredibly low definition. It’s like stepping back in time 20 years.

Lufthansa A380 first class entertainment system

There’s a selection of movies, TV, shows, audio, and games. The selection is reasonably extensive, with a few hundred movies and TV shows, but the quality of the monitors is really where this disappoints.

Personally I’m not a huge fan of watching movies and TV shows, so my go-to entertainment is the map feature, which I enjoyed keeping an eye on throughout the flight.

Lufthansa A380 first class entertainment system

While Lufthansa doesn’t have a great entertainment system, the airline does have Wi-Fi, which is free for first class passengers, with no data caps. To me that largely makes up for the otherwise lackluster entertainment.

Lufthansa A380 Wi-Fi system

If you don’t have free Wi-Fi, you can expect the cost on Lufthansa’s A380s to be as follows:

For €9 you could purchase a messaging pass

For €19 you could purchase a two hour premium pass

For €29 you could purchase a full flight premium pass

That’s definitely on the pricey side, but not awful when you consider the lack of data caps.

With the voucher code I had been given during boarding, I could log into the free Wi-Fi, under the “Redeem Voucher” section.

Lufthansa A380 departure from Munich

While boarding had started on time, we were a bit delayed on departure. Around 20 minutes after boarding, the captain came to the upper deck to personally greet each first class passenger. Another OMAAT reader mentioned a similar experience, so I suspect he does this on almost every flight. He was a super nice guy, and it was fun to ask him about his thoughts on the A380, etc.

He told us that our flight time would be 7hr30min, though warned us that we’d be a bit late departing, as we were waiting on some connecting passengers. However, since our flight time was a bit shorter than normal, he still anticipated a (nearly) on-time arrival.

Our delay ended up dragging on for quite some time. At 4PM it was announced that bags had been loaded for some passengers who didn’t show up, so those needed to be offloaded. That ended up taking around 30 minutes.

Suffice it to say that we didn’t mind the delay one bit, as we were having fun, and the crew kept our champagne topped off.

Finally at 4:30PM we began our pushback, at which point the safety video was screened. Lufthansa’s A380s have a tail camera, which is a feature that I love, so it was a real treat to watch that throughout our departure. At 4:35PM we began our taxi, and 10 minutes later we were at the departure runway.

We were airborne at 4:45PM. Taking off in an A380 is just such a different experience than on any other plane, since you barely feel the movement.

We had a smooth climb out, and the seatbelt sign was turned off about 10 minutes after takeoff.

Once airborne, the crew came through the cabin to take drink and meal orders. You can find the first class menu below.

Once orders were taken, warm towels were distributed on little plates (though it seems that it’s no longer presented with a rose petal).

The first drink was served about 25 minutes after takeoff. We decided to switch to the white champagne, which was Laurent-Perrier Grand Siecle. It’s rare that you get both an excellent white and rose champagne, so Lufthansa gets high marks for champagne at the moment (though keep in mind the selection is constantly rotating). And yes, I couldn’t help but photograph my champagne with the ducks I managed to pick up this trip.

The tray table was then set about 40 minutes after takeoff. We were offered a selection of bread, plus the amuse bouche, which was duck breast with quinoa.

Lufthansa first class lunch — amuse bouche

About 60 minutes after takeoff, a trolley was rolled down the aisle with a selection of three appetizers, salad, soup, and caviar. You can choose any or all of those, and there’s even a tray display so that you can easily enjoy all three appetizers at once.

I ordered the three appetizers and caviar. The appetizers included:

Corn-fed poularde with herbs on green asparagus salad, tomato gel, and yuzu mayonnaise

Salmon trout tataki style with marinated kohlrabi, celery, and cashew nuts

Marinated carrot rolls with lemon gel, dried acai berries, thickened yogurt, and bread croutons

We were offered second helpings of caviar, which my mom was excited about.

Service was performed at a perfectly customized and leisurely pace, which we were especially appreciative of on a daytime flight. There were four different main course options. I decided to order the pecorino ravioli with tomato sauce, fried basil, grated cheese, and pine nuts. Real talk — this was one of the best pasta dishes I’ve had on a plane.

My dad decided to order the turbot filet accompanied by roasted cauliflower florets on mashed cauliflower and fish velouté with yuzu.

Meanwhile my mom’s partner ordered the herb crusted beef filet steak with green asparagus and wild mushrooms.

For dessert, I decided to have the tarte tatin with vanilla ice cream, which was scrumptious.

My dad had a cheese plate, which he enjoyed as well.

At the conclusion of the meal, the crew came around with a box of chocolates, and there was even a menu describing each option.

This was one of the better meals I’ve had in Lufthansa first class. Truth be told, Lufthansa’s first class catering isn’t particularly remarkable. Usually I just have caviar and some appetizers, and then skip the main. However, since we were all enjoying the flight, I figured I might as well indulge a bit.

Lufthansa A380 first class lavatories

One of the unique features of the Lufthansa Airbus A380 is its bathroom setup. The lavatories are located at the front of the upper deck, on each side of the staircase.

Lufthansa A380 staircase

Speaking of the staircase, it’s interesting how Lufthansa sets up a “gate” here during the flight. This probably makes sense, as I could picture someone not paying attention and then falling, which could lead to serious injury.

Lufthansa A380 staircase

Lufthansa’s two A380 first class lavatories are identical. While not to the level of the Emirates A380 shower suite, this is still a very spacious setup. The bathroom has a long bench that you can sit on, a toilet, and even a urinal, which you won’t otherwise find on any other airline.

The lavatory is also stocked with a variety of amenities, ranging from facial spray, to refreshing towels, to combs, to shaving kits.

The lavatory also has proper towels, rather than just paper towels.

Lufthansa A380 first class bed

At the conclusion of the meal, we asked the crew to make all of our beds, which was promptly taken care of. For all of the shortcoming of Lufthansa’s first class hard product, I find the beds to be extremely comfortable, especially thanks to the great mattress pad and duvet.

I ended up going to sleep with just under 4hr30min remaining to Boston…

…and woke up with just over two hours remaining to Boston.

Lufthansa first class pre-arrival snack

After waking up, I needed some caffeine, so I asked the crew for a cappuccino, which was promptly served, along with a chocolate.

Lufthansa has a flexible pre-arrival snack concept in first class, so you can order this whenever you’d like. We ended up having our pre-landing snack around 90 minutes before landing. You can find the menu below.

Lufthansa first class menu

I decided to order the veggie burger, which was served with guacamole, barbecue sauce, tomato, red onions, kale, and potato chips. This dish was extremely well executed, since it’s clear all the ingredients were plated onboard prior to being served. This was in a totally different league than United’s underwhelming first class cheeseburger.

My mom decided to have the gourmet salad with mixed greens, pineapple, papaya, pecan nuts, and king prawns, with a yogurt lime dressing. She enjoyed this, and it was a nice, light option.

At the conclusion of the meal, I ordered a cup of drip coffee. I feel like almost nothing about the Lufthansa first class experience has changed in so long… except these mugs! They’re new (as far as I know), and a huge improvement, since they can hold a decent amount of coffee without spilling.

Lufthansa first class service

I find that service in Lufthansa first class can range from fine to exceptional. The crews are always professional and respectful, the question is just how engaging, attentive, and friendly they are. The two ladies working first class on this flight were total superstars, and I’m so grateful for how nice they made this flight for us.

On some level, I imagine they were feeding off of our energy. We were all having fun together and were obviously excited to all be traveling together, and the crew wanted to make that special for us. So huge shoutout to this exceptional crew, and I hope I get to fly with them again (though I can’t imagine the next flight will be as fun as this one).

We had a blast on this flight!

Lufthansa A380 arrival in Boston

At 5:25PM Boston time, the first officer announced that we’d be landing in about 40 minutes, and would be starting our descent soon. At this point I changed back into my regular clothes and stowed my bags, and watched the tail camera for the entire descent.

The seatbelt sign was turned on about 15 minutes before landing.

Despite some pretty cloudy and windy conditions, the pilots executed a perfectly smooth touchdown in Boston at 6:05PM.

Due to construction at Boston Logan Airport, we had a considerable delay getting to the gate. The taxiways were basically like a parking lot. 10 minutes after landing, the captain came on the PA to explain that roughly 10 airplanes would have to get out of our way before we could get to the gate, and it would likely be another 20 minutes or so.

Finally at 6:35PM we arrived at our gate, about 45 minutes behind schedule.

From there we headed to the Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor for the night. I was so sad to say goodbye to my family, and the next morning we took our respective flights back to Florida. Prior to my flight, I had the chance to check out the Chase Sapphire Lounge Boston and American Admirals Club Boston.

Bottom line

I’m so happy to see Lufthansa’s Airbus A380s back in service. Not only does this represent an increase in Lufthansa’s first class footprint, but the A380 is a pleasure to fly, thanks to the smooth ride, the tail camera, and the urinals (or something).

This was an excellent Lufthansa first class flight, with very friendly service, great champagne, and solid food. But ultimately what made this experience so special was being able to share it with my family. Snagging four first class award seats on one flight is one of those “pinch me” moments, and it’s a memory I’ll cherish for years to come.

These findings clearly show that Airbus is good for jobs, good for growth, and good for the UK.



I am proud of the contribution our 11,500 UK employees make to the UK economy - a multi billion pound effort from satellites to civil aerospace that helps connect people all over the world. Our deep roots in the UK supply chain and investment across the four nations create genuine regional and local growth - ensuring Airbus’ impact is felt at every level.

All.Space was previously known as Isotropic Systems. The company was rebranded a year ago. Emerson’s appointment was announced Sept. 11.

Emerson joins All.Space as the company prepares to start production of a new terminal — known as fifth-generation smart terminal — by the fourth quarter of 2023.

The company previously forecast that the new terminal, designed to link cellular and satellite networks, would start production in late 2022.

All.Space to date has raised more than $116 million. Emerson is a partner at Washington, D.C.-based AE Industrial Partners, one of the investors in All.Space.

“All.Space is pioneering the next generation of satellite communications with our inventive smart terminal,” Emerson said in a news release. “Our technology will transform how individuals and organizations access and use satellite and cellular communications, enabling our customers to harness the power of every major network through one device.”

The smart terminal promises “3G, 4G, and 5G cellular multi-network integration plug-and-play options,” said John Finney, founder and CEO of All.Space.

He said the new terminal is undergoing performance and reliability tests. “Our initial market entry is dedicated to serving the needs of NATO and Five Eyes defense markets,” Finney said. The Five Eyes is an intelligence alliance that includes Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States."

Air France-KLM Orders $16 Billion Worth of Long-Range Airbus Planes - Skift Travel News,"Mon, 25 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tL2Jsb2cvYWlyLWZyYW5jZS1rbG0tb3JkZXJzLTE2LWJpbGxpb24td29ydGgtb2YtbG9uZy1yYW5nZS1haXJidXMtcGxhbmVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air France-KLM will add up to 90 new long-range Airbus A350 aircraft to its fleet in the coming years, under an order unveiled Monday.

The aircraft, which include 50 firm A350-900s and -1000s plus 40 purchase rights, are worth roughly $16.2 billion, based on Cirium Ascend’s full-life base values. Deliveries will begin in 2026 and run through at least 2030.

The deal still requires approval of the Air France-KLM board.

“It is the perfect fit for the network needs of the group and boasts outstanding performances: it is a quieter, more fuel efficient and more cost-effective aircraft compared to previous generations,” Air France-KLM CEO Ben Smith said in a statement.

Air France-KLM has ordered up to 90 more Airbus A350s. (Airbus)

Air France-KLM was reportedly considering both the Airbus A350 as well as the Boeing 777X and 787 for the order. The planes will replace older Airbus A330s and Boeing 777s in the group’s fleet.

The Air Current reported earlier in September that, due to range considerations owing to the closure of Russian airspace to European airlines for flights to Asia, Air France-KLM was leaning towards the A350 for the order.

The deal is the latest win for Airbus from Air France-KLM. In December 2021, the group ordered at least 100 A320neo family aircraft for its KLM and Transavia brands. The planes will replace older Boeing 737s at both airlines. And earlier that year Air France-KLM was a launch customer for the new A350 freighter.

Air France already operates 22 A350-900s and has firm orders for 19 more aircraft. With the latest deal, Air France-KLM will eventually operate at least 99 A350s, which will make it one of the largest operators of the plane globally."
"Fake components went into 68 jet engines, including ones on Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 planes, says lawsuit - Fortune","Fri, 08 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wOS8wOC9mYWtlLWNvbXBvbmVudHMtNjgtamV0LWVuZ2luZXMtYm9laW5nLTczNy1haXJidXMtYTMyMC1wbGFuZXMtbGF3c3VpdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CFM International Inc. says 68 jet engines were fitted with spare parts backed by fraudulent documentation from a little-known UK-based supplier, a sign that fake components may have been installed on certain older-model aircraft.

The finding was included in a lawsuit filed by the joint venture of General Electric Co. and Safran SA in the UK against closely held AOG Technics Ltd, according to a statement from CFM. The suit seeks an injunction to force AOG to provide more information to aid the aviation industry’s search for suspect components.

“Safety is our first priority, and we are taking aggressive legal action against AOG Technics to accelerate the industry’s ability to identify parts sold by this third-party with falsified documentation,” a CFM spokesman said in a statement.

Representatives for AOG could not be reached for immediate comment.

The development provides the first hint at how many older-generation Airbus SE A320 and Boeing Co. 737 aircraft may have been fitted with spare parts that London-based AOG allegedly sold with falsified airworthiness records. It’s unclear whether additional engines may have used unauthorized replacement parts.

Aviation regulators in Europe determined AOG supplied parts for the repair of CFM56 engines, the world’s best-selling turbine, with falsified documentation, Bloomberg News reported last week.

The proliferation of undocumented parts has sent shock waves through an industry where every component requires verification to ensure aircraft safety. Without such assurance, it’s impossible to know how durable uncertified parts will be under stress.

Regulators, airlines and other industry players have since been scouring their records to hunt down the suspect components sold by AOG, the obscure supplier at the center of the crisis. AOG has no direct affiliation with CFM or its partners.

To date, CFM and GE Aerospace have found 78 documents they say are falsified and which cover 52 CFM56 engine part numbers, along with two faked records for CF6 components.

No incidents linked to the suspect parts have been identified, the companies have said.

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency earlier this week determined that the components backed by forged documentation included turbine blades, a critical component of an aircraft’s propulsion system.

“We remain fully engaged with aviation regulatory authorities to support their investigations into AOG Technics, and we continue to work with our customers to assess the authenticity of documentation for parts they acquired directly or indirectly from AOG Technics,” the CFM spokesman said.

Now, carriers operating certain Airbus and Boeing planes are racing to fix a new problem: fake engine parts. According to a new report from Bloomberg, airlines flying older-generation Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 planes might have been duped into fitting their engines with counterfeit parts. Now they’re all rushing to find the fake parts and replace them before anything bad happens, Owen Bellwood reports for Jalopnik. Continue reading original article.

The Military & Aerospace Electronics take:

8 September 2023 - Bloomberg and Jalopnik report that counterfeit parts were for the CFM56 jet engine, which powers older generation Boeing an Airbus aircraft. The counterfeits were sold with forged certification, according to the the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EUASA). The safety agency said the parts were supplied by AOG Technics in London. The company, Bloomberg reports, has not ""provide[ed] detail on the actual origin of the questionable parts.”

“The documentation of parts is a very critical issue,” said Klaus Mueller, a senior adviser at AeroDynamic Advisory and a former senior executive at MTU Aero Engines AG and Deutsche Lufthansa AG’s maintenance arm. “The industry is taking this topic very, very seriously.”

This will be an ""evolutionary order,"" the company said, giving it flexibility to allocate aircraft within its portfolio of airlines based on market dynamics and local regulatory conditions.

The company's board met earlier Monday to approve the purchase of Airbus' most advanced airliner, which will help meet sustainability targets, including a 30% decline in carbon emissions. Air France-KLM has a previous order for 41 Airbus A350-900s for Air France, of which 22 have been delivered.

Air France-KLM had sought between 30 to 50 wide-body jets from Airbus or Boeing to replace its Airbus A330 models that average 20 years, alongside a batch of two-decade-old Boeing 777s, Bloomberg News reported on Sept. 14.

Boeing announced a separate deal earlier on Monday with Air Canada, which agreed to buy 18 787-10 Dreamliner models. The aircraft will be used to replace older, less efficient wide-body aircraft currently in the Air Canada fleet and will begin shipping in the fourth quarter of 2025.

Airlines across the world are snapping up wide-body jets as long-haul travel rebounds and stretches out waiting lists for newer, more fuel-efficient jets. The Franco-Dutch carrier has already retired its fleet of Boeing 747s and A380s and has added more modern 787 Dreamliners and Airbus' A350 aircraft.

Earlier this month, Air France-KLM and Airbus announced plans for a proposed maintenance joint venture for the Airbus A350 aircraft, giving Airbus some leverage in its talks with the Franco-Dutch group. Air France-KLM has historically maintained a relatively split fleet between the two major manufacturers.

A large part of Air France-KLM's evaluation process included the new reality of having to circumnavigate Russian airspace following the invasion of Ukraine. That detour can add several hours to a flight and changes the requirements for the aircraft, Air France-KLM Chief Executive Officer Ben Smith said in a June interview."
Airbus 'will be ready' to develop hydrogen-powered aircraft by 2035 goal: CEO - Flightglobal,"Thu, 14 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mbGlnaHRnbG9iYWwuY29tL2FpcmZyYW1lcnMvYWlyYnVzLXdpbGwtYmUtcmVhZHktdG8tZGV2ZWxvcC1oeWRyb2dlbi1wb3dlcmVkLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWJ5LTIwMzUtZ29hbC1jZW8vMTU0OTYyLmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus executives are increasingly optimistic the company can bring a hydrogen-powered aircraft to market in the mid-2030s and plan within several years to settle on the best propulsion architecture for such an aircraft.

“The bottlenecks are no longer in the technology of the plane,” Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury said on 12 September during an aerospace event in Washington DC. “We strongly believe that we will be ready by 2035 with a hydrogen plane. The technology will be ready.”

Airbus in 2020 revealed three hydrogen-powered aircraft concepts as part of its ZEROe programme, and said it aimed to bring one to market by 2035.

The European manufacturer is among several industry players that think hydrogen-powered aircraft could be viable in the coming years. Hydrogen emits only water when burned or used to produce electricity, giving it promise as a means by which the aviation industry can cut carbon emissions. Due to notable challenges, however, other players like Boeing doubt such designs will be ready in the near term.

Airbus Americas CEO Jeffrey Knittel says several years of evaluation has left Airbus more sure of the technology.

“We’re going to make a decision on whether it’s a fuel cell or a [direct-burn propulsion system]” in 2026 or 2027, Knittel says. “We will make a decision on production at that point in time.”

Executives stress that, optimism aside, Airbus has not committed to developing a hydrogen-powered passenger airliner, saying the decision depends on factors partly or largely outside the company’s control.

Those include unclear regulatory and certification standards, the need for hydrogen transportation and storage infrastructure, and the availability – at the “right price” – of green hydrogen produced using renewable electricity: “That’s going to be where the challenge lies,” Faury says.

Knittel says any initial hydrogen-powered aircraft would likely be on the “smaller” side, and that “long range” is among the toughest “challenges” associated with hydrogen propulsion.

Hydrogen has worse volumetric energy density than jet fuel, with four times the volume per energy unit. That means a hydrogen aircraft would need to carry more fuel than a conventionally powered aircraft to achieve the same range.

The two types of hydrogen-propulsion architectures under study by Airbus include a fuel cell system, which uses hydrogen to create electricity, and engines that directly burn hydrogen.

Airbus is developing the hydrogen-powered concepts at the same time it is working on development of a “relatively conventional” jet to replace the A320neo family of aircraft, the company’s chief commercial officer Christian Scherer said in June.

Airbus’s three ZEROe concepts include a 2,000nm (3,704km)-range blended-wing-body aircraft with seating for up to 200 passengers, a conventional-looking 200-passenger narrowbody aircraft with hydrogen-burning gas turbines and 2,000nm range, and a 100-passenger, 1,000nm-range turboprop, potentially powered by fuel cells."
Airbus Helicopters Unveils PioneerLab Sustainability Platform at Aviation Conference - FLYING,"Tue, 26 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZseWluZ21hZy5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLXVudmVpbHMtcGlvbmVlcmxhYi1zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS1wbGF0Zm9ybS1hdC1hdmlhdGlvbi1jb25mZXJlbmNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters unveiled the PioneerLab, a twin-engine technology demonstrator, during the German National Aviation Conference in Hamburg.

The company said the purpose of the demonstrator, which is based on its H145 helicopter platform, is to test technologies that reduce helicopter emissions and make use of bio-based materials—both in its fuel as well as structural components.

“With PioneerLab, we continue our ambitious strategy to test and mature new technologies on board our helicopter demonstrators,” said Tomasz Krysinski, head of research and innovation programs at Airbus Helicopters. “PioneerLab, which is based in Germany at our Donauwörth site, will be our platform to test technologies specifically dedicated to twin-engine helicopters.”

One of the company’s goals with the PioneerLab is to reduce fuel consumption by as much as 30 percent compared with a conventional H145. The expected reduction reflects the demonstrator’s hybrid-electric propulsion system and a number of aerodynamic improvements.

The company also plans to use the demonstrator to flight-test structural parts that are made from bio-based and recycled materials to reduce the aircraft’s environmental footprint. Airbus Helicopters said it intends to produce the new parts using processes that consume less material and energy while improving recyclability.

The test program will also include integration of the latest digital light control technologies aimed at increasing autonomy and safety during takeoff, landing, and other critical phases of flight.

The PioneerLab’s flight test program has begun at the manufacturer’s largest German site in Donauwörth. A rotor strike alerting system was the first item aboard the demonstrator. The next testing phase will include an automated takeoff and landing system."
Airbus Names Scherer As Commercial Aircraft CEO - Aviation Week,"Tue, 26 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcmNyYWZ0LXByb3B1bHNpb24vYWlyYnVzLW5hbWVzLXNjaGVyZXItY29tbWVyY2lhbC1haXJjcmFmdC1jZW_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is carving out its commercial aircraft business as a separate entity and has named sales chief Christian Scherer as the new unit’s CEO.

The move reverses a decision under previous Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders who had been heading both the group and the commercial aircraft division until 2019. Enders’ successor Guillaume Faury has since held both positions since he took over in April 2019.

Airbus said Sept. 26 that the split will allow Faury to focus more on overall strategy, the transformation to more sustainable flying, and dedicate more of his time to the other Airbus units.

Scherer, 61, is planned to take up his new position as CEO of Airbus Commercial Aircraft on Jan. 1, 2024. The move is a complex exercise. Airbus will not only have to nominate a management team to lead the subsidiary—Scherer will also have to propose what group units will be integrated into the commercial aircraft division.

Likewise, it is still unclear what the decision means for the various Airbus production facilities, many of which are exclusively dedicated to building commercial aircraft. The sites are currently organized under the umbrellas of the Airbus Group country organizations in France, Germany, and the UK. Another matter is which Airbus Commercial executives in addition to Scherer will be members of the group executive committee in the future.

Airbus said these issues need to be tackled over the next few months. The company was the only major OEM to have integrated the commercial aircraft business within the group function. Airbus will also have to decide who will replace Scherer as head of sales.

Scherer’s Airbus career spans decades. Having started as an intern in the contracts department in the early 1980s, he joined Airbus in 1984 as commercial contracts manager. Between 1987 and 1994, Scherer was Vice President Contracts for Airbus North America before returning to Toulouse to take over as Vice President Leasing Markets. From 2003, he was the deputy of sales chief John Leahy.

In the early 2010s, Scherer was one of the driving forces behind the launch of the A320neo family, which has since turned into the manufacturer’s most successful aircraft program.

Scherer later led sales of Airbus Defense—known as Cassidian at the time—beginning in 2012, and then in November 2016 became CEO of turboprop joint venture ATR. When Leahy retired, Airbus initially picked former Rolls-Royce executive Eric Schultz as his successor, but then reversed the decision only a year later, in September 2018, to promote Scherer to his current position of Chief Commercial Officer.

Through his decades in sales, Scherer has built a huge network of industry contacts and gained a reputation for being close to customers. However, his new position will require a different skill set and force him to become much more involved in managing the industrial side of the business, which has faced massive challenges for some years.

Airbus has embarked on a slow modernization of its production sites but is weighing those efforts against ambitious plans to boost production. A320neo family rates are to increase to 75 units per month by 2026 from 40-50 today while the A220 is to move to 14 from five and the A350 from five aircraft to nine per month by the end of 2025.

Airbus also has to manage its relationship with suppliers. Hold-ups on their part have led to frequent delivery delays ever since the industry began to emerge from the pandemic.

Scherer is also facing major strategy decisions. Industry sources expect Airbus to launch a stretched version of the A220 within the next two years, with entry-into-service before the end of the decade. At roughly 180 seats, the aircraft would compete with the 737-8 and the A320neo. Given the continuing quality and durability issues of the PW1100G, Airbus is expected to choose CFM International as a second engine manufacturer for the new A220 program in addition to Pratt & Whitney. CFM partners GE and Safran could use the A220 as an early application for some technologies they are developing for the RISE program to be introduced for larger aircraft by 2035 or later.

Faury has also indicated that Airbus is looking at launching an A320neo successor for the middle of the 2030s, a project that would have to be formally started still within Scherer’s term should Airbus want to stick to that schedule."
Airbus Trialing New Architecture For H135 Light Helicopter - Aviation Week,"Fri, 22 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1hdmlhdGlvbi9haXJjcmFmdC1wcm9wdWxzaW9uL2FpcmJ1cy10cmlhbGluZy1uZXctYXJjaGl0ZWN0dXJlLWgxMzUtbGlnaHQtaGVsaWNvcHRlctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters says it is testing a new architecture for its H135 twin-engine light helicopter after images emerged of one of the company’s aircraft in a new configuration.

Pictures taken from outside the company’s facility in Donauworth, Germany, and first published by the helicopter website Helihub on Sept. 22 show the aircraft in a similar configuration to the company’s Bluecopter environmental technology demonstrator. That aircraft was first flown in 2015.

The aircraft, registered D-HEEY, features a five-blade main rotor and replaces the H135’s four-blade configuration. It has a broader tail boom and a more swept vertical stabilizer, with a T-tail horizontal stabilizer sitting above the fenestron anti-torque system.

The latter replaces the horizontal stabilizer set into the tail boom forward of the fenestron. The aircraft’s fuselage has also been updated with a more streamlined nose, fewer windows and larger clamshell doors at the rear.

Pictured unpainted, the aircraft also appears to make greater use of composite materials, which may suggest an effort to remove weight and increase payload capacity.

In an emailed response, an Airbus spokesman said the company was “testing new architectural elements. These include the five-bladed rotor that we successfully introduced on our H145 in 2019.”

It is unclear at this point whether the new configuration points to another environmental development aircraft or a new version of the 3-metric-ton H135 making use of the Bluecopter technology approach.

H135 sales have in recent years begun to lag that of the larger H145 since it was upgraded with the five-blade main rotor and fenestron in 2019.

Around 1,400 H135s are in service around the world in more than 60 countries. The type is popular with law enforcement, emergency medical service operators and military customers for flight training missions.

The Bluecopter project was aimed at making helicopters more socially acceptable by reducing noise and fuel consumption. Self-funded by Airbus, it was also supported by Germany’s LuFo-IV research program and the European Clean Sky initiative.

Having completed her studies at Lycée Airbus, then an apprenticeship at Airbus Helicopters in Marignane in partnership with the Aeronautics Training Centre of Istres, Lisa is now contributing to this narrative at Airbus Helicopters, where she works as a technician as part of the Centre of Excellence Rotors & Transmissions team.

Airbus Helicopters: Can you tell us about your current role and where you are based?

lisa Cros: I work at Airbus Helicopters as a machining technician - a role that involves using machining processes with a flat or cylindrical surface to create individual parts containing specific materials or particular metallurgic characteristics - in my case, this consists of manufacturing the components that transmit power from the engine to the blades of the helicopter. The process is not complete however, until the machining technician has checked the dimensions of the machined part and ensured there aren’t any imperfections.

Airbus Helicopters: What inspired you to join the aerospace industry?

lisa Cros: Very young, I knew that I wanted to pursue a manual profession in mechanics and I decided to take a path in the field of aeronautics. In the aerospace industry, jobs are much more interesting because they are more complex than other sectors. What also pushed me into this industry is the satisfaction of participating in the manufacturing of an aircraft and knowing that it is partly thanks to me that it can fly.

Airbus Helicopters: What has been your most memorable adventure in the industry?

lisa Cros: It was probably when I became independent at my first workstation, which was the result of all my schooling and learning. I was grateful to see that my efforts had paid off.

Airbus Helicopters: What valuable advice have you been given? Are there any tips or recommendations you would like to share with young girls who aspire to pursue a career in aviation or science?

lisa Cros: Young girls who want to pursue a career in aviation or science should not doubt their choice out of fear of experiencing prejudice in sectors considered to be male-dominated. Soon, this will no longer be how these sectors are seen- there are more and more women in these fields and being a woman should in no way be a hindrance. No matter what position we hold, we all do the same work, and we are all work colleagues.

Airbus Helicopters: Are you involved in any organizations or initiatives to support girls and women in aviation? If so, why was it important for you to participate in such initiatives?

lisa Cros: During my schooling at Lycée Airbus (high school), I was part of the “Elles du Futur”. This initiative aims to introduce middle school girls to careers in aeronautics. In my opinion, if there are so few women in aerospace professions, it is only due to lack of awareness. They are not given enough opportunities to learn about the aeronautical industry.

Airbus Helicopters: In difficult times, what helps you stay focussed on your goal?

lisa Cros: In these moments I force myself to remember why I entered this industry. And contrary to what some people may think, work colleagues and the hierarchy are also there to support us, no matter the difficulties we encounter.

'David and Goliath' story celebrated at Airbus delivery of 100th A320… - 1819 News,"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovLzE4MTluZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2l0ZW0vZGF2aWQtYW5kLWdvbGlhdGgtc3RvcnktY2VsZWJyYXRlZC1hdC1haXJidXMtZGVsaXZlcnktb2YtMTAwdGgtYTMyMC1haXJsaW5lci10by1kZWx0YS11LXMtc2VuLWJyaXR0LXUtcy1yZXAtY2FybC1vbi1oYW5k0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MOBILE — Monday was a day of celebration in Mobile as Airbus, which Forbes listed as one of the state's top employers in 2022, delivered its 100th A320 Family aircraft to Delta Air Lines.

The Alabama-made A320 is known for having the widest single-aisle cabin in flight, with roomy standard seating and a spacious design. The latest version of the aircraft even provides “unbeatable fuel efficiency,” according to Airbus.

While the jetliner was a sight to see as the backdrop of the celebration at Brookley Aeroplex, several elected officials were on hand to talk about the past, present and future of Airbus in Mobile. Mayor Sandy Stimpson said seeing what has happened in the past 10 years is amazing.

“If Airbus wasn’t performing at a level that very few companies perform at, we probably wouldn’t be here,” said Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson. “And for what they’ve got to do in the future, there are a lot of expectations on what the future is for Airbus.”

Airbus Chairman and CEO C. Jeffrey Knittel shared his appreciation for the city and the hundreds of workers making the aircraft manufacturer successful in the deep south.

“Good morning, Mobile,” said Knittel. “It’s my favorite place in the world. I’m starting to get really comfortable in Alabama, I may have to move here.”

Airbus employs 1,600 people at the manufacturing location, and Knittel said there would soon be even more. He thanked representatives from Delta for being a partner in making the facility what it has become. Knittel noted that the Mobile location has gone from 50 employees to 1,600 and counting.

U.S. Sen. Katie Britt (R-Montgomery) cheered on the teams with Airbus and Delta, as well as county and city leaders, in an enthusiastic speech about goals exceeded in Mobile.

She said not only has leadership cleared the way for economic development but also for educational opportunities and awareness among the younger generation about what is possible.

""It is wonderful to be here as we celebrate this incredible milestone,"" said Britt … ""On days like today, we look to the heavens filled with the belief that our potential has no ceiling and our future is bright.""

U.S. Rep. Jerry Carl (R-Mobile), who was born and raised in Mobile, said that for the place he calls home, the past 10 years with Airbus in town have put the city on the map.

""To be here and to know where we came from, I mean, it was like a David versus Goliath mentality here,"" Carl said. ""… Everybody said we couldn't do it, we wouldn't do it, we can't do it. A little bitty town called Mobile, Alabama became a spot on the map.""

Carl said the sky is the limit for where Airbus is going.

Stimpson closed the ceremony with a toast to all who made Airbus and Mobile successful.

Airbus sounds the death knell for pivot bins on its single-aisle jets - Runway Girl Network,"Thu, 28 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjMvMDkvYWlyYnVzLXNvdW5kcy10aGUtZGVhdGgta25lbGwtZm9yLXBpdm90LWJpbnMtb24tc2luZ2xlLWFpc2xlLWFpcmNyYWZ0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When Airbus started developing its new Airspace cabin for the A320 several years ago, it famously selected a larger flip-up bin rather than the swinging pivot bin it had offered as an option for the aircraft family or indeed other pivot-style solutions available on the retrofit market. The European airframer explained at the time that it wanted to make the A320’s bins lighter, less complex and — crucially — easy for flight attendants to manage.

Now, as Airbus brings the Airspace aesthetic to its A220 family, changing the curved pivot bins of the aircraft formerly known as the C Series to a spacious flip-up version, Airbus vice president cabin marketing Ingo Wuggetzer is ready to call it: “It’s the end of the pivot bin for single-aisle aircraft” in Airbus’ portfolio, he told Runway Girl Network at the APEX/IFSA Global EXPO in Long Beach, citing cabin crew preferences among the reasons for the decision.

Boasting a “consistent DNA” to the popular A320 Airspace cabin, the A220 Airspace interior features a new passenger service unit (PSU) design “completely in line with what we see on the A320”, said Wuggetzer, as well as an under-bin LED lighting solution that offers a vast array of colour options. But, he stressed, “the big feature that is new on the A220” is the Airspace XL Bin, which was developed together with airline customers. “That is showing a lot of improvement in terms of volume” on the A220, he said. “It’s 20% bigger. You have 15% more luggage, 10% more payload, and all of that with 20% less weight.” Major supplier Diehl Aviation has been commissioned to develop and produce the new overhead bins for the A220.

“Plus, we have service benefits because it’s very simple to open and close the bins,” continued the Airbus executive, and as such it’s “a lot easier to operate” because it doesn’t require members of the crew to do any heavy lifting to push up the bin — an especially important consideration given that the A220 workhorse may have several frequencies and turnarounds in one day.

Linefit pivot bins on the A220 will still be in play for some years to come, however, as Airbus won’t be ready to factory-fit the new Airspace cabin to the A220 until 2025 and even then the cutover is expected to take a few years.

Until that time, airlines are taking the classic configuration, with a total 283 A220s delivered to date — the latest in August to Italian flag carrier ITA Airways. The next A220 to be delivered is headed to Qantas, said Wuggetzer.

Meanwhile, the A320 family’s Airspace cabin, inclusive of the XL Bin — which became available in 2021 and is part of “a very steep ramp up plan at Airbus” — is enjoying robust take-up, with Wuggetzer revealing that Airbus has already delivered 110 A320s with Airspace to 11 customers. Japan’s StarFlyer is next in line to take delivery of an A320 with the new cabin, he said.

Notably, with Airbus’ introduction of the A321XLR, expected next year, “the Airspace cabin will get standard in the single-aisle fleet,” said Wuggetzer, That standard includes the XL Bin.

Because the A320 Airspace cabin has proven so popular as a linefit offering, Airbus is also offering it as a light retrofit option called the “Airspace L Bin”. Manufactured by EFW, this bin re-uses many parts of the original bin including the sidewall, ceiling and lighting, as first announced this spring at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg. Lufthansa will be the first retrofit customer, revealed Wuggetzer during the APEX/IFSA Global EXPO, with 38 of the carrier’s A320s slated to be refitted with the Airspace L Bin starting in 2025.

In announcing the arrangement, Wuggetzer highlighted how the retrofit option not only creates a better experience for customers but also for members of crew. “In terms of size, this is the biggest in the market, the clear benchmark in terms of bag size and bag volume” and able to accommodate “one bag for every passenger”, he said.

Lufthansa is certainly keen, noting in a statement that the “large overhead bins can hold up to twice as many carry-on suitcases or bags as the current ‘bins’, because the items of luggage can now be stowed vertically and much more quickly and conveniently in the compartments, which are 40 percent larger”.

As these 38 aircraft are retrofitted with the new bins, they will also get new Geven slimlines, plus a dedicated USB port and a device holder in every seat, said Lufthansa.

A version of Airspace is also available on Airbus’ widebodies, with the first A350 Airspace cabin recently delivered to Air France. Though the cabin otherwise largely offers a very similar design language as on the A320, the Airspace bin for twin-aisle jets is a pivot solution that has proven so unpopular with some crew members that it has even led to litigation due to the strength required to close the bins.

While Airbus may not be quite ready to sound the death knell for the pivot bin on twin-aisle aircraft, it is doing so on single-aisle aircraft. That may beg some questions about the shelf life of certain pivot bin retrofit options for the A320 family.

Airbus to Equip Ro-Ro Vessel with Wind-Power Technology - SupplyChainBrain,"Fri, 29 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1cHBseWNoYWluYnJhaW4uY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzM4MTg4LWFpcmJ1cy10by1lcXVpcC1yby1yby12ZXNzZWwtd2l0aC13aW5kLXBvd2VyLXRlY2hub2xvZ3nSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus will equip one of the ro-ro vessels it uses to transport aircraft sub-assemblies with a wind-assisted propulsion technology that captures wind energy to generate thrust and, therefore, delivers savings in fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions.

The 22-metre (72-feet) high eSAIL, developed by the Barcelona-based firm bound4blue, will be installed on the ro-ro ship Ville de Bordeaux, chartered from shipowner Louis Dreyfus Armateurs. It consists of a sail-like vertical surface and an electric-powered air suction system that helps the airflow to re-adhere to the sail, generating additional lift and thereby reducing the load on the ship’s main engines. Its makers say it creates as much as six to seven times more lift than a conventional rigid sail.

The Ville de Bordeaux regularly ferries A320 Family sub-assemblies from Europe to Mobile in the United States for final assembly. Fitting the eSAILs on the Ville de Bordeaux supports Airbus’ commitment to halve CO 2 emissions from its maritime operations by 2030, compared to a 2015 baseline. The installation is co-funded by the European Union.

“We at Airbus have been studying wind-assisted technologies as a potential energy source for our maritime operations for many years,” said Nicolas Chrétien, head of sustainability & environment at Airbus. “This technology looks promising, and we are eager to start testing it in real conditions by the end of the year.”

David Ferrer, CTO of bound4blue, said: “After having implemented and proven our technology on three ships already, we’re excited to install our 22-metre eSAILs on Ville de Bordeaux. This deployment will mark the first-ever fixed suction sail installation on a ro-ro ship, demonstrating that suction sails can be deployed on ships with high weather deck and large windage area, not compromising the vessel’s stability.”"

Credit: KLM.

Franco-Dutch airline holding company, Air France-KLM Group, has signed an agreement with Airbus for a total of 50 Airbus A350 aircraft, with an option to purchase a further 40 aircraft.

This agreement is set to align with KLM’s plan to renew its older generation long-haul fleet with Airbus A350 family aircraft in the upcoming years.

The 50 aircraft will be divided between KLM and Air France based on local market dynamics and regulatory requirements, according to the company.

According to Airbus, the A350 family which features the A350-900 and A350-1000, has the capacity to fly short and long-haul routes with a range of up to 9,700 nautical miles.

KLM CEO Marjan Rintel emphasised the push for sustainability that aligns with this agreement: “Today marks a very special day for KLM. We have taken a big step towards our future with the proposed decision of purchasing new aircraft.

“We can make our fleet significantly cleaner, quieter and more fuel-efficient with the A350s. This is important because we are all faced with the major task of becoming more sustainable. Furthermore, we can offer our passengers much more service and comfort on intercontinental destinations.”

According to KLM, deployment of the A350 family will commence by 2026 on intercontinental flights, which is set to replace its current fleet of Boeing 777-200ERs, Airbus A330-200s and Airbus A330-300s.

Due to the A350’s specific wing design and its Trent XWB turbofan engines, the A350 family is reported 25% lower fuel burn and CO₂ emissions compared to previous models.

The merger of Air France and KLM in 2004 oversaw the two airlines continuing to operate as separate companies, retaining their own hubs, flights and logos."

They found their solution from Airbus in Toulouse, France.

Airbus will provide Thaicom a fully reconfigurable OneSat. This Thaicom satellite will provide extended connectivity in Ku-band over the Asia-Pacific region . Thaicom has launched and operated eight geostationary satellites. This is Thaicom’s first flexible satellite, allowing for more adaptability on coverage, frequency and capacity which is crucial in such a dynamic region.

Positioned in orbit at 119.5° East, this satellite will enable Thaicom to propose to other partner operators a share of its satellite’s payload capacity, lowering their costs and still ensuring they have separate control of their individual payload capacity and flexibility.

Airbus will design and manufacture the satellite, and also provide ground control segment components. Airbus plans to deliver the satellite in 2027.

Airbus OneSat can be fully reconfigured in orbit, capable of adjusting the coverage area, capacity and frequency “on the fly” to meet evolving mission scenarios. It builds on the heritage of Airbus’ ultra-reliable Eurostar geostationary telecommunication satellites and the company’s constellation expertise with OneWeb. Development of the OneSat program is supported by ESA, as well as the French Space Agency (CNES), and the UK Space Agency.

""I am delighted that we have selected Airbus to build our new generation of software-defined high throughput satellite (HTS). As the world’s leading satellite technology provider, we trust that Airbus will be our best choice for building our new satellite at the strategic location of 119.5 degrees East,"" Patompob Suwansiri, Thaicom's CEO, says. ""It will allow flexibility and instant reconfiguration to adapt dynamically to the service areas and will provide a significant confidence boost for Thaicom’s valued customers and partners throughout Asia Pacific. This is a significant milestone for Thaicom as we forge ahead to further grow our broadband satellite business in the region."""
Airbus Data Breach from a Partner Airline’s Compromised Account Leaks Confidential Information - CPO Magazine,"Wed, 20 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jcG9tYWdhemluZS5jb20vY3liZXItc2VjdXJpdHkvYWlyYnVzLWRhdGEtYnJlYWNoLWZyb20tYS1wYXJ0bmVyLWFpcmxpbmVzLWNvbXByb21pc2VkLWFjY291bnQtbGVha3MtY29uZmlkZW50aWFsLWluZm9ybWF0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has confirmed a data breach that exposed confidential business information via a partner airline’s compromised account.

Threat intelligence firm Hudson Rock said the threat actor ‘USDoD’ compromised a Turkish Airlines employee account using the Redline info-stealer malware in August 2023. The malware targets saved passwords and session cookies, allowing threat actors to bypass multifactor authentication.

Hudson Rock suggested that the Turkish airline employee infected their computer after downloading a “pirated version of the Microsoft .NET framework.”

The threat actor announced the airplane-themed data breach on the 22nd anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks and threatened “Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and the entire defense” industry.

The hacker who was also responsible for an FBI data leak exposed the stolen data on the English language hacking forum BreachForums shortly after joining the ransomware group ‘Ransomed.’

Hudson Rock identified the compromised account before the data breach

Describing the data breach as avoidable, Hudson Rock said it identified the compromised account the same day the infection occurred. Airbus has confirmed that the compromised account was the initial attack vector.

“Airbus’s CERT team was able to determine that the hack originated from the infected computer Hudson Rock identified,” the cybersecurity firm noted.

Airbus launched an investigation and found that the attacker used the compromised account to download confidential information from the Airbus web portal.

Airbus immediately acted to prevent further abuse of the compromised account to contain the data breach.

“Immediate remedial and follow-up measures were taken by our security teams to prevent our systems from being compromised,” Airbus said in a statement.

Hudson Rock has disclosed that the data breach leaked details of 3,200 employees and suppliers, including Thales and Rockwell Collins, exposing their names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. The information could allow threat actors to execute compelling phishing attacks resulting in business email compromise or account takeover attacks.

“Credentials obtained from infostealer infections, which have become the primary initial attack vector in recent years, provide threat actors with easy entry points into companies, facilitating data breaches and ransomware attacks,” Hudson Rock explained.

The threat intelligence firm noted that infostealer infections had surged by 6,000% since 2018 enabling various attacks such as corporate espionage, ransomware, and account takeovers.

The threat actor behind the compromised account was responsible for the FBI ‘InfraGard’ data breach that exposed 80,000 individuals. The individual posted the FBI data on the Breached hacking forum before the law enforcement agency seized the hacking platform prompting threat actors to migrate to other cybercrime sites such as BreachForum.

Aerospace industries a target for threat actors

Although the Airbus data breach was an opportunistic attack, the aerospace industry is a popular target for financially-motivated and state-sponsored threat actors.

“As a major high-tech and industrial player, Airbus is also a target for malicious actors,” the planemaker said.

In 2019, suspected Chinese hackers targeted Airbus’ suppliers to steal trade secrets, including jet engine technology for a military transporter and a commercial plane. In the same year, the airplane maker leaked the personal information of its European employees.

On September 7, 2023, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) also found that multiple state-sponsored cyber actors compromised an Aerospace Organization via Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk vulnerability CVE-2022-47966 and critical FortiOS SSL-VPN flaw CVE-2022-42475. The attackers collected authentication credentials, created privileged accounts, and transversed laterally within the organization.

Samantha Humphries, a Senior Director of International Security Strategy at Exabeam, advised organizations to consider supplier risk when developing their cybersecurity strategy: “Supply chain attacks are a breed of insider threat that all organisations need to be planning for, as they are often a much easier route for cybercriminals to penetrate or circumnavigate defences.”

The Airbus data breach will likely attract the attention of European data regulators."

Airbus’ new extra-long range member of its popular A320 family, the A321XLR, will continue its flight testing programme with an international flight campaign covering 100 hours of flying time across 10 days.

The aircraft’s Functional and Reliability (FnR) Testing is part of the manufacturer’s work to achieve EASA Type Certification for the new A321 variant, expected in 2024, and an effort to demonstrate the aircraft’s systems maturity.

In addition to flying routes that replicate what the aircraft may be doing when in service, the 15 flights will also include real airline cabin and flight crews, alongside the company’s test pilots and flight engineers, and a group of about 30 passengers to provide feedback on the aircraft’s operations.

Jim Fawcett, lead flight test engineer for the FnR, explained the need for this kind of testing, he said: “In the olden days ‘route proving’ was very much about showing customers the aircraft in action – that the aircraft they have bought can actually do what they want to do with it.

“These days we carry on with this kind of demonstration, but we’re also looking at showing the technical reliability and maturity and good functioning of the aircraft. So that’s why we prefer to call it ‘functional and reliability testing’.”

The plane will fly to a number of different environments to test its ability to operate in different temperatures, airport infrastructure, weather conditions and runway altitudes.

Initially the aircraft will fly a number of routes around Europe stemming from the airport in Toulouse, for example one of the flight will take off from Toulouse and approach the North Pole before circling back to France again.

The second part of the test campaign will cover transatlantic operations to and from a US gateway airport, additionally there will be multiple airline and Airbus flight-crew changes in between sectors while ground crews will also treat the flights as if they were operating as part of a real service.

Talking about the ground maintenance teams, Fawcett said: “They will be working with our airline customers in terms of providing us with a fuel truck or a catering service or a water and waste servicing truck – all those kinds of things in just the same way as the airlines do on any of their rotations on any day of the week.”

Airbus’ latest test campaign for the A321XLR follows on from a successful first half of 2023 where the aircraft manufacturer recorded an 11% total revenue increase on H1 2022 and delivered over 300 aircraft, the vast majority of which coming from the same family as new aircraft with 256 A320s being delivered."
Q&A with Airbus Foundation content creator Didier Laval - Airbus,"Fri, 15 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTA5LXFhLXdpdGgtYWlyYnVzLWZvdW5kYXRpb24tY29udGVudC1jcmVhdG9yLWRpZGllci1sYXZhbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus Foundation Discovery Space has just released a new self-development book for teenagers entitled ""The guide to becoming yourself"".

This new booklet guides young people through different topics of self-exploration including self-care, empathy, false information and online safety. It also teaches how to form a unique and powerful individual voice. The booklet equips young people with the tools they need to thrive as they become young adults, taking into account that “becoming yourself” often isn’t as easy as it might sound!

Each chapter contains different activities to put the ideas into practice, alone or with friends and family.

The youth programmes supported by the Foundation aim to inspire young people and give them confidence in their future. The booklet is readily available to participants in Foundation-supported programmes around the world. It is also freely available to download online in English, French, German and Spanish.

To coincide with the launch of this new booklet, we spoke with its author, Didier Laval.

You have been working with the Airbus Foundation for four years developing content for the Youth Development pillar. Why is the Foundation's work in this area important?

Young people today are facing a changing and uncertain world, with challenges ranging from the mental health impact of the Covid pandemic and the growing presence of false information, to new technological revolutions such as the development of artificial intelligence. Educators need new resources, new approaches and new partnerships to equip young people with the tools they need to face these challenges. The Airbus Foundation supports them through a wide variety of tools that help to develop young people’s soft skills and foster a scientific mindset, such as videos, 3D-design activities or our recently released self-development booklet.

How can the Airbus Foundation continue to develop its Youth Development pillar?

The Foundation should ensure they listen to parents, teachers, educators, mediators and even the young people directly engaged in their programmes. Listening to people on the front lines will enable the Foundation to understand how it can support them most effectively.

What are the Foundation’s main projects for 2023, and why are these the top priorities?

In 2023, we are releasing several new resources, with a specific focus on teenagers (14-18 years old). The Foundation’s prior activities were very well adapted to younger children, but the Foundation felt it needed specific tools for teenagers. These resources address that gap.

For example, our new self-development booklet speaks to teenagers at a time in their lives when they are figuring out who they are and who they want to be... It is not an easy age at all! Instead of focusing on “promoting science”, we really get to the heart of a big question that is relevant to all young people at this age: how do you “become yourself”? The booklet also offers activities that will raise awareness of cognitive biases or false information, and in line with our focus on STEM activities.

What is STEM education and how is this approach adapted to the Youth Development activities of the Airbus Foundation?

STEM education means education in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths. It is extremely important, not only for future scientists and engineers, but for every young person. A scientific mindset supports curiosity, critical thinking and problem solving, which are vital skills to adapt to today’s changing world. Many of today’s challenges, from the climate emergency to the rise of AI, are closely linked to scientific issues, so we all need at least a general understanding of scientific culture to be able to engage with and interpret them.

The educational world is becoming more and more digitised. How can we bridge the gap between the different levels of access to the digital world that exist in developed and less developed countries?

This is an extremely important question. Content creators need to be mindful when they design “cutting-edge” digital content that only works on the latest smartphone or that requires very recent hardware. I remember when I asked Derek Fish, Director of the Unizulu Science Centre in South Africa, how he reached the remote and rural communities during the Covid pandemic. Derek told me he used no digital tools at all: his team designed activities on paper, made thousands of black and white photocopies and brought them to remote areas. We need to consider different types of content that are accessible to all.

What are the latest challenges in the world of education and how can educators address them?

The Covid pandemic really impacted young people. Mental health issues have dramatically increased among teenagers. Large groups of children stopped going to school and did not return when schools reopened. Our increasingly digital world has changed the way that young people interact with each other, the way they document themselves, and the kind of media they are interested in. Educators need to reshape many of their approaches to better respond to these changing needs.

What advice would you give to the Foundation's young followers to put themselves on a solid footing for their futures?

Be curious. Always seek out more information, and consult lots of different sources. Today there are so many wonderful podcasts, social media channels, books (don’t forget books!) and videos… Take an interest in as many things as possible. And use what you learn to change the world around you.

Do you think that platforms like YouTube or TikTok are revolutionising education?

The term “revolutionising” might be too strong, but it is true that there is an incredible wealth of educators on social media, especially on channels like Instagram, TikTok and YouTube… You can find educational content about almost every possible topic, from physics to sociology and ecology to pop culture. And through social media, teenagers can curate their preferred educators, and learn from people who address them as equals. This is very empowering. So perhaps instead of a “revolution”, I would say there is an educational “tidal wave” on social media!"

Airbus Teams Up With DG Fuels To Drive SAF Production - Aviation Week,"Thu, 14 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9zcGVjaWFsLXRvcGljcy9zdXN0YWluYWJsZS1hdmlhdGlvbi1mdWVsL2FpcmJ1cy10ZWFtcy1kZy1mdWVscy1kcml2ZS1zYWYtcHJvZHVjdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has formed a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) strategic partnership with Washington D.C.-based DG Fuels (DGF).

The partnership will use a new fuel-production system developed by DGF to source SAF from a wider range of waste and residue sources. It will run entirely on cellulosic waste products, such as wood waste from the logging industry, coupled with renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power.

The company’s first SAF plant, set for construction in Louisiana, will aim to have an average annual production capacity of 120 million U.S. gallons (454 million liters) by 2026.

Michael Darcy, Chairman and CEO at DG Fuels, enthusiastic at the partnership with Airbus, said once the Louisiana facility was up and running, they plan to expand by opening more facilities within the U.S., but only later would they consider large-scale production worldwide."
Airbus unveils PioneerLab twin-engine flying laboratory - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 25 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLXVudmVpbHMtcGlvbmVlcmxhYi10d2luLWVuZ2luZS1mbHlpbmctbGFib3JhdG9yeS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus PioneerLab demonstrator has been created to test new technologies that enhance efficiency and autonomy in twin-engine aircraft.

Airbus Helicopters has unveiled its latest technology demonstrator, designed to test technologies that reduce emissions, increase autonomy and integrate bio-based materials.

The PioneerLab is a twin-engine demonstrator, based on the popular H145 platform. It follows on the heels of the single-engine demonstrator aircraft FlightLab (based on an H130, and designed to test technology “bricks” that could be incorporated into the company’s existing fleet) and DisruptiveLab (a clean-sheet design created to test new architectures and concepts).

“With PioneerLab, we continue our ambitious strategy to test and mature new technologies on board our helicopter demonstrators,” said Tomasz Krysinski, head of research and innovation programs at Airbus Helicopters. “PioneerLab, which is based in Germany at our Donauwörth site, will be our platform to test technologies specifically dedicated to twin-engine helicopters.”

Through the use of a hybrid electric propulsion system and aerodynamic improvements, PioneerLab aims to achieve a 30 percent reduction in fuel compared to a conventional H145.

Airbus Helicopters will also flight-test structural components made from bio-based and recycled materials, with the aim of reducing the environmental footprint across the aircraft lifecycle. The company intends to produce the parts using processes that reduce material and energy consumption and improve recyclability.

The company said further research activities will include the integration of the latest digital technologies into the aircraft’s flight control system and associated sensors, which will provide increased autonomy and safety during critical flight phases such as takeoff and landing.

PioneerLab was unveiled during the German National Aviation Conference in Hamburg, Germany, and is partially co-funded by the BMWK, the Federal German Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Actions through its national research program LuFo.

Airbus Helicopters said it has already begun the flight test campaign with PioneerLab at its German headquarters in Donauwörth, with a rotor strike alerting system being the first techno-brick tested on board the demonstrator. The next phase will be to test an automated take-off and landing system, the company said."
Air France-KLM To Order 50 Airbus A350 Family Aircraft - Aviation Week,"Mon, 25 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcmxpbmVzLWxlc3NvcnMvYWlyLWZyYW5jZS1rbG0tb3JkZXItNTAtYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtZmFtaWx5LWFpcmNyYWZ00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS—Air France-KLM announced it will place an order for 50 Airbus A350 family aircraft to be delivered starting in 2026, with purchase rights for 40 more, to replace A330s and older Boeing 777 aircraft as the Franco-Dutch group continues its fleet renewal and rationalization efforts.



The group order, which is subject to standard company approvals, will cover 50 Airbus A350-900 and A350-1000 aircraft, along with purchase rights for 40 additional aircraft. First deliveries are expected in 2026 with remaining deliveries continuing through 2030.



“This will be an evolutionary order, providing the group with flexibility to allocate aircraft within its portfolio of airlines, according to market dynamics and local regulatory conditions,” the airline group said Sept. 25.



Air France-KLM CEO Benjamin Smith, who has made fleet renewal a priority since taking over in 2018, said: “This new order will be a major step in the renewal of the group’s fleet. The Airbus A350 is a state-of-the-art aircraft with an excellent track record at Air France, where it has rapidly become a favorite among passengers and crew since its entry into service in 2019.”



Smith said the quieter, more fuel-efficient, and more cost-effective aircraft was “the perfect fit for the network needs of the group.”

He added: “It will be instrumental in helping the group reach our ambitious sustainability targets, including -30% CO2 emissions per passenger kilometer by 2030.”



The much-anticipated new order comes in addition to an existing Air France-KLM order for 41 A350-900s for Air France, of which 22 have been delivered to date. Air France-KLM is also set to be among the launch customers of the A350 Full Freighter version of the aircraft, having ordered eight aircraft to renew and expand its cargo fleet.



The combined orders of up to 99 aircraft would make Air France-KLM the world’s largest operator of A350 aircraft, the group said.

By 2028, the share of new generation aircraft in the group’s fleet is set to reach 64%, up from 5% in 2019.



As of Sept. 25, Air France-KLM is operating a fleet of 533 aircraft. Once the latest order is placed, the group will have over 220 aircraft on order, including 100 A320neo family aircraft, with first deliveries expected by the end of 2023.



Efforts to renew and rationalize its fleet are important not only for Air France-KLM’s decarbonization efforts but also as part of its drive to increase competitiveness. Newer, more efficient aircraft are also a valuable tool in fighting growing cost pressures amid high oil prices which are hurting the industry.



Since Smith took over, the group has made progress in its fleet renewal, retiring its A340s and A380s during the coronavirus pandemic and placing some significant orders for new aircraft.

It has 60 A220s on order, around half of which have already been delivered, with the rest due to join the fleet by the end of 2025. The group has opted for the A320neo family for fleet renewal at KLM, Transavia Netherlands and Transavia France, with aircraft set to enter the KLM fleet in 2024, later than planned because of replacing Boeing 737 NGs.



Fleet renewal is under particular scrutiny for KLM, as the carrier seeks to convince authorities that it can cut noise at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol by itself, and that a government plan to cap flights to reduce noise is not needed."
ZeroAvia completes another financing round led by Airbus - Electrek,"Thu, 21 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vZWxlY3RyZWsuY28vMjAyMy8wOS8yMS96ZXJvYXZpYS1jb21wbGV0ZXMtc3VjY2Vzc2Z1bC1maW5hbmNpbmctcm91bmQtYWlyYnVzLW5lb20tZWxlY3RyaWMtcGxhbmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hydrogen-electric plane developer ZeroAvia has snagged some additional financial security as it looks to continue development of its zero-emissions flight technology that should one day enable flights in 76-seat aircrafts. The latest financing round featured some familiar names as well as some leading investments from Airbus, Barclays, and Saudi Arabia’s “living laboratory,” NEOM.

ZeroAvia is an aircraft developer focused specifically on hydrogen-electric propulsion that continues to hit milestones across a previously laid out development timeline that spans a decade. We’ve already seen the company secure experimental flight certificates from both the CAA in the UK and the FAA in the US – home to its two current headquarters.

In January, ZeroAvia completed its first flight with its 19-passenger hydrogen-electric plane – the largest to take to the skies at the time. However, the company has its eyes set on larger and more powerful planes, vowing to deliver a 40- to 80-seat aircraft with up to 700 miles of range by 2027.

That’s no small task, and such development requires massive funding – a key factor ZeroAvia has found plenty of support in over the years. For example, Alaska Airlines has been a prominent investor over the years and is currently co-developing a hydrogen-electric plan with ZeroAvia seen below.

Alaska was also part of a $30 million funding round, completed in the summer of 2022, that also features investments from Barclays’ Sustainable Impact Capital and Saudi Arabia’s city of the future – NEOM. Today, Barclays and NEOM have joined Alaska Airlines in a fresh funding round that also includes a new partnership with another behemoth in the aerial segment – Airbus.

ZeroAvia looks to accelerate electric plane development

In addition to the investors mentioned above, today’s fresh round of funding included Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Horizons Ventures, Ecosystem Integrity Fund, Summa Equity, AP Ventures, and Amazon Climate Pledge Fund.

As part of Airbus’ investment, it has signed an agreement with ZeroAvia to work together in obtaining hydrogen power system certifications. The two companies said they will also collaborate in the development of adjacent technical areas, including liquid hydrogen fuel storage, testing fuel cell propulsion systems (ground on air), and development of refueling infrastructure. Per Airbus vice president of ZEROe aircraft Glenn Llewellyn:

ZeroAvia has already been successful in flight testing fuel cell propulsion, and hydrogen storage and distribution systems on board their Do-228 flight test platform which puts them in a strong position to take their technologies to the next phase of development. In addition, ZeroAvia is supporting the development of a wider hydrogen ecosystem for aviation – technologies, decarbonized hydrogen supply and certification of hydrogen propulsion systems – which all complement well with our own ambition to bring a ZEROe hydrogen powered aircraft to service by 2035.

ZeroAvia states the funding will be used to further expedite the development of its hydrogen-electric propulsion technology as it seeks official certification for commercial flight. That first aircraft will be the ZA600, whose prototype has already begun its first stage of test flights. The company is currently targeting 2025 certification for that aircraft, which should be able to transport up to 20 passengers.

Some of the funds will also be allocated toward ZeroAvia’s larger propulsion program – the ZA2000, which features a 2-5.4 MW powertrain designed for larger commercial aircraft. The next step in that project is testing of a retrofitted Dash 8 400 aircraft with Alaska Airlines, capable of transporting 76 passengers. First test flights are expected to take place next year."

Artemis II astronauts discover a key component of the Orion spacecraft - Airbus,"Wed, 27 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTA5LWFydGVtaXMtaWktYXN0cm9uYXV0cy1kaXNjb3Zlci1hLWtleS1jb21wb25lbnQtb2YtdGhlLW9yaW9uLXNwYWNlY3JhZnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Becoming an astronaut is a rigorous process. After being selected, recruits have to endure a lengthy and intense training period before they can head into Space. Understanding the hardware they’ll rely on is vital, as astronauts for the upcoming Artemis II Moon mission experienced during a visit to the Airbus site in Bremen, where Orion’s European Service Module (ESM) - half of the spacecraft that will return humans to the Moon - is designed and manufactured.

Whether it’s swimming in a flight suit or experiencing weightlessness inside a modified aircraft performing parabolic manoeuvres, we may well have seen images of astronauts preparing their bodies for the harsh environment of space. Nevertheless, for Artemis astronauts an equally important part of their preparation is to understand the Orion vehicle they will operate. This was the objective of their recent visit to Bremen, Germany.

“We have a training flow and path to be ready to go to the International Space Station (ISS) but for Artemis, it doesn't exist yet. We are co-creating it, right now, with the team,” said Jeremy Hansen, one of the Artemis II astronauts.

With Artemis I - the uncrewed Moon-orbiting mission - the spacecraft was subjected to maximum stress to test its performance. The flight was successfully completed in late 2022 and proved that Orion is ready to fly astronauts. “The objective with Artemis II is more to orient the spacecraft towards the life of the crew in the capsule,"" said Philippe Deloo, Orion ESM Programme Manager for the European Space Agency (ESA). Airbus has been contracted by ESA to build the service modules for NASA under a transatlantic partnership.

“Everyday will be the first day”

NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Hammock Koch and the Canadian Space Agency’s (CSA) astronaut Jeremy Hansen spent two days at the Airbus Bremen site in September 2023. They visited the cleanrooms, where the different modules are integrated, and also met the engineers who designed the spacecraft, starting ten years ago. “Seeing the work that the engineers are putting on every single little surface in that service module, their dedication, has been really impactful. Some engineers have been working on this mission far longer than we have and in some cases longer than I’ve even been an astronaut,” said Christina Koch.

The main task of the Artemis II crew during their ten-day mission will be to test out many of the systems Orion will need on future missions. They will check the vehicle in respect to all aspects of living on board, manoeuvering it manually and ensuring the vehicle is ready.

“We will take the spacecraft to the corner of the envelope and be confident that we can come home safely if we have an issue. As this flight will be the first one with a crew, it is still difficult to identify precisely the needs. We are part of the testing process by working with the experts, learning from each other,”explained Jeremy Hansen.“There are so many unique aspects in this mission as everything is new, everyday will be the first day,” added Victor Glover.

With this objective in mind, it’s important that the astronauts spend time with the experts who designed and developed the ESM and learn everything about the module that will support them during their mission. Indeed the European Service Module (ESM) is considered the “heart” of the Orion spacecraft. It provides critical functions including propulsion, electrical power generated by solar arrays, thermal control, and last but not least the life support system including oxygen and water. “One of the primary things we have to do is to survive: to eat, sleep, use the bathroom for ten days and the system has to be able to support that,” said Victor Glover.

When meeting the faces behind the machine changes everything

Imagining flying for the first time in a completely new vehicle, in real space conditions, launched at a speed of about 11 kilometers per second, creates a lot of different feelings for the crew. “At the end of the day, something can go wrong that you don’t expect,” said Reid Wiseman.

Ensuring the crew understands exactly where the spacecraft is going and what it’s doing as well as potential issues with the subsystems are key. Security and safety are at the core of the mission so building a trustful relationship with the Airbus teams significantly contributes to the good mindset of the crew. “Meeting people, seeing the hardware, the operational things we’ve done like this one provide a lot of confidence. For me, human interaction is so important,” said Koch.

These two days in Bremen allowed the crew to learn more about the ESM, including the redundancies in the systems, to see in reality what they read in the manuals, and exchange in full transparency with the engineers.

The resulting trust and close cooperation with the ESM team made a positive difference for the crew.

Artemis Programme in a nutshell:

The Orion spacecraft is part of NASA’s Artemis programme that will carry astronauts from Earth to the lunar vicinity and return them back home.

The Artemis II crew will orbit around the Moon in 2024.

The Artemis III mission, when humans will land on the Moon, is set for 2025.

The Orion spacecraft is composed of three main components: the crew module, the launch abort system and the European Service Module (ESM).

The ESM provides support to the Orion’s crew module from launch through separation prior to entry.

European aircraft manufacturer Airbus said it would continue to increase investment in China, its largest single-country market, and expand its supply chain in the country by cooperating with more Chinese suppliers, including startups, driven by China's strong demand for new aircraft and rapid recovery of the air travel market.

This year marks the 15th anniversary of the inauguration of Airbus' final assembly facility in Tianjin. Opened in 2008, the facility serves as the first Airbus commercial aircraft assembly line outside of Europe.

Airbus plans to further expand its A320 fleet's final assembly capacity in Tianjin with a second line currently under construction. The new facility is expected to be put into operation and begin delivery by the end of 2025, and Airbus is highly confident it will complete it on time.

Alberto Gutierrez

Alberto Gutierrez, chief operating officer of Airbus, said during his first visit to China this week in Tianjin that he was impressed with the country's development and infrastructure and Airbus will continue to invest in China.

""As a foreign company, we have been developing in China for decades. We are extremely confident in China. Our growth and investment in China speak for themselves,"" Gutierrez said.

Meanwhile, George Xu, Airbus executive vice-president and Airbus China CEO, added that China's economic growth relies on globalization and connectivity. China aims to achieve high-quality development by focusing on innovation and decarbonization, and Airbus can play a crucial role in supporting such a trend, he said.

Currently, Airbus operates four A320 final assembly sites worldwide, located in Hamburg, Germany; Toulouse, France; Mobile, Alabama, the United States; and Tianjin, China.

The company said it tailors the management and operations of its final assembly lines in different regions to local conditions. Tianjin embodies a practical culture and the Tianjin line boasts significant competitiveness and growth opportunities.

Airbus manages more than 13,000 suppliers globally. In the post-COVID era, it aims to gradually increase production capacity and better maintain the stability of its supply chain. The company also plans to directly manage more second- and third-tier suppliers in addition to first-tier.

In China, Airbus has some 200 suppliers. Chinese suppliers have been doing well in terms of competitiveness and safety, it said. In 2020, the total value of Airbus' supply chain in China reached $1 billion.

Airbus said it is considering the potential to extend cooperation with more Chinese startups as its suppliers, and it would like to recommend those Chinese companies to its research center in Suzhou Industrial Park in Jiangsu province.

Passenger demand for international travel continues to grow globally. In June, total air traffic numbers globally resumed to 94.2 percent of the level seen in June 2019, according to the International Air Transport Association, which is comprised of over 300 airlines.

In the first six months, China's civil aviation transport maintained its recovery and growth momentum, almost reaching the level seen in 2019 before the pandemic, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China.

In the meantime, the second C919, China's first self-developed narrow-body aircraft, was put into commercial operation by China Eastern Airlines in August, serving travelers between Shanghai and Chengdu, Sichuan province."
Airbus adds Intelsat and Panasonic as MSPs for HBCplus - Runway Girl Network,"Wed, 20 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjMvMDkvYWlyYnVzLWFkZHMtaW50ZWxzYXQtYW5kLXBhbmFzb25pYy1hcy1tc3BzLWZvci1zdXBwbGllci1mdXJuaXNoZWQtaWZjL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After inking memorandums of understanding with Intelsat and Panasonic Avionics Corporation earlier this year, Airbus has firmed up agreements with each company to formally add them as Ku-band managed service providers (MSPs) on its supplier-furnished, linefit Airspace Link HBCplus inflight connectivity programme. The European airframer used the occasion of the APEX/IFSA Global EXPO in Long Beach to make the announcement.

“Intelsat and Panasonic Avionics Corporation have respectively signed contracts and are thus confirmed as launch managed service providers (MSPs) for the Ku-band multi-orbit LEO/GEO HBCplus offering,” says Airbus.

As previously reported, Airbus has chosen Safran Passenger Innovations (SPI) to provide the Ku-band satcom hardware for the programme, integrating Get SAT’s electronically steerable antenna (ESA) in the terminal. Aircraft are expected to be delivered linefit with the kit starting in 2026. In the near-term, Airbus will install and test the hardware on its Airbus Explorer A350-900 testbed aircraft, Airbus vice president cabin marketing Ingo Wuggetzer tells RGN.

Notably, the Get SAT antenna will unlock “simultaneous multi-beam operation” for HBCplus Ku-band services as it can talk to both Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and GEO satellites at the same time. That’s important to both Intelsat and Panasonic, which are each pursuing plans to deliver multi-orbit LEO/GEO services to airlines.

A vertically integrated service provider, Intelsat operates its own network of GEO satellites, and is a distribution partner for OneWeb’s LEO service in aero. Panasonic’s network represents a cadre of agreements with GEO satellite operators from around the world, including Intelsat, and it too is a OneWeb distribution partner in aero.

Under the Airspace Link HBCplus programme, Airbus provides the broadband connectivity kit — and related services — as linefit supplier furnished equipment (SFE) meaning that it not only factory-fits the hardware to A320, A330 and A350 twinjets, but has overall responsibility to airline customers. In time, it will also offer HBCplus as a retrofit solution. The programme is groundbreaking in that it enables participating airlines to switch bandwidth suppliers without changing the linefit IFC hardware on their aircraft.

Airbus officially launched the programme in 2022, first naming Inmarsat (now Viasat) as a Ka-band MSP with its GEO-focused service offering, and later SES as MSP for multi-orbit MEO/GEO service, using a SPI terminal with ThinKom Solutions’ proven Ka2517 VICTS antenna as core. Since then, Emirates and Ethiopian Airlines have signed on as customers, tapping Viasat as their MSP. According to Airbus, many more customers are in the offing.

“[O]ur expanding catalogue of selected managed service provider partners — now joined by Intelsat and Panasonic Avionics Corporation — will deliver a fantastic customer experience for airlines’ Airbus family aircraft through lightning fast Internet in-flight,” assures Maximilian Ruecker, who serves as VP cabin procurement seats, IFE and electronics at Airbus.

Panasonic and Intelsat already enjoy linefit offerability at Airbus for their current Ku-band GEO IFC solutions as part of the airframer’s buyer furnished equipment (BFE) catalogue. Whilst Airbus still offers the BFE catalogue, it admits that its “energy and focus” is now on developing HBCplus SFE. In time, there will “a transition phase”, says Wuggetzer, noting that: “There is a clearly stronger demand on HBCplus.”

For Intelsat, inclusion in the supplier-furnished HBCplus programme means the ability to provide even greater choice to airlines.

“Understanding that no airline is like any other, Intelsat has long offered flexibility and choice to its customers, including fit-for-purpose equipment options, and a variety of business models and passenger service offerings,” says Intelsat senior vice president of commercial aviation Dave Bijur. “With Airbus, we are offering a new level of sophistication and flexibility that leverages the high throughput of GEO satellites with the low latency delivered by LEO satellites.”

For Panasonic, HBCplus “aligns perfectly with our multi-orbit strategy and will seamlessly integrate with our LEO and GEO connectivity solutions”, says John Wade, vice president of Panasonic Avionics’ inflight connectivity business unit. “We understand the needs of airlines and OEMs alike. By offering HBCplus we are providing airlines with a greater choice of connectivity services, and ultimately enhancing the passenger experience.”

RGN asked Airbus if there is any room for additional MSPs in the HBCplus programme. “Actually, I think we have an exciting offer, all SFE, a great choice, but we’re always open to improvement,” says Wuggetzer, noting that “if there is a need” and an interest on the part of airlines, “why not?” That flexibility is, however, largely on the MSP side, versus the linefit hardware.

Down the road, Airbus is also ultimately eyeing the possibility of offering a multi-band solution as part of HBCplus, but says it is currently focused on the priorities already announced."

"Airbus takes its long, thin, plane on a ten-day test campaign - The Register","Thu, 14 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA5LzE0L2EzMjF4bHJfYWlyYnVzX2Z1bmN0aW9uYWxfdGVzdGluZy_SAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vQU1QLzIwMjMvMDkvMTQvYTMyMXhscl9haXJidXNfZnVuY3Rpb25hbF90ZXN0aW5nLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has commenced functional and reliability testing of its A321XLR, a passenger plane expected to open up new routes by allowing the aviation workhorse that is the A320 family to easily handle transatlantic trips and journeys of ten hours or more.

The XLR in A321XLR stands for ""extra long range"" – a moniker earned by the plane's ability to fly 4,700 nautical miles (8,700km or 5400 miles). That range puts long flights – like London to Los Angeles, Sydney to Tokyo, or New York to Rio De Janeiro – within reach of a single-aisle plane.

Scarcity of landing slots at big airports means few international airlines will use the 200-seater for those routes, because larger planes offer greater profit potential.

The A321XLR is instead designed to let carriers fly ""long, thin"" routes – long journeys that don't have huge passenger demand. It's currently hard to fly such routes profitably. Airbus hopes the A321XLR interests airlines that want to explore such flights, safe in the knowledge that it's just an A320 variant that can be pressed into service on other routes by existing crews trained on less long-legged versions of the type.

Airbus explained that the functional and reliability testing program's main aim is ""to demonstrate the A321XLR's systems maturity well before entry into service, with a target of approximately 100 hours flying time over ten days with no systems power-down.""

The testing will involve flying around 15 sectors that Airbus reckons are ""typical of what airlines might fly when the aircraft enters service"" as they mix up different climatic conditions, flight durations, and airport turnaround times. Some of the test flights will see the demo plane fly from Airbus HQ in Toulouse, France, to near the NorthPole and back to Toulouse. Others will stay within Europe. Another test flight will cross the Atlantic, touch down at what Airbus has described as ""a US gateway airport,"" and then fly home.

Airbus pilots and engineers will be aboard the flight, as will 30 staff who volunteer as passengers.

Those volunteers get to experience the full commercial cabin interior being used in the test plane, and therefore endure long-ish haul flight in a 3-3 economy class configuration.

Widebody jets currently used on flights of the length the A321XLR will conduct boast two aisles, and therefore offer a little space in which to stand and stretch. Airbus's new model will be rather less roomy, leaving airlines to decide if they want to cram passengers in or choose cabin layouts that offer more comfort.

Those decisions are probably being made now: Airbus has orders for over 400 A321XLRs, and the craft is expected to enter service in 2024. The plane maker delivered over 500 of the A320 family last year, so once the A321XLR is certified there's every chance they'll quickly start to appear in airline fleets. ®"
