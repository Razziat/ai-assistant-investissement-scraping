New Airbus beds will let passengers sleep in the cargo hold - CNN,"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAxOC8wOS8yOC9zdWNjZXNzL2FpcmJ1cy1jYXJnby1ob2xkLWJlZHMvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBQWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMTgvMDkvMjgvc3VjY2Vzcy9haXJidXMtY2FyZ28taG9sZC1iZWRz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Editor’s Note: This story was originally published April 11, 2018

CNN Business —

Airbus has found a new way for passengers to stretch out – as long as they’re willing to sleep in the cargo hold.

The European airplane maker has partnered with France’s Zodiac Aerospace to create cargo sleeper berths for Airbus A330 jets. They’ll be available to airlines by 2020.

The mini-cabins – or passenger modules, as Airbus (EADSF) and Zodiac (ZODFF) describe them – will sit directly on the cargo floor and will not affect the loading of freight and luggage.

Airlines will be able to swap the sleeping modules in and out of planes in place of regular cargo containers, the companies said.

“We have already received very positive feedback from several airlines on our first mock-ups,” Geoff Pinner, head of cabin and cargo operations at Airbus, said in a statement.

Designs provided by the companies showed rows of double-decker beds on either side of a corridor. Mock-up drawings also showed larger spaces for families, medical care or meetings.

While the exact use and pricing of the berths is yet to be determined, they are designed to be offered as an add-on option on long haul flights for passengers who want to get up from their seats and lie down, Airbus spokesman Jacques Rocca told CNN.

Passengers will purchase a regular seat on the aircraft, paying extra for a bed at a price to be determined by airlines. They would access the cargo hold via a staircase.

Claustrophobia sufferers may have a problem, however, as the cabins don’t appear to have windows.

Rocca said high definition display screens Airbus is developing to replace windows could be deployed in the cargo passenger cabins.

Carriers will be able to order new A330 jets fitted with the modules, or retrofit planes already in service.

There are more than 1,300 A330s currently in operation around the world with carriers including Air China (AIRYY), Etihad Airways and Lufthansa (DLAKY).

Airbus is also considering introducing the new modules in its A350 XWB planes, which are currently flown by airlines including Delta (DAL), Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines (SINGF)."
"Airbus Perlan Mission II glider soars to 76000 feet to break own altitude record, surpassing even U-2 reconnaissance ... - Airbus","Mon, 03 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wOS1haXJidXMtcGVybGFuLW1pc3Npb24taWktZ2xpZGVyLXNvYXJzLXRvLTc2MDAwLWZlZXQtdG8tYnJlYWstb3du0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Stratospheric glider yielding insights into high-altitude aerodynamics, flight safety and Martian exploration

For the third time in a week, Airbus Perlan Mission II has set a new world altitude record for a glider, this time soaring the engineless Perlan 2 to 76,124 feet, in the process collecting vital data on flight performance, weather and the atmosphere.

Yesterday’s flight by pilots Jim Payne and Tim Gardner surpasses even the maximum recorded altitude in level flight of the U.S. Air Force’s famous U-2 Dragon Lady reconnaissance aircraft: 73,737 feet, flown by pilot Jerry Hoyt on Apr. 17, 1989.

The U-2 is powered by an engine that generates 17,000 lbs. of thrust. By contrast, the Perlan 2 is engineless, weighs just 1,500 pounds, and soars to its record altitudes on rare stratospheric air currents formed by mountain winds combining with the Polar Vortex.

“World records are gratifying evidence of progress toward a goal, but the goal itself is advancing our knowledge and expertise,” said Tom Enders, Airbus CEO. “By exploring an underexplored part of the atmosphere, Perlan is teaching us about efficient high-altitude flight, about detecting natural sources of lift and avoiding turbulence, and even about the viability of wing-borne exploration of Mars. As a company that makes not just airliners but also high-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles such as Zephyr as well as the Mars rover robotic vehicle, every Perlan flight is an investment in our future.”

In a single week, Perlan has set and then surpassed a world altitude record three times:

Aug. 26, 2018: Jim Payne and Morgan Sandercock soar to 63,100 feet, besting the record of 54,000 feet set by Airbus Perlan Mission II on Sept. 3, 2017

Aug. 28, 2018: Jim Payne and Miguel Iturmendi reach 65,600 feet

Sept. 2, 2018: Jim Payne and Tim Gardner climb to 76,124 feet

The overall altitude record for level flight of a manned airplane is held by the SR-71 Blackbird at 85,069 feet. The pressurized Perlan 2 glider is designed to fly to 90,000 feet, conditions permitting.

Airbus Perlan Mission II will continue its 2018 flying season through mid-September, when the season for stratospheric mountain waves in the southern hemisphere begins to die down, and the all-volunteer Perlan Project team will return from Patagonia to homes in the U.S. and around the world. The number of flights remaining will be determined by weather conditions.

Viewers around the world are following Perlan flights live as they occur on the Airbus Perlan Mission II Virtual Cockpit: http://bit.ly/VirtualPerlan2. The Virtual Cockpit shows the glider’s altitude, airspeed, remaining oxygen, map position, and even live streaming video from a camera in the tail when the aircraft is in range.

The Airbus A320 is one of the most popular airliners in the world.

It's also Europe's answer to Boeing's stalwart 737, which was until recently the best selling airliner of all time. However, the A320 is quickly catching up.

Through the end of February 2020, Airbus has sold a whopping 15,522 A320s and its derivatives, while Boeing has sold 15,156 737s. It's worth noting that Airbus just passed Boeing in late-2019, even though Boeing began selling the 737 nearly two decades before the A320's launch in 1984.

Q&A with Samantha Stinson of Airbus - Wichita State University,"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpY2hpdGEuZWR1L2Fib3V0L3dzdW5ld3MvbmV3cy8yMDE4LzA5LXNlcHQvUUFTdGluc29uLnBocNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Samantha Stinson grew up in an aviation family and didn't see herself working in that field. Her family moved six times – including Tucson, Denver and China - before she landed in Wichita at age 12.

Stinson's father worked as an in-service repair engineer.

“I would go to his office as a kid and it was manuals on manuals on manuals – so much paper and he was always on the phone,” she said. “I didn't see how there was anything that could ever be fun about aviation.”

That lifestyle didn't appeal to her when she started at Wichita State. Her internship at Airbus on Wichita State's Innovation Campus changed her mind. Stinson started in Jan. 2017 as a marketing and business development applied learning student with the National Institute for Aviation Research, placed at Airbus.

“I came in here and the people were so nice and the work that I do is so interesting, it's so intriguing,” she said. “I do something different almost every day, every week. It's innovative. This company moves so fast that there's always a challenge. I love a challenge. I love doing different things. I love event planning.”

Stinson started on a three-month internship for business development plans. That three-month plan turned into much more work on marketing, events such as the Root Beer Kegger and business development.

“Slowly, I really integrated myself into the office,” she said. “I worked with pretty much our whole management team on a variety of projects. The last couple months, I've been really integrated into the WSU community and ‘How do we make ourselves a member of this community?'”

Alyssa Calbert Samantha Stinson

Now aviation is definitely a part of her life and may be a part of her future. She graduated in December with a degree in marketing and is pursuing a Master's of Business Administration.

Why is it important for Airbus to become more a part of the Wichita State campus?

Ultimately, everybody who is on this campus is a future customer of Airbus. If you're fine arts student, an engineer, a math major – you're going to fly on an airplane. And every person who flies on an airplane is an Airbus customer. It's important that we leave our mark here.

We want to everybody to see us as a brand they recognize. We're on campus because we can be close to NIAR and all of the talent. But it's also important that people know we're here to be a part of the community and to sustain the aerospace pipeline.

How do you define applied learning and why is it so important at Wichita State?

Applied learning is taking what you learn in a textbook, understanding the definitions, and then using it in real life.

You really to get see what those decisions look like. Everything sounds so easy in a textbook.

Getting these experiences while you're in college gives you such an advantage. Being an applied learning student, I can go ask all the dumb questions. You will never succeed without a degree, but you definitely have to learn all the, I would say, street skills of business. That's what applied learning teaches you.

Why did you decide to pursue an MBA?

I really love the strategic viewpoint, the big-picture decisions. I've always really enjoyed leadership. So I thought, ‘Ok, instead of double-majoring in management and marketing, why don't I go ahead and get a Master's degree? An MBA opens up a lot of opportunities for me in the future to move into a management role, but I also have the expertise of marketing.

I decided to do the data analytics concentration because that also ties back into marketing. It really is the future. That's what Airbus has taught me more than anything--how important data analytics is, how important understanding what the future looks like is for your career. What business looked like when I was a freshman versus what the business world looks like now is completely different.

If you don't stay up to date with technology and the way things are moving, you won't succeed. Luckily, I've gotten a view and a peek into the industry and I've worked in corporate life for about a year-and-a-half, so when I do graduate I'm going to be ready to move into the work-force and I'm going to integrate a lot easier into a company.

Why has data analytics made such an impression on your career plans?

I've learned that productivity is so important. Understanding what all these numbers mean and how they affect a business is so interesting to me. The impact that productivity has on our charge rate and how much we can charge a customer for business development – all these things are driven by so many little data points.

Seeing how it all comes together, I think, gives you a big advantage in the market. It can give a company a big competitive advantage. Understanding that is really going to help me in my career.

What advice would you give a prospective Wichita State student?

I would tell them that it's ok to be involved, it's ok to do the clubs. They're a lot of fun. Look outside of that - look for internships, reach out to the Career Development Center to see what they can do to help you. Reach out to your teachers to see what they can offer.

My freshman year, I said, ‘Nope, I'm only going to be involved on campus.' If I hadn't decided to see what else is out there, I may never have ended up here. The opportunities that are available on this campus and in Wichita itself are just enormous. Koch Industries is two, three miles (from campus). Cargill is downtown.

There are just so many opportunities that can do so much for you and put you so far ahead. You build so many great relationships. I would really encourage students to look outside of the norm, reach outside their comfort zone. I didn't want to apply at Airbus because I didn't want to work in aviation. But, I took the chance and it put me here. I love my job. I can see myself working in aviation. I'd be happy to stay here."

Singapore receives new Airbus tankers to replace Boeing aircraft - Defense News,"Wed, 05 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS8yMDE4LzA5LzA1L3NpbmdhcG9yZS1yZWNlaXZlcy1uZXctYWlyYnVzLXRhbmtlcnMtdG8tcmVwbGFjZS1ib2VpbmctYWlyY3JhZnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MELBOURNE, Australia — The first of six Airbus A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transports has been delivered to Singapore according to the French manufacturer.

In a news release, Airbus Defence and Space confirmed the delivery, adding that the aircraft made its first official public appearance on Sept. 1, 2018, at the 50th anniversary parade of the Republic of Singapore Air Force. The aircraft had flown into Singapore’s Changi East Air Base from Madrid, Spain, on Aug. 14.

The new tanker will replace four Boeing KC-135R Stratotankers the Air Force has been operating since the late 1990s. All four KC-135Rs were former U.S. Air Force ""A"" models brought out from storage and upgraded before being transferred to Singapore. The oldest of these aircraft is approaching 60 years old.

Airbus says the new-generation A330 MRTT will extend the endurance of the Air Force’s fighter aircraft and ensures the service’s continued capability to provide air-to-air refueling support. The Air Force currently operates 60 Lockheed Martin F-16C/D Fighting Falcons and 40 Boeing F-15SG Eagles.

RELATED

Some of the service’s F-16 pilots already have experience receiving fuel from the A330 MRTT, having carried out receiver certification flights with Royal Australian Air Force MRTTs as well as receiving fuel from the type during multinational exercises like the recently concluded Exercise Pitch Black in Australia.

Singapore’s MRTTs are powered by the Rolls-Royce Trent 700-series engine, and the aircraft differs from the previous baseline aircraft, as it incorporates changes such as a new standard of flight computers, structural and aerodynamics upgrades, and improved on-board military systems.

Three other Air Force MRTTs are currently in various stages of flight testing or conversion at Airbus, which is also in the process of delivering more MRTTs to Australia, South Korea and France.

The A330 MRTT can carry 111 tons of fuel and 37 tons of cargo in its lower cargo hold in the form of eight military pallets or 27 standard commercial LD3 containers. The Air Force says its MRTT’s interior is configured for 266 passengers, and can be fitted with medical equipment and stretchers for medevac missions.

Airbus added that the MRTT will provide Singapore’s Air Force with greater cargo and passenger transport capabilities, as well as enhance its ability to contribute to international humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, or HADR. Singapore’s KC-135s have supported coalition air assets fighting the Islamic State group in the Middle East, as well as conducted HADR missions in the region.

The increased passenger capacity of the new aircraft will prove useful in supporting Singaporean military training outside of Singapore. Land-scarce Singapore conducts significant amounts of military training overseas, including in Australia where an expanded agreement between the two countries was recently signed that will see the number of Singaporean troops allowed to train in Australia almost double to up to 14,000 annually.

"Bringing Digital Transformation to Airbus: An Interview with Marc Fontaine, Digital Transformation officer - BCG","Wed, 05 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJjZy5jb20vcHVibGljYXRpb25zLzIwMTgvYnJpbmdpbmctZGlnaXRhbC10cmFuc2Zvcm1hdGlvbi1haXJidXMtaW50ZXJ2aWV3LW1hcmMtZm9udGFpbmUtZGlnaXRhbC1vZmZpY2Vy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Executing a digital transformation is challenging for any company, but especially for a manufacturer of products as complex as commercial aircraft. For the past several years, Airbus has been implementing a comprehensive program to digitize its design, supply-chain management, service support, manufacturing, and other functions—as well as to transform its organization and corporate culture.

As digital transformation officer for Airbus, Marc Fontaine has been leading this initiative for more than two years. A former officer in the French navy, Fontaine has served in various executive capacities at Airbus and its predecessor companies—including leading the merger that created the European aerospace consortium—for more than two decades. He has also founded several publishing and software-editing enterprises. Fontaine sat down with Loïc Mesnage, a partner at The Boston Consulting Group and managing director of the firm’s Paris office, to discuss Airbus’s progress with its digital transformation and the goals it aims to achieve.

Hello, Marc. Thanks for being with us today. What does digitization mean to the aerospace and defense industry?

We are designing, over six to ten years, a very complex product—probably the most complex product to be manufactured. And each time you get it wrong, for whatever reason, you have to modify it. And digitization will make a difference of hundreds of billions of dollars in redesign.

I believe that this type of, almost, fire-and-forget approach, when applied in this hugely valuable industry, is a source of vast opportunity if it enables you to close the loop more quickly with regard to the design and the operations of the aircraft.

What are the typical opportunities that you've seen?

Typically the opportunities involve re-creating digital continuity. When you look at the data across the supply chain and down to the operations level for each aircraft, you start to visualize larger patterns that you can fix much more easily than if you address discrete issues in piecemeal fashion. Otherwise, the silos of the industry prevent you from seeing these patterns.

For example, in our factories, merging the data of 14 SAP systems allowed us to reduce nonquality on the ramp-up by up to 30%. By interacting with airlines and by merging data from the aircraft in operation together with our knowledge in customer support and services, and with Airbus’s engineering database, we reduced the time required to fix fuel pumps on an A380—what we call “time to get a fix”—from 24 months to two weeks.

The steps we’ve taken toward data integration and data utilization have already begun unleashing incredible potential. On top of that, you have the potential to add intelligence through analytics and machine learning, to help people focus on doing their jobs and applying their knowledge, rather than spending much of their time simply gathering information.

How did you get started on this journey?

Probably the starting point was a series of exploratory visits in Silicon Valley. We were also affected by new entrants, like SpaceX in the space business and in UAVs. Not because we were always engaged in direct competition, but because the new entrants were starting to enter a new dimension. The range of cost was absolutely staggering, and the innovation potential of these companies was very impressive. Also, the introduction of complex innovations close to our business led us to question our own methodologies.

What, in your opinion, has been Airbus’s most amazing accomplishment in digital?

Understanding the power of data integration led us to build a data lake for Airbus. And now, for the industry, we have the Skywise platform, where we convinced ourselves through pragmatic, use-case-driven implementation that the technology was ready for us to leverage the incredible amount of data that we have—in our factories and engineering departments, and in service aircraft, and on board the aircraft, and in the supply chain—to resolve use cases.

Convincing ourselves that the data lake was possible—that it was secure and governable, and that we could even share it with other parties—was a true revolution. For us, as a big company, it was also the answer to a deep contradiction that we've been trying to resolve for decades, which is how to be big and nimble, how to empower teams without relinquishing control.

The fact that people can act at the proper level, concurrently rather than sequentially, in using the same data—the same proof point—across functions and across the business boundaries of the company with suppliers and customers has proved to be the crucial factor in curing the plague of silos between engineering, manufacturing engineering, manufacturing services, customers, and suppliers. So the biggest achievement for us was deploying that approach internally and now deploying it to customers with Skywise and backward to suppliers—an effort that is currently in the evaluation phase.

Are you exploring other technologies in your digital transformation?

Yes, we currently have nine roadmaps of digital capabilities that we are sourcing, partnering, and prototyping in our business for implementation and industrialization. These range from IoT [Internet of Things] to virtual IoT to competence in the Industry 4.0 revolution around cobots, robots, and additive manufacturing.

You must have faced some roadblocks along the way. What were the biggest ones?

The first challenge, I believe, related to conveying the necessary sense of urgency and to doing the evangelizing associated with it. Until people see how digital transformation relates to their own issues and circumstances, they are hard to convince.

Another big challenge is value measurement. In digital transformation, we tackle and improve the business in ways that traditional finance mechanisms cannot fully evaluate, especially in asset-based companies with traditional metrics for return on investment.

How has digital changed Airbus and Airbus people?

Digital transformation is about data, mostly—and humans. We should not forget the transformation part of digital transformation. Seventy-five percent of the effort is probably on the human part of the transformation. It’s not about tool deployment. Tool deployment will not change the way a company operates if you don't also change the processes, the ways of working, the culture, and all of the underlying support-function measurements, values, and metrics.

I believe that digital changes the lives of the people who are exposed to it—again, not because we give them a new tool, but because it enriches their jobs. It gives them more power, it gives them more decision-making power, and it helps them avoid the frustration of being only one gear in a very complex command-and-control mechanism.

How do you see Airbus in five years?

I don't see it precisely, and I truly think this is a good answer. There are some things about it, of course, that are visible. I will implement the digital workplace and Industry 4.0 on the shop floor. We have clear targets about digital design and manufacturing deployment and new ways of working. At the same time, even in aerospace, with Skywise especially, we are starting to see improvements. Thanks to digital, we are piloting potentially new business models, where we are starting to talk about a platform for aerospace, and where we are already talking about third-party developers and APIs [application programming interfaces] for open ecosystems. We’re starting to sound very techy and very software.

So I really believe it's leading to far greater efficiency at an industrial scale of several billion dollars. Each time we have applied these technologies, we have been looking for two-digit improvement—nothing less—so we have to choose the right fights. But the reward is there.

Marc, thank you very much.

Thank you, Loïc."
"State of Alabama, Airbus break ground for Flight Works Alabama - Airbus","Wed, 12 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wOS1zdGF0ZS1vZi1hbGFiYW1hLWFpcmJ1cy1icmVhay1ncm91bmQtZm9yLWZsaWdodC13b3Jrcy1hbGFiYW1h0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New aviation experience center in Mobile due to open in 2019

Alabama Governor Kay Ivey on Wednesday joined Airbus executives, city and county leaders from Mobile, and industry and educational partners in breaking ground for Flight Works Alabama, the new aviation experience center to be built in Mobile.



In May 2017, Ivey announced plans to build the hands-on instructional facility, with the goal to bolster Alabama’s workforce development efforts and inspire young people to pursue careers in aerospace. Wednesday’s event officially launched construction of the facility, which is due to open in late 2019.

During the ceremony, Jeff Knittel, Airbus Americas Chairman and CEO, said, “Success for Airbus, and any company, means we can’t just look at what we’re doing now; we need to look at what we need later—whether it be next year, next decade, or the next five decades. What Airbus and other companies in our industry need to be successful in the future is a skilled, knowledgeable workforce that is ready for that future. Flight Works will help us create that workforce in a fun, creative way.”

“Aerospace is a premier industry, filled with innovative developments and high demand jobs, which are sought after by every state,” Ivey said. “Flight Works Alabama will become a hub to explore the opportunities of this industry. As our state continues to grow this sector, we must show Alabamians all that the aerospace industry can offer them, today and in the years ahead.”

Flight Works Alabama will be an 18,000-square-foot experience center housing a large interactive exhibition area, classrooms, a collaboration room, a workshop, a restaurant and a gift shop. Located near the campus of Airbus’ aircraft manufacturing facility at the Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley, the center will also be a gateway for public tours of Airbus’ A320 family assembly line.

In addition to the experience center, the facility will host educational opportunities for adults seeking new or expanded skills in the industry. Nine education partners have signed on to provide these opportunities including Auburn University, Bishop State Community College, Coastal Alabama Community College, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Troy University, Tuskegee University, University of South Alabama, University of Alabama and University of West Alabama.

Industry and community sponsors for the project were also named at the ceremony, including the Airbus Foundation, Alabama Power Foundation, Conde Systems, the Mobile County Commission, Mott MacDonald, Hoar Program Management, Johnson Controls, Mech-Net, Pratt & Whitney, Safran and Snap-On. Airbus said other sponsorships are in development.

Ultra Long Range A350 XWB goes the distance - Airbus,"Sat, 22 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE4LTA5LXVsdHJhLWxvbmctcmFuZ2UtYTM1MC14d2ItZ29lcy10aGUtZGlzdGFuY2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus’ handover of the first A350-900 Ultra Long Range (ULR) opens a new frontier in non-stop air travel

With the delivery of the first A350-900ULR to launch customer Singapore Airlines (SIA), the A350 XWB Family is positioned to lead the way for new ultra-long-range operations, including on the world’s longest commercial route, between Singapore and New York.

Airlines already use the A350-900 and A350-1000 primarily for long-distance flights, but there is also demand for non-stop services on extreme long-haul missions, which is why Airbus developed its new game-changing variant.

The A350-900ULR – derived from the A350-900 – has an extended range of up to 9,700 nautical miles. This was achieved by integrating a modified fuel system, which increases the aircraft’s fuel carrying capacity by 24,000 litres without the need for additional fuel tanks.

With a maximum take-off weight (MTOW) of 280 tonnes, the A350-900ULR is capable of flying over 20 hours non-stop, combining the highest levels of passenger and crew comfort with unbeatable economics for such distances.

Setting new standards for long-haul travel

Since entering service in 2016, the A350 XWB Family has set new standards for long-haul travel in the mid-size category. Based on a clean sheet design, it has brought a step change in efficiency, reduced fuel consumption and lower cash operating costs compared to the older-generation aircraft it replaces. And in service both the A350-900 and A350-1000 are demonstrating high levels of operational reliability and maturity. The A350 XWB’s flexibility also means the A350-900ULR can easily be reconfigured as a standard -900, if required.

Evolving the ULR from the A350-900 was made possible thanks to extensive design and upstream industrial studies at Airbus, avoiding complex modifications. Some of the engineering development, for example, involved the relocation of sensors in the fuel system – enabling existing tanks to carry the maximum fuel load for the ULR. This eliminated the need for additional fuel tanks."
Forward to the Moon: Airbus wins ESA studies for future human base in lunar orbit - Airbus,"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wOS1mb3J3YXJkLXRvLXRoZS1tb29uLWFpcmJ1cy13aW5zLWVzYS1zdHVkaWVzLWZvci1mdXR1cmUtaHVtYW4tYmFzZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Gateway to serve as a staging point and hub for human missions to the Moon or Mars

Habitat and Esprit module concepts to be presented at the IAC 2018

Bremen, 20 September 2018 – The European Space Agency (ESA) has commissioned Airbus for two studies for possible European involvement in the future human base in lunar orbit. The Gateway, previously known as the Deep Space Gateway (DSG) or Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway (LOP-G), is a project involving the US, Russian, Canadian, Japanese and European space agencies (NASA, Roscosmos, CSA, JAXA and ESA).



Over the next 15 months, Airbus will develop a concept for a habitation and research module as part of the first study (habitat, approximately 6.5 x 4.5 metres and weighing some 9 tonnes). In the second study, Airbus will design a concept for an infrastructure element for refuelling, docking and telecommunications, which will also serve as an airlock for scientific equipment (known as Esprit, around 3 x 3 metres and weighing around 4 tonnes). Both studies will be developed as part of a far-reaching European partnership.

Under NASA's overall design leadership, other elements – such as a second habitat, an airlock for scientific payloads and a logistics module - will be designed by international and commercial partners. NASA has plans to launch the first module - the central power propulsion element (PPE) – into lunar orbit in the early 2020's.

“The experience and know-how that ESA and Airbus have gained during flagship projects such as the Columbus space laboratory, the ATV space transporter and the European service module for Orion provide solid foundations for the studies,” said Oliver Juckenhöfel, Head of On-Orbit Services and Exploration at Airbus. “When developing the new lunar platforms, robotic and human space exploration go hand in hand. Europe has a fantastic track record in both, and these two studies will help to ensure a strong European presence in future space exploration.”

David Parker, Director of Human and Robotic Exploration at ESA, said: ""With these studies and other preparations, ESA aims to stay at the centre of human space exploration. The Gateway will become humanity's most remote research outpost and we hope Europe will benefit from the world of innovation, discovery and excitement that lies ahead.""

Unlike the International Space Station (ISS), the Gateway is not intended to be continually inhabited. It is envisaged that the lunar platform will act as a staging point for human missions to the Moon or Mars, and testing is planned for a series of technologies and procedures that will be needed.

Airbus will present its initial designs for the Gateway at the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) in Bremen on 3 October 2018.

High-flying Airbus technology comes down to Earth for use on ships - Airbus,"Tue, 04 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE4LTA5LWhpZ2gtZmx5aW5nLWFpcmJ1cy10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWNvbWVzLWRvd24tdG8tZWFydGgtZm9yLXVzZS1vbi1zaGlwc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

The company’s own transport vessels will be equipped with automated towing kites from an Airbus start-up

Airbus’ slogan, “We make it fly,” has taken an entirely new meaning with the application of its aeronautical expertise for an innovation that could revolutionize the maritime transport industry.

The SeaWing automated kite, which employs parafoil technology to tow large commercial ships, was developed by a team of environmentally-engaged Airbus engineers. By using the kite to help propel large vessels, SeaWing is expected to provide a 20 percent improvement in fuel economy while also reducing emissions.

When mounted on a vessel, SeaWing can be launched by the simple activation of a switch. The kite deploys, unfurls and operates autonomously; with its system collecting and analysing meteorological and oceanic data in real-time to optimise performance while ensuring maximum safety. When the towing effect is no longer required, SeaWing automatically refolds and is recovered – ready for its next utilisation.

SeaWing was developed by AirSeas, a small Airbus startup that brings together environmentally-engaged company engineers with a common passion for aeronautics and the sea. AirSeas combines maritime expertise with the best Airbus has to offer in terms of aerodynamics, modelling, flight controls, systems and materials.

The SeaWing concept has now come full circle – as Airbus has ordered the kite for use on the company’s own roll-on/roll-off (ro-ro) ships that transport large aircraft parts among its production sites in Europe and to the U.S. In addition to lowering shipping costs by the targeted 20 percent, SeaWing is expected to reduce Airbus’ overall industrial environmental footprint by 8,000 tons of CO2 per year.

“We are very proud that Airbus has confirmed its confidence in the SeaWing system after seeing our test results first-hand on their own ship,” explained CEO and founder Vincent Bernatets, who previously worked at Airbus in managerial, marketing, after-sales and business development positions. “This first ro-ro vessel installation opens the way for further pioneering deals on container ships, bulk freighters and ferries.”

SeaWing has been designed for a rapid integration on almost all commercial ships in operation today, with its simple and modular nature enabling the installation during a regular stopover at a port of call."
Strong as a spider's web - Airbus,"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE4LTA5LXN0cm9uZy1hcy1hLXNwaWRlcnMtd2Vi0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Incredibly strong, lightweight and flexible, spider silk is a true natural wonder – that can now be recreated for industrial use. Together with leading biotech company AMSilk, Airbus aims to use artificial spider silk to create an entirely new generation of composite material that could revolutionise aerospace design.

Spider silk is one of nature’s most astonishing materials. Stronger than steel, tougher than Kevlar and incredibly lightweight, a spider web made from fibres as thick as a pencil would be able to catch a fully loaded A350 – around 200 tonnes. For decades, scientists have sought to recreate spider silk’s astonishing properties for industrial use. But those efforts have been unsuccessful – until now.

Creating a flexible web, strong as steel

AMSilk, a leading biotech company located near Munich, is the world’s first industrial supplier of what it calls synthetic silk biopolymers – artificial spider silk. The company already uses this high-performance, fully biodegradable material for medical devices and cosmetics. As a coating for implants it is more easily accepted by the human body, while silk additives give beauty products their glow. In 2016, it even made a prototype shoe with a major sports clothing label. But now, together with Airbus, it wants to transfer its ground-breaking technology to aerospace.

To do this, Airbus and AMSilk will work together on creating an entirely new area of composite materials. Leading the cooperation for Airbus is Detlev Konigorski, Innovation Manager for Emerging Technologies and Concepts. “Currently, AMSilk produces silk on a metric tonnes scale per annum. But this isn’t yet aerospace-ready. You could compare it to steel: what you use to make cars isn’t the same as what you use to make battleships. We’re looking for the battleship steel version of spider silk.”

After first decoding spider DNA, AMSilk realised that by taking the animal’s specific genetic code for producing silk and introducing it to bacteria, they could artificially reproduce an identical material. The company now carries out this process in 60,000 litre tanks four storeys high, which are filled with water and heated to 37 °C to grow the bacteria. The end result is a powder that can be formed into a fibre, film or gel.

We haven’t even begun to scratch the surface here. Ultimately, this material could enable us to approach design and construction in an entirely new fashion.

- Detlev Konigorski, Airbus Innovation Manager for Emerging Technologies and Concepts

A faster, safer and healthier flight?

So, how can Airbus use the artificial spider silk? “Quite simply, we need to experiment,” says Konigorski.

Greater use of carbon fibre composites has helped reduce aircraft weight, and therefore fuel consumption, in recent years. But AMSilk’s Biosteel® fibers have superior flexibility and shock resistance capabilities.

""It bends without losing strength. So, it could be integrated on parts away from the fuselage that are prone to debris impact or bird strikes. It could help protect space equipment in a similar manner or be applied to defence products. The silk also has remarkable antibacterial properties, so we might be able to integrate it inside an aircraft cabin as a more hygienic material.""

Airbus and AMSilk aim to launch a prototype composite in 2019. This means exploring how the silk reacts when it is introduced into the resin matrixes used to manufacture carbon fibre reinforced polymers, before baking it in an autoclave.

Nature’s revolutionary best

The chance to work with an entirely new material opens up a wealth of exciting possibilities, says Konigorski. “The majority of ingredients for the materials we use are well established; the table of elements is finite. Of course, we’ve used natural materials like wood and bamboo for centuries, but we cannot really influence the material.”

Bioengineering is truly revolutionary. AMSilk can recreate the building blocks of spider silk and influence it to create materials that wouldn’t naturally be that way. ""We haven’t even begun to scratch the surface here. Ultimately, this material could enable us to approach design and construction in an entirely new fashion.""

It bends without losing strength. So, it could be integrated on parts away from the fuselage that are prone to debris impact or bird strikes. It could help protect space equipment in a similar manner or be applied to defence products.

Network for the Sky: Airbus successfully tests stratospheric 4G/5G defence communications with balloon demonstration - Airbus,"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wOS1uZXR3b3JrLWZvci10aGUtc2t5LWFpcmJ1cy1zdWNjZXNzZnVsbHktdGVzdHMtc3RyYXRvc3BoZXJpYy00ZzVn0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"@AirbusDefence

Paris, 25 September 2018 – Airbus has successfully tested stratospheric 4G/5G defence applications with a high-altitude balloon demonstration. The technology tested, an Airbus LTE AirNode, represents a key part of Airbus’ secure networked airborne military communications project, Network for the Sky (NFTS). With this new generation of long-range communications in the sky, high-altitude platforms such as Airbus’ Zephyr will be able to create persistent, secured communication cells to relay information on a variety of different aircraft platforms including helicopters, tactical UAVs and MALE UAVs (Medium Altitude Long Endurance Unmanned Aerial Vehicles).

With the support of French and Canadian space agencies, Airbus flew and tested the communications solution in Canada at all altitudes up to 21km above the Earth’s surface, using a stratospheric balloon to create a high-altitude airborne cell site. In its payload, the balloon carried an Airbus LTE AirNode, which provided a 30km-wide footprint of coverage for private and secure communications. The Airbus team, equipped with two vehicles and two drones, tracked the balloon over 200km, exchanging 4K video between the different assets – simulating an ISR mission with real-time transmission. The data was sent via a private network at speeds from 0.5 to 4 Mbps, which is comparable to 4G/5G mobile communication.

Pushing the boundaries in delivering easily deployable communications, this capability will significantly increase operational flexibility during air missions. An LTE AirNode allows opportunistic, secure communications between different aircraft as they fly within range of each other, where operations require permanent and powerful connectivity. It will deliver highly secure communications for airborne assets, ground or maritime-based operations for several weeks or months at a time – combining the persistence of a satellite with the flexibility of a UAV. This type of ad-hoc network can be adaptable to all users – from special forces to disaster relief scenarios.

Airbus unveiled its NFTS solution at the Farnborough International Airshow 2018. It combines different communication technologies to form one resilient global mesh network, allowing aircraft to be a fully integrated part of a high-speed connected battle space.

Today, individual aircraft, UAVs and helicopters continue to operate on separate networks with limited bandwidth and interoperability, and often little resilience. NFTS will integrate various technologies, such as satellite links with geostationary, medium and low Earth orbit constellations, tactical air-to-ground, ground-to-air and air-to-air links, voice links, 5G mobile communication cells and laser connections, into a single global secure network.

Network for the Sky is the foundation for the connected airborne battlespace, with the objective to offer a full operational capability by 2020. The NFTS programme is part of Airbus’ Future Air Power project and is fully aligned with the development of the European Future Combat Air System (FCAS).

With its Blueprint for the Sky, Airbus outlines a roadmap for the integration of autonomous aircraft and welcome a new era of aviation – safely, efficiently and fairly.

Our skies are busier than ever. And with commercial air traffic set to double in the next 15 years, they will only get busier. In the near future, there will be 25,000 manned flights in the air at any given time. They will soon be joined by an entirely new type of aviation: unmanned, autonomous aircraft.

Already, Airbus is testing small cargo drones and self-piloting electrical vehicles to transport goods and people faster and more efficiently. This is the beginning of a new era in aviation, an exciting time that promises huge opportunities. But it also brings risks that need to be addressed now. Safety is a fundamental rule in aerospace and new forms of flight require new traffic management systems to safely accommodate this opportunity.

This blueprint is a roadmap for collaboration and cooperation that puts safety on an equal footing with technological advancement. It supports policies and rulemaking that can regulate autonomous operations to ensure that air transport remains as safe tomorrow as it is today.

- Tom Enders, Airbus CEO

How to integrate autonomous aircraft

To address the issue, an unmanned traffic management (UTM) project dubbed Altiscope has released Blueprint for the Sky: The Roadmap for the Safe Integration of Autonomous Aircraft. “Airbus has always been on the forefront of innovation in the skies, from our origins among Europe’s aerospace pioneers, through jet age creations such as the Concorde and the Airbus A380,” says Tom Enders, Airbus CEO. ""This blueprint is a roadmap for collaboration and cooperation that puts safety on an equal footing with technological advancement. It supports policies and rulemaking that can regulate autonomous operations to ensure that air transport remains as safe tomorrow as it is today.""

The Blueprint was reviewed by a number of independent parties, including representatives from IATA, NATCA, GUTMA, the World Economic Forum and the New Zealand Ministry of Transport. It outlines a range of topics for a new age of flight, from stakeholder roles to air traffic configuration and system architecture.

Collaboration is key

Above all, it emphasises a need for all parties to work together. Governments and industry professionals around the world have already initiated efforts to address the topic. While these efforts are highly individualised, with each region using different terminology and structure, their architectures, underlying principles to UTM and overall approaches are actually very similar. Each one consists of systems run by regulatory authorities, independent service providers, data providers, operators and aircraft. This step is positive, but it is necessary to unify and harmonise these systems to ensure all vehicles and technology built for one region will be interoperable across regions.

Autonomous flight will change our skies. Tomorrow’s airports will be all around us – in our homes, our workplaces or on the roofs of buildings. Blueprint outlines the information, rules and procedures needed to realise this vision and enable a new revolution in aviation – safely, efficiently and fairly."

When Frank Chapman took A350 XWB-series test aircraft through their paces during an extensive certification campaign, he was representing hundreds of fellow Airbus employees who put their all into this game-changing next-generation widebody jetliner.

Airbus experimental test pilots – counting Chapman among their ranks, who joined Airbus after serving with UK Royal Air Force and Monarch Airlines – are involved from the beginning of a new development programme, using their expertise for the design, including cockpit layouts and controls, as well as aircraft flying qualities.

“Once we enter the flying phase, we need to check the handling and operational characteristics, and eventually make sure the airplane is safe and fit for its purpose – i.e. carrying passengers,” said Chapman, who was deeply involved in A350 XWB development as a project test pilot. “This process takes between a year and 18 months, depending on the nature of the programme.”

Reflection and advice

Chapman says the job’s most satisfying aspect is being a member of a dynamic engineering team, beginning with the design phase and continuing until entry in service.

Based on his career, Chapman offered some advice for those considering a future in aviation. “It is a great field in which to be involved, covering such diverse activity as design, development, engineering and air traffic control…along with flying, of course. But keep your mind open to all the possibilities that are out there. Don't discount anything,” he said.

Chapman has worked at Airbus since 2004. Before joining the company, he had served in the Royal Air Force. Having graduated with a Master’s in Engineering Science from St Catherine's College, Oxford, he went on to complete his test pilot training in France.

In the decade since Airbus inaugurated its Final Assembly Line at Tianjin, China, over 380 jetliners from the best-selling A320 Family have been delivered from the site to both Chinese and international airline customers.

This facility – the first Final Assembly Line outside of Airbus’ European home territory – has achieved its purposes: meeting the demand of a dynamic air transportation market and expanding the global footprint to support the company’s industrial network.

The first Tianjin-assembled A320 Family aircraft was delivered in 2009. Since then, the production output has increased, reaching a forecasted rate of six single-aisle jetliners monthly by the end of 2019. This production increase is associated with consistent, predictable performance, supporting on-time and on-quality manufacturing and deliveries.

“The Tianjin Final Assembly Line was a strategic decision that took courage and innovation to implement,” said George Xu, the CEO of Airbus China. “With the momentum of China's aviation market, it has become a model for Sino-European cooperation – opening new opportunities for our business development in China, as well as creating a solid foundation for the internationalisation of Tianjin and China's aviation industry.”

Created in a joint venture with the Tianjin Free Trade Zone and China Aviation Industry Corporation, the Tianjin A320 Family’s Final Assembly Line now has more than 730 employees, and was expanded to the widebody jetliner segment with Airbus’ Completion and Delivery Centre for A330s. As with the Final Assembly Line, the A330 completion and delivery centre was the first of its kind for Airbus outside of Europe.

The initial A330 was delivered from Tianjin in September 2017, with seven aircraft provided so far to customers who are extremely satisfied in terms of both the cabin interior installation and the quality of fuselage painting.

To date, A330 and A320 Family aircraft have been provided from Tianjin to such carriers as Sichuan Airlines, Beijing Capital Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, Loongair, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Air China and Air Asia.

Tianjin is one of four global locations for assembly of A320 Family jetliners, joining the other Airbus sites in Toulouse, France; Hamburg, Germany; and Mobile in the U.S. state of Alabama."

Nicolas Chamussy, Airbus Defence and Space’s executive vice president of space systems, said his company has assembled a “very accurate database” of orbiting satellites that will need to be replaced by 2025. Satellite operators doing the minimum of replacing ageing spacecraft combined with those pursuing new growth opportunities should place the annual average “in the range of 15 to 18 per year” over the next few years, Chamussy said Sept. 12 at the World Satellite Business Week conference here.

“It’s not the 20-25 number driven after that we have witnessed in the past years, but it’s still a sizeable number,” he said during a panel discussion.

Geostationary telecom satellites have an average design life of 15 years. Many surpass that by a few years, but eventually run out of fuel and are decommissioned. With satellite life extension ventures still in their infancy, it is unclear how significant an impact they will have on Airbus’ projections. Intelsat and SES, the world’s two largest satellite fleet operators, have ordered satellite-life-extension missions from Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems and Maxar Technologies, respectively.

Other panelists agreed that a return to historical norms was unrealistic, but none offered as rosy a picture as Airbus.

“We will probably stay in a range of between 10 and 15 GEO satellites that are on the accessible market,” said Jean-Loïc Galle, president and CEO of Thales Alenia Space.

Galle estimated the world’s satellite operators will order around 10 commercial GEO satellites this year. That would be up from the seven ordered in 2017.

“It will be a low number,” he said.

With less than four months remaining, 2018 has seen just six normal commercial GEO contracts awarded worldwide. Airbus and Maxar’s SSL have both won two apiece while Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems and Thales Alenia Space have each won one. China Great Wall Industry Corp. has framework agreements, but not firm contracts, for three GEO satellites.

Several manufacturers sought to convince prospective customers that they are committed to weathering the order drought that now threatens to close veteran manufacturer Space Systems Loral’s GEO business.

“GEO is here to stay,” said Chris Johnson, president of Boeing Satellite Systems International. “It’s beachfront property, certainly. Some of the other orbital regimes might be the lake or might be a different beach, but it’s still going to be a really important thing for the overall industry and Boeing is committed to see it through.”

Lisa Callahan, Lockheed Martin’s vice president and general manager of commercial civil space, said the company is insulated from the weak GEO market by its government business. What in the past was viewed as a weakness for Lockheed Martin — not having a significant share of the commercial satellite industry — is now viewed as a strength, and Callahan sought to present it as such.

“Years ago we saw some of this coming and the diversification that we needed to do to be able to ebb and flow in different markets.” she said.

Lockheed Martin has has an average of 18 “GEO-like satellites” moving through its factories every year, she said, with this year being above average at 21 such satellites. Investments in government satellites — NASA and the U.S. Defense Department are large customers — bring technologies that also find use in commercial satellites, she said.

“That is going to help in the commercial market as it returns, and I’m sure it will in the future,” she said.

Satellite manufacturers are all pursuing business building constellations of smaller but more numerous satellites in medium and low Earth orbits. Those satellites and the evolution of more expensive high-throughput GEO satellites have rewritten the script in determining the value of individual satellite orders, executives have said.

SSL and its parent company Maxar Technologies have described smallsats as a growing business opportunity as it shrinks the size of its GEO business. Dario Zamarian, president of SSL, said the GEO market has “reached a new structural low.”

“It is not obvious whether our customers have yet together with us found a magic formula to sustain a resurgence of demand with supply,” he said.

Maxar is in the process of evaluating “strategic alternatives” for SSL’s GEO business, which include a possible exit. The company expects to make a decision by the end of the year.

“Should we partner up with a culturally compatible, financially and technologically compatible company? Should we explore a sales option? We haven’t made any of those decisions just yet, but we are not ashamed of recognizing that the market is not as it used to be,” Zamarian said."
France wants to buy Airbus tankers sooner - Defense News,"Fri, 21 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9nbG9iYWwvZXVyb3BlLzIwMTgvMDkvMjEvZnJhbmNlLXdhbnRzLXRvLWJ1eS1haXJidXMtdGFua2Vycy1zb29uZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — France renewed a pledge to speed up by two years delivery of 12 Airbus A330 multirole transport tanker jets for the French Air Force by 2023.

“At the ministerial investment committee, the Direction Générale de l’Armement received the mission to accelerate the delivery of the A330 MRTT Phénix,” the armed forces ministry said in a Sept. 20 statement.

A 12-strong fleet of the A330 MRTT by 2023 brings forward delivery of the air tankers by two years, the ministry said. A further three units will be ordered to bring the total fleet to 15 in the following years, the ministry added.

No dates were given for a contract for the A330 MRTT or the value of the planned order. No date was set for a further batch of three more units.

That boost for inflight refuelling was among the equipment modernization measures included in the 2019-2025 military budget law, formally signed by French president Emmanuel Macron just before an official garden party on July 13.

The French Air Force has long lobbied for renewing the aerial capability, as the present aging tanker fleet is a key element in the airborne nuclear deterrent. French air operations in allied operations in the sub-Saharan Sahel region and the Middle East rely heavily on U.S. air tankers.

The A330 MRTT will replace a mixed fleet of C-135FR and KC-135R tankers — some of which are close to 60 years old — and A310 and A340 strategic troop and transport aircraft. The A330 MRTT is a military conversion of the Airbus A330 airliner."

The Airbus A380 club is about to get bigger by one airline.

The first “superjumbo jet” bound for Japanese carrier All Nippon Airways (ANA) took to the skies Monday at Airbus’ assembly line facility in Toulouse, France.

The jet’s maiden voyage took it to another Airbus facility in Hamburg, Germany, where the jet is now being readied for cabin installation. It also will be painted in a special sea turtle paint scheme that ANA has planned for the aircraft.

ANA's order for three models of the jet gave Airbus’ struggling A380 program a boost in 2016.The deal also helped Airbus partially salvage an A380 order canceled by bankrupt Japanese carrier Skymark. At the time, Airbus hadn’t landed a new airline customer for the A380 in nearly three years, according to Bloomberg News.

TODAY IN THE SKY: Emirates throws Airbus A380 a lifeline with $16 billion deal

There had been speculation about the long-term future for the A380, though those concerns eased – somewhat – when Emirates announced it would buy 20 more of the plane.

As for ANA, it will become the first Japanese carrier to fly the double-decked A380, the world’s largest commercial passenger aircraft.

Delivery of ANA’s first A380 is scheduled for early 2019, when the airline will deploy the plane on its Tokyo-Honolulu route.

ANA says it will give its first A380 a paint job that will make it look like a giant sea turtle. That “Flying Honu” livery was picked after nearly 2,200 people submitted entries in a paint-the-plane contest that ANA opened to select a unique look for its first A380.

Once ANA takes delivery of the A380, it will become the world’s 15th airline to put the plane into service.

The 14th carrier to fly the jet came earlier this year with little-known European charter carrier HiFly. The Portuguese-based company bought a secondhand Airbus A380 that first flew for Singapore Airlines, which later returned the jet as it took delivery of newer versions.

The A380 now owned by HiFly remains decked out in Singapore’s luxurious cabin configuration, which includes private suites with lie-flat beds in first class. HiFly’s A380s briefly flew between London and New York JFK for budget carrier Norwegian, which needed the jet to stand in for some of its Boeing 787s that were out of service for needed repairs to their Rolls Royce engines.

So far, Airbus says it has delivered 229 A380s.

Airbus Will Use Recombinant Spider Silk to Build Lightweight Planes - Labiotech.eu,"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhYmlvdGVjaC5ldS90cmVuZHMtbmV3cy9haXJidXMtYW1zaWxrLXNwaWRlci1zaWxrLXBsYW5lcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has signed a partnership with German biotech AMSilk for the development of a new biomaterial to be used in the construction of future high-performance planes.

Spider silk is known for having outstanding strength and flexibility. AMSilk uses engineered bacteria to produce spider silk protein, which is then used to create materials with a wide range of applications. Among them is a biodegradable running shoe that the company developed for Adidas.

AMSilk will be working with Airbus in the development of a composite material based on its spider silk fibers that is stronger, lighter and more flexible than the materials currently used to build planes. The team expects to have a prototype material ready in 2019.

“In recent years, the aerospace industry has shifted from metal or steel fuselage and wings to carbon fiber composite materials, mainly to decrease the weight of planes and as a consequence save fuel,” an AMSilk spokesperson told me.

“The new composite material AMSilk and Airbus are developing could be used to develop complex and more flexible structures on the one hand, and to reduce repair costs and plane downtime on the other hand.”

An additional advantage of the new material will be that, as the spider silk fibers are produced using a biotechnological process, their production is more sustainable than that of any other alternatives currently available.

It’s exciting to see yet another industry that could be positively impacted by biomaterials. Textiles, plastics and cosmetics are already starting to be produced using biological processes, and some believe that, in the not so distant future, biotechnology could be as ubiquitous as digital technologies are today.

The acceptance flight followed by JetBlue’s scheduled ferry flight, taking place on September 20, marks JetBlue’s first-ever flights fueled with renewable jet fuel blend. The fuel for these flights, provided by Airbus and certified by Air BP, consists of 15.5 percent renewable jet fuel blended with traditional jet fuel.

Four more A321 aircraft will be delivered to JetBlue from Airbus’s U.S. facility by the end of 2018. All of these customer acceptance and delivery flights will be fueled with renewable jet fuel. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has approved renewable jet fuel safe for use. Renewable jet fuel is chemically equivalent to conventional jet-A fuel, and poses no difference in performance or safety. To date, thousands of commercial, revenue flights have flown on different types of renewable jet fuel.

“This is another example of JetBlue acknowledging that a sustainable future for aviation will require cooperation between all parts of the industry,” said Robin Hayes, Chief Executive Officer, JetBlue. “Renewable jet fuel affirms JetBlue’s belief that we can help define our industry’s future path. Our goal is to serve as a market-maker for renewable jet fuel, creating demand and therefore supporting supply. We’re working closely with Airbus to set up infrastructure for more options in the southeast region.”

Following the deliveries in the U.S. to JetBlue, Airbus will determine the next steps toward offering this option to more customers taking aircraft deliveries from Mobile. Longer term, Airbus envisions supporting industrial production of sustainable fuels for aviation in the U.S. In another commitment to sustainability throughout the aircraft’s lifecycle, Airbus also announced its U.S. Manufacturing Facility in Mobile officially received its ISO 14001 certification. Airbus was the first aircraft manufacturer to be certified ISO 14001 for all its sites, products and services.

“Our goal is to source sustainable fuels in the southeastern United States. It is an opportunity to work closely with local stakeholders to scale-up production and the commercialization of sustainable aviation fuels in the region,” said Frederic Eychenne, Head of New Energies at Airbus. “We are actively seeking ideas to leverage Airbus’ strategy into opportunities for new economic development in Alabama.”

JetBlue is proactive about mitigating the impact of changes in the fuel market by flying more efficient aircraft, optimizing its fuel consumption, moving to renewable jet fuel, and more. With an aviation industry-wide goal to cap net greenhouse gas growth from 2020 onward, renewable jet fuel is a key aspect of JetBlue’s emissions reduction strategy. In 2016, JetBlue signed a deal and made an offtake agreement with SJ Preston for renewable jet fuel at New York’s JFK Airport.

JetBlue’s Focus on the Environment - JetBlue depends on natural resources and a healthy environment to keep its business running smoothly. The airline is committed to taking steps to address the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from its flights and empowers and inspires its customers and crewmembers to offset GHG emissions when they fly.

Alexander Gerst to install ESA´s new technology demonstrator on the ISS

Friedrichshafen, 05/09/2018 – Airbus is sending a new Life Support Rack to the International Space Station (ISS). The rack also known as Advanced Closed Loop System (ACLS) has been developed by Airbus for the European Space Agency (ESA) as a technology demonstrator, which will purify air and produce oxygen for the ISS.



The Life Support Rack is stored in the pressurized part of the Japanese HTV-7, an unmanned cargo spacecraft to resupply the ISS, which is currently set to launch from Tanegashima Space Center on 11 September 2018. It will be installed into the Destiny Module (US Laboratory) by ESA astronaut and ISS commander Alexander Gerst on 2 November 2018. Its technology is a critical step forward towards a closed loop life support system, necessary for human spaceflight beyond low Earth orbit.



The air in the ISS has around 0.4% of carbon dioxide content, which is about 10 times higher than on Earth. ACLS will provide additional capacity to the existing ISS life support system to remove carbon dioxide from the cabin air. This is performed by two components: CO 2 adsorption using Astrine (a solid amine resin), and use of a Sabatier reactor (using hydrogen to convert carbon dioxide into methane and water).



The third component of ESA´s new Rack is its electrolyser, which produces oxygen and hydrogen from water. The oxygen produced is used to replenish the cabin air, and the hydrogen is consumed by the Sabatier reactor.



A newly formed ACLS operations team (OPS), based at Airbus in Friedrichshafen, Germany, will operate the ACLS throughout its mission. ACLS OPS is part of the ISS’s ground network, and works directly with the ESA Columbus Control Center in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany.



Following installation, the ACLS OPS team will commence a six week commissioning phase to check the new facility. Successful commissioning will be followed by operations on the ISS until the end of 2019, with the ACLS providing additional carbon dioxide removal and oxygen generation capabilities to the astronauts onboard.

Defective rotor parts from Airbus blamed for fatal South Korean helicopter crash - Defense News,"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbnNlbmV3cy5jb20vZ2xvYmFsL2FzaWEtcGFjaWZpYy8yMDE4LzA5LzEyL2RlZmVjdGl2ZS1yb3Rvci1wYXJ0cy1mcm9tLWFpcmJ1cy1ibGFtZWQtZm9yLWZhdGFsLXNvdXRoLWtvcmVhbi1oZWxpY29wdGVyLWNyYXNoL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SEOUL — An interim report from a joint investigation into a fatal crash of a South Korean Marine Corps helicopter indicates that defects in the main rotor mast likely caused the accident, according to military sources.

The crash of a Marineon, a modified variant of the Surion KUH-1 utility helicopter, occurred July 17 during a test flight at an airfield in the southeastern port city of Pohang. The crash killed five troops. Closed-circuit video footage showed the rotor blades fell apart shortly after takeoff.

The rotor mast in question was supplied by Airbus Helicopters, but manufactured by an Airbus contractor, according to investigators. Airbus is the main partner of the Surion development with Korea Aerospace Industries under a 2006 deal.

The joint investigation team, which involves civilian and military experts as well as observers, was launched Aug. 8 to find the cause of the accident. Airbus officials are participating in the probe.

“The interim results will be reported to the Ministry of National Defense this week before announcing them by Sept. 17,” a Marine Corps spokesman said. “Investigators have tentatively concluded that cracks in the rotor mast of the Marineon was a main cause of the crash.”

A member of the investigation team told Defense News that his team had found defects in a set of three rotor masts imported from Airbus during parts inspections.

“We found that the strength of a set of three rotor masts imported from Airbus was far lower than the standard, and one of them were confirmed to have been fitted in the crashed Marineon,” the investigator said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Two other rotor masts in question were fitted in two other Surion troop-carrying helicopter[s] flown by the Army.”

The investigator said Airbus officials have confirmed the defects in the rotor masts.

“As a key supplier, Airbus Helicopter[s] is providing both the manufacturer KAI and the (Korean) authorities every assistance required on this investigation,” Belinda Ng, head of external communications in the Asia-Pacific region, said in a statement. “Although the company cannot respond to ongoing speculation in the media ahead of the preliminary report, there is currently no requirement for follow-up safety actions on any aircraft in our global fleet.”

About 90 Surion helicopters of the South Korean Army have been grounded since the accident. Other civilian Surion variants also stopped flight missions.

“We’ll keep cooperating to establish the cause of the accident and take proper actions to respond to the results,” a Korea Aerospace Industries spokesman said.

The KAI spokesman said the discussion of exporting Surion helos to the Philippines could restart on the occasion of the third Asian Defence, Security and Crisis Management Exhibition and Conference to be held in Manila from Sept. 26-28.

Before the accident, KAI raised hopes for exporting the Surion for the first time, as the Philippines was looking to buy the helicopter as part of efforts to modernize its armed forces.

During his visit to Seoul in June, President Rodrigo Duterte requested South Korean authorities display the Surion so he could board and examine the rotorcraft. Dutere showed interest in purchasing Surion helicopters particularly after his government canceled a deal to acquire 16 Bell 412EPI helicopters from Canada.

Pundits, however, believe it could take time for KAI to rebuild its credibility on Surion’s safety in the wake of the accident.

“KAI is not free from its accountability for quality control of products, even if an Airbus contractor is found guilty for delivering defective parts,” said Shin Jong-woo, a senior analyst at the Korea Defense Security Forum, a Seoul-based think tank. “Investigators may have to look into other possible causes of the accident to prevent recurrence of accidents.”

Said Ahn Young-soo, a researcher at the state-funded Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade: “It’s going to take some time to rebuild Surion’s credibility after the fatal crash, but once the cause of the accident was discovered without critical problems with the aircraft design and others, export bids could restart.”

South Korea chose Airbus Helicopters for a new light helicopter development project in 2015. Under the $1.4 billion agreement, South Korea would develop a lightweight helicopter with a gross weight of about 4.5 metric tons for both civil and military purposes.

According to the agreement, the helicopter would be designed on the basis of the Airbus H155, a wide-cabin derivative of the 1970s-era AS365 Dauphin. The civilian variant would be developed by 2020 and the military version by 2022, with the aim of supplying about 400 units domestically and exporting some 600 units.

Canberra, 27 September 2018 - Airbus and the Australian Space Agency (ASA) have signed a statement of intent confirming the European manufacturer’s commitment towards enhancing the capability and competitiveness of the country’s space sector.

The statement of intent, which is the first to be signed by the agency with an industry partner, includes Airbus’ support for space discovery, technology development and connectivity, and Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education in Australia.

Pierre Jaffre, President Asia-Pacific Airbus said: “Airbus aims to support projects and partnerships that contribute to growth and jobs in Australia, with a special focus on innovation and skills. We look forward to working with the Australian Space Agency, as well as the country’s academia, SMEs and start-ups, to develop Australia’s space sovereign capability. This includes nurturing and developing areas of strategic priority and technologies identified by an expert reference group panel.”

Dr Megan Clark AC, Head of the Australian Space Agency, said: “The Australian Space Agency is committed to a transparent and significant engagement with industry. Our purpose is to transform and grow the Australian space sector, and the broader use of space across the country’s economy, to inspire and deliver benefit to all Australians. We welcome Airbus’ choice of Australia for the world’s first operations of the Zephyr and Skynet 5 platforms. We also welcome Airbus’ efforts to actively support STEM education and training opportunities in Australia and internationally.”

Airbus and the Australian Space Agency have a shared interest in enhancing the competitiveness and capability of the Australian space industry. This includes the growing importance of commercialisation at every point along the space value-added chain, from research and development to high-tech manufacturing, transportation, satellite operations and consumer services based on satellite signals and data.

Airbus Defence and Space has a major presence in Australia. In 2011, the Royal Australian Air Force became the launch operator of the A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) which it designates locally as the KC-30A. Airbus has also been supplying earth observation satellite imagery to the Australian market for over 25 years, and the company’s fully integrated optical and radar satellite constellation enables daily acquisitions at high resolutions.

In 2016, a brand new purpose built satellite ground station was established in Adelaide to land Airbus Defence and Space’s Skynet secure military satellite communications. In June 2018, Airbus selected Wyndham airfield in Western Australia as the first flight base for its pioneering Zephyr solar-powered unmanned aircraft.

Airbus’ Space Systems business line designs, develops and operates major space systems around the world. Globally, commercial and institutional customers rely on the company’s leading space and technology solutions. This covers everything from the smallest electronic parts to the full in-orbit delivery of satellites, from very-high-resolution Earth observation instruments to unprecedented deep-space exploration missions, and from today’s most reliable telecommunication satellites to unfailing International Space Station operations.

The Airbus A330neo is Europe's answer to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Like the Dreamliner, it's a ready-made replacement for the aging Boeing 767 and older Airbus models likes the A330ceo and A340. But unlike the Boeing 787, the A330neo has not had the sales success of its US rival with just 224 orders on the books. In comparison, Boeing has taken nearly 1,400 orders for the Dreamliner.

Launched in 2014, the A330neo is a next-generation development of the airframer's long-time workhorse A330ceo wide-body twinjet. However, the A330neo has been beset by delays concerning its Rolls-Royce engines and overshadowed by its flashier carbon composite sibling, the A350XWB.

This fall, the Airbus A330-900neo is finally expected to enter service this fall with launch customer TAP Air Portugal.

So why has Portugal's national airline gone with the A330neo instead of the A350 or Boeing Dreamliner?

According to the TAP's co-owner and serial airline entrepreneur David Neeleman, it came down to the company's familiarity with Airbus, how well the A330neo fit with its route network, and finally price.

""We were already kind of with Airbus so it's harder to make the switch,"" the JetBlue founder told us in a recent interview.

TAP currently operates an all-Airbus fleet headlined by the A320 family and the A330ceo.

""Airbus is really good at cockpit commonality, so when we go to train a pilot between an A320 and an A330, it's a pretty easy step up,"" he added.

That effectively put the Boeing Dreamliner out of contention. But what about the A350?

Related stories

""The A350 is a good airplane, but it's kind of too much airplane for us,"" Neeleman said. ""One of the advantages of the A350 is its range. You can go 16 or 17 hours on and we didn't need that range.""

Many of the A350's customers find the plane's nearly 10,000-mile range to be invaluable for ultra-long-haul routes connecting Asia with Europe and North America. However, TAP's route network is designed to connect Portugal with North America and the country's former colonies. For example, TAP's non-stop service between Lisbon, Portugal, and Sao Paulo, Brazil is one of the airline's bread and butter routes. It's also one of its longest routes at just over 10 hours while covering around 5,000 miles. Thus, the A330-900neo's 8,300 miles range will more than suffice.

And then there's the issue of money.

The A330-900neo lists for $296.4 million while the comparable A350-900 costs $21 million more per plane.

""We actually had an order for 12 A350s, but we needed more airplanes,"" Neeleman said.

According to Neeleman, the A330neo boasted all of the fuel-saving features of the A350, including next-generation engines, new avionics, and optimized aerodynamics, but comes at a much lower price.

""It kind of did everything we needed based on the money we had to spend so we ended up going with the A330neo,"" he said.

In 2015, TAP replaced the A350 order with a deal for 14 A330neos.

The A330neo has netted 224 orders from airlines around the world headlined by Malaysian low-cost carrier AirAsia X as its largest customer with 66 on order. The A330neo's only US airline customer is Delta with 25 orders on the books.

Earlier this year, American Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines both canceled Airbus orders a favor of the Boeing Dreamliner. Hawaiian's defection to the Boeing camp is particularly painful for Airbus because it was the last airline with orders for the smaller variant of the A330neo, the A330-800neo.

Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider

According to Hawaiian Airlines CEO Peter Ingram, the A330neo's lack of sale was one of the reasons why the carrier opted to go with the Boeing.

""Unfortunately, the A330-800 has not proved to be as popular in the marketplace,"" Ingram said in an interview with Business Insider earlier this year. ""But for us, it doesn't make sense to remain committed to an airplane that had the risk of not being sufficiently accepted in the marketplace in the future."""
Airbus Demonstrates Future Manned-Unmanned Vision - Drone Below,"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZHJvbmViZWxvdy5jb20vMjAxOC8wOS8yOC9haXJidXMtZGVtb25zdHJhdGVzLWZ1dHVyZS1tYW5uZWQtdW5tYW5uZWQtdmlzaW9uL9IBVGh0dHBzOi8vZHJvbmViZWxvdy5jb20vMjAxOC8wOS8yOC9haXJidXMtZGVtb25zdHJhdGVzLWZ1dHVyZS1tYW5uZWQtdW5tYW5uZWQtdmlzaW9uLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus' unmanned systems to be controlled from a manned aircraft

0 ( 0 )

Drone are the focal point of technological innovations that are creating the right combination of human and UAV interaction to help take combat techniques to the next level. Manned-unmanned-teaming is expected to increase the mission efficiency of future airborne systems in many ways. A swarm of sensor equipped unmanned systems can provide situational awareness to a mission group commander located a safe distance away aboard the manned aircraft. This manned-unmanned teaming (MUT) has been tested and demonstrated successfully by Airbus in a test zone of Germany’s Baltic Sea area.

Airbus’ vision for future air power is smart, modular and connected air borne systems equipped with the ability to control unmanned systems from a manned aircraft being viewed as a potential and important “force multiplier”.

Advanced flight control and flight management system

A key element contributing to these successful flights was the advanced flight control and flight management system developed by Airbus for unmanned air vehicles – that saw the convergence of fully automatic guidance, navigation and control with intelligent swarming capabilities.

The MUT trial flights served multiple purposes, including validating such elements as connectivity, human-machine interface, and the concept of teaming intelligence through mission group management. For the aspect of teaming intelligence, multiple capabilities and enabling technologies are required at sufficient maturity levels – from teaming/swarming algorithms and new sensors to mission management systems for command and control assistance by the manned aircraft’s crew. A talented, dedicated team of engineers helped make Airbus’ manned-unmanned teaming (MUT) test flight campaigns successful; Sabine Frosh one of the engineers involved in the MUT successful test flight said that, “the team is really great and it’s amazing that everything went off well.”

During manned-unmanned teaming (MUT) test flight campaign this know-how was applied in a dynamic and interactive manner successfully. These campaigns included demonstrations with five Airbus-built Do-DT25 target drones controlled from a mission group commander who was airborne in a manned command and control (C2) aircraft.

The Airbus MUT demonstrations were low cost and brought together several of the company’s in house programme and product lines. Not only were these cost effective main development and test phases conducted during a short timeframe but were also supported by an agile, rapid prototyping environment and a risk-mitigation approach. Expertise gained during the manned-unmanned teaming test flight campaigns will be applied by Airbus to develop Europe’s Future Combat Air System (FCAS).

Airbus increases capacity at Tianjin final assembly line - China Daily,"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaW5hZGFpbHkuY29tLmNuL2EvMjAxODA5LzI1L1dTNWJhOTkyZDZhMzEwYzRjYzc3NWU3ZGU2Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Employees work on the assembly of an Airbus A320 airplane at the company's plant in Tianjin. [Photo/Agencies]

European aircraft manufacturer Airbus SE said it is witnessing the fast and stable growth of China's civil aviation market, and its A320 family final assembly line in Tianjin is increasing its capacity.

Currently, Airbus assembles an average of four-and-a-half A320 aircraft a month in Tianjin, and it will deliver a total of 52 A320s this year. Early next year, it will produce five A320 aircraft a month, and by the end of 2019, it will produce six A320s a month, according to the company.

The production ramp-up follows an agreement between Airbus and China signed during French President Emmanuel Macron's state visit to China in January.

The facility, the third-largest single-aisle assembly line for Airbus after Toulouse and Hamburg, will be in operation for 10 years from this week. By the end of August, it had delivered 378 A320 aircraft to Chinese airlines and Air Asia, and it is looking to attract more customers from Asia.

""We are 100 percent confident of the China market, our largest market, followed by the United States. We are committed to China and bullish on its growth potential. Airbus is looking at bringing in a lot of new ideas every day,"" said Francois Mery, chief operating officer of Airbus Commercial Aircraft China.

Meanwhile, Airbus now also delivers one A330 airplane a month from its A330 completion and delivery center in Tianjin, the company's first widebody completion and delivery center outside Europe and launched in September 2017.

By the end of this year, the manufacturer will deliver 12 widebody aircraft in total from Tianjin to Chinese airlines, including major State-owned and private carriers.

""We also plan to extend the work in Tianjin to A330neo, and we are expected to deliver the first A330neo aircraft by early 2020,"" Mery said.

""Compared to 10 years ago, we are doing more complicated assembly work in Tianjin, and we plan to cooperate with more Chinese suppliers, including suppliers of equipment and systems,"" he said.

By 2020, the total output from the cooperation between Airbus and Chinese firms is expected to reach more than $1 billion. The value was $641 million last year and $120 million in 2008, Airbus said.

""Chinese industrial players are doing more critical manufacturing jobs for global aircraft manufacturers, showing that they have become more skilled and recognized,"" said Lin Zhijie, an aviation industry analyst and columnist at carnoc.com, one of China's biggest civil aviation websites.

""We would like to form a vertical integration supply chain in China, meaning we will purchase raw materials, do the parts assembly, then the aircraft assembly in China. This will help us to save a significant amount of transportation costs and raise the efficiency, and it's also good for China to develop its strength in aviation manufacturing,"" Mery said.

Currently, Airbus takes about half of the market share in China, compared with 9 percent in 1996. Its industrial cooperation with China has helped the company in boosting its market share remarkably against archrival Boeing Co of the United States. Boeing unveiled its first overseas completion and delivery center for its single-aisle aircraft in Zhoushan, Zhejiang province, last year."
Airbus Helicopters focuses on the wind turbine growth market - Airbus,"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wOS1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtZm9jdXNlcy1vbi10aGUtd2luZC10dXJiaW5lLWdyb3d0aC1tYXJrZXTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hamburg, Airbus Helicopters views the support for wind farms as a business segment that is undergoing global growth and expects demand for up to a thousand helicopters over the coming two decades, corresponding to revenues of approximately €9 billion. Airbus Helicopters will present its supply, maintenance and crew transport solutions at the WindEnergy expo, which will be held in Hamburg from 25 to 28 September.

“Helicopters are an integral part of any logistics concept for offshore wind farms,” says Dennis Bernitz, Head of Western Europe Sales. “Our helicopters can complete missions for wind farms in a particularly quick, economical, safe and environmentally friendly manner. Helicopters can be used to deploy technicians or medical personnel in emergencies, even in rough seas, and can also transport operating personnel between the shore and the wind farm.” Helicopter transport means that personnel avoid problems with seasickness caused by travelling by sea in rough weather conditions. The probability of mistakes being made by seasick technicians is considerably higher than in the case of healthy technicians; in severe cases, the error rate climbs dramatically.

With turbine output rising, leading to a higher rate of electricity production, wind farm operators rely on an efficient, rapid-response logistics system, relying on high availability, to keep losses to a minimum should a malfunction occur. At the same time, wind farms are being built further and further from the shore. A helicopter can cover 40 nautical miles (approximately 74 km) in 20 minutes, meaning it can reach the site and return to shore faster than a transport vessel.

Airbus Helicopters has developed a logistics calculator for wind farm operators, which takes into account all relevant factors – weather, location and the number of turbines in the wind farm – to determine the most economical and environmentally friendly logistics solution which includes options on the mix of transport and special-purpose vessels.

Companies do not usually purchase the means of transport themselves, but lease the services from operators. Airbus Helicopters offers the H135, H145 and H175 rotorcraft for crew transport, maintenance and rescue missions. In future, the H160 is also expected to be available to this market. With their two engines and four-axis autopilot, these Airbus helicopters have the ability to hover in the air and safely and precisely winch down personnel or goods to exactly where they are needed.

About Airbus

Airbus is a global leader in aeronautics, space and related services. In 2017 it generated revenues of € 59 billion restated for IFRS 15 and employed a workforce of around 129,000. Airbus offers the most comprehensive range of passenger airliners from 100 to more than 600 seats. Airbus is also a European leader providing tanker, combat, transport and mission aircraft, as well as one of the world’s leading space companies. In helicopters, Airbus provides the most efficient civil and military rotorcraft solutions worldwide."

“OCCAR (Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation) has commissioned Airbus Helicopters, on behalf of the French, German and Spanish armament agencies DGA, BAAINBw and DGAM, to perform de-risking studies aimed at providing the Tiger with next-generation battlefield capabilities,” the company said Sept. 27.

The studies will help in development and retrofit preparation of avionics and mission and weapon systems for the Tiger, the company said. Electronics specialist Thales and missile-builder MBDA will take part in the studies.

“We are proud to be preparing the future of the Tiger as it represents a major program for the European defense cooperation initiative,” said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters.

French Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly said she is trying to persuade her German counterpart to opt for the same missile as France for the Tiger, rather than make its own order for the the Rafael Spike missile.

The de-risking studies may consider various options, such as Spike, Brimstone and MMP missiles, and will note the changes that might be required, such as fitting an antenna for radio data link to deliver pictures to the cockpit right up to impact, an industry executive said.

The French Army is drawing up requirements for a future tactical air-to-surface missile, dubbed MAST-F, which would arm the upgraded Tigers.

Rafael has pitched its extended-range Spike ER2 missile to Germany for the Tiger, hoping Berlin will follow the flight path of Spain, which arms its Tiger helicopters with the Israeli weapon."

Speaking at World Routes 2018 in Guangzhou, China, in a talk on wet leasing, ACMI24 leasing manager Andy Peirce said the A320 was the most popular narrow body aircraft currently for renting.

However, he added all this will change once the new aircraft is in operation.

Peirce said: ""The A321LR will be a game changer and will affect many wide body decisionsas it has the costs of a narrow body but the advantages of a wide body.""

He added the Boeing 737NG was also proving popular in the short-haul sector while the A330-200 was the most poplar in the wide-body market.

The B777-200ER is also growing in popularity, Peirce said, while the A380 has its niche as its use around the world is limited by available runways.

Both the B787 and the A350 are also beginning to enter the market ""a bit earlier than people probably thought,"" Peirce said.

He added Europe was the most popular continent for the practice, which sees the lessor provide the aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance while the lessee is responsible for everything else, with 34 customer airlines and 30 supplier airlines.

However, in other parts of the world, the practice is less prevalent he added, with Asia having only six customer airlines while Africa has four and six supplier airlines.

Peirce argued this is not necessarily an issue as intercontinental leases can be arranged, although he added they often meant filling out a lot more paperwork."

This is according to Pascale Dumarcet, who is perfectly-positioned to compare the two activities: she’s a design office engineer working at Airbus in Toulouse, France; as well as a member of the company-sponsored Ang’elles all-women parachuting team that is earning accolades at style and accuracy competitions around the world.

Five Ang’elles celebrate their bronze medals for “Team Accuracy” and “Overall Female Team” at the 35th FAI (Fédération Aéronautique Internationale) World Freefall Style and Accuracy Landing Championships, held August 2018 in Bulgaria

“The sport has a small margin of error,” said Dumarcet, whose recent activity includes contributions to 3D digitalisation of company’s A330 widebody airliner for use in everything from design, production to in-service maintenance and support. “In our skydiving competitions, to cleanly land at the designated position we must simultaneously manage varying wind velocities, thermals and more while freefalling from an altitude of some 2,200 meters.”

Airbus has sponsored the all-women Ang’elles parachute team, which competes under the aegis of the French Skydiving Federation, since 2016.

Ahead of the competition

Dumarcet – who began parachuting competitively as a youngster and returned to competition three years ago while at Airbus – is one of nine women currently on the Ang’elles team, which competes under the aegis of the French Skydiving Federation. Airbus has sponsored the squad since 2016.

The Ang’elles’ latest successes came at the 35th FAI (Fédération Aéronautique Internationale) World Freefall Style and Accuracy Landing Championships, held late last month in Bulgaria. During the week-long event, Deborah Ferrand earned the gold medal in “Individual Accuracy,” while her teammate Leocadie Ollivier De Pury took silver in the “Individual Style” category.

At such international competitions, the Ang’elles can compete as a five-person team (with members selected by the French Skydiving Federation). During the FAI event in Bulgaria, they also won a pair of bronze medals for “Team Accuracy” and “Overall Female Team.”

Inside the cockpit of an Airbus A220 - CNN,"Fri, 14 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWEyMjAtY29ja3BpdC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gE6aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWEyMjAtY29ja3BpdA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

Ever wondered what all those switches, dials and levers do in the cockpit of an airplane?

We did too, so we asked a pilot.

Gerhard Ramcke, of Latvian airline airBaltic, gave CNN Travel a tour of the flight deck of a brand spanking new Airbus A220-300 as the aircraft was making its debut earlier this year.

The controls of the super-modern aircraft bear little resemblance to the clunky mechanisms found in older planes though – the A220-300 is fully digital.

Its state-of-the-art touchscreens more closely resemble something from a spacecraft than an airplane.

“It’s a full glass cockpit,” says Ramcke, gesturing around the flight deck. “No round dial instruments anymore. All of the data is projected onto these screens.”

The A220’s Flight Management System is a computer system that automates a wide range of inflight tasks.

It can determine the aircraft’s position and, in line with the flight plan, calculate the course the aircraft needs to follow – a very smart autopilot.

Meanwhile, the Flight Control System connects the side-stick, the throttles and the pedals, which the pilot uses to maneuver the craft.

The overhead panel, says Ramcke, “operates all of the systems.”

Change of identity

“If we would go for a takeoff now, we would have made sure that all of the panels are set up accordingly, then we would have set up FMS, then we would have our maps set accordingly,” he explains.

“On the takeoff run itself, we would put the power into a certain position, check that the engine values are stable, and then the autothrottle system would be taking over from there.”

After using the side-stick to rotate the aircraft to the correct pitch value, Ramcke would continue the takeoff.

“And at some point,” he adds, “although I’d love to do the entire flight manually, I would switch the autopilot on.”

While the A220-300 officially debuted at the Farnborough Airshow 2018 in July, it actually entered service several years earlier, under a different brand name.

The A220 series was originally created and sold by Canadian manufacturer Bombardier and was known as the CSeries. The First A220-300s were sold as Bombardier CS300s to Swiss International Air Lines in 2016.

Airbus bought a majority stake in the CSeries in October 2017, leading to the aircraft’s identity switch.

Delta Air Lines, the first US carrier to order the Cseries, has recently been showing off the new paint job of its first A220-100, due to enter service in early 2019."

Delta's first Airbus A220 (CSeries) rolls out of Montreal paint shop - USA TODAY,"Fri, 14 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdHJhdmVsL2ZsaWdodHMvdG9kYXlpbnRoZXNreS8yMDE4LzA5LzE0L2RlbHRhLWFpci1saW5lcy1haXJidXMtMjIwLWNzZXJpZXMtcm9sbHMtb3V0LXBhaW50LXNob3AvMTMwMDYyMTAwMi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Delta's first Airbus A220 (CSeries) rolls out of Montreal paint shop

Delta Air Lines’ newest aircraft type – the Airbus A220 – rolled out of a Quebec paint shop with a Delta paint scheme for the first time Thursday evening.

The aircraft, known as the ""Bombardier CSeries"" until it was rebranded in July, is expected to begin flying for Delta in early 2019.

Delta says the A220 painting process took nine days, 200 rolls of masking tape and 165 gallons of paint to complete.

“There’s nothing like seeing years of planning come together in the shape of a freshly painted aircraft,” Larry Cato, a program manager on Delta’s Fleet Management team, said in a statement. “It’s a major milestone for the future of our fleet.”

TODAY IN THE SKY: As Delta awaits C Series, the airline's MD-88s will have to keep flying

The next stop for the plane unveiled Thursday is a trip to final assembly in Mirabel, Quebec, near Montreal. It will then begin flight-testing later this fall.

Delta is the first U.S. carrier to order the jet. Delta’s order for at least 75 the aircraft threw a lifeline to the then-struggling CSeries. Airbus has since taken a majority stake in the aircraft line, which precipitated the new name.

“It’s a tremendous feeling of accomplishment to know we just outfitted North America’s first A220 from tail to tip,” Julie Léveillé, an Airbus supervisor in the Mirabel paint shop, added in Delta’s statement. “I’ve been working in the paint shop for 15 years. It can be a challenging job, but seeing the finished product makes it worth it.”

The $446 million Airbus A380 is the largest and most expensive airliner in the world. Take a look inside. - Yahoo Finance Australia,"Mon, 03 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vYXUuZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy80NDYtbWlsbGlvbi1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1sYXJnZXN0LTAyNTcwMDk5Ni5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A380 superjumbo is the largest commercial airliner in history.

The A380 was once thought to have the potential to revolutionise air travel.

Instead, the 331 Airbus superjumbos sold now play more of a niche role for flights operating in high-congestion areas.

The A380 first flew in 2005 and entered service in 2007.

A while back, we had the chance to take a tour of an A380s belonging to Etihad Airways.

The Airbus A380 is one of the most impressive and controversial aeroplanes in aviation history. And as the largest airliner in the world, the A380 is undoubtedly a technological wonder.

When the European planemaker dreamed up the A380 three decades ago, it was for an aircraft that would revolutionise air travel, with grand visions of unprecedented luxury for passengers and earnings power for airlines.

Things haven't worked out quite as well as Airbus hoped. Instead of becoming the workhorse of airlines around the world, the A380 has become relegated to niche duty for high-traffic airports and markets with congestion issues.

Since the early 2000s, Airbus has managed to sell only 331 A380s, with more than half to Dubai's Emirates.

Some industry observers, such as the Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia, have gone so far as to call it the biggest mistake in the history of Airbus. According to Aboulafia, the A380 is a poorly executed aircraft designed for a market that doesn't really exist. As a result, the $US25 billion that Airbus spent on the A380 program could have been better used elsewhere, like on a rival for Boeing's next-generation 777X or on a true replacement for the ageing 757, Aboulafia told Business Insider.

Regardless of the challenges the A380 program faces, the superjumbo remains a truly impressive aircraft. The Airbus A380 is the company's most expensive airliner, with a list price of $US445.6 million. That's more than $US79 million more than Airbus's second-priciest offering, the A350-1000. It's nearly $US43 million more than the Boeing 747-8 and $US19.8 million more than Boeing's next-generation 777-9.

Story continues

A while back, Etihad Airways gave Business Insider access to one of its A380s on the tarmac at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport.

Let's take a closer look at Etihad's Airbus A380 superjumbo:

The Airbus A380 made its maiden flight in 2005 ...

... before entering service with Singapore Airlines in 2007.

The superjumbo eventually joined the fleets of Emirates ...

... Lufthansa ...

... China Southern ...

... Air France ...

... Korean Air ...

... and Qantas, among others.

Etihad took delivery of its first A380 in December 2014 and now operates a fleet of 10 superjumbos.

The plane we toured, A6-APA, was actually the first A380 delivered to the airline.

The A380's height -- at 79ft -- requires multiple specialised catering trucks to stock its galleys.

There were more catering trucks at the back of the aircraft.

Underneath the A380 is a truly impressive landing gear that boasts 22 wheels on five bogies.

This particular A380 is powered by a quartet of Engine Alliance GP7200 turbofan engines, each producing more than 70,000 pounds of thrust. Engine Alliance is a joint venture between Pratt & Whitney and GE.

Some A380s are also powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines.

Let's step on board this beast.

The economy-class cabin fills the entire main deck of the Etihad A380.

Each of the 415 economy seats is 17.5 inches wide with 31 inches of seat pitch.

Etihad's recently updated seats come with 11-inch seatback touchscreens. If both decks are jam-packed with the economy seats, the A380 can fly more than 800 passengers per flight.

Walk to the back main deck and you'll come across the A380's rear spiral staircase.

Make your way up the stairs ...

... and you'll find the business-class cabin.

Each of the 70 business-class seats boasts 73 inches of seat pitch and folds flat into a bed at the touch of a button.

Each seat is equipped with an 18.5-inch entertainment screen.

Walk toward the front of the upper deck ...

... and you come up to the A380's premium cabin lounge. According to Etihad, it's designed to mimic the look and feel of a luxury hotel lounge where passengers can socialise and even watch live sporting events.

Passengers can also grab a drink and a midflight snack.

Emirates' A380s have a lounge at the back of the upper deck, while Korean Air's A380s have cocktail lounges at the front and the rear of the deck.

Ahead of the lounge is the first-class cabin. Etihad's A380s boast two types of private first-class suites. The first is the called ""The Apartment.""

There are eight Apartment suites per A380.

Each suite boasts about 45 square feet of space.

It features a seat ...

... and a divan that can be converted into a bed. The suites all feature 24-inch flat-screen TVs ...

... vanity mirrors ...

... and retractable dividers.

The Apartment suites also have access to the shower at the front of the upper deck.

But what sets Etihad's fleet apartment from all other A380s is ""The Residence."" There is only one Residence suite per aircraft, and tickets can cost more than $US40,000 for a round trip between New York and Abu Dhabi.

Why is it so expensive? Well, because The Residence is just that: a 125-square-foot home away from home aboard a plane, complete with a living room ...

... a private bathroom with a shower ...

... and a bedroom with a double bed.

The bedroom is equipped with a 27-inch TV, while the living room gets a 32-inch unit.

Not only do passengers travelling in The Residence have access to a personal butler during the flight, but they also have access to a private lounge at the airport.

Make your way down the front staircase, and you come upon the flight deck.

The ultramodern cockpit boasts eight high-definition LCDs supplied by the French industrial giant Thales Group.

Incredibly, this beast of an aircraft requires only two pilots to operate.

Throttle up!

Like all modern Airbus jets, the A380 uses sidestick controls as opposed to a traditional yoke.

And that's the end the of our tour. Enjoy your flight!"

It's the latest in a new generation of fuel-efficient, carbon composite airliners to launch in recent years.

The A350-1000 is seen as a rival for Boeing 777-300ER and a replacement for the Boeing 747 jumbo jet.

The Airbus A350-1000 entered service with Qatar Airways in February. It is the latest in a new generation of the fuel-efficient, carbon-composite, wide-body airliners to launch in recent years.

With four-engine jumbo jets like the Boeing 747 and the Airbus A380 quickly losing favor with airlines, smaller, more efficient twin-engine widebodies have taken their place as the industry's workhorse long-haul jets. In fact, Virgin Atlantic is expected to replace its 747-400s with a fleet of A350-1000s over the next few years.

Thus far, the Boeing 777 is the most successful of the twin-engine wide-bodies with 1,988 sold since its debut in 1994. Launched in 2002, the Boeing 777-300ER is, by far, the most popular version of the twin-jet and accounts for about 42% of the plane's sales total.

Airbus has 890 orders for the A350; 168 of which are for the Dash 1000.

Until the A350-1000's arrival, Airbus didn't really have a true rival for the 777-300ER. The A330-300 had the size, but not quite the range while the quad-engine A340-600 had the range and the capacity, but was far less efficient.

In fact, Qatar is actually operating the A350-1000 alongside its existing fleet of 777-300ERs.

""The A350-1000 is performing very well in our fleet,"" Qatar Airways Group CEO Akbar Al Baker said to a roundtable of reporters at the 2018 Farnborough International Airshow in July. ""Actually, it's performing better than what we envisaged.""

According to Airbus, the A350 is capable of delivering 25% better fuel efficiency and a 25% unit costs compared to previous generation aircraft like the 777.

""Yes, they are right,"" Al Baker said regarding Airbus's efficiency claims. ""And this is why Boeing has launched the 777X to compete against the fuel efficiency of the Airbus A350-1000.""

Qatar Airways also has orders in place for 60 of Boeing next-generation 777X airliners that are expected to enter service in 2020.

The Doha, Qatar-based airline was also the launch customer of the smaller A350-900 back in 2014.

At the Farnborough Air Show, Airbus brought along an A350-1000 prototype for flight demonstrations while Qatar Airways showed off one of its Dash 1000s for guests and journalists.

First Ultra Long Range A350 XWB delivered to Singapore Airlines - Airbus,"Sat, 22 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wOS1maXJzdC11bHRyYS1sb25nLXJhbmdlLWEzNTAteHdiLWRlbGl2ZXJlZC10by1zaW5nYXBvcmUtYWlybGluZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has delivered the first A350-900 Ultra Long Range (ULR) aircraft to launch customer Singapore Airlines (SIA). The aircraft is being prepared for flight and is scheduled to depart Toulouse for Singapore later today.

The latest variant of the best-selling A350 XWB is capable of flying further in commercial service than any other aircraft, with a range of up to 9,700 nautical miles, or over 20 hours non-stop. Altogether, SIA has ordered seven A350-900ULR aircraft, configured in a two-class layout, with 67 Business Class seats and 94 Premium Economy Class seats.

SIA will begin operating the A350-900ULR on 11th October, when it will launch non-stop services between Singapore and New York. With an average flying time of 18 hours and 45 minutes, these will be the world’s longest commercial flights. Following New York, the aircraft will enter service with SIA on two more non-stop transpacific routes, to Los Angeles and San Francisco.

“This is a proud moment for both Singapore Airlines and Airbus, not only because we have again strengthened our partnership, but also because we have pushed the limits with this highly advanced new aircraft to extend long-range flying to new lengths,” said Singapore Airlines CEO, Mr Goh Choon Phong. “The A350-900ULR will bring more convenience and comfort to our customers and will enable us to operate ultra-long-range flights in a commercially viable manner. It will help us boost our network competitiveness and further grow the Singapore hub.”

“Today’s delivery is a milestone for Airbus and Singapore Airlines, as together we open a new chapter in non-stop air travel,” said Tom Enders, Chief Executive Officer, Airbus. “With its unrivalled range and step-change in fuel efficiency, the A350 is uniquely placed to meet demand for new ultra long haul services. The combination of the A350’s quiet, spacious cabin and SIA’s world-renowned in-flight product will ensure the highest levels of passenger comfort on the world’s very longest routes.”

The A350-900ULR is a development of the A350-900. The main change over the standard aircraft is a modified fuel system, enabling the fuel carrying capacity to be increased by 24,000 litres to 165,000 litres. This extends the range of the aircraft without the need for additional fuel tanks. In addition, the aircraft features a number of aerodynamic enhancements, including extended winglets, which are now being applied to all in-production A350-900 aircraft.

The A350 XWB is the newest and most modern widebody aircraft family, incorporating the latest aerodynamic design, carbon fibre fuselage and wings, plus new fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce engines. Together, these latest technologies translate into unrivalled levels of operational efficiency, with a 25 per cent reduction in fuel consumption and emissions, and significantly lower maintenance costs.

The A350 XWB features the Airspace by Airbus cabin, which is designed to enhance comfort and well-being on long flights. The aircraft has the quietest cabin of any twin aisle widebody and features the latest air conditioning, temperature management and mood lighting systems, with an optimised cabin altitude and higher humidity levels. The aircraft also features the latest in-flight entertainment and WiFi systems, with full connectivity throughout.

As at the end of August 2018, Airbus had recorded a total of 890 firm orders for the A350 XWB from 46 customers worldwide, already making it one of the most successful widebody aircraft ever. Almost 200 A350 XWB aircraft have already been delivered and are in service with 21 airlines, flying primarily on long range services.

Singapore Airlines is one of the largest customers for the A350 XWB Family, having ordered a total of 67 A350-900s, including the seven Ultra Long Range models. Including today’s delivery, the airline’s A350 XWB fleet now stands at 22 aircraft."

Based in Hanscom, MA, Boston MedFlight provides helicopter, fixed-wing, and ground ambulance services for the state’s critically ill and injured patients.

Established to provide a regional emergency transport system focused on excellent patient care and high reliability, Boston MedFlight makes up part of a unique programme, partnering with a consortium of six hospitals to provide non-competitive, patient-first care. As their online mission statement puts it: “Our daily mission is to provide the right vehicle to the right patient at the right time and transport them to the right facility.”

The helicopters carry a three-person crew on average – the pilot, a critical care transport nurse and a paramedic – with space for up to two patients, and a seat for a family member if needed.

Among its missions, approximately 45.8% are carried out by a four-strong helicopter fleet, based at Hanscom Field, Plymouth Municipal Airport, Lawrence Municipal Airport, and Mansfield. In March 2018, the EMS transport provider took delivery of a new H145, the first of three that are set to join the fleet. The need is great, as Boston MedFlight transports some 4,000 critical care patients a year, or approximately 1,842 missions yearly.

Boston MedFlight transports some 4,000 critical care patients a year, or approximately 1,842 missions yearly.

The helicopters carry a three-person crew on average – the pilot, a critical care transport nurse and a paramedic – with space for up to two patients, and a seat for a family member if needed. Fully equipped for ICU care onboard, the helicopters make up a fast and reliable form of transportation in nearly any weather condition. “We have instrument approaches to all of our hospital helipads in Boston and this is a more capable aircraft for that mission,” says Lynda Colarossi, Chief Pilot Boston MedFlight, speaking of the new H145.

“Our daily mission is to provide the right vehicle to the right patient at the right time and transport them to the right facility” – Boston MedFlight mission statement.

Here, Colarossi and pilot Keith Lanteigne speak in more detail about the newest member of their Boston fleet, the H145."

How to avoid sitting in the middle seat on your next flight - Business Insider,"Sat, 01 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vaG93LXRvLWF2b2lkLXRoZS13b3JzdC1zZWF0LW9uLXBsYW5lLTIwMTgtNdIBT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vaG93LXRvLWF2b2lkLXRoZS13b3JzdC1zZWF0LW9uLXBsYW5lLTIwMTgtNT9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The middle seat is the worst seat on a plane. It's cramped and inconvenient.

You can avoid the middle seat by booking your flight early or avoiding basic economy tickets.

You also decrease the likelihood of getting a middle seat by carefully selecting the type of aircraft you fly.

The Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320 fly with six-seats per row with two middle seats per row. Aircraft like the Airbus A220 has only one middle seat per row while the Embraer E190-E2 has no middle seats.

The middle seat — especially in coach — is one of the most dreaded and common scenarios in flying.

It's cramped, it's inconvenient, and it's often the only seat available on flights — particularly if you book at the last minute.

In the past, an easy way to ensure you get an aisle or window seat is to book your flight early.

However, airlines have figured out that their customers have an almost universal hatred for the middle seat.

Not only that, airlines have come to realize that many are actually willing to pay to avoid it.

For instance, most Basic Economy tickets allow passengers to select their seats only after checking in — at which point the window and aisle seats are likely to already be gone. (Note: Alaska Airlines does allow early seat selection for its basic economy fares.)

This means passengers will have to buy more expensive main cabin tickets in order to select seats at the time of booking.

On the other hand, Southwest — which doesn't assign seats — charges passengers as much as $50 for the privilege of boarding early.

Although it is impossible to completely rule out the possibility of ending up in the middle seat, there are several ways to avoid it without having to pony up extra dough.

First, in spite of the revenue generating fees airlines have come up with, booking early is still the best way to ensure you don't end up sandwiched in the middle. In addition to an increased likelihood of getting an aisle or window seats, booking early will also net you cheaper ticket prices.

According to a 2014 study by Expedia, the average price of tickets are its lowest 57 days ahead of the flight. A 2016 study, also conducted by Expedia, shows that those buying tickets more than three weeks in advance can expect to see savings of as much as 30%.

In fact, savings from cheaper tickets prices may allow you to ""splurge"" on the fees for aisle or window seats.

The right plane makes all the difference

Second, the plane used to operate the flight makes a big difference as well. These days, the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 along with their many derivatives dominate the short-to-medium-range market. Both aircraft are generally configured with six-abreast seating or six seats per row with two sections of three seats divided by a single aisle. This results in two middle seats per row.

However, there are ways to reduce the likelihood of ending up in the middle seat by taking flights using planes with fewer or no middle seats on board.

Instead of the 737 and A320, look for flights operated by Airbus A220 (Bombardier C Series), Sukhoi SuperJet 100, McDonnell Douglas MD80 series, MD90, and Boeing 717-200 jets. These aircraft feature five-abreast seating in a 3-2 configuration — meaning there is only one middle seat per row.

In the US, the McDonnell Douglas aircraft are mostly operated by Delta, American, and Allegiant. However, all three carriers are working to quickly replace their MD fleets with new 737 and A320-family planes. With that said, Delta and Hawaiian's Boeing 717-200s are expected to remain in service well into the next decade.

The Bombardier C-Series entered service with SWISS in July 2016. Over the next few years, the Canadian jetliner will become a more common sight in airports around the world with Delta, JetBlue, Air Canada, Air Baltic, SWISS, and Korean Air as its most well-known operators.

The Sukhoi Superjet is mainly operated by Russsian carriers. However, Mexico's Interjet does have around 20 in its fleet.

Another option is to take flights operated for the major airlines by regional carriers under names such as Delta Connection, United Express, and American Eagle. These flights are generally operated using regional jets or turboprop airliners.

Even though regional aircraft are smaller and more cramped, they are generally set up in a 2-2 configuration which means there are no middle seats. Here, look for aircraft such as the Bombardier CRJ, the Q400 turboprop as well as the Embraer ERJ.

The Embraer E170 and E190 series is a good 'tweener option. Seating anywhere between 70 to 100 passengers, the E-Jet operates both as a regional airliner and with mainline carriers such as American, Air Canada, Polish LOT, and JetBlue. Like the smaller regional jets, the E-Jet is usually set up in a 2-2 configuration with no middle seats. Embraer recently launched the second generation E-Jet called the E2 so expect this to be an option for many years to come.

Unfortunately for many flyers around the world, the narrow-body airliner fleet in Asia and Europe is a virtual duopoly split between the 737 and the A320-family. As a result, apart from encountering the odd C-Series, E-Jet or 717, passengers will have to fly on a regional jet to avoid six-abreast seating.

Choosing a flight based on the airplane also works on long-haul international flights. These flights are commonly operated by wide-body, twin-aisle airliners such as the Boeing 777, 787, and Airbus A350 as well as the larger Boeing 747 jumbos and the Airbus A380 superjumbos.

These large jets are generally set up with nine or even 10-abreast seating in a 3-3-3 or 3-4-3 configuration with either three or four middle seats per row in coach.

For flyers looking to avoid middle seats on long-haul flights, there are several types of aircraft they should hone in on.

First, Boeing's venerable twin-engine 767 wide-body is still around and can commonly be found with a 2-3-2 configuration. That means there's only one middle seat per row in coach. It should be noted, however, that many of the 767s are pushing 20 years of age and like the MD80/90, airlines such as American, Delta, and United are in the process of replacing them with newer models.

With the 767 on the way out, look for flights operated by the twin-engine Airbus A330 and its discontinued four-engined sibling, the A340. These airliners generally feature eight-abreast seating in a 2-4-2 configuration. As a result, the A330/A340 generally fly with only two middle seats per row in coach.

Fortunately, for flyers, the A330 one of the most popular wide-body airliners in the world with about 1,500 examples in operation and is still rolling off Airbus production lines. In fact, the company is currently selling a next-generation version called the A330neo."

The H135 was delivered in HEMS configuration, fully equipped with the latest medical interior, and will perform life-saving EMS missions in Qingdao and the surrounding area. It is the first H135 to be delivered to China with Airbus’ latest generation Helionix avionics suite, which increases safety and decreases pilot workload.

At the ceremony, United General Aviation Industrial Development Co. Ltd. (UGA), Airbus Helicopters’ distributor in China, signed a contract with Eastern General Aviation Company for two H135s. UGA has also previously secured a framework agreement with Qingdao Huatong Financial Leasing Co. Ltd. (Huatong Leasing) for six H135s.

The first five H135s of the order for 100, including the one delivered today, are being assembled in Donauwörth, Germany, where Chinese final assembly line (FAL) employees have been receiving on-the-job training from their German counterparts since April 2018. The remaining 95 will be assembled in Qingdao on the H135 FAL which broke ground in 2017. The construction of the FAL will be completed by the end of 2018 and will enter into operation in early 2019 on schedule.

“This delivery represents the first of many milestones supporting our commitment to serve the Chinese market with H135s made in Qingdao. We are proud of our ambitious 50-year partnership with China and cannot imagine a better way to kick off our next 50 years together,” said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters.

Airbus Helicopters holds the leading position in the Chinese civil and parapublic helicopter market. As of August 2018, there were approximately 280 Airbus helicopters flying in China serving 75 customers.

The company is committed to working hand-in-hand with Chinese administration, private operators and industrial partners to meet the rotorcraft needs of this growing market, which has experienced annual growth of 20 percent in recent years.

The H135 is one of the most popular light twin-engine helicopters in China, mainly operating in helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS), search and rescue, law enforcement, firefighting and tourism. To date, more than 1,270 helicopters of the H135 family are in operation around the globe with close to 5 million flight hours."

Credit: © Airbus SAS 2018.

Airbus has successfully carried out manned-unmanned teaming (MUT) test flight campaigns for future air combat systems.

The campaigns were conducted using five Airbus-built Do-DT25 target drones that demonstrated the ability to control unmanned systems from a manned aircraft.

Flight tests were carried out in a test zone of Germany’s Baltic Sea area. They involved the drones being controlled by a mission group commander who was airborne in a manned command and control aircraft.

The MUT trial flights served multiple purposes, including validating elements such as connectivity, human-machine interface, and the concept of teaming intelligence through mission group management.

“Fitted with sensors, the unmanned systems can provide situational awareness to a mission group commander deployed at a safe distance away on board a manned aircraft.”

A major element that supported the successful test flights was the advanced flight control and flight management system for unmanned air vehicles.

Developed by Airbus, the system combines fully automatic guidance, navigation and control with intelligent swarming capabilities.

INTERVIEW: New Airbus Helicopters chief Bruno Even outlines his plans - Flightglobal,"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaW50ZXJ2aWV3LW5ldy1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtY2hpZWYtYnJ1bm8tZXZlbi1vdXRsaW5lcy1oaXMtcGxhbnMvMTI5NjE4LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Listening back to our interview with Bruno Even, the new chief executive of Airbus Helicopters, there is a strange rhythmic noise captured on the recording.

It comes and goes, but every now and again there is a sound like rain pattering on a window.

And then I realise: periodically throughout the interview Even was drumming his fingers on the table and it is this percussive rat-a-tat-tat that has been picked up.

Nerves did not seem to be the cause – he gave no sign of discomfort in his answers – if anything it appeared to be a sign that he was thinking deeply or was passionate about his response.

The second thing that is apparent is Even's relative candour, albeit within the constraints of what CEOs typically can or will say to the press.

For instance, Even admits there is little prospect of the H225 returning to oil and gas operations in the North Sea, at least in the short or medium term.

While that may simply be an acknowledgement of market reality, his predecessor, Guillaume Faury, never appeared ready to say that in public.

But Even has much to thank his predecessor for. He arrived at Airbus Helicopters on 1 April, following a three-year stint heading Safran Helicopter Engines, to find the Franco-German manufacturer in reasonably robust health, particularly considering the awful market conditions afflicting the rotorcraft sector, notably on the civil side.

Seen here in air ambulance guise, the H145 light-twin is “key pillar” for firm

Airbus Helicopters

Under Faury's stewardship, Airbus Helicopters had rebranded, reshaped its range, launched a new programme – the medium-twin H160 – and embarked on a broad transformation of both its industrial model and the way it does business.

Nothing left for Even to do then? Far from it, he thinks. He notes the continued ""challenging"" market, which, even if the picture looks rosier than it did 12 or 18 months ago, is still not that of a sector buoyed with optimism.

That situation means that competitors are ""very aggressive"" he says and customers are ""more and more demanding"" while ""requiring excellence from the OEM"", all of which means the ongoing transformation must continue, he adds.

As market leader in the civil and parapublic space, Even also thinks Airbus Helicopters must preserve that position, despite the difficult context.

""At the same time, we are still optimistic about the mid- and long-term in the helicopter market,"" he says.

""So yes, today we are facing a difficult market – it has been declining since two or four years – but I'm really convinced it's an opportunity for Airbus Helicopters, as long as we are launching the right transformation.

""So, the first challenge that I see is in terms of transformation – continue to deliver the level of excellence that our customers and the market require.""

MULTI-FACETED APPROACH

That transformation – and it's a word that features frequently over the course of our hour-long interview – encompasses many things: people, processes, and the way the company interacts with its customers.

While modestly declining to list his triumphs at the helm of Safran Helicopter Engines (""it is always difficult to speak about your own achievements""), Even believes that one of his notable feats, was, yes, transformation: turning the propulsion specialist from being ""product-orientated to customer-orientated"".

""To move from customer satisfaction to customer loyalty – it is probably one of my legacies [at Safran] and it's something I would like to work on at Airbus Helicopters,"" he says.

""As with all industries, when you are a world leader in a difficult market environment it is your responsibility with your team to launch some major transformation initiatives, not for the pleasure to transform, but because you have this responsibility to your company, to your employees, to become more competitive and to keep the capacity to continue to invest for the future and to ensure the sustainability of your company.

""But it is also for the benefit of our customers – it is our responsibility to transform, to provide value and to answer to what they expect.""

That desire has been shaped, not least, by the conversations Even has had with key operators since taking on the role.

""When it comes to our customers they tell me that yes, Airbus Helicopters has an historic role and a strong position in the market. We have a competitive product, we have a strong product, but we still have work to do when it comes to customer orientation, when it comes to providing the best service.""

Having a clear vision is crucial, explains Even

Airbus Helicopters

Clients are aware that the company had already changed under the previous management and is ""walking in the right direction"", he notes, but ""the message is 'please continue – you are not at the end of the journey'.""

Of course, the other key body that a successful chief executive must consult is an organisation's workforce. What they crave, says Even, is clarity on the direction of travel and the company's ultimate strategic goals.

""It's my management style: I'm convinced that one of our key roles as managers is to put into perspective where we want to go and our mission for the company. As long as we are clear on where we want to go, it's extremely powerful.""

Priorities, he says, will be to maintain its position in the market, investment in technology and infrastructure ""to be in a position to capture new opportunities"" – both geographical and from emerging segments such as urban air mobility – and providing more value to customers.

""We have some areas where we need to reinforce our actions: around customers, to develop customer loyalty; around innovation – it's clearly in our DNA but we need to continue to invest; and in emerging or fast-growing markets – China India, globally Southeast Asia – where we have already had some success, but where we need to reinforce our position to capture the opportunity we see for the future.""

Nonetheless, Even believes that the current turnover splits in the business – between new platform sales and support, and between civil and military – are nicely balanced, which, coupled with its sizeable international footprint, have delivered a ""business model which is resilient"".

Ultimately though, a manufacturer of anything lives and dies by its core product. Even thinks the range as it is – spanning the H125 light-single at one end, to the heavy-twin H225 and NH90, via the NH Industries consortium, at the other – is a particular strength.

MEND THE GAP

The immediate priority, however, is to achieve certification for the H160 medium-twin and ensure a smooth service entry for the platform in 2020, which should help address an obvious gap in its range.

""Today we have strong expectations for the H160 as it will address a segment where we are quite weak compared with the competition,"" notes Even.

Elsewhere, Airbus Helicopters is investing to improve the reliability of its most recent arrival, the H175 super-medium, and in the background working on potential upgrades for its other rotorcraft.

While inevitably Even declines to be drawn on which platforms are first in line for any enhancement, he lists the 4t-class H145 light-twin as an example where, despite, or perhaps because of, the helicopter's obvious sales success, the airframer has a ""responsibility"" to maintain ""the competitiveness of the product for the mid- and long term"".

Asked specifically if that means the H145, the latest version of which only arrived in 2014, is being considered for another upgrade, Even offers a non-committal answer: ""It is fair to say that, as we are working on all our product range, because I consider our first priority, in addition to the H160, is to ensure that not only today but for the mid-term [our helicopters] will still be as competitive as [they are] today.

""But H145 for sure is one of the key pillars of our product range so you can imagine it is one of our priorities.""

Equally, the light-single line-up could be an area of focus as Airbus Helicopters addresses the future of its H125 and H130.

""I will not share with you more detail but it's our responsibility to think what could be the next step for our light-single range. The H125 is one of our key pillars,"" says Even. Although offering no more detail, the sense is that an upgrade would be more likely than a clean-sheet development.

While not addressing the H125 specifically, Even seems unconvinced that the time is right for any new programme launch.

Airbus Helicopters continues to work on new technologies that would underpin either a modernisation or an all-new aircraft, he says, ""but I don't see from the market a need for a new helicopter in the next two or three years.

""When you launch a new helicopter it is not because you are pleased to launch a new programme, it is to ensure you are providing value and answering to the expectations of the market.""

Instead, it will invest in the existing range, he says, while working behind the scenes on ""technological bricks"" – autonomy, electric propulsion, digital connectivity – that will be sufficiently mature to employ on any new programme the market demands.

At least some of those advances had seemed destined for the X6, seen as a successor to the H225 and which was due to arrive in the early 2020s. However, that development effort was effectively frozen by the previous chief executive earlier this year. That means Airbus Helicopters' offering in the heavy segment will be confined for the foreseeable future to the H215 and the H225.

TWIN TRACKS

The latter has led a double life over the past two years: on the one hand, civil demand for new examples has shrunk dramatically – driven by safety concerns and a decimated oil and gas market – while military sales have been brisk.

In addition, a large pool of commercial H225s has been returned to lessors or financial institutions, notably from operator CHC Helicopter as part of its Chapter 11 restructuring.

While acknowledging the challenges in the civil market, Even believes the company has been ""quite successful"" in ""repurposing"" the unwanted Super Pumas, selling 21 ex-CHC units to Ukraine's interior ministry.

""Today it is more than 40 [H225s] where we have found opportunities to repurpose them for new missions,"" he points out.

""When I look at the market now since two, three, four years, the civil market for the heavies, for all the industry, is quite tough. But I’m still convinced that as it is for the military market, the H225 is a very competitive offer also for the civil market.""

Even insists that the H225 has maintained a presence in the oil and gas segment ""in Vietnam, in China, in Brazil"", but admits that offshore overcapacity and the ramifications from the ""sad accident"" in Norway in 2016, in which 13 died, mean the type has yet to make a full return.

He argues, however, that with the regulator-approved safety barriers Airbus Helicopters has put in place on the type ""I don’t see any reason to have the H225 flying in oil and gas, not only in China, Vietnam and Brazil, but in other regions.""

All of this sounds similar to the line his predecessor maintained – a robust, Canute-esque defence of the product. But Even seems sufficiently savvy to realise that if you are faced with significant workforce opposition to a helicopter's reintroduction, it may be better to take a more emollient approach and admit defeat.

""It is true that for the North Sea there is a specific context that I respect, a specific emotion related to the past years, and I respect totally that situation.

""So, from that perspective, probably I don't see the H225 flying in this region, in the North Sea, in oil and gas in particular. At the end, I will follow what the market and our customers are asking for.""

Although it is true that Airbus Helicopters has no full-scale development programmes on the go, it does have a pair of demonstrators that are scheduled to make their maiden sorties over the next two years.

First to fly later this year will be City Airbus: an electrically powered vertical take-off and landing urban air mobility vehicle – neatly encapsulating a number of current industry buzzwords – being built at the manufacturer's Donauwörth, Germany site. That will be followed in 2020 by the Racer high-speed compound rotorcraft being developed under the EU's Clean Sky 2 programme.

Assuming that the airframer can master the technology in both cases, then the next significant hurdle is to prove a market for the platforms, plus, in the case of City Airbus, to gain regulatory acceptance for a new form of transport.

Although high-speed vertical lift has proved itself in the military domain, there has yet to be a similar breakthrough in the commercial space.

Even points out that the question is not whether Airbus Helicopters can successfully validate the Racer's architecture – he's unsurprisingly confident on that front – but ""is there a solution which meets both the need for speed and the need for competitiveness?""

Describing it as a ""good compromise"", he feels that the proposed pusher-prop configuration, as well as the use of 'cruise mode' technology on the aircraft's twin SHE Aneto engines, will allow the Racer to meet those sometimes opposing targets.

""But like any demonstrator we need first to mature the technology, demonstrate and then come to a programme [launch] if we can show that we can answer the market requirements. We are not yet at this stage.""

The picture for City Airbus and the dozens of similar platforms being worked on elsewhere is more nuanced, stresses Even. While convinced of the basic need for urban air mobility solutions – overcoming the ""difficulty to move from point a to point b"" in crowded cities – he reels off a list of potential obstacles to their uptake: technology, new certification standards, air traffic management and social acceptance.

""We have all these questions, but at the same time, considering the opportunity that this business could bring, we consider as Airbus, that we cannot miss out.

""It is our responsibility based on all our expertise… that we need to invest in order to be ready, to position ourselves – not only at platform level but at service level,"" he says.

Very early on in the interview, I ask Even why he coveted the top job at Airbus Helicopters. Although it might seem a little odd to introduce that at the end of the piece, his response serves as a neat coda, a summation of his character, if you like.

""When you are working in the helicopter market for so many years, Airbus Helicopters was always one of our key customers – a world leader in segment – when you have the opportunity to join that company, and in particular as chief executive, you have to say you don't hesitate.

""You don't hesitate when you are proposed to take on this responsibility and I didn’t,"" he says.

Hang on with us. …Newer model used aircraft are absolutely something we have an eye out for. As we take a look at where 319s are available we’re gonna be out there after them, because we want ’em” …they’re a little bit larger than we need in terms of total seating capacity but when you take a look at the operating economics, when you put it into our fleet, it works really well.



American Airlines Airbus A319

There was a rumor at the time that American would pick up these narrowbody aircraft from Frontier Airlines but then time passed and nothing happened.

Now it seems that American Airlines is receiving its first ex-Frontier A319, registration N922FR. It’s being transferred to American.

The aircraft was flown from Tampa to Goodyear, Arizona on Thursday.

This is the first of 3 used A319s leased by American. No doubt this plane will debut for American in standard configuration with just 8 first class seats, 8 forward rows of extra legroom coach (plus the exit row), and 128 total seats and – unlike the legacy American Airlines A319s — no seat back video."

AirSeas’ pioneering system to improve transport efficiency

Hamburg - Airbus has placed a firm order with AirSeas during the international maritime trade fair SMM to purchase the first ever automated kite, named SeaWing.

Vincent Bernatets (left), CEO AirSeas, and Benoit Lemonnier, Head of Transport & Logistics Airbus, after signing the Certificate Order at the SMM Maritime Trade Fair 2018 in Hamburg.

SeaWing is an automated kite based on parafoil technology used to tow commercial ships. Airbus is focusing on improving productivity and delivering aircraft faster and more cost effectively for its customers. SeaWing offers a new way of cutting shipping fuel costs by 20 percent and will reduce Airbus’ overall industrial environmental footprint by 8,000 tons of CO2 per year. Airbus owns a fleet of four RO-RO ships to transport aircraft parts around Europe and the USA.

SeaWing combines aeronautical know-how with maritime technology to create a breakthrough in the maritime transportation sector. A simple switch launches or recovers the kite which unfolds, operates and refolds autonomously. The system collects and analyses meteorological and oceanic data in real-time. SeaWing adapts to this information in order to optimise its performance as well as ensure maximum safety.

Vincent Bernatets, CEO of AirSeas, said: “We are very proud that Airbus has confirmed its confidence in the SeaWing system after seeing our test results first-hand on their own ship. This first ro-ro vessel installation opens the way for further pioneering deals on container ships, bulkers and ferries. We are glad we can start helping our customers to reduce ship emissions in order to preserve the environment.”"

Generally speaking, as a company grows, institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely, insiders often decrease their ownership over time. Companies that used to be publicly owned tend to have lower insider ownership.

Airbus is a pretty big company. It has a market capitalization of €82.37b. Normally institutions would own a significant portion of a company this size. Our analysis of the ownership of the company, below, shows that institutions own shares in the company. Let’s take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholder can tell us about AIR.

See our latest analysis for Airbus

ENXTPA:AIR Ownership Summary September 4th 18

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Airbus?

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

Airbus already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own 22.0% of the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Airbus, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.

ENXTPA:AIR Income Statement Export September 4th 18

Airbus is not owned by hedge funds. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.

Insider Ownership Of Airbus

The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.

Story continues

Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Airbus SE. But they may have an indirect interest through a corporate structure that we haven’t picked up on. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own €13.0m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.

General Public Ownership

The general public holds a 40.6% stake in AIR. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Private Company Ownership

Our data indicates that Private Companies hold 26.3%, of the company’s shares. It’s hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.

Next Steps:

It’s always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Airbus better, we need to consider many other factors.

Many find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past. You can access this detailed graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow .

A 22-year-old student was charged on Thursday with trying to steal a passenger jet at an Orlando airport, where he jumped a fence and boarded the aircraft but was quickly detained, officials said.

The Florida Institute of Technology student had a commercial pilot's license but was not qualified to fly the aircraft, an Airbus 321, Orlando Melbourne International Airport spokeswoman Lori Booker told reporters. He did not manage to get the plane moving.

""There is no evidence to indicate a connection to terrorism,"" Melbourne Police Chief David Gillespie said at a news conference.

The man's motive was unknown, Gillespie said, after police searched his home and vehicle and found no weapons or explosives. He did not appear to be under the influence of alcohol.

The man, identified as Nishal Sankat, had parked his car about 150 yards (140 metres) from the plane early on Thursday and kept it running before jumping the airport fence, Booker said. After he reached the flight deck of the plane, two technicians and two security guards detained him before he could attempt to start the aircraft.

""We are pretty proud of the security success that we had,"" Booker said. ""Within two minutes, not only was he challenged, stopped, detained and arrested, but we prevented much further from happening.""

The American Airlines plane was at a maintenance facility for the installation of broadband WiFi, a spokeswoman for the airline said in an email.

The incident occurred a little over a month after an airline worker stole an empty passenger airplane from Seattle's airport and crashed it into a nearby sparsely populated island.

Sankat was charged in Florida state court with attempted theft of an aircraft, burglary and criminal trespassing, Renee Purden, chief of police for the Orlando Melbourne International Airport told reporters.

He is a dual citizen of Canada and Trinidad and Tobago with no criminal history, Gillespie said. It was not immediately clear if Sankat had obtained an attorney.

Two flights were delayed at the airport due to the security breach, the airport said on social media.

A representative for the FBI could not immediately be reached for comment.

Sankat's Facebook page said he was studying aviation management. The page also had a number of aviation-related photos, including the wreckage of a World War Two-era fighter plane in muddy ground.

Airbus Helicopters Beginning Serial Production of 3D Printed Door Latch Shafts for A350 Passenger Aircraft - 3DPrint.com,"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vM2RwcmludC5jb20vMjI1NjkyL2FpcmJ1cy1oZWxpY29wdGVycy0zZC1wcmludC1wYXJ0cy_SAUFodHRwczovLzNkcHJpbnQuY29tLzIyNTY5Mi9haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtM2QtcHJpbnQtcGFydHMvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Helicopters can perform tasks that other aircraft are not able to, with applications in fields such as construction, law enforcement, military, tourism, and transportation. 3D printing parts and components for helicopters, such as pump brackets and turbine nozzles, will allow them to be manufactured at lower costs and be more easily operated by pilots.

European aircraft manufacturer Airbus has often used 3D printing to fabricate aircraft parts, and its helicopter manufacturing division, Airbus Helicopters, has definitely followed suit over the years, using the technology to manufacture components like windshield wipers and camera mount extensions.

Now, Airbus Helicopters is getting ready to begin serial production of 3D printed door components for its A350 passenger aircraft. The Airbus facility in Donauwörth, Germany, is currently qualifying the 3D printing production of titanium door latch shafts for the long-haul aircraft, and serial production is scheduled to begin in early 2019. The first A350 aircraft containing the 3D printed components, with serial number 420, should be flying the friendly skies in 2020.

The company is using an EOS M400-4 3D printer to manufacture the latch shafts out of titanium powder. By using four laser beams to melt the powder before the components are built up, it’s possible to make them from far less material, which makes the part more lightweight but still as strong as the original latch shaft component.

“We are proud that Airbus Helicopters relies on EOS-Technology for the manufacturing of flight critical components such as latch shafts,” said Nikolai Zaepernick, Senior Vice President Central Europe with EOS. “Our systems provide a very high and reproducible quality. With this machine performance and with our know-how we can significantly support Airbus Helicopters in the certification process for the component.”

Once the current titanium latch shaft was successfully redesigned, things really got moving. Thanks to the redesign and the new production process, according to FlightGlobal, Airbus says that this new move represents its “first large-scale production of metallic 3D-printed components.”

“Our goal is to get developers making more use of 3D printing. This means that 3D printing should be taken into consideration right from the initial planning stages for new components, which may be able to be manufactured particularly easily and cost-effectively using this method. Weight savings are especially important when it comes to helicopters,” explained Luis Martin Diaz, Head of Industrial Service Centers, Airbus Helicopters Donauwörth. “Airbus will start preparations for the industrialisation of 3D-printed helicopter components this year.”

In a single 3D printing process, Airbus can produce up to 28 latch shafts on the M400-4. 3D printing has also allowed the company to make the part 45% more lightweight than the original. Because each A350 has a total of 16 latch shafts, 3D printing the parts has translated to a roughly four kg weight reduction per aircraft. In addition, Airbus has also achieved a 25% production cost reduction. All in all, the company can now offer more economical and environmentally friendly aircraft – all thanks to 3D printing.

Once its new metallic 3D printing production is fully operational, Airbus Helicopters plans to deliver 2,200 components a year. Preparations have also begun to 3D print more A350 door components, and the company also plans to use the technology to make helicopter components for its rotorcraft.

The certification was granted after a successful flight test campaign that saw around 1,400 flight test hours within a period of less than a year since the first flight on 19 October 2017.

Two A330-900 flight test aircraft were used in the campaign.

Airbus Commercial Aircraft president Guillaume Faury said: “The A330neo embodies Airbus’ spirit of innovation.

“This new generation aircraft with unparalleled efficiency and flexibility from short to long haul routes has tremendous market potential.



“We look forward to delivering the first aircraft equipped with the beautiful new Airspace cabin to our launch customer TAP Air Portugal in the coming weeks.”

“We look forward to delivering the first aircraft equipped with the beautiful new Airspace cabin to our launch customer TAP Air Portugal in the coming weeks.”

The A330-900 is part of Airbus’ A330neo family of next-generation aircraft and the larger version of the A330-800 planes, which is scheduled to make its first flight in the coming weeks.

Powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, A330-900 is said to have the lowest seat-mile cost in the 300-seater range.

The aircraft family is also equipped with new 3D-optimised wing and new sharklets developed using lighter composite materials.

These innovations are expected to reduce fuel consumption of A330-900 by 25% compared with older generation aircraft of similar size.

In addition, the A330-900 aircraft feature Airspace by Airbus cabin with newly designed sidewalls and fixtures, larger overhead storage, advanced cabin mood lighting as well as new in-flight entertainment and connectivity to offer improved level of comfort to passengers.

Operationally, the A330neo family has similar pilot type-rating with the larger A350 XWB family, which is designed to offer minimum flight training cost and maximum pilot productivity.

Airbus has received more than 1,700 orders from 120 customers for its A330 family of aircraft."

American Will Add a 5th Row of First Class to Airbus A321s - and More Coach Seats - View from the Wing,"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9hbWVyaWNhbi13aWxsLWFkZC1hLTV0aC1yb3ctb2YtZmlyc3QtY2xhc3MtdG8tYWlyYnVzLWEzMjFzLWFuZC1tb3JlLWNvYWNoLXNlYXRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"American has been flying their new domestic configuration planes since last November. First introduced with the Boeing 737 MAX 8, and in the process of retrofitting existing Boeing 737-800s, that means:

Less distance between seats for first class, extra legroom Main Cabin Extra, and regular economy which is down to 30 inches of pitch



Slimmer seats with less padding to make up for seats being tighter together (coach seats also have less recline)



No seat back entertainment, customers can stream on their own devices



Smaller lavatories



Bigger overhead bins



Faster satellite-based wireless internet, which is happening on its own separate and more rapid schedule

The 737s went from 150 seats under previous American Airlines management to 160 seats after the merger and now to 172 seats. The plan is to extend this concept of squeezing more people onto planes with American’s Airbus narrowbody fleet as well, and we’ve just learned a bit about what that is going to look like.

JonNYC shares that the new American Airlines configuration for the Airbus A321 will have 20 first class seats (one more row of first class) and 176 coach seats. A second source confirms this as well.

AA 321Neo config will be 20F 176Y — JonNYC (@xJonNYC) September 26, 2018

This is 9 – 15 additional seats compared to American’s existing Airbus A321s. Today the Airbus A321 (other than the premium version flying cross country) has:

Legacy US Airways: 187 seats including 16 first class with 36 inch pitch, 18 main cabin extra, and 153 standard coach



187 seats including 16 first class with 36 inch pitch, 18 main cabin extra, and 153 standard coach Legacy American: 181 seats including 16 first class with 38 inch pitch, 38 main cabin extra, and 127 standard coach



American Airlines Airbus A321

American will begin taking delivery of Airbus A321neo aircraft in January (‘new engine option’) and they’ll have this new configuration.

Then, as I reported back in August, American will begin to retrofit existing Airbus A321s (A312ceo or ‘current engine option’):

According to David Seymour, American’s Senior Vice President of Integrated Operations, when they take the A321neo starting in January “that will actually serve as the platform to get certification for our refurbishment and standardization of the 321s..so we can go common configuration.” That effort will start in February.

Last week American executives talked about the Airbus A321 not carrying as many passengers as the 757 but this configuration would actually cram more people into a smaller airframe than the current dense 757 American uses for Hawaii flights which has 188 seats.

The addition of a row of first class is a positive for the aircraft. US Airways A321s already had the reduced (36 inch pitch) legroom in first class. And this means more seats to escape the back. A321s are larger aircraft than Boeing 737s, and on a percentage basis ought to have more first class. With 20 first class seats that’ll be about 10% of the plane, comparable to what 737s offered prior to having 12 seats added (where 16/172 is 9%).



American’s New MiQ Domestic First Class Seat

Nonetheless this is big for possible upgrades on A321s, and it’s important for Hawaii where getting even paid premium seats can be challenging at times. Although I do wonder about the likelihood of predeparture beverages with 20 passengers to serve rather than 16.

Of course adding a row of first class means 6 additional inches out of seats in the back, compared to an additional row of coach seats. I admit I’m surprised they get to 196 seats while adding first class seats and main cabin extra seats. That’s going to be a tight cabin.

If there’s one time we can thank government regulation for customer experience it’s this: one additional row of seats would have pushed them over 200 and required an additional flight attendant. Indeed that may be why there’s an emphasis on adding seats with additional legroom.

The A321neo will be focused on West Coast flying. They’ll start with Phoenix – Hawaii and Los Angeles – Hawaii as well as Los Angeles-based cross country flights to destinations other than New York JFK. The airline tries to base a single aircraft type in a specific area, for instance the 737 MAX began in Miami. Other Airbus A321s, as they’re converted, will get assigned elsewhere."

The latest A321 for JetBlue is due to depart Mobile on 20 September with 15 percent sustainable jet fuel in its tanks.

In total, five A321 aircraft are due to be delivered to JetBlue from Mobile using sustainable fuel by the end of 2018. All of the fuel will be supplied and certified by Air BP. It will be loaded into the aircraft by Signature Flight Support, Airbus’ fueling services provider in Mobile.

Since May 2016, Airbus has offered customers the option of taking delivery of new aircraft from Toulouse, France, using a blend of sustainable jet fuel. Following the deliveries to JetBlue, Airbus will determine the next steps toward offering this option to more customers taking aircraft deliveries from Mobile. Longer term, Airbus envisions supporting the industrial production of sustainable fuels for aviation in the southeastern U.S.

“Our goal is to source sustainable fuels in the southeastern United States. It is an opportunity to work closely with local stakeholders to scale-up production and the commercialization of sustainable aviation fuels in the region,” said Frederic Eychenne, Head of New Energies at Airbus. “We are actively seeking ideas to leverage Airbus’ strategy into opportunities for new economic development in Alabama.”

“This is another example of JetBlue acknowledging that a sustainable future for aviation will require cooperation between all parts of the industry,” said Robin Hayes, Chief Executive Officer, JetBlue. “Renewable jet fuel affirms JetBlue’s belief that we can help define our industry’s future path. Our goal is to serve as a market-maker for renewable jet fuel, creating demand and therefore supporting supply. We’re working closely with Airbus to set up the infrastructure for more options in the southeast region.”

Air BP Chief Commercial Officer, Matt Elliott, added: “The airline industry has ambitious carbon reduction targets, which in a growing industry will only be achieved with support from across the entire supply chain. We are working closely with airlines and aircraft manufacturers, such as Airbus, to drive change by promoting and securing the supply of sustainable alternative jet fuel.”

“Signature Flight Support is proud to play a role supporting Airbus and JetBlue in their efforts to utilize sustainable fuels. BBA Aviation and Signature Flight Support are committed to reducing our impact on the environment and to the industry innovations that help to drive that effort,” stated Mark Johnstone, Chief Executive for BBA Aviation and CEO of Signature Flight Support, which also collaborates with Air BP to offer its business jet customers carbon neutral fuel by offsetting the emissions through the BP Target Neutral programme.

In another commitment to sustainability throughout the aircraft’s lifecycle, Airbus also announced its U.S. Manufacturing Facility in Mobile officially received its ISO14001 certification. ISO 14001 is a voluntary internationally recognised standard setting out the criteria for an environmental management system. The certificate covers activities, products and services of 20 sites across 7 countries, i.e. over 56,000 employees. Airbus was the first aircraft manufacturer to be certified ISO 14001 for all its sites, products and services.

KLM adjusts Airbus A350 delivery schedule - SamChui.com - Sam Chui,"Sat, 01 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vc2FtY2h1aS5jb20vMjAxOC8wOS8wMS9rbG0tYWRqdXN0cy1haXJidXMtYTM1MC1kZWxpdmVyeS1zY2hlZHVsZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"KLM adjusts Airbus A350 delivery schedule

KLM has announced that they have adjusted the delivery schedule for their Airbus A350-900s.

Instead of receiving the first in 2020, the airline has opted to push back the first delivery until 2021.

The Air France-KLM Group has a firm order for 28 Airbus A350-900s. Seven are destined for KLM, 10 are for low-cost carrier Joon and the remaining 11 are for Air France.

The group originally had 25 on order but has since converted two A380s to three A350-900s. 25 additional aircraft are also available as options.

Since the introduction of the type has been delayed, KLM has chosen to deploy its Boeing 747-400s for a little while longer. Expected retirement date is 2021 but the airline remains open to the fact that this could change.

Air France’s A340-300s are also set to be retired soon, with the final frame to be gone by the end of 2020.

This whole strategy is to reduce four-engine aircraft in the airline’s fleet and to modernize with two highly advanced aircraft consisting of the A350 and 787.

Although KLM is heavily focused on the environment and operating efficiency, the decision to wait longer and keep the remaining 747s longer means less money spent when its not required, which ties in with the company’s fleet development plan."

OPINION: How Airbus's Leahy succession plan misfired | Opinion | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Fri, 21 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9vcGluaW9uLWhvdy1haXJidXNzLWxlYWh5LXN1Y2Nlc3Npb24tcGxhbi1taXNmaXJlZC8xMjk1OTMuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It was never going to be easy for Airbus to replace its “billion-dollar salesman” John Leahy. And just eight months into its post-Leahy journey, Toulouse has already had to make unscheduled turnback.

While it may not have been a complete surprise to everyone, the announcement that Leahy’s replacement Eric Schulz was departing for personal reasons after eight months and being replaced by long-time Airbus man Christian Scherer raises many questions.

The decision to recruit Schulz from Rolls-Royce had provided Airbus with the opportunity to bring in an outsider untainted by the corruption allegations that have plagued it recently. But Scherer, with his long Airbus pedigree but current role on the periphery as head of subsidiary ATR, should arguably been top of the list to replace Leahy in the first place.

What is clear is that the European manufacturer’s management misfire comes as it still grapples with the problem of replacing the person at the very top – Tom Enders. The domineering leader – who is Scherer’s boss, as he was Schulz’s – steps down next year when his current term expires.

Schulz is the latest in a string of high-level departures from Airbus – some planned and some not. Airbus commercial aircraft chief Fabrice Bregier left about the same time as Leahy, earlier this year. Long viewed as Enders’ natural successor, Bregier decided to walk away as circumstances apparently changed.

Cue the arrival from Airbus Helicopters of ambitious company executive Guillaume Faury, who succeeded Bregier and presumably must be a candidate to replace Enders. Maybe Scherer will have other ideas?

Leahy’s deputy, Kiran Rao, was once tipped to take over, but that likelihood ended with the move to appoint an outsider.

But beyond any leadership power struggle, Scherer and his management colleagues must quickly address several burning issues that had already given Schulz a headache during his short tenure. One of these is the ongoing A320neo delays which are creating increasing frustration among customers. Another is the growing commercial pressure from Boeing, which has outsold Toulouse more than two-to-one so far this year and continues to dominate sales in the widebody market.

And there is one little fact from Schulz’s departure that won’t have been missed by Leahy: he remains the only Airbus sales chief to have ever sold an A380.

SpiceJet looking to purchase Airbus A330neo - SamChui.com - Sam Chui,"Sat, 29 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vc2FtY2h1aS5jb20vMjAxOC8wOS8yOS9zcGljZWpldC1sb29raW5nLXRvLXB1cmNoYXNlLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzMwbmVvL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SpiceJet looking to purchase Airbus A330neo

Indian low-cost carrier SpiceJet is reportedly holding discussions with Airbus to purchase the A330neo in order to perform future long-haul international flights to key destinations such as Europe.

Earlier this month, a team of six of Airbus’ top executives travelled to Gurugram, near Delhi, which is where the headquarters of SpiceJet is located. This is the second time that Airbus has sent their people down to the airline for talks according to people familiar with the situation.

No information has been released by Airbus or the airline about how many aircraft are being looked at or what model the order would consist of. Both of the companies have declined to comment when questioned by media outlets.

The A330neo comes in two variants: The A330-800 and A330-900 – both of which are intended to build on the success of the current A330. It was only the other day that Airbus received EASA certification for the A330-900, which is set to enter service with TAP Portugal in October. You can read about that here. 2018 Airbus list prices indicate the A330-800 starting at USD$260 million and the A330-900 at USD$296 million.

For a while now, SpiceJet has been pondering the idea of flying long-haul to big destinations such as Europe. The discussions between the airline and Airbus indicate they are nearing a potential announcement, not just for aircraft but for future fleet development and routes.

SpiceJet has a fleet consisting of 37 Boeing 737 Next Generation aircraft and 24 Bombardier Q400s. 155 737 MAXs as well as a further 24 Q400 NGs are on order. It’s worth noting that that the airline has purchase rights for an additional 50 Boeing aircraft that it can convert to the 787 Dreamliner, which rivals the A330 family.

Recently it was announced that IndiGo, India’s biggest airline, plans to purchase as many as 50 A330neo family aircraft. IndiGo is also developing plans for long-haul operations. Initially the 787 and A350 were on the table but have since been dropped for the A330neo according to people involved in the situation.

The large backlog of the 787 is likely a contributing factor to these decisions and discussions. It’s a great aircraft but it can’t be reached for many airlines within the next few years unless delivery slots open up or production is increased. The A330neo with its small backlog and commonality with the A320 family allows airlines to acquire of the jet quickly and easily.

As always, time will tell which airline goes for what and if these discussions are as detailed as they are outlined to be."

Air Baltic boss a driving force behind the Airbus A220 - Airline Ratings,"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Fpci1iYWx0aWMtYm9zcy1kcml2aW5nLWZvcmNlLWJlaGluZC1haXJidXMtMjIwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A big LED-lit sign on the roof proclaims “Home of Air Baltic”, and the interior of the headquarters of one of Europe’s most innovative airlines looks a bit like a start-up.

In Air baltic CEO Martin Gauss, who has led the flag carrier of Latvia for the past seven years, Bombardier and now Airbus have their biggest ally and product ambassador for what was the CSeries and now is branded the Airbus A220.

There has been no recent air show anywhere, be it in Dubai, Singapore or Farnborough, or major aviation gatherings like the IATA AGM or CAPA conferences in Sydney in June or the Aviation Festival in London in September where Gauss wouldn’t have been present to create awareness both for the aircraft and his airline in front of a global audience.

Gauss, now 50, became a Euro multi-millionaire in his 30s when he sold his stake of 10% in former Deutsche BA to Air Berlin. He has always been one of the most avid supporters of what is currently the most modern airliner.

Gauss excels at air shows leading industry visitors through the A220-300 of which Air Baltic currently operates 11 out of an order of 50 firm plus 30 options.

In his office in Riga, he has set up an impressive display – 80 tiny A220 aircraft models in 1:500 scale, exactly the number his airline wants to operate by 2025.

Even counting only current firm orders Air Baltic ranks second worldwide after US giant Delta Air Lines (receiving its first in late 2019) in the number of A220 commitments.

In May 2018, shortly before it was re-branded as A220, Air Baltic placed a huge order for 60 further aircraft, on top of 20 already in the books, 30 firm and 30 options.

Counting list prices puts the firm order has a value of about US$3bn, the biggest investment overall in the history of Latvia, a former Soviet rep[ublic which became independent in 1991 and is an EU member state.

Gauss, who still holds a Boeing 737 pilot license and started as a first officer at Deutsche BA, got hooked on the CSeries early.

READ: Airbus, Bombardier tie-up adds A220 to impressive portfolio.

In 2012, when the industry was skeptical if the concept would ever take off, he ordered ten CS300s for Air Baltic, reportedly at rock-bottom prices.

He faced harsh criticism both from his native Germany and from France for not buying Airbus aircraft.

“I got into great trouble, even German politicians came to Riga to tell the government it was unacceptable that a Latvian state carrier buys Canadian aircraft in bulk,” he says.

But Gauss has stuck by his belief, observing: “This aircraft is a big success because there is nothing better in the 150-seater market and there won’t be at least for the next decade.”

Over 1.5 million of his passengers have flown the A220 so far and customer feedback is hugely positive compared to what it used to be. Air Baltic still also operates eleven older Boeing 737s and twelve Q400 turboprops, which all will be phased out by 2022 to be replaced with a pure A220 fleet.

But why is he as an airline CEO investing so much time and effort to promote an aircraft type?

“We want to do sale and leaseback deals with a part of our fleet and for that, the aircraft must be well known, well liked and have a strong market presence,” Gauss says.

So far 41 A220s have been delivered to Swiss, the launch operator, Air Baltic and Korean Air. The current order book stands at a mere 402 but Airbus believes it could sell about 3,000 A220s in the coming years, thanks to its much more efficient supplier network and more effective sales force.

Gauss is not officially part of this but believes his efforts have already started to pay off for his airline’s brand, the awareness of the aircraft and its market value.

“The switch from Bombardier to Airbus can be felt already in the level of acceptance on the leasing market, as part of the Airbus portfolio the aircraft now has an acceptance there that wasn’t existing before,’’ he notes.

“One can assume that there will be more orders in the future, and that would help us as the launch operator of the A220-300 as it would make our aircraft more valuable, the more are built the more value they have.”

Air Baltic, which introduced the first of the then CS300 in December 2016, has been in an upward mode for recent years after a near-bankruptcy early in the decade. It has been profitable since 2013 and 2018 is expected to become another record year, which will see passenger numbers climb to 4 million.

While mainly operating to about 70 destinations from Riga all over Europe Air Baltic started to serve more far-flung cities recently.

There is a seasonal route from Riga to Abu Dhabi, taking over six hours flight time westbound on the A220, and recently a new route to Almaty in Kazakhstan, almost as far from Riga.

“It’s our strategy to enable passengers to get to Riga from anywhere in the world with just one stop”, explains Gauss, “not so much to raise the number of passengers but to ensure connectivity for the Baltic states.”

There are three Baltic states, including Lithuania and Estonia, with a total population of six million people.

In order to raise extra capital for its expansion plans Air Baltic is currently searching for a strategic investor.

Both the Latvian state, currently holding 80 percent of the airline, as well as a private Danish investor, a leasing company holding 20%, would be willing to sell shares.

One of the participating banks has already praised Air Baltic’s “world-class management”."

Emirates Flight EK203 was quarantined at New York's JFK International Airport after numerous passengers reportedly fell ill on board.

The exact number of passengers and crew that became sick during the flight remains in controversy.

According to the CDC, about 100 passengers and crew fell ill with 11 needing hospitalization. However, Emirates told Business Insider that their count was 19.

EK203 landed at New York's JFK International Airport just after 9 a.m. Wednesday following a 14-hour flight from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

The aircraft returned to service Wednesday afternoon as Flight EK204 to Dubai.

Emirates Flight EK203 was quarantined at New York's JFK International Airport after numerous passengers reportedly fell ill on board.

The exact number of passengers and crew that became sick during the flight remains in controversy.

In a statement to Business Insider, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that ""approximately 100 passengers, including some crew on the flight, complained of illness,"" but later amended their statement to say that 11 passengers were taken to local hospitals. The exact reason for this significant discrepancy remains unclear.

Emirates initially said the number of sick passengers was about 10, but later upped that figure to 19 people including seven members of the crew.

In an updated statement to Business Insider, the airline confirmed that three passengers and seven crew were transferred to the hospital for further medical care and evaluation. In addition, nine other passengers received additional medical screening at ""a site near the aircraft"" but were later released, Emirates said.

The cause of the illness remains a mystery. According to the CDC, passengers and crew reported symptoms including cough, fever, and gastrointestinal illness.

The Emirates flight, an Airbus A380 Superjumbo, landed in New York at 9:18 a.m. on Wednesday after a 14-hour trip from Dubai. Pictures posted on social media by passengers show the plane at a remote stand surrounded by an armada of ambulances and emergency response vehicles. The CDC confirmed that there were 549 passengers and crew on board.

Story continues

Both the CDC and the airline confirmed that all passengers were evaluated by health officials prior to being let off the plane.

""We are requesting the passengers who have been evaluated and released to call their provider and health department if they develop any symptoms, and to give their travel history and report of the incident,"" the CDC said in a statement. ""They may receive a follow-up call from their health department just as a check-in.""

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the organization operating the airport, was not immediately available for comment.

The aircraft involved in the incident, registration number A6-EUF, returned to service Wednesday afternoon as Emirates Flight EK204 to Dubai.

Passengers on the flight offered their perspective on the incident through social media. Oddly, this included '90s rapper Vanilla Ice, who claims to have been a passenger on the plane's upper deck.

Airbus A330-900 certified by EASA - Airline Ratings,"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzMwLTkwMC1jZXJ0aWZpZWQtZWFzYS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A330-900 has received its type certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency ahead of the delivery of the first aircraft to TAP Air Portugal in coming weeks.

TAP’s aircraft served as a demonstrator during a global tour and joined two flight test aircraft in a certification program involving about 1400 flight test hours since the type first flew on October 17, 2017.

Airbus expects the corresponding certification from the US Federal Aviation Administration to follow soon.

Powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, Airbus claims the A330-900 has the lowest seat-mile cost in the 300-seater range.

The European manufacturer says the efficient Trent 7000s, a new optimized wing with new sharklets and the use of lighter composite materials bring a reduction in fuel consumption of 25 percent compared with older generation aircraft of similar size.

It also benefits from a common pilot rating with the A350 XWB and new data connectivity features aimed at helping operators predict potential issues before they become a problem.

The TAP aircraft will feature the Airspace by Airbus cabin with newly designed sidewalls and fixtures, larger overhead storage, advanced cabin mood lighting and the latest in-flight entertainment and connectivity.

Launched in July 2014, the neo is a refinement of the popular A330 in service since 1994.

READ Airbus A330neo takes off in turbulent times.

Airbus has offered A330neo in two versions with 99 percent commonality, the A330-800, due to make its first flight in coming weeks, and A330-900.

The manufacturer has 224 firm orders for the -900 but the future of the A330-800 is in doubt after its sole customer, Hawaiian Airlines, canceled its order for six aircraft in favor of Boeing’s 787-9 Dreamliner.

Airbus also lost a campaign to sell the A330neo to American Airlines after it was unwilling to match the price Boeing offered.

However, AirAsia reconfirmed its commitment to 66 of the A330neo at this year’s Farnborough Air Show and placed an order for an additional 34, rounding up to an even 100.

Former Airbus chief commercial officer Eric Schulz conceded on the sidelines of June’s International Air Transport Association conference in Sydney that the route proving was when the rubber hit the road.

“And so far we are extremely satisfied with the performance of the plane .. after the first phase of flight tests,” he said. “In terms of delivery, we are working very closely with TAP but we are within the last delivery dates we made public before so there is no change.

“If anything the program is doing quite well now.”

On the question of demand, Schulz acknowledged Airbus had suffered two defeats in a row with Hawaiian and American and the losses were unfortunate.

“In this particular case, I am not particularly anxious about the future of the 330neo,” he said. “Just here over the last three days I’ve seen many, many customers very interested about the neo and we have deals in process.

“I am quite hopeful that we will continue to find our place in the market.”"

The comfort of an Air France superjumbo

Stepping on board an Air France Airbus A380 means the guarantee of an exceptional trip. On board, the 516 passengers enjoy optimal travel comfort and exceptional facilities. 220 windows fill the cabin with natural light, and changing lighting moods allow you to cross time zones without feeling tired. In addition, six bars throughout the aircraft allow passengers to meet up during the flight. As the cabin is five decibels quieter than industry standards, the A380 is a particularly quiet aircraft. It features the latest technologies in terms of entertainment and comfort. External images are broadcast live throughout the flight using three cameras located at the front, bottom and rear of the aircraft.

Today, Air France’s 10 Airbus A380s already fly to 8 other destinations: Abidjan in Côte d’Ivoire, Johannesburg in South Africa, New York-JFK, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington in the United States, Mexico City in Mexico and Shanghai in China."

“Swiss Skies” is looking for investors for Airbus A321LR flights from EuroAirport Basel to the ... - Aviation24.be,"Mon, 10 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdmlhdGlvbjI0LmJlL2FpcmxpbmVzL3N3aXNzLXNraWVzLWlzLWxvb2tpbmctZm9yLWludmVzdG9ycy1mb3ItYWlyYnVzLWEzMjFsci1mbGlnaHRzLWZyb20tZXVyb2FpcnBvcnQtYmFzZWwtdG8tdGhlLXVzLWFuZC10aGUtd29ybGQv0gGVAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF2aWF0aW9uMjQuYmUvYWlybGluZXMvc3dpc3Mtc2tpZXMtaXMtbG9va2luZy1mb3ItaW52ZXN0b3JzLWZvci1haXJidXMtYTMyMWxyLWZsaWdodHMtZnJvbS1ldXJvYWlycG9ydC1iYXNlbC10by10aGUtdXMtYW5kLXRoZS13b3JsZC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A Ryanair pilot and a former top manager of Air Berlin are laying the foundation for a new budget airline at EuroAirport Basel. “Swiss Skies” wants to undercut ticket prices on Swiss long-haul flights by 30 percent. The founders are seeking $100 million as initial capital from investors.

Armin Bovensiepen has already seen a few airlines from inside. The manager worked for Lufthansa and Air Berlin flight operations, and most recently as Sales Director of Niki. Together with Ryanair pilot Alvaro Oliveira and two other friends, Bovensiepen is now attacking SWISS.

“Swiss Skies” – a preliminary project name – intends to offer flights to the United States from Swiss airport Basel-Mulhouse in mid-2019. Plans for a “complete network” have already been worked out, Bovensiepen told The Financial Times.

Initially, he would start with a connection to Ohio, because Basel and Cincinnati both have a strong pharmaceutical industry – but no airline is serving their potential demand for non-stop flights. “If someone wants to travel from Cincinnati to Basel, it’s a nightmare,” said Oliveira.

The business plan envisages the rapid development of an Airbus A321LR fleet. As a 190-seater, the compact long-haul Airbus aircraft would also reach destinations in Asia, the Middle East, the Caribbean and Brazil for “Swiss Skies”. In the second year of operation, the airline wants to have 16 A321LRs, in the fourth year already over 38 aircraft.

“Swiss Skies” wants to sell its flights 30 percent cheaper than the competition of legacy airlines and in the third year of operation already be in the black figures.

Headwind could come from the Lufthansa subsidiary SWISS. “We are testing a possible range of destinations for the A321LR“, SWISS CEO Thomas Klühr indicated in 2017 in newspaper “SonntagsBlick” as an entry into the market of thin long-haul routes.

Meanwhile, the Lufthansa Group is also feeling the breath of discount airlines on the long-haul market. Just last week Primera Air announced for 2019 a deployment of Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft in Berlin and Frankfurt for long-haul low-cost flights to North America."

SARASOTA — The revolutionary record-smashing Perlan 2 glider did it again over Argentina last Sunday when the spindly-looking craft flew higher than the Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance plane.

Perlan 2, Airbus’ celebrated experimental sailplane, topped 76,100 feet to set a record for an aircraft without an engine. That topped the U-2 altitude mark of 73,700 feet recorded in 1989. It was also the third time within a week the pressurized glider soared into the record books. It shattered its own 2017 high-flight mark on August 26 at 62,000 feet, cleared 67,500 feet two days later, then beat that record by nearly 10,000 feet on Sunday.

Sarasota flight test engineer Miguel Iturmendi was riding with chief pilot Jim Payne on the August 28 mission. Payne was at the controls again, along with crewmate Tim Gardner, during the historic Labor Day weekend flight.

Taking advantage of a seasonally brief meteorological phenomenon involving westerly Pacific winds fusing with cyclonic upper level currents known as the polar vortex, the Airbus team is gunning for 90,000 feet. It began testing Perlan 2’s design boundaries against those Andean winds in 2016.

“We will not try to reach 90,000 feet until next year,” Iturmendi stated in an email from the staging area in El Calafate, Argentina. “75,000 feet was the max altitude planned for this season. Each year we push a little further in steps. In my flight the max planned altitude was 70,000 feet, for (Sunday’s) flight (it) was 76,000 feet max for the flight and this 2018 season.”

Airbus will wrap up operations in El Calafate for the season on September 15.

Among the most keenly interested observers of these high-flight exploits is Sarasota’s Larry “Kimo” Rider, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who became a glider instructor at the Air Force Academy following his combat tour of Vietnam.

“I saw it coming in 1973,” recalls Rider, whose students have included the likes of Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger and Hubble Space Telescope astronaut repairman Story Musgrave. “Jim (Payne) was a young cadet at the Academy, maybe 19, 20 years old, when he came up to me one day and said I want to set the world altitude glide record. I knew he would do it — Jim is absolutely driven toward this project.”

Payne graduated as Outstanding Cadet in Soaring in 1974 and has since gone on to amass numerous aviation records for speed and distance, and has been inducted into the Soaring Hall of Fame.

Rider says glider training produces better pilots because the lack of an engine gives aviators a better intuitive feel for environmental conditions. “An engine will let you do whatever you want to do,” he says, “but in a glider, you have to make it do what you want to do.”

Payne’s record-setting climb took roughly five hours to make after a specially modified tow plane released the glider at 43,000 feet, where the troposphere yields to the stratosphere. The unique confluence of Pacific pressure waves with polar winds create thrust that can push well over 100,000 feet above sea level.

The record altitude achieved by an American motorized aircraft was set in 1976 when an SR-71 peaked at 85,069 feet. The altitude mark for a jet aircraft was logged in 1977 when a MiG-25 reached 123,520 feet."

Airbus-Canada partnership can build a bright future off a storied past - The Globe and Mail,"Thu, 06 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdsb2JlYW5kbWFpbC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvY29tbWVudGFyeS9hcnRpY2xlLWFpcmJ1cy1jYW5hZGEtcGFydG5lcnNoaXAtY2FuLWJ1aWxkLWEtYnJpZ2h0LWZ1dHVyZS1vZmYtYS1zdG9yaWVkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tom Enders is CEO of Airbus

Canada has a great history of innovation in aerospace – and this country looks set to continue building on that legacy. Airbus aims to be a key partner in Canada’s successful aviation future.

We can do that vital work together because both Airbus and Canada believe in global trade, international co-operation and environmental excellence.

Canadians brought the world one of the first passenger jet airliners ever to fly (the Avro C102 Jetliner in 1949, from which the word “jetliner” entered our vocabulary); launched one of the earliest satellites sent into space (Alouette 1 in 1962); and revolutionized air transportation in smaller cities (with the Canadair Regional Jet). So, there is no doubt – Canada’s history and expertise in aerospace run deep.

Joining that proud list is the truly innovative aircraft developed by Bombardier in Quebec as the C Series – now a new and vital part of the Airbus family as the A220-100 and A220-300. These remarkable aircraft, specifically designed for the 130- to 160-seat market, deliver lower fuel burn, half the noise footprint and decreased emissions – making them true community-minded jetliners.

The market for smaller single-aisle jets is projected to be about 7,000 over the next 20 years, and the A220 has all the credentials it needs to take the lion’s share of that. This is why Airbus has already made and will continue to make considerable investments in this vital, Canada-led program.

Canada has everything necessary to continue to develop its aerospace industry as an engine for future economic growth: a rich pool of existing talent and experience, a dynamic education system that continues to feed that talent pool, a strong supplier network to support all aspects of the industry and a research ecosystem that fuels innovation.

As Al Power of aerospace manufacturer Precision Castparts Corp. put it in a Globe and Mail article last month, there are strong arguments for Canada to look more toward aerospace for economic growth than other more uncertain industries. We see that happening – most recently in this month’s announcement of support by the Quebec and federal governments to Montreal-based CAE, another great Canadian enterprise, to harness new technologies to develop the next generation of aerospace simulation and training products.

Airbus, like CAE, is committed to Canada’s leading role in the aerospace industry of tomorrow – one that is and will remain (despite current nationalistic pressures) a truly global business. Even before the A220 partnership, Airbus – with its more than 1,000 employees and 35-year history in Canada, including our Fort Erie, Ont., helicopter manufacturing facility – was working and spending billions of dollars with more than 600 Canadian suppliers in nine provinces.

Look for this to increase, with the 12,500 direct and indirect jobs supported by the A220 partnership. We also see strong growth potential for our helicopter business as well as space and defence, the latter highlighted by our most recent contract to supply new fixed-wing search-and-rescue aircraft to the Canadian Armed Forces.

This growth in Canada is one reason why the annual Airbus global supplier conference will take place in Montreal this fall. It is an opportunity to showcase the aviation ecosystem that already exists in this country – and to help create new partnerships and opportunities for Canadian ingenuity on a global scale.

Aviation and aerospace are crucial growth and prosperity drivers for the future. Airbus and Canada, by continuing to work and innovate together, will make it fly."

A fake video on the Beijing Capital Airlines Airbus A320 accident has reached 10M views on Facebook - Aviation24.be,"Sun, 16 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF2aWF0aW9uMjQuYmUvd2Vic2l0ZS9mYWNlYm9vay9mYWtlLXZpZGVvLWJlaWppbmctY2FwaXRhbC1haXJsaW5lcy1haXJidXMtYTMyMC1hY2NpZGVudC1yZWFjaGVkLTZtLXZpZXdzLWZhY2Vib29rL9IBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdmlhdGlvbjI0LmJlL3dlYnNpdGUvZmFjZWJvb2svZmFrZS12aWRlby1iZWlqaW5nLWNhcGl0YWwtYWlybGluZXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjAtYWNjaWRlbnQtcmVhY2hlZC02bS12aWV3cy1mYWNlYm9vay9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On 13 September, Facebook page Time News International misused the scare on typhoon Mangkhut and released a partly fake video on something that occurred already on 28 August. (Beijing Capital Airlines Airbus A320 substantially damaged after hard landing at Macau Airport). The description is also completely wrong, but the video is going viral: shared already 138,000 times and quickly reaching 10,000,000 views. In five steps, Aviation24.be will explain that this video is completely fake news!

Video that appeared on Facebook and a copy on YouTube.

1. Time News International isn’t a news agency, only a page on Facebook

Time News International is just a Facebook page, they don’t have a website! They do have 205,000 followers though (grown 10,000 in the last 24 hours). On their info-page: “Welcome to Time News International on Facebook, for the stories that matter to you and All Topics of the World Discussion and Opinion on Daily World News.”

2. The video starts with a dramatic scene, taken from a clip from an animation company

3. The Facebook page is confusing two airlines: Dragon Air and Beijing Capital Airlines

Cathay Dragon is a Hong Kong-based international regional airline, previously known as Dragonair but they rebranded in 2016. Beijing Capital Airlines is a Chinese low-cost airline based in Beijing Capital International Airport. It is a subsidiary of Hainan Airlines.

4. The accident has nothing to do with typhoon Mangkhut

The accident has nothing to do with typhoon Mangkhut as it already happened on 28 August, more than two weeks ago!

5. Reproduce part of the original article published on Aviation24.be and spread fake news

Copy/paste this text: “Beijing Capital Airlines confirmed the accident, in total, there were 166 passengers and 9 crew members on board. After the landing at Shenzhen Airport an emergency evacuation was initiated, five of the passengers were slightly injured (most likely during the emergency evacuation).” and add it to your Facebook post."
