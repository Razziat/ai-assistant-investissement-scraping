Who Has Wider Seats: the Airbus A320 or the Boeing 737? - Airline Reporter,"Wed, 17 Nov 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMC8xMS93aG8taGFzLXdpZGVyLXNlYXRzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIwLW9yLWJvZWluZy03Mzcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus versus Boeing. Who doesn’t love a good competition between the world’s two largest commercial airline manufactures? I try to say I am not slanted one way or another, but living 15 minutes away from where most Boeing aircraft are made might make me a bit biased. The saying around these parts, “If it isn’t Boeing, I am not going,” is pretty popular. I actually know a few people who honestly will not fly an Airbus or Boeing product just on principle. I don’t go that far.

Anyhow one of the constant “this manufacture is better,” arguments I hear is that the Airbus A320 seats are so much wider than the B0eing 737s. I figured it was time to find out. I took a look at airlines from around the world that fly both aircraft and used SeatGuru.com to find out the width of each seat.

I wanted to check the accuracy of the information SeatGuru has on their site, so I spoke with Jami Counter, Senior director of the site and he stated, “SeatGuru’s content team utilizes flyer comments to maintain the accuracy of our airplane seat information and updates the site with both user-submitted reviews and independent research.” That being said, I am by no means saying this is 100% scientific, but I think it can give a good comparison between the two.

Both the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 families have the same width no matter what model they might be (ie a Boeing 737-200 is just as wide as a -900). Airbus starts out ahead with a fuselage width of 156″ and a cabin width of 146″. The Boeing 737 is a bit smaller with a 148″ fuselage and only 139″ in the cabin. This means that the Airbus A320 has 7 more inches of width than the Boeing 737. If an airline did things right, each seat and the aisle could have 1″ more width than the 737.

I took a look at airlines running the Boeing 737 and/or the Airbus A320. I compared both the standard economy seating and also premium seating (some airlines call it first class, business, etc). The economy is shown with an “E” and premium with a “P.” If an airline had multiple seat widths in the same category, I averaged them together. Here are my results in inches:

On average, the Airbus A320 seats are wider, but not by much. Only about 1/2″ in economy and almost no difference with premium seats. It seems that airlines and seat manufactures are not using that extra 7″ of cabin width that the Airbus A320 provides.

When I asked Counter from SeatGuru about his thoughts, he told me, “While the A320 does have a wider diameter fuselage, it doesn’t necessarily mean that airlines will put in a significantly wider seat.” He also took a look at the data they have on their site and came to a similar conclusion that the A320 will have slightly more width on average. “On SeatGuru we’ve found that while there is some variation, we generally see airlines give about 17-17.2″ seat width in coach on a B737, while they give about 17.5″-18″ seat width in coach on an A320. These differences depend on the types of seats airlines use, as well as the overall seating configuration of the aircraft. ”

Is it worth making an effort to fly on a Airbus A320 for more room? I am going to say no. I know that many people have a preference of aircraft type they fly on and I am assuming that fractions of an inch isn’t going to persuade a person one way or another. However, airline loyalist have always surprised me in the past. Does this information change your views on flying on either the Boeing 737 or Airbus A320?

Rolls-Royce to Replace Engines of Superjumbo Airbus Jets - Voice of America - VOA News,"Sun, 14 Nov 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtZW5naW5lcy1tYXktbmVlZC1yZXBsYWNlbWVudC0tMTA4MTg4MzY5LzE2ODkyNy5odG1s0gFbaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm9hbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLWVuZ2luZXMtbWF5LW5lZWQtcmVwbGFjZW1lbnQtLTEwODE4ODM2OS8xNjg5MjcuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Associated Press reports Monday that Rolls-Royce will temporarily replace entire engines on A380 Superjumbo jets, after an oil leak in an engine earlier this month caused a fire in the engine and a catastrophic failure.

British jet-engine maker Rolls-Royce would not comment on the report that it would swap out entire engines on A380 Superjumbo jets.



The company said it stands by its earlier statement that an engine fire in a QANTAS airliner was caused by a specific component in the turbine area, but declined to name the component. Industry analyst Howard Wheeldon said swapping out engines could take some time.



""It suggests that this is a three, six or maybe nine-month job to get these aircraft back in the air as opposed to and earlier hope that if could be just a few weeks,"" said Wheeldon.



Qantas has grounded its six A380s, after finding oil leaks in three of them. A QANTAS spokesman called its approach conservative. Wheeldon agrees.



""Perfectly understandable that QANTAS should want answers to what is still an unexplained problem, and to ensure that the engines in service in the future will not come up against a similar problem.""



Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa checked their planes and returned all but one to service. Wheeldon said that was a logical decision. ""We must remember that this was not a crash, this was an incident where one engine failed, there are three others, this aircraft can fly on two engines. Now obviously one does not want to see an incident like this, but the company [has] got to the bottom of it very quickly.""



This report, though, spells bad financial news for Rolls-Royce, said Wheeldon.



""Clearly the stock has already suffered, it came back on a positive front Friday after the announcement. I think we are going to see some drift here until the day comes that they can tell us that this is firmly behind them.""



A Rolls-Royce would not comment on how long repairs would take, as it would depend on how a specific airline wanted repairs to proceed. The company also would not comment on whether this would delay delivery of A380s expected to go into service in 2011."

The A380 super jumbo is designed to be able to carry on flying with only three engines [EPA]

The double-decker Airbus A380, the world’s largest passenger plane, was built to revolutionise air travel.

The aircraft made its maiden flight in 2005, and its first commercial flight by Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Sydney, two years later.

Its wingspan is 79.75 metres and its wing area is 845 square metres, enough to park 72 medium-sized cars on each wing.

It has 50 per cent more floor space than the next biggest aircraft, the Boeing 747 jumbo and it is 24.45 metres high, about the same height as a seven storey building.

It can carry 853 passengers in an all-economy configuration, but most airlines fly around 550 passengers in first, business and economy classes.

The project to develop the aircraft was delayed 18 months in 2006 when it was discovered that wiring prepared in Hamburg, Germany, did not fit planes being assembled in Toulouse, France, due to incompatible software.

This snag in the development process cost Airbus an additional six billion dollars.

The A380 has 530 kilometres of wiring, roughly equivalent to the distance between Frankfurt and Paris.

The aircraft can be fitted with two types of engines: Rolls-Royce Trent 900 and Engine Alliance GP7000 turbofans.

The Qantas A380 of flight QF32 is powered by four Rolls-Royce trent 900 engines built in Britain.

Airbus said in June 2010 it had 234 confirmed orders for the A380 from 17 customers.

Qantas is the second biggest customer with 20 aircraft on order. Emirates is by far the biggest, with 90 aircraft on order.

There are 37 of the aircraft currently in operation. Other airlines who have taken delivery are Lufthansa and Air France.

In September 2009, a Singapore Airlines A380 was forced to turn around in mid-flight and head back to Paris after one of its four engines failed; however, the super jumbo is designed to be able to carry on flying with only three engines."
Qantas Airbus 380 uncontained engine failure - The Aviationist,"Thu, 04 Nov 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlYXZpYXRpb25pc3QuY29tLzIwMTAvMTEvMDQvcWFudGFzLWFpcmJ1cy0zODAtdW5jb250YWluZWQtZW5naW5lLWZhaWx1cmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Two months ago, commenting about the uncontained engine failure involving the Qantas B747-400 just departed from San Francisco (for details read here) I wrote: “Unlike other minor failures occuring almost daily everywhere, an uncontained failure (that is quite different from an engine explosion….), is somehow rare, but not a big deal (if there’s no damage to the wing or fuselage caused by a separated engine part), especially if happening in the vicinity of the departure airport”. What happened to QF32, an Airbus A380 from Singapore to Sydney somehow prov e that such kind of emergency is not as rare at least for Qantas aircraft…. On Nov. 4, 2010, Airbus 380 “VH-OQA”, the first A380-800 flying with Qantas, with 433 passengers and 26 crew members on board, experienced an uncontained engine failure 30 minutes after departure from Singapore and was compelled to return to Changi airport where it performed a successful emergency landing after circling above the sea for fuel dumping. Parts from the #2 engine punctured the left wing while debris fell on the ground (fortunately, nobody was hurt). Even if the cause of the failure is obviously still unknown, as a consequence of the engine problem Qantas grounded its seven Airbus 380s, to be followed, according to rumors, by the Singapore and Lufthansa ones in the next few h ours (Qantas, Singarpore and Lufthansa A380s are equipped with the Rolls Royce Trent 900 variant power plant – while Air France and Emirates are powered by Engine Alliance GP7200 engines). Since I’ve not heard latelyabout similar events involving aircraft of other airlines, what happened to QF32 raises a question: what’s wrong in the Rolls Royce – Qantas duo? Perhaps nothing. Perhaps Qantas planes with Rolls Royce engines had just bad luck but investigation will have to analyse also airline’s maintenance procedures as well as engine design and type of material used to build engine components at RR.

So, what have we learnt so far from this event?

1) engine failures happens (on 4 engine aircraft but also on 2 or 3 engine planes – the number of engines is statistically irrelevant)

2) uncontained engine failures are not so dangerous, provided they don’t cause damages to the wing or fuselage

3) in the last two occurrences, the “uncontainment” happened few minutes after departure (hence, in such a phase of flight in which stress on engine is at the highest level)

4) aircraft experiencing this type of emergency can return to the departure aerodrome safely

5) this was the most serious incident worldwide involving an A380 since it entered service three years ago

6) aircraft parts sometimes fall from the sky (as in Donnie Darko movie….) so be careful :)

Rolls-Royce announced Thursday that they are to replace as many as 40 engines across the Airbus A380 fleet of passenger aircraft, following safety fears sparked by a mid-air explosion on board a Singapore Airlines flight earlier this month.

AFP - Rolls-Royce may replace up to 40 engines on Airbus A380 superjumbos flown by three airlines, Qantas said Thursday, after a mid-air explosion sparked safety fears over the world's biggest passenger jet.

The number accounts for nearly half the Trent 900 engines powering A380s operated by Qantas, Singapore Airlines and Germany's Lufthansa, and follows extensive checks after the November 4 blast over Indonesia.

""Rolls may have to look at replacing up to 40 engines across the entire A380 fleet,"" a Qantas spokeswoman told AFP.

""That includes the Singapore fleet and the Lufthansa fleet. Obviously Qantas doesn't have 40 engines to replace, we only have six aircraft with four engines each,"" she added.

Qantas chief Alan Joyce said that up to 14 of the airline's A380 engines could potentially need to be replaced, leaving it unclear when its fleet of A380s will resume flying their routes to Los Angeles and London.

Rolls-Royce had already been in the process of modifying the engines to prevent oil leaks, but none of Qantas's turbines had been updated, Joyce said.

Australia's national carrier grounded all six of its A380s following the explosion, which forced an emergency landing in Singapore. Qantas earlier said it will need at least three new engines after safety checks found oil leaks.

Singapore Airlines has grounded three of its 11 A380s and Lufthansa is changing an engine on one of its three superjumbos as a precaution, while other A380 operators use turbines made by different manufacturers.

""Rolls-Royce are still working through the criteria for which engines need to be changed,"" Joyce told reporters.

""We're hoping to understand precisely which engines need to be replaced and therefore we can have a firm timeline for when they will be back in the air, but we are still a few days away from that,"" he added.

Joyce said the British manufacturer had modified the Trent 900 engine to stop oil leaks before the blast and ""if this incident hadn't occurred, eventually all these engines would have had this modification"".

""It doesn't look like it is a significant modification, but it is a modification that has an impact on how the engines are performing,"" he said.

""If this was significant, and was known to be significant, we would have liked to have known about that,"" he added.

Qantas would discuss compensation for disruptions to its schedule with Rolls-Royce once the A380s returned to service, Joyce said. Rolls-Royce was not immediately available to respond to the latest comments.

Rolls-Royce has pinpointed a ""specific component"" in the Trent 900 as the cause of an oil fire behind the November 4 blast. Each A380 is powered by four engines.

The Qantas spokeswoman said she was unable to give a ""definitive answer"" on when its Airbus superjumbo would return to the skies, refusing to confirm a report which said it could remain out of action until at least early December.

A new-for-old engine swap programme was among options being discussed with Rolls-Royce to speed up the resumption of A380 services, she added.

Joyce said the A380 issues had reduced Qantas's flying capacity by between four and five percent.

The double-decker A380, which carries 525 passengers and weighs 560 tonnes at takeoff, was hailed as the future of long-haul aviation at its commercial launch in 2007.

Rival manufacturer Boeing's Dreamliner is about three years behind schedule after a series of glitches, including an on-board fire last week which forced it to cancel test flights.

Airbus A350 XWB update - Reinforced Plastics,"Tue, 16 Nov 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlaW5mb3JjZWRwbGFzdGljcy5jb20vY29udGVudC9mZWF0dXJlcy9haXJidXMtYTM1MC14d2ItdXBkYXRlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A350 XWB (extra wide body), the aircraft that Airbus Industrie did not want to build, is now visibly taking shape, propelled by fully committed engineering and management teams within Airbus itself and throughout its supply chain. George Marsh reviews the project so far.

In September, Airbus flight tested an A350 XWB fuselage panel made from CFRP. The 15 m² structure was fitted in place of an existing A340 aluminium fuselage section. The trials was designed to evaluate acoustic properties and to help fine-tune sound insulation for the A350 XWB cabin. (Picture © Airbus.)

A350 XWB fuselage material choice.

In responding to Boeing’s radical B787 Dreamliner, Airbus first hoped it could get away with an upgraded development of its established A330 twin, but this concept cut little ice with potential customers so the European company had to think again. Ultimately, it put forward an altogether new aircraft, gaining competitive edge by giving it a wider fuselage than that of the B787 (hence ‘XWB’).

Airbus leaders had to backtrack on their previous assertions that Boeing was foolish to adopt a reinforced plastic fuselage for its Dreamliner. Plastic fuselages are an undoubted challenge because previous commercial passenger jet fuselages have been metal and no-one knew how best to fabricate a large composite pressure vessel that has to accommodate hundreds of passengers. Nor was it clear how such a plastic fuselage would behave in service. Unknowns range from the likely effects of fatigue on a structure subject to repeated thermal and pressure cycles, to detection of damage in composites and subsequent repairability.

Yet, stung by Boeing’s bold adoption of a predominantly composite airframe, including the fuselage, Airbus has followed suit, notably specifying reinforced plastics for its wide ovoid fuselage as well as wings, empennage and other primary aerostructure. In fact, the billed 53% composite content of the A350 slightly trumps the 50% of the B787. The European contender is 53% composite, 19% aluminium-lithium, 14% titanium, 6% steel and 8% other materials.

Of course, operators are not interested in competition around plastic content for its own sake, but are keen to have the weight and performance benefits that composites can bring. Reassured that Airbus has recovered from its wrong-footing by Boeing, 35 customers have (at time of writing) ordered 573 A350 XWBs. (Airbus claims this number of firm orders and another 80 commitments.) Something around 600 copies is a creditable tally given that the aircraft was officially launched in 2006, more than three years after the B787.

Composites advantage

Airbus believes it has advantages in the composites arena. For a start, while Boeing has had to make a large jump from barely 10% composites content in its B777 airliner to the B787’s 50% figure, Airbus was an early composites adopter and has gained expertise while progressively adding fairings, nacelles, empennages, control surfaces and wings to its composite structures portfolio. It now has extensive experience of reinforced plastics fabrication and service behaviour, while composites engineers on the A350 programme benefit also from the 15% plastic content in the Airbus A380 ‘superjumbo’. Admittedly, Airbus might still have preferred to maintain its more incremental approach to composites adoption but, goaded by its competitor, it is now fully committed to the plastic fuselage revolution. Although low-weight metal solutions, primarily aluminium/lithium alloy and metal/composite hybrids such as GLARE, were considered, composites won out because of the prospects for greater integration, fewer parts and fasteners, lower maintenance and, it seems, the favourable attitude of airlines to the precedent set by Boeing.

Paradoxically, the European planemaker gains from not being the leader in this particular airframe race since it can learn much from the problems experienced by Boeing that have led to a likely three-year delay in first deliveries of B787s. Although the A350 programme is facing delays of its own, so far these are of the order of months rather than years. With first deliveries and service entry likely in 2014, the new Airbus should not be nearly as far behind its competitor in terms of its availability as was once anticipated.

Broadly, the A350 family will comprise three aircraft sizes; the A350-800, A350-900 and A350-1000 designed variously to carry 270 to 350 passengers (up to 400+ in the highest-density configuration). The aircraft was conceived as an A330/340 replacement and will compete with larger variants of Boeing’s new B787 and its existing B777 long-range widebody twin. All A350s will have a range in excess of 8,000 nautical miles. The variants will share a largely common wing design and wing span though the -1000 model will have a 4% larger wing area, achieved by extending the trailing section aft.

Intensive development

An intensive development effort has achieved significant milestones. One, reached in December 2008, was Maturity Gate 5 (MG 5), the point at which the aircraft configuration is considered fully defined. MG5 cleared the way for detailed design of components and enabled production of jigs and tooling to commence for long-lead items. This is crucial in the case of composites, for which production requires early commitments to tool manufacturers. Airbus regularly updates its data to these suppliers and many of the required tools are now available. The Maturity A milestone, which encompasses MG5 and earlier gates, was followed last year by Maturity B, by which point all design teams had finalised their designs.

Today the A350 XWB is progressing steadily from the design and development phase towards production. Airbus has assembled a detailed digital model of the aircraft for use as a common reference for component manufacture by its own sites and its suppliers. Rather than rely too much on this, however, the airframer has also implemented a demonstrator programme under which a physical mock-ups of the fuselage, wing and other major structures are being produced. A350 programme head Didier Evrard describes this activity as an essential ‘bridge between the digital model and the real world,’ important for validating composite production processes as manufacture ramps up towards the 10 aircraft per month rate targeted.

A modified production strategy for the A350 sees Airbus relying on a select group of Tier 1 supplier/partners chosen for their ability to shoulder full responsibility for delivering large pre-assemblies that are complete and ready for assembly into the final aircraft. It has not gone quite as far down the dispersed outsourcing track as Boeing first aimed to do and, by maintaining closer supervision within its partnership arrangements, hopes to avoid the supply chain pitfalls that have afflicted the Dreamliner programme.

The biggest difference in approach between the airframers, however, is that related to fuselage manufacture. Whereas Boeing is producing the B787 fuselage in large monolithic tape-wound barrel sections that are subsequently joined, Airbus has opted to clothe a pre-fabricated fuselage skeleton with large carbon fibre composite panels. This less radical solution reduces risk, says Airbus, while also having the advantage that panel properties can be optimised to their locations in the fuselage (whether crown, belly or sides) with resultant weight saving. Other benefits include easier handling, less expensive autoclaves and the fact that having a panel fail at post-manufacture inspection for any reason is less of a setback than losing a complete barrel. Stringers and most frames are of carbon, though certain frames in high load areas are titanium so that crashworthiness criteria can be met. Airbus reversed an earlier decision to use metal stringers in favour of co-curing carbon stringers within the skin panels. This reduces the number of separately fabricated parts and fasteners. Crossbeams, however, are of aluminium-lithium.

The nose section is only partly composite, metal having been retained because the one-piece carbon fibre structure that had earlier been considered would have required titanium reinforcement to meet bird strike requirements, making it uncompetitive on cost.

Airbus Hamburg is responsible for fuselage development and final assembly, with an associate plant at nearby Stade producing some carbon fibre panels. Centre fuselage build-up takes place at the Aerolia (formerly Airbus) site in Saint-Nazaire, France, using upper and lower shells provided by Spirit AeroSystems Inc in North Carolina, USA.

Wings are produced mainly in the UK (Filton and Broughton), while the centre wing box is manufactured at Nantes in France. However, Spirit AeroSystems is responsible for the wing fixed leading edge including the front wing spar, a 105 ft long composite structure weighing some 2000 lb. Tailplane (empennage) components are being produced by Airbus Spain and Germany, and in China. Final assembly of the aircraft will take place in Toulouse, France.

Many of the production facilities, including those for composites, are new. A €150 million fuselage assembly hangar at Hamburg, with a production area of some 15 000 m2, was completed this summer. At a ceremony in July a topping out wreath decorated with carbon fibre was a symbolically appropriate part of the occasion. A new composite production facility at Stade currently has a workforce of about 100, but this is expected to grow to nearer 500 as production builds up to full rate. In July, Spirit AeroSystems formally opened a new 46 500 m2 composite manufacturing facility in Kinston, North Carolina, after a two-year construction phase. By now, some 200 people there are engaged on Airbus work, a tally that is expected to rise to about 700 over the next few years.

The A350 has a wing and centre wing box that are more extensively composite (about 80%) than on previous Airbus aircraft and the production arrangements reflect this. With majority production of the wings taking place in the UK, Airbus has expanded its capability at Broughton, North Wales, with a new 46 000 m2 factory dedicated to A350 XWB wing production. Wing design and engineering take place at the Airbus UK site at Filton, Bristol.

Broughton is due to commence assembly of the first wing about now. According to Brian Fleet, head of the wing programme, the British operations had to fight hard to keep wing production in the UK and have committed to efficiency improvements aimed at cutting cost by around 30%.

Parts of the wing are manufactured elsewhere. The role of Spirit AeroSystems in producing the fixed portion of the forward part of the wing, including the forward spar, has already been mentioned. GKN Aerospace has invested substantially in the site at Filton that it acquired from Airbus in 2008. Here, co-located with the Airbus wing design activity, it is setting up to produce the entire portion of the wing aft of and including the rear spar, except the wing skins which are being manufactured in mainland Europe and certain trailing edge components being made by GE Aviation at Hamble near Southampton in the UK.

Dozens of organisations around the world are involved in the supply chain. Aerolia, the French aerostructures specialist that emerged out of Airbus in 2009, is responsible for A350 nose and fuselage structures in both metal and composite, and has invested €160 million in a new composites facility. Its own supply chain tail includes Corse Composites (landing gear doors), Latecoere (nose fairing), plus a number of design associates. In Germany, Premium Aerotec, a similarly semi-autonomous EADS subsidiary, is producing much of the forward fuselage plus parts of the aft fuselage including the side shells, floor grid and aft pressure bulkhead. Its investment of some €360 million in the programme has included €6.5 million on a new 25 m long by 8 m high South Korea-built autoclave weighing 260 tonnes. This is installed at a new production hall at Augsberg.

Figeac Aero, also in France, is to manufacture floor sections under sub-contract to Aerolia while FACC AG, the Austrian company now majority owned by the Xian Aircraft Industry Group, has a contract to produce blended winglets along with a number of other A350 components. The Duqueine Group, France, is to fabricate fuselage frames for Premium Aerotec and Aerolia, plus window frames for Spirit AeroSystems. Frame production work has also gone to Alliant Techsystems (ATK) in the United States, along with manufacture of fuselage stringers. ATK recently spent €175 million on expanding its composite production facilities.

China’s Avicopter, one of the country’s composite leaders, has a joint venture (JV) with Airbus parent EADS to produce A350 rudders in a new factory at the Harbin Hafei Airbus Composite Manufacturing Centre. This JV is also to produce A350 elevators, under contract to Aernnova Aerospace in Spain. Airbus and China have an understanding that 5% of the A350’s airframe should be built in China, a commitment that was fully fulfilled with the recent allocation of wing spoiler and droop panel manufacture to Chinese companies. Another EADS joint venture is that with German company SGL to produce fuselage frames. Goodrich Corporation is to supply composite engine nacelles and thrust reversers. Korean Air Aerospace Division is to fabricate three of the aircraft’s safety-critical composite doors.

Automating composite production has engaged a number of suppliers including:

MAG Industrial Automation Systems, provider of Viper automated fibre placement machines used at several production sites;

M Torres, supplier of gantry-style automated tape laying, fibre placement and inspection machines;

Flow International, manufacturer of machine tools for composites, including abrasive waterjet units; plus

Aim Engineering and several other jig and tool specialists.

Hexcel Composites expects to make billions of dollars over the life of the programme by providing composite materials, principally its HexPly toughened epoxy product incorporating intermediate modulus carbon fibre. Two years ago Hexcel opened a carbon fibre production plant at Illescas near Toledo, Spain, fibre from which goes to a partner plant in nearby Paria for conversion into prepreg.

Final aircraft assembly will take place in Toulouse where a new A350 XWB assembly unit is being built close to an existing A330/340 production line at a cost of €140 million. The 7.4 hectare assembly area, nearing completion after almost two years of construction, has impressive ‘green’ credentials. There is a high proportion of natural lighting, and with 27 000 m2 of photovoltaic roofing and an advanced energy management system, the site is expected to generate over half of its energy. Use of parallel workflow lines is expected to enable up to ten A350s to be produced per month eventually.

Logistics

As with the Dreamliner, A350 production involves considerable movement of large aerostructures. Fuselage items manufactured in North Carolina will be shipped across the Atlantic to be received at a new Spirit facility in Saint-Nazaire and assembled there into the full 65 ft by 20 ft centre fuselage frame section, which next goes to Hamburg for full fuselage integration. These and other fuselage sections completed at Saint-Nazaire are transported by Beluga – an Airbus A300 modified to carry outsized cargoes in its large whale-like cargo belly - to either Hamburg or Toulouse. Since Saint-Nazaire, Hamburg and Toulouse all have waterside access, items may optionally be shipped by sea.

Spirit AeroSystems will despatch its wing contribution to its operation in Prestwick, Scotland, for integration into the wing leading section before the latter is transported to the final assembly site. The main body of the wing, complete with the trailing edge portion, is flown from the wing assembly site at Broughton, UK, to Toulouse as a final assembly item.

Centre wing boxes are transferred from Nantes to Saint-Nazaire for integration. Other items are transported to European plants from as far afield as the United States, Korea, Malaysia and China.

‘Becoming real’

A key production milestone achieved at Nantes in December 2009 prompted Didier Evrard to declare, “the A350XWB is becoming real!” This happened when work on the centre wing box (CWB) began with the fabrication of a large carbon composite panel. The panel, with its 36 m2 surface area, was formed using a new state-of-the-art tape laying machine and is the largest ‘monobloc’ composite panel ever manufactured at Nantes. Subsequently, tooling for the keel beam was commissioned in Nantes in June. This is a large item that enables the lower shell of the keel beam and the lower panel of the centre fuselage to be laid up in one go. Assembly of the first keep beam is due to start about now.

. In August, work began on one of the largest carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) items on the aircraft – a 31.6 m by 5.6 m upper wing shell.

At Stade, in August, work began on one of the largest carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) items on the aircraft – a 31.6 m by 5.6 m upper wing shell. A massive autoclave facility installed at the plant can accommodate and cure two of these shells simultaneously. Airbus’ use for the first time of automated tape laying to produce this shell is aimed at ensuring speedy production, and consistent high product quality. In September, Airbus in Spain unveiled an even larger piece of wing skin at its Advanced Composites Centre in Illescas. The 32 m by 7 m lower wing cover, a double-curvature item fabricated to precise tolerances, is one of the biggest CFRP components ever built by the aeronautical industry.

Meanwhile in the UK, GKN Aerospace engineers early this year fabricated and evaluated their first composite wing spar, intended for the A350 wing box demonstrator. Preparations are now being finalised at Filton for series production of spars using automated fibre placement and other automated techniques.

At the same time, 11 Airbus and associated sites in Germany, France and Spain have been working together to produce a demonstrator fuselage. Recently the programme completed a second large test fuselage section (the parallel part of the fuselage is produced in three sections). The 18 m long section, with a diameter of more than 6 m, served to develop and validate the compete process chain, from the manufacture of individual panels, frames and clips to shell assembly, section assembly and production of long circumferential joints. Airbus has also had to develop and refine methods for producing fuselage frames, window frames, fasteners and doors, including a hybrid CFRP/titanium door structure being used for the first time.

As well as establishing production processes, demonstrators are used to validate the Electrical Structure Network (ESN), a critical matter with composites since electrical paths for lightning strikes have to be engineered into the structure rather than being freely available as in metals. This is achieved on A350 fuselages by connecting metal frames, aluminium strips attached to composite frames, the metal floor grid etc together in a conductive network. (Boeing is incorporating an electrically conducting metal mesh within its B787 fuselage lay-up.)

Another vital aspect of fuselage evolution is panel development. In September/October, Airbus flight tested an A350 CFRP fuselage panel on an A340 test aircraft, where it was installed in place of a standard metal panel. The 14 m2 panel, produced at Nantes, incorporates microphones so that technicians can assess the panel’s acoustic behaviour when combined with various insulation materials. This is to determine to what extent acoustic energy will be transmitted into the aircraft through a stiff carbon structure, a matter that is still in question. Fuselage sections equipped with fully furnished cabins will be used for assessing the acoustic characteristics of a full composite fuselage. Production of panels is commencing at Premium Aerotec, Aerolia and other aerostructure partners.

Frames, too, are a particular composites focus. Duqueine produced its first frame for Airbus’ demonstrator fuselage in January, using a multiaxial prepreg bending process that it developed in partnership with Airbus over the previous two years. ATK Aerospace Structures recently delivered its first composite stringers, produced using its proprietary automated stiffener forming system, and frames will follow.

Longer wait

Given what is, even for Airbus, a quantum leap further into composites, it is perhaps not surprising that the development programme is slipping behind schedule. So far the airframer has admitted to a delay of about three months, forcing it to compress the originally intended 15-month flight test programme into 12 months in order to meet early delivery commitments. Industry analysts and sources within Airbus suggest that the final delay will be greater than this.

Although manufacture of initial parts is now under way, these are for the demonstrator mock-up and parts for the first production aircraft, MSN001, come next. Start of final assembly of MSN001, the first A350-900, has been pushed back from the second quarter of 2011 to the third quarter, with first flight projected for mid 2012. The ensuing compressed flight test programme will require five aircraft to amass 2600 flight hours before certification can be achieved. The sixth aircraft manufactured will be the first for customer delivery.

Airbus cites four main issues stretching the development timescale: airframe sizing, the electrical structure network, the wing root join, and fuselage damage tolerance. Of these, the first two are considered resolved and progress on the other two is said to be good. Didier Evrard admits that the decision to push back fabrication is due to working in so many areas with carbon fibre. He says that, unlike with metal, it is not possible to commit from a global finite element model and that with composites ‘you only get one chance.‘ He adds that the delays should affect only the -900 variant. The smaller -800 should follow a year after the baseline -900, and the largest -1000 a year after that.

In addition to evidence of slippage in detailed engineering, sources within the supply chain say that shipments of some parts are up to six months late. Analysts may well be justified in suggesting that the first -900 delivery will not take place before 2014. Moreover, early aircraft are likely to be overweight.

Even so, customers do not seem unduly perturbed at present. Given the prospect of an exceptionally light, largely plastic low-maintenance long-range widebody aircraft offering operating costs some 20% lower than current-generation jets, they are prepared to wait a little longer.

Airbus: Bearing Box Failed in Rolls-Royce Engine - CBS News,"Fri, 12 Nov 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWJlYXJpbmctYm94LWZhaWxlZC1pbi1yb2xscy1yb3ljZS1lbmdpbmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An Airbus executive said Friday that Rolls-Royce has identified a faulty bearing box as the cause of the oil leak problem implicated in the midair disintegration of an engine on one of the world's largest airliners, an Australian newspaper reported.

Airbus Chief Operating Officer John Leahy told reporters in Sydney that Rolls-Royce had at some point fixed the bearing box on newer versions of the massive Trent 900 engine, a model designed for the massive A380 superjumbo. He said Rolls was now fixing it on older versions. The Herald Sun reported his comments on its website.

His comments did not address why Rolls-Royce had not fixed the bearing box in older versions of the engine.

Airbus did not elaborate and Rolls-Royce declined to comment on his remarks.

The box in question contains the metal ball bearings that allow movement of the drive shaft that spins the turbines inside jet engines. Investigators have said that leaking oil caused a fire in the engine of a Qantas A380 that heated metal parts and made the motor disintegrate over Indonesia last week, sending shrapnel into the wing and cutting vital safety systems before the jetliner landed safely in Singapore.

They have focused on broken pieces of the engine's heavy turbine disc, a plate that holds the turbine blades that move air through the motor.

EU Air Regulator Eyes Oil Fire in A380 Engines

A380 Engine Tests Ordered by Euro Regulator

Engines on the A380 malfunctioned four times before the disintegration on the flight from Singapore to Sydney. All of the planes landed safely.

The problems dating to 2008 led to two warnings for airlines to check parts of the Trent 900.

Three of the four problems centered on the turbines or oil system.

Rolls-Royce Group PLC said in an update to investors Friday that the disintegration of the Qantas engine resulted from a problem in a specific component in the Trent 900, but it did not provide details.

""The failure was confined to a specific component in the turbine area of the engine. This caused an oil fire, which led to the release of the intermediate pressure turbine disc,"" Rolls-Royce said.

The statement supports a report from the European Aviation Safety Agency, which issued an emergency order Thursday requiring airlines to re-examine their Trent 900s and ground any planes with suspicious leaks.

Leahy said the new models of the Trent 900 had been redesigned to eliminate the problem of excess oil causing turbine fires. He said that Rolls-Royce was retrofitting the older versions with new parts to stop the oil leaks and computer software that would shut down an engine with leaking oil before it was put at risk of disintegration.

""In the future the computer will have software that can identify a problem at the outset and it will shut down an engine before a turbine disc can go out of control and come apart,"" Leahy told the Herald Sun.

Leaks or oil stains have been discovered on six of the total of twenty A380s operated by Qantas, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines that use the Trent 900, a technologically advanced model designed to be lighter, quieter and more efficient than older engines. Qantas and Singapore Airlines have grounded nine of the world's largest airliner between them while Germany's Lufthansa has already replaced an engine on one of its A380s.

Rolls-Royce's chief executive said the company will be replacing the relevant part to enable its customers to bring the whole fleet back into service.

Airbus will take Rolls-Royce engines off the final assembly line in Toulouse, France, and send them to Qantas ""so we can get Qantas back up and flying,"" the Airbus press office said.

The disintegration on the Qantas A380 was far more serious than the airline has implied in its public statements, however, experts said.

Damage from engine shrapnel to the wing over the engine occurred very close to the wing's front spar, one of two support beams in the wing that attach the wing to the plane, said John Goglia, a former member of the National Transportation Safety Board and an expert on airline maintenance. If the shrapnel had hit the spar it could possibly have weakened the spar and even have caused the wing to fall off, he said.

As it was, the shrapnel appears to have damaged electrical cables and hydraulic lines inside the wing, Goglia said. Pilots were unable to close the landing gear doors, an indication of hydraulic damage, and had difficulty shutting down the engine next to the engine that disintegrated, an indication of an electrical problem, he said. The A380 has four engines.

Photos and video of the incident and its aftermath show the shrapnel clearly ruptured a hydraulic line and an electric line in the wing, cutting off the pilots' control of half the brake flaps and the remaining engine on the affected wing, along with the door of the landing-gear compartment, said Joerg Handwerg, a spokesman for the pilots' union for Lufthansa.

In its trading update Friday, London-based Rolls-Royce said the incident will cause full year profit growth ""to be slightly lower than previously guided,"" but it also said that the company's other operations will help to offset any losses. Back in July, the company said that its underlying profits would grow by 4-5 percent compared to 2009.

Shares in the company rose after the update - a signal that investors are happy to see a definitive statement after days of silence from the world's second-biggest engine maker behind General Electric and one of the last globally important industrial manufacturing companies in Britain.

Rolls-Royce shares were up 4 percent at 607.5 pence ($9.74) in midmorning trade on the London Stock Exchange.

Handwerg said that minor problems are routine for any jet engine, but it is possible that the issues were an indication that regulators did not adequately check the engine before approving it for commercial use.

""When you see we have a problem with not just one of these engines but several then it points towards that we have a problem in the certification process,"" Handwerg said."
CEO: Design fault may have caused A380 engine failure - CNN,"Fri, 05 Nov 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHA6Ly93d3cuY25uLmNvbS8yMDEwL1dPUkxEL2FzaWFwY2YvMTEvMDUvYXVzdHJhbGlhLnFhbnRhcy5pbmNpZGVudC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sydney, Australia (CNN) -- A design issue rather than poor maintenance is likely to blame for the mid-flight failure of a Qantas airliner's engine, the CEO of the Australian carrier said Friday.

One of the four engines on the Qantas Airbus A380 shut down six minutes after takeoff Thursday from Singapore's Changi Airport, forcing it to return and make an emergency landing.

The plane -- with 440 passengers and 26 crew members -- was headed to Sydney, Australia. But while above the western Indonesian island of Batam, part of the engine's covering, or cowling, tore off.

""This issue does not relate to maintenance; this is an engine issue,"" CEO Alan Joyce told reporters Friday. ""And the engines have been maintained by Rolls-Royce since they've been installed on the aircraft.""

""So we believe that this is probably most likely a material failure or some sort of design issue that we're tracking and trying to understand,"" he added. ""We don't believe this is related to maintenance in any way.""

On Friday, Airbus announced that it had asked all operators of A380s with Rolls-Royce engines to inspect them as a precaution.

Following the Qantas CEO's comments, a Rolls-Royce spokesman referred back to his company's earlier news statement, which said:

""Since Qantas QF32 suffered an engine failure and returned safely to Singapore Changi Airport, we have been working closely with our customer and the authorities. In situations like these, Rolls-Royce has well established processes to collect and understand information relating to the event and to determine suitable actions.""

After the incident, Qantas -- Australia's national airline -- grounded its Airbus A380 fleet.

The airline said flights of the twin-deck planes -- the world's largest airliners -- will remain suspended until an investigation is complete.

On Friday, Joyce said Qantas hopes to resume A380 flights within 48 hours, after completing engine safety checks.

""We believe over the next 24 to 48 hours, those checks will be complete on all of the A380s, and if we don't find any adverse findings out of the checks, the aircraft will resume operations,"" he said.

Qantas has six A380s in its fleet of 191 planes. Airbus will at some point deliver 14 more, the airline said.

Passengers on the detoured Qantas flight spent the night in Singapore, then flew to Australia on Friday.

""Passengers left on a special Qantas flight at 10:30 a.m. local back to Sydney,"" said airline representative Ashley Edwards Knapp.

First major drama involving plane which came into service in 2007



Pierced by a foot-long hole and with debris lying along its wing, this is the Qantas superjumbo moments after making an emergency landing after one of its engines went up in flames.

Passengers on the Qantas Airbus A380 flight from London to Sydney via Singapore described 'a blast' before seeing smoke and door-size debris shooting past the windows 15 minutes after takeoff.

One traveller filmed the emergency from the window, also capturing the pilot's announcement on his phone as the craft turned round to make an emergency landing at Changi Airport, in Singapore.

Torn: A passenger captured the damage on the left wing of the Airbus A380 after it landed at Singapore's Changi Airport

The superjumbo was carrying 459 passengers and crew. Quantas has now grounded all six of its A380 airliners while safety checks are carried out

'I do apologise. We're having a technical issue with our number two engine,' he said.

'We have dealt with the situation at the moment. The aircraft is secure at this stage. We have to hold for some time as we lighten our load by dumping some fuel and (there's) a number of checks we have to perform.

'And as I'm sure you're aware we're not proceeding to Sydney at this stage. We're making a left turn back to Singapore.



'As we progress with this we'll keep you updated. At this stage everything is secure. The aircraft is flying safely and we'll get back to you with more information. Thank you for your patience.'

All 459 people on the flight, many of whom were British, were unhurt after the incident over western Indonesia.

Descent: A trail of fuel can be seen behind the plane as it comes into land at Singapore's Changi Airport

But Qantas has now grounded its six-strong superjumbo fleet while an investigation is carried out.

Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines powered the Qantas plane and a company spokesman said tonight that a 'number of basic precautionary engine checks' were being made.

He added: 'We will continue to work closely with our customers as the investigation moves forward. This is at a very early stage and it would be inappropriate to draw any conclusions at this time.'



The midair drama unfolded shortly after Flight QF432 had taken off from Singapore on its way to Sydney.

Passenger Lars Sandberg, a DJ from Glasgow, said he was 'just happy to be alive' after the plane landed safely back at Singapore airport.



Destroyed: One of the enginea of the Qantas airline appeared to have exploded. The pilot, who was flying the plane to Sydney, was forced to make an emergency landing in Singapore

Hose it down: Fire engines spray gallons of water over the plane's engines. A second engine failed to switch off, in addition to the one that blew-up mid-air

'When we got off and saw the engine itself and the back casing burnt off, that was pretty scary.



'It was a nerve-wracking experience and I feel a little bit shaken up. I'm just happy to be alive and safe in the terminal building,' he said.

Matt Hewitt from Cheshire, said some people on board had seen bits of a wing 'breaking up' with 'parts sticking up and wires hanging out'.



Six fire engines swarmed around the double-decker aircraft when it landed as a local reporter said he could see smoke still coming from the engine.

The engine closest to the fuselage on the left wing had visible burn marks and was missing a section of plate that would have been painted with the red kangaroo logo of the airline. The upper part of the left wing also appeared to have suffered some damage.

Glad to be back on the ground: Passengers from the superjumbo are shown through Changi Aiport, in Singapore, after their plane was forced to make an emergency landing

Relief:A large number of families - as well as more elderly passengers - were on the flight



Passenger Rosemary Hegardy, 60, from Sydney, said she heard two bangs and saw flames from her window.

'There were flames - yellow flames came out, and debris came off ... You could see black things shooting through the smoke, like bits of debris,' she said.

German passenger Ulf Waschbusch posted a message on Twitter shortly after landing which read: 'Just emergency landed back in Singapore after engine blew up at take-off and parts ripped through wings. Damn.'

Later, he told Daybreak how he had heard a loud boom noise shortly after take-off and looked out of the window to see what had happened.



'I saw pieces of the engine, number 3 engine, fly off the wing through the wings itself and short bursts of flames for about a second or two at that time,' he said.



'It was one of the scariest things I have ever seen on an aircraft.'

Near-miss: Damage to the wing of the plane, left, was photographed by passenger Christopher Lee and, right, another part of the plane that was found in western Indonesia

Blast: Indonesian officials hold a large section of the plane's debris bearing the iconic kangaroo logo

Witnesses on the ground on Batam Island in Indonesia told of hearing a 'very loud explosion'.

People were photographed holding pieces of the engine cover they had found on the ground.



'It sounded like a bomb,' said one witness.

Another witness spoke of hearing a screeching sound before the explosion. 'I thought I heard an explosion and when I looked up I saw a plane going round and round and there was smoke coming out of its tail,' he said.

Qantas CEO Alan Joyce denied there had been an explosion but said he was grounding his entire fleet of A380s

'Then three or four pieces of metal fell from the sky.'



A schoolteacher said some of the small pieces of debris crashed through the roof of a classroom, but no children were hurt.



Police officer Bobby Baharudin said debris was 'scattered over Batam'.



It was not immediately known if ash from the erupting Mount Merapi volcano had caused the engine problem - the volcano, which is spewing thick clouds, lies to the south of the route the jet was taking.



Geoff Reay, an Australian who lives on Batam Island, said his neighbours heard an explosion and ran out into the street.

'There are bits of aircraft lying on the ground and it landed about 200 yards from where our little boy goes to school. Other bits have fallen down in the suburb of Dutamas,' he said.

Indonesian officials are in the process of finding out if anyone has been killed or injured by the falling debris.

At first it was feared the jet had crashed - widespread rumours through Twitter reported that the plane had come down, resulting in Qantas officials issuing immediate denials.

Kompas, a leading Indonesian newspaper, had reported on its website that it was 'suspected that a Qantas plane exploded in the air near Batam.'

Mr Tatang Kurnia, head of Indonesia's Transport Safety Board, said the plane emptied fuel and returned to Singapore to make an emergency landing shortly after it had taken off from the island republic.

Emergency: Passengers emerge from the superjumbo in Singapore. They are now being offered counselling The plane was flying from London to Sydney via Singapore. Debris rained down on the Indonesian island of Batam

Fairfax Media in Australia quoted an anonymous Qantas pilot as saying that engines were routinely shut down on aircraft which fly around the world but 'it must have been quite a catastrophic failure if it blew parts off an engine.'

A Qantas jet suffered a similar incident in August when an engine on a flight to San Francisco exploded, causing debris to tear holes in the engine cover.

Investigators with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau found the engine's turbine blades had either fractured or broken away. The cause of that explosion in the Boeing 747's Rolls Royce RB211 engine is still under investigation.



Qantas denied there had been an explosion today and said the plane landed safely with no injuries.

The distinctive double-decker Airbus costs £156m and came into service in September 2007.Qantas have been using them since 2008.



The flight is a regular service that flies between Sydney, Singapore and London and is usually flown by a superjumbo. Qantas' A380s can carry up to 525 people.

A Qantas statement said the Airbus 380 plane experienced an 'engine issue' soon after taking off from Singapore for Sydney. It made a safe emergency landing in Singapore at 11:45am local time with 433 passengers and 26 crew on board, the statement said.

'Some media reports suggested the aircraft had crashed. These reports are incorrect. No Qantas aircraft has crashed,' it said.

Qantas chief executive officer Alan Joyce said the airline is now suspending all flights of its six Airbus A380 jetliners.

Qantas crew members leave the Changi air terminal in Singapore after making the emergency landing

Mr Joyce told a news conference in Sydney: 'We will suspend those A380 services until we are completely confident that Qantas safety requirements have been met.'

There are currently 37 of the A380 aircraft in operation around the world.

Singapore Airlines has 11 of the superjumbos, Emirates 13, Qantas six, Air France four and German carrier Lufthansa three.

British Airways and Virgin Atlantic are among a number of carriers who have placed orders for A380s. In all, Toulouse-based Airbus has 234 orders from 17 countries for the superjumbo.

Qantas said it was arranging hotel rooms in Singapore for passengers and crew of the affected flight today.

'We are currently planning for an aircraft to depart for Singapore to bring passengers back to Sydney tomorrow morning,' a spokesman added.

Qantas A380s use Rolls-Royce RR.L Trent 900 engines. Shares in Rolls-Royce slumped 1.2 per cent in early-morning trading following the incident.

Emirates and Singapore Airlines said all its A380s would be operating as scheduled.

The Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association said safety was a growing concern for engineers at Qantas as outsourcing of work continued.

'It's about time Qantas listened to the warning signs,' spokesman Steve Purvinas said.

'We know that the dramatic increase in the number of safety incidents involving Qantas jets coincides with an increase in the amount of work that is no longer carried out in-house.'

Mr Purvinas said Qantas had shut down every in-house engine workshop in Australia in the past 10 years, and was naive for believing the current number of maintenance engineers could maintain its growing fleet of A380s.

Airbus A320neo to enter service in 2016 | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Tue, 30 Nov 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWEzMjBuZW8tdG8tZW50ZXItc2VydmljZS1pbi0yMDE2Lzk3MTcxLmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has confirmed the launch of its A320neo, or new engine option, for entry into service in 2016.

Airlines will have a choice between the CFM International LEAP-X and Pratt & Whitney's PurePower PW1100G powerplants. The A320neo will also incorporate ""sharklet"" wing-tips that help to save fuel, says the airframer.

""The A320neo will not only deliver significant fuel savings of up to 15%, which represents up to 3,600t of CO2 savings annually per A320neo. In addition, A320neo customers will benefit from a double-digit reduction in NOx emissions, reduced engine noise, lower operating costs and up to 500nm (950 km) more range or two tonnes more payload,"" adds the EADS subsidiary.

The new engine option is offered on the A321, A320 and A319 models, and will require limited modifications primarily to the wing and pylon areas, says Airbus. The A320neo will have over 95% airframe commonality with the standard A320 family, it adds.

The company sees a market potential of 4,000 A320neo family aircraft over the next 15 years. It has, however, not named any launch customers yet.

""We are confident that the A320neo will be a great success across all markets and with all types of operators, offering them maximum benefit with minimum change. We are leveraging a reliable, mature aircraft and are making it even more efficient and environmentally friendly,"" said Tom Enders, Airbus president and CEO.

Airbus says that it seeks to provide customers with the latest and most eco-efficient technologies to improve aircraft performance and airline operations, while reducing the environmental impact.

""Over the past months, Airbus has taken the time to carefully assess and weigh up the benefits of the A320neo business case with the allocation of the highly skilled engineering resources needed, while at the same time securing the engineering skills required on other Airbus aircraft programmes,"" says the company.

The company is working to ramp up the production rates on its A380 aircraft programme, and is developing the A350 medium-range widebody that is due to enter into service in 2013.

The Pratt & Whitney PW1524G engine is scheduled for an entry into service in 2013 on the Bombardier CSeries CS100, the first of two 110 to 149-seat models offered by the Canadian aircraft maker. These will compete with the A318, A319, Boeing 737--600 and -700.

CFM is set to introduce its Leap-X1C on the 160-seat Commercial Aircraft Corp of China C919, which will see its first revenue service in 2016 as well.

""We are obviously honored to be part of this exciting (A320neo) programme,"" says Eric Bachelet, president and CEO of CFM International. ""This is a natural extension of the long and very successful relationship we have enjoyed with Airbus since the inception of the A320 family program in the early 1980s. CFM pledges its full support to the A320neo's development and certification and to its successful entry into commercial service.""

The Airbus decision comes after a protracted internal debate over the viability of re-engining the company's best selling models. Boeing still has yet to announce its future plans for the 737. Both companies, however, have been boosting production to record levels to satisfy global demand for their short-haul aircraft.

Qantas grounds all of its Airbus A380 superjumbos - cleveland.com,"Thu, 04 Nov 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAxMC8xMS9xYW50YXNfZ3JvdW5kc19hbGxfb2ZfaXRzX2FpcmIuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SINGAPORE -- Qantas grounded its Airbus A380 fleet after one of the superjumbo jets blew out an engine Thursday, shooting flames and raining large metal chunks before making a safe emergency landing in Singapore with 459 people aboard.

It was most serious midair incident involving the double-decker A380, the world's largest and latest airliner, since it debuted in October 2007 with Singapore Airlines flying it to Sydney -- the same route that Qantas flight QF34 was flying when it was stricken.

Qantas said there had been no explosion, but witnesses aboard the plane and on the ground reported blasts. Officials in Indonesia said the engine trouble could not have been related to recent volcanic eruptions of Mount Merapi, some 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) to the east.

After the plane touched down in Singapore, the engine closest to the fuselage on the left wing had visible burn marks and was missing a plate section that would have been painted with the red kangaroo logo of the airline. The upper part of the left wing also appeared damaged, indicating that one or more pieces from the engine gouged a hole in the wing.

One passenger, Rosemary Hegardy, 60, of Sydney, told The Associated Press that she heard two bangs and saw yellow flames from her window.

""There was flames -- yellow flames came out, and debris came off. ... You could see black things shooting through the smoke, like bits of debris,"" she said.

Although it was nearly 90 minutes from the time of the explosion to the plane landing, there was no panic inside the aircraft, she said.

The captain addressed the passengers immediately by saying ""'I'm sure you realize there's a problem. We have to find out what the problem is,'"" she said. Shortly after that, the captain explained that an engine had failed and needed to dump fuel before landing.

""The crew were fantastic, really -- I am so amazed that everyone stayed calm,"" she said. ""We were all sort of really shaken up, but what could you do?""

In another seat, Tyler Wooster watched as part of the skin of the wing peeled off, exposing foam and broken wires.

""My whole body just went to jelly and I didn't know what was going to happen as we were going down, if we were going to be OK,"" Wooster told Australia's Nine Network news.

Residents on the western Indonesian island of Batam, near Singapore, helped authorities pick up more than 100 pieces of debris scattered in 15 locations in Batam. The pieces, mostly small, torn metal but some the size of doors, were brought to police headquarters for the investigation.

The trouble with one of the plane's four engines happened 15 minutes after takeoff from Singapore at 9:56 a.m. The plane landed after one hour and 50 minutes.

""The shutdown of the Qantas engine had no connection with Mount Merapi,"" said Bambang Ervan, a spokesman for Indonesia's Transportation Ministry. ""It was too far from the volcano -- the sky over Singapore and Sumatra island is free of dust.""

The flight is a regular service that flies between Sydney, Singapore and London. Qantas' A380s can carry up to 525 people, but flight QF34 was carrying 433 passengers and 26 crew, all of whom were evacuated by a stepladder in an operation that lasted two hours.

Qantas spokeswoman Emma Kearns in Sydney said there were no injuries or an explosion on board. The airline described the problem as an ""engine issue"" without elaborating.

""We will suspend those A380 services until we are completely confident that Qantas safety requirements have been met,"" Qantas CEO Alan Joyce told a news conference.

Joyce appeared to blame the engine, made by Rolls-Royce.

""This issue, an engine failure, has been one that we haven't seen before. So we are obviously taking it very seriously, because it is a significant engine failure,"" he said.

Singapore Airlines later said in a statement it would be ""delaying all flights operating our A380 aircraft"" after Rolls-Royce and Airbus advised it to conduct precautionary technical checks. Germany's Lufthansa, which operates three A380s, said it was continuing with service as normal.

Experts said the problem appeared to be an ""uncontained engine failure,"" which occurs when turbine debris punctures the engine casing and the light cowling that covers the unit.

Aviation expert Tom Ballantyne told the AP that Thursday's troubles were ""certainly the most serious incident that the A380 has experienced since it entered operations.""

But ""it's not like the aircraft is going to drop out of the sky,"" Ballantyne, Sydney-based chief correspondent at Orient Aviation Magazine, said by telephone from Brunei.

He said the engine shutdown couldn't have caused a crash. The planes are designed to fly on just two engines, and the pilots are trained to handle engine failures, he said.

Rolls-Royce said it was aware of the situation, noting that the investigation was still at an early stage. Its shares fell more than 5 percent on the London Stock Exchange.

Airbus said in a statement that it was providing all necessary technical assistance to the investigation and a team of specialists from Airbus was being dispatched to Singapore.

Martin Fendt, a spokesman for the consortium, declined to comment on Qantas' grounding of all its A380s, but he said no airworthiness directives have been issued mandating a halt to flights by the superjumbo.

Still, the incident is likely to raise safety questions about one of the most modern aircraft, which has suffered a series of minor incidents.

In September 2009, a Singapore Airlines A380 was forced to turn around in mid-flight and head back to Paris after an engine malfunction. On March 31, a Qantas A380 with 244 people on board burst two tires on landing in Sydney after a flight from Singapore.

Last August, a Lufthansa crew shut down one of the engines as a precaution before landing at Frankfurt on a flight from Japan, after receiving confusing information on a cockpit indicator.

The other issues with the A380s have all been relatively minor, such as electrical problems, Ballantyne said.

Qantas' safety record is enviable among major airlines, with no fatal crashes since it introduced jet-powered planes in the late 1950s.

But there have been a run of scares in recent years across a range of plane types. The most serious -- when a faulty oxygen tank caused an explosion that blew a 5-foot hole in the fuselage of a Boeing 747-400 over the Philippines -- prompted aviation officials to order Qantas to upgrade maintenance procedures.

Airbus has delivered a total of 37 A380s so far. Thirteen are in service with Emirates, 11 with Singapore Airlines, six with Qantas, four with Air France and three with Lufthansa.

Emirates airlines, which has 13 A380s in operation, said all of them are flying as scheduled. It noted that its planes are powered by Engine Alliance GP7200 engines.

Thursday's incident appeared unrelated to mail bombs sent recently on cargo planes, allegedly from Yemeni militants."
Qantas Grounds Airbus A380 Fleet After Engine Failure - Voice of America - VOA News,"Wed, 03 Nov 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvZW5naW5lLWZhaWx1cmUtZm9yY2VzLWFpcmxpbmVyLXRvLXJldHVybi10by1zaW5nYXBvcmUtMTA2Njc1NDI4LzEyOTc1Mi5odG1s0gFnaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm9hbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL2VuZ2luZS1mYWlsdXJlLWZvcmNlcy1haXJsaW5lci10by1yZXR1cm4tdG8tc2luZ2Fwb3JlLTEwNjY3NTQyOC8xMjk3NTIuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qantas Airways says it will suspend all Airbus A380 flights until they determine the cause of an engine failure that occurred earlier in the day.



A Qantas spokeswoman says Flight QF32 was en route from Singapore to Sydney when one of the A380 jet's four engines shut down.



Aviation industry consultant Gerry Soejatman says the airline industry term for what occurred is an uncontained engine failure.



""That means the engine failed in a manner in which it could not be contained in the engine itself. So there would be parts flying around,"" he said.



Witnesses on the Indonesian island of Batam near Singapore reported hearing an explosion as the plane passed over, and found debris that appeared to be from an aircraft.



Tatang Kurnia, head of Indonesia's Transportation Safety Board, says there are pieces of debris in Batam with red coloring on it and Singapore confirmed that an airplane in the area dumped fuel to make an emergency landing.



The plane returned to Singapore as a precaution. There were initial fears the Airbus 380 had crashed.



No injuries among 459 people on board have been reported, but in Batam two people were reportedly hit by falling debris.



The cause of the engine failure has not been reported. Australian aviation safety officials are on their way to Singapore to check the aircraft and the flight recorder. Soejatman says it is not surprising that the incident occurred during take-off.



""During the take-off phase of the flight, it is the time when the engines are put at most strain, after it shut down from the previous flight,"" he said. ""So that is mechanically the riskiest part of the flight.""



There are 37 Airbus A380 aircraft in use around the world. Qantas has six in operation and 20 more on order. The planes are the largest passenger aircraft and some can carry up to 800 people.



News of this incident comes at a time when airlines around the world are on high alert after discovery of bombs packed in air cargo in Europe."
Airbus: Superjumbo problem resolved - Al Jazeera English,"Thu, 04 Nov 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDEwLzExLzQvYWlyYnVzLXN1cGVyanVtYm8tcHJvYmxlbS1yZXNvbHZlZNIBT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvMjAxMC8xMS80L2FpcmJ1cy1zdXBlcmp1bWJvLXByb2JsZW0tcmVzb2x2ZWQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Louis Gallois, Airbus chief executive, had said on Wednesday that the wiring problems were close to being resolved, signaling good news for launch customer Singapore Airlines.

“The new electrical cabling for the first Airbus A380 intended for Singapore Airlines was installed last week,” Gallois had told journalists, saying that the cabin equipment for the plane, which is in the northern German city, would be installed next week.

“We are determined to complete this first delivery in October 2007, as we announced, and to prepare ourselves for the next deliveries in 2008,” he added.

Fabrice Bregier, Airbus managing director, said that the cabling for several aircraft would be completely re-installed and a temporary technical solution had been found to equip the first 25 aircraft.

From the beginning of 2008, the use of new wiring design software such as Catia V and Circe would help with the cabling of aircraft to be delivered from 2009.

Singapore Airlines has committed to buy 19 A380s with other customers including Thai Airways, China Southern Airlines, Australia’s Qantas, Malaysia Airlines, Korean Air and Virgin Atlantic.

Parcel problems

UPS, the Parcel delivery company, said on Friday that it had not decided whether to cancel its order for the superjumbos.

French business daily Les Echos, citing unidentified sources, reported on Friday that UPS would cancel its order for 10 A380s next week.

“We continue to talk to Airbus. We haven’t changed our order and we haven’t made a decision one way or the other, so the order still stands,” said Lynnette McIntire, a spokeswoman for UPS in Atlanta.

Airbus spokeswoman Barbara Kracht said on Friday that she had no information about a possible cancellation.

A cancellation would leave Airbus with no more customers for the cargo version of the A380, after FedEx and International Lease Finance canceled their orders last year."

The airline described the measure as precautionary. But it casts further doubt on the safety of the world's largest aircraft and their Rolls Royce engines. Both Airbus and Rolls Royce saw their share prices dip after an engine exploded during a Qantas Airlines flight from Singapore last week.



Qantas grounded its entire fleet of A380s after finding oil leaks in three of the engines. The Singapore Airline engines to be replaced also showed evidence of oil leaks, though the airline said they did not have the same problem as the Qantas engines.



Last week's Qantas flight returned safely to Singapore with 459 people on board after one of its four engines exploded, scattering debris on an island in Indonesia. Officials are still investigating the cause of the mishap.

Qantas Fears Engine Design Issue After Airbus Drama - Voice of America - VOA News,"Thu, 04 Nov 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvcWFudGFzLWZlYXJzLWVuZ2luZS1kZXNpZ24taXNzdWUtYWZ0ZXItYWlyYnVzLWRyYW1hLTEwNjc1NDcxMy8xMjk4NDUuaHRtbNIBZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9xYW50YXMtZmVhcnMtZW5naW5lLWRlc2lnbi1pc3N1ZS1hZnRlci1haXJidXMtZHJhbWEtMTA2NzU0NzEzLzEyOTg0NS5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Australia's Qantas Airlines said Friday that a faulty part or design issue may have been responsible for a midair engine failure on an Airbus passenger plane.



Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said it is too early to say exactly what caused the engine failure that prompted an emergency landing Thursday. However, he said it was most likely some kind of material failure or a design flaw in the Rolls-Royce engine.



Rolls-Royce has been maintaining the engines on the A380s, the world's largest passenger plane. But Joyce said he does not believe the problem was in any way related to maintenance.



The Australian airline grounded all six of its Airbus A380s after the engine, one of four on the plane, failed shortly after take-off from Singapore on a flight to Sydney.



The A380 returned to Singapore safely 90 minutes later after the pilot dumped fuel to reduce its weight. Qantas said no one was injured among the 459 passengers and crew on board.



Singapore Airlines also grounded all of its Airbus A380s, but later lifted the order saying it had checked and cleared the fleet of 11 planes.



Passengers on the Qantas flight said they heard an explosion, then saw flames shoot out of the damaged engine.



The plane's manufacturer, France-based Airbus, and Rolls-Royce said they would join air safety investigators from Singapore and elsewhere in determining the cause.



Witnesses in a nearby area of western Indonesia reported hearing a loud noise in the sky and seeing an airliner circling overhead. The head of Indonesia's Transportation Safety Board, Tantang Kurnia, said debris from the aircraft was found on the island of Batam. Some fell onto houses and a shopping mall.



There are about 25 jet engine failures each year, either in flight or on the ground. But the U.S. air safety investigative agency, the National Transportation Safety Board, said the failures rarely cause problems because multi-engine jets are designed to be flown with one inoperative engine. Pilots are trained to fly aircraft after an engine failure.



There are 37 Airbus A380s in operation around the world. The jets can carry up to 853 passengers, although most airlines configure the plane's seating to carry about 550. The jumbo jet is more than 24 meters high and 73 meters long. The plane costs $347 million.



Qantas has never had a fatal crash in its 90-year history.

Engineers find oil leaks in engines on three different Qantas Airbus A380s - New York Daily News,"Mon, 08 Nov 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55ZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDEwLzExLzA4L2VuZ2luZWVycy1maW5kLW9pbC1sZWFrcy1pbi1lbmdpbmVzLW9uLXRocmVlLWRpZmZlcmVudC1xYW50YXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzODBzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SYDNEY – Tests have uncovered oil leaks in three Rolls-Royce engines on Qantas‘ grounded Airbus A380s, the airline’s CEO said Monday, as engineers tried to zero in on the cause of an engine failure on board one of the carrier’s superjumbo jets last week.

Australia‘s national carrier grounded its six double-decker A380s, the world’s newest and largest airliner, after an engine burst minutes into a flight from Singapore to Sydney last week, scattering debris over Indonesia‘s Batam island. The plane made a safe emergency landing in Singapore.

Engineers conducted eight hours of extensive checks on each engine over the weekend.

On Monday, CEO Alan Joyce said engineers have discovered oil leaks in the turbine area of three engines on three different A380s.

“The oil leaks were beyond normal tolerances,” Joyce told reporters. “So Rolls-Royce and our engineers have looked at what we have gathered as an accepted level and they have passed that threshold.”

“All of these engines are new engines on a new aircraft type,” he added. “The engines are not performing to the parameters that you would expect with this.”

Because of that, he said, all of the airline’s A380s will be grounded for an additional 72 hours – at least.

All three affected engines have been removed from the planes for further testing, he said.

“As a consequence, it’s now narrowing our focus on that issue,” he said.

Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines, the other airlines that fly A380s fitted with Rolls-Royce’s Trent 900 engines, also briefly grounded their planes last week but resumed services after completing checks.

The Qantas engineers are working with Rolls-Royce, who manufactured and maintains the engines, as well as Airbus.

Investigators have focused their search on a missing piece of turbine from the Rolls-Royce engine.

The Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which is leading an international investigation into the blowout on the A380, appealed for help from residents of Indonesia’s Batam island to find the missing chunk of a turbine disc.

The island was scattered with debris last Thursday when one of the A380’s four Trent 900 engines failed minutes into a flight to Sydney, with 466 people aboard. The engine was quickly shut down and the plane returned to Singapore and safely made an emergency landing.

“The recovery of that disk could be crucial to a full understanding of the nature of the engine failure, and may have implications for the prevention of future similar occurrences,” the bureau said in a statement.

It released a photograph of a jagged and bent piece of turbine disc from the Trent 900 engine and asked that anyone who might have found a similar piece should hand it to police.

It said one piece of the shattered engine that had been found on Batam was being sent to Britain for examination by Rolls-Royce engineers, under the supervision of bureau investigators. Extra experts were being sent from Australia to Singapore to examine other debris.

Rolls-Royce Group PLC, a London-based aerospace, power systems and defense company separate from the car manufacturer, has said the investigation is in its early stages and that it is too early to draw any conclusions.

John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member and an expert on aircraft maintenance, said the photo showing the broken turbine disc indicates it was the disc that may have failed. The photo didn’t show any signs of discoloration on the disc that would indicate overheating.

There are several reasons why a disc might fail, but they usually involve the metal used to make the disc or the manufacturing method, Goglia said. He cautioned that he was looking at one photo, which was not enough information to make a definitive judgment."
Rolls-Royce shares recover after 'progress' on engine failure - CNN International,"Mon, 08 Nov 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHA6Ly9lZGl0aW9uLmNubi5jb20vMjAxMC9CVVNJTkVTUy8xMS8wOC9yb2xsc3JveWNlLmVuZ2luZXMvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"London, England (CNN) -- Shares in Rolls-Royce rose Monday after the company announced that it had made progress in understanding the cause of a Qantas mid-air engine blow-out.

The shares rose by 2.62 percent -- they had been 14 percent down from Thursday after the Australian carrier revealed early Monday that oil leaks had been discovered in the engines on three of its planes after being examined by Rolls-Royce engineers.

This follows last week's aborted flight by an A380, which was forced to make an emergency landing in Singapore shortly after take off when one of its engines failed.

Rolls-Royce on Monday issued a statement saying the Qantas problem was caused by an ""incident specific to the Trent 900 engine.""

""As a result, a series of checks and inspections has been agreed with Airbus, with operators of the Trent 900 powered A380 and with the airworthiness authorities,"" the Rolls-Royce statement continued.

Qantas CEO Alan Joyce told reporters the leaks were ""beyond normal tolerances"" and that the planes will not return to service until the airline is ""100 percent sure"" about their safety,

""It is disturbing that Qantas found three more engines that needed to be looked at. That's a total of four,"" aviation consultant Peter Goelz told CNN. ""This is a relatively... young aircraft. These engines have probably less than 200,000 total hours, so it is an issue that we need to be concerned about.""

New safety fears ground Qantas A380s

Singapore airlines and Lufthansa also operate the A380 equipped with Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines, but they reported no problems after carrying out their own extensive checks. Their fleets are now flying again.

Dubai-based Emirates also operate the double-decked Airbus A380 but with GP7000 engines, designed as part of a joint venture between U.S. manufacturers General Electric and Pratt and Whitney. These engines have not been part of the current safety scare.

Before the share price recovery, more than $1.6 billion had been wiped off the value of British-based Rolls-Royce, its share value dropping by 14 percent since Thursday. Shares in EADS, which owns Airbus, were down by half a percent for the same period.

""We're looking at a period of time when investors will be pretty jittery,"" said Dan Thisdell of Flightglobal.com.

""But they've got to grapple with this problem in a way that maintains confidence among their prospective customers as well as existing customers.

""If it is some kind of underlying design flaw, though this would seem unlikely given the enormous expertise and modern computer simulation technology available to Rolls-Royce, then there could be a problem given the level of investment involved.""

In August, another Rolls-Royce engine -- this time a Trent 1000 -- suffered an uncontained failure during testing in England. This particular model is designed to power Boeing's latest commercial aircraft, the 787 Dreamliner.

Rolls-Royce said on Tuesday that the Trent 1000 issue was not connected to the Qantas Trent 900 incident.

Rolls-Royce said in the statement: ""This incident happened during a development program with an engine operating outside normal parameters. We understand the cause and a solution has been implemented.""

With at least half of the 850 787s on order destined to be powered by Trent engines, Thisdell told CNN that this will be another profitable source of income for a very long time.

""Many airlines have placed orders for aircraft years down the line and have not yet selected their preferred engine,"" he said.

""But no-one has a better reputation than Rolls-Royce. Many airlines will order Rolls-Royce engines as a matter of course because they've had first rate service from them for years.

""Not every airline see it this way, but many -- particularly small and medium-sized airlines -- feel some comfort in having a single supplier of engines for all the aircraft they fly because it provides some commonality with maintenance, spares and training for mechanics.""

As if to reinforce this point, Rolls-Royce on Monday announced a new $350 million engine servicing contract with Egyptair, who operate a fleet of Airbus A330s fitted with Trent 700 engines."

The Airbus A380 superjumbo explosion on November 4 grounded the world’s largest passenger aircraft [AFP]

Australia’s Qantas Airways has resumed limited Airbus A380 superjumbo flights, three weeks after a mid-air engine blast grounded the fleet for intensive safety checks.

Alan Joyce, the chief executive of Qantas, joined the first leg of flight QF31 to London via Singapore, which left Sydney at 5:30 pm [0630 GMT] on Saturday with a full load of 453 passengers.

“It’s great that we can reintroduce the aircraft,” Joyce said.

“We are 100 per cent comfortable with the operation of the aircraft.”

Only two of Qantas’s A380s will initially return to service, with the airline taking delivery of two new superjumbos before the year’s end and another two in early 2011.

The planes remain barred from trans-Pacific flights to Los Angeles because of the extra engine thrust required.

Engine problems

Qantas suspended its six A380s, which fly long-haul routes to London and Los Angeles, after a superjumbo’s engine blew-up on November 4, forcing an emergency landing in Singapore.

Checks revealed problems with 16 of the total 24 Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines powering Qantas’s A380s – four per plane – meaning the turbines would have to be replaced or modified.

“The decision to restore A380 services follows an intensive Trent 900 engine inspection programme carried out in close consultation with Rolls-Royce and Airbus,” Qantas said in a statement this week.

“Together with the engine and aircraft manufacturers and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, Qantas is now satisfied that it can begin reintroducing A380s to its international network progressively.”

Qantas, which has never suffered a fatal crash in the jet age, had visiting English football star David Beckham pose on an A380 for the media this week, while Airbus ran full-page newspaper ads for the plane on Saturday."
Oil fire suspected in A380 failure | Arkansas Democrat Gazette - Arkansas Online,"Fri, 12 Nov 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMTAvbm92LzEyL29pbC1maXJlLXN1c3BlY3RlZC1hMzgwLWZhaWx1cmUtMjAxMDExMTIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"— Europe’s air safety regulator said Thursday that an oil fire may have caused an engine turbine failure on a Qantas superjumbo jet, and issued an emergency order requiring airlines to reexamine that type of Rolls-Royce engine and ground any planes with suspicious leaks.

The order by the European Aviation Safety Authority backed earlier indications from investigators that they suspect a turbine disc was the cause of last week’s engine failure on the Airbus A380, but was the first official mention of an oil fire preceding the engine’s disintegration.

The A380 engine failure shortly after takeoff from Singapore on Nov. 4 has raised concerns over the safety of the world’s biggest passenger airplane three years after its debut. The failure sent shrapnel slicing through the plane’s wing. Pilots made a safe emergency landing with 466 passengers and crew aboard.

Qantas said this week that it had found small oil leaks on Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines on three of its other Airbus A380s during tests after the Nov. 4 accident. The airline, Australia’s national carrier, said Thursday that it was keeping its six A380s grounded until further checks were completed - extending an earlier deadline.

Singapore Airlines on Wednesday grounded three of its 11 A380s after checks prompted by the Qantas accident revealed what the company called oil stains in the Trent 900 engines. Lufthansa also uses the A380-Trent 900 combination, but said Wednesday that its checks had not turned up anything untoward.

The European regulator said in a new “emergency airworthiness directive” posted on its website Thursday that airlines using Trent 900 engines should conduct “repetitive inspections” of them.

Twenty planes operated by Qantas, Germany’s Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines use the Trent 900 engines. Nine have been grounded: six Qantas jets and three Singapore Airlines jets.

The European Aviation Safety Authority said airlines should check several parts of the engines, including the oil service tubes, to ensure there is no “abnormal” leakage. If any such leaks are found, the airlines are prohibited from using the engines.

The directive was issued in response to the Qantas engine failure. The safety agency said an analysis of the investigation so far “shows that an oil fire” in part of the engine “may have caused the failure” of the engine’s intermediate pressure turbine disc.

“This condition, if not detected, could ultimately result in uncontained engine failure potentially leading to damage to the airplane and hazards to persons or property on the ground,” the directive said.

The Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which is taking the lead in the investigation, has focused on a mangled section of a shattered turbine disc that was recovered from the stricken plane. It has been sent to Britain for testing, with investigators coordinating with Rolls-Royce, the bureau said.

The Qantas and Singapore accidents are not the first problems Rolls-Royce has faced with its engines. In September 2009, a Singapore Airlines A380 was forced to return to Paris midflight after an engine malfunction. Last August, a Lufthansa crew shut down one of its engines as a precaution before landing in Frankfurt after receiving confusing information on a cockpit indicator.

Qantas airlines has announced that it will keep its Airbus A380 super-jumbos grounded for at least three more days after finding oil leaks in some engines. This follows a serious incident last week when an engine broke apart in mid flight, forcing the plane to make an emergency landing in Singapore.

Qantas Chief executive Alan Joyce said rigorous testing had uncovered the anomalies on the Rolls-Royce engines on three separate aircraft, pushing back the return to action of the long-haul planes by 72 hours.

""The oil leaks were beyond normal tolerances,"" Joyce told journalists in Sydney on Monday. ""All of these engines are new engines. At this stage, Qantas does not expect to operate the A380 fleet for at least another 72 hours.""

Qantas has not had a fatal jet crash in 90 years, but has suffered from two incidents in just a week.

In the second one, a Qantas Boeing 747 also had to turn back to Singapore after another model of Rolls-Royce engine also failed in mid-air.

The A380 is the world's biggest commercial jet, servicing lucrative routes from Los Angeles and London to Australia's major cities of Sydney and Melbourne.

A team of 10 experienced sports parachutists, including Enders and Bruno Delannoy, A400M programme manager for Europe's OCCAR procurement agency, took part in the test. They jumped from the aircraft's rear cargo ramp from an altitude of 12,000ft (3,660m) above the La Juliana drop zone near Seville, Spain. The skydivers involved had previously made a combined 35,000-plus descents, Airbus says.

Using MSN3, Airbus Military performed the first paradrop tests with an A400M near Toulouse, France on 4 November.

EADS expects a new development and production contract for the military transport to come into effect late this year, after receiving the required parliamentary approvals from European partner nations Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, Turkey and the UK. They will receive 170 A400Ms from early 2013 under the programme, with export customer Malaysia also to acquire four.

Airbus Military's current three development aircraft had been flown more than 230 times by early November and logged a combined 765 flight hours, the company says. MSN4 will join the flight test programme before the end of this year, with a fifth and final example to follow during 2011.

Airbus set to launch A320 NEO | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Tue, 30 Nov 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXNldC10by1sYXVuY2gtYTMyMC1uZW8vOTcxNjkuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus will launch a re-engined version of its A320 family aircraft Wednesday, for entry into service in 2016, say industry sources.

The A320 new engine option, or NEO, will be launched with variants of Pratt & Whitney's PW1000G and CFM Leap-X engines.

The 150-seat A320, the original member of the European airframer's narrowbody family first introduced in 1988, will be the first model offered with the new engine option.

Airbus expects to achieve up to 15% improvement in fuel burn with the new engines, which includes a 3.5% boost with new Sharklets, which enter service in 2012 with Air New Zealand.

The Pratt & Whitney PW1524G engine is scheudled for an entry into service in 2013 on the Bombardier CSeries CS100, the first of two 110 to 149-seat models offered by the Canadian aircraft maker, that are intended to compete with the Airbus A318, A319, Boeing 737-600 and -700.

CFM is currently set to introduce its Leap-X1C under the wing of the 160-seat Chinese Comac C919, which will see its first revenue service in 2016.

The Airbus decision comes after a protracted 'will they, won't they' debate over hanging new engines on the company's best selling models. Boeing still has yet to announce its future plans on its 737, though the decision by Airbus comes as both airframers are boosting production to record levels to satisfy global demand for short-haul aircraft.

Airbus has maintained that it will continue to offer its A320 powered by CFM56-5B and IAE V2500 engines along side those with the new engine option.

3 Airlines Halt A380 Flights Over Engine Explosion - BlueRidgeNow.com,"Fri, 05 Nov 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsdWVyaWRnZW5vdy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDEwLzExLzA1LzMtYWlybGluZXMtaGFsdC1hMzgwLWZsaWdodHMvMjgyNTY1NjYwMDcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"3 Airlines Halt A380 Flights Over Engine Explosion

HONG KONG — Three airlines suspended flights of Airbus A380 superjumbo jetliners on Thursday after an engine on a Qantas plane blew apart shortly after takeoff from Singapore.

Debris fell on an Indonesian island, and the plane, with more than 450 people aboard, spent 90 tense minutes circling with its three remaining engines, dumping fuel and preparing for an emergency landing back in Singapore. The episode ended with passengers cheering and praising the flight crew for maintaining calm. There were no reported injuries.

Justin Dubon, an Airbus spokesman in France, said it was the first uncontained engine failure and the most serious problem experienced by the A380, which entered service in 2007. Such a failure is extremely rare and occurs when components fly off the main engine housing, often with explosive force.

Qantas — Australia’s largest carrier — Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa each canceled flights. Qantas, with six of the A380s, and Singapore, with 11, grounded their fleets. Lufthansa, which has three A380s, called off a late-night flight from Frankfurt. On Friday morning, Singapore Airlines resumed flying its A380s.

The European Aviation Safety Agency, which regulates Airbus and the engine’s maker, Rolls-Royce, said it was working closely with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau to determine the cause. “We take this issue very seriously,” said Jeremie Teahan, an agency spokesman in Cologne, Germany.

The A380 can seat up to 800 passengers. Currently, 37 are being flown by five airlines. The 20 operated by Qantas, Singapore and Lufthansa all use the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine. Seventeen others operated by Air France and Emirates use a different engine.

The 37 planes have completed roughly 21,400 flights, said Mr. Dubon, the Airbus spokesman. Previous mechanical problems with the A380 have been relatively minor, involving fuel and braking systems, Mr. Dubon said.

Flight 32 was minutes into its route to Sydney when the engine blew out.

One passenger said he heard a noise “like a bang, like a shotgun going off, like a big, loud gun.”

“My whole body just went to jelly,” the passenger, Tyler Wooster, told Australia’s Nine Network, “and I didn’t know what was going to happen as we were going down, if we were going to be O.K.”

Passengers said the flight crew made frequent and reassuring announcements. Some took cellphone video of smoke pouring from under the left wing.

The flight was set upon by emergency crews after it returned to Changi International Airport in Singapore about 11:45 a.m. Local news media broadcast images of the charred No. 2 engine — the inside engine on the left wing — being doused by fire engines. Television images from the island of Batam in Indonesia showed people holding large chunks of metal, some bearing the red and white paint of the Qantas insignia.

Photographs taken by several passengers from inside the plane and posted on the Internet showed at least two large punctures on the upper side of the wing, with bits of metal skin protruding.

“It looks like there are a couple of pretty good sized holes with the metal blown out,” said William R. Voss, president of the Flight Safety Foundation, based in Alexandria, Va. “That almost certainly means that debris came up through the bottom of the wing.”

Alan Joyce, Qantas’s chief executive, said the airline would suspend the A380s “until we are confident that Qantas safety requirements have been met,” according to a statement on the airline’s Web site. But he said that the episode would not affect Qantas’s current order for 14 more A380s.

In a statement, Rolls-Royce, based in London, said the company felt it was “prudent to recommend that a number of basic precautionary engine checks are performed,” given that the Trent 900 engine had been in service for only three years. It added that “it would be inappropriate to draw any conclusions” so early in the investigation.

Nicholas Ionides, a Singapore Airlines spokesman, said that based on the Rolls-Royce advice, the airline was temporarily suspending flights by its A380s.

A Lufthansa spokesman, Aage Dünhaupt, said that an A380 that flew from Frankfurt on Thursday afternoon for Tokyo would undergo an inspection of its engines after landing on Friday. Josh Rosenstock, a Rolls-Royce spokesman, declined to give further details about the types of inspection it was recommending. (Rolls-Royce is a separate company from the carmaker, a subsidiary of BMW.)

The episode represents a fresh setback for Rolls-Royce after a different engine model, designed to power Boeing’s long-awaited 787 Dreamliner, had an uncontained failure that caused minor damage to a testing center in August. The failure of that engine, a Trent 1000, led Boeing to postpone deliveries for the 787 — already two years behind schedule — until early next year.

Qantas, an airline with a reputation for safety, has experienced several problems this year. In late March, a Qantas Boeing 747 bound for Singapore returned to Sydney after a pilot reported mechanical problems that affected one of the plane’s engines, according to Australian news media. On March 31, the airline reported that a brake had locked up as an A380 landed in Sydney, causing two tires to blow out.

On Aug. 31, the airline reported a “catastrophic failure” in an engine of a 747 flying from San Francisco to Sydney, according to the newspaper The Australian. The jetliner returned safely to San Francisco."

AFP - Qantas kept its Airbus A380 superjumbos grounded for at least three more days on Monday after finding oil leaks in some engines, reviving safety fears after two mid-air blow-outs last week.



Chief executive Alan Joyce said rigorous testing had uncovered the anomalies on the Rolls-Royce engines on three separate aircraft, pushing back the return to action of the long-haul planes by 72 hours.



""The oil leaks were beyond normal tolerances,"" Joyce told journalists in Sydney. ""All of these engines are new engines.""



""At this stage, Qantas does not expect to operate the A380 fleet for at least another 72 hours.""



Qantas's impeccable safety record -- the Australian flag-carrier has never had a fatal jet crash in 90 years -- has come into question after two engine explosions in as many days last week.



On Thursday, a Qantas Airbus A380 was forced to return to Singapore for an emergency landing after one of its four Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines exploded just minutes into its flight, showering an Indonesian town with debris.



And on Friday, a Qantas Boeing 747 -- which was carrying the A380's captain -- also had to turn back to Singapore after another model of Rolls-Royce engine also failed in mid-air.



Both flights, which were carrying a combined total of 897 passengers and crew, arrived safely back in Singapore but some of those onboard have spoken of their fear at hearing blasts as the engines failed.



""I just looked at my wife and held hands and I really thought I was going to die,"" New Zealander Hamzah Munif said of his experience on the Boeing 747-400 after returning to Sydney on Sunday.



But Swedish passenger Peter Geisler said he was not frightened by the malfunction which he described as ""no big deal"" given the aircraft was able to operate on its three other engines.



""I didn't hear any riots or people crying or anything,"" he told reporters.



Qantas's six A380s, the world's biggest commercial jet, service lucrative routes from Los Angeles and London to Australia's major cities of Sydney and Melbourne.



The grounding has forced the carrier -- which has refused to speculate on the cost of the operation -- to add extra services on some routes and use other aircraft to allow thousands of passengers to make their journeys.



Joyce said Qantas's A380s would not take to the skies until the airline was ""100 percent sure that we can assure the safety of our operations"".



""We are not going to take any risks whatsoever,"" he told reporters.



Qantas said last week an engine design flaw on the double-decker planes may be at fault, and Joyce said the oil leaks would help narrow investigations into the blast, which also caused damage to the wing and one other engine.



It was possible ""this is a problem with the engine not meeting its design criteria"", he said.



Joyce said Qantas, the only airline which has still grounded its A380s, took safety ""unbelievably seriously"" but he still expected the massive aircraft to be flying again within days.



""We still believe with the progress we are making -- this is days not weeks -- but we will take as long as it needs to in order that we are absolutely comfortable the aircraft is safe to fly,"" he told ABC Radio.



Qantas has angrily denied union claims that the problems may be linked to the outsourcing of maintenance work to companies abroad.



The incidents have overshadowed Qantas's anniversary celebrations which started on Saturday, with visiting ""ambassador-at-large"" and trained pilot John Travolta forced to defend the airline's safety record.



The Hollywood star said Qantas' pilot training was arduous ""and that's why you guys are so safe.""



Shares in the ""Flying Kangaroo"" shed 2.1 percent to 2.80 Australian dollars.

""Six freefall paratroopers made jumps from aircraft ""Grizzly Three"" in separate passes from 6,000ft [1,820m] at the Fonsorbes drop zone near Toulouse on 4 November,"" Airbus says.

The personnel were drawn from the UK and French armed forces, and from the latter's CEV flight test centre. Two jumped from the A400M's rear cargo ramp, and four from the aircraft's left-hand paratroop door.

Airbus says initial feedback received from the paratroops is that the A400M is ""easier to jump from than other transports"". The company cites the type's ability to fly at just 110kt (203km/h) during the drop procedure as a contributory factor.

Visible in the released image, the A400M's new side door deflectors were added to the development aircraft fleet after initial tests with the ramp and side doors open resulted in high noise levels and turbulence inside the cargo hold, says Fernando Alonso, Airbus Military's senior vice-president flight and integration test centre.

Conducted after initial tests using water-filled balloons and also followed by the release of instrumented dummies from static lines, the first paratroop jumps will lead to further trials scheduled to take place during 2011, Airbus says.

Each A400M will be able to carry up to 116 fully equipped paratroops once the delayed type enters operational service around 2013.

After reaching a new agreement in Toulouse last week, Airbus expects to sign a new production contract before year-end with its European launch customers Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, Turkey and the UK. The nations are now expected to take delivery of 170 production aircraft; 10 fewer than previously contracted for. Malaysia will also receive four examples under the company's lone export deal for the type.

The plans of thousands of long-haul travellers are still up in the air, nine days after an engine on a Qantas Airbus A380 from London to Sydney caught fire and broke up shortly after taking off from Singapore.

Within hours of the incident, the Australian airline grounded its entire fleet of six ""superjumbo"" aircraft, the largest in the world. The A380s are normally deployed on its flagship route, from Sydney and Melbourne to London and Los Angeles, and carry upwards of 20,000 passengers each week.

While travel industry figures in the UK have been complimentary at the way the Australian carrier has dealt with the repercussions of the grounding, one senior executive said a prolonged delay could ""wreak havoc"" on Christmas and New Year schedules. Qantas is making no promises about when its A380 fleet will be cleared for take-off, after several earlier forecasts proved wrong.

Information obtained by The Independent from the airline's reservations system shows that all flights due to be operated by the A380 for the next two weeks have been replaced by smaller and older Boeing 747 jumbo jets, with around 100 fewer seats.

Qantas has transferred some of the passengers booked to travel with them to other airlines, and chartered capacity from British Airways to take passengers from Heathrow to Hong Kong and Singapore.

To cope with the absence of its largest aircraft, Qantas has come up with a complex ""cascade"" plan – downsizing aircraft across a range of routes. Links from London and Los Angeles are being served by smaller Boeing 747s, some of them normally deployed on services from Sydney to Tokyo and Hong Kong. These jumbos have in turn been replaced by Airbus A330s, taken from routes such as Perth to Singapore – whose passengers will find themselves flying on some of Qantas's older Boeing 767 jets.

A statement from the airline said ""While Qantas is committed to bringing its A380s back into service as soon as possible, this contingency schedule has been designed to provide certainty for customers planning to travel in the near future.""

Qantas has also issued an opaque statement saying that ""engineers have been investigating the engines in detail and how their components and design perform under operational conditions – as opposed to the original out-of-factory expectations"".

The re-introduction, when it happens, could be protracted, according to David Learmont, operations and safety editor of Flight Global publications: ""They'll get the airplanes airborne one by one – they won't suddenly say the fleet is clear, they will clear them as they're ready.""

As the Qantas grounding continues, fares on some routes have increased – particularly across the Pacific. Short-notice flights in economy class between Australia and California are being sold at well over £1,000 each way. From the UK, fares over the next two weeks on Qantas and its alliance partner, British Airways, are £100 higher than usual.

The potential financial damage to Qantas goes beyond the immediate costs associated with the incident and its aftermath. The airline spent hundreds of millions of dollars on fitting out its A380s to offer the highest standards – way ahead of those offered aboard the substitute Boeing 747 aircraft. In addition, there is always a risk in transferring passengers to rivals that the customers may not come back if they find the alternative carriers to their liking.

Routes already affected

The Qantas grounding of the A380 has had some intriguing repercussions for passengers, particularly business travellers booking at short notice or backpackers on round-the-world trips who want to change their flight dates.

Heathrow-Singapore

The Qantas Airbus A380 used on this link has been replaced by a Qantas Boeing 747. Travellers who insist on the ""super-jumbo"" may switch to Singapore Airlines, which is still operating A380s on the route, but this could prove expensive.

Singapore-Sydney

Passengers booking short-notice trips on Qantas are likely to find the only available seats involve a change of plane in another Australian city, such as Adelaide or Brisbane. The alternative is to fly non-stop on British Airways or Singapore Airlines, which are using Boeing 747s and 777s, but seats on these airlines are selling at a premium.

Singapore-Melbourne

Qantas customers anxious to get from Singapore to Melbourne are being offered a no-frills flight on the Qantas subsidiary, JetStar. It uses a narrow-bodied A320 and stops en route in Darwin, taking over four hours longer than the non-stop. Singapore Airlines is the alternative non-stop choice."

A slide exhibiting the aircraft outlines targeted efficiency gains over the current A320. The NEO would have a fuel burn around 15% lower than variants now in production. The bypass ratio would increase from five in the present generation of engines to between nine and 12. Fan diameter rises from around 1,600mm (64in) to 2,025mm (81in).

The logos of powerplant manufacturers CFM International and Pratt & Whitney are prominent on the slide. Noticeably absent is that of IAE, a consortium in which P&W is partnered with Rolls-Royce, Japanese Aero Engine and MTU Aero Engines.

Airbus predicts a 15% reduction in specific fuel consumption from the new engines, and says its new sharklet winglets will add 3.5% in fuel-burn savings on long sectors, as well as improving field performance and noise levels.

Although the green livery looks good on the Airbus A310, A320, Boeing 737 and Boeing 767 fleet they currently fly, I think it looks best on the classic Tupolev TU-154 that they stopped flying in 2008. The TU-154’s were still flown under the GloBus livery which flew tourist flights until 2009.

In 2007 S7 put in an order for 15 Boeing 787 Dreamliners (would have loved to see that livery on a 787), but they were canceled in 2009 by S7. Just this month S7 was added to the Oneworld alliance, sponsored by British Airways.

Qantas and Singapore Airlines have grounded their fleets of A380 aircraft after “significant engine failure” caused an Airbus superjumbo operated by Qantas to make an emergency landing in Singapore on Thursday.

REUTERS - Qantas Airways and Singapore Airlines suspended flights of Airbus A380 superjumbos on Thursday after engine failure forced an emergency landing in Singapore.

One passenger reported hearing a ""massive bang"" before the aircraft turned back and Indonesian TV showed pictures of debris on the ground near Batam airport which it said belonged to the Qantas plane.

Authorities said none of the 459 people on board the Qantas flight was hurt in the most serious incident for the world's largest passenger plane in three years of commercial flight.

""THERE WAS A BANG, AND THEN ANOTHER BANG"" ""This was a significant engine failure,"" Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce told reporters in Sydney. ""We are not underestimating the significance of this issue.""

Qantas A380s use Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines. Rolls-Royce, whose shares were down more than 5 percent, said it was working with authorities to understand the incident.

Planemaker Airbus said it will provide full technical assistance to Australian and French accident investigators.

One of the Airbus A380's four Rolls-Royce engines failed minutes after it had left Singapore for Sydney. Qantas CEO Joyce said the plane was capable of flying on two engines.

Passengers said they saw parts of the engine fall off.

""I just heard this massive bang, like a shotgun going off,"" Tyler Wooster told Australia's Network Nine television. ""Part of the skin had peeled off and you could see the foam underneath, pieces of broken wires sticking out."" The flight had begun in London.

Qantas, which operates six A380s, said it was grounding the aircraft pending a full investigation. Three A380 flights scheduled for Thursday, one originating in Sydney and two in Los Angeles, have been scrapped.

""We will suspend all A380 takeoffs until we are fully confident we have sufficient information about (flight) QF32,"" Joyce told reporters.

Singapore Airlines said it will delay all flights on its A380 fleet pending precautionary checks recommended by Airbus and Rolls-Royce. It was not immediately clear how many flights would be affected or for how long.

Investigation

The Australian Transport Safety Bureau was leading the investigation into the incident, Joyce said. Passengers will stay in Singapore overnight and another plane will be dispatched for them on Friday morning.

Initial media reports said the plane had crashed after an explosion over the Indonesian island of Batam, near Singapore.

There have been no fatal incidents involving A380s since they were launched in 2005 as the greenest, quietest -- as well as the biggest -- jetliner. Shares in Airbus parent company EADS were down more than 4 percent by 1245 GMT. Qantas shares were little changed.

Emirates said it was not considering suspending flights as its engines are from a different supplier. European airlines Air France and Lufthansa said they would continue to use the aircraft as normal.

The plane involved in the incident was built in 2008.

More than 200 orders have been placed for the A380, and 37 are in operation worldwide, according to Airbus. The plane cost $17 billion to develop and has been dogged by production delays.

Qantas has never had a fatal accident. A mid-air explosion blew a minivan-size hole in the side of a Qantas 747-400 in 2008 which Australian air safety investigators blamed on an oxygen bottle.

One of the planes operated by Qantas burst two tyres this year when landing in Sydney, and in September 2009 an A380 was forced to turn around in mid-flight and return to Paris.

""This is probably the most serious incident involving the A380 since it began flying in commercial service,"" said aviation expert Tom Ballantyne, chief correspondent of Orient Aviation magazine. ""There have been minor engine incidents before but nothing like this.""

Singapore's Channel NewsAsia said the plane circled Singapore to burn fuel before making an emergency landing.

Former aircraft engineer Neil Shephard was on board.

""Four or five minutes after the flight (took off) there was a loud bang,"" he told Reuters. ""The pilot said there was a technical issue with the plane and then we circled around for an hour to dump the fuel. During the landing, it was a bit wobbly.""

Passengers were kept informed at all times, others who were on board said.

""It appears from the images of the plane that one of the engines has experienced a failure and it looks to be a fairly massive internal failure at that,"" said Peter Marosszeky at the University of New South Wales' aviation department.

""This failure has caused some of the engine ducting known as bypass ducting to depart from the engine. This type of incident has been seen previously but it was a long time ago and with much older planes than the A380.""

A Reuters reporter said the plane was surrounded on the ground by emergency vehicles but there was no sign of any smoke or fire. One of the four nacelles -- structures that house the engines -- was missing and there appeared to be charring around that area of the plane.

Rusdi, a witness in Batam, told Indonesia's Metro TV: ""After an explosion, the plane was still moving but smoke was trailing from one of its wings.""

Indonesian volcano Mount Merapi has erupted several times in the past week, spewing ash into the sky, but is several hundred miles from the A380's flightpath.

Thursday's incident came just days before Qantas was due to celebrate its 90th anniversary with a special open day in Brisbane.

Qantas to replace half of its Rolls-Royce A380 superjumbo engines - The Guardian,"Thu, 18 Nov 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEwL25vdi8xOC9xYW50YXMtcmVwbGFjZXMtcm9sbHMtcm95Y2UtZW5naW5lc9IBVGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEwL25vdi8xOC9xYW50YXMtcmVwbGFjZXMtcm9sbHMtcm95Y2UtZW5naW5lcw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rolls-Royce's troubles deepened today after Australia's Qantas announced that half of the engines made by the British firm on Airbus A380 superjumbos needed to be replaced. Germany's Lufthansa also had to replace a second engine on one of its aircraft.

A Qantas A380 flying from London to Sydney was forced to make an emergency landing two weeks ago when one of its four Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines blew out.

The Australian airline has since grounded its six A380s, while rival Singapore Airlines, which operates 11 of the Rolls-Royce powered aircraft, has recalled three of them and cancelled some flights after discovering oil leaks.

Alan Joyce, Qantas chief executive, said: ""We've been talking to Airbus and Rolls-Royce and we understand that the number [of engines to be replaced] is around 40. We've already replaced three, and there could be more.""

Lufthansa, which replaced a turbine last week as a ""precautionary measure,"" decided to replace a second Rolls engine after discovering a part that could be linked to the Qantas explosion. This will not affect flight schedules. The German carrier said it would continue to perform checks every 10 flight cycles, as required by the European Aviation Safety Agency.

There are 37 A380s in operation worldwide. Twenty of the $350m superjumbos are powered by the Trent 900.

A week ago, Rolls-Royce said it had identified a single faulty part responsible for the Qantas engine explosion over Indonesia. It started a programme to inspect all Trent 900s in service and either repair them or replace the faulty part, so that the entire A380 fleet could be brought back into service. Some faulty engines will be removed and replaced temporarily with new ones while the leaking part is being fixed. The old engine will then be refitted in the plane.

Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, chief executive of Air France-KLM, said: ""I have no doubt whatsoever that Rolls-Royce will deal with this issue, and that the problem will be completely resolved within a few weeks or months.""

Joyce declined to confirm an Australian newspaper report that his airline's six A380s were likely to remain grounded until December or later.

But he did confirm it wanted Airbus to replace some of its existing engines with new ones from aircraft still on the assembly line. The problem with the Trent 900 is thought to develop over time, so the new engines should not present safety issues and will give Rolls-Royce time to come up with a permanent solution. Airbus has orders for almost 200 A380s.

Airbus said todayit would seek full compensation from Rolls-Royce for any costs incurred. Rolls warned last week that the problems would hit its profits this year. Shares in the world's second-largest maker of aircraft engines edged 4p higher to 603.5p.

The A380 programme has already suffered a number of delays. Airbus was due to deliver more than a dozen Rolls-Royce-powered aircraft – mainly to Singapore Airlines, Qantas and Lufthansa – by the end of next year."
Qantas A380 landing: Airlines were warned in August over engine safety - The Guardian,"Thu, 04 Nov 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEwL25vdi8wNC9haXJidXMtYTM4MC1xYW50YXMtc2luZ2Fwb3JlLWVuZ2luZdIBVGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEwL25vdi8wNC9haXJidXMtYTM4MC1xYW50YXMtc2luZ2Fwb3JlLWVuZ2luZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Two airlines grounded their fleets of Airbus A380 superjumbos today following an emergency landing by a Qantas plane after one of its engines blew apart in mid-air, damaging a wing and showering debris on the ground below.

It emerged tonight that in August Europe's air safety watchdog issued an alert about abnormal wear inside the British-made Rolls Royce engines used on the huge, double-decker planes, though experts said it was too early to tell if the two were connected.

Flight QF32 from London to Sydney had just taken off from a stopover in Singapore when the plane suffered what the Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, described as a ""significant engine failure"".

Passengers described a loud bang and a flash of flame. They then saw part of the casing of engine apparently stripped away, and a small hole in the wing. Dozens of pieces of debris, believed to be from the engine, were found on the Indonesian island of Batam. ""There were flames, yellow flames came out, and debris came off. You could see black things shooting through the smoke, like bits of debris,"" said passenger Rosemary Hegardy.

While the plane, carrying 433 passengers and 26 crew, was able to circle to dump fuel before landing safely at Singapore's Changi airport shortly before midday local time, Qantas – famous, thanks to the film Rain Man, for its enviable safety record – announced it was grounding its A380s. Experts from the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch flew to Singapore yesterday to help the inquiry.

""We do take our safety reputation unbelievably seriously and we're not going to take risks with passenger safety,"" Joyce said. ""As a precaution, we're suspending flights of the A380."" Early this morning Singapore Airlines said its A380 services would continue as technical checks had been completed. Lufthansa was conducting checks without interrupting flights. Two other airlines that fly the A380 use other engines.

The incident – the most serious safety scare involving the world's biggest airliner in its three years of service – is a particular worry for Rolls Royce, which makes the Trent 900 engines fitted to most A380s at its Derby factory. The company, which lost more than 5% of its share price today, said it was working with airlines to see what went wrong. It refused to discuss the directive issued by the European Aviation Safety Agency in August which warned that scrutiny of stripped Trent 900s had found that unusual wear on splines used to secure the turbines could lead to engine failure coupled with ""oil migration and oil fire""."
Airbus engine failure warning weeks before Qantas scare - Channel 4 News,"Thu, 04 Nov 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYW5uZWw0LmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1lbmdpbmUtZmFpbHVyZS13YXJuaW5nLXdlZWtzLWJlZm9yZS1xYW50YXMtc2NhcmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Exclusive: Channel 4 News reveals the Rolls-Royce engines used on the Airbus A380 were identified as “potentially unsafe” weeks before a Qantas jet was forced to make an emergency landing.

The double-decker Qantas plane made an emergency landing in Singapore after one of its engines shut-down in mid-air.

All 459 people on the “Superjumbo” plane, which was flying to Australia, were uninjured, and a Qantas statement said they were now investigating what caused the problems with the aircraft.

We are obviously taking this very seriously, because it was a significant engine failure. Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce

It has grounded its remaining Airbus A380 fleet while it works with Airbus and the engine manufacturer, Rolls-Royce, to find out the cause of the incident.

Singapore Airlines has also delayed all Airbus A380 flights.

Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said: “We will suspend all A380 take offs until we are fully confident we have sufficient information about [flight] QF32… The A380 is a fantastic aircraft. This issue of an engine failure is one we have not seen before.

“We are obviously taking this very seriously, because it was a significant engine failure.”

While everyone, quite rightly, is warning against speculation over the cause of the engine failure that caused the Qantas A380 Airbus to make an emergency landing at Singapore, Channel 4 News can reveal only a month ago airlines were warned of a turbine problem with the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines used on the A380 planes now in service with Qantas, Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa, and which will power British Airways’ planes when they are delivered.

In August, the European Aviation Safety Authority (EASA) issued an Airworthiness Directive warning of increased wear on a coupling on the engine’s Intermediate Pressure shaft that “present a potential unsafe condition to the aeroplane”.

The coupling allows the axial setting of the turbine to be controlled and the directive says the increased wear would allow the Intermediate Pressure turbine to move rearwards which “would enable contact with static turbine components and would result in loss of engine performance with potential for in-flight shut down”.

That’s dry engineering-speak for a potentially catastrophic in-flight engine failure where turbine blades, spinning at high velocity, smash into the casing or other solid parts of the engine and shatter explosively, much as passengers on board the Qantas flight have described. Fire, from escaping fuel and oil is often the result.

See the Airworthiness Directive in full here

'I was just waiting for us to start going down'

Passenger Tyler Wooster, from Melbourne, Australia, told Channel 4 News: ""All of a sudden I heard a big shotgun-like bang, just a massive bang. It wasn't like a fire, it was just like the top split open and it became a little smoky. I could see the wires hanging out, it didn't look good.



""Everyone was shocked, everyone was wondering what was going to happen. I was just waiting for us to start going down. I could see the skin peeling off the wing - that was pretty nerve-wracking.



""After about three minutes the pilot told us we were running on three engines and everything was fine. Then we had to fly around in circles to get rid of fuel.



""When we landed we finished right on the end of the tarmac - it was a real uncomfortable landing. When we landed everyone was cheering and clapping.""



Modern aero engines, of course, are designed to withstand such failures and contain the blow-out and the shattered turbine blades and, in the case of Qantas Flight QF32 that seems to have been successful.

The EASA ordered more frequent inspections of the critical parts and corrective action where necessary.

Air accident investigators will inevitably want to inspect these parts of the damaged engine closely, and will check Qantas maintenance records to confirm the inspections had been carried out.

Investigators will be trying to establish exactly what happened to the Qantas engine and if a problem such as the one identified here could have occurred. Rolls Royce declined to comment when contacted by Channel 4 News.

A top aircraft engineer in Australia told Channel 4 News that the “most likely scenario”, based on the amount of information available so far, was a problem with the engine.

Paul Cousins, president of the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association, said: “The pictures we have seen suggest, it looks like a turbine disc has given way in the rear of the aircraft and broke off and looks like that came out and caused panels of the engine to come off.

“That would make that kind of bang that passengers heard.”

What the captain said - announcement to passengers:

""I do apologise, I'm sure you're aware we have a technical issue with our number two engine.



""We have dealt with the situation - the aircraft is secure at this stage. We're going to have to hold for some time while we lighten our load by dumping some fuel and [there are] a number of checks we have to perform.



""I'm sure you are aware we're not proceeding to Sydney at this stage, we're making a left turn now to track back towards Singapore.



""As we progress with this we'll keep you informed. At this stage everything is secure - the aircraft is flying safely. We'll get back to you very shortly with further information.""



""Thank you for your patience.""

Mr Cousins said the damage on the aircraft did not tally with other potential causes – such as a bird striking the plane.

“Both Rolls Royce and Airbus will be taking a keen interest in what has gone on, and Qantas will make sure they have a keen interest, because when something like this happens it damages the reputation of all three organisations, and if there is a manufacturing defect it needs to be fixed,” he added. He also said maintenance was an issue.

“It’s only an initial observation but we also would have concerns over maintenance,” he said. “We would want to know the maintenance history of that aircraft.”"
Qantas CEO says 'faulty design' may be behind engine failure - The Guardian,"Fri, 05 Nov 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDEwL25vdi8wNS9xYW50YXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtZmF1bHR5LWRlc2lnbtIBTmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDEwL25vdi8wNS9xYW50YXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtZmF1bHR5LWRlc2lnbg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qantas said the mid-air blowout near Singapore on one of its Airbus superjumbos was likely caused by material failure or faulty design in one of its Rolls-Royce engines, as the carrier ferried stranded passengers to Australia today.

The Qantas CEO, Alan Joyce, told a news conference in Sydney that it was too early to say exactly what caused the engine failure that prompted the emergency landing on Thursday shortly after takeoff from Singapore, and said that a thorough investigation was under way.

The company grounded all six of its fleet of Airbus A380s.

""This is an engine issue and the engines have been maintained by Rolls-Royce since they were installed on the aircraft,"" Joyce said. ""We believe this is probably most likely a material failure or some type of design issue. We don't believe this is related to maintenance in any way.""

It was most serious mid-air incident involving the double-decker Airbus A380 since it debuted in October 2007 with Singapore Airlines flying it to Sydney the same route that Qantas flight QF32 was flying when it was stricken.

Passengers were put on a relief flight bound for Australia on Friday morning, a day after the A380 suffered an engine blowout soon after taking off from Singapore, shooting flames and shedding large metal chunks over an Indonesian island.

It later made a safe emergency landing in Singapore, and Qantas grounded all six of its A380s.

""We have just taken off now. The flight was slightly delayed but we are told to expect a fast short flight of 6 hours 45 minutes,"" passenger Matthew Hewitt said in a text message. Other passengers earlier said some of them were flying on two scheduled Qantas flights to Perth and Sydney, which had already left.

The A380 was carrying 440 passengers and 26 crew. Qantas had earlier said the plane was carrying 433 passengers but corrected the number on Friday without an explanation.

After the plane touched down in Singapore, the engine closest to the fuselage on the left wing had visible burn marks and was missing a plate section that would have been painted with the red kangaroo logo of the airline. The upper part of the left wing also appeared damaged, indicating that one or more pieces from the engine gouged a hole in the wing.

Passenger amateur video from inside the plane showed white vapour coming out of the wing as the A380 landed."

This is known as ""hub and spoke"". By contrast, Boeing has gone the other way with ""point to point"", betting that airlines will use smaller aircraft flying direct to passengers final destinations."

Emirates, whose outstanding orders for the 777 will make it the twin-jet's biggest user, needs higher-capacity aircraft for its longest intercontinental routes, Tim Clark, the Dubai-based airline's president, said today in an interview in Paris.

Clark has ordered 20 350-seat A350-1000s, a model he says can't reach Los Angeles from Dubai in the three-class layout that Emirates prefers. The Boeing planes that it currently uses on the route are based on a less efficient 20-year-old design, with the 354-seat 777-300ER at the limits of its range, curbing the payload, and the 777-200LR limited to 266 people."

Singapore Airlines is switching three of its A380 engines as a “precautionary” measure [EPA]

Singapore Airlines says it will be changing its A380 Rolls Royce engines in the wake of the incident during a Qantas flight.

Singapore Airlines (SIA) announced on Wednesday that it plans to switch the engines on three of its Airbus A380 planes as a “precautionary” measure after finding oil stains on them, almost a week after Qantas, its Australian rival, grounded its own A380 fleet due to an engine failure.

“Based on further analysis of inspection findings as the investigation into last week’s incident involving another operator’s Airbus A380 is progressing, Singapore Airlines will be carrying out precautionary engine changes on three A380s,” the carrier said in a statement.

Lufthansa, a German airline, also said it would change one of its three Airbus A380 planes following talks with Rolls-Royce.

“This has nothing to do with oil leaks detected in engines of Qantas and Singapore Airlines” a spokesman for the airline told the AFP news agency.

Qantas’s six A380s have been grounded for nearly a week, when a Rolls Royce engine partly disintegrated mid-flight, forcing the plane to make an emergency landing.

The incident has triggered investigations into oil leaks inside the Rolls Royce Trent engines – the same model used to power Singapore Airlines’ A380 fleet.

Rolls Royce moved to limit the crisis of confidence on Monday, saying it was making progress in finding out what caused last week’s blowout on the Qantas flight.

‘Design flaw’

Singapore Airlines said the oil stains were unrelated to the Qantas problems.

“We apologise to our customers for flights disruptions that may result,” a spokesperson for the airline said.

Singapore Airlines said the three A380s would be equipped with new engines of the same model, with a minor variation. A380 flights out of Melbourne and Sydney were cancelled on Wednesday.

Qantas said last week that a design flaw could be to blame for the engine explosion on a Sydney-bound flight.

Shukor Yusof, an aviation analyst for Standard and Poor, said the ongoing problems with the engines would give the Airbus A380’s reputation “a bit of a dent, given this is the flagship carrier of SIA, Emirates and other airlines”.

“The incident has been detrimental to the image of the A380s and casts a shadow on the residual value of the aircraft… given that it is relatively new in the market,” he said.

Rolls Royce shares have tumbled since the Qantas A380 plane was forced to make its emergency landing in Singapore.

On Tuesday, the British firm – which had kept a low profile since the incident last week – said they were making progress in understanding the cause of the blowout.

“It is now clear this incident is specific to the Trent 900 engine,” it said in a statement on Wednesday.

“As a result, a series of checks and inspections has been agreed with Airbus, with operators of the Trent 900 powered A380 and with the airworthiness authorities,” it added.

“These are being progressively completed, which is allowing a resumption of operation of aircraft in full compliance with all safety standards”."

Accident: Qantas A388 near Singapore on Nov 4th 2010, uncontained engine failure

By Simon Hradecky, created Thursday, Nov 4th 2010 05:51Z, last updated Wednesday, May 18th 2011 15:12Z

VH-OQA after landing (Photo: AFP) A Qantas Airbus A380-842, registration VH-OQA performing flight QF-32 from Singapore (Singapore) to Sydney,NS (Australia) with 440 passengers and 26 crew, was climbing out of Singapore overhead the Indonesian Island of Batam about 20nm south of Singapore about 6 minutes into the flight when the #2 engine (Trent 972, inboard left hand) emitted a loud bang suffering from an uncontained failure. Debris with the Qantas logo fell onto a road in built up city district Dutamas of Batam. The airplane dumped fuel, returned to Singapore and landed safely about 2 hours after departure, gear doors were open, slats retracted, flaps extended. No injuries on board and on the ground in Batam were reported.



After landing fire services foamed engine #1 (outboard left hand) to shut that engine down.



Residents on the ground in Batam reported hearing a bang like an explosion before the debris came down onto a main road just south of the city center of Batam. The occurrence had even sparked rumours the airplane may have crashed.



Some of the debris including a turbine disk struck through the walls of a house on the ground in Batam.



Qantas said, that the crew shut the #2 engine down as a precaution and returned to Singapore. There is no suggestion that the debris in Batam came from their airplane.



Qantas said in a later updated statement, that all their Airbus A380-800 will remain on the ground until sufficient information has been obtained what happened on QF-32. The passengers disembarked in Singapore and were taken to hotels, replacement aircraft are being dispatched to Singapore to carry the passengers to Sydney, they are expected to reach Sydney during Nov 5th. Australia's ATSB has been notified.



On Nov 8th Qantas reported, that during checks of all Trent 970 and 972 engines they have identified three engines in Qantas' fleet of A380s that showed slight anomalies, oil in areas were no oil should be. In another press release Qantas reported that the investigation into the uncontained engine failure focusses on the possibility of an oil leak in the turbine area though investigation continues into other areas as well to rule out other possible issues. Qantas does not expect the A380s back in service within the next 3 days, however within 24 hours all services should be back to normal and disruptions to passengers due to the grounding of the Qantas A380 should cease.



Engineers reported on Nov 6th, that the intermediate pressure turbine disk of engine #2 had failed. The cause of that failure is still being investigated. Once on the ground the crew noticed they could not shut down the #1 engine due to wiring damage. Emergency services doused the engine to shut it down. The Trent 900 engine has been subject to an Airworthiness Directive by EASA requiring the intermediate pressure shaft coupling splines to be inspected for excessive wear, which was found beyond material limits on a few engines. Engineers are looking whether these problems have resurfaced again, but do not believe this engine failure is related.



Australia's Transportation Safety Board (ATSB) said, an investigation is in progress reporting that shortly after takeoff from Singapore the aircraft experienced a #2 engine failure, dumped fuel and returned to Singapore. The airplane sustained substantial damage.



On Nov 5th the ATSB reported, that the Indonesian NTSC delegated the investigation so that the ATSB will lead the investigation and prepare a factual preliminary report by Dec 3rd 2010. Four Australian accident investigators have reached Singapore, downloaded the cockpit voice and flight data recorder data. The airplane took off at 9:57L, about 4 minutes later abnormal engine #2 indications occurred and the engine shut down at 10:01L. The airplane dumped fuel and landed at 11:47L. The engine is about to be removed from the aircraft for further analysis, the investigators are inspecting the aircraft for other damage, too. The parts fallen onto Indonesian territory were quarantained for further examination.



On Nov 7th the ATSB confirmed that parts of a turbine disk (see picture below) have been recovered in Indonesia with the help of the Indonesian NTSC.



On Nov 13th the ATSB reported, that engine #2 has been removed from the airframe and is being transported to an engineering facility in Singapore under ATSB supervision for further examination. The removal of the engine also permits a more thorough examination of the damage to the surrounding systems and the wing. The search for missing engine parts in Batam (see picture below) is increasingly difficult because of terrain and virgin jungle. Both black boxes have been downloaded, in addition the quick access recorder data including engine parameters not available on the flight data recorder have been downloaded after some difficulty. Due to the failure of shutting engine #1 down, which kept power supply up for the CVR, the relevant portion during the engine failure on the cockpit voice recorder was overwritten. The ATSB has already begun to prepare the release of a first interim report by December 3rd.



On Nov 17th the ATSB reported, that the engine has been removed from the aircraft (see photos below) and is now being dismantled. The low pressure turbine has already been removed to allow examination of the damage in the intermediate pressure turbine area. The aircraft examination is continuing, a number of wing and body fairing panels have been removed from the aircraft to facilitate the examination of the underlying structures and systems. This work is going to continue at least for the remainder of the week. The search in Batam for debris has recovered several turbine blades and blade attachments but failed to retrieve the missing parts of the turbine disk.



On Nov 22nd the ATSB reported, that the low pressure and intermediate pressure turbine modules including the shafts have been removed from the engine. Together with the recovered parts of the intermediate pressure turbine those parts of interest are being shipped to Rolls Royce for further examination under the supervision of the British AAIB. The examination of the airframe is continuing with the focus now on hydraulic, mechanical and electric systems that have been affected by engine debris. The ATSB expects their on-site investigators will be able to return to Australia by Friday Nov 26th. No further update is to be expected until the release of the preliminary report on Dec 3rd.



On Dec 2nd 2010 the ATSB released a safety recommendation to Rolls Royce demanding RR should address a safety issue with the manufacturing process of stub pipes, that were identified with an axial misalignment of an area of counter-boring within the inner diameter of the stub pipe leading to a localized thinning of the pipe wall on one side. The ATSB reported, that fatigue cracking had been discovered within a stub pipe (see picture below) feeding oil into the HP/IP (high pressue/intermediate pressure) bearing structure. While investigation of the engine failure is continuing it has been identified that the leakage of oil into the HP/IP bearing structure buffer space and a subsequent oil fire within that area was central to the engine failure and liberation of the IP turbine disk. The area of fatigue cracking was associated with the area of pipe wall thinning.



Indonesia's Ministry of Transport said, that the airplane although being overhead Batam about 5 minutes after takeoff was still in the responsibility of Singapore's Air Traffic Control, when the aircraft suffered an engine failure and requested to return to Singapore. The airplane subsequently dumped fuel above the waters near waypoint HOSBA (25nm east of Singapore Airport, 22nm northeast of Batam Airport). The airplane landed safely in Singapore at 03:46Z (11:46L).



Indonesia's Ministry of Transport later summarized the incident stating, that the aircraft was overhead Batam landmass when the crew issued a PAN call to Singapore Approach reporting a possible engine failure. The crew requested to level off at 7500 feet MSL and a heading of about 150 degrees to investigate the occurrence. About 20 minutes later the crew reported they had gone through an extensive checklist, found there was a hole in the (inboard) side of engine #2 and there was damage to the wing. The crew requested to hold for half an hour before returning to Singapore. In the meantime Batam's air traffic control received calls from the ground about debris on the ground and relayed the information to Singapore's approach controller. The crew reported, that apart from engine #2 all other engines were working normally. The crew requested an approach to runway 20C at Singapore's Changi Airport. After coming to a stop at the end of the runway the crew requested towing assistance. Responding emergency services found a fuel leak off the left hand wing, engine #2 was damaged near the rear of the engine, smoke was coming from tyre #7 and 4 tyres had deflated, the pilot was not able to shut engine #1 down. It was safe nonetheless to have the passengers disembark. All passengers had disembarked by 13:54L and engine #1 was finally shut down by emergency services at 14:53L.



Airbus reported, that VH-OQA suffered an engine failure shortly after takeoff from Singapore, dumped fuel and returned to Singapore. The airplane (MSN: 14) had accumulated 8,165 flight hours in 831 cycles since new (Sep 2008), the #2 engine had accumulated 676 flight cycles since new.



Airbus later reported, that the aircraft sustained wiring cuts, the loss of the green hydraulic system and some structural damage as result of the #2 engine uncontained failure. The crew maintained control of the aircraft throughout the flight with autopilot being engaged until 700 feet radar altitude on approach to Singapore, engines #1, #3 and #4 were manually controlled until landing. The landing was done with flaps configuration 3 due to slats being unavailable. The aircraft landed 100 minutes after the engine failure, following the landing engine #1 could not be shut down due to wiring damage which prevented the LP and HP valves to be closed.



Rolls Royce reported on Nov 8th that they are making progress in understanding what caused the failure of the Qantas engine. It has become clear that this failure is specific to the Trent 900 series, the failure of the test Trent 1000 was unrelated.



On Nov 10th the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued an Emergency Airworthiness Directive for all Trent 900 engines reporting that ""an oil fire in the HP/IP structure cavity may have caused the failure of the Intermediate Pressure Turbine (IPT) Disk"". The EAD requires extensive inspections within the next 10 flight cycles to be repeated within every 20 flight cycles.



On Nov 12th Rolls Royce said in a press release that the examination of the accident engine as well as the inspection results permitted Rolls Royce to draw two key conclusions:



- The issue is specific to the Trent 900 engine series.

- The failure was confined to a specific component in the turbine area of the engine. This caused an oil fire, which led to the release of the intermediate pressure turbine disc.



The inspections are going to continue and will be supplemented by the replacement of the relevant module according to an agreed programme.



The Rolls Royce Trent 972 engine is currently used only by Qantas for their Airbus A380s. The engine delivers 72k lbs of thrust compared to the Trent 970 used by other Rolls Royce A380 operators, that delivers 70k lbs of thrust.

Contributing safety factors



- Over time, a fatigue crack had developed in the thin-wall section of the oil feed stub pipe in the No. 2 engine to the extent that, during the occurrence flight, opening of the crack through normal movement within the engine released oil into the HP/IP buffer space.



- Auto-ignition of the oil leaking from the oil feed stub pipe created an intense and sustained fire within the HP/IP buffer space that resulted in localised heat damage to the intermediate pressure (IP) turbine disc.



- The IP turbine disc separated from the drive arm and accelerated.



- Following the separation of the IP turbine disc from the drive arm, the engine behaved in a manner that differed from the engine manufacturers modelling and experience with other engines in the Trent family, with the result that the IP turbine disc accelerated to a rotational speed in excess of its design capacity whereupon it burst in a hazardous manner. [Safety issue]



- During the manufacture of the HP/IP bearing support assembly fitted to the No. 2 engine (serial number 91045), movement of the hub during the machining processes resulted in a critically reduced wall thickness within the counter bore region of the oil feed stub pipe.



- It was probable that a non-conformance in the location of the oil feed stub pipe interference bore was reported by the coordinate measuring machine during the manufacturing process, but that the non-conformance was either not detected or not declared by inspection personnel, resulting in the assembly being released into service with a reduced wall thickness in the oil feed stub pipe.



- The statistical analysis used to estimate maximum likely oil feed stub pipe counter bore misalignment, and resulting thin wall section, did not adequately represent the population of actual misalignments in engines already released into service, nor did it implicitly provide a level of uncertainty in the results.



- The language used to define the size of the non-conformance on the retrospective concession form did not effectively communicate the uncertainty of the statistical analysis to those assessing and approving the concession.



- The engine manufacturer did not have a requirement for an expert review of statistical analyses used in retrospective concession applications. [Safety issue]



- The engine manufacturer's process for retrospective concessions did not specify when in the process the Chief Engineer and Business Quality Director approvals were to be obtained. Having them as the final approval in the process resulted in an increased probability that the fleet-wide risk assessment would not occur. [Safety issue]



- The retrospective concession was not approved by the Chief Engineer and Business Quality Director, as required by the group quality procedures relating to retrospective concessions, denying them the opportunity to assess the risk to the in-service fleet.



Other Safety Factors



- Numerous other engines within the Trent 900 fleet were also found to contain a critical reduction in the oil feed stub pipe wall thickness. [Safety issue]



- During preparation of the manufacturing process for the HP/IP bearing support assembly structure, a manufacturing datum was introduced because the location of the oil feed stub pipe counter bore could not be referenced to the design definition datum. That manufacturing datum was not constrained to the location of the oil feed stub pipe and as such could not ensure that the counter bore was concentric with the stub pipe, as the designers had intended.



- The engine manufacturer did not require its manufacturing engineers to consult with the design engineers to ensure that design intent would be maintained when introducing manufacturing datums. [Safety issue]



- The use by an inspector, during the first article inspection process, of the manufacturing stage drawings to verify the oil feed stub pipe counter bore features precluded the inspection from showing that the manufacturing process could produce an item that conformed to the design definition, or the intention of the design.



- The procedure for the first article inspection process contained ambiguities that resulted in an interpretation whereby the use of the manufacturing stage drawings was deemed to be acceptable. [Safety issue]



- A culture existed within the engine manufacturer's Hucknall facility where it was considered acceptable to not declare what manufacturing personnel determined to be minor non-conformances in manufactured components. [Safety issue]



- The coordinate measuring machine was programmed to measure the location of the oil feed stub pipe interference bore with respect to the manufacturing datum, instead of the design definition datum as specified on both the design and manufacturing stage drawings. [Safety issue]



- During the production of a number of HP/IP bearing support assemblies, the coordinate measuring machine identified a non-conformance in the location of the oil feed stub pipe interference bore.



- It was likely that when making the determination that the non-conforming HP/IP bearing support assemblies were acceptable for use, the manufacturing personnel did not know that the coordinate measuring machine referenced a different datum to the design definition drawings and unknowingly released thin-walled pipes into service based on an alternative (wire gauge) measurement method.



- The engine manufacturers group quality procedures did not provide any guidance on how manufacturing personnel were to determine the significance of a non-conformance, from a quality assurance perspective. [Safety issue]



- When the retrospective concession was processed, the non-conformance was not reported to the Quality Review Board because manufacturing personnel did not identify it as a significant non-conformance.



- The manufacturers classification, relating to the criticality of failure, of the HP/IP bearing support assembly was inappropriate for the effects of a fire within the buffer space and hence, the requirement for an appropriate level of process control was not communicated to the manufacturing staff. [Safety issue]



- The partial first article inspection carried out in 2009 on the HP/IP support structure was not compliant with the engine manufacturers procedures.



- The evolution of the current advisory material relating to the minimisation of hazards resulting from uncontained engine rotor failures was based on service experience, including accident investigation findings. The damage to Airbus A380-842 VH-OQA exceeded the modelling used in the UERF safety analysis and, therefore, represents an opportunity to incorporate any lessons learned from this accident into the advisory material. [Safety issue]



- The calculation method in the aircraft manufacturers landing distance performance application was overly conservative and this could prevent the calculation of a valid landing distance at weights below the maximum landing weight with multiple system failures. [Safety issue]



Other Key Findings



- A large fragment of the hot intermediate pressure turbine disc passed through the left inner fuel tank, which resulted in a short-duration low-intensity fire. Conditions within the fuel tank were not sufficient to sustain combustion and a hazardous situation did not result.



- There was a short-duration oil fire in the No. 2 engine lower nacelle that self-extinguished, resulting only in localised damage to the nacelle.



- Despite significant system and structural damage following the uncontained engine rotor failure, the aircraft was capable of continued safe flight and landing.



- The duration of the CVR recording was insufficient to capture the entire occurrence that included the engine failure and subsequent ground operation up to passenger disembarkation.



- The crews decision to perform a precautionary disembarkation via the stairs likely provided the safest option, particularly given the low immediate safety threat and the elevated risks associated with an emergency evacuation into a potentially hazardous external environment.



- The flight and cabin crew managed the event as a competent team in accordance with standard operating procedures and practices.







The ATSB analysed:



The uncontained engine failure was the result of an internal engine fire in the high pressure/intermediate pressure (HP/IP) bearing support assembly that heated the intermediate pressure (IP) turbine drive arm until the material failed.



A fatigue crack had formed in the wall of the oil feed stub pipe over a period of time, and on the occurrence flight the crack reached a size that permitted the release of oil as an atomised spray into the buffer space between of the HP/IP bearing chamber. It was sufficiently hot within this chamber for the oil spray to auto-ignite.



The fire propagated through the bearing chamber buffer space, eventually impinging upon the IP turbine disc, resulting in the separation of the disc at the drive arm. The IP turbine disc moved rearwards and the engine surged. Within 4 seconds, the disc accelerated, and while the engine was running down from the surge, the HP system partially recovered, supplying additional energy to the IP turbine disc, allowing it to accelerate to a rotational speed in excess of its structural capacity.



The disc fractured into three main sections that had sufficient energy to penetrate the engine case and exit at high speed. Sections of the IP turbine disc and associated debris impacted and damaged the aircraft structures and systems.



The crack that formed in the oil feed stub pipe was a result of the normal operating movement of the HP/IP hub and the increased stresses in the pipe as a result of its reduced wall thickness. The reduced wall thickness was due to the counter bore for an oil filter being misaligned with the axis of the oil feed stub pipe during manufacture.



The ATSB continued stating that the (partial) high pressure system recovery, that added energy to the intermediate pressure (IP) turbine disc, had not been expected by the engine manufacturer. Previous experiences in other engine surges had shown that the system would not recover from the surge and the IP turbine would thus not reach a speed in excess of its design capabilities.



The ATSB continued: ""How the counter bore in the oil feed stub pipe came to be misaligned, released into service and remain in service undetected was a complex combination of events and missed opportunities that started with the design of the engine."" explaining the oil feed stub pipe became misaligned when ""between the time when the location of the timing pin was measured and the inner hub counter bore was formed, the inner hub moved relative to the milling machine. Because the interference bore, into which the oil feed stub pipe was later fitted, had previously been formed on the axis of the timing pin, the inner hub counter bore was not aligned with the axis of the interference bore, and hence the axis of the oil feed stub pipe.""



The manufacturer oil feed stub pipe subsequently went through a coordinate measuring machine. The machine was programmed to issue an error report if the position of the counter bore measured relative to the inner hub counter bore would be outside defined limits. Those records were not retained however, it is likely that the machine according to its programming did issue a non-conformance report for the oil feed stub pipes that later were assembled into VH-OQA's engine #2. The ATSB analysed: ""Even if an error was produced, there may have been a number of reasons to explain why it was not reported as a non-conformance. This could have included a problem with the print-out, simply missing it when reviewing the report or an erroneous second measurement that indicated that there was no error.""



The ATSB analysed that the non-conformance report (CMM) would indicate a non-conformance of the interference counter bore and made a reference to the design drawing, however would not state that it referenced the non-conformance to datum M (manufacturing datum derived from the inner hub counter bore) instead of datum AA (outer hub clearance hole, that became inaccessible with the oil stub feed pipe installed) as referenced in the drawing. The non-conformance report such created the impression that there was a possible lack of clearance between the pipe and the outer hub. Inspectors therefore likely used the wire gauge check and determined that there was sufficient clearance and the part was acceptable for use.

A major quality inspection at the engine manufacturer revealed that components were released to service despite a large number of non-conformances that had not been declared in the documentation. ""Post-accident determination of the oil feed stub pipe wall thickness from a number of the HP/IP hub assemblies produced prior to the Hucknall major quality investigation indicated that there were a significant number that did not conform to the design intent. It was therefore likely that HP/IP hub assemblies were released with undeclared non-conformances. Given that there were a number of inspectors involved over the 3-year period leading up to the major quality investigation, it was likely that a culture102 existed within the Hucknall facility that considered that not strictly adhering to the non-conformance management procedures in the group quality procedures was a viable form of behaviour. Specifically, it was considered acceptable to release parts with undeclared non-conformances that were considered by at least some of the inspectors to be minor.""



The ATSB thus concluded the analysis of how the hub became misaligned: ""Even though the errors identified by the CMM were an indication that there was a potentially thin wall on the oil feed stub pipe, the opportunity to detect this was missed because of the difference between the datum used in the CMM program and the one listed on the drawings."" and added: ""To ensure that an acceptable wall thickness was maintained, the designers applied a tight tolerance on the allowable deviation of the location of the interference bore and counter bore. However, when the manufacturing drawings were produced, those tolerances were increased - the location of the interference bore by a factor of 10 and the counter bore by a factor of two. Both further increased the potential size of any misalignment of the counter bore in the oil feed stub pipe. The ATSB was unable to determine why those tolerances had been increased.""



The ATSB analysed with respect to design and manufacturing drawings of the oil feed stub pipe, that although correct measurements of the first parts confirmed the conformance of the part with the manufacturing drawings, the parts did not conform to the design drawings and the intent of the designers. Those checks of the first parts thus did not ""close the loop"" between manufacturing methods and design intent. The ATSB believes that this missed opportunity mainly can be explained by ambiguous wording of the ""definition requirement"" to be used for the first article inspections, that referenced the manufacturing drawings as ""other documents"", that were not to be used for showing conformity, but did not clearly define the design drawings as reference until the manufacturing drawings were verified to attain the design intent.



The ATSB analysed that the damage to the aircraft as result of the uncontained engine failure was ""greater than the modelling outlined in the advisory material. Primarily, this was the result of combined damage from multiple fragments on different trajectories that affected redundant system paths. This included systems such as the flammable fluid shut-off valves (fuel low pressure shut-off valves for the No. 1 engine, and the hydraulic shut-off valve for the No. 2 engine) and the fire extinguishing system of the No. 1 engine. Notwithstanding this, the aircraft was capable of continued safe flight and it landed at Changi Airport, Singapore."" The certification of the aircraft with respect to minimize hazards associated with uncontained engine failures was based on lessons learned in past uncontained engine failures and results of investigations into such occurrences. The ATSB thus summarized: ""This accident represents an opportunity to extend the knowledge base relating to the hazards from UERF events and to incorporate that knowledge into the airframe certification advisory material in order to further minimise the effects of UERF on future aircraft designs.""



Based on passenger reports, who indicated seeing flames above the wing originating from holes in the wing and being visible for up to 10 minutes though decreasing over time, and photos as well as evidence (soot) left on the surface of the wings the ATSB determined that there had been a flash fire in the wing fuel tank. The ATSB analysed: ""The conditions within the tank were suitable for a flash fire; however, they were not suitable to sustain the fire.""



The ATSB analysed with respect to the landing distance performance calculations: ""The inherent conservatism in the landing distance calculation by the landing distance performance application, for aircraft weights below the maximum landing weight and multiple failures, had the potential to increase flightcrew workload. Further, if the calculation incorrectly showed that the aircraft was unable to land safely at the nearest airport, it had the potential to influence crews to delay landing to reduce weight or to divert to an alternate airport.""

The Australian Transportation Safety Bureau (ATSB) released their final report stating that ""although there was significant damage to the aircraft structure and systems, the aircraft was capable of continued safe flight and landing. Furthermore, the flight crew operated in accordance with standard operating procedures and practices. Therefore, this analysis is focused on the failure of the No. 2 engine and the factors that lead to the failure."" and concluding the probable causes of the uncontained engine failure were:The ATSB analysed:The ATSB continued stating that the (partial) high pressure system recovery, that added energy to the intermediate pressure (IP) turbine disc, had not been expected by the engine manufacturer.

Further analysis of the fracture surface on the misaligned oil pipe bore progressed and the ATSB developed a better understanding of the failure mechanism. These data as well as other evidence showed that the initial area of fatigue cracking (as identified in the images of the preliminary report) are not the area of interest but the adjacent area on the counter bore.



The ATSB said that due to lack of measurement records of the oil feed pipes Rolls Royce could not establish whether the oil feed pipes had been manufactured to specification. A subsequent risk assessment concluded that the standard oil feed pipes should be removed from service on all fleetwide engines.



Measurement records were also not available for two other oil feed pipe modules, on wing inspections of these modules found 7 modules with wall thicknesses less than required leading to the engines being replaced. 3 more engines were removed from service after evaluating their manufacturing measurement records.



The ATSB said: ""The ATSB, in conjunction with the UK AAIB and Rolls-Royce, is examining the circumstances and missed opportunities with the potential to have detected the reduced wall thickness and offset counter bore of the oil feed pipe prior to, during and after the manufacture of the module 51 assemblies. The ATSB is also reviewing the quality audits undertaken of, and the quality assurance system affecting, the module 51 design and manufacturing process and their effectiveness in detecting deficiencies in that process.""



Simulator tests based on the data derived from the flight data recorder aimed to assess the workload by the crew showed that the airplane remained in normal control law which kept the airplane within prescribed safety envelope.



The ATSB anticipates that the fact finding part of the investigation will conclude by July 2011, the analysis of the data and the compilation of the final report is anticipated to conclude by May 2012.



Revised area of interest on the counter-bore (Photo: ATSB):



The ATSB reported in an interim report that the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) held a meeting attended by Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA), Rolls Royce, ATSB, United Kingdom's AAIB and the BEA to discuss in the light of the significant damage resulting from this event, whether the engine as well as the airframe actually met design certification criteria. EASA and CASA agreed after receiving technical documentation from Airbus and Rolls Royce that the design certification criteria were met, however further investigation into the aircraft's structure and systems as well as the engine's behaviour is to be performed to establish, if there are safety issues needing to be addressed.Further analysis of the fracture surface on the misaligned oil pipe bore progressed and the ATSB developed a better understanding of the failure mechanism.

Of these 45 engines 3 engines failed the inspection and were removed from service for further examination. All Qantas engines currently flying were found with no defects and remain in service.



The European Aviation Safety Agency has approved software updates to the Rolls Royce engine electronic control units, that is now incorporated into all operating aircraft. The new software version predicts intermediate turbine overspeed events and shuts the engine down before a turbine disk failure occurs.





By Simon Hradecky, created Friday, Dec 3rd 2010 01:31Z, last updated Friday, Dec 3rd 2010 01:52Z Known debris trajectories (Graphics: ATSB) The Australian Transportation Safety Board ATSB have released their preliminary report reporting, that the flight crew consisted of 5 pilots: the captain (PIC), the first officer (FO), a second officer (SO), a second captain undergoing training as a check captain (CC) and a supervising check captain (SCC) overseeing the training of the second captain.



The flight was planned to fly to the east of active Merapi volcano. The PIC was pilot flying in the left hand seat, the FO was in the right hand seat, the CC in the center observer's seat, the SCC in the left hand observer's and the SO in the right hand observer's seat.



The crew reported later, that following departure from Singapore's runway 20C and after retracting gear and retracting the flaps they were climbing at 250 KIAS through 7000 feet when they heard two almost coincident loud bangs. The PIC selected altitude hold and heading hold immediately on the master control panel and the first officer started his stopwatch. The crew observed a slight yaw, the airplane levelled off. The crew expected the autothrottle to reduce engine thrust however it became evident autothrottle was no longer active and the engine thrust was reduced manually in order to maintain 250 KIAS. Both flight directors remained available to the crew. An engine #2 overheat warning was displayed on the ECAM soon followed by multiple messages.



The crew actioned the engine overheat checklist which required the engine to be throttled back to idle and monitor the situation for 30 seconds. During those 30 seconds a PAN call was transmitted. The FO noticed a fire indication for engine #2 for about 1-2 seconds before the display returned to overheat. The crew elected to shut the engine down, following the shut down the ECAM indicated the engine had failed.



The crew assessed that there was serious damage and elected to discharge a fire bottle into engine #2, but contrary to their expectations they did not get indication that the bottle had discharged. They discharged again but again received no confirmation that the bottle had discharged. They then decided to discharge the second bottle into engine #2 but again received no confirmation. The crew elected to continue the checklist and noticed that #2 was shown failed, engines #1 and #4 in degraded mode, #3 was operating in alternate mode. The ECAM continued to show numerous messages.



The flight crew recalled they received the following failures:



- engine #2 failed

- engine #1 and #4 in degraded mode

- green hydraulics low pressure and low quantity

- yellow hydraulics engine #4 pump error

- failure of AC electrical busses 1 and 2

- flight controls in alternate mode

- wing slats inoperative

- ailerons partial control only

- reduced spoiler control

- landing gear control and indicator warnings

- multiple brake system messages

- engine anti-ice and air data sensor messages

- multiple fuel system messages including fuel jettison fault

- center of gravity messages

- autothrust and autoland inoperative

- #1 engine generator disconnected

- left wing pneumatic bleed leaks

- avionic system overheat



The crew discussed whether to immediately return to Singapore, climbing or holding and decided the best option was to maintain altitude while processing the ECAM messages.



The crew frequently assessed the fuel on board which was sufficient to complete the checklist procedures. The aircraft remained controllable. They advised ATC they would need about 30 minutes to process the ECAM messages and requested to hold for that period. Singapore cleared the flight for a holding east of Singapore, the flight crew advised however they needed to remain within 30nm of Singapore Airport in case they needed to land immediately. ATC advised that residents at Batam had found debris on the ground, then vectored the aircraft to a 20nm holding pattern east of Singapore Airport.



While the crew processed the ECAM messages the SO was dispatched to the cabin to assess the damage to the #2 engine. While he walked through the cabin a passenger, also Qantas pilot, pointed out that pictures from the vertical fin mounted camera suggested a fluid leak from the left hand wing. The SO walked down to the lower deck of the passenger cabin and observed damage to the wing and a fluid leak that appeared to be about 0.5 meters wide. He could not see the turbine area of the engine from any position in the cabin. The SO returned to the cockpit and reported his observations.



The crew stopped re-arranging the fuel system doubting the integrity of the system. They could not dump fuel due to the fuel jettison error message. The operator sent ACARS messages that they had received multiple ACARS messages indicating various system failures from the automatic reporting system, the crew was busy with the ECAM messages and found time to just acknowledge the ACARS transmissions.



The PIC and SSC made a number of announcements to the passengers advising that they had technical problems, they were working to address these issues and it would take some time to do so. Subsequently the SO and SSC went to the cabin frequently to check the left hand side of the aircraft and to provide feedback to cabin crew and passengers.



It took about 50 minutes to complete the checklist procedures associated with the ECAM messages. During that time the autopilot was engaged. The crew then assessed which systems were operative, degraded and failed and discussed the impact on landing performance. They also believed that engine #1 may have been damaged and discussed a number of concerns regarding fuel imbalances that had been indicated by the ECAM.



The crew determined their landing weight would be 440 tons, about 50 tons above maximum landing weight, and computed the required landing distance with the systems available. The computation showed, that a landing on runway 20C was feasable with 100 meters of runway remaining. The crew elected to proceed on basis of this computation and advised ATC accordingly. The crew advised further they needed emergency services at the upwind end of the runway, fluid was leaking from the left wing that was likely to include hydraulic fluid and fuel.



Prior to leaving the holding pattern the crew discussed controllability of the aircraft and performed a number of manual checks at the holding speed. The crew requested a 20nm final to runway 20C to commence from 4000 feet, ATC fulfilled that request.



While the crew began the approach and lowered flaps they conducted further controllability tests at the approach speed and decided the airplane was controllable. The landing gear was lowered using the emergency extension procedure, a further controllability check was conducted.



The approach speed was computed at 166 KIAS. The crew was aware that reverse thrust was available only from the #3 engine, no leading edge slats were available, there was limited aileron and spoiler control, anti-skid was restricted to the body gear only, there was limited nose wheel steering and the nose would likely pitch up on landing. An ECAM message indicated they could not apply maximum braking until the nose wheel was on the runway. The flaps were extended to position 3.



ATC vectored the aircraft for a 20nm final progressively descending the aircraft to 4000 feet, the PIC was aware that speed control was necessary to avoid an aerodynamic stall and a runway overrun. Consequently the PIC set engine #1 and #4 to symmetric thrust and controlled the speed of the aircraft with the #3 engine. The autopilot disconnected a number of times during the initial approach, the airspeed dropped to 165 KIAS. The PIC reconnected the autopilot a number of times but when the autopilot disengaged again at 1000 feet he decided to fly manually for the remainder of the flight. Due to the limited runway margin available the CC reminded the PIC that the landing had to be done without flare and there would be a slightly higher nose up attitude during touch down.



The flight crew briefed the cabin crew for a possible runway overrun and evacuation.



The airplane touched down on Singapore's runway 20C 109 minutes after departure and within 6 seconds the nose wheel touched down and maximum braking was applied, reverse thrust was selected on the #3 engine. The crew felt that initially the deceleration was slow but with maximum braking and reverse thrust the airplane began to decelerate. The PIC felt confident the airplane would stop on the runway after the airplane had decelerated to 60 knots, and moved engine #3 gradually out of maximum reverse thrust. Manual braking was continued and the airplane stopped about 150 meters before the runway end.



The crew then shut down the remaining 3 engines, the aircraft electrical systems went into a configuration similiar to an emergency electrical power mode which blanked most of the cockpit displays. Just prior to the displays going blank the crew observed the body gear temperature rising to 900 degrees C and above. After some confusion which of the VHF radios remained available the FO contacted fire services who requested engine #1 to be shut down. The crew replied engine #1 was already shut down but was advised that the engine continued to run. The crew recycled the engine #1 master switch, but the engine continued to run. The crew used the emergency shut off switch and fire extinguisher bottles, but the engine continued to run. The fire commander advised there was fuel leaking from the left hand wing, the FO advised of the hot brakes and requested fire retardant foam to be applied over that fuel. The fire commander complied with that request.



After assessing the checklists the crew decided the safest course of action would be to disembark the passengers through the right hand doors via stairs. A single door was elected so that the passengers could be counted and the other doors remained available should a rapid evacuation via slides become necessary.



Crew contacted the operator via mobile phone to check how to shut engine #1 down.



The first passenger disembarked through the #2 main deck forward door 55 minutes after landing, the last passenger disembarked about 1 hour later.



The crew was advised by the fire commander that 4 tyres of the left body gear had deflated. Further attempts to shut engine #1 down were without success, operator advice to activate a number of circuit breakers in the electronic bay also remained unsuccessful. Attempts were made to re-arrange the fuel supply in order to starve engine #1, however due to lack of electrical power that was not possible.



Finally the decision was made to drown the engine with fire fighting foam. The engine finally stopped about 127 minutes after landing.



No injuries occurred on board of the aircraft. Two persons received minor injuries on the ground at the Island of Batam.



The PIC had a total experience of 15104 hours thereof 570 on the A380, the FO had 11279 hours thereof 1271 hours on the A380, the SO had 8153 hours thereof 1005 on type, the CC had 20144 hours thereof 806 on the A380 and the SCC had 17692 hours thereof 1345 hour on type.



Engine #2 had ejected a number of engine components. The known trajectories of some of the liberated engine segments were towards the lower fuselage and upwards through the wing. Sections of the intermediate pressure (IP) turbine disk penetrated the leading edge of the left hand wing, the front wing spar and the upper surface of the wing. A small section of the turbine disk penetrated the left wing to fuselage fairing resulting in damage to numerous system components, the fuselage structure and elements of the aircraft wiring. Released debris also penetrated the left wings lower surface resulting in a fuel leak from the engine #2 fuel feed tank and the left wing inner fuel tank. Other impact damage was observed on the #2 engine pylon, the left fuselage keel beam support splice and the left wing false spar. Small impact damage was also observed on the left hand side of the fuselage.



The recovered part of the turbine disk represents one third of the disk weighing almost 70kg. The disk showed two radial fractures and a circumferential fracture in the region adjacent to the drive arm. In a visual inspection the fractures appeared consistent with a ductile overstress failure mechanism, there was no evidence of pre-existing defects.



The flight data recorder was downloaded and contained 77 hours and the last 5 flights of the aircraft. Valuable information was retrieved from the data regarding the engine failure.



The cockpit voice recorder (2 hours duration) had been overwritten to the engine #1 continuing to run after landing.



The flight data recorder shows, that engine #2's oil temperature and pressure values began to deviate from the other engine values 3:35 minutes after the aircraft became airborne. 37 seconds later the engine #2 N3 vibrations increase, the N3 indications fluctuate, 1 second later the N1 and N2 indications begin to decrease, N3 increases. 8 seconds after the vibrations began to increase N3 reaches 98% and started to reduce, engine #2 fuel flow reduces, N1 and N2 rpms decrease rapidly, a second later the overheat warning activates, another second later master warning and master caution illuminate, 2 seconds later (12 seconds after the vibrations increased) the turbine disk liberates at an altitude of 7250 feet evident by the failure of multiple systems at that point, the ATSB annotates that their list of system failures is still incomplete (Flight controls - Left mid-aileron, spoiler #4, slats, Hydraulics - green, Anti-skid, Electrical power  AC_2, Bleed Air- pylon and wing overheat).



The ATSB released a safety recommendation to Rolls Royce demanding RR should address a safety issue with the manufacturing process of stub pipes, that were identified with an axial misalignment of an area of counter-boring within the inner diameter of the stub pipe leading to a localized thinning of the pipe wall on one side. The ATSB reported, that fatigue cracking had been discovered within a stub pipe (see picture below) feeding oil into the HP/IP (high pressue/intermediate pressure) bearing structure. While investigation of the engine failure is continuing it has been identified that the leakage of oil into the HP/IP bearing structure buffer space and a subsequent oil fire within that area was central to the engine failure and liberation of the IP turbine disk. The area of fatigue cracking was associated with the area of pipe wall thinning.

""Damage is a single large penetration of both the droop nose No2 [leading edge section] and the wing topskin fixed topskin panels and D nose structure, which were simultaneously damaged after debris travelled through the lower bottom skin and exited at this point on the topskin. Damage to the internal structure at this location includes the drive rib 4 which is part of the leading edge structure (both inboard and outboard locations). Damage to the droop nose at this location cannot be clearly defined as yet.

""The drive motor for the droop nose located between the inboard and outboard rib 4 of the leading edge has been badly damaged upon impact and seems to have been on the direct path of the trajectory through the wing.

""Further details of the internal damages will only be revealed after the removal of the droop nose and further access to the leading edge can be gained.""

Airbus also recorded engine shrapnel impact damage to flap track fairings, the lower wing/fuselage fairing, and to the fuselage side in line with the damaged engine at about the level of the upper deck floor.

Yesterday’s drama, which saw the ultramodern jet making an emergency landing in Singapore with 466 on board and smoke trailing from a broken jet engine, could hardly have come at a worse time for the French-based firm.

Airbus and its parent company EADS had hoped the expected announcement of a major Chinese contract during President Hu Jintao’s visit to Paris would put an end to a streak of bad publicity surrounding its planes.

Instead, early A380 customer Qantas has grounded its fleet of the company’s massive flagship, and air crash investigators are examining how some kind of explosion had knocked out the engine and severed part of its outer housing.

French flag-carrier Air France has not grounded its A380s, noting that its planes use jet engines made by Engine Alliance – a consortium of Pratt and Wittney, General Electric and Safran.

Qantas, on the other hand, uses engines from Britain’s Rolls Royce, and these are expected to come under scrutiny, along with the plane itself, which has only been in service three years and has never had a major accident.

Aviation officials have urged calm, insisting that a four-engined jet can lose one of its four jets and still land within normal emergency procedures.

But while the investigation continues, markets are nervous. In Paris, EADS shares fell 3.99 per cent in a rising market. In London, Rolls Royce stock plunged by even more, losing 4.3 per cent on the news.

“For pilots, an engine cutting out is not an exceptional event, even if it doesn’t happen every morning,” said Air France captain Eric Bernard. “What’s new here is that it has happened to an A380 for the first time.”

Mr Bernard said that an experienced pilot should be able to land a plane with one engine out without drama, as appears to be the case with the Qantas crew, who turned back six minutes out of Singapore and landed without incident.

Nevertheless, industry analysts said Airbus had suffered a blow.

“It’s clearly an image problem, with Qantas’ fleet stuck on the deck,” said one expert, speaking on condition of anonymity so as no to ruffle feathers in France’s close-knit aviation industry.

“The punishment is immediate, because the markets know that this implies extra costs to get these planes into service,” he said, referring to Airbus’ slow delivery of the flagship A380, marked by a series of technical delays.

He nevertheless said he thought the brutal drop in EADS share price “exaggerated”, given that the problem may turn out to be Rolls Royce’s.

He and another expert pointed to Air France and Emirates’ decision to keep flying on their Engine Alliance engines as a sign that the industry is leaning towards the suspicion that the motors and not the airframe are at fault.

Investigations are continuing into other recent Airbus incidents, including the loss last July of an Air France A330, which plunged into the Atlantic en route between Rio and Paris with the loss of all 226 people on board. No firm cause for that crash has been established, but since the accident Airbus has ordered all customers to replace the model of air speed probe fitted on the lost jet with a newer generation model less prone to icing up.

Mr Hu began his visit to Paris yesterday, and EADS hopes to conclude deals for $7 billion worth of Airbus airliners. China Southern Airlines has already indicated it might buy 26 of them for $3.78 million.

For its part, Airbus was insisting yesterday that the Singapore incident is a matter for Rolls Royce and promising the A380 delivery schedule – including one for Qantas by the end of the year – would remain unchanged."

Rolls-Royce’s move could be another blow to a much-delayed A380 programme as Airbus was scheduled to deliver over a dozen Rolls-Royce-powered A380s — primarily to Singapore Airlines, Qantas and Lufthansa by the end of next year.

But both Singapore Airlines and Qantas, with a combined 22 A380s still to be delivered, said on Tuesday they had not been informed of any delivery delays. Qantas said it expected none.

“I can confirm that Rolls-Royce is arranging to supply some new engines from the production line to replace some engines removed from the serviced aircraft,” an Airbus spokesperson said, without saying which airlines would receive those engines.

The Airbus A380 — the world’s largest passenger aircraft with a list price of about $350-million — has been hit by safety concerns after a Rolls-Royce engine partly disintegrated mid-flight, forcing a fully laden Qantas plane to make an emergency landing on November 4.

Airlines using the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines have been ordered by European aviation authorities to undertake major tests, which analysts said were so strenuous they would likely disrupt schedules.

“Until this problem is fully resolved I think the situation with the delivery of A380 to customers … will be in jeopardy,” Standard & Poor’s analyst Sukhor Yusof said.

Airbus said last week that the problem with Rolls-Royce engine could have an impact on its delivery target for 2011.

The price to pay

Airbus is in the process of arranging for engines to be taken off the A380 production line in Toulouse in France and shipped to Sydney to be fitted to the grounded Qantas aircraft, according to a report in the Aviation Business, which cited Airbus chief operating officer John Leahy in Sydney last week.

Qantas’ fleet of six A380 aircraft have remained grounded since the incident earlier this month.

“The cost is roughly $1-million for Qantas for each day the A380 is grounded. But the biggest issue is reputational. It’s down to the consumer and there’s a price to pay there as well,” an Australian analyst, who declined to be identified, said.

However, the problem would not lead to cancellation of orders as it was the problem with the engine instead of the airframe, he added.

Qantas — set to take five A380s by the end of next year, including three within the next few months — said it had not been notified of any delivery delays and expected deliveries to remain on schedule.

Singapore Airlines spokesperson Nicholas Ionides said the carrier had not been informed by Airbus of any delay on its A380 delivery schedule.

The world’s second-biggest carrier by market capitalisation currently operates 11 A380s and is scheduled to receive eight more before end-March 2012.

Rolls-Royce shares are down nearly 9% since the incident. Qantas shares have lost about 5% since then, while Singapore Airlines shares have been flat. – Reuters"

“We have plans to buy more planes,” Zhang Jianzhong told Reuters on the sidelines of an airshow in China, but said the airline had no interest in the A380 superjumbo.

On whether Boeing Co would delay delivery of the 787 Dreamliners the airline had ordered, Zhang said: “It has already been delayed.”

Boeing grounded its aircraft testing fleet and has made no decision on when it will resume test flights after one of the light-weight, carbon-composite aircraft was damaged by an electrical fire last week."

Airbus makes dramatic emergency landing - Times of Malta,"Fri, 05 Nov 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZm1hbHRhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy92aWV3L2FpcmJ1cy1tYWtlcy1kcmFtYXRpYy1lbWVyZ2VuY3ktbGFuZGluZy4zMzQ3NTLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A Qantas A380 with more than 450 people on board made a dramatic forced landing in Singapore yesterday, trailing smoke from a blackened engine after the Airbus superjumbo’s first mid-air emergency.

Australia’s Qantas Airways, which has never suffered a fatal jet crash in its 90-year history, said it was grounding all six of its A380s following the incident.

Qantas said flight QF32 developed major engine trouble just six minutes into a flight from Singapore to Sydney, and it dumped fuel over Indonesia before returning to Singapore’s Changi Airport.

There were no injuries to the 433 passengers or the 26 crew, officials said.

Metal debris slammed into areas of the Indonesian city of Batam, on an island just south of Singapore.

Yanes Tri, 55, said a “large piece of metal” punched a hole in her house. “I was shocked but I’m grateful I wasn’t standing next to the wall,” she said.

Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said the plane had experienced “a significant engine failure” to one of its four Rolls-Royce Trent 900 jets. The British engine maker pledged to work with Qantas to identify the problem.

“We will suspend those A380 services until we are completely confident that Qantas safety requirements have been met,” Mr Joyce told reporters in Sydney.

The four other airlines that fly the world’s largest passenger plane – Singapore Airlines, Air France, Emirates and Lufthansa – all said they had no plans to ground their own fleets.

But Airbus and Rolls-Royce later advised Singapore Airlines, which uses the same engine model as Qantas in its A380s, to conduct technical checks on its aircraft.

Airbus, which is betting its future on the commercial viability of the double-decker plane, said the Qantas incident had been “significant” but stressed the A380 was safe to fly on three engines.

“We are not playing down the incident, but it is covered in the certification procedures,” a spokesman for the French-based company said, as France’s air accident investigation agency launched a probe.

After disembarking, relieved passengers recounted the incident to reporters.

German passenger Ulf Wasch­busch said there was a loud boom and flames on the plane’s left wing soon after take-off.

“Something ruptured the left wing,” Mr Waschbusch, a technology executive based in Singapore, said.

“Everyone was surprisingly calm on the plane. We are not going crazy at all,” he said. “The crew helped tremendously. I felt in good hands. Qantas did a great job in keeping us safe.”

Six fire engines swarmed the jet on landing, spraying liquid on it, according to an AFP reporter at the Singapore airport.

One of the engines on the plane’s left wing was blackened and its rear cowling was missing.

Passengers began emerging in the arrival hall about five hours after landing, but were whisked away by security officers as a throng of journalists shouted questions."
BBC - Factfile: Rolls-Royce Trent engines - CBBC Newsround,"Thu, 04 Nov 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHA6Ly9uZXdzLmJiYy5jby51ay9sb2NhbC9kZXJieS9oaS9wZW9wbGVfYW5kX3BsYWNlcy9oaXN0b3J5L25ld3NpZF85MTYwMDAwLzkxNjAwMjcuc3Rt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Trent 900 powers the Airbus A380 'superjumbo'

The Rolls-Royce family of Trent engines power more than half of the world's modern wide-bodied aircraft. Dating back to 1995, the first version of the Trent was the 700 series, chosen to power Cathay Pacific's fleet of A330 aircraft and opening the door for the Derby-based company's new family of commercial airline power plants. Trent engines have their roots in the RB211, originally designed to power the Lockheed TriStar in the 1970s. The Trent 900 is one of the latest incarnations of the engine to enter service and was developed by Rolls-Royce for the Airbus A380. Other engines in the Trent family include the 500 (for the Airbus A340) and the 800, built for the Boeing 777 which entered service in 1996. Twelve years later a British Airways Boeing 777 flying from Beijing to London, crash-landed at Heathrow after both of its Trent 800 engines lost power during final approach. The investigation found the cause was ice being released from the fuel system leading to a restriction in the flow of fuel to the engines. The Trent 900 first flew on a test aircraft in 1994 Modifications to the engine's heat exchanger were ordered and later extended to the 500 and 700 series engines after a similar loss of power in one engine of an Airbus A330. Production delay The development of the Trent 900 was not without its problems. Rolls-Royce announced it would develop the engine in 1996 and it made its maiden flight on a test aircraft in 2004. However, delays in the development of the Airbus A380 meant that, in 2006, production of the Trent 900 was suspended for around 12 months. When production recommenced in 2007 Rolls-Royce aimed to deliver 100 of the engines each year. The engine maker's safety record is generally excellent. However, the incident with engine number two of a Qantas Airbus A380 in November 2010 is not the first sustained by the Australian carrier. This is the second failure Qantas has sustained with Rolls-Royce engines in three months. On 1 September the airline said a Boeing 747 bound for Sydney returned to San Francisco after an engine failed and was shut off soon after take-off. The explosion on that occasion was in an RB211 and blew a hole in the engine's outer casing. In August 2010 a Trent 1000 engine blew up on Rolls-Royce's Derby test bed. The failure of the engine, built to power the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, resulted in the engine being destroyed and damage to the test bed facility.
