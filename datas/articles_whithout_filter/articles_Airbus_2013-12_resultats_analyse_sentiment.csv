Flying Onboard the A321 – Does it Make a Good 757 Replacement? - Airline Reporter,"Tue, 10 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMy8xMi9mbHlpbmctb25ib2FyZC10aGUtYTMyMS1pcy1pdC1hLTc1Ny1yZXBsYWNlbWVudC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With most Boeing 757s heading toward the end of their life cycles, airlines are moving forward with plans for more fuel-efficient aircraft that can hold similar amounts of passengers over a decent range. The most popular option at the moment is the Airbus A321. Having never flown one myself, I was excited to have an opportunity to test out this aircraft on a recent flight out east. I wanted to see first hand how the newer A321 stacked up to the (soon-to-be) classic 757.

At the moment, the only current operatosr of the A321 in the U.S. are Spirit and US Airways; however JetBlue and American Airlines have received their first ones and Delta, and Hawaiian have plans to expand their fleet with the A321 in either CEO (Current Engine Option) or NEO (New Engine Option) flavor. In some cases, these aircraft will replace 757s, such as with AA; however, some are just for expansion as with the case of JetBlue & Hawaiian.

My first-ever flight on an Airbus A321 was with US Airways, travelling from Phoenix to Washington DC’s Reagan National Airport. Not only would this be a new aircraft for me, but also a new airport (Phoenix) and a new airline (US Airways). Hee-haw, I was down for the AvGeek newness tri-fecta.

Unfortunately my flight didn’t start off all that well thanks to my delayed flight in to PHX, but I made it onboard (and so did my bag). I boarded the aircraft through door 1L and headed towards my seat in economy.

One of the first big A321/B757 differences that I noticed was in boarding process. The A321 boarded through door 1L while the 757 often uses 2L. Seeing such a large aircraft boarding through the premium cabin is always a bit of a fun experience. Having flown both 757-200s and 300s this year, the A321 felt roughly the same inside as the 757-200; you could easily mistake the same (long) aircraft as the narrow-body configuration feels the same.

Looking out the window is the dead giveaway as to what you’re flying, as the majority of A321s you are going to see are, at the moment, fitted with Airbus’ iconic wingtip ’œfences’ (though new aircraft should come fitted with sharklets). 757s come either with a retrofitted blended winglet, or none at all. The difference in looks from the outside is also in the nose.

The A321 uses the same family nose as the A320, A319, & A318 and stands out as a little bit boring compared to the 757, in my opinion. It just looks like someone took an A320 and pulled on either end to stretch it out. The 757 has that wonderfully sunken flight desk from the rest of the aircraft look that I love. Cosmetic differences really don’t matter that much – it should be about the inflight experience, right? Well, maybe to some.

Onboard, the aircraft it feels like any other A320-family aircraft. The same overhead panels, bins, lights, and vents. Slick, clean, and modern, my A321 was only delivered in 2011, and it paled in comparison to the age of some of the 757s out there, which may be as old as I am.

While the first A321 was delivered to Lufthansa in 1994, the bulk of them have been delivered after the 757 went out of production in 2005. Each carrier is going to be different on the passenger experience, but on average, flying on a relatively modern A321 is going to be better than an older aircraft.

There was no ground-breaking technology or many entertainment options on my US Airways’ flight. My flight did offer GoGo Internet and I took advantage of it during my four-hour flight. I couldn’t complain one bit about the service onboard either as there was multiple rounds of drinks (especially good for a coffee nut like me).

I had come into this flight thinking to myself that it would be some mind-blowing new experience and that I could easily say that the A321 would be a fantastic replacement to the 757’¦ but I can’t say that. Even a side-by-side comparison doesn’t help all that much either:

Aircraft 757-200 A321-200 Range 3900nm 3000nm Range with Winglets 4100nm 3200nm Maximum Take Off Weight 255,000lb 206,000lb Wingspan 124ft 10in 111ft 11in Aircraft Length 155ft 146ft Cabin Length 118.4ft 113ft Cabin Width 11.6ft 12ft 1in

The information that has been touted suggests a range increase of only 500nm, still a good 400nm short of the 757. Clearly not going to cut the mustard on range, but does it really matter? The A321 has plenty of legs to make (like LAX/SFO – JFK), that many 757’s currently fly on. What the A321 can’t replace is the low-demand transatlantic routes that the 757 is utilized for by carriers like United and Delta. So what is the real replacement, if there even is one?

In a future piece, we’ll focus on Boeing’s own offering, the 737-900ER and its replacement, the 737 MAX 9. With a slightly longer range than the A321, United has chosen to utilize the Boeing plane to replace their 757-200s.

In the end, the A321 is a great domestic replacement option for the long-in-the-tooth 757. Carriers like US Airways and American are obviously happy with the economics and capabilities of the plane, but how each airline configures their replacement planes will likely be more important than the plane they choose for most passengers.

Airbus developing new interior for A320 - Runway Girl Network,"Thu, 19 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTMvMTIvYWlyYnVzLWRldmVsb3BpbmctbmV3LWludGVyaW9yLWZvci1hMzIwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is working to develop a new interior for its A320 family, in a move that will better position the single-aisle airliners to compete – from a cabin perspective – with the 737, which boasts the highly popular Boeing Sky Interior.

While the new A320 interior is not formally part of Airbus’ offering yet, RGN Premium has learned it features a new overhead pivot bin solution that will offer more room for passengers’ bags, while taking advantage of the A320’s wider cross section to provide better spaciousness overall in the cabin without adding weight.

The design will starkly contrast to the A320’s current, dated interior, with its angular fixed overhead bins and segmented ceiling panels. Airbus declines to comment on where development now stands, with a spokesman saying, “Nothing has been launched and there is no timeline. I can only say what we’re doing or not doing.”

He adds, “Airbus is hard at work on lots and lots of things all the time but that is just part of business as usual. We’re always looking at things. We know what pivoting bins are. We have them on the A380 and have fixed bins on the A380, and one doesn’t replace the other; it depends on what the market needs and wants.”

C&D Zodiac had hoped that its new ISIS interior for the A320 – with its pivoting ‘SmartBin’, backlit PSU pod and full LED lighting – would spark Airbus’ interest in adopting ISIS for the A320. The company has showcased ISIS at the Aircraft Interiors Expo for two years running, and made clear it sees ISIS as a good option for Airbus to roll out a new interior when it launches the A320neo, the re-engined successor of the A320. It recently snagged a US-based launch customer for ISIS in the retrofit market.

Whether the new Airbus pivot bin will debut on the A320neo remains to be seen. During my conversation with the airframer, it repeatedly stressed that it hasn’t officially launched any new interior program. Also unclear is whether Airbus is working with Zodiac on a modified design or with another of its suppliers, though RGN Premium understands that Airbus’ solution will be integrated in a different way than ISIS and represents a different technical solution.

Airlines and industry observers believe the time is ripe for Airbus to upgrade the A320 interior. The Boeing Sky Interior (BSI) has been hugely popular with airlines and passengers alike. In addition to offering bins that pivot up and out of the way, sculpted sidewalls and other features, the Boeing Sky Interior uses LED lighting in the cabin to give the appearance of a soft blue sky overhead.

An Airbus operator says it sees Airbus’ new interior concept as a significant improvement to the onboard experience because it opens up the cabin. An interiors firm that has also studied the design notes that, when launched, it “will help move the market” forward for A320 retrofits, which is good for business.

The A320 interior was last refreshed around 2007, notes long-time industry consultant Scott Hamilton. “The Boeing Sky Interior is a 21st Century look, as opposed to a 20th Century look. The A320 interior is very functional, but, by contrast to BSI it looks dated, and with the development of the A320neo family, Airbus – I personally believe – has to go ahead and refresh the interior as well. Bombardier has a more modern looking interior for the CSeries. So Airbus had to refresh the interior.

“So you have Zodiac doing that for retrofits, BSI, the CSeries – Airbus has to do something, and with the pending introduction of the A350 into service, why wouldn’t you want your most popular airplane by sales count to have a similar look to what is now your new flagship airplane?”

Scott further notes, “By October 2015, when EIS [entry-into-service] is planned for A320neo, the current cabin interior would be eight years old, and it would be up against the Boeing Sky Interior.”

At the end of last year, Airbus said it would offer A320 family customers the option of a new LED lighting solution with a full spectrum of colors within about a year. The airframer has also been busy with other interiors innovations. Its Space-Flex product, developed in partnership with Diehl, replaces an A320’s full-width rear galley with a smaller unit along with two lavatories that previously were located left and right of the central aisle. The design enables operators to add three seats while providing an accessibility option for persons with reduced mobility (PRM), as the two lavs can be converted into a single enclosure for wheelchairs. TAM Airlines is the launch customer for Space-Flex.

Airbus’ new optimized Smart-Lav lavatory is part of Space-Flex for the A320, but is something the airframer can offer as a standalone product on this and other platforms. This flexibility is important. B/E Aerospace’s modular lavatory for the 737NG debuted on a Delta Air Lines 737-900ER in September, and shows every sign of being a runaway success. Indeed, the lavatory and B/E’s exclusive contract with Boeing to produce it for the 737 has elicited much interest from the investment community (and B/E’s stock price certainly hasn’t suffered in recent months).

Asked if Boeing intends to offer modular lavatories on other aircraft types, including lavs to accommodate PRMs, a spokesman for the US airframer said, “Boeing can accommodate customer requests for specific lavatory layouts on Boeing widebody airplanes, including lavatories providing more space for reduced mobility passengers.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.996277391910553}",neutral,0.996277391910553,0

During the past several months, state officials have traveled to the U.S. headquarters of Airbus SAS in Virginia, moved to connect Airbus with Washington state suppliers, and signed a five-year confidentiality agreement with the company to allow further exploration of business opportunities, according to records obtained by The Associated Press under public disclosure laws.

In a confidential memo provided to Gov. Jay Inslee in July, state officials described dozens of potential ways to expand or recruit aerospace businesses in the state. At the top of the memo was Airbus, described as just one of a few major opportunities.

One expert said for years it was generally frowned upon for Washington state officials to jeopardize the relationship with Boeing by seeking ties with Airbus. However, the steps outlined in the memo came amid tension created when Boeing moved its headquarters from Seattle to Chicago and started an assembly line in South Carolina to build its 787 passenger plane.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999477863311768}",neutral,0.9999477863311768,0
"Airbus parent EADS to cut 5,800 jobs - USA TODAY","Mon, 09 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEzLzEyLzA5L2VhZHMtam9iLWN1dHMvMzkxOTIxMS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus parent EADS to cut 5,800 jobs

PARIS — European air and defense company EADS, parent company of Airbus, said Monday it is cutting 5,800 jobs over the next two years as part of a major overhaul to reduce costs and refocus on civil aviation.

The company said in a statement that the jobs would be eliminated from its corporate and space and defense divisions by the end of 2016. The many space and defense divisions will be combined into one arm, to be called Airbus DS.

EADS, which is changing its overall name to Airbus, is also getting rid of its corporate headquarters, just outside Paris, and moving staff to another site, also outside Paris.

The company had once sought to become less dependent on its civil aircraft business with a goal of increasing its defense business, maker of the A400M European freighter, to around half of total revenue. A major part of that plan was a proposed merger with British defense company BAE Systems. The merger would have created a company with a market value just shy of Airbus rival Boeing's and one with a more equal balance of civil aviation and defense. Currently, the civil aircraft business makes up almost 70% of EADS' group sales.

Objections from the French, German and British government scuttled the merger, and the global economic downturn, which forced governments to drastically cut military spending, has made the defense business a much more difficult one.

Meanwhile, as the emerging world takes to the skies, the civil aircraft business is thriving. Boeing, for instance, forecasts that over the next 20 years the global demand for new airplanes will exceed 35,000 aircraft, valued at $4.8 trillion.

EADS' net earnings rose 45% in the third quarter, to 436 million euros.

But CEO Tom Enders said Monday that the cuts were necessary if the company is going to compete and attract defense and space customers in growing markets outside Europe, which is not doing as well.

""We need to cut costs, eliminate product and resource overlaps, create synergies in our operations and product portfolio and better focus our Research and Development efforts,"" he said.

EADS said it would offer up to 1,500 of those laid off positions at Airbus or Eurocopter. Another 1,300 positions will be eliminated by non-renewal of temporary contracts. After offering voluntary plans to employees, EADS expects to have to make 1,000 to 1,450 outright layoffs.

The company, which has most of its operations in France, Germany, Spain and Britain, did not specify where the cuts would be made.

Unions in France had warned the restructuring would entail layoffs and called on the French government to intervene, saying that the weakening of EADS would have consequences for the entire French economy. French industry has been hit especially hard by the crisis, but was in decline even before the global recession hit. The loss of manufacturing jobs is one reason its unemployment rate is so high, currently at 10.9%.

""The aeronautical, space and defense sector is a major asset for national industry, and we will not accept that it is weakened for reasons of short-term profitability,"" unions that represent EADS workers wrote in a letter to the prime minister last month.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9966325163841248}",neutral,0.9966325163841248,0

While the production line is a memory, there’s one thing that can’t be forgotten: promises the aerospace giant made to many buyers that the jets would hold their value or it would make up the difference. Now, after watching prices of used A340s slide for years, Airbus is scrambling to persuade customers they didn’t buy a white elephant.

At a Dec. 4 meeting in London for airline and aircraft-leasing company representatives, the European planemaker floated a plan to boost the seat count of existing A340s by 8 percent and lower maintenance expenses to improve the plane’s economics—and raise its resale value. Demand for the A340, introduced in 1993, dried up as oil prices soared and aircraft makers introduced more energy-efficient two-engine models capable of flying transoceanic routes that once required four engines. Richard Branson’s Virgin Atlantic Airways, after launching the most recent version of the A340 in 2002 at a splashy London ceremony with supermodel Claudia Schiffer, quietly retired the plane last year.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.97100430727005}",neutral,0.97100430727005,0
"Airbus, engine OEMs make the case for A340 future - Leeham News and Analysis","Sun, 08 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMy8xMi8wOC9haXJidXMtZW5naW5lLW9lbXMtbWFrZS10aGUtY2FzZS1mb3ItYTM0MC1mdXR1cmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus held a summit December 4 for stakeholders in the A340 to explain how there continues to be life after production ended and despite being a four-engined airplane in a two-engine world.

Key to the future of this out-of-production airliner is increasing the capacity of the A340-600 to an exit-limited 475 seats and for Rolls-Royce to alter its Total Care engine maintenance Power-by-the-Hour terms and conditions to reduce costs.

Airlines, financiers, appraisers and the engine makers were invited by John Leahy, chief operating officer-Customers of Airbus. Engine providers CFM International, Rolls-Royce, Lufthansa Airlines and Hi Fly, a small European airline, made presentations in addition to Airbus.

Airbus produced 246 A340-200/300s and 131 A340-500/600s; 227 and 131 respectively are in operation or parked.

Status A340-200 A340-300 A340-500 A340-600 In Service 19 175 20 90 Stored 6 27 14 7

Airbus guaranteed the residual value on an unknown number, and has strong motivation to see these airplanes continue in service, according to one person familiar with the situation.

Bernstein Research wrote in a recent note, A340s remain under pressure, with high fuel prices making these airplanes uneconomical in most applications. We expect that Airbus exposure to A340-500/600s could exceed €1 billion on AVGs exercisable at 10-12 years. EADS has taken provisions for these (extent unclear) and will likely work with airlines to find other financial arrangements than simply to pay out cash on the AVGs.

The perception in some corners is that there is no value or role to play, a second person familiar with the situation tells us. The summit was to help stakeholders “understand there is a future. The A340 does a very good job on long, thin routes and hot-and-high airports. There are also A340s that can provide available lift right now as interim capacity while waiting for new aircraft.”

Indeed, Norwegian Air Shuttle wet-leased A340s to cover delays in deliveries of the Boeing 787 and in-service interruptions.But AirAsiaX dropped low-fare routes between Asia and Europe, then using the A340-300, as uneconomic as fuel prices rose. The airline substituted twin-engine A330s on some services and plans to use A350s in the future.

The A340-200/300 entered service in the early 1990s but quickly was challenged in the marketplace by the twin-engine Boeing 777-200ER and later the -300ER, a more economical aircraft whose utility increased as fuel prices skyrocketed. The A340-500/600 were developed as ultra-long range (ULR) aircraft, which has proved a niche since the days of the Boeing 747SP. Even Boeing’s 777-200LR had limited sales. The A340-300 is regarded even by some within Boeing as a decent aircraft (Boeing took some in on trade for 777 sales), but the -500 is not especially well regarded in the market, which cast its vote with only 34 sales—a highly limited number even for ULRs. The larger capacity A340-600 sold three times the number of the -500, but by this time the A340 was eclipsed by the 777-300ER.

The 200/300 have CFM56 engines; the 500/600 have Rolls-Royce engines.

Fuel prices have eased a bit—now about $95bbl vs $103bbl a month ago—which helps the A340, says an Airbus official. However, prices are anything but stable.

One person attending the summit said that lease rates for the A340 need to be in the $340,000/mo range to offset the fuel disadvantage. According to Aviation Specialists, a 10 year old A340-300 has a current market value of $24m and a base value of $35m. These values suggest a lease rate of between $240,000-$350,000/mo. The -500s and -600s have higher values.

Collateral Verifications indicates current lease rates for the -300 at $320,000/mo for a 10-year old model. Collateral has lease rates of $425,000 and $500,000 for the -500 and -600 respectively.

“The A340 has just such an awful reputation, nobody wants to touch it,” says one person trying to find a market for the aircraft. “Everybody is just petrified of the Trent [engine on the 500 and 600]. The CFM engine is OK.”

But some believe there continues to be opportunity in the Southern Hemisphere and with carriers that find ETOPS qualification a challenge.

Nico Buchholz, the fleet planner at Lufthansa Airlines, which has a large fleet of A340-300s and A340-600s, praises the aircraft for certain routes.

“On a 4,000 meter runway between Frankfurt and Chicago, the [new] 777X is so much better,” he told us. “But it’s so much more expensive.” For a small, start-up long-haul airline, or one that would have challenges meeting ETOPS (extended twin-engine over water operations) requirements, Buchholz says an inexpensive A340 will be an attractive alternative.

He also characterized the A340-600 “as the best aircraft to Mexico City,” beating any 777 “hands down. The CASM (cost per available seat mile) is cheaper to Mexico City than the 777.”

Buchholz says Lufthansa’s A340s are all fully depreciated (which was over 12 years to 15% of the original purchase price), eliminating about 20% of the cost basis.

(Text continues below Table.)

Airbus claimed at the summit that the A340 is more economical than the 777 in certain comparisons, a view scoffed at by Kostya Zolotusky, managing director of Capital Market Leasing for Boeing Capital Corp.

“If I believe what they said, I’ll be looking day-by-day for headlines that they will restart their production line. Most of the time they’re sensible but this was a little awkward,” he told us in an interview.

Andreas Herrmann, VP A340 Asset Management, spoke with us after the Summit. Key points made there:



Airbus says the A340-300, which is lighter than the 777-200ER, uses 5% less fuel per trip with 300 and 312 passengers respectively;

The A340-600 is lighter than a Boeing 747-400 but heavier than a new 777-300ER. Accordingly, Airbus says that it uses 21% less fuel than the 744 but 12% more fuel than the 773ER. Passenger counts assumed are 475, 510 and 475 respectively, the maximum allowed by exit limits. Range assumed is 4,000nm (a typically A346 mission).

The 475 passenger count is the new capacity Airbus will seek to certify for the A346, which will lower cost per available seat mile by 7% and increase revenue potential by 35 seats, or an 8% increase in capacity, for a potential $5.5m/yr in increased revenue.

If an airline wants to replace the 744 or wants to add lift that is available now (vs a long lead time for next generation airplanes) or seeks a lower capital cost solution, and it has other Airbus aircraft in the fleet, commonality in training, parts, maintenance, etc., can save the carrier $1.25m a year per airplane instead of introducing a new fleet type.

ETOPS certification is unnecessary with an A340.

Airbus claims the A346 has a monthly revenue potential advantage over the 744 of $557,000 after all cost factors are considered. This assumes wall-to-wall people of 475 passengers for the A346 and 510 for the 744, $3 fuel and a 4,000nm mission.

Airbus also claims an economic advantage for a “mature” A346 vs a new 777-300ER, largely on a much smaller capital cost. The assumed lease rate for the A346 is $450,000/mo vs $1.3m for the 773ER. This delta provides an economic advantage to the Airbus of $433,000/mo, according to Hermann.

Similar assumptions give the A340-500 an economic advantage over the 777-200LR, Hermann says, amounting to $216,000/mo.

The A340-300’s advantage over the 777-200ER–again, largely but not entirely on capital cost assumptions–is pegged at $356,000/mo.

“The new 475 maximum passenger capacity allows the A340-600 to enter into the request from the secondary market of aircraft capable of 450-500 seat capacity and the A340-600, with this new certification at 475 seat, can fill it in a more efficient way,” Airbus told us.

Airbus says that the 744 seat count used is based on what is the average seat count of the three to four highest capacity 744 operators. It can be one or two classes (as the A346). “Being a bigger module, the 744 can carry on average more passengers than the A346, but due to its higher fuel burn (+21% per trip) vs the A346 and its aging factor in the maintenance cost, is less efficient than the A346,” Airbus says.

The A340-500, an ultra-long range airplane with a 9,000nm capability, was produced in few numbers and one-third are VIP models. Hermann said this is the principal future for this aircraft.

Rolls-Royce’s Total Care package has been criticized as too costly and inflexible. Herrmann said RR pledged to improve the program. CFM engines power the A340-300 and Performance Improvement Programs are available.

One appraiser, who did not attend the event, remained skeptical, saying that the A340-300 is a difficult aircraft to place and which has a scrap value of $5m-$10m.

Airbus Military reveals more details of C295 firefighter programme - Airbus,"Wed, 11 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxMy0xMi1haXJidXMtbWlsaXRhcnktcmV2ZWFscy1tb3JlLWRldGFpbHMtb2YtYzI5NS1maXJlZmlnaHRlci1wcm9ncmFtbWXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"C295 firefighter programme<br /> low resol

Airbus Military has completed a second round of tests of its prototype C295 firefighting aircraft which will provide detailed data on the performance of its water dropping system.

Following earlier testing of the system, the company conducted seven water drops at a special range near Cordoba, Spain using ground equipment designed to measure the dispersal pattern of the water.

The trials were successfully completed and showed good initial promise, confirming the aircraft’s highly satisfactory handling during the drop procedure. In the coming weeks the data will be examined in detail to enable decisions to be taken on the final configuration of the C295 firefighter.

In the trials the aircraft carried one 3,500 litre tank and the water was gravity-ejected through two dispensers in the belly.

The planned configuration would offer double that capacity with two 3,500 litre tanks being deployed using a roll-on/roll-off system which would permit the aircraft to be used for transport purposes when not required for firefighting duties – greatly increasing its cost-effectiveness.

Jeronimo Amador, Airbus Military HO Market Development, Light & Medium aircraft said: “We are pleased with the progress of the testing we have performed so far and very encouraged by the results. We will now analyse the data in greater detail and intensify our contacts with potential customers interested in the C295 as a firefighter. A roll-on, roll-off solution based on this highly flexible aircraft has excellent potential to address the financial challenges faced by authorities responsible for aerial firefighting worldwide.”

About C295

The new generation C295 is the ideal aircraft for defence and civic missions to the benefit of society, such as humanitarian actions, homeland security, and environmental surveillance. Thanks to its robustness and reliability, simple systems, and optimal cabin, this medium sized tactical airlifter provides wide versatility and flexibility, necessary for personnel, troop and bulky/palletized cargo transportation, casualty evacuation, communication and logistic duties, and air-dropping. Its flexible design, long endurance and modern systems have made it an outstanding platform for a wide range of ISR roles including anti-submarine and ship warfare, airborne early warning, and maritime surveillance. The C295 is part of Airbus Military’s family of light and medium airlifters which also includes the smaller NC212i and CN235 platforms. In the fourth quarter of 2014 Airbus Military will introduce the C295W, featuring as standard winglets and higher engine power ratings, giving increased performance in all flight phases and lower fuel burn.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9998781681060791}",positive,0.9998781681060791,1

On Friday, the order was revised.

In an filing Friday, American Airlines – which merged with US Airways on Dec. 9 – said that the company and Airbus have amended the agreement to state that its 22 A350s will be A350-900s. Deliveries will begin in 2017.

The revised order skews the AA order book for the A350 to the larger size. As originally announced on Oct. 4, 2007, 18 were to be the smaller A350-800s with only four to be the A350-900s.

The A350-900 will be the first of that family to be delivered to airlines, with that type sandwiched between the A350-800 and A350-1000. Airbus says the A350-900 would carry 315 passengers in a two-class configuration, with a range of up to 7,750 nautical miles, or about 8,900 miles.

Originally, US Airways was to get its first A350 in 2014. In 2009, it announced the schedule had slipped to 2017, with all to arrive by the end of 2019.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999939203262329}",neutral,0.9999939203262329,0
Battle for the future of the skies: Boeing 787 Dreamliner v Airbus A380 - The Guardian,"Sun, 29 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEzL2RlYy8yOS9ib2VpbmctNzg3LWRyZWFtbGluZXItYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtYmF0dGxlLWZvci1za2llc9IBY2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEzL2RlYy8yOS9ib2VpbmctNzg3LWRyZWFtbGluZXItYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtYmF0dGxlLWZvci1za2llcw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For a supposedly quiet plane, there has always been a lot of noise around the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. From the unveiling of its pioneering design in 2004 to the first delivery in 2011, there was an industry buzz. Then mutterings of concern grew into a chorus of alarm in January, when safety authorities grounded the fleet after a spate of incidents, including a burning battery.

But after a few relatively trouble-free months, Boeing's insistence that these were just teething troubles has been accepted and orders have grown.

Randy Tinseth, Boeing's vice-president for marketing, landed on a lot of tarmac during 2013, selling the plane and restating its merits to customers anxiously reviewing their purchases. ""It wasn't a great start,"" he admits. ""We clearly had challenges early in the year … and the disruption that presented.""

The most alarming challenge was a battery that caught fire on a Japan Airlines plane, fortunately on the ground at Boston airport. Other 787s suffered fuel leaks and one was forced to make an emergency landing. By mid-January the US federal aviation authority had grounded the worldwide fleet.

""As you can imagine it was a very difficult situation. It's very rare when you have to … take planes out of service. We had an unprecedented response inside the company to identify the work we had to do with the testing, and to incorporate the fix for those in service and those in production.""

The 787 returned to the skies in April and glitches have been rare. The last high-profile incident was a fire on an Ethiopian Airlines plane at Heathrow in July. ""The airlines are telling us it's delivering,"" Tinseth says. The feedback from passengers has been amazing.""

Boeing's marketing boss would say that, but people at the sharp end seem to agree. British Airways pilot Mitch Preston flew the first 787 in BA livery and is managing the model's entry into service. He says passengers consistently say they arrive feeling better. ""It's not marketing fluff, it really isn't.""

Low fuel consumption and reduced noise have been the big selling points, but a key part of the 787's appeal to passengers is the increased cabin pressure said to alleviate the ill-effects of flying. Preston says: ""Typically I get off a 787 flight feeling less tired and dehydrated."" He also likes the lighter cabin and the views from its bigger windows.

BA waited decades for a pioneering new plane, then two turned up at once. The Dreamliner arrived in the same week as BA's first Airbus A380. Both had been ordered years earlier, but the 787 was delayed in production hell and A380 was deferred by BA itself as recession made it wary of the doubledecker superjumbo.

Captain James Basnett is Preston's counterpart for the A380. ""Everybody who flies the A380 loves it. It's very impressive, efficient, reliable. We did all the flying without a hitch and crews love it,"" he says.

As with the 787, the plane may be dramatically different but the cockpit is designed for continuity for pilots, albeit with a host of technological improvements.

""The flightdeck is slightly more complex, but with more tools to help us – cameras, electronic flight displays and an electronic flight bag."" The latter, which the 787 also offers, aims to reduce the headaches and weight of paperwork.

Passenger feedback has been effusive, Bassnett says. ""You notice the width and height in the cabin. It's noticeably quieter."" One downside of which is that ""you can hear people snore"". But not the co-pilot, he adds.

The A380 has ""the best of a small aircaft on a big aircraft and a lot of technology you don't see elsewhere"", he says. There wouldn't be a pilot on the fleet who wouldn't prefer it. They'd say it was the most enjoyable plane they'd ever flown"".

Preston, however, says: ""There are very few pilots in the world who'll not say the plane he's flying is the best thing. I don't begrudge James what he's flying, but on this issue he's wrong."" Size isn't everything? ""Indeed.""

The earlier problems with the 787, he says, never enter his mind. A more important endorsement came this month from his employers, who booked 18 more Dreamliners – the pending ""double-stretched"" 787-10 model. BA has also ordered the same number of A350s, widely seen as Airbus's riposte to the Dreamliner. It uses similar lightweight composite materials and by the time of delivery may include a version of the lithium-ion batteries.

The airline's stance reflects the broader aviation picture. The purchase of an A380 or 787 is far less a decision between manufacturers than a question of competing visions of the economics and future of air travel. Airlines carrying high volumes of passengers on major routes favour the A380, and Emirates - by far the largest customer - has refitted its Dubai hub to service its fleet, which is set to reach 140 planes. Five depart Heathrow for Dubai daily. At crowded airports where slots are at a premium, putting more customers on each plane taking off can make real sense.

But if the A380 is, as an Airbus spokesman put it, a ""congestion buster"", the 787 is better known as a ""hub buster"" – one that rewrites traditional models of funnelling connecting passengers onto the jumbos that make long-haul flying viable. With fewer seats, its fuel efficiency and range are enabling the likes of a direct Heathrow-Austin connection – BA's next new route for 2014 – even with less passenger demand than established routes.

On the simple comparison of orders, the 787 is beating the A380, though Airbus has the satisfaction of knowing its superjumbo is slowly wiping the ageing Boeing 747 from the skies.

Technical problems did ground a Norwegian Air Dreamliner last week in the US, but burning batteries and emergency landings are slowly becoming a more distant chapter in the 787's story. It is now approaching 100m miles in service and last month surpassed 1,000 orders. Tinseth says: ""The technologies are being proven … Was it a risk worth taking? Absolutely.""

American Airlines Unveils its New Airbus A321 Transcontinental - NYCAviation - NYCAviation,"Wed, 18 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55Y2F2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDEzLzEyL25ldy1hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy11bnZlaWxzLW5ldy1haXJidXMtYTMyMS10cmFuc2NvbnRpbmVudGFsLzMyMDI30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Big changes are happening at American Airlines: a new livery after 46 years, a merger with US Airways to become the world’s largest airline and the reintroduction of Airbus aircraft into its fleet. Most recently, its latest aircraft addition was on display at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK). Its first Airbus A321 Transcontinental (A321T) was delivered last month but before it begins revenue service in January 2014, NYCAviation was given an opportunity to check it out.

Once at American’s Terminal 8, we were escorted from the Flagship Lounge to Gate 46 where the new plane sat amongst a snowy backdrop. This A321T (registration N101NN) was scheduled to travel to Los Angeles later in the day for a similar unveiling, but not before receiving her New York debut. American provided quite a welcome for the media. The gate area was lively and excitement was building prior to boarding. We were welcomed and given a brief overview of the Airbus A321T by Jim Carter, Managing Director of American’s Eastern Sales Division. Not long afterward, we were welcomed onto the aircraft to get a first look at the upgrades.

Even while waiting to board in the jetway, we were still able to catch a whiff of that new-airplane smell. Upon entering, the spaciousness of the cabin was immediately apparent, especially with the two abreast (1-1 configuration) seating in first class. Previously, these seats were only available on long haul, international flights. As such, American is the only domestic carrier to offer all three classes on these routes. The 10 first class seats are all fully lie-flat with a 21-inch width, 62-inch pitch, a bed length of 82.5 inches and an HD 15.4-inch touchscreen at each. The remote has its own smaller touchscreen, which not only controls the entertainment system, but also doubles as a secondary display so you can check out your live position on the map without needing to interrupt anything playing on the main screen.

The same lie-flat seating applies to business class as well, albeit with four abreast seating (2-2). Nonetheless, business class also gets you the same 15.4-inch IFE. It’s definitely by no means cramped, either, with a seat width of either 18.5 or 19.5 inches depending on whether you’re in the aisle or window seat, 58-inch pitch, and a bed length of 75 or 78 inches, again depending on your seat. The cabins on the A321T roughly split the aircraft into thirds. The aft third consists of half Main Cabin Extra, and half Main Cabin (economy). Main Cabin Extra offers a 35-inch seat pitch, an extra four inches of pitch over economy’s 31 inches, and up to six inches of extra legroom. Both Main Cabin and Main Cabin Extra feature 8.9-inch HD touchscreen IFEs. The Airbus A321T is the largest of the A320 family which also includes the A318, A319 and A320, while sharing the same type rating for pilots.

American will gradually replace its Boeing 767 service to Los Angeles (LAX) and San Francisco (SFO) with the new A321T. Carter broke down the schedule as follows:

• Out of the initial 10 daily flights between JFK and LAX, two are to be operated with the A321T beginning January 7th. That increases to five per day on January 15th, up to eight on February 12th, and finally 13 frequencies on June 11th.

• On March 6th, two of the four flights between JFK and SFO will be operated by the A321T and that will increase to five on June 11th.

American Airlines’ new airplanes for these routes and the service provided represent a significant improvement from the antiquated Boeing 767-200 not just in terms of capacity, but also amenities. Several of American’s competitors either already have or are in the process of upgrading their offering in the transcontinental market. American is now keeping pace, and the changes will likely please travelers, especially those who frequently fly American between JFK and SFO or LAX.

ANALYSIS: Can Airbus and R-R kick-start A340 revival? - Flightglobal,"Wed, 11 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYW5hbHlzaXMtY2FuLWFpcmJ1cy1hbmQtci1yLWtpY2stc3RhcnQtYTM0MC1yZXZpdmFsLzExMTk0OS5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus, Rolls-Royce and CFM International spent a day in London last week seeking to convince the market that the A340 represents a good investment, despite its operating economics being buffeted by high fuel prices.

The event was kicked off by none other than Airbus’s top salesman John Leahy and attended by over 100 delegates, who included bankers, financiers, lessors, appraisers and brokers.

Production of the four-engined widebody ended in 2012 after 377 deliveries, including 246 CFM International CFM56-powered A340-200/300s and 131 Rolls-Royce Trent 500-powered -500/600s. 358 aircraft remain in operation, according to Flighglobal’s Ascend Online database.

While the meeting’s agenda covered all variants, much of the focus was on the largest model, the A340-600, of which there are 97 in existence.

The fundamental problem Airbus and owners face with the A340-600 is highlighted by its value performance, compared with the 777-300ER.

“To use direct benchmarks, a 10-year-old A340-600 has a current market value of $40.5 million, which equates to 36% of its $112 million original new value, whereas a 777-300ER of a similar age is worth $83.5 million which is 73% of the $114.6 million value when new,” says Rob Morris, head of advisory at Flightglobal’s consultancy arm Ascend.

“On the ‘standard’ 25-year-to-15% depreciation policy typically used by operating lessors, a 10-year old aircraft should be at 66% of its original value. I guess this sets the issue completely in context.”

High operating costs of the four-engined 359-seater (two-class), exacerbated by the spike in fuel prices in recent years, has impacted the attractiveness of the A340-600 (and its ultra-long-range sister, the -500) to operators and investors. Airbus openly admits that the A340-600 has inferior operating economics to the 777-300ER, to the tune of 12% higher fuel burn per trip on a 4,000nm (7,400km) sector (assuming each is fitted with 475 seats). Boeing puts the deficit much greater, claiming that the 777-300ER burns 34% less fuel than the A340-600, on a per-seat basis.

To mitigate against the fuel burn deficit, R-R has developed an “EP+"" improvement package for the Trent 500, which it says can save an airline up to $200,000 of fuel per aircraft per year. However observers believe that the A340-500/600’s appeal can also be hampered by R-R’s Total Care engine support programme, which has come in for criticism from the lessors and financiers as it has implications for residual values.

Airbus and R-R talked up the A340-600 by unveiling plans for a high-density seating configuration and undertaking to address criticism of high engine maintenance costs. Airbus aims to have a new exit limit of 475 passengers approved within 10-12 months, which will deliver a claimed 7% improvement in cash operating costs. R-R has pledged to adapt its Total Care programme to bring the cost per engine flight hour of four Trent 500s to the same or less than that of two older Trent 800s or General Electric GE90s (engines that power rival Boeing 777s). It describes the initiative as “flexible Rolls-Royce services – priced to fly”.

During the presentation, Airbus cited a number of “opportunities” for the A340, which included: “cost efficient capacity available short-term; replacement of other aging aircraft; interim lift before the A350 XWB; charter/niche operators with high capacity requirements; long-haul start-ups; and VIP and governments”.

But the jury is still out as to whether enough has been done to convince everyone that the aircraft is worth a second look. According to industry sources, there has not yet been a sufficient level of detail to enable a full assessment of the undertakings by Airbus and its partners to boost the A340’s market appeal. “Reputations die hard,” says one source.

Observers point out that R-R’s “four for the price of two” promise has been heard before, but Airbus is adamant that it is serious this time: “That is where Rolls is very happy that they will be proven, not on their words, but on their actions,” says Andreas Hermann, vice president of freighters and A340 asset management at Airbus.

With its 475-seat A340-600, Airbus sees a market to replace high-density Boeing 747-400s operated by charter operators, and also has the 777-300ER in its sights. Airbus claims that when fuel burn, ownership costs and other factors (such as maintenance cost and commonality benefits) are considered, the A340-600’s “contribution to profit” is $557,000 per month greater than the 747-400 and $433,000 better than the 777-300ER (see table).

“One thing is what the market could do and another is what it chooses to,” says Ascend aviation analyst Maximo Gainza. “The A340-600 may work beautifully in the high-density configuration being certificated next year, but realistically how broad is the appeal? Can this really herald a recovery in values and market perception, or is it too little, too late?”

Airline operators are Airbus’s main focus as it seeks homes for five A340-600s it is remarketing. However VIP customers are targeted for four ex-Singapore Airlines A340-500s on its books.

According to Ascend Online, 15 of the 34 A340-500s delivered are currently parked. The variant’s image took a bit of a knock recently when president Tim Clark revealed that Emirates was beginning to withdraw its 10 aircraft parting out its first.

“When we bought the -500, it was the only aeroplane that could fly nonstop to the west coast of the USA or the east coast of Australia,” says Clark. “Unfortunately for Airbus, nobody foresaw fuel doing what it did.”

Airbus is offering an “ACJ340” corporate jet version of the -500 which it says has “availability as early as 2015”. A propose configuration features three VIP rooms and 98 passenger seats.

According to Airbus, there are currently 25 A340s available for sale or lease. Airbus is remarketing 16 of these, including seven -300s, four -500s and five -600s. “For quite a few of these we have a solution to be announced sometime soon,” Hermann says.

PHOTO TOUR: Inside American Airlines’ Trans-Con Airbus A321 - Airline Reporter,"Wed, 18 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMy8xMi9waG90by10b3VyLWluc2lkZS1hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy10cmFucy1jb24tYWlyYnVzLWEzMjEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This story was written for AirlineReporter.com by Eric Dunetz (@southpawcapture)

Out with the old and in with the new.

American Airlines showed off their brand-new Airbus A321 at John F Kennedy International Airport (JFK) on Tuesday and upped the game in the ever-competitive transcontinental market. I was invited to take a tour.

The A321 with be replacing American’s aging Boeing 767-200 on the JFK/LAX route starting January 7th, and the JFK/SFO shortly thereafter, and will offer a welcomed upgrade for passengers.

American will be the only carrier to offer a three-class cabin, featuring fully lie-flat seats in both First and Business Class, on a narrow-body aircraft. The First Class cabin will be outfitted with 10 fully lie-flat seats in a 1-1 configuration, giving each seat direct aisle access.

Business class will have 20 fully lie-flat seats in a 2-2 configuration. Each premium class seat features a 15.4-inch HD-capable touchscreen monitor offering a selection of in-flight entertainment including movies, TV programs, audio selections, and games.

In Main Cabin (economy) every seat will have an 8.9-inch HD-capable touchscreen monitor with an assortment of movies, TV programs, games and audio selections. Only a portion of the content is free.

For a narrow-body trans-con product, I think American’s new A321T has taken the lead on these routes. It will be interesting how American will compete with JetBlue’s new Mint product and United’s more established PS.

The new product mirrors quite nicely the look on American’s new Boeing 777-300ER and continues the airline’s move to become the #NewAmerican. But the question still remains; will the flag on the tail stay on this A321 or will it be replaced with the classic AA logo?","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999788999557495}",neutral,0.9999788999557495,0
Nearly all A350 buyers opt for 18-in seat width - Runway Girl Network,"Sat, 21 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTMvMTIvbmVhcmx5LWFsbC1hMzUwLWJ1eWVycy1vcHQtZm9yLTE4LWluLXNlYXQtd2lkdGgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For the past few months, Airbus has been campaigning for an 18-in seat width standard on long-haul aircraft, even though the European airframer continues to advertise the option for airlines to order a high-efficiency A330 in 9-abreast configuration with a 16.7-inch seat width and a high-density 10-abreast A350.

Airbus also recently tabled a plan to A340-600 operators that would allow them to configure their aircraft with a whopping 475 seats after clearing certification hurdles, in a bid to make the out-of-production widebodies more appealing.

Some industry observers believe that, in flogging an 18-in “comfort” standard while actively pitching super snug, high-density configurations, Airbus is talking out of both sides of its mouth. Lufthansa has already said it does not support Airbus’ campaign.

Airbus VP cabin innovation & design Ingo Wuggetzer disagrees, saying the airframer is being forward thinking, and considering the next generation of traveler. “In general, we see people are growing more in width than height, so there should be a demand and I think we also have a good position because we have the best cross section in the market. So we should make use of it. [So we’re] offering seat width that is superior, and is made for that next generation of traveller,” he says.

Wuggetzer notes that Airbus didn’t draw conclusions about an 18-in comfort standard on its own. “We also asked our questions during a customer workshop in June on a survey we performed based on several seating configurations.”

He also reveals that all Airbus A350 customers “except one low-cost carrier” has adhered to an 18-in seat width in economy. Flightglobal in May 2012 reported that AirAsia X had ordered its A350s in two-class configuration, with 10-abreast in economy. But one can’t help but wonder if other airlines will follow suit, as the market has wholly embraced the 10-abreast 777-300ER and its 777X successor (even in the face of passenger consternation about 10-abreast).

But what happens when an Airbus operator wants to offer both a high-density configuration AND an 18-in seat width in economy? Airbus faces that challenge now in trying to develop an 11-abreast interior for the A380.

Emirates appears to be growing more comfortable with the prospect of offering 11-abreast A380s in a 3-5-3 configuration. The carrier, which previously said it eschews the idea of 3-5-3, reportedly told Air Transport World that Emirates would offer 3-5-3 if it opts for 11-abreast on the double-decker aircraft. “The middle seat of the five would be a difficult one to have. We are working on how to deal with that,” Emirates president Tim Clark is quoted as saying. He stressed, however, that Emirates would not allow seat width to fall below 18 inches.

Airbus is working on a number of innovations to maximize seat width comfort. Asked whether the airframer might consider removing traditional window seat armrests, Wuggetzer said, “Generally I think there is some room to improve still and we have some buffers that we have not used so far.” But he would not address the A380 specifically.

Offering bench-like seats on aircraft might not be out of the question in the future, suggests Routehappy director of data John Walton. “I think there are certainly families that would like that option. The question is where do you put the armrests that you take away. Can you do something clever with this, particularly towards the front of the plane on short-haul? Can you use a tempur-style material or memory foam as a seat surface with attachable and detachable armrests that lock in safely and securely, yet unlock?”

The Seymourpowell-proposed Morph seat that was doing the “isn’t it cool” rounds recently is an example of advanced materials engineering solutions that could work – assuming, of course, that it passes safety considerations, says Walton. “Cathay Pacific, for instance, uses different types of foam on its James Park Associates-designed Cirrus seats. So how do we structurally recreate that to move away from the very rigidly defined seat we have now, into more customizable options?”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9548423290252686}",neutral,0.9548423290252686,0
Airbus and Rolls unveil plan to restore A340-600 appeal - Flightglobal,"Thu, 05 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWFuZC1yb2xscy11bnZlaWwtcGxhbi10by1yZXN0b3JlLWEzNDAtNjAwLWFwcGVhbC8xMTE5MDguYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus and Rolls-Royce aim to boost the market appeal of the A340-600 with reconfiguration and support initiatives that address operating costs.

The plan was unveiled in London on 4 December to an audience of over 100 delegates, who included bankers, appraisers, brokers, financiers and lessors.

""The meeting was to demonstrate Airbus, Rolls-Royce and CFM’s joint common commitment to the A340 programme,"" says Andreas Hermann, vice-president of freighters and A340 asset management at Airbus. ""The key message is that it is not only one party, it’s all three parties who are very committed to the A340 programme.""

Airbus has delivered a total of 377 A340s, including 246 CFM56-powered A340-200/300s and 131 R-R Trent 500 powered -500/600s. It is currently remarketing 16 A340s, including seven -300s, four -500s and five -600s, says Hermann. ""For quite a few of these we have a solution to be announced sometime soon,"" he adds.

Airbus acknowledges that the A340-600 burns 12% more fuel than the similarly sized Boeing 777-300ER, but it claims the four-engined aircraft can be competitive thanks to its lower ownership costs, which it claims averages $850,000 per month, and by tackling engine maintenance costs. Central to the latter is a pledge by R-R to bring maintenance costs for an A340’s four Trent 500s in line with those of a pair of General Electric GE90-115Bs, which power the 777-300ER.

A presentation given by Airbus at the conference included a slide about engine manufacturer support for the Trent 500 which stated: ""Four engines for the price of two (four Trent 500 = two GE90-115)"".

In response to cynicism that this pledge is nothing new, Hermann says: “That is where Rolls is very happy that they will be proven, not on their words, but on their actions.”

SOURCE: Airbus

Airbus has also undertaken to certificate a high-density seating configuration for the A340-600 by raising the exit limit from the current 440 seats to 475. This configuration centres on a one-class all-economy layout with eight-abreast seating using 18in (46cm) wide seats at 31/32in pitch. ""To go to 475 seats does not compromise the comfort standards,"" says Hermann.

However, Airbus is also offering an alternative two-class layout which uses narrower economy seats to permit nine-abreast seating. This has 18 business-class seats and 457 economy seats, the latter being 16.7in wide.

""The 475-seat certification requires about a 10-12 month lead time project and as it stands today we do not need to go through an evacuation test,"" says Hermann. ""There is market interest and Airbus has committed to go ahead and do it. It is not subject to a customer commitment but we are having discussions and we’ll shortly have customers signing up for it.""

Airbus says it is targeting operators of high-density Boeing 747-400s operated by charter operators with the 475-seat A340-600. It claims that the -600 burns 21% less fuel per trip and although the 747 has higher revenue-earning potential and lower ownership costs, a 475-seat A340 has an overall cost monthly advantage of $557,000.

Airbus in bid to boost A340 value as asset guarantees loom - Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 05 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHA6Ly9maW5hbmNlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1iaWQtYm9vc3QtYTM0MC12YWx1ZS0xNDQ4MTc4MDguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus and its engine makers have acted to try to shore up the value of second-hand A340 aircraft as the European planemaker tries to reduce its financial exposure to depressed market values of an aircraft that it no longer produces.

Airbus has told bankers, airlines and other owners of the aircraft that it is working on plans to increase the maximum capacity by 8 percent to 475 seats in a bid to make it more attractive to airlines looking to replace Boeing 747-400s.

Britain's Rolls-Royce (RR.TO) is also restructuring engine service contracts so that airlines can maintain the aircraft's four engines for a similar cost to servicing the two General Electric (GE) engines on the rival 777-300ER, according to industry presentations released on Thursday.

The move comes after parent EADS said in its 2012 annual report that Airbus was ""currently engaged in taking mitigation action to reduce the impact of asset value guarantees falling due in the coming years relating to A340s in particular"".

Airbus stopped making the A340 in 2011 after improvements in engine technology caused airlines to switch to two-engined models such as the Boeing 777 and, in future, the A350.

But it has been left with a financial exposure to the aircraft after issuing guarantees underpinning its resale price when striking deals to sell it during a period of weak demand.

Additionally, it faces potential losses on deals to buy back old A340s as it sells new aircraft of other types, people familiar with the matter said.

As of 31 December 2012, EADS had 1,046 billion euros of asset value guarantees outstanding, excluding 333 million euros where the risk of execution was considered to be remote.

It says the risk covers just part of the residual value of the aircraft and is included in total EADS provisions for asset value risks of 712 million euros, as of December 31 last year.

The company does not break out the guarantees by plane type but analysts say the A340 makes up a significant share.

Story continues

Industry sources say airlines have begun breaking up old A340s because their parts are sometimes worth more than the cost of scrapping the plane. Some have been trying to sell them because of the perceived inefficiency of running four engines instead of the now-standard two engines on long trips.

Some 25 second-hand A340s are currently posted for sale.

Airbus officials urged a special meeting of A340 owners hosted by Airline Economics to reconsider the value of the four-engined aircraft and argued it could hold its own as an interim long-haul plane before the arrival of the new A350.

Airbus said it is working to get the plane certified for 475 seats in all-economy seating.

According to Perth Now, an electrical storm on Sunday night delayed flights into the airport. The video was posted to YouTube. The lighting strike happens just after the 0:50 mark:

Nearly 90% of lightning strikes to planes are triggered when the aircraft flies into ""a heavily charged area clouds,"" according to the Flight Safety Foundation. ""Aircraft lighting strikes occur frequently,"" the Foundation says, ""although they are rarely associated with accidents.""

Commercial planes usually fly above the weather, so encounter lightning most often during landing and takeoff. They are once per year on average, Professor Manu Haddad of Cardiff University's Morgan Botti Laboratory told The Guardian in 2012.

""It is routine for an aircraft to land as soon as possible after a strike, but this is a precautionary measure,"" Haddad said. ""Lightning is extremely hot – up to 30,000C. The typical damage is a scorch mark where the point of contact was, usually a wing-tip. The plane's electronics are well shielded these days.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9425255060195923}",neutral,0.9425255060195923,0
EC135 operators warned of possible fuel indication errors - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 17 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvZWMxMzUtb3BlcmF0b3JzLXdhcm5lZC1vZi1wb3NzaWJsZS1mdWVsLWluZGljYXRpb24tZXJyb3JzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Eurocopter has issued a Safety Information Notice to EC135 operators regarding the fuel indicator system errors that grounded some Bond Air Services helicopters last week.

According to Eurocopter, Bond and two other EC135 operators in Europe have identified supply-tank fuel gauging errors on some aircraft that could lead to the quantity of fuel being overestimated. In the worst case, the aircraft’s amber fuel caution lights could fail to illuminate prior to fuel reaching critical levels, although the helicopters’ red “Low Fuel” warning lights would continue to operate correctly. The Safety Information Notice advises crews that they must strictly comply with flight manual procedures following illumination of red fuel warning lights, regardless of the indicated fuel level.

Bond Air Services discovered the fault during normal operations on Dec. 11, and took the precautionary measure of temporarily grounding its EC135 fleet to conduct checks of the aircraft. “The results of these tests were subsequently validated by Eurocopter, and appropriate repairs made before returning the aircraft to service,” Bond stated. “We also took the decision to increase safety barriers by mandating that all of our EC135s should maintain a minimum of 90 kilograms of fuel on board at all times.”

The grounding received widespread attention as it came less than two weeks after an EC135 operated by Bond Air Services on behalf of Police Scotland crashed into a busy pub in Glasgow, killing 10 people. However, the fuel indicator problem has not been linked to that event, and a special bulletin released by the United Kingdom Air Accidents Investigation Branch reported that the accident EC135 had approximately 95 liters of fuel on board at the time the crash occurred.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8930751085281372}",neutral,0.8930751085281372,0

Total order rises to 140 A380s

Emirates Airline and Airbus have completed discussions and signed the firm contract for 50 additional A380s originally announced at the Dubai Airshow on 17th November 2013. The contract documents were finalised by Tim Clark, Emirates Airline President, during a visit to Airbus’ Headquarters in Toulouse, France.

Tim Clark, President Emirates Airline said on the occasion: ’œThe A380 is our flagship aircraft. It is popular with our customers and delivers results for us in terms of operational performance. That is why we have ordered these additional 50 aircraft, to add to our A380 fleet.’

’œThis order is a major vote of confidence in the A380. Since delivery of their first aircraft in July 2008, Emirates’ A380 fleet has grown to be the largest in the world with 44 A380s in operation. We congratulate Emirates on this impressive achievement and thank the airline for their continued support of our flagship aircraft. As Tim Clark has often said, “The A380 really is a game-changing aircraft.’ commented John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer, Customers.

Since first entering service in 2007, to date 122 A380s have been delivered, to ten world class carriers. The aircraft flies 8,500 nautical miles or 15,700 kilometres non-stop, carrying more people at lower cost and with less impact on the environment. The spacious, quiet cabin and smooth ride have made the A380 a firm favourite with both airlines and passengers, resulting in higher load factors wherever it flies.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9749727249145508}",neutral,0.9749727249145508,0

The CMA-9000 includes full-performance, coupled vertical navigation functionality, and the capability to fly all of the latest descents and approaches with significantly improved efficiency, control and annunciation. Its large, single navigation database allows global operations to significantly more destinations than the legacy FMS. Modern datalink capability is available as a service bulletin. CMC worked in cooperation with Mid-Canada Mod Center for the STC’d modification.

According to Jim Palmer, vice president, aviation products, Esterline CMC Electronics, “This FMS upgrade breathes new life into this legacy Airbus aircraft. The certification ushers in a new generation of airline FMS retrofits that bring operational efficiency and safety to aircraft, and many productive years of operation. It also marks the first time that an airline FMS was replaced with a more modern FMS, as an STC rather than an original equipment manufacturer program.”

Under the contract, Future Air Navigation (FANS-1) functionality will be added to the five aircraft. The FANS-1 functionality includes Airline Operational Communication (AOC) and Controller-Pilot Datalink Communications (CPDLC) functions via the CMA-9000 FMS in association with newly installed communication avionics.

British Airways plans denser seating on Airbus fleet – Business Traveller - Business Traveller,"Thu, 19 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzdHJhdmVsbGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMTMvMTIvMTkvYmEtcGxhbnMtZGVuc2VyLXNlYXRpbmctb24tYWlyYnVzLWZsZWV0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"British Airways will begin installing new seating across its Airbus fleet next year.

As part of the refit, BA is believed to be reducing the seat pitch in Club Europe (business) on its A320 short-haul aircraft from 34 inches to 30 inches, the same legroom as in economy, although middle seats B and E will remain unoccupied.

It plans to do this by installing slimline B/E Pinnacle seats (right) across the fleet and by adding extra rows of seating, although it is unclear whether this will be achieved by removing wardrobe space or a washroom, or possibly both.

The net result might be to increase the capacity on BA’s A320 aircraft to 172 seats.

On the airline’s existing A320 fleet of more than 40 aircraft, there are various different seats and configurations.

Seating capacity is a mixture of 135 passengers (seatplan here), 162 passengers (seatplan here) and 168 passengers on some domestic services that are retro-fitted Airbus jets from BMI.

On those aircraft offering Club Europe seating, passengers are currently guaranteed an aisle or window seat, with middle seats B and E blocked out. They also enjoy a 34-inch seat pitch, up to row 9, whereas economy passengers have a 30-inch pitch.

The B/E Pinnacle seat has been fitted on several A320-family aircraft delivered to BA this year but, starting in 2014, deliveries will be in a different configuration.

At a recent shareholder presentation by BA owner IAG, it revealed that it aims to increase capacity across British Airways’ Airbus fleet by 6 per cent.

BA is competing on its short-haul routes with both legacy carriers — such as Lufthansa, which itself has installed new slimline Recaro seating on its short haul fleet (see news, December 2010) — and budget airline Easyjet, which is also fitting Recaro seating (see news, March 2013).

Both of these carriers fly the A320 — Lufthansa can accommodate 168 passengers in two classes, while Easyjet can seat 180.

Note, however, that BA is not alone in configuring its short-haul aircraft. Lufthansa is considering removing the rear galleys on its Airbus fleet to fit in more seats (see news, December 2)

Although images of BA’s refit are not yet available, it seems that the seats will have leather covers, since manufacturer BE Aerospace has again selected Muirhead, which supplied the leather for the original seating.

A statement on Muirheads website says: “The leather update will be carried out across 130 aircraft including the Airbus A319, A320 and A321 models featuring from nose to tail making it available for all passengers to enjoy.”

Business Traveller asked BA for a comment, but a spokesperson said it was too early since the plans are not yet finalised.

The US Coast Guards and the Spanish Navy are operating the CN-235MP ‘Persuaders’ since the early 2000s. In SouthEast Asia, Indonesia has recently inducted the first locally built CN-235MP. Other operators include South Korea, Turkey, Brunai and Malaysia.

While CN-235MP seems as the right choice, Manila said it could also consider the Italian C-27J Spartan tactical transport aircraft, but that plane would have to be converted especially for the maritime patrol role, a process that is likely to be too costly for the budget the Philippines have set aside for the acquisition.

According to the ABS-CBN, these investments are part of the renewed Armed Forces Modernization Act, which took effect in 1995, giving the military a chance to modernize its assets and equipment in 15 years with a $7.5 billion (P331-billion) investment. Back in the 1990s the original program was stalled, but following an evolving conflict with China over the control of the Spratly archipelago last year, President Aquino signed a new modernization law to provide more resources to the military’s upgrade efforts.

The cost of the current modernization program could reach $2 billion (P85 billion). The acquisition program in this budget is the procurement of 12 A/T-50 jet trainers from South Korea, at an estimated cost of about $450 million (P18.9 billion), and a number of naval vessels, acquired from the USA and Italy. The program is funded by nearly $330 million (P15 billion) annual allocation set aside in the national budget until 2017. Additionally, over $100 million (P4.78 billion) will come from proceeds of the Malampaya natural gas project, in which the government has a share from taxes, royalties and charges, and remittances from the Bases Conversion and Development Authority.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999949932098389}",neutral,0.9999949932098389,0

Lufthansa to allow personal electronic devices in all stages of flight - Economy Class & Beyond - Kevin Marshall,"Tue, 24 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL2Vjb25vbXljbGFzc2FuZGJleW9uZC5ib2FyZGluZ2FyZWEuY29tLzIwMTMvMTIvMjQvbHVmdGhhbnNhLXRvLWFsbG93LXBlcnNvbmFsLWVsZWN0cm9uaWMtZGV2aWNlcy1pbi1hbGwtc3RhZ2VzLW9mLWZsaWdodC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Second to the party in Europe, Lufthansa will be allowing the use personal electronic devices during all phases of flight – including taxi, takeoff, flight and landing.

However, the roll-out will be slow with only one fleet of aircraft qualified for use – and that’s the airline’s Boeing 747-8 fleet. This is made up cadre of 9 aircraft.

The change in usage regulations start from 1st January 2014.

Lufthansa’s main line fleet is made up of a 283 aircraft – so, some way to go before the new usage rules are rolled out through the entire fleet. It is planned for the rest of the fleet to gain certification during the first part of 2014.

As usual, this is restricted to personal electronic devices such as tablets, MP3 players, e-readers and phones. Laptop computers will have to be stowed during flight critical phases.

One thing Lufthansa won’t allow – like Southwest, Delta, JetBlue – is phone calls of any type in flight.

From January 1, the German airline will allow the use of small handheld devices from gate-to-gate – including during taxiing, take-off and landing – on-board its Boeing 747-8 aircraft.

All devices will need to remain in “flight mode” throughout.

Whilst it’s disappointing that Lufthansa chose a comparatively small fleet to roll out the new policy onto, it does give the airline a chance to refine the usage policy as needed – so when more the fleet (both long and short haul) have clearance, its safe to do so.

Canary Islands chosen as base for low-cost satellite launches - EL PAÍS USA,"Tue, 17 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5lbHBhaXMuY29tL2VscGFpcy8yMDEzLzEyLzE3L2luZW5nbGlzaC8xMzg3Mjg1ODUzXzA0ODI4NS5odG1s0gFcaHR0cHM6Ly9lbmdsaXNoLmVscGFpcy5jb20vZWxwYWlzLzIwMTMvMTIvMTcvaW5lbmdsaXNoLzEzODcyODU4NTNfMDQ4Mjg1Lmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A computer-generated image supplied by S3 of an Airbus carrying a small spacecraft, which will be able to climb to the edge of space.

A consortium headed by Swiss Space Systems, known as S3, is planning to establish its European operations center in the Canary Islands, from where it says it will carry out orbital launches of small satellites and manned suborbital spaceflights from 2018.

S3 officially launched the project last week in Maspalomas, on the island of Gran Canaria, in the presence of Spain's industry minister, José Manuel Soria López. Among the Spanish companies involved are Elecnor, its technological affiliate Elecnor Deimos, Sener and Aernnova, which have already taken part in several programs run by the European Space Agency (ESA), alongside S3.

The plan is to develop a low-cost system to access space using an Airbus 300 adapted to carry a small spacecraft. The Airbus would ascend to 10,000 meters and then separate from the spacecraft, which would then climb to a height of 100 kilometers, on the edge of space. The spacecraft would also be capable of travelling a further 600 kilometers to launch satellites.

The company plans to offer seats to space tourists from 2020

The company also plans to offer up to four seats for space tourists from 2020, who would make the journey to a height of 100 kilometers, and then return to Earth, where they would make a conventional landing. Both the Airbus and the spacecraft would be reusable. European space leaders such as Dassault and Thales Alenia have a stake in S3. The company says that it can offer highly competitive rates because its aircraft can be reused. Pascal Jaussi, S3's director, says that the cost of its satellite launches is a quarter of the traditional method.

In the meantime, S3 plans to offer parabolic flights aboard the airbus by the end of next year. Parabolic flights provide the experience of zero gravity without entering space, and are often used to train astronauts, carry out research, and provide environments for movies such as Apollo 13 .

The Canary Islands region represents a perfect location to have test facilities for subsystems, mock-up, engines and complete system flight tests in 2017. A Spaceport would be built there for the integration of satellites with the Sub-Orbital Flight System and first commercial launches in 2018.

""Our plan is to establish exactly what role the Spanish companies will be playing in the next phase of the system design, which will address the spacecraft, the modifications required to be made to the Airbus 300, as well as beginning the design of the land-based infrastructure,"" says Augusto Caramagno, the head of S3's Spanish division.

The Canary Islands represents a perfect location to have test facilities

""Spain represents a destination of choice for S3 to achieve its objectives, both in terms of engineering and operations,"" Caramagno adds. ""The main reasons for that lay in the maturity and track record of the Spanish aerospace sector, and the availability of airport infrastructure at various suitable locations for S3 operations."" The company aims to create 80 permanent jobs between now and 2017 stemming from the activities planned for S3-Spain and its partners.

S3-Spain will count on a strong network of partners of its own. Besides Elecnor and Elecnor Deimos, Sener and Aernnova Engineering have both signed agreements with S3. Sener and Elecnor Deimos will cooperate with S3 on the design of the on-board control system, while Aernnova will contribute to the aero-structure of the S3 system.

Speaking at the unveiling of the project, José Manuel Soria highlighted the benefits to the Canary Islands and Spain of participating in the ESA, saying that for every euro the country has invested in the ESA, it has obtained a return of 2.1 euros.

But the minister has come under fire from companies operating in the sector, who point out that the Spanish government has decided to reduce its role in the ESA's upcoming projects, which means that Spanish companies will be specifically excluded from bidding for contracts.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999996542930603}",neutral,0.999996542930603,0

Airbus Military said it was confident the first plane would be delivered in November 2014, and that it was working to develop and qualify the additional military capabilities. “As is normal, there are some challenges, but it’s too early to determine the level of shortfall we might have at the time of delivery,” a spokeswoman said.

But with first flights beginning in 2020, visitors may soon be able to indulge their inner-astronaut here too.

Swiss Space Systems (S3) , a European group of companies, is hoping to ""democratise access to space"" by launching flights from a base outside a beach resort on Gran Canaria.

Budget space flights are being planned from the Canary Islands using an Airbus A300 plane attached to a space shuttle.

The flights are being designed to be as cheap as possible, with the space shuttle detaching from an Airbus A300 aircraft 10 kilometres above Earth. Six people will then be flown 100km further before returning to Earth.

The craft would be reused for each journey, in the same way that an ordinary airline operates, and the shuttle will use standard fuels, meaning it will cost less.

The group has yet to decide what the price of a ticket will be, but said it selected Gran Canaria because of its tourist industry and its location in the Atlantic Ocean, away from populated areas.

European consortium Swiss Space Systems (S3) aims to ""democratise access to space"", with a shuttle designed to sit six passengers piggybacking onto an Airbus A300 launched from base in the Canary Islands.

This first stage would take the shuttle 10km above Earth, at which point it would detach and fire up its own engines to soar skywards for another 100km before returning to earth.

And as you can see from the shuttle's tail livery, Swiss watchmaker Breitling is one of S3's sponsors!

The first test flights are due in 2017 with commervial services slated for 2020.

As a commercial underpinning to S3's longer-term aims, the company sees its unique Airbus+shuttle combo as being a cost-effective way to launch satellites.

One of the first missions, in 2018, will be the launch of CleanSpace One – a satellite designed to clean up the thousands of bits of jettisoned rocket and satellite components orbiting Earth. CleanSpace One will track down this space-borne debris and hurl it into into the atmosphere, where it will burn up on re-entry.

""Our goal is to propose manned flight after having modified our suborbital shuttle for passengers"" says Grégoire Loretan, S3's Head of Communications. ""The first flights will be done in 2020, and in the longer term we will propose suborbital flights for the general public.""

""The goal is not tourism rather a high speed suborbital transport mode for everybody.""

Watch S3's video of how its satellite delivery system would work.

Virgin Galactic is aiming to launch the world's first commercial space flights next year, carrying passengers who've paid as much as US$250,000 each for the privilege.

The first flights will last for two and a half hours and include four minutes of weightlessness as the eight-seater shuttle nudges the edge of space at some 360,000 feet above the Earth's surface.

The order is part of Kuwait Airways’ fleet renewal strategy, the statement said.

“The Airbus family is the ideal choice for an airline like ours,” said Kuwait Airways acting chairman Jassar Al Jassar.

“The A350-900 will strengthen our long haul route development whilst the A320neo will further boost our regional route network. These aircraft are an essential part of our ambitious growth plans.”

The A320neo, offered as an option for the A320 family, incorporates “new more efficient engines and large ‘Sharklet’ wing tip devices, which together will deliver up to 15 per cent in fuel savings,” Airbus said.

Kuwait Airways is expected to receive the planes from 2019 until the end of 2022, a Reuters report said.

The airline may issue bonds or sukuk to finance the deal, the report added, quoting an adviser to Kuwait Airways.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9991483688354492}",neutral,0.9991483688354492,0

At a potentially bum-numbing 16 hours and 20 minutes it's also the world's second-longest flight for any commercial aircraft, coming in barely a half-hour behind US carrier Delta's 16h55m flight 201 from Atlanta to Johannesburg.

Emirates' marathon A380 route flies over Canada, the North Pole and Russia before finally reaching the Gulf carrier's home hub in Dubai – a moment which won't come too soon for those prone to wondering ""Are we there yet?"".

Airbus supersizes the A380 superjumbo - Executive Traveller,"Fri, 27 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXN1cGVyc2l6ZXMtdGhlLWEzODAtc3VwZXJqdW1ib9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If you think the Airbus A380 is already a tightly-packed plane, wait until you see what’s next: a supersized superjumbo with as many as 22% more seats, and an optional 11 seats across in economy.

Airbus revealed the revised A380 layout at its Airbus Innovation Days international media conference in Toulouse, saying that slimline seats and changes to the cabin layout helped boost the bum-count, but held firm that it meant “no compromise in passenger comfort” while also delivering airlines a 7% reduction in cost-per-seat.

The new floorplan boasts 558 seats spread across a standard three-class configuration of first, business and economy, compared to today’s 490 seats in the same mix.

Airbus has allowed for 10 first class mini-suites and 84 business class seats on the upper deck.

Most of the 464 economy seats are found on the lower level but there's also a smaller economy cabin upstairs, nestled behind business class.

Those seats remain in the conventional 10 abreast (3-4-3) layout with 32 inch seat pitch and 18.5 inch width.

The 600-seat superjumbo

“You can even go beyond 558 seats if you take away first class and do a two-class layout, and you get another five rows (of economy)” says Christopher Emerson, Airbus’ Senior Vice-President of Marketing.

That would boost the tally to 598 seats for a 22% increase on the standard 490 seat A380.

The push to fill the world’s largest passenger jet with even more passengers comes on the back of continued growth in travel, especially in Asia.

The A380 is designed to serve what Airbus calls ‘aviation mega-cities’ – airports which see more than 10,000 long-range international passengers every day.

Today that accounts for 42 destinations which Airbus says serve 90% of the world’s long-distance international travel market to fly from, to or through those airports.

By 2021 that’s predicted to jump to 67 mega-cities – eight of which will be in the Asia-Pacific region – and capture over 95% of long-distance travellers.

Sardine mode: 11 abreast seating

By then, even a 600-seat A380 might not be enough to sate the airline’s demands. Cue the heavy organ music, the smoke machines and the appearance of 11 abreast seating in economy.

If it counts for anything, Airbus doesn’t seem too keen to tread this path, even though it lists an 11 abreast option for airlines wishing to “further optimise” the cheap seats.

“Airlines today are not utilising the total capacity of the A380” Emerson explains, “so going (immediately) to 11 abreast is not the first decision you would make as an airline.”

“The first decision you’re going to make is how do I optimise my business class and first class” he reasons.

Upstairs, downstairs...

Emerson believes that many airlines operating the A380 chose to position their first class cabin on the lower level.

The move was made partly out of concern that the pointy end of the upper deck would be too noisy (based on airline’s experience with the Boeing 747, he claims) and also because direct boarding of passengers onto the upper deck wasn’t available at many airports during the A380’s early days.

However, the narrower upper deck is better suited to a more efficient use of space for first class seats in a four-across (1-2-1) layout.

For this reason, airlines could move “premium seating from the main deck to the upper deck, so you can get more economy seats on the main deck”.

“By the time you get to 11 abreast you’ve already found the optimum level of comfort and capacity and you have nowhere else to go” Emerson says.

However, Emerson is quick to stress that he doesn’t see 11 abreast seating as being the solution “for all A380 markets.”

“You’re not going to fly 11 abreast in long-haul flights. 11 abreast is designed for airlines who need that ultra-dense capacity and for shorter flights.”

The Flat Panel Flight Training Device provides procedural training to flight crews as part of type certification, tactical training and mission rehearsal, during which the trainee is briefed about normal and abnormal procedures under a step-by-step flow, before carrying out the procedure in the real cockpit environment.

The device is particularly useful for instructional use as it provides overthe-shoulder training in a classroom-style environment. Its layout makes it easy for an instructor to physically demonstrate or identify equipment or operator issues. Training can be self-driven by the student and lesson support material can be displayed on dedicated screens.

Thales has also designed and built an A400M Full Flight Simulator (FFS) for Airbus Military which received qualification for training in June 2013. Thales is also manufacturing three further Full Flight Simulators for delivery to France, Germany and the UK MoD and a second FPT for delivery to Germany.

Through a joint venture with Airbus Military, Thales has also been selected by the UK MoD for the provision of its through life support training service, which includes the design, construction and management of the A400M training school, the installation and maintenance of full flight simulators and all synthetic training, equipment, and support to the RAF’s own course design team and training staff.

The training school is being built at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, with work planned to complete in spring 2014. The school will train a range of aircrew and ground crew in the operation and maintenance of the RAF’s 22 A400M Atlas aircrafts.

Thales has provided training services for more than 30 years and Thales UK employs around 7,500 staff based at 35 locations. In 2012 Thales UK's revenues were around £1.3 billion. Peter Hitchcock, vice president of Avionics for Thales UK, said: ""Thales has an excellent track record and long-standing experience in the provision of military training solutions. The Flat Panel Flight Training Device that we have just delivered for A400M shares the same heritage as the Full Flight Simulator delivered earlier in the year. They are good examples of the tailored solutions we offer to our customers in response to their need for a family of training products at different price and performance points.”

Thales is a long-standing Airbus partner: Thales is also the main supplier of the A400M’s Cockpit Display Systems (CDS). Its technology can also be found throughout the aircraft’s avionics system, covering navigation, flight controls, electrical systems and utilities such as door management systems.

Air Malta wet-leases airbus to Sky Airline of Chile - Times of Malta,"Tue, 10 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZm1hbHRhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy92aWV3L2Fpci1tYWx0YS13ZXQtbGVhc2VzLWFpcmJ1cy10by1za3ktYWlybGluZS1vZi1jaGlsZS40OTgzOTjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An Air Malta’s plane will be flying over South America this winter thanks to another wet-lease agreement signed with Chile’s Sky Airline.

Through a wet-lease agreement, an airline leases an aircraft and flight crew to another airline.

Air Malta is providing an Airbus A320 aircraft to Sky Airline of Chile for a period of three months.

This is the sixth wet lease agreement between both airlines since 2007. Through such agreements Air Malta generates additional revenue and leases out its excess capacity during winter.

Previous Air Malta customers included Etihad Airways, Libyan Airlines, Adria Airways and Air New Zealand.

As in previous years, the aircraft (registration 9H-AEF) will be operated by Air Malta cockpit crew and maintained by Air Malta’s engineers. A number of Maltese training in-flight Managers have also been sent over to Chile to give the necessary training to Sky Airline’s cabin crew.

The pilots deployed with this aircraft have been given specialised training to be able to operate the aircraft in South America and across the Andes mountains. These types of leases also create continued opportunities for Air Malta employees to work abroad and garner further experience in their professional careers.

Sky is a Chilean airline providing passenger, mail and cargo air transportation services since 2001. Originally it started operating in the Caribbean but in June 2002, the airline moved to Chile flying from its base in Santiago to main cities in the region.

Air Malta is also currently marketing another aircraft for dry lease after the current lease expires as at the end of March 2014 and in line with the current restructuring plan.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999591112136841}",neutral,0.9999591112136841,0
Aircraft pioneer honoured in Airbus HQ opening - Gazette Series,"Sat, 07 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhemV0dGVzZXJpZXMuY28udWsvbmV3cy8xMDg2MjgxMy5haXJjcmFmdC1waW9uZWVyLWhvbm91cmVkLWluLWFpcmJ1cy1ocS1vcGVuaW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The building has been called Barnwell House to honour the Bristol Aeroplane Company pioneer, who lived in Alveston and was renowned for aircraft such as the Bristol Scout, the Bristol Fighter, Bristol Bulldog and the Blenheim Bomber.

He was regarded as one of the UK's greatest aeronautical engineers but was tragically killed in a flying accident.

Barnwell House is part of the multi-million pound Airbus Aerospace Park development , a major investment at Filton, where some 4,000 employees are based.

It was opened by Fabrice Bregier, the president and chief executive officer of Airbus, who was joined by Martin Donnelly, Permanent Secretary for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.

Mr Bregier said: “The importance of the Filton site to Airbus and to aerospace in general cannot be overstated. The expertise and skills here are world class and play a pivotal role in developing new technologies for the future of aviation.

“Airbus Aerospace Park represents a major investment by the company. Filton has always been a site of great historical interest for aviators, but today marks the start of a new and exciting chapter which I know will be just as historic.”

Mark Stewart, general manager and human resources director for Airbus in the UK, said: “Our investment in these state-of-the-art facilities underlines our commitment to the future of the Filton site and will help sustain jobs directly as well as in the extended supply chain.""

He said Filton was recognised as a global centre for engineering and design, which was why Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced the creation of the Aerospace Technology Institute during a visit to the site earlier this year.

About 2,400 staff - mostly engineers working on wing design and associated systems - will be based in Barnwell House.

The opening of the building comes after the refurbishment of historic Pegasus House, which was recently opened by the Duke of Gloucester and Tom Williams, the Airbus Executive Vice President of programmes.

Captain Barnwell was born in Scotland in 1880 and with his brother, Harold, became famous for building and flying the first powered aeroplane in Scotland in 1909.

Two years later he accepted a position from Sir George White, founder of the Bristol Aeroplane Company, to work at Filton and went on to become one of Britain's most celebrated aeronautical engineers and designers.

After the First World War he took his family to Australia but a couple of years later returned to Filton as chief designer and set up home in what is now the Alveston House Hotel.

He died in 1938 while flying a plane he had designed for his own use and is buried in Alveston's churchyard. He left his widow, Marjorie, and their three sons but in another tragedy, all the sons died while serving as RAF pilots in the Second World War.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999958276748657}",neutral,0.9999958276748657,0

Designed specifically for Gulf Air by integrating features based on feedback from customers, it is the only A320-ER aircraft in the world featuring fully flat-bed seats, Gulf Air has said in a statement. At the press of a button, the new Falcon Gold seat converts into a fully flat-bed measuring 1.90m in length.

The new A320-ER features a total of 110 seats in a two-class configuration of 14 Falcon Gold class and 96 Economy seats.

The Falcon Gold seats offer more personal space between seats than the airline’s previous business class product, allowing passengers to sit back and relax in a 22-inch wide armchair that converts easily into the passenger’s desired position, according to the statement.

While armrests are fully adjustable to different heights, there is significant storage space such as a shoe packing pocket and a side compartment specifically designed for laptops. A massage at 30,000ft is now a reality with an in-seat massage facility, the statement adds.

The Falcon Gold seats come with complete audio-video-on-demand features, an individual 15-inch touch screen in every seat and high-quality noise-cancelling headphones. A suite of movies, video and audio titles in several languages are available in addition to games. A USB port is available in every seat to allow passengers to easily charge electronic devices during the flight.

The Economy class seats feature a 4-inch recline, an 18-inch seat width and an adjustable head and foot rest. The seats are fitted with 9-inch seatback TV monitors for enjoying the in-flight entertainment options.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999916553497314}",neutral,0.9999916553497314,0

A terrified airline pilot ducked to avoid a UFO he feared was going to smash into his plane at 34,000ft.

The captain of the packed Airbus A320 spotted the silver object heading straight for the cockpit as his plane flew above Berkshire.

He was looking out of the left window a split second before the bizarre incident.

A safety report said: “As he turned to look ahead, he perceived an object travelling towards them at what appeared to be the same level, slightly above the flight deck windscreen.

“Having very little time to focus, he was under the apprehension that they were on a collision course with no time to react.

“His immediate reaction was to duck to the right and reach over to alert the first officer; there was no time to talk to alert him.”

The stunned captain blurted out: “Did you see that?”

But his bemused deputy had not seen the UFO and replied: “See what?”

The pilot’s behaviour made him fear there was a fault with their plane.

“The first officer turned and looked at him thinking some was wrong with the aircraft,” the report revealed.

The captain was so spooked by the incident in July that he reported the sighting to safety watchdogs at the UK Airprox Board , which investigates near-misses in British airspace.

He told experts he saw a flying object shaped like a cigar or rugby ball, which was “bright silver, metallic”.

The “near-miss” happened 20 miles west of Heathrow Airport, according to a report published last week.

An official probe said: “The pilot was subjected to a powerful impression of immediate danger caused by his perception of an object closing rapidly on his aircraft.”

But investigators, who did not reveal which airline was involved, failed to find any unidentified aircraft in the area at the time.

They added: “It wasn’t possible to trace the object or determine the likely cause of the sighting.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.991068959236145}",neutral,0.991068959236145,0

The 292-seat Airbus A340-600 aircraft will seat 12 passengers in Diamond First Class, 32 in Pearl Business Class and 248 in Coral Economy.

New mid-afternoon services to Mumbai and New Delhi on Airbus A320s, each seating 136 passengers, have also been introduced as the Abu Dhabi carrier ups capacity amid strengthening demand.

The Abu Dhabi-Delhi evening service has also been upgraded to a 254-seat Airbus A330-200 aircraft, with 18 business class and 236 economy class seats. The expanded schedules come into immediate effect.

The new Etihad flights will also be marketed by Jet Airways as an extension of the airlines’ existing codeshare partnership.

President and chief executive officer of Etihad Airways, James Hogan, said these increases enable the airline to not only serve local traffic demands but also deliver much greater international connectivity for business and leisure travellers.

“Travellers from India will have more opportunities to connect with flights to destinations including Abu Dhabi, the GCC, Middle East, Africa, Europe and North America, while those flying to India will benefit from additional seats and more schedule options, providing greater travel flexibility,” he said.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9973828196525574}",positive,0.9973828196525574,1
New aircraft to improve Air Namibia's bottom line - New Era,"Thu, 19 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3ZXJhbGl2ZS5uYS9wb3N0cy9haXJjcmFmdC1pbXByb3ZlLWFpci1uYW1pYmlhcy1ib3R0b20tbGluZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Namibia yesterday bid farewell to its two old Airbus A340-300 aircraft, which were used on its long haul flights between Windhoek and Frankfurt for the past seven years. The two aircraft have been replaced by the newer Airbus A330-200, which offers 20 percent lower costs compared to the old aircraft and are expected to increase the airline’s overall operational efficiency by about 30 percent. “Currently Air Namibia has an average fleet age of six years, making Air Namibia one of the airlines with the youngest fleet on the continent. The benefits of operating newer generation aircraft are visible and we have started reaping the fruits, with lower cost and high technical dispatch reliability among others,” said the airline’s Chief Operating Officer, Rene Gsponer. The newer aircraft, which are already in operation, are also expected to provide significant benefits to the national airline including burning less fuel and producing less carbon emissions and will result in lower maintenance costs. The newer Airbus aircraft also have lower maximum takeoff weight of 230 000kg, compared to the 257 000kg of the older aircraft. The newer aircraft also has less seats, at 244, compared to 278 seats of the older aircraft. Gsponer added that due to added features of the new aircraft, Air Namibia will actually generate more revenue per flight even though the number of passengers carried will be less. Other features of the A330-200 include state-of-the-art equipment for comfort and in-flight entertainment. “Most of our passengers who have had the opportunity to experience our new fleet range can testify and confirm the improvements,” commented Paul Nakawa, Head of Air Namibia’s Corporate Communications. Air Namibia’s fleet of Airbus aircraft was first availed in 2006 with the introduction of two A340-300 aircraft leased from BCI. These aircraft are four-engine aircraft and were configured to suit the market demand at the time. Throughout the lease period the aircraft were maintained by Lufthansa Techniks in Germany as part of the lease agreement. “We are hitting a very high service level now and can confidently say that we have achieved a 93 percent on-time departure for the last three months. Personally, I think we can improve on this figure by one or two percent,” added Gsponer. He also said that Air Namibia currently has the lowest insurance premium of any African air operator due to the excellent safety record at the airline.

The magnificent Airbus ACJ319 - Luxatic,"Fri, 20 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vbHV4YXRpYy5jb20vdGhlLW1hZ25pZmljZW50LWFpcmJ1cy1hY2ozMTkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boasting large bank accounts doesn’t at all cope with the conventional, so any chance of exclusivity is carefully checked out. This is the case for travelling – it’s quite an odd thing to see a billionaire travel from point A to point B with regular class flights and it’s now a bit strange to see them travel even with the business class. For such people, Airbus comes with a solution – their brand new private jet Airbus ACJ319.

A luxurious breed, this plane is a business class jet fitted with a residence-like space and top notch office, currently being operated by VVIP charter brand Comlux. Furthermore, in order to provide travelers with a high degree of comfort, the aircraft also comprises lounge areas, bedrooms, bathrooms and all sorts of work spaces throughout. The main lounge, for example, boasts with seats and couches that are upholstered in cream leather alongside gorgeous soft pile beige carpeting. This gorgeous décor is completed by wood grain polished tables, a huge dining table, a massive wall-mounted flat TV and small lamps adorned with red roses.

The private bedroom on the other hand boasts a double bed consisting of scrumptious quilt, an additional wall-mounted television and a sofa for three. This room also encompasses a private study for the business work the owner has to carry on. A large shower and sparkling gold taps garnish the bathroom, which is quite exquisite in its own way. Don’t think for one second that these settings are default and fix. The owner is able to convert everything, everywhere inside the Airbus ACJ319 according to his tastes.

An interesting characteristic of this Airbus is the fact that the ACJ319 is one of the largest private jets one can find on the market, with a cabin height that reaches 2.25 meters and 3.7 meters in width. No wonder it aims towards corporations, governments or billionaires. Above all, it is currently open for checkups at the Avalon Air Show this week, in Australia. The price is quite astounding though, but it deserves it – a mind-boggling $87 million.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999980926513672}",neutral,0.9999980926513672,0
