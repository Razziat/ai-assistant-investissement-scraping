"Power-to-Liquids, explained - Airbus","Thu, 15 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA3LXBvd2VyLXRvLWxpcXVpZHMtZXhwbGFpbmVk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"T

oday, the large-scale deployment of renewable energy is accelerating, as the world looks to increasingly decarbonise its energy mix. And a share of this renewable energy is expected to open up new possibilities, such as the conversion of renewable electricity into liquid fuels. Known as Power-to-Liquid (PtL), this type of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is emerging as an exciting option to fuel future aircraft.

In 1923, chemists Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch decided to take a novel approach to converting coal into a new synthetic fuel – a process originally developed in Germany in 1913. Together, they tested an indirect way to liquefy coal in which solid coal is first transformed into a gas. The process involves introducing metal catalysts at temperatures of 150–300°C (302–572 °F) to set off a variety of chemical reactions resulting in liquid hydrocarbons – or a raw liquid form of carbon monoxide blended with hydrogen or water gas.

The process was such a success that coal-rich Germany used it during World War II to produce a replacement fuel for traditional fossil-based petroleum. In fact, 92% of Germany's air fuel and over 50% of its petroleum supply in the 1940s was created using the coal liquefaction process pioneered by Fischer and Tropsch.

A century later, the Fischer-Tropsch process is one of the main ASTM-approved methods for producing SAF. Today, this type of SAF is known as PtL, and it boasts improved combustion properties that could help significantly reduce emissions across a variety of sectors, including aviation.

One of the major advantages of PtL is that it can be transported and distributed via the existing network of fossil-fuel infrastructure, including pipelines and filling stations.

What is Power-to-Liquid or PtL?

PtL is a synthetically produced liquid hydrocarbon. Renewable electricity is the key energy source, and water and carbon dioxide (CO₂) are the main resources used in PtL production, which consists of three main steps:

Renewable energy powers electrolysers to produce green hydrogen.

Climate-neutral CO₂ – captured via, for example, Direct Air Carbon Capture – is converted into carbon feedstock.

Carbon feedstocks are synthesised with green hydrogen – via processes such as Fischer-Tropsch – to generate liquid hydrocarbons. They are then converted to produce a synthetic equivalent to kerosene.

Power To Liquids For Aviation Infographic<br /> English version

Capturing and storing CO₂ are central to the production of PtL. Indeed, recapturing the CO₂ released during combustion and combining it with hydrogen closes the loop in that the CO₂ that was initially released is reused to create fuel. For this reason, PtL’s “well-to-wheel” emissions – an important measurement that compares the efficiency of different solutions in relation to greenhouse gas emissions – can be reduced by as much as 90% compared to fossil fuels.

One of the major advantages of PtL is that it can be transported and distributed via the existing network of fossil-fuel infrastructure, including pipelines and filling stations. In addition, blending PtL with conventional kerosene (up to 50%) is already possible, according to current jet fuel standards.

However, today’s PtL is currently produced at a relatively high cost and on a low scale. This is expected to change as the green hydrogen ecosystem continues to ramp up worldwide. Experts predict that PtL could be ready to use on a wider scale between 2025 and 2030.

Partnering to develop PtL at a large scale

PtL is an alternative fuel that is JetA/JetA1-approved. It offers the required energy density, a prerequisite for fuelling transport modes that require a high power demand to travel long distances. This makes PtL an interesting solution to fuel aviation – and Airbus is taking notice.

In fact, Airbus sees PtL as having huge potential, not only in terms of climate impact, but also in cost and scalability. This is why Airbus is partnering with the SAF+ Consortium, the first organisation in North America to target wide-scale PtL production.

The objective of the partnership is to provide Canada – and eventually the rest of North America – with a sustainable supply of PtL to enable low-carbon flying. The demonstration plant, located near Montréal, will start production in 2021, with large-scale industrial production expected by 2025.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6752923130989075}",neutral,0.6752923130989075,0

Airbus touts H175M for possible RAF Puma replacement contest - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLXRvdXRzLWgxNzVtLW5taC1yYWYtcHVtYS1yZXBsYWNlbWVudC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters U.K. says it expects a military variant of its popular H175 to be an ideal candidate for the emerging U.K. New Medium Helicopter (NMH) requirement.

Airbus said its H175M is “an advanced, high-performing helicopter fully capable of fulfilling the U.K.’s NMH needs and of becoming a sustainable U.K. export product.” Airbus Photo

The process to replace the Royal Air Force’s fleet of Puma HC2s and up to three other types by 2025 has yet to be formally launched, although it is expected to facilitate a rationalization within the U.K. Ministry of Defence’s (MoD’s) rotary-wing fleets. The U.K. Integrated Review’s Defence Command Paper, issued by the MoD on March 22, 2021, laid out plans for a new medium-lift helicopter in the mid-2020s that will enable a consolidation of the disparate fleet of medium-lift helicopters from four platform types to one — with the central pillar being the replacement of the Puma.

As of yet there have been no specifications issued by the U.K. MoD, and Airbus told Vertical that it is possible that an alternative model from its military range could be appropriate, but right now the H175M appears the most suitable. In service since 2015, the commercial H175 is currently operating in a number of roles including search-and-rescue and law enforcement. Airbus has a strong track record of developing types in both civilian and military versions, such as the H145 light twin helicopter. It said the 8-tonne-class military H175M could readily be offered with a typical array of military equipment, with a baseline capability to accommodate 12 troop seats.

The company acknowledged that the civil H175 includes significant Chinese manufacturing input, but it has now built an H175 airframe fully in Europe. The company said it has been produced entirely free of any elements sourced from China as the result of a project that has been under way for the past five years capitalizing on European aerostructures capability. Airbus Helicopters said this specific example could be the first H175M to be delivered to the U.K. Ministry of Defence if selected.

Airbus has rejected claims that the H175M is “too Chinese” for NMH requirements. Airbus Photo

Leonardo Helicopters has already said it intends to offer its AW149 for the NMH requirement, and a competition could see the two rotary-wing manufacturers going head-to-head, although in recent times the U.K. has often opted for a sole-source acquisition based on a specific set of requirements and capabilities. Meanwhile, Bell told Vertical: “Our teams are in constant contact with the U.K. acquisition authority as the United Kingdom continues to define their New Medium Helicopter (NMH) requirements. Bell remains committed to providing the right solution based on those requirements and we are certain our aircraft offer the most capable and versatile performance options.”

Bell added that its medium 412EPX is an ideal aircraft with “superior payload and range performance.” The Lockheed Martin/Sikorsky S-70i Black Hawk, built in Poland, is a popular option within military circles and is another potential candidate to be offered for NMH.

In keeping with the British Government’s prosperity agenda, Airbus Helicopters U.K. said it would establish a final assembly line for the H175M in the U.K., if it was selected for the NMH requirement, and that it would also export this model globally from the U.K. The company — which has already secured extensive ties with the MoD through its support for the Military Flying Training System and H135 Juno and H145 Jupiter at RAF Shawbury — is clearly hoping for the chance to enter into a competition for the NMH requirement.

Airbus Helicopters in the U.K. managing director Colin James told Vertical: “Contrary to the misleading implications from our competitor, the H175M is, as you can see, most certainly not a ‘paper aircraft.’ We have built the first airframe using a supply base completely compliant with Western military requirements and we have identified multiple supplier sources who can provide the last two components of the complete helicopter which need to be replaced.

“The H175M is an advanced, high-performing helicopter fully capable of fulfilling the U.K.’s NMH needs and of becoming a sustainable U.K. export product with the potential to resurrect the capacity and capability of the country’s helicopter industry. The civil variant is by far the most capable super medium aircraft on the market, with 26 aircraft already in daily North Sea operations off the coast of the U.K.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999364614486694}",neutral,0.9999364614486694,0

HOTR: Boeing's backlog market share vs Airbus falls below 40% - Leeham News and Analysis,"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8xNC9ob3RyLWJvZWluZ3MtYmFja2xvZy1tYXJrZXQtc2hhcmUtdnMtYWlyYnVzLWZhbGxzLWJlbG93LTQwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By the Leeham News Team

July 14, 2021, © Leeham News: Six months into 2021, Boeing is delivering 737 MAXes, clearing MAX inventory, and taking orders.

Airbus isn’t matching Boeing orders for the A320 family, so far. But as the industry struggles to return to normal, it’s worth taking a six month look at how Airbus and Boeing compare.

In terms of total backlog, Airbus has a 62% market share vs. Boeing’s 38% share.

This includes all single- and twin-aisle aircraft. It also includes freighters—a Boeing exclusive right now—and air force tankers, where Boeing also has an advantage.

Airbus has a 65% share of the single-aisle backlog vs Boeing’s 35% share. Airbus includes the A220 and A320 families.

Boeing has a slim lead in the wide-body sector, boosted by its exclusive backlog in freighters and the larger backlog for the KC-46A tanker vs the A330 MRTT: 52% to 48%.

Boeing’s backlog is adjusted for the accounting rule ASC 606, which eliminates orders no longer considered firm but which aren’t canceled. Airbus doesn’t publish the European equivalent of iffy orders, so the market share is somewhat skewed. Regardless, it isn’t an encouraging picture for Boeing.

A reversal for Boeing

Thirty years ago, Boeing held a 60% market share over its competitors, McDonnell Douglas, and Airbus. Today, there is no McDonnell Douglas and Airbus has the 60%+ lead over Boeing.

The reversal of fortune for Boeing is stunning when one thinks about it. And the slide long pre-dates the 737 MAX crisis, which hasn’t helped Boeing’s position in the market.

Boeing CEO David Calhoun says he can’t make up lost ground that’s tied to the MAX grounding. He hopes to return to parity going forward, though.

But Boeing lost market share to Airbus before the grounding. The A321neo, especially the LR and XLR models, provided a boost to Airbus that Boeing can’t match with the 737-9 or 737-10.

A new airplane that offers a step change is needed for Boeing. Simply reinventing a 757 won’t bring Boeing’s glory days back.

FlyDubai cancels 65 737 MAXes

FlyDubai, the low cost carrier that has a close relationship with Emirates Airline, canceled 65 orders for the Boeing 737 MAX last month.

Boeing recorded, as expected, the order for 200 737 MAXes from United Airlines in June 2021. However, the OEM also recorded the cancellation of 65 737 MAXes from flyDubai. The below table details Boeing’s gross orders during June 2021:

ICBC and Jackson square effectively took over five orders from BOC Aviation during the month.

Boeing increased its tally of ASC 606 orders on the 737 program from 723 to 772 (an increase of 49) and from 48 to 55 on the 787 program.

The global helicopter fleet with Helionix avionics logs 500000+ flight hours - Airbus,"Fri, 02 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA3LXRoZS1nbG9iYWwtaGVsaWNvcHRlci1mbGVldC13aXRoLWhlbGlvbml4LWF2aW9uaWNzLWxvZ3MtNTAwMDAwLWZsaWdodC1ob3Vyc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Underscoring its growing popularity with operators worldwide, Airbus Helicopters’ Helionix avionics suite now equips more than 500 H135, H145, H160, and H175 rotorcraft around the world – with over half a million flight hours logged to date by this fleet.

Airbus continues to enhance the capabilities of Helionix with new features, functionality, and connectivity – as well as adaptations that are specific to the various versions in Airbus Helicopters’ rotorcraft family.

The pilot’s best friend

As the state-of-the art avionics solution developed in-house by Airbus Helicopters, Helionix provides greater operational safety and mission flexibility in an intuitive, pilot-friendly cockpit environment.

It offers an innovative cockpit layout with two-to-four multi-function screens designed to improve pilots’ situational awareness. In particular, the system displays only the most pertinent details of a flight phase – filtering out all unnecessary and distracting information, according to Christian Gottschalk, Head of the Helionix programme at Airbus Helicopters.

Completing the avionics suite are a GPS navigation/communication system and traffic advisory notification, along with a mission system incorporating a digital map, terrain avoidance capabilities and synthetic vision cockpit technology. Further contributing to a reduction of the pilot’s workload and enhanced safety is the Helionix four-axis autopilot.

Helionix also lowers helicopter maintenance costs by monitoring more than a thousand parameters in real time – allowing operators to monitor system trends and anticipate unscheduled maintenance operations.

Airbus’ Helionix avionics suite filters out unnecessary and distracting information so pilots can focus on the most pertinent details.<br /> Helionix is an avionics system designed by Airbus Helicopters to offer increased mission flexibility to operators.

Constant evolution

Helionix is continually evolved with each new version, taking customers’ requests and feedback into account. This includes bolstering search and rescue (SAR) capabilities and introducing Rig’N Fly automatic mode approaches for landings on oil platforms. Other flight monitoring and failure management functions have recently been developed as well.

Following an agreement with the heli-offshore community to implement new helicopter terrain awareness and warning system (HTAWS) modes, a Vortex protection has been introduced as well – protecting the rotorcraft against loss of airspeed. Incorporated into the autopilot, this new mode can be integrated in all helicopters flying with Helionix.

New configurations and capabilities

Airbus recently certified a new single-pilot, IFR-compatible (instrument flight rules) cockpit version of Helionix for its H135 rotorcraft – giving customers an option to remove the co-pilot side of the instrument panel to increase the field of view, or retain it in order to install specific equipment.

For the H135, the planned single-pilot IFR cockpit will further boost this helicopter’s capabilities across multiple applications – including aerial work, utility missions and law enforcement.

In addition, a new wireless airborne communications system deployed on the H145 enhances connectivity by securely transmitting helicopter data in real time.

Airbus joins Canada's SAF+ Consortium to accelerate the development of a new Sustainable Aviation Fuel technology - Airbus,"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0wNy1haXJidXMtam9pbnMtY2FuYWRhcy1zYWYtY29uc29ydGl1bS10by1hY2NlbGVyYXRlLXRoZS1kZXZlbG9wbWVudNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 15th July 2021 - Airbus and the Montreal, Canada-based SAF+ Consortium have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to collaborate with major Canadian aviation industry players on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) development and production in North America. Airbus will be investing through “in-kind” contributions, which consist of technical and certification expertise, economic analysis, communications and advocacy.

Today’s announcement marks the launch of a new Canadian ecosystem dedicated to stimulating the production of SAF and connecting Airbus with prominent Canadian actors spanning the entire aviation value chain to develop a concrete solution that will make low-carbon flying a reality.

The aviation sector is a global industry and while momentum for SAF is growing, particularly in Europe, investment in SAF’s worldwide development is of equal importance to enable the entire sector to achieve significant CO2 emissions reductions around the globe.

“Airbus, alongside many of its customers, is more than convinced the use of SAF is an essential pillar to support the aviation industry’s decarbonisation journey,” says Steven Le Moing, Airbus New Energy Programme Manager. “Building this new Canadian ecosystem alongside the SAF+ Consortium is a key milestone as we continue to push to reach our global 2050 CO2 emissions-reduction targets. This partnership is a perfect example of how Airbus is actively shaping decarbonisation discussions in North America, while demonstrating our commitment to making SAF an economically viable solution available to our customers.”

“SAF+ aims to be a pioneer in the field of SAF, and with the support of visionary partners such as Airbus, we will create a competitive company, able to offer one of the many technological solutions needed to decarbonise the aviation industry,” says Jean Paquin, President and CEO of the SAF+ Consortium.

The SAF+ Consortium brings together a number of key Quebec-based aerospace companies and research institutions, such as Air Transat, Hydro-Quebec, Aéroports de Montréal, Polytechnique Montréal and Aéro Montréal.

The SAF+ Consortium’s goal is to transform Montreal into a sustainable aviation hub in North America through the construction and subsequent operation of a pilot SAF production plant. Situated close to Montreal, this pilot plant will produce a type of SAF known as Power-to-Liquid (PtL), which is an e-fuel consisting of captured carbon dioxide (CO2) synthesised with renewable (green) hydrogen. The process involves capturing CO2 from large industrial emitters and converting it into an alternative fuel. It is estimated that the fuel produced by SAF+ will have an 80% lower carbon footprint compared to conventional jet fuel. The Consortium builds on Air Transat's commitment to purchase a significant portion of the future SAF produced at the plant for its all-Airbus fleet.

SAF+ intends to produce SAF as early as the second half of 2021 at its first pilot plant. A commercial project of 30 million liters is planned for 2025.

The A350-900 aircraft was delivered to China Eastern Airlines, the largest Airbus operator in Asia and second largest in the world. At the end of June 2021, China Eastern Airlines operated an Airbus fleet of 413 aircraft, including 349 A320 Family aircraft, 55 A330 Family aircraft and nine A350 aircraft.



“I’m proud that Airbus successfully extended the capability of the widebody C&DC in Tianjin to the A350, the latest new generation aircraft, at such a difficult time of global aviation,” said George Xu, Airbus Executive Vice President and Airbus China CEO. “This is a new milestone in the long-term cooperation between China and Airbus, which further demonstrates Airbus’ commitment to the country. Congratulations to China Eastern Airlines, our long-term strategic partner, for receiving the first A350 delivered from China, and I appreciate their trust in Airbus and in our products as always.”



Located at the same site as the Airbus Tianjin A320 Family Final Assembly Line and the Airbus Tianjin Delivery Centre, the widebody C&DC covers the aircraft completion activities, including cabin installation, aircraft painting and production flight test, as well as customer flight acceptance and aircraft delivery.



The centre was inaugurated in September 2017 with its capability on A330s. Then, during the visit of French President Emmanuel Macron to China in 2019, a Memorandum of Understanding on the Further Development of Industrial Cooperation was signed in Beijing by He Lifeng, Chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) of China, and Guillaume Faury, Airbus Chief Executive Officer, announcing the C&DC would extend its capability to A350 aircraft.



The A350 features the latest aerodynamic design, a carbon-fibre fuselage and wings, plus new fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce engines. Together, these features translate into unrivalled levels of operational efficiency with a 25 per cent reduction in fuel burn and CO 2 emissions. The A350’s ‘Airspace by Airbus’ cabin is the quietest of any widebody aircraft and offers passengers and crews the most modern in-flight products for the most comfortable flying experience.



At the end of June 2021, the A350 Family had received 915 firm orders from 49 customers worldwide, making it one of the most successful widebody aircraft ever.

Around 150 payload separation systems supplied by Airbus in Spain with 100% success rate

Madrid, 27 July, 2021 - After a successful delivery review meeting (DRB-Delivery Review Board) with the Italian customer AVIO, Airbus Defence and Space is finalising preparations for shipment of the dispenser for the French reconnaissance satellite mission CERES to the Kourou launch base. This structure maintains the three CERES satellites in the VEGA launcher and releases them once they have reached the desired orbital position. The launch is scheduled for mid-October this year from the European spaceport in French Guiana.



Dispensers are structures that facilitate the launch of two or more satellites into orbit in a single launch.

Weighing just 200kg, the specially adapted CLIP dispenser, will carry the three 500kg satellites. The carbon fibre composite structure is based on a truncated cone with a height of 1.46m and a three-winged upper platform with gussets to install the satellites. Its lightweight design optimises the use of the available volume inside the launcher fairing. Each satellite is anchored with four hold-down and release systems that are actuated at precisely the right moment to inject the satellites into orbit.

The Airbus site in Madrid-Barajas is specialised in the manufacture of these types of structures with substantial experience in separation systems and carbon fibre technology. Separation systems are critical elements that cannot incorporate redundancy; they are single point failure elements and must work once activated. The success of the mission depends on their correct operation. To date, around 150 payload separation systems have been supplied by Airbus in Spain with a 100% success rate.

CERES is the first fully-fledged Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) space system in Europe. The CERES contract was awarded by DGA (Direction Générale de l'Armement), together with CNES (French National Centre for Space Studies), to Airbus Defence and Space as prime contractor. CERES will provide the French armed forces with a high performance end-to-end operational system, including a User Ground Segment, a Ground Control Segment and three identical, simultaneously-launched satellites. CERES builds on the achievements of the early technological programmes ESSAIM and ELISA, also primed by Airbus.

Airbus completes integration of 3rd Copernicus Sentinel-2 - Airbus,"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0wNy1haXJidXMtY29tcGxldGVzLWludGVncmF0aW9uLW9mLTNyZC1jb3Blcm5pY3VzLXNlbnRpbmVsLTLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Climate satellite will now undergo extensive testing

Friedrichshafen, 29 July 2021 – Airbus has finished the integration of the Copernicus Sentinel-2C satellite. It is the third of its kind and will now be shipped to Munich to undergo extensive environmental tests to prove its readiness for space. The test campaign will last until March 2022.



The data gathered by Sentinel-2 satellites are used for monitoring land use and changes, soil sealing, land management, agriculture, forestry, natural disasters (floods, forest fires, landslides and erosion) and to assist humanitarian aid missions. Environmental observation in coastal areas likewise forms part of these activities, as does glacier, ice and snow monitoring.

Offering ""colour vision"" for the Copernicus programme, Sentinel-2C – like its precursor satellites Sentinel-2A and -2B – will deliver optical images from the visible to short-wave infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum. From an altitude of 786 kilometres, the 1.1 ton “C” satellite will enable continuation of imaging in 13 spectral bands with a resolution of 10, 20 or 60 metres and a uniquely large swath width of 290 km.

The telescope structure and the mirrors are made of silicon carbide, first pioneered by Airbus to provide very high optical stability and minimize thermo-elastic deformation, resulting in an excellent geometric image quality. This is unprecedented in this category of optical imagers. Each Sentinel-2 satellite collects 1.5 terabytes per day, after on-board compression. The data is formatted at high speed and temporarily stored on board in the highest capacity Mass Memory and Formatting unit currently flying in space. Data recording and laser-enabled downlink can take place simultaneously at high speed via the EDRS SpaceDataHighway, in addition to the direct X-band link to the ground stations.

The Sentinel-2-mission is based on a constellation of two identical satellites, Sentinel-2A (launched 2015) and Sentinel-2B (launched 2017), flying in the same orbit but 180° apart for optimal coverage and revisit time. The satellites orbit the Earth every 100 minutes covering all Earth’s land surfaces, large islands, inland and coastal waters every five days.

The Sentinel-2 satellites are currently sensing systematically all land and water areas, producing excellent results. Last year, the Sentinel-2 mission remained the top European mission in terms of peer-reviewed scientific publications (1200 during 2020) and data volume distributed to users.

The Sentinel-2 mission has been made possible thanks to the close collaboration between ESA, the European Commission, industry, service providers and data users. Its development has involved around 60 companies, led by Airbus Defence and Space in Germany for the satellites and Airbus Defence and Space in France for the multispectral instruments, while Airbus Defence and Space in Spain is responsible for the mechanical satellite structure.

Copernicus, Europe’s environmental monitoring programme, is led by the European Commission (EC) in partnership with the European Space Agency (ESA). The Copernicus Sentinels supply remote sensing data of the Earth, delivering key operational services related to environment and security.

The YouTuber, best known for building aircraft models out of Lego, has successfully constructed a detailed replica of the world’s biggest passenger plane out of 40,000 separate pieces.

The custom design is a miniature version of an Emirates Airbus A380. Better known as the “Superjumbo,” the actual A380 features more than 4 million parts sourced from 30 countries across the globe. This build is on a much smaller scale, roughly 1:40, but impressive nonetheless.

BigPlanes spent countless hours on the project without using any instructions, glue or metal support beams. Tipping the scales at around 90 pounds, the finished model measures 6 feet from tip to tail and has a wingspan of 7 feet. For context, its real-life twin spans 239 feet in length with a wingspan of 262 feet.

As for propulsion, the plane is equipped with four engines that each house one of Lego’s “power functions” motors. While this setup certainly looks the part, don’t expect the g-force of a Superjumbo. It packs a quartet of either the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 or the Engine Alliance GP7000 turbofan engines that can propel the aircraft to 737 mph at full tilt.

The real pièce de résistance is the interior, which can be viewed through the modular removable roof. BigPlanes managed to showcase the different cabins and suites as well as a kitted-out Emirates crew and an eclectic mix of passengers. (The dapper gent with a top hat and cane is our personal favorite.) There’s even in-flight food and beverages, including a giant roast chicken and wine.

The Emirates A380, in particular, is renowned the world over for its luxurious onboard lounge that is available exclusively to first- and business-class passengers. This space has been artfully depicted at around the 7:50-minute mark in the video and features a bar where Lego versions of the upper crust can be seen imbibing.

Needless to say, BigPlanes has knocked it out of the park with his take on this big Emirates plane.

The cell’s connector is then attached and welded, followed by the finished unit’s insertion into a magazine. And the entire process starts again.

Sirius and 17 robot “colleagues” (all named after stars in the Milky Way) form the heart of Europe’s very first fully automated solar-array production facility, which began operations this month. Solar arrays are used on satellites and spacecraft to provide power that is converted from sunlight.

Investing in the future

Airbus has invested more than €15 million in the facility, with this new Industry 4.0 production line serving as a flagship project for the company’s industrial strategy. “Sirius never gets tired and doesn’t make any mistakes,” says Sirius’ manager Jens Birkel, who is in charge of solar array production and test at Airbus in Ottobrunn.

From an individual cell to a completed solar array, the robots carry out a total of 60 steps across six stations. After Sirius has fed the individual solar cells into the production line, “Vega” laminates the cells with a glass covering to protect them against cosmic radiation in space.

“Sirius never gets tired and doesn’t make any mistakes.”

Jens Birkel, Head of Solar Array Engineering

Airbus fully automates solar array production

“Capella” then welds diodes to the solar cells, before “Bellatrix” connects them together into strings, as the individual sections of a solar array are called. “Antarix” cleans the panels and prepares them for adhesion. Once that is complete, “Rigel” takes over and inserts the individual sections into the solar array.

“The Ottobrunn facility combines automation, robotisation, digitalisation and artificial intelligence to boost our productivity, quality and cost efficiency,” explained Andreas Vogel, Head of Engineering & Operations at Spacecraft Equipment.

The results are clear: Ottobrunn’s robots have cut lead times for solar array production in half, while costs are going down as well. “It’s also increasing our competitiveness on the global market,” Andreas added.

Working in harmony

After some initial apprehension from the human staff, Birkel says that everyone has learned to work well with the robots – with team members focussing on tasks that the machines cannot manage, such as wiring or testing the solar panels.

He explained: “The 18 robots take care of the monotonous and repetitive work, freeing up time for Airbus personnel to focus more on innovations, such as new solar-array designs or the manufacturing of customer parts – far away from the pressures of production. Sirius and the other 17 robots then put these innovations into practice.”

Moving forward, the team would like to ramp up production even further – responding to satellite constellations composed several hundred satellites that need to be expanded quickly. This would see the robots and their production line opening up a new market for Airbus, as well as confirming Ottobrunn’s status as a solar array centre of expertise.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999779462814331}",neutral,0.9999779462814331,0

Two A400M airlifters and two A330 Multi Role Tanker Transports from the French Air and Space Force’s inventory were involved in the June-July mission, which validated the country’s ability to protect its citizens and the farthest territories. This showed how a French force projection could reach Polynesia in less than 48 hours, with sustained air operations performed on arrival.

As part of the mission, the A330 MRTTs supported French front-line combat aircraft with seven en-route air-to-air refuellings, while the A400Ms carried approximately 30 tonnes of equipment and cargo.

Airbus’ Services teams based in France at the air bases of Orléans (home to the A400Ms) and Istres (for A330 MRTTs) were involved throughout the deployment. “We provided end-to-end support to these operations,” underlined François Winterhalter, the Airbus Head of Services Centres France. This covered the scope from on-aircraft and management systems maintenance to spares provision, quality control and post-flight analysis.

Working together with the French Armed Forces

In addition to this show of force projection, the Airbus Services teams of 120 technicians regularly work hand-in-hand with the French armed forces, preparing Airbus-built aircraft for operations that have included deployments to Mali in West Africa, for medical assistance in the Pacific related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to ensure 24/7 deterrence for France and its territories.

France introduced the A330 MRTTs in 2018, with the goal of progressively replacing older assets with the objective of having a modern, multi-role fleet composed of a single aircraft type. Capable of “topping off” two combat aircraft simultaneously while airborne, the A330 MRTT carries up to 110 metric tonnes of fuel. When fitted with the “Morphée” patient resuscitation module in its cabin, the French A330 MRTTs offer a unique medical evacuation capacity that was first utilised in 2020 during the transfer of COVID-19 patients.

The A400Ms serve as the cornerstone of the French Air and Space Force’s transport fleet, bringing superior capabilities in terms of speed, range and payload – which enable all equipment operated by the country’s armed forces to be transported directly from metropolitan France to theatres of operation. In active service since 2013, the French fleet of A400Ms will reach 25 aircraft by 2025.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9373071789741516}",positive,0.9373071789741516,1
Airbus-built European Robotic Arm ready for Space - Airbus,"Mon, 05 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0wNy1haXJidXMtYnVpbHQtZXVyb3BlYW4tcm9ib3RpYy1hcm0tcmVhZHktZm9yLXNwYWNl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Leiden, 05 July 2021 – Airbus space engineers have installed ESA’s European Robotic Arm (ERA) onto the Russian Multipurpose Laboratory Module (MLM) and it is now ready for its flight to the International Space Station (ISS). Together with this module, known as ‘Nauka’, ERA and its two control stations will launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, in Kazakhstan, on a Proton rocket.

After a one-week journey the European Robotic Arm will arrive at the ISS, where it will service the Russian segment of the space station. With a total length of 11.3 metres, the symmetrical, two-handed intelligent robot arm can 'walk' around the exterior of the ISS, hand-over-hand from one fixed base-point to another. ERA’s seven robust and accurate joints, the lightweight limbs and the control computer in the middle of the arm give the robot arm its versatility.



Astronauts and cosmonauts can control the European Robotic Arm in real-time or pre-programme it from inside or outside of the ISS, to make it move payloads, inspect the space station with its infrared cameras and to support operations outside the ISS. From its tip, the robot provides electrical power, a data bus, a video line and a rotating drive machine. By connecting a tool to the tip, ERA can be equipped for one of the many tasks it can perform automatically or semi-automatically. ERA has a lightweight construction but thanks to the zero-gravity conditions in space, it can move very large masses: from 3,000 kg routinely up to 8,000 kg in slow modus. The robot arm operates with an accuracy of 5 millimetres.



ERA has been developed for European Space Agency (ESA) by a European consortium, led by Airbus Defence and Space in the Netherlands. Airbus designed the arm and its software functions, managed the development of subsystems throughout Europe and integrated and tested the system. In the last few months Airbus has integrated ERA on the MLM, together with ESA and Russian partners RSC/Energia.



“The long awaited launch of the European Robotic Arm to the International Space Station marks a huge contribution of the Netherlands to the continued operation of the ISS, which was enabled by the loyal support of the Netherlands Space Office and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy,” said Rob Postma, Chief Executive Officer of Airbus Defence and Space Netherlands. “In addition, it celebrates the effort, commitment and determination of the many space professionals involved throughout the years.”

Artistic rendition of the EUTELSAT 36D satellite on-orbit.

Airbus will be able to offer a new UHF communications service to the armed forces, particularly those of European countries and NATO allies. As the UHF frequency band is a relatively scarce orbital resource, this offering will make up for the capacity shortage around the world. Airbus has already signed the first firm orders for this capacity, well ahead of the satellite’s scheduled launch in the first half of 2024.

The UHF payload will be operated from Airbus’s Network Operations Centre (NOC) in Toulouse. Its 18 UHF channels will enable as many as 200 simultaneous communications over Europe, the Middle East, Africa, large parts of Asia, as well as the Atlantic Ocean (to eastern Brazil) and the Indian Ocean (to western Australia).

Military UHF SATCOMs are used by the armed forces for operations on land, at sea and in the air. They have a high level of interoperability and are, therefore, very useful for multi-national and coalition operations. The UHF band is very flexible and is of particular interest to Special Forces units, as it offers a lightweight, robust and highly secure means of communication. An extensive range of terminals for use on land, at sea and in the air is available to meet the needs of the various armed forces.

Airbus notes that this new payload will enhance the firm’s portfolio throughout the lifespan of the satellite. According to the company, Airbus is the only armed forces, private, SATCOM operator to cover the full spectrum of military (UHF, X-, Ka- Mil) and commercial (L-, C-/Ku-, Ka-) frequency bands and applications.

The EUTELSAT 36D satellite will be built by Airbus based on its Eurostar Neo platform. In addition to the UHF payload and will also be equipped with 70, Ku-band transponders for TV broadcasting.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995861649513245}",neutral,0.9995861649513245,0
OneWeb is “on top of the world” after its latest launch - Airbus,"Fri, 02 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA3LW9uZXdlYi1pcy1vbi10b3Atb2YtdGhlLXdvcmxkLWFmdGVyLWl0cy1sYXRlc3QtbGF1bmNo0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"OneWeb will soon begin delivering connectivity services to the northern regions of Earth after yesterday’s eighth launch of satellite clusters for this operator’s pioneering next-generation constellation that will provide global internet access anytime, anywhere.

Bringing the total number of spacecraft in low-Earth orbit to 254, this latest deployment put the spotlight on OneWeb’s 50/50 joint venture with Airbus – called Airbus OneWeb Satellites – which has completely reimagined the satellite design and production process. Airbus OneWeb Satellites has fully industrialised it, enabling hundreds of spacecraft to be built more rapidly – at a fraction of the cost and time it traditionally takes.

As design lead, Airbus challenged every assumption, revised the status quo and reformulated what people thought was possible – and as a result, the original assembly line was set up in Toulouse France and the Airbus OneWeb Satellites’ facilities in Florida’s Merritt Island in the U.S. can now produce two spacecraft each day (while traditional manufacturing approaches require 12-18 months to produce a single satellite).

Responsible and sustainable practices were integrated into the satellite and system design right from the earliest stages, with OneWeb spacecraft built to exceed all space debris mitigation standards – a key consideration as more and more projects are sent to space in the years to come.

Trust and teamwork

Airbus OneWeb Satellites combines Airbus’ engineering and technical expertise with OneWeb’s vision and strategy for market disruption, according to Guillaume Roelly, an Airbus Defence and Space electrical test/industrialisation engineer on the constellation final assembly line. Describing the arrangement, Roelly calls it a “partnership with a great deal of trust.”

He added: “This close relationship is evident, with the two companies sharing design, production and supply chain responsibilities and tasks.”

Completing the constellation

The latest orbiting of 36 satellites – which were lofted during a night-time mission from Russia’s Vostochny Cosmodrome – positions OneWeb to fulfil its “Five to 50” goal of providing high-speed, low-latency communications solutions north of the 50th parallel by the end of 2021. This enables coverage over Northern Europe, the United Kingdom, Canada, Alaska, Greenland, Iceland, and the Arctic Seas.

Appropriately, the slogan for yesterday’s flight: “Hello North Pole!” was painted on the payload fairing of the Soyuz launcher that carried OneWeb’s satellites into space. During the Soyuz’ nearly four-hour mission, its 36 satellites were released in nine phases, to be followed by the spacecraft raising themselves to their operational orbit.

With the “Five to 50” ambition now achieved in terms of satellites orbited, Roelly said the focus is on completing the initial constellation so that OneWeb can begin delivering services worldwide in 2022.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998014569282532}",neutral,0.9998014569282532,0

Better Buy: Boeing vs. Airbus - The Motley Fool,"Sat, 03 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA3LzAzL2JldHRlci1idXktYm9laW5nLXZzLWFpcmJ1cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Comparing the investment cases for the two aviation giants.

If you are thinking of buying stock in airplane manufacturers like Airbus (EADSY -1.30%) or Boeing (BA -1.96%) at the moment, you probably assume that commercial air flights will get back to 2019 levels around the 2023 timeframe. That's how many leading industry figures see matters developing.

Given that scenario, it's likely that the demand for new airplanes will pick up, leading to higher production rates -- and ultimately higher margins and profits.

That said, which of the two leading airplane manufacturers is the better recovery play? Let's take a closer look.

Boeing vs. Airbus

On a historical basis, or at least before the 737 MAX debacle hit Boeing in 2019, Boeing has tended to generate higher margins and significantly better free cash flow (FCF) than its European rival.

That's something that might well encourage investors to favor Boeing as a recovery play. The argument is that a recovering commercial aviation market will lead to more orders and production. As production increases, so should margins, because airline manufacturers tend to reduce their unit costs of production as they build more planes -- an assumption built into financial modeling. Given that Boeing has been better than Airbus on these matters in the past, it figures that investors might favor Boeing.

Boeing and Airbus valuations

Indeed, Wall Street analysts have priced in a significant improvement in Boeing's earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin expectations. As you can see below, analysts have Boeing's margin recovering strongly by 2023.

Focusing on the 2023 timeframe, the consensus is for Boeing to generate $9.5 billion in FCF in 2023, compared to 5.1 billion euros for Airbus. These figures would put Boeing at a price-to-FCF multiple of 14.5 in 2023, and Airbus at a multiple of 16.3 times FCF. Both valuations use the current market caps.

Based on these figures, both stocks are attractive. After all, if the 2021-2023 period is the initial recovery phase leading to a resumption of Boeing and Airbus's mid-single-digit percentage revenue growth rates from the decade before the COVID-19 pandemic, https://financials.morningstar.com/ratios/r.html?t=0P00009WFE&culture=en&platform=sal then those price-to-FCF multiples look very attractive. Moreover, as commercial flights come back, airlines will start ordering again, and the narrative around the stocks will turn positive. For example, Southwest Airlines has already ordered 134 Boeing 737 MAX airplanes this year, and United Airlines recently announced its largest-ever order for 270 airplanes (200 Boeing 737 MAXs and 50 Airbus A321 NEOs).

Furthermore, given that Boeing is forecast to trade at a lower FCF multiple than Airbus in 2023, it looks like a better value.

Case closed? Buy Boeing? Unfortunately, it's not that simple.

Boeing is riskier

The case for buying Airbus over Boeing rests on the idea that there's a lot more risk to these estimates with Boeing. Analyst estimates are fine, but they are contingent on the underlying development of the businesses. And, unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has created several challenges for Boeing.

First, the 737 MAX grounding was an issue in itself, but the COVID-19 pandemic tipped the market from being a supplier's market to a buyer's market. As such, there are question marks around the kind of pricing concessions that Boeing may have to give away to sell 737 MAXs to fill production slots.

Second, Boeing's plans for a new midsize airplane (NMA) dubbed the ""797"" have been pushed back by the pandemic, and that's allowed the Airbus A321XLR to steal a lead in the marketplace for long-haul single-aisled airplanes.

Third, the general expectation is that domestic flights will return quicker than long-haul international flights, which means the narrow-body market will return earlier than the wide-body. That's a problem for Boeing, as management had previously pinned its hopes on a wide-body replacement cycle beginning at the start of this decade, being driven by its new 777X.

Boeing or Airbus?

All told, gazing into the crystal ball for 2023, the risk around Boeing is that revenue and profitability could fall short of expectations due to pricing concessions on the 737 MAX, while Boeing could find itself without a viable NMA. Also, its 777X airplane might not be profitable over the long term relative to expectations.

While these concerns don't necessarily mean you should avoid Boeing stock, given the choice the two, they are enough to make Airbus the better buy.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9991045594215393}",positive,0.9991045594215393,1

Stepping up to the plate was Boeing and EADS, the military arm of Airbus, which planned to build them at Brookley Field.

EADS and Mobile actually won that bidding contest, but Boeing protested, got another chance to bid, and then was awarded the contract.

It was a blow to Mobile until Airbus decided to change course and build a passenger jet assembly plant at Brookley, which is thriving today.

As for Boeing's contract to build what is known as the KC Tanker? Well, that didn't go so well.

""The KC Tanker has got several issues,"" says Congressman Jerry Carl of Mobile, who serves on the Armed Services Committee. Carl says, so far, the Seattle-based company has lost about $2 billion on the venture, and the planes they have produced are underperforming.

""When you've got to refuel a jet, that boom has got to be flexible,” he says. “What they've designed is not flexible. They can literally punch a hole through the jet.""

There have been rumblings recently that the whole project could be re-bid.

""I'll go on record and say we're gonna re-bid that. I will say that. That is gonna be re-bid,"" Carl said.

Carl says military decision makers are being put on the hot seat.

""We are badgering them to death. We've had every ranking military person there. We've had all but one admit it's a failed program,"" Carl said.

Carl says Airbus already has a plane that is being used by the British military that is pretty much ready to go, and the company could possibly build the KC Tanker in a partnership with Lockheed Martin. Carl says both Democrats and Republicans on the committee seem to agree on this, leading to his optimism.

""Trust me,” he says. “I'm on record. We're gonna get it.""

A stunning development coming 10 years after a bitter disappointment for Mobile.

MRO Prospects For Airbus A320 - Aviation Week,"Thu, 08 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9tcm8vYWlyY3JhZnQtcHJvcHVsc2lvbi9tcm8tcHJvc3BlY3RzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The return of domestic flying in several major markets is good news for MRO providers that maintain narrowbodies, including the Airbus A320 family.

According to the Aviation Week Intelligence Network (AWIN), as of mid-June, 5,912 A320-family aircraft were in regular commercial service, while nearly 2,900 were still parked or stored. Virtually all A320-family jets were in passenger service, with only three A320-200F freighters flying and one parked.

A320-200ceos and A321-200ceos in scheduled service dominated the flying fleet, together accounting for nearly 60% of aircraft in service. The Neo versions of these two types also dominated options and orders, with almost 80% of future deliveries.

A320-family MRO demand will increase from $15.2 billion in 2021 to $20.7 billion in 2025, and this will account for 24% of all commercial MRO demand over the next 10 years, according to the Aviation Week Commercial Fleet and MRO Forecast. The A320 and A321 Ceos will represent 70% of this demand, and A320 and A321 Neos will make up 20%.

These projections are broadly consistent with expectations of major MROs. For example, Lufthansa Technik (LHT) has so far booked A320-family maintenance at about 80% of its budgeted total for the next 12 months, and its budget volume is about 80% of pre-COVID-19 levels. “We count on a relatively strong winter season [in] 2021-22, with a return to a normal winter-summer seasonality as is usual for base maintenance,” says Marcus Motschenbacher, vice president of commercial aircraft maintenance services.

The LHT executive says A320-neos are seeing more usage and thus demanding more base maintenance, while A320ceos lag behind. Many older aircraft normally requiring heavier checks have either been removed from service entirely or are waiting for possible reactivation after being parked. An additional six-month grace period, granted by Airbus due to the pandemic, will stretch what would otherwise have been a sharp peak in demand by reactivating aircraft more evenly across the next 24 months.

But even smoothed out, the return to service poses challenges. “You need a flexible MRO with a wide network to offer a great capacity at one go,” Motschenbacher asserts. Also necessary is access to continuing airworthiness management and Part 21 engineering organizations. “A thorough check-up is needed, even when the storage was for less than four months.”

Given the severe financial pressure on MRO providers, airlines are shopping for sweeter, long-term deals for maintenance. “There is an increase of larger tenders on the market,” Motschenbacher says.

In contrast, lessors only commit to base maintenance when they have found a new lessee. “They want their assets well-serviced and often converted,” Motschenbacher explains. Some lessors are worried that reactivation of commercial aircraft will cause a slot shortage for MRO servicing and delay handovers to new lessees.

Paul Dolan, CEO of ATS, foresees very strong demand for A320-family maintenance in the next 12 months. He expects MROs will have to struggle to meet the demand for maintenance on both A320s and Boeing 737s.

Dolan also sees demand from both airlines and lessors. “Airlines are scrambling to support lift requirements as the market surges back, and lessors are trying to market and support incoming requirements to add aircraft to lessee fleets,” he says.

Dolan estimates that light maintenance on A320s typically takes 10-12 days, with heavier visits requiring 20-35 days. Motschenbacher also sees a wide range of turnaround times. The first C check on a new A320 at 24 months with limited work and no mods can take just five days and 1,500 workhours. But heavy maintenance, sometimes with lifetime extension and structural modifications and rectifications, can go up to 40 days and require 20,000 workhours. On average, he puts A320 base maintenance at about 24 days.

Apart from regular MRO tasks, A320s often require work to satisfy advisory circulars and service bulletins. Motschenbacher says extra work must also be done for corrosion found in wet areas and on wing skins for some aircraft.

At AFI KLM E&M, Head of Business Intelligence Ahmoss Messayeh says some airlines are splitting heavy checks into smaller workscopes to retain capacity, cash and aircraft availability during the summer. His company is also seeing requests from lessors to provide lease-return and storage maintenance.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9142341017723083}",neutral,0.9142341017723083,0

SKY’s A321neo aircraft are powered by CFM Leap-1A engines and can seat up to 238 passengers in a two-class layout. SKY is the first airline in South America to operate the A321neo with a high density cabin configuration.

The A321neo has a 95 percent airframe commonality with Airbus’ A320 Family, fitting seamlessly into SKY’s existing fleet of 19 A320neo. This aircraft incorporates new generation engines and Sharklets, which together deliver more than 20 percent fuel and CO2 savings, as well as a 50 percent noise reduction. Additionally, The A321neo shares a common type rating with other members of the Airbus A320 Family, which allows A320 Family pilots to fly the aircraft without additional training.

SKY has been an Airbus customer since 2010 and became an all-Airbus operator in 2013. The A321neo will allow SKY to further expand their route offering in Latin America in the near future.

Airbus has sold over 1,100 aircraft and has a backlog of nearly 430 aircraft to deliver in Latin America and the Caribbean. Currently, Airbus has over 660 aircraft in operation throughout the region, representing approximately 60 percent market share of the in-service fleet. Since 1994, Airbus has secured nearly 70 percent of net orders in the region.

"United's order reinvigorates Max programme, but Airbus deal casts unwelcome shadow - Flightglobal","Wed, 07 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mbGlnaHRnbG9iYWwuY29tL2FpcmZyYW1lcnMvdW5pdGVkcy1vcmRlci1yZWludmlnb3JhdGVzLW1heC1wcm9ncmFtbWUtYnV0LWFpcmJ1cy1kZWFsLWNhc3RzLXVud2VsY29tZS1zaGFkb3cvMTQ0NDkwLmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"There is no getting away from the fact that United Airlines’ recent 200-unit order for Boeing’s 737 Max throws considerable – and much needed – additional momentum behind the programme, even if the airframer had to offer a significant discount to secure the business.

But the carrier’s simultaneous deal with Airbus for another large batch of A321neos is an unwelcome reminder that the European airframer is continuing to encroach on Boeing’s turf.

Unveiled on 29 June, the parallel commitments comprised 50 737 Max 8s and 150 Max 10s – the largest variant of the 737 Max family – plus 70 A321neos. United expects to begin operating both the Max 10s and A321neos in early 2023, around the time that Boeing plans to deliver its first examples of the variant.

That deal for A321neos – added to an existing commitment for 50 of the longer-range A321XLRs – is illustrative of the success Airbus is having with the largest variant in its narrowbody line-up.

“Those 70 [A321neos] could have been 737s, but Boeing doesn’t have an airplane that can do what the A321 can,” says BofA Securities financial analyst Ron Epstein. “To me, the real story is [that] Airbus is taking more share at an airline that… was leaning heavily toward Boeing.”

Analysts view the split order as perfectly logical. The airline can use its 737 Max fleet primarily to operate domestic flights – a role well suited for the 737 Max 10. That jet can carry more passengers than other Max variants and has 3,300nm (6,110km) range – enough to fly transcontinental US routes.

Meanwhile, United can deploy its new A321neos on both domestic and international routes, and from slot-constrained airports. With a baseline range of 4,000nm – rising to 4,700nm for the in-development A321XLR – those jets can serve transatlantic destinations from places like Newark, a major East Coast hub for the airline.

BofA pegs the list-price value of the combined Airbus-Boeing orders at $30 billion, though airlines, particularly those the size of United, do not pay list prices. The actual value of a new 737 Max 8 is $49.6 million, compared to $49 million for an A320neo, according to Cirium, which also values a 737 Max 10 at $54.6 million, and an A321neo at $58.8 million.

“It’s a win for United because they probably got very good pricing coming out of a downturn,” says George Dimitroff, head of valuations at Ascend by Cirium. “I’m almost certain [the Max 10 price] was cheaper than the A321, which explains why they ordered 150 Max 10s.”

Dimitroff says the deal’s heavy tilt toward Max 10s further benefits Boeing because those jets command a higher price than smaller Max 8s and Max 9s, but cost comparatively little more to produce. “Even if United got a sweet deal for the Max 10, Boeing is getting more money for the Max 10,” he says.

Analysts also view United’s order as an endorsement for the Max 8, which the airline chose over the A320neo.

“I think its important to acknowledge that… in sheer performance and technical merits, the Max 8 is doing better than the A320,” says Michel Merluzeau, analyst with consultancy AIR.

In a two-class layout, the Max 8 can carry about 162 passengers – eight more than the A320neo – and costs 5-8% less per seat-mile to operate, according to data from AIR affiliate AirInsight Group.

“If you line up the 737 Max [8] to an A320, it’s a better plane,” Epstein adds.

WHITE TAILS

Some additional good news for Boeing can also be discerned from United’s commitment: disclosing its new order, the airline said only 25 of the incoming 737 Max will be white tails – meaning aircraft that have been built but which are not assigned to specific customers. Boeing’s inventory of such jets has accumulated in recent years as airlines cancelled orders amid the Max grounding and Covid-19 pandemic.

In 2020, the airframer logged 641 Max cancellations, offset by new orders for 130 of the jets. Last year, Boeing also stripped another roughly 550 Max orders from its backlog to reflect uncertainty that those sales would complete due to factors including the financial condition of the buyers.

That trend has reversed in 2021. In the year to date, Boeing has landed new orders for at least 505 737 Max, offset by 255 cancellations, according to customer reports and Boeing’s data. (Those figures will likely change, as Boeing has not yet reported final June order and delivery numbers). Besides United, Alaska Airlines, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise, SMBC Aviation Capital and Southwest Airlines have ordered Max aircraft in 2021.

Boeing has logged hundreds of 737 Max orders this year Customer 2021 Max orders 777 Partners 24 Air Lease 3 Alaska Airlines 45 Dubai Aerospace Enterprise 14 SMBC Aviation Capital 14 Southest Airlines 134 United Airlines 250 Unidentified customers 21 Gross 2021 orders* 505 2021 Cancellations* 255 Net 2021 orders* 250 * Includes full data through May and United’s June order Source: Boeing and customers

As of 1 July, Boeing’s pool of completed aircraft included only 23 Max white tails, according to Rob Morris, Ascend by Cirium global head of consultancy.

“Those orders seem to have cleared up the inventory of white tails,” his colleague Dimitroff says. Finding customers for those jets can help Boeing “slowly increase their pricing on the Max”, he adds.

SHIFTING MARKET SHARE

As one of its most loyal customers, the United deal was always Boeing’s to lose. The carrier is the product of the merger between the legacy United Airlines and Continental Airlines, a famously staunch Boeing operator long headed by Gordon Bethune, who had previously worked at the airframer.

That is not to say the airline has shied away from Airbus products. Pre-merger United was an early customer of first-generation A320-family jets. It still has nearly 200 of those in service and storage, but aged between 14 and 28 years, they are quickly approaching retirement. United also holds orders for 45 A350s, Cirium data shows.

But the bulk of United’s narrowbody fleet are 737s. It has nearly 375 of those jets, including many new 737NGs and 737 Max jets, plus outstanding previous orders for another 180 737 Max aircraft.

For those reasons, United might have been expected to stick solely with the Max for its narrowbody requirements. But the type’s grounding set the programme back and threw Boeing off track, says Epstein. The company has not moved forward with a 757/767 replacement – the so-called “mid-market jet” that the aerospace community expected Boeing would have launched several years ago.

If not for the Max issues and associated fallout, “all those airplanes would have been 737s”, Epstein says. “And Boeing probably would have had an answer in the middle of the market.”

Analysts view United’s A321neo orders as reflecting continued inroads into the middle market made by the European manufacturer.

Ten years ago, Boeing’s 737 and legacy McDonnell Douglas types held about 60% of the global narrowbody market, with A320-family jets accounting for the remainder, Cirium data shows.

Those figures have since shifted to an almost 50-50 split between the two airframers. At the end of May, Airbus had 6,144 A220s and A320-family jets in its backlog, compared with Boeing’s 4,014-strong Max order book.

Analyst Richard Aboulafia of Teal Group has predicted that the A321neo’s success could drive Airbus’s share of the narrowbody market to 60%. As of end-May it had taken total orders for 3,472 examples, around 46% of total A320neo-family sales, the airframer’s data shows.

MID-MARKET, STILL OPEN

Industry watchers also broadly view United’s order as another reminder that neither Boeing nor Airbus offer a jet truly filling the mid-market niche – the space long occupied by 757s and 767s.

United chief executive Scott Kirby said the incoming jets will replace the airline’s roughly 40 757-200s, which have up to 176 seats in the airline’s configuration. But he said the carrier has not identified replacements for its roughly 20 757-300s – larger jets with 234 seats.

Boeing has hinted at developing a mid-market jet for years. In early 2020, amid the Max struggles, it shelved a project called the “New Mid-market Airplane”.

Epstein and other analysts worry Boeing might have trouble executing such a project. He notes that nearly all the company’s current programmes – the Max, 787, 777X and 767-based KC-46 military tanker – have suffered recent problems. Also, Boeing reportedly let go a host of senior managers and engineers amid the industry downturn.

“Capital is easy. Engineering is not,” Epstein says. “It’s really concerning.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997352957725525}",neutral,0.9997352957725525,0

TIANJIN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Airbus has inaugurated its A350 aircraft project at its widebody completion and delivery center in north China's Tianjin. It is the first time the European planemaker has launched such a project for the A350 outside Europe.

It delivered an A350 aircraft to China Eastern Airlines at the Airbus Tianjin Widebody Completion and Delivery Center on Wednesday.

""Airbus values China as a long-term strategic market. We have full confidence in the resilience and dynamics of China's economy and its aviation industry,"" said George Xu, executive vice president of Airbus and chief executive officer of Airbus China.

""The new move demonstrates our commitments to deepening the win-win cooperation with China and better serving local customers through more localized solutions and resources,"" Xu added.

A350 WIDEBODIES COMING

A total of five A350 widebodies will be delivered in Tianjin in 2021, and more deliveries to Chinese customers are underway as the center has ramped up its production rate and market demand is recovering, according to Airbus China.

The A350 is Airbus' new generation of widebody aircraft, which highlights environmental performance, flight range and comfort. To date, the company has received 915 orders for the aircraft and delivered some 430 worldwide. Approximately 10 percent of the deliveries were to the Chinese market.

Located near the site of the Airbus A320 Family Final Assembly Line in Tianjin, the Airbus Tianjin Widebody Completion and Delivery Center includes a cabin equipping and furnishing facility and a paint shop.

Rolling off the final assembly line in Toulouse, France, the unfinished green A350 aircraft will fly to Tianjin. Green aircraft means that the aircraft has not been painted with its outermost layer paint and has not yet been fully completed.

""They will receive the full scope of aircraft completion activities here, such as the cabin installation, aircraft painting, engine run, flight test and customer flight acceptance. The aircraft will then be delivered to customers,"" said Dr. Christoph Schrempp, general manager of Airbus Tianjin Delivery Center.

CHINA-EUROPE COOPERATION

""Tianjin is endeavoring to become an aviation industry cluster. We are confident that the new project will deepen our long-term cooperation and inject strong impetus to the high-quality development here,"" said Ma Shunqing, executive vice mayor of Tianjin.

The city targets to build eight related centers, including fields of assembly, production support, engineering, maintenance, logistics, professional training, customer services and financial services.

Tianjin is now the world's only non-European city that could deliver both single-aisle and widebody Airbus aircraft. Airbus inaugurated the final assembly line for its A320 single-aisle aircraft here in 2008, and the completion and delivery facilities for widebody aircraft in 2017.

""In joint hands with Chinese partners, we are building role model projects of China-Europe cooperation,"" said Xu.

Through these projects, Airbus shares its expertise and management experiences in manufacturing with Chinese partners. And the strengthening Chinese aviation industry has greatly sustained the Airbus global supply chain.

COMMON COMMITMENTS TO FUTURE

""China's civil aviation industry is a fully competitive market. The country has also led the recovery of the global civil aviation industry. We believe that there is huge potential for our strategic cooperation,"" said Xu.

Airbus plans to enhance services to local customers in fields such as aircraft maintenance, passenger-to-freight aircraft conversion, digitalization and energy conservation and emissions reduction.

""Airbus has a core value of making the aviation industry sustainable. We share common commitments with China."" Xu said that Airbus is pursuing a sustainable aviation goal by adopting sustainable aviation fuel and developing hydrogen-driven aircraft, among others.

China is forging ahead in renewable energy development amid its transition to a low-carbon economy. The country has announced that it would strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.

""It shows a great nation's responsibility and determination. Our commitments and goals integrate,"" Xu said, adding that Airbus' commitments to China remain unchanged, with more potential ahead. Enditem","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999470710754395}",neutral,0.9999470710754395,0

“I’m proud that Airbus successfully extended the capability of the wide-body C&DC in Tianjin to the A350, the latest new generation aircraft, at such a difficult time of global aviation,” said George Xu, Airbus Executive Vice President and Airbus China CEO. “This is a new milestone in the long-term cooperation between China and Airbus, which further demonstrates Airbus’ commitment to the country. Congratulations to China Eastern Airlines, our long-term strategic partner, for receiving the first A350 delivered from China, and I appreciate their trust in Airbus and in our products as always.”

Located at the same site as the Airbus Tianjin A320 Family Final Assembly Line and the Airbus Tianjin Delivery Centre, the wide-body C&DC covers the aircraft completion activities, including cabin installation, aircraft painting and production flight test, as well as customer flight acceptance and aircraft delivery.

The center was inaugurated in September 2017 with its capability on A330s. Then, during the visit of French President Emmanuel Macron to China in 2019, a Memorandum of Understanding on the Further Development of Industrial Cooperation was signed in Beijing by He Lifeng, Chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) of China, and Guillaume Faury, Airbus Chief Executive Officer, announcing the C&DC would extend its capability to A350 aircraft.

The A350 features the latest aerodynamic design, a carbon-fiber fuselage and wings, plus new fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce engines. Together, these features translate into unrivalled levels of operational efficiency with a 25 per cent reduction in fuel burn and CO2 emissions. The A350’s ‘Airspace by Airbus’ cabin is the quietest of any wide-body aircraft and offers passengers and crews the most modern in-flight products for the most comfortable flying experience.

At the end of June 2021, the A350 Family had received 915 firm orders from 49 customers worldwide, making it one of the most successful wide-body aircraft ever.

Mobile's Airbus factory to add staff following United Airlines order - Alabama Public Radio,"Thu, 08 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwci5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA3LTA4L21vYmlsZXMtYWlyYnVzLWZhY3RvcnktdG8tYWRkLXN0YWZmLWZvbGxvd2luZy11bml0ZWQtYWlybGluZXMtb3JkZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An APR News Feature

Mobile’s Airbus factory plans to start hiring again following United Airlines jet purchase A new aircraft order from United Airlines could be good news for the city of Mobile. The air carrier wants 70 Airbus A320s. Many of those aircraft will be built in the port city.

As COVID-19 numbers drop, air travel is on the rise. Aircraft plants are ramping up production to meet the demand for new planes. That’s good news at the Airbus plant in Mobile. That’s where many of the company’s A320 and A220 airplanes are assembled.

“The U.S. airlines appear to be in a relatively healthy condition, certainly on the domestic side and keen to re-enter into picking up their aircraft, especially out of Mobile. That’s the good news,” said Airbus Vice President Daryl Taylor.

He directs the company’s US assembly line in Mobile.

“We’re about two years behind where we were going to be, but now with requirements that are actually higher than pre-COVID by the middle of 2024. That’s the good news,” he said.

Airbus doesn’t give out production numbers for specific plants. Taylor said the four plants producing A 320s and A220s in Mobile, Germany, France and China have a current goal of building 45 of these passenger jets every month. In 2019, they were making 60 with plans to go up to 63. Now the goal is 64 by 2023 and 70 by the year after that. By 2025, the goal is a potential of 75 Airbus jets.

“That’s why we’re not in a position to say locally what that really means because there’s a lot of pieces moving in the industrial system in terms of how many of those aircraft will be picked up per month in Mobile. But what I would say is it certainly isn’t bad news for Mobile,” Taylor said.

Taylor said air travel is expected to keep increasing, particularly in the United States.

“Europe and the U.S. dropped off significantly, but the U.S. over the last three or four months has seen a significant re-energizing of the market and a recovery and I think we’ve gone from low 1.2 million, 1.3 million to closer to 2 million per day flying through and that’s primarily in the domestic market,” Taylor said.

The types of jets assembled in Mobile are in particular demand.

“What we’ve seen in Airbus in particular is certainly on the single-aisle, which is what we build here in Mobile, the 320, 321 family is that we didn’t see cancellations. We saw delays and now we see these delays coming back to be requested and rather than a slower ramp-up, we now see a steeper ramp-up,” Taylor said.

That’s a big change from a year ago. Taylor said that in early 2020, he saw a sign of how things had changed almost overnight when he came to work at Mobile’s Brookley complex.

“I think at Brookley one of the clear indicators at that time was American Airlines had up to 30 wide-body Boeing aircraft actually being stored down here on one of the runways and when you drove into work, it was quite a stark view of where we were in the industry,” Taylor said.

Airbus slowed production, but never laid off any Mobile employees. They did watch the industry carefully to see how the workforce, supply chain and demand were being affected by the Coronavirus.

“The great news is we got through 2020 without a reduction of workforce,” Taylor said. “So, we had reached right around 1,000 direct employees at the beginning of 2020. While we didn’t hire during 2020 except for a very few, very critical positions that we had to backfill, we also didn’t actively reduce workforce. This year, we plan to recruit about 150 employees here in Mobile. We’ll pass 1,100 active head counts here during 2021 and if you look at our total head count that’s onsite, when you add our suppliers, we outsource several of our work packages, logistics, maintenance and things like that, we’re probably closer to 1,350, 1,400 and I would expect that to be closer to 1,500 by the end of the year.”

During the pandemic, Airbus and other Mobile manufacturers worked with the Mobile Chamber of Commerce to determine how to deal with COVID-19.

“The aim of that activity was, one, to make sure that as a set of organizations we were really aligning on the best practices to keep our employees employed and safe and I think that was hugely beneficial,” Taylor said. “There were many best practices that I was able to pick up from my counterparts and understand how we bring those best practices into place and we ran that religiously throughout the year of 2020 and sort of reconvened it a little bit as we started to get back to the vaccination protocol.”

“One of the great things that came out of COVID is that there was more engagement and connectivity among our members than I have ever seen and so there were several different groups that sort of formed,” said Bill Sisson.

He’s president of the Mobile Chamber. He said about 18 CEOs of the region’s top manufacturers took part in the working group.

“They were really able to exchange a lot of great information, updating each other on what they were doing as far as policies, what their COVID cases looked like, if they had any great ideas on how to encourage their employees to get vaccinated, those kinds of things,” Sisson said.

Manufacturing is big in Mobile, more than twice the national level.

“I do know that they make up about 18% of our economy here, so we have a very strong manufacturing sector here. I think the average nationally is like 8% and we’re at 18% so there’s a lot of manufacturing here,” Sission said. “And, as I said they were continuing to operate. Now, they were challenged, we heard from all of them that they were challenged with employees who got COVID and had to be out, so they had absenteeism to deal with, but generally speaking, they’ve been able to navigate that as well.”

Those manufacturers also affect smaller suppliers that work with the plants. Airbus has about 20 suppliers. One of those is MAAS Aviation, a European-based company that now hires about 60 people in Mobile. They paint the finished Airbus jets.

“And so, we’ve been operating in Mobile since 2016,” said Geoffrey Myrick, who directs MAAS operations in the United States.

“We began with one paint shop and in 2017, we grew our capacity here at Brookley Field to include two additional paint shops and so right now today, we are currently operating three paint shops at Brookley Field,” Myrick said. “They are all dedicated to Airbus and since inception here, we have grown to not only paint the A320 family, but also now the A220 series of aircraft as well. We were really fortunate in that we were able to sustain our headcount, our staffing levels throughout the course of the pandemic. So, there was a combination of scheduling management and working with the team members here to make sure that we could keep the staff count level throughout the course of the pandemic, because we knew that despite the lowest of the lows last year that the workload was going to come back. The industry was going to recover and thankfully, now, we’re seeing good signs of that.”

Myrick said the United airlines order of new Airbus passenger jet is one of those good signs for Mobile.

“The big aircraft order announcement, which includes Airbus aircraft, from United Airlines,” Myrick said. “That type of news is very exciting for us and I’m sure all of the others in our industry as well. So, I think anytime they’re finding success, we hope to be able to expand our partnership with them to help us as well as to help Airbus.""

Sisson said the order shows that no one knows when things will be completely back to pre-pandemic levels. But, the news appears to be improving for Airbus and Mobile.

“They ordered 70 Airbus A321 neo aircraft and a significant number of those will be manufactured in Mobile,” Sisson said. “So that’s good news and the 320 just continues to get thousands of orders and even though there’s some question marks about when the airlines will get back to where they were pre-COVID there’s a lot of pent-up demand for the products that Airbus is assembling here in Mobile.”

Taylor said he’s looking forward to seeing more Airbus aircraft roll off the line in Mobile.

“We’re excited to see people flying again and we’re very proud that we were able to get through the first 18 months of COVID without any forced layoffs, forced redundancies and to maintain an active workforce that’s engaged. We’re even more excited that we’re able to add some headcount right now and we’re delighted to see aircraft leaving our premises and being utilized by our customers,” said Taylor.

Boeing vs. Airbus: Which Aerospace Stock Could Fetch Higher Returns In 2021? - Yahoo Finance,"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9ib2VpbmctdnMtYWlyYnVzLWFlcm9zcGFjZS1zdG9jay0xNDE1MTgzNzAuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the commercial aerospace industry, as travel has declined dramatically, resulting in a significant reduction in aircraft demand.

According to a Deloitte report, while the commercial aerospace sector is expected to recover, albeit slowly, travel is unlikely to return to pre-pandemic levels before 2024.

Using the TipRanks stock comparison tool, let us compare two aerospace companies, Boeing and Airbus, and see how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks.

Boeing (BA)

Boeing’s commercial aircrafts business has been in trouble lately, with regulatory pressure leading to delays in the company’s scheduled aircraft deliveries. Let us look at whether these regulatory pressures could drag down the stock and how it could impact its aircraft deliveries.

Boeing is expected to announce its Q2 results on July 28.

Last week, the company announced its Q2 deliveries. The company delivered 50 narrow-body 737 commercial airplanes, followed by 12 wide-body 787 models.

The company added that it has made more progress in Q2 to return the 737 Max to service in more international markets, as well as ramping up the rate of 737 deliveries.

However, according to a Reuters report from earlier this week, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has asked the operators of Boeing 737 airplanes to inspect and address the issue of failure of cabin altitude pressure switches. According to FAA, the failure of the cabin altitude pressure switches could result in falling oxygen level in the planes.

BA stated that it supported the FAA’s direction, which makes mandatory the inspection interval that it issued to the fleet in June.

To add to the company’s woes, last week, Boeing stated that undelivered 787s would require more work after the FAA identified certain manufacturing quality issues while undertaking a system-wide inspection of Boeing’s 787 shimming processes.

The FAA said that the problem lies near the nose of some of the planes but does not pose any immediate threat to flight safety. Boeing announced that it would fix the issue before sending the aircraft out for delivery. (See Boeing stock chart on TipRanks)

Story continues

Following the news of the setback regarding 787 airplanes, Cowen analyst Cai Rumohr reiterated a Buy and a price target of $290 (40.1% upside) on the stock. While Rumohr acknowledged the setback regarding the 787 deliveries, the analyst was optimistic regarding BA.

He stated, “However, improving air traffic as VAX [vaccination] rates rise is starting to bolster demand; and while lingering stringent FAA oversight and timing of China's MAX approval limit upside to 2021, 2022-24 look brighter.”

The analyst stated that by the end of the year, BA expects to deliver less than fifty of the around one hundred 787s that it has in its inventory. As a result, Rumohr has trimmed the “2021 estimate by $0.30 to a loss of $1.65; and we're hiking 2022 by $0.15/share to a profit of $2.00 assuming that some but not all of the 787 shortfall is recovered in 2022. However, we still see $6.00/share in 'core' EPS by 2024.”

Rumohr expects BA to reach a cash flow of $21 per share by 2024.

Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 9 Buys and 8 Holds. The average Boeing price target of $274.21 implies approximately 15.1% upside potential to current levels.

Airbus Group SE (EADSF)

Airbus’s reportable business segments include Airbus, Airbus Helicopters, and Airbus Defense and Space. Airbus is expected to report its Q2 results on July 29.

The company recently stated its commercial aircraft orders and delivery numbers at the end of Q2. Airbus delivered 816 commercial A300 / A310 aircraft against the same number of orders. At the end of Q2, the company had a total of 20,414 orders with 13,489 commercial aircraft delivered.

According to Deutsche Bank analyst Christophe Menard, deliveries of commercial aircraft in Q2 were up by 98 units, with higher-than-expected volumes. As a result, the analyst expects sales of €10.5 billion, up 111% year-over-year, and a positive swing for EBIT at €2.8 billion.

The analyst added, “The bulk would be the reversal in fixed cost absorption (we estimated €1.8bn), but higher A320 volumes and improved mix could contribute €900m.”

Menard has a Buy rating and a price target of €122 on the stock.

When it comes to Airbus’s Helicopters and Defense and Space business, the analyst expects profitability levels to be similar in Q2. According to Menard, the helicopter business is expected to have a profit margin of 9% while Defense and Space is projected to have a profit margin of 8%, versus the same period last year.

Menard added, “Our 2021 figures are based on 600 deliveries, which looks realistic, but increasingly conservative.”

In Q1, Airbus’s revenues remained stable year-over-year at €10.5 billion. The company reported an adjusted EBIT of €694 million versus €281 million in the same quarter last year. (See Airbus stock chart on TipRanks)

Airbus reported earnings per share of €0.46 in Q1 versus a loss per share of €0.61 in the same period last year.

Airbus stated in its press release that it hopes to achieve the same number of commercial aircraft deliveries as last year in FY21, while its adjusted EBIT is projected to be €2 billion.

Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy, based on 10 Buys and 6 Holds. The average Airbus price target of $145.08 implies approximately 19% upside potential to current levels.

Bottom Line

While analysts are cautiously optimistic about both stocks, based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, Airbus seems to be a better Buy.

The Airbus A220 Will Be a Game Changer for JetBlue - The Motley Fool,"Tue, 06 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA3LzA2L3RoZS1haXJidXMtYTIyMC13aWxsLWJlLWEtZ2FtZS1jaGFuZ2VyLWZvci1qZXRibHVlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The carrier's newest jet model will reduce the airline's unit costs while opening up numerous growth opportunities.

Three years ago, JetBlue Airways (JBLU -3.67%) announced plans to replace its 60 Embraer E190s on a one-for-one basis with Airbus (EADSY -1.30%) A220-300s. (It exercised options for 10 additional A220s in 2019.) JetBlue estimated that the new A220s would have 29% lower operating costs per seat than its E190s.

Airbus delivered JetBlue's first A220 at the very end of 2020, and that aircraft entered service in late April. As the airline's A220 fleet increases in the coming years, it will unlock huge earnings growth opportunities.

More than just a fleet modernization program

The A220 is compelling as a direct replacement for JetBlue's E190s. The carrier is configuring its A220-300s with 140 seats, compared to 100 for its E190s. Despite this big discrepancy in seating capacity, the two models cost similar amounts to operate on a per-trip basis, thanks to the A220's low maintenance costs and dramatically superior fuel efficiency.

At the time of the order, JetBlue said it expected each A220 to generate $4 million to $5 million of incremental annual profit compared to the E190s they would replace. That would boost JetBlue's overall pre-tax margin by about 3 percentage points and increase earnings per share by $0.65 by the time the fleet transition wraps up in 2025.

However, the A220 can do a lot more than fly short-haul routes (the E190 fleet's bread and butter). It has enough range to operate transcontinental routes and even some trans-Atlantic routes.

This means that JetBlue can use the A220s more than its E190s -- for example, by operating transcontinental flights during the overnight hours when they would otherwise sit idle. Additionally, a few years down the road, the A220 could replace some of JetBlue's aging Airbus A320s.

The A220 will unlock new growth opportunities

In recent years, transcontinental flights have become an increasingly important part of JetBlue's business. The carrier has rolled out its upscale Mint service in numerous wealthy, high-demand markets like New York-Los Angeles. Meanwhile, it has used its A320 fleet to serve a handful of smaller transcontinental markets, like Buffalo-Los Angeles and New York-Ontario, California.

These niche markets have grown in importance lately. Last September, JetBlue announced new routes connecting Los Angeles to Charleston, South Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; and West Palm Beach, Florida -- markets that previously lacked nonstop flights to L.A. Two weeks later, it announced new routes from Hartford, Connecticut, to Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. And just last week, JetBlue began flying from New York to Kalispell, Montana, and Boise, Idaho.

Yet these routes haven't all been successful. Last month, JetBlue downgraded the Richmond-Los Angeles route to seasonal status. It has also exited or suspended several other transcontinental routes.

Shifting service to the A220 could turn many loss-making or marginally profitable transcontinental routes into strong performers. In addition to having somewhat lower unit costs than JetBlue's A320s, the A220-300 will generate much stronger unit revenue on ""long and thin"" routes (long-distance routes that don't have enough traffic to warrant a wide-body aircraft). After all, JetBlue's A320s have 22 additional seats compared to its A220s. In smaller markets, it would typically have to sell those seats at very low fares -- if it could fill them at all.

Investors should be patient

The Airbus A220 won't have a meaningful impact on JetBlue's profitability this year or in 2022. The low-fare airline has just three A220s today. It expects to have eight by year-end, with another nine set to arrive in 2022. With such a small fleet of A220-300s, crew training and other transition costs will outweigh the benefit of the model's excellent economics in the near term.

But JetBlue expects to receive another 18 A220s in 2023 and 22 in 2024. That will unlock the savings the carrier touted when it placed its initial order in 2018. It will also give it a big enough A220 fleet to start testing the new jet on a variety of long-and-thin routes.

Thanks to the A220's combination of long range, low trip costs, and low unit costs, JetBlue is likely to find many new growth opportunities that wouldn't be viable otherwise. That could encourage it to order more A220s in the years ahead.

And half of its fleet of 130 A320s will be at least 20 years old by 2025. The carrier will probably replace some of those planes with 200-seat A321neos. In other cases, replacing A320s with the slightly smaller A220 will maximize JetBlue's margins by helping the carrier to better match capacity to demand while keeping unit costs low.

By enabling new growth opportunities while replacing E190s (and eventually A320s) in a highly accretive manner, the Airbus A220 will likely have a transformative impact on JetBlue's earnings. It could take a decade or more to capture the full upside, though, so investors should be patient.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999128580093384}",positive,0.9999128580093384,1

Safran cautions on Airbus production targets | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWVyb3NwYWNlL3NhZnJhbi1jYXV0aW9ucy1vbi1haXJidXMtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi10YXJnZXRzLzE0NDgzMi5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Safran’s chief executive believes an Airbus target to be building more than 70 single-aisle aircraft a month by the middle of the decade may be over-ambitious.

However, detailing the French aerospace group’s half-year results on 28 July, Olivier Andries said output of “well over 60 can be sustainable”. The European airframer plans monthly production of 64 A320neo-family airliners by the second quarter of 2023.

It comes as Safran, which builds with GE Aviation the CFM International Leap engine that is fitted to all Boeing 737 Max aircraft and around half of all A320neo-family narrowbodies, gears up for a rebound in the commercial aviation market after an improvement in its second-quarter performance.

The group, which also makes cabin products, nacelles, and defence electronics, saw recurring operating income for the six months drop 30.4%, to €659 million ($783 million), on revenue 21.6% lower at €6.88 billion.

Referring to the long-term Airbus targets, Andries says Safran has been “listening carefully to all our customers…and I have to say, we are not sure that the market has the appetite of such heights”. He says the company has agreed the number of engines it will deliver to the airframer in 2021 and 2022, with 2023 shipments under discussion.

Safran will deliver “north of 800” Leap engines in total this year, says Andries, a “small step-up” on 2020, a year in which the Max was largely grounded. Most of this will be a result of an increase in Leap-1As for Airbus as Safran had delivered many Leap-1Bs to Boeing “in advance” during 2020.

Delivery numbers for engines remained lower in the first half of 2021 than in the same period in 2020, with shipments of CFM powerplants at 448 units, compared with 534 a year ago.

However, Safran says it has secured notable pieces of business, including IndiGo selecting the Leap-1A for its 310 new Airbus narrowbodies, and United Airlines purchasing 200 more Leap 1B-powered Max jets.

Services make up around half of Safran’s revenues, and they remained under pressure in the first half with so much of the global fleet grounded or under-utilised. Civil aftermarket revenue was down over a quarter. However, Safran also sees signs of improvement there, with weekly CFM engine flight cycles down 35% in July compared with 2019. The corresponding difference in April was 46%.

Andries says he is confident a recovery begun in the second quarter will continue through the year. However, he cautions: “The second half will be essential to see if the effects of the anticipated recovery in air traffic in quarters three and four are reflected in the full-year results.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6071884036064148}",positive,0.6071884036064148,1

United Airlines has placed an order for 70 Airbus A321neo aircraft. This follows orders for 50 Airbus A321XLR aircraft from the company, Airbus said.

The A321neo, first rolled out in 2018, reportedly incorporates a LEAP engine with fan blades made from 3D woven resin transfer molding (RTM) carbon fiber composite.

According to the company, the A321neo has the lowest CO2 emissions per seat in its class and will help United reduce the airline’s CO2 emissions 100% by 2050.

‘Such a significant order from a great airline like United underscores that the A321neo offers unmatched capabilities, operating economics, and passenger friendliness,’ claimed Christian Scherer, Airbus COO.

As of the end of May 2021, the A320neo range had achieved 7,400 firm orders from 121 customers, Airbus said.

“Furthermore and following Board approval, we are enhancing our product line with an A350 freighter derivative, responding to customer feedback for increased competition and efficiency in this market segment,” said Airbus Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury.

The decision to develop a freighter version of its Airbus A350 passenger aircraft comes after the manufacturer saw a demand for new freighters from their customers. Airbus is aiming to debut the new Airbus A350 freighter in 2025. However, the European planemaker has not indicated any potential launch customers.

However, Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker said the Doha-based air carrier was keen to add more freighters to its fleet, as the air freight market is likely to remain strong after the COVID-19 crisis is resolved. During an interview on June 22, 2021, the boss of Qatar Airways indicated that the airline would be “very keen” to be a launch customer for either Airbus A350 or Boeing 777X freighter if the aircraft manufacturers would make those aircraft available.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9859827160835266}",positive,0.9859827160835266,1
How many Airbus A380s are left to deliver? - AeroTime,"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjg0OTgtaG93LW1hbnktYWlyYnVzLWEzODBzLWFyZS1sZWZ0LXRvLWRlbGl2ZXLSAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZXJvdGltZS5hZXJvL2FydGljbGVzLzI4NDk4LWhvdy1tYW55LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwcy1hcmUtbGVmdC10by1kZWxpdmVyL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The status of the Airbus A380 has been under question even before the pandemic took its toll on the air transport industry. The European aircraft manufacturer decided to end the Super Jumbo production in February 2019. More than two years have passed and the situation with the Airbus A380 has only deteriorated, as operators started phasing out the four-engine double-decker, which is known to have a limited second-hand market.

Now that the Airbus A380 program is coming to an end, AeroTime takes a look at how many Super Jumbos are left to deliver.

Airbus A380 deliveries nearing the end

In the first half of 2021, Airbus delivered a total of two Airbus A380 aircraft. Both Super Jumbos, registered as A6-EVO and A6-EVP, were delivered to Emirates ‒ the world’s largest Airbus A380 operator. Now, Airbus has just three Airbus A380 aircraft left to deliver. Yet again, all three outstanding deliveries are bound to join the Dubai-based Emirates fleet.

The last-ever Airbus A380 aircraft, Manufacturer Serial Number (MSN) 272, is expected to be delivered in May 2022, Emirates president Sir Tim Clark revealed in late 2020. The two remaining double-deckers, registered as A6-EVQ and A6-EVR, are reportedly scheduled to be delivered in the first half of 2022. By May 2022, the carrier would have a fleet of 122 Super Jumbos in its fleet.

AeroTime News reached out to Emirates for a comment regarding the dates of the last three A380 deliveries and did not receive an answer at the time of publication.

In February 2019, Airbus and Emirates agreed to reduce the total order for the A380 from 162 to 123 aircraft and include up to 40 Airbus A330-900neos and 30 Airbus A350-900 aircraft instead. As Emirates, Airbus’ main customer, shrank its order book, the manufacturer announced the cancellation of the production of the A380.

“As a result of this decision we have no substantial A380 backlog and hence no basis to sustain production, despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years. This leads to the end of A380 deliveries in 2021,” Airbus Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders revealed in a statement on February 14, 2019.

Airbus had a total of 251 orders of A380 aircraft with the last three yet to be delivered to Emirates.

Future of Emirates’ Airbus A380s

The ongoing struggles with the Boeing 777X delivery timeline are raising questions about the future of Emirates’ Airbus A380s, which are destined to be replaced with Boeing’s yet-to-be-certified widebody. Now that there are just three A380s left to deliver, the question which begs the answer is how long will Emirates keep Super Jumbos in its fleet?

Emirates, having a quite hefty fleet of Airbus A380s ‒ 119 with one being retired ‒ reaffirmed its belief in the double-decker. “The A380 […] will continue in the plan until the mid-2030s,” said Sir Tim Clark, while speaking during CAPA Live on February 10, 2021.

However, the Super Jumbo retirement might be further postponed, as Clark revealed in a conversation with the aviation consultant John Strictland that he had doubts the airline’s first Boeing 777X aircraft would come before 2024. Such a delay might make the A380 fly even longer.

Additionally to the A380 replacement delays, there are more arguments to keep the type flying longer. Especially since Emirates not that long ago introduced the Premium Economy class/seats on its double-deckers.

The largest Super Jumbo operator in the world will have to eventually retire the type, as Emirates has seemingly lined up its replacement with a variety of aircraft, namely the Airbus A350, Boeing 787 Dreamliner, and the yet-to-be-certified Boeing 777X.

“With the [Boeing 777 – ed. note] X gradually slipping in to replace the A380s that eventually go and retire, we will have a leaner, very fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly network that will probably be 30% larger in terms of cities served,” commented Clark on the Super Jumbo’s replacement during CAPA Live event in February 2021.

Currently, out of 119 Emirates’ Airbus A380 aircraft, 90 are parked due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Planespotters.net data shows.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9985752105712891}",neutral,0.9985752105712891,0
Airbus Helicopters and US Coast Guard celebrate 40-year partnership - AirMed and Rescue Magazine,"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcm1lZGFuZHJlc2N1ZS5jb20vbGF0ZXN0L25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLWFuZC11cy1jb2FzdC1ndWFyZC1jZWxlYnJhdGUtNDAteWVhci1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus – Aerospatiale at the time – won the USCG contract for nearly 100 MH-65 Dauphin helicopters for short-range recovery missions in 1979. It was the beginning of a new era for the small north Texas aviation company. Supporting any large fleet of this size is an undertaking, and supporting the nearly 100 MH-65 helicopters still flying today – the first of which was delivered in 1984 – presents no shortage of logistical and component challenges.

To help support the through-life objectives of the USCG, Airbus Helicopters recently renewed its commitment to support their fleet through a 10-year sustaining contract, with the goal of improving spare parts availability and planning and providing increased Airbus support. The contract includes dedicated personnel, training, and technical publications.

Upgrading the fleet of MH-65s

Airbus Helicopters has also been working with the Coast Guard to upgrade the existing fleet of MH-65s with a digital avionics suite, major structural modifications and new electrical wiring throughout the aircraft. These modifications will help prolong the aircraft’s service life beyond 2035.

“We are proud of our decades-long partnership with the Coast Guard and honored to support a team who flies 24/7, often in treacherous conditions, with the ultimate goal of saving lives and protecting our nation,” said Anthony Baker, Vice President of Customer Support at Airbus Helicopters.

A total of eight Airbus Helicopters personnel in the US and France are dedicated to the new support contract, including two employees on-site at the Coast Guard’s facility in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, US.

“Supporting the Coast Guard is among our very top priorities at Airbus Helicopters,” Baker said. “They’ve committed to being ‘always ready’ to support those in need in sea or on land, and we’re putting in place the necessary steps so we can remain ready to support them when they need us.”

In March, Airbus Helicopters handed over the seventh and last H145 for the search and rescue service of the Bundeswehr to the Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support in Germany.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9827092885971069}",neutral,0.9827092885971069,0

The end: Malaysia Airlines to sell its Airbus A380 fleet - AeroTime,"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjgzOTAtbWFsYXlzaWEtYWlybGluZXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtZmxlZXTSAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZXJvdGltZS5hZXJvL2FydGljbGVzLzI4MzkwLW1hbGF5c2lhLWFpcmxpbmVzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLWZsZWV0L2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"While the pandemic keeps taking its toll on international air travel, airlines are reviewing the future of their widebody aircraft. The status of the Airbus A380 was under question even before the pandemic. But the current health crisis was just enough for some operators to single-handedly oust the Super Jumbo.

Another airline is joining the ever-growing list of the Airbus A380 former operators. Malaysia Aviation Group (MAG), the parent company of national air carrier Malaysia Airlines, launched a tender for the sale of its six Airbus A380s or their components on July 15, 2021. Interested parties are invited to send their proposals by August 12, 2021.

Earlier in 2021, Malaysia Aviation Group (MAG) underwent a restructuring process. Following the completion of its restructuring in May 2021, the airline revealed that it was exploring ways to dispose of its Airbus A380.

The Malaysia Aviation Group (MAG) reorganized its business so that the Airbus A380 no longer fitted its future plans. Now, the airline group is positioning itself as a global travel group and expanding beyond the airline business.

“We are cognizant of the challenges to sell this aeroplane, but we are still looking at ways and means to dispose of our 380 fleet,” Group Chief Executive Captain Izham Ismail said in May 2021 as quoted by Reuters. “At the moment, the management is convinced that the 380 doesn’t fit the future plan.”

Currently, the airline’s Airbus A380 fleet is still parked and waiting for its buyer at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KUL), Malaysia. The average age of the airline’s six Super Jumbos stands at 9.2 years old, as per Planespotters.net data.

Malaysia Airlines – eighth operator of the Super Jumbo

In total, only 15 airlines in the world operated the Airbus widebody. Malaysia Airlines happened to become the eighth airline to operate the Super Jumbo and the seventh to drop it.

Malaysia Airlines took delivery of its first Airbus A380 on May 29, 2012. Powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines, the aircraft featured a three class layout, with capabilities to seat up a total of 494 passengers. Features included fully flat beds in first and business class. The airline ordered six double-deckers. The other five A380s were delivered in 2012 and 2013.

“This will be our flagship aircraft, offering new levels of comfort, luxury and convenience for long haul travel,” Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, the former MAS Group Chief Executive Officer, said at the time. “With the A380 in our fleet, MAS will reinforce its position as one of the world’s preferred premium carriers bringing great Malaysian Hospitality to our customers.”

In 2013, Malaysia Aviation Group and Airbus together marked a major achievement with the hand-over of the 100th A380 to Malaysia Airlines at Airbus’ Henri Ziegler Delivery Centre in Toulouse, France. The aircraft carrying the “100th A380” sticker, registered as 9M-MNF, was the last to join Malaysia Airlines’ Airbus A380 fleet.

“We are delighted that our 100th A380 delivery is to Malaysia Airlines as this gives us an early glimpse into the future shape of aviation,” said Fabrice Brégier, the former Airbus President and CEO. “We see a growing demand from dynamic, competitive airlines such as MAS for larger aircraft, with many markets and routes, and in particular in the fast developing Asia-Pacific region, being ideally suited to A380s.”

The long-haul travel demand collapse brought by the pandemic has been especially cruel for the four-engined double-decker. Lufthansa (LHAB) (LHA), Air France, Hi Fly, Etihad Airways, Thai Airways, Qatar Airways, and now Malaysia Airlines said they would discontinue flying the Airbus A380 mainly due to operational inefficiency and costly maintenance. China Southern only hinted about their Super Jumbo fleet retirements. The rest of A380 operators, on the other hand, are in no rush to get rid of the world’s largest passenger aircraft.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998107552528381}",neutral,0.9998107552528381,0

Last Friday we had an opportunity to catch up with Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer. As the global commercial aviation industry starts to climb out from the pandemic, Mr. Scherer is a very busy man and we fortunate to get some time with him.

AirInsight: Christian, thank you so much for spending some time with me. I appreciate it. With the increase in vaccinations and herd immunity, there appears to be light at the end of the tunnel. Emerging from the pandemic, we see changes in airlines’ balance sheet strength, from pathetic to hopefully a little bit recovery. But changes in demand and route structures. So how can Airbus innovate and help its customers post-pandemic?

Scherer: How do we help our customers after the pandemic? Well, the same way we did before the pandemic is the sort of snotty answer. By making sure we have the right products for them now. I do not think that the breadth and the scope of the product options from Airbus, ranging from the 220-100 to the 350-1000, has any fundamental flaws in it after the pandemic, as a result of the pandemic. If anything, our strength, I want to say in the sort of mid-market segments, is a strength. The fact that we have a long-range single-aisle airplane that can take a considerable amount of risk out of international or cross-border destinations is a good thing. The fact of, alongside the big brother A330 is a good thing. And you can change up and down from an A321 to an A330. That’s a good thing. So the product range is probably, post-pandemic, if anything, slightly more relevant than ever before. On the very big airplanes, the very long-range airplanes, the fact that we have the longest-range airplane and that A350-900, 1000 are positioned one notch smaller than the 777s is a good thing. And, then on the bottom end, we have the only new technology small airplane with in the A220. So I think we’re pretty well-positioned.

AirInsight: Right. I’m glad that you answered the way you did because what I noticed from the Orders & Deliveries published yesterday, adding the A321neos and the A220s, 39% of your deliveries this year are just those two airplanes. It’s really an amazing performance because you are in the sweet spot, as you stated.

Scherer: Yeah. It’s a good place to be in. You’re right with the stats. I’m sure you are. The A220 really sits there by itself with the new technology offering. And then most importantly, it’s a bit subdued right now, the long-range segment. The big airplane segment is really dormant, as we all know right now. But the A350, where fuel-burn, for example, matters most is new technology and clean sheet design airplane, up there in that segment. So on the two extremes, I think we’re really, really well positioned. And in the middle where we have the strength of the A320 and A321 if anything through the last few years it materialized even more.

AirInsight: So that as you said, the Airbus product line appears better suited to what airlines are looking for in the near term. Do you see continuing demand growth going from the A320 to A321?

Scherer: If anything, there’s a little bit of a tendency towards the A321. And the reason is that I think the vast majority of airlines around the world have already made the decision to go through from the CEO to the NEO. Or from the NG to the MAX. The vast majority of carriers have already made that decision. So in other words, the next ordering is going to be more of the same, but as airlines continue their pursuit of lowering costs, it’s only natural that you’re going from one module to the stretch module. Because by definition, that’s going to allow you to reduce your unit costs even more. So that’s the phenomenon we’re seeing now, we’re there’s an increasing demand of the proportion, if you like, of A321s.

AirInsight: My next question pertains to the A330. We’ve seen that many of the older A330s, though a fine airplane, have been parked. Is this an opportunity for airlines, and I’m thinking of Delta, for example, where the older A330s and even the 767s are retired. And they move towards the A330neo. While the A330neo is a big improvement, many of the A330s needing replacement are not that old. It’s the same problem Embraer has with the E2 and the E1. Do you think now that so many of the older A330s are being retired, that the time of the A330neo is upon us?

Scherer: It could be. I wouldn’t be that categorical, because I think you’re going to see a number of these A330ceos probably coming back when the international flying resumes. But where I do share your point of view, I would assume is that the A330neo’s heyday has yet to come, because it addresses the replacement in excess of 1,200 A330ceos out there. And so whether that replacement wave is now accelerated slightly by the pandemic and the grounding of existing airplanes or not remains to be seen. Intuitively, you may well be right, but I’m not sure we’ve seen that confirmed just yet. Certainly, the surplus, or the glut if you like, and I won’t deny that of large aircraft makes for a relative depression of rentals of A330ceos, 767s, old 777s, et cetera. And that’s going to make these airplanes quite attractive when demand resumes.

Whether it’s accelerating the replacement wave or it’s just a little blip and the math will normalize, it doesn’t change the fact that the replacement wave is yet to come for the A330neo. And that’s what makes me somewhat bullish on the A330neo, as I sit here. I will confess that, when I took this position, this job three years ago, I’d been away from the commercial scene for a little while. And so I said, oh, the A330neo is kind of a strange positioning. And now that I’ve played around with it and marketed the airplane for three years, it’s really grown on me. It’s a formidable seat cost machine, and a very easy transition and natural step in the direction of more sustainable flying and more comfortable flying. Into a huge market, an embedded market of A330ceos. And now having flown the airplane now, recently a few times, I also, the cynic in me said, okay, it’s just a new A330. No, it’s a brand new airplane. So I’ve become quite fond, I must say, of the A330neo.

AirInsight: One thing that is of great concern, and I’ve heard this from the former Airbus CEO, is about the duopoly being unstable. Given the combination of the MAX crisis and then the pandemic disrupted what was a reasonably stable duopoly, but now the market is substantially tilted in favor of Airbus, particularly the narrow body segment. So on the one hand, what do you do to maintain your advantage? And also, you have to evolve a strategy, really, that defends your market share. But also, how do you deal with what could be a very unstable duopoly?

Scherer: I’m tempted to say that we are in, I don’t want to say in control, that would be presumptuous, but we are masters of our destiny on the single aisles. One, we’ve done a really decent job, I say this modestly, in matching our production levels to our ability to deliver the airplanes into the markets. So when we reduced the production rate of the single aisles, and we did that purely on speculation in March of last year, when we reduced down to 40/month. That turned out to be exactly the right level that we could serve without building inventory, but without delaying aircraft for people who really wanted them. In other words, we found the right balance of supply and demand. That enabled us to maintain the value of these airplanes and hold on, in the case of the A321, actually increase the assessed market value of the A321 throughout the pandemic. And despite the fact that our competitor, for their own unfortunate reasons, has had to discount their products massively. So that’s a convoluted way of saying that the way we try to manage our destiny is by making sure that we maintain the value of our airplanes. And so far, the market is crediting us with that statement. And I think that’s pretty much what I would say there. Did I answer your question?

AirInsight: Yes. One item, what is your view on the stability or instability right now of the duopoly? Do you have any thoughts that you would share?

Scherer: I don’t think that it has to be permanently destabilized. I don’t want to speak for or about my competitor too much, but I think in a duopoly, you’re kind of forced to do that. I think our friends at Boeing are in a pretty terrible spot where they have to make sure that they get the blood flowing through their system again. So they have to get rid of their inventory, they have to spool up to the 737 as quickly as they can. Now, is that something that we can do something about at Airbus? Not really, frankly, because as I told you, we have so vastly matched our production to the demands of our customers that even though the salesman in me would like to have more airplanes to sell and I could sell them with my eyes closed right now, I just don’t have to. So the Boeing situation you have to expect they will do what they have to do to get rid of planes. To finish their garage sale, and then a certain degree of stability will come back into the market.

The A320 and A321, are fly-by-wire, contemporaneous technology airplanes. And because of their embedded technology, and sizing, and market penetration, they do command a premium. Whether it’s in market share and/or price. And so I expect that to continue, but I don’t think the market has been destabilized permanently.

AirInsight: My next item is, Airbus has outlined an environmentally friendly airplane by 2035, including the use of hydrogen. I think a lot of people feel that goal is very aggressive. Do you think over the next two decades, we could actually see alternative fuels to SAF being economically useful and viable?

Scherer: Well, I’m not a technical expert. But I’m old enough to have observed the world. And disruption and innovation are systematically met with skepticism, cynicism, and it is always those who express that skepticism that ends up crying. So that’s a somewhat pretentious general statement. I realized that. But, but I know that hydrogen is technically quite the right avenue to explore, to verify because of its energy density, because of its scalability. The devil is not so much in the technology. Well, I say this very loosely, the devil is not in using hydrogen as a source of energy, the devil is rather more in the distribution system and logistics, production, storage of it. So do I believe, as a member of the Airbus management team, in the feasibility of this? Absolutely. Without that, this company would not have gone so public about its intentions.

And why is that the right idea? Anybody who would deny today that society will embrace solutions – society meaning at large, the population, the policymakers, the technology providers. That society would embrace, at large, propositions to decarbonize and render sustainable anything that’s important for society, would be a fool. So you know it’s the proverbial Kodak situation. Remember, digital photography is not photography. Photography has to be done in a dark room with chemicals and that was what a mere 20 years ago.

I can get really carried away on this and I realize I’m giving you a very general answer, but I want to underline it. I’m more of a business guy or a strategist. So the strategist in me is saying, this is the right path. Why? Because it puts a stake in the ground for something that society wants. Society wants to travel, it wants connectivity, and it wants decarbonization. So one way or another, we’re going to have to address those two necessary wants from society. Point one.

And point two, that’s going to take a whole lot of money, and a whole lot of research, and a whole lot of convergence of interests to do so. And you cannot do that overnight. And that’s why I think the timeframe is about 15 years from now and is the right one. And during those 15 years, my company happens to have the more advanced and therefore more sustainable proposition between now and then. Which is allowing us to generate the cash flows and the profit to be able to invest in this new technology. So this isn’t a publicity stunt. This is, I mean, a calculated strategy based on scientific facts, societal requirements, and business reality.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9984295964241028}",positive,0.9984295964241028,1
Airbus A330 Is Turned Into Giant Stage for Upcoming Desert Rave - autoevolution,"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWEzMzAtaXMtdHVybmVkLWludG8tZ2lhbnQtc3RhZ2UtZm9yLXVwY29taW5nLWRlc2VydC1yYXZlLTE2NTk1NC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Creative recycling is one way to give new life to old, discarded items, reduce waste, and show originality. One Spanish company is putting a very… creative spin on creative recycling.

While it’s not unheard of to repurpose scrapped aircraft , this is probably a first: an Airbus A330 is currently being converted into a giant stage for an upcoming desert rave. It will hold about 1,000 guests and, based on the social media posts of the organizers of the Monegros Desert Festival, it will be a “secret” nightclub. Given how much they’ve been posting about it , so much for it being a secret.The video at the bottom of the page shows the massive fuselage being moved to its new location, from Teruel to Fraga in North-Eastern Spain. This year’s edition of the festival has been canceled for reasons we all know too well (the still-raging international health crisis), but organizers are confident that things will take a turn for the better by August 2022. That’s when the festival is expected to return and, with it, the massive new stage to make its debut.The A330 traveled some 230 km (143 miles) on the highway , before it made it to the desert, Simple Flying notes. Once there, it was put into place by cranes, and will have the wings assembled later. Other modifications that will be done to the aircraft have not been disclosed. That said, the organizers say the aircraft is part of the “Monegros 8.6 Airlines Experience,” which will combine the experience of a nightclub, to that of a recreation area and observation lounge.The same media outlet points that the aircraft most likely chopped up for this purpose is most likely an 18-year old plane that flew for the first time in January 2003 with Qatar Airways. It was later registered with Air Italy and was scrapped in February this year, after 78,328 flight hours over 14,829 flight cycles.It’s now time to get started on an equally glamorous life, back on solid ground.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999761581420898}",neutral,0.9999761581420898,0

While his previous Air Force One had a wingspan of five-and-a-half feet, the new Emirates A380 is seven-foot wide and weighs almost 100 pounds with no external supports. It’s massive and has a lot of great details, which we will get to below.



If your goal is to build the biggest LEGO airplane, you could stop with the exterior; not Jack. He put a lot of work into showcasing all aspects of the A380 from the cockpit to the tail. This view includes the cockpit, first-class seating, and the lounge in the back.

Would you believe that there are two decks? The previous show was the upper deck; this is the lower deck with the economy seating.

The first-class seating takes luxury up a level by including functioning desk lamps in each room.

For an airplane of this size, the cockpit requires four pilots to keep it running.

The seating has necessary repetition, but there are also some fun details, like the full-sized turkey and pie in the kitchen area and the individual screens at each seat.

Here we have a drinking & seating area for the first-class passengers; note the wooden accents used in this area and the variety in drinkware.

Getting back to the outside of the airplane we have what Jack calls, “some of the trickiest bits [that] ended up consuming a large portion of the time spent building this model.” The flaps & spoilers utilize XL motors, linear actuators, and LEGO string to move them.

The landing gear is fully retractable and successfully holds the almost 100-pound airplane.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999895095825195}",neutral,0.9999895095825195,0

ANYWAVES was selected by Airbus Defence and Space to supply the antennas that will provide telecommand and telemetry to the four satellites making up the CO3D constellation (Constellation Optique 3D).

In addition to the CO3D mission, a five-year framework contract formalizes this industrial partnership. For the next similar satellites that Airbus intends to produce, ANYWAVES will provide — “on demand” — the S-band TT&C antennas required to control the platform. Through this contract, ANYWAVES commits to volumes of up to dozens of antennas per order, enabling very ambitious constellations.

In addition to the antennas to be supplied to CO3D, ANYWAVES will also deliver test caps to Airbus Defence and Space. This additional equipment, used at integration time, allows for the check of proper antenna functioning before the final acceptance tests are performed on the platform. For ANYWAVES, winning such a contract is an occasion to confirm the company’s positioning as an antenna equipment manufacturer able to provide a complete range of products.

Through this show of confidence, ANYWAVES’ ability to work fully in line with the biggest companies demands is once again demonstrated. Thanks to this large-scale contract, the French equipment manufacturer, which is aiming for antennas leadership in the satellite constellations market, is one step closer to their goal.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999788999557495}",neutral,0.9999788999557495,0

insight by Mike Stones 28 July 2021 Print this page

Three key markets are driving sustained growth in Airbus Helicopters’ order book, while two operators report a return to near pre-Covid levels of business, according to the recent Helicopter Investor Town Hall online meeting.

Will Fulton, head of Marketing with Airbus Helicopters North America, identified the key markets as airborne law enforcement, private and business aviation and medical transport. “The first one we are seeing from an aircraft replacement standpoint and a capability increase is the airborne law enforcement market,” Fulton told Town Hall delegates.

Last year, the global pandemic put replacement budgets “under strain”, as funds were relocated to cope with Covid-19. “Now, in 2021, we see this market coming back,” he said. “They are not cancelling these enquiries, they are actively level setting and we are seeing more bookings and orders happening earlier in the year, which is exciting for us.”

In the OEM’s private and business helicopter sector, customers’ growing interest in avoiding commercial travel helped to blunt the impact of the pandemic. “Even last year, this sector [private and business aviation] was able to sustain itself,” said Fulton. “Enquiries grew, which was probably driven a lot by travel autonomy and [the need] to be able to go where these corporations and private individuals wanted to go, when they wanted to get there.”

A key trend this year was interest from new entrants to the market – particularly in the company’s twin engine H145 helicopter, which has gained full FAA certification, he added.

The other big sector for Airbus is the air medical segment. “In North America, there are a couple of very larger players,” said Fulton. “As their aircraft age, we are looking for advanced capacity growth with those replacement strategies.”

Airbus was benefiting not just from replacement growth, Fulton said. “We are seeing market growth, with the opening of new helicopter bases, beyond pre-Covid levels, with utility [sector] also picking up.” But it was the main three sectors – private and business aviation, law enforcement and helicopter emergency medical services (EMS) – that “rotated around” in importance.

‘Opening of new helicopter bases’

The prospect of new helicopter sales was welcomed by Emmanuel Dupuy, president of helicopter broker and Town Hall sponsor Aero Asset. “I’m excited about Airbus looking to sell a lot more EMS and VIP aircraft in the near term,” said Dupuy, who hosted the Town Hall. “It probably means that some pre-owned machines will be entering the market. And, as a pre-owned sales specialist, that’s very good for us.”

More good news came from Francesco Lazzarini, chief operating officer with North American operator HeliFlite. “The VIP segment for the north east [of America] has definitely bounced back. We are experiencing 90% of what [business] we were seeing in 2019. We also see that in aircraft sales when it comes to helping our clients.” Lazzarini reported that the uptick in business seen at the end of last year – due to US fiscal policy – is continuing this year. “This is true for state-of-the-art equipment in two types – the AW139 for the standard VIP corporate mission and the DH145 for the VIP and yacht mission.”

Andrew Collins, president and CEO of Sentient Jet, estimated his company’s rotorcraft business had returned to 75% to 85% of pre-Covid levels. Revenue hours in the north east of the US had been impacted by poor weather. Also, the business was highly seasonal in nature.

But Collins remained optimistic about the longer-term prospects for both helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. “I’m bullish on both [aircraft types]. The fixed wing sector is jumping ahead and you are starting to see fixed wing business increase in Europe [as well as the US]. We probably have a good solid 12 months of demand generation and capacity usage about to occur in both sectors [fixed wind and rotorcraft].”

‘A good solid 12 months of demand generation’

Lazzarini, from HeliFlite, predicted next year would see a full return to the business patterns established before Covid-19. “In the longer term, 2022 and beyond, we are going to regain the growth curve that we have been on for the past four, five or six years,” he said. “That will see high single digit growth to low double digit growth year-on-year in flight hours and corresponding revenues.”

Aero Asset’s vice president of Sales Will Sturm told Town Hall delegates the company’s recent second quarter Heli Market Trends report revealed 15% stronger pre-owned twin engine helicopter sales volume in the first half of 2021. Inventory shrank as the supply of helicopters for sale fell by 10% year-on-year. Light twin engine retail sales soared by nearly 40% in the first two quarters of 2021 and medium twin sales by 25%. But heavy helicopter sales slumped.

North America led transaction volumes accounting for half of global preowned twin engine helicopter transactions in the first half of this year, said Sturm. VIP configured helicopter sales volume saw an increase of 40% year-on-year.

Lazzarini, from HeliFlite, summed up on a philosophical note: “It looked as if the world was going to end [at the start of the global pandemic]. But it just fell asleep for five minutes and now seems to be back.”

The Helicopter Investor Town Hall online meeting, sponsored by Aero Asset, took place on Thursday July 15th, 2021. You can watch the meeting here or listen to the podcast here. The latest insights from leading figures in the global helicopter industry will be available from our conference Helicopter Investor London 2021, which takes place on September 28th and 29th.

The news was revealed during the ongoing Moscow air show MAKS-2021 (July 20-25).

All aircraft will feature a single-class cabin layout with 148 seats. The airline, which describes itself as ‘a carrier of the south of Russia’, plans to operate A220s from its bases in Rostov-on-Don, Krasnodar and Mineralnye Vody.

Currently Azimuth operates a mono-type fleet of fifteen 100 seat Superjet 100s, including eight in SSJ100LR long-range version.

Russian Aviation Insider first learned that the airline is interested in the bigger aircraft in 2019. With almost 50 per cent more capacity and range of 6,390 km (versus SSJ100LR’s 4,200 km ) the A220 is not competing with Superjet, Azimuth’s general director Pavel Ekzhanov insists. Instead, the new type provides Azimuth with an opportunity to expand to more domestic destinations, including flights to Siberia and international routes to the CIS, Middle East and European destinations.

In the meantime the airline proceeds with its SSJ100 fleet expansion plans. Azimuth has committed to Russian-made regional jets by singing Letter of Intent at MAKS for ten more SSJs to be delivered until 2026.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999978542327881}",neutral,0.9999978542327881,0
