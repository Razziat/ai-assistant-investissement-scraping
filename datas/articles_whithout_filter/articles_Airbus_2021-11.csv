Airbus A340 plane lands on Antarctica for first time - CNN,"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvZmlyc3QtYWlyYnVzLWEzNDAtcGxhbmUtYW50YXJjdGljYS1pbnRsLWhuay9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFSaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvZmlyc3QtYWlyYnVzLWEzNDAtcGxhbmUtYW50YXJjdGljYS1pbnRsLWhuaw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

For the first time in history, an Airbus A340 plane has landed on Antarctica.

Hi Fly, a boutique aviation company, was behind the flight. The company specializes in wet leases, which means they hire out both aircraft and air crew and are responsible for handling insurance, maintenance and other logistics.

Hi Fly 801 took off from Cape Town, South Africa on Tuesday, November 2.

The plane was commissioned by Wolf’s Fang, a new upscale adventure camp on the world’s southernmost continent, and brought much-needed supplies to the resort. Wolf’s Fang is a new project from high-end Antarctica tourism company White Desert.

The crew of Hi Fly 801 (and its return trip to Cape Town, Hi Fly 802) was led by Captain Carlos Mirpuri, who is also Hi Fly’s vice president.

Each flight took between five and five and a half hours, and the team spent less than three hours on the ground in Antarctica, covering 2,500 nautical miles.

The blue-ice runway at the Wolf’s Fang property is designated a C Level airport, despite not technically being an airport. That means that only highly specialized crew can fly there due to challenging conditions.

“The cooler it is the better,” Mipuri explained in his captain’s log.

“Grooving is carved along the runway by special equipment, and after cleaning and carving we get an adequate braking coefficient; the runway being 3,000 meters long, landing and stopping an A340 that heavy on that airfield wouldn’t be a problem.”

Although the blue ice is gorgeous, it can also be concerning for pilots because of its glare.

Mipuri added: “The reflection is tremendous, and proper eyewear helps you adjust your eyes between the outside view and the instrumentation. The non-flying pilot has an important role in making the usual plus extra callouts, especially in the late stages of the approach.”

The first recorded flight to Antarctica was a Lockheed Vega 1 monoplane in 1928, piloted by George Hubert Wilkins, an Australian military pilot and explorer. He took off from Deception Island in the South Shetland Islands. The project was funded by William Randolph Hearst, the wealthy American publishing tycoon.

Short exploratory flights like these were how scientists and mapmakers got vital information about Antarctica’s topography.

To this day, there is no airport on the White Continent, but there are 50 landing strips and runways.

Australia and South Africa are just two of the global powers with interests in Antarctica.

As aviation website Simple Flying notes, the Russian Antarctic research station organized a half-dozen trial flights to their 3,000-foot blue ice runway between 2019 and 2020. Those were carried out by wide-body aircrafts as well.

Since the vast majority of people get to the White Continent via ship, seeing the A340 landing on an ice runway is certainly dramatic – and means there will likely be more such landings in the future."
Airbus and its partners demonstrate how sharing the skies can save airlines fuel and reduce CO2 emissions - Airbus,"Tue, 09 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0xMS1haXJidXMtYW5kLWl0cy1wYXJ0bmVycy1kZW1vbnN0cmF0ZS1ob3ctc2hhcmluZy10aGUtc2tpZXMtY2FuLXNhdmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse/Montreal, 09 November 2021 – Airbus has performed the first long-haul demonstration of formation flight in general air traffic (GAT) regulated transatlantic airspace with two A350 aircraft flying at three kilometers apart from Toulouse, France to Montreal, Canada. The aircraft were greeted at Montreal-Trudeau International Airport. Over 6 tons of CO2 emissions were saved on the trip, confirming the potential for more than a 5% fuel saving on long-haul flights.

The “final demonstration” test flight took place on 9 November 2021 involving two A350 test aircraft, MSN1 and MSN59, the former as the leader aircraft and the latter as the follower. This was made possible with flight control systems developed by Airbus which position the follower aircraft safely in the wake updraft of the leader aircraft allowing it to reduce engine thrust and reduce fuel consumption. A similar principle can be observed with large migrating birds such as geese, which fly together in a distinct V-shaped formation.

Sabine Klauke, Chief Technical Officer at Airbus declared: “This demonstration flightis a concrete example of our commitment to making our decarbonisation roadmap a reality. It also speaks to how collaboration across the industry will be key to making this happen. We have received a strong level of support for this project from our airline and air traffic partners, plus regulators. The opportunity to get this deployed for passenger aircraft around the middle of this decade is very promising. Imagine the potential if fello’fly was deployed across the industry!”

Pilots from Airbus partner airlines SAS Scandinavian Airlines and Frenchbee witnessed the transatlantic flight onboard as observers. The flight was made possible by Airbus and its air traffic management partners and navigation service providers (DSNA, NATS, NAV CANADA, Eurocontrol and IAA), with the support of the DGAC, who together proved that wake energy retrieval flight technology leveraged in a fello’fly flight can be achieved without compromising safety. The demonstration also shows how fello’fly operations could significantly boost environmental performance of commercial aircraft and contribute to the aviation industry’s decarbonisation targets in the immediate term.

The next step is to get the support of the authorities so that this new operational concept can be certified, and ultimately enable airlines to reduce their fuel burn and CO2 emissions.

The Airbus pioneering fello’fly flight was welcomed upon its arrival in Montreal by the Council President and Secretary General of the UN aviation agency, ICAO. Council President Salvatore Sciacchitano said the demonstration represented “an inspiring example of the level of current commitment to reduce aviation emissions,” while ICAO Secretary General Juan Carlos Salazar remarked on how it reflected “the incredible diversity of air transport innovations now being realized to meet the sector’s targets and ensure flying becomes more and more sustainable.”

Launched in 2019, fello’fly is a flight demonstrator project hosted within Airbus UpNext using biomimicry (the design and production of materials, structures and systems inspired by nature). Airbus UpNext is a wholly-owned Airbus subsidiary and part of the Airbus innovation ecosystem, created to give future technologies a development fast-track by building demonstrators at speed and scale, in order to evaluate, mature and validate potential new products and services that encompass radical technological breakthroughs.

Airbus foresees demand for 39000 new passenger & freighter aircraft by 2040 - Airbus,"Sat, 13 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0xMS1haXJidXMtZm9yZXNlZXMtZGVtYW5kLWZvci0zOTAwMC1uZXctcGFzc2VuZ2VyLWZyZWlnaHRlci1haXJjcmFmdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Retirement of older aircraft to accelerate, demand progressively more driven by replacement, supporting the industry’s decarbonisation objectives

Demand for air transport will continue to grow, driven by GDP, rising middle class and desire to explore and connect

Continued improvements in fleet efficiency, sustainable fuels, operations and propulsion technologies will enable the sector’s 2050 net-zero objective

Need for over 550,000 new pilots and over 710,000 highly skilled technicians over the next 20 years

Dubai, 13 November 2021 – In the next 20 years, Airbus forecasts demand for air transport to progressively shift from fleet growth to the accelerated retirement of older, less fuel-efficient aircraft, resulting in a need for some 39,000 new-build passenger and freighter aircraft, 15,250 of these for replacement. As a consequence, by 2040 the vast majority of commercial aircraft in operation will be of the latest generation, up from some 13% today, considerably improving the CO2 efficiency of the world’s commercial aircraft fleets. The economic benefits of aviation extend beyond the sector, contributing around 4% to annual global GDP and sustaining some 90 million jobs worldwide.

While having lost nearly two years of growth over the COVID period, passenger traffic has demonstrated its resilience and is set to reconnect to an annual growth of 3.9% per year, driven by expanding economies and commerce around the globe including tourism. The middle classes, who are the likeliest to fly, will grow in number by two billion people to 63% of the world’s population. The fastest traffic growth will be in Asia with domestic China becoming the largest market.

The demand for new aircraft will include around 29,700 Small aircraft like the A220 and A320 Families, as well as about 5,300 in the Medium aircraft category such as the A321XLR and the A330neo. In the Large segment, covered by the A350, a need for some 4,000 deliveries is expected by 2040.

Cargo demand, boosted by e-commerce, is driven by an expected growth in express freight of 4.7% per year and a general cargo (representing about 75% of the market) growth of 2.7%. Overall, over the next 20 years there will be a need for some 2,440 freighters, of which 880 will be new-build.

In line with growth, ever more efficient aircraft operations globally increase the need for commercial aviation services - including maintenance, training, upgrades, flight operations, dismantling and recycling. This growth is on track at Airbus’ pre-pandemic forecast levels reaching a cumulative value of around $4.8Tn in the next 20 years. While continuing through a COVID-related downdip of some 20% over the 2020-2025 period, the services market is rebounding, triggering a need for some 550,000+ new pilots and 710,000+ highly skilled technicians over the next 20 years. While maintenance will remain the leading services segment, flight, ground operations and sustainable services are also expected to grow significantly.

“As economies and air transport mature, we see demand increasingly driven by replacement rather than growth. Replacement being today’s most significant driver for decarbonisation. The world is expecting more sustainable flying and this will be made possible in the short-term by the introduction of most modern airplanes,” said Christian Scherer, Chief Commercial Officer and Head of Airbus International. “Powering these new, efficient aircraft with Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) is the next big lever. We pride ourselves that all our aircraft - the A220, A320neo Family, the A330neo and the A350 - are already certified to fly with a blend of 50% SAF, set to rise to 100% by 2030 - before making ZEROe our next reality from 2035 onwards.”

The global aviation industry has already achieved huge efficiency gains, as shown by the 53% decline in aviation’s CO2 emissions per revenue passenger kilometre since 1990. Airbus’ product range supports at least a 20% CO2 efficiency gain over previous-generation aircraft. In view of further ongoing innovations, product developments, operational improvements as well as market based options, Airbus is supporting the air transport sector’s target to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Thales and Diehl join Airbus to develop flight control computers for CityAirbus NextGen - Airbus,"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0xMS10aGFsZXMtYW5kLWRpZWhsLWpvaW4tYWlyYnVzLXRvLWRldmVsb3AtZmxpZ2h0LWNvbnRyb2wtY29tcHV0ZXJz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Cologne, 17 November 2021 – Airbus has signed a trilateral agreement with Thales and Diehl Aerospace for the joint development of the flight control computers of CityAirbus NextGen. The central flight control system of CityAirbus NextGen, the electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle (eVTOL) being developed by Airbus, will combine extraordinary computing power with lightweight design and highest safety standards.

Diehl and Thales are joining Airbus in investing into the emerging eVTOL market. Both partners are developing their own system that will be integrated into a dissimilar architecture to comply with the new EASA regulation for eVTOL. This architecture is essential to ensuring the redundancy of the computers and the vehicle’s safety. The developments will be supported with public funding from the German and French governments, respectively.

Thales is responsible for the primary computing system, while Diehl is developing the secondary flight control computer. The system ensures that the second, independent flight control computer monitors the data of the primary computer system permanently, and it can also take over the flight control itself.

“I'm delighted to announce today the first system partnership for the development of our CityAirbus NextGen” said Jörg Müller, Head of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) at Airbus. “UAM is a joint effort. Nobody can do it alone. Airbus is reaching out to potential partners from the industry to design and build an optimised vehicle for safe and efficient air transport in urban environments. With Thales and Diehl, we are proud to have two excellent partners with a lot of expertise on board.”

“In the future, eVTOLs will be a key part of mobility and will enormously enrich it – in our cities but also beyond. For this, the safe operation of the innovative aircraft, of course, plays an essential role”, said Josef Köcher, CEO at Diehl Aviation. “We see a trend-setting partnership in the close collaboration with Airbus and Thales for the reliability and safety of the CityAirbus. We are proud to be on board with our expertise, and we are looking forward to seeing the CityAirbus in the skies soon.”

""We are thrilled to see that our close cooperation with Airbus and Diehl is once again delivering concrete results through an agreement that will add a whole new dimension to air mobility,"" said Yannick Assouad, Thales Executive Vice President, Avionics. ""With this safe and innovative flight control solution, we are working together to build an airspace environment we can all trust.""

Thales has more than 40 years of experience in electrical flight controls, having supplied the systems for the first ever fly-by-wire commercial airliner, the Airbus A310. Diehl Aerospace, a joint venture of the French partner Thales and Diehl Aviation, has many decades of experience in avionics for civil and military aircraft and helicopters.

The fully electric CityAirbus NextGen was revealed in September 2021 at the Airbus Summit.

Zephyr High Altitude Platform Station (HAPS) achieves connectivity in trial conducted by Airbus and NTT DOCOMO - Airbus,"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0xMS16ZXBoeXItaGlnaC1hbHRpdHVkZS1wbGF0Zm9ybS1zdGF0aW9uLWhhcHMtYWNoaWV2ZXMtY29ubmVjdGl2aXR5LWlu0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The companies demonstrated the feasibility of providing communication services from the stratosphere to smartphones

Data transmissions across various speeds up to a distance of 140km were successfully demonstrated

TOKYO, JAPAN, November 15, 2021 – Airbus and NTT DOCOMO, INC. have demonstrated the ability to use its solar-powered Zephyr High Altitude Platform Station (HAPS) to deliver future wireless broadband connectivity. The trial took place in the United States in August, when the Zephyr S aircraft undertook approx. 18-day stratospheric flights to test various capabilities.

Carrying an onboard radio transmitter, the Zephyr S provided an agile datalink during a stratospheric flight to simulate future direct-to-device connectivity. Test data was captured at different altitudes and at different times of day and night, focusing on assessing how connectivity is affected in the stratosphere by factors including weather conditions, different elevation angles and aircraft flight patterns.

Tests included various bandwidths to simulate direct-to-device service from the HAPS to end users using low, nominal and high throughput. The demonstration confirmed the viability and versatility of the 2GHz spectrum for HAPS-based services and also the use of a narrow (450MHz) band to provide connectivity in a range of up to 140km.

The measurement and analysis of the propagation of radio waves transmitted from Zephyr demonstrated the feasibility of stratospheric communications to devices such as smartphones. Based on the results of this experiment, Airbus and NTT DOCOMO aims to provide communication services to mountainous areas, remote islands, and maritime areas where radio waves are difficult to reach.

""DOCOMO believes that HAPS will be a promising solution for coverage expansion in 5G evolution and 6G,” said Takehiro Nakamura, General Manager of DOCOMO's 6G-IOWN Promotion Department. “In this measurement experiment, we were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of HAPS, especially for direct communication to smartphones, through long-term propagation measurements using actual HAPS equipment. Based on these results, we would like to further study the practical application of HAPS in 5G evolution and 6G with Airbus.”

As part of efforts to further advance 5G and prepare for 6G, ""coverage expansion"" to expand communication networks to any location, including air and sea, is being studied worldwide. To achieve this, non-terrestrial network (NTN) technology is expected to be used. In addition to coverage of the air and sea, stratospheric HAPS networking will be useful for disaster preparedness and many industrial use cases, for example, to increase communication capacity in densely populated areas such as event venues, and remotely controlling heavy equipment at construction sites.

The test data will be used to inform future LTE direct-to-device services that are expected to be provided via the Airbus Zephyr HAPS solution.

“Billions of people across the world suffer from poor or no connectivity. These tests show us the viability of the stratosphere to bridge this divide and provide direct to device connectivity via Zephyr without the need for base stations or extra infrastructure,” Stephane Ginoux, Head of North Asia region for Airbus and President of Airbus Japan K.K.

Test details

The trial involved a radio propagation experiment from the stratosphere at an altitude of approximately 20 kilometers to a receiving antenna on the ground. Tests involved a direct connection between the radio equipment on board a Zephyr S HAPS aircraft flying in the stratosphere and the ground antenna under conditions of ever-changing altitude and day/night time.

The trial tested the stability of the connection between the Zephyr S HAPS and the ground antenna and how it was affected by factors such as weather conditions, differences in reception distance, and the flight pattern of the HAPS aircraft. As a result, under three specific scenarios: clear, rainy and cloudy conditions, and in a multitude of flight patterns, data transmissions across various speeds were successfully demonstrated, up to a distance of 140km.

Airbus meets customer request for vegan helicopter interior - Airbus,"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0xMS1haXJidXMtbWVldHMtY3VzdG9tZXItcmVxdWVzdC1mb3ItdmVnYW4taGVsaWNvcHRlci1pbnRlcmlvctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Dubai, 16 November 2021 – When a valued customer specified that his new helicopter must have an interior that was fully vegan, Airbus Corporate Helicopters’ (ACH) design team rose to the occasion.

The resulting ACH145 has now been delivered to German construction entrepreneur Dr Urs Brunner who insisted on the requirement at the urging of his wife, ethical fashion pioneer Daniela Brunner.

Its cabin is fitted with ACH’s clean and modern ACH Line interior configuration in a grey theme but the leather elements essential to its luxury feel are replaced with Ultraleather which captures the visual and tactile leather experience with comparable durability.

Items that had to be specially designed and fabricated in the replacement material include the six passenger seats, central storage cabinet, rear partition and cockpit controls cuffs.

Ms Brunner, founding owner of specialist fashion house Giulia & Romeo, which has no animal products involved in its range and donates all its profits to animal welfare, wanted the helicopter to be consistent with her ethical values.

Head of ACH, Frederic Lemos, said: “We’re very proud of our team’s work in creating this bespoke ACH Line interior. The material that we used is certified for aviation use and is hard wearing, but it can only be stretched in one direction which means it is a challenge to work with, particularly on the seats.

“This is where the craftsmanship of our hands-on team became crucial and I am delighted to say that we found a practical way to meet our customer’s desires which also looks superb.”

Dr Brunner, an experienced helicopter and fixed-wing pilot, said: “We both greatly appreciate the skill and imagination that went into devising and installing this interior.”

This chase aircraft is tracking 100% SAF's emissions performance - Airbus,"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLTExLXRoaXMtY2hhc2UtYWlyY3JhZnQtaXMtdHJhY2tpbmctMTAwLXNhZnMtZW1pc3Npb25zLXBlcmZvcm1hbmNl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The latest test flight of an A350 operating on 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has mobilised DLR’s Falcon 20E to capture and analyse in-flight data. Flying within 100 metres during the test campaign, the two aircraft are already delivering invaluable insight, the preliminary observations of which point to the positive impact of SAF on aircraft emissions.

The aerial dance of DLR’s Falcon 20E and #A350 operating on 100% SAF show more show less Watch as DLR’s Falcon 20E gets within 100 metres of this #A350 operating on unblended sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Soaring among the clouds above the south of France, the flight test campaign captured valuable in-flight data of SAF’s emissions performance.

On this pleasant spring day, the sky is a welcoming blue as an A350 glides through the fluffy white clouds above the South of France.

Then, suddenly, a smaller aircraft ascends rapidly into view, taking up position just behind the A350. As the larger, commercial jet twists and turns across the sky, its smaller companion mirrors its every move, getting as close as 100 metres away – an intimate airborne dance that is rarely seen.

The aerial two-step continues for about three hours, as the two aircraft weave in and out of the clouds above Nice, Marseille and Corsica. Then, just as suddenly as they joined up in the air, the two aircraft part ways and fly off in different directions.

Soon, the A350 touches down in Toulouse, France at Blagnac airport. A bright orange logo, emblazoned with the words “Flight Lab,” is clearly visible on its tail. This particular aircraft is, in fact, an Airbus test aircraft. And more importantly, it has just completed a noteworthy test flight as part of the Emission and Climate Impact of Alternative Fuels (ECLIF3) project led by Airbus, together with Rolls-Royce, DLR, Neste, the UK’s University of Manchester and the National Research Council of Canada.

Indeed, this A350 has the distinction of having operated both of its jet engines on 100% SAF. This time, it is the emissions coming out of the aircraft that are of most interest. And this is precisely where the smaller, ‘chase’ aircraft comes in.

We can test the engines and the fuel system on the ground, but to gather the full emissions data necessary for this programme to be successful, there's only one way to do that and it’s to fly a real aircraft in real conditions.

Mark Lewis, Airbus Test Pilot

Capturing in-flight emissions data: the chase is on

A chase aircraft is an aircraft that follows an airborne subject to make real-time observations, capture images during flight or collect engineering data. This type of in-flight testing has been in use since the 1960s, a technique pioneered by NASA and the United States Air Force.

For the ECLIF3 project, DLR’s modified Dassault Falcon 20E-5 plays the starring role as the chaser aircraft. The Falcon can carry a total of 1,100 kg of scientific instruments inside and outside the cabin, as well as under the wings. It is robust and versatile, capable of flying close to thunderstorms or just 30 metres behind powerful jets like the A350. First introduced in 1976, the Falcon has become a crucial vehicle through which to better understand the effects of aircraft emissions on our atmosphere.

Now, the DLR Falcon’s mission is to measure emissions from an A350 test aircraft powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines fuelled with 100% SAF. Unlike today’s SAF blends, this unblended type is not mixed with any fossil fuels. Analysing its behaviour and performance in real-world scenarios is crucial to achieving future certification. And the Falcon is equipped to do just that: its multiple probes and sensors can capture emissions data and feed it into on-board scientific instrumentation for analysis.

“We can test the engines and the fuel system on the ground,” says Mark Lewis, Airbus Test Pilot. “But to gather the emissions data necessary for this programme to be successful, there's only one way to do that and it’s to fly a real aircraft in real conditions.”

Early results show promise

In-flight testing of the A350 offers the advantage of characterising direct and indirect engine emissions. These emissions include particulates, as well as contrails – clouds of ice crystals that can form behind an aircraft at high altitude.

According to Toby Wells, Airbus’ Head of Future Fuels, preliminary observations from the test flight with the chase aircraft suggest unblended SAF can have a positive impact on aircraft emissions.

“As we predicted, the particulate emissions of the aircraft were lower when using the 100% SAF,” he says. “These particulates play a role in the formation of contrails, which contribute to aviation’s climate impact, so we’re pleased to have a solution to address those emissions.”

Toby underscores there is still a lot more data to analyse to gain a full understanding of unblended SAF’s emissions performance. However, initial results are indeed very promising.

Findings from the study are first expected to be published towards the end of next year"

The 1,700-square-meter facility offers training to Airbus operators in Chile and houses a full-suite of A320 pilot training equipment and has the capacity for 1,800 trainees a year. SKY, an all-Airbus low cost carrier based in Chile and Peru, selected Airbus in 2019 as its flight training provider, with the aim of delivering the best safety conditions for its passengers.

The centre was inaugurated with the presence of the Chilean Minister of Transportation and Telecommunications, Gloria Hutt, SKY’s Executive President, Holger Paulmann and Arturo Barreira, President of Airbus Latin America and the Caribbean.

The A320 Family is the world’s most popular single-aisle aircraft family as it is the preferred choice with airlines, from the low cost carriers, to new business models taking benefits of new levels of performance and comfort, and with passengers. As air traffic in Latin America is progressively ramping up, Airbus predicts that this will call for more than 5,500 pilots to be trained over the next few years in the region, so the new training center will support the actual and the future growth of Airbus customers.

The ACTC is part of the Airbus global flight training network, which has 20 training locations around the world. This extensive and growing global network enables Airbus to offer a complete flight training package, allowing its customers to benefit from its training expertise closer to their home base.

Airbus has sold over 1,100 aircraft and has a backlog of close to 430 and more than 685 in operation throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, representing almost 60% market share of the in-service fleet. Since 1994, Airbus has secured approximately 70 percent of net orders in the region.

First Airbus helicopter flight with 100% sustainable aviation fuel - Airbus,"Tue, 09 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0xMS1maXJzdC1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlci1mbGlnaHQtd2l0aC0xMDAtc3VzdGFpbmFibGUtYXZpYXRpb24tZnVlbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Marignane, 9 November 2021– An Airbus H225 has performed the first ever helicopter flight with 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) powering one of the Safran Makila 2 engines. The flight, which took place at the company’s headquarters in Marignane, marks the start of a flight campaign aiming to assess the impact of unblended SAF on the helicopter systems in view of certifying the use of SAF blends that exceed today’s 50% limit.

“While all Airbus helicopters are certified to fly with up to a 50% blend of SAF mixed with kerosene, it is our Company’s ambition to have its helicopters certified to fly with 100% SAF within the decade. Today’s flight is an important first step towards this goal”, said Stefan Thome, Executive Vice President, Engineering and Chief Technical Officer, Airbus Helicopters.

The flight campaign, which follows earlier unblended SAF bench tests performed by Safran Helicopter Engines at its Bordes plant, will provide further understanding of the technical challenges associated with the use of 100% SAF. The H225 test helicopter flew with an unblended SAF derived from used cooking oil, provided by TotalEnergies, which offers a net 90% CO2 reduction compared to regular jet fuel.

“SAF is an important pillar of Airbus Helicopters’ decarbonisation strategy because it provides immediate CO2 reduction with no negative impact on the performance of the helicopter,” Thome added. “I thank our partners Safran Helicopter Engines and TotalEnergies for their important collaboration in making today’s flight a reality. Further cooperation among all industry stakeholders is essential to overcome the challenges associated with implementing SAF widely and to make real progress in reducing the aviation industry’s CO2 emissions”.

In order to drive the deployment of biofuels, Airbus Helicopters has launched a SAF User Group dedicated to the rotary-wing community. The company has also started using SAF for training and test flights at its French and German sites.

What Went Wrong With The Airbus A380? - Aviation Week,"Sat, 13 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9zaG93bmV3cy9kdWJhaS1haXJzaG93L3doYXQtd2VudC13cm9uZy1haXJidXMtYTM4MNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The last Airbus A380 ever produced is slated to be handed over to Emirates imminently. The delivery will close one of the most spectacular chapters in European aerospace history.

It was spectacular in many ways: The A380 was the largest commercial aircraft ever produced, intended to eclipse Boeing’s 747; passengers and pilots loved its comfort and ease of flying, even if airline finance departments were less enamored with it. The aircraft’s production run, spanning just 14 years, was drama-filled, including the expensive redesign of its wings and increasingly desperate campaigns to sell more of the giant aircraft and extend its life. They were full of negotiations about even larger versions and Neos, after the reengining concept had worked so well for the A320 family.

But after Emirates finally pulled the plug on a large follow-up order that would have saved the program in the winter of 2018, it was up to departing Airbus CEO Tom Enders to finally decide the ending for the A380. It had become clear that Airbus would never recover the €25 billon ($30 billion) or so in research and development costs sunk into the program over the years. And with no new orders keeping production open even at minimal rates, it became unsustainable. Europe’s most ambitious commercial aircraft program post-Concorde had become a gigantic failure and a prime example of management reading the market improperly.

Was it a misreading, though? Was there ever a chance of it continuing until demand recovery?

In the weeks before that final delivery, Aviation Week ShowNews spoke with many insiders who shared their views and memories. Among them were Enders and former Airbus sales chief John Leahy as well as Nico Buchholz, himself a former Airbus sales executive who later ordered the aircraft for Lufthansa as its head of fleet strategy. Some still think the program could have been rescued. But the look back into its history also shows that industry doubts about the A380’s viability had begun even before first delivery.

Paradigm Shift

Enders was head of strategy at Airbus’ German shareholder DASA in the 1990s—the manufacturer was still a loose economic interest group (French acronym GIE), a consortium of shareholders that was nowhere near being integrated. Much later, of course, the A380 was the key factor in fundamentally changing that. In the 1990s, discussions about the risks and opportunities of building an A3XX were intensifying after years of studies. “Airbus did not stumble into [building] the A380; we were very aware of the project’s risks,” Enders says. “But then, technology and the market changed faster than everyone had thought.”

In hindsight, the writing may have been on the wall for the A380 even before its own entry into service—even as early as four years before. In December 2003, Boeing decided to launch the 787, a revolutionary aircraft in many ways, particularly in its use of lightweight composites for structural weight savings. By contrast, “Airbus’ achievement in the A380 was mainly to be able to build something that big,” says Buchholz. Other than that, the A380 was structurally fairly conventional.

Of equal importance was engine manufacturers’ commitment to build powerplants for the Boeing 787 that were significantly better than those of the A380.

The consequences were fundamental: Suddenly, the paradigm of building larger aircraft to cut unit costs was broken. The unit costs of 787—and later the A350—were comparable to or even better than those of the much larger A380, but with a considerably lower risk of not being able to fill the aircraft. Unit revenues were the other side of the coin: There was greater pressure on yields, with literally hundreds of additional seats to fill on every flight. Once Lufthansa started flying the A380 across the Atlantic, the airline found that the yield on its Frankfurt-New York route fell by almost as much as unit costs.

Looking back, Leahy has harsh words for Rolls-Royce and GE Aviation. “Airbus was blindsided by the engine manufacturers in 2000, when we were getting ready to launch it,” he says. “Our program people had assurances [from] the engine OEMs that there was nothing on the horizon with better specific fuel consumption [SFC] for years to come. And three years later, when we had not even delivered the first aircraft, GE and Rolls had engines with 15% better SFCs that they were bringing out for the 787. That left Airbus at a commercial disadvantage that was very unfortunate.”

The aircraft’s most important customer, Emirates Airline President Tim Clark, agrees to an extent. “I regret that it was not reengined, that the weight was not taken out,” he says. However, he also points to the many problems the A350and the 787 have had since the market introductions of the next generation of engines, issues the A380 has not faced to the same degree. He asks whether the A380 may have had the same reliability issues, which are hard enough to handle on a 150-seat narrowbody but could require large sums for passenger compensation and handling for just one canceled A380 flight. The tradeoff between efficiency and reliability was a big consideration.

When Airbus decided to launch the A380, it was still chasing another idea, and therefore the wrong target. “In the 1990s, not only Airbus but also many airlines were still very focused on four engines when it came to widebodies,” Enders recalls. And Airbus thought it had to build an aircraft that would compete with the 747 and break into the Boeing monopoly on very large jets. In 2015, in the midst of increasingly desperate struggles to find new customers, then-CEO Fabrice Bregier conceded that the A380 had been launched “at least 10 years too soon.”

Perhaps it was not launched too soon but too late: In 1990, Boeing received orders for 122 747-400s and delivered 70. Ten years later, when Airbuscommitted to building the A380, 747 orders were down to 26 and deliveries to 25. And with few exceptions since, 747 production has continuously declined.

Airbus’ growing problem was not just the 787, or later its own A350, which further deepened the market shift. In April 2004, it was none other than Air France, in Airbus’ backyard, that took delivery of the first two Boeing 777-300ERs. That aircraft, and not the A380, replaced the 747 as the reference on long-haul trunk routes before slowly being superseded by even more efficient twins.

“We all have misjudged the future of the twins, and that led to the efficiency problem of the A380,” Enders says. “I only admit this reluctantly, but Boeinghas largely been right with its point-to-point argument.” He is referencing the idea that passengers, when having the choice, prefer nonstop flights over hub connections. Both Leahy and Clark disagree with the idea that the hub concept has weakened. “I don’t share the view that the days of the superhub are over at all,” Clark says.

Missed Opportunities

The two-year phase from 2005 to 2007 was crucial to the A380’s early demise, not only because of the growing threat from more efficient twins. In those years, billions of euros in extra costs were added to the program, and important decisions that could have been made were not.

The aircraft had performed its first flight at the end of April 2005, a milestone for the entire aviation industry. Airbus garnered applause from around the world for the achievement. But a little over a month later, the company was forced to announce the first (six-month) delay in the program. As it turned out, different parts of the consortium had used different versions of the CATIA design software and, infamously, as a result many of the cables inside the fuselage were too short.

An almost incomprehensible struggle followed. Airbus threw literally thousands of technicians and engineers at the problem. Many in charge burned out—and many left, but those who stayed learned tough lessons that were incredibly valuable for their later careers. Airbus had to announce two more delays before finally regaining control of the situation toward the end of 2006.

The crisis was so deep that management considered the most radical moves. “We asked ourselves whether we should terminate the program,” Enders reveals. “But that would not have been right back then. Development was very far advanced, and the reputational damage would have been huge.”

There were still consequences. EADS had been formed in 2000 along with the launch of the A380. The former Airbus GIE was converted into a real company a year later. But in 2006, EADS acquired the remaining 20% in Airbus SAS previously held by BAE Systems and proceeded with much deeper integration. “We pushed through relatively brutal integration in 2006-07,” Enders says. “Before that there had been a lot of talk about it but no real action.”

Airlines had their own perspective, which changed substantially between the 2000 launch and entry into service seven years later. “In 2000, you could not predict what crystallized in 2005—that the aircraft was technically outdated,” says Buchholz, who ordered the A380s for Lufthansa. After all, the aircraft’s unit costs were advertised to be 13% better than those of the 747-400. But then things started to move.

Japan opened up Tokyo Haneda Airport for international flights, weakening the argument that the A380 was needed for slot-constrained Narita International Airport. China built new international airports at a record pace and encouraged long-haul service to them. “You could get a feeling that the A380 was going to be too large,” remembers Buchholz. “But you could not really prove it.”

Buchholz contends that it might have been possible to rescue the A380, but it would have required early, decisive and painful action. When the program was delayed bya cabin installation disaster, Airbus should have used the opportunity to modernize the aircraft with a better engine based on ongoing development programs for the 787 and later the A350. “With a better engine, the A380 would have had a longer life,” he says.

“With new engines, it would have been an unbeatable aircraft in the marketplace,” Leahy asserts. “We came close to pulling it off. Had we had the right engines, we would probably have rewritten history.”

But he does not think Buchholz’s idea of pushing for an early reengining then would have been possible. “There were commitments made; the engines were being developed. It would have pushed back the thing a couple of years, [and] there would have been big fights with the engine manufacturers. They had invested a lot of money into that generation of engines.”

On Oct. 15, 2007, Airbus finally delivered the first A380 to Singapore Airlines. A little over a week later, the aircraft flew its first commercial service from Singapore to Sydney. It was a major milestone that, Airbus hoped, would pave the way for a less eventful future and a ramp-up of production to 45 aircraft a year, a rate of just under four aircraft per month. Of course, Airbus never reached rate 45. Production peaked at 30 aircraft in both 2012 and 2014. The last relatively big year for the type was 2016, when Airbus again managed to deliver 28. However, the turning point that likely sealed the aircraft’s fate also occurred in 2016 and led to the end of production five years later.

Weighty Issues

The nine years between 2007 and 2016 continued to be drama-filled. Emirates, by far the type’s most important and loyal operator, had just taken delivery of its first aircraft in early 2008 when the U.S. subprime and global financial crisis unfolded and heavily affected demand for international air travel. Airbus delivered 12 A380s in 2008 and only 10 a year later, a step in the wrong direction. It was not able to expand production in a significant manner until 2010, when it decided to shelve plans for the A380-900 in light of the huge financial burdens accumulated and development work on the A350, A320neoand A400M.

The stretched A380 version was what the Airbus designers really had in mind when they built a wing much larger than necessary for the baseline A380-800. It made that version heavier and so significantly less efficient than would have been possible with a smaller wing optimized for its fuselage size. “The [A380-800] was not the aircraft that we actually wanted to build,” Enders says.

“The design was optimized for larger variants,” Buchholz says. Airlines knew that, of course. But some, like Lufthansa, decided right from the beginning that the -900 would have been too large. The problem with the -800—“you can’t send the upper deck somewhere else when a route does not perform as planned,” as Bucholz puts it—would only have become worse with a larger aircraft, he says. The lack of flexibility was frightening airline planners.

On the other hand, Emirates was foremost of a number of airlines that were very much in favor of the -900. They pointed out that the larger version would be much more efficient and could reinstate the unit-cost advantage over smaller long-haul aircraft, including the A350 and 787. They also saw a market for it on their busiest routes. “We wanted the -900, not the -800,” Clark says. “The aircraft would have had another 120 seats. But when the idea was discussed, there was a slowing down in appetite [at other airlines]. We did not share [their] view.”

The real problem with the A380-900 plan was not that the stretch was never built, it was that it made the -800 a much worse version. “The fact that from the very beginning they built weight into the airplane so they could do the -900 was a program mistake,” Leahy points out. “You just don’t build extra weight into the airplane so you can stretch it. You optimize the aircraft, and then you figure out how to stretch it by taking some of the margin that you did not need. When you build in the capacity for another 100 seats from Day 1, you are going to build a heavy airplane.”

Clark says it still worked well for Emirates. “In the years after the financial crisis, 80% of our profits came from the A380,” he notes. “The A380 is still a hugely efficient aircraft, even though it has old-technology engines.” According to his calculations, a two-class A380 has 4% lower fuel burn per seat than a 787-9 at equivalent space allocation, which would mean putting 670 seats onto the aircraft. Emirates’ two-class A380s currently have 617 seats.

The airline went above and beyond anyone else in the industry to make the aircraft the core of its brand. “It was a wonderful, exciting challenge to deal with this enormous amount of space,” Clark remembers somewhat wistfully. “We put in the bars and the showers. We created a Ritz Carlton.”

But that Ritz Carlton was hugely complex to build. “The showers caused a lot of issues,” Clark says. Pumping hot water up to the upper deck with sufficient pressure was just one of them.

‘A Brick Wall’

One of the biggest misunderstandings in the history of the A380 was its true market potential in China. “If small Dubai can take more than 100 aircraft, we should be able to place a lot more of them into China,” a senior Airbusexecutive recalls thinking. But in the entire production run of the aircraft, only five were actually delivered to a Chinese airline, China Southern, the first of which arrived in October 2011. So why did China not work out?

When Airbus tried to sell the A380 to the nation’s big three—Air China, China Eastern and China Southern—some factors worked against them. Given their relatively poor reputation for customer service and product quality, the carriers lacked confidence that they could compete with their U.S. and European rivals on long-haul routes, let alone with an aircraft that big.

Long-haul flying was also a much smaller part of their business at the time, as opposed to the late 2010s. Being very conservative, the Chinese airlines also disliked launching a new aircraft, or even taking delivery of one, until performance was proven well after market introduction. The odds for Chinese business were always much lower than some in Toulouse had imagined.

“The obvious target [for A380s] should have been Air China,” says one insider. Of the three airlines, it was the one with a base in the country’s capital, and in many ways it was perceived as the flag carrier. But, unfortunately, the airline always had been close to Boeing and ended up being one of the few carriers around the world that ordered the 747-8.

For Leahy, the case is clear. “There was an enormous amount of politics involved in this from the U.S. and Boeing,” he says. “There was a lot of pressure on Beijing to not go with the airplane and stay with the 747. There was a lot of ingrained inertia with the old team in Beijing. That’s where we hit a brick wall.”

Some China experts believe it was still possible at some stage to have placed the A380 with Air China. “If Cathay Pacific had gone for the A380, Air Chinawould have followed,” says a source with knowledge of past talks.“ Cathay certainly would have helped,” Leahy agrees.

Although the carrier’s former CEO Tony Tyler has always been skeptical about the aircraft, Cathay was nonetheless close to an order at various points, particularly in 2010. One time, according to an insider, a deal failed only because Toulouse was not willing to accept some last-minute concessions demanded by the airline.The Hong Kong-based carrier was perceived as a role model for strategy, fleet and product quality by Air China, which has since also become a big shareholder. But Cathay did not jump.

The only order for the A380 ever placed by a Chinese carrier also played a role, notes one executive. “You could argue that selling to China Southern was a mistake,” he says. “It really enraged Air China, because they viewed themselves as the flag carrier. There was also a lot of personal rivalry between the CEOs, and when China Southern went for [the A380], Air China had to show it was the wrong move.”

A fleet of just five aircraft was also suboptimal and a compromise that did not work, particularly from China Southern’s main base in Guangzhou. The airline always planned to base the aircraft at Beijing but was not allowed to deploy them on routes from Air China’s hub. The two carriers tried to negotiate a joint A380 operation but in the end could not come to an agreement.

At one point, Hong Kong Airlines placed an order for 10 A380s, but insiders say the commitment was “never very credible.”

Had Airbus succeeded in breaking into the Chinese market, would it really have been literally with hundreds of aircraft, as some hoped? One executive with deep knowledge of the situation says Air China could have taken no more than 15 A380s and China Eastern and China Southern possibly 10 each. Even if the Hong Kong Airlines deal had gone through, only about 50 aircraft across all Chinese and Hong Kong-based airlines seemed feasible, the executive says. “Two-hundred was never going to be realistic,” he asserts.

In the meantime, the A380 went through its first safety and second industrial crisis. On Nov. 4, 2010, Qantas Flight 32 (QF32), an A380 registered VH-OQA, took off from Singapore Changi Airport bound for Sydney, just like the type’s first commercial flight three years earlier. But this time, the flight did not go smoothly. VH-OQA suffered an uncontained failure of engine No. 2, a Rolls-Royce Trent 900, 4 min. after takeoff, causing extensive damage to the airframe, wings, tanks and one hydraulic system. Two other engines continued to operate, but only in degraded mode.

QF32 landed back in Singapore and no one was hurt, but both Qantas and Singapore Airlines temporarily grounded their A380 fleets. According to a 2011 preliminary report by the Australian Transport Safety Board, 55 Trent 900 engines had to be replaced across the world fleet.

As dramatic as the incident was, the type’s most serious since commercial service had begun also demonstrated the resilency of the aircraft—and the flight’s crew. Redundancy had paid off.

VH-OQA was repaired in Singapore and returned to Australia in April 2012. During the repairs, tiny cracks in the wings were discovered. They turned out to be the start of the next industrial crisis: Airbus had to strengthen certain areas of the wings for in-service aircraft and use a new aluminum alloy for some parts going forward. The problem was eventually fixed, and it is not among the main causes of the premature end of production. But it made the program’s economics even worse. It was becoming increasingly clear that Airbus would never make a profit on the A380.

The Last Stand

But the airframer was still a long way from giving up. About a year after the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) had made mandatory checks for wing cracks, Airbus delivered the 100th A380 to Malaysia Airlines. With the industry now fully out of the global financial crisis, the air transport sector entered an unprecedented period of strong growth, helped by expanding global trade, low interest rates and—for the most part--—relatively low fuel prices. Those in charge in Toulouse were still hopeful the A380 could benefit and somehow turn the corner.

In November 2013, Emirates gave the program another boost: With 39 of the aircraft in service and another 51 on firm order, the airline bought 50 more at the Dubai Airshow. The three big Gulf carriers were peaking—they also placed massive commitments for the new Boeing 777X at the time. The Emirates deal was for the existing aircraft, but the A380neo concept was also discussed. After all, Airbus had launched the A320neo in 2010 and had received much better market feedback than expected.

A year after that Dubai Airshow, Airbus’ then-CEO Fabrice Bregier said the company would “one day” launch an A380neo and a stretch—and the bigger aircraft would get new engines. Six months later, he talked about an A380neo that would enter service around 2020. But in June 2016, Clark announced that the talks about an A380neo had “lapsed.”

“It was becoming apparent that we weren’t getting a customer on board for a Neo or a stretch,” Leahy says. “They were looking at some strong commitments from the engine manufacturers, as well as Airbus, about what the capability was going to be of a reengined airplane.”

Potential customers did not get what they wanted. Only one month later, in July 2016, Airbus made a U-turn by announcing a massive production cut from 28 aircraft that year to just 12 in 2018. The company was trying to buy time, as well as looking for alternatives.

In June 2017, Airbus presented the A380plus concept—the same airframe as before but with a more efficient cabin, around 80 more seats. Space was going to be made available, among other ways, by eliminating the rear staircase that was taking up a lot of room. But, again, customer response was lukewarm. Notably, Emirates did not like the idea since the A380’s luxury—the first-class shower and the bar at the back of the upper deck—had become part of its iconic brand.

Emirates stuck with the aircraft nonetheless. With the A380 deep in crisis mode and questions about its viability (and residual value) swirling, the airline agreed to buy another 36 aircraft at the beginning of 2018. The decision was preceded by months of tense negotiations with both Airbus and Rolls-Royce. The Engine Alliance of General Electric and Pratt & Whitney had long lost interest in further A380 business.

The deal, Airbus hoped, would enable it to sustain production at low but justifiable levels long enough for demand from other airlines to kick in eventually. It was also Leahy’s last marquee deal, a final exclamation point at the end of a very successful decades-spanning career as an aircraft salesman. Almost exactly one year after Leahy returned from the contract talks in Dubai, though, Enders pulled the plug on the project, announcing that production would cease in 2022, a date that would later be pulled forward to November 2021.

When Enders decided to end the program, Leahy had already retired, and the CEO had also announced his own departure. “Tom was leaving the company. He felt the A380 was not selling well, and he wanted to clear the deck for the new team and shut down the program,” the former sales chief says. “That is just the way Tom is.”

Leahy saw things differently. “I fully expected the A380 program to continue with Emirates’ support after I retired,” he says. “I left around February, handed over to a new commercial director and expected to have that deal finalized.”

So why didn’t that happen? “I never really managed to get to the bottom of why they were not able to do it,” he says. “I think it was a combination of Airbus and Rolls-Royce factors. Emirates still wanted to do the deal. I still believe it to this day.”

The case may be more nuanced. Clark remembers that Emirates was going through another round of fleet strategy planning in late 2018 and was coming to the conclusion that a fleet of 120 A380s was going to be “optimal.” At least a large part of that fleet is to be flown “well into the 2030s,” Clark notes.

However, in the end, even Emirates found that it did not want more of the aircraft and instead decided that a supplemental fleet of smaller A350s and 787-9s made more sense."

Airbus has received an order for 255 new aircraft from U.S. private equity firm Indigo Partners in the first significant deal for the company since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.

Indigo, founded and run by investor Bill Franke, owns stakes in airlines including Frontier in the U.S., Hungary's Wizz Air, Mexico's Volaris, and Jetsmart in China and Argentina.

Speaking to CNBC at the Dubai Air Show, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said the deal for the A321 aircraft was a ""very positive signal that we [are starting] to be on the front foot again.""

The value of the deal for the single-aisle passenger jets has not been revealed, but is believed to be worth billions of dollars.

""It's an order that takes us into the second half of the decade — that's very important for Airbus to have visibility on the long term, to plan production as we move from Covid-19 that was [a] constrain on demand, to a world … that is going to constrained by supply,"" Faury told CNBC's Dan Murphy."
First in-flight 100% sustainable-fuels emissions study of passenger jet shows early promise - Airbus,"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0xMS1maXJzdC1pbi1mbGlnaHQtMTAwLXN1c3RhaW5hYmxlLWZ1ZWxzLWVtaXNzaW9ucy1zdHVkeS1vZi1wYXNzZW5nZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 29 November 2021 – Initial findings from a world-first study of the impact of 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on both engines of a commercial jet have provided promising early results.

The ECLIF3 study, involving Airbus, Rolls-Royce, German research centre DLR and SAF producer Neste, marks the first time 100% SAF has been measured simultaneously on both engines of a commercial passenger aircraft – an Airbus A350 aircraft powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines.

In-flight emissions tests and associated ground testing on the ECLIF3 programme began earlier this year and have recently resumed. The interdisciplinary team, which also includes researchers from the National Research Council of Canada and The University of Manchester, plans to publish its results in academic journals towards the end of next year and 2023.

Findings from the study will support efforts currently underway at Airbus and Rolls-Royce to ensure the aviation sector is ready for the large-scale use of SAF as part of the wider initiative to decarbonise the industry. Aircraft are currently only allowed to operate on a 50% blend of SAF and conventional jet fuel, but both companies support the drive to certify 100% SAF use.

In April, the A350 flew three flights over the Mediterranean Sea pursued by a DLR Falcon chaser plane to compare in-flight emissions of both kerosene and Neste’s hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) sustainable fuel. The team also carried out compliance tests using 100% SAF and no operational issues were experienced.

In-flight emission tests using 100% SAF and a HEFA/Jet A-1 fuel blend resumed this month, while ground-based emissions testing to quantify the benefits of SAF on local air quality were also performed. The research team found SAF releases fewer particulates than conventional kerosene at all tested engine operating conditions, which points to the potential for reduced climate impact and improvement in air quality around airports.

In addition, SAF has lower density but higher energy content per kilogram of fuel compared to conventional kerosene, which brings some aircraft fuel-efficiency advantages due to lower fuel burn and less fuel mass to board to achieve the same mission. Detailed analysis by the team is on-going.

“Engines and fuel systems can be tested on the ground but the only way to gather the full set of emissions data necessary for this programme to be successful is to fly an aircraft in real conditions,” said Steven Le Moing, New Energy Programme Manager at Airbus. “In-flight testing of the A350 offers the advantage of characterising direct and indirect engine emissions, including particulates from behind an aircraft at high altitude.”

Simon Burr, Rolls-Royce Director of Product Development and Technology, Civil Aerospace, said: “This research adds to tests we’ve already carried out on our engines, both on the ground and in the air, which have found no engineering obstacle to our engines running on 100% SAF. If we are to truly decarbonise long-haul air travel, then 100% SAF is a critical element and we are committed to supporting its certification for service.”

The DLR Falcon chaser aircraft is equipped with multiple probes to measure emissions at cruise level down to a distance of only 100 metres from the A350 and feed them into scientific instrumentation for analysis.

“SAF has been shown to have a significantly lower carbon footprint over its life cycle compared to conventional jet fuel and now we are seeing it is advantageous in reducing non-CO2 effects too,” said Markus Fischer, DLR’s Divisional Board Member for Aeronautics. “Tests such as these are continuing to develop our understanding of 100% SAF, its use in flight and we are seeing positive signs for its potential in climate mitigation. We look forward to studying the data from the second series of ECLIF3 flights, which restarted with a first chase flight above the Mediterranean earlier this month.""

In 2015, DLR performed the ECLIF1 campaign, investigating alternative fuels with its Falcon and A320 ATRA research aircraft. These investigations continued in 2018 with the ECLIF2 campaign which saw the A320 ATRA flying with a mixture of standard jet fuel and up to 50% HEFA. This research showed the advantageous emission performance of fuel mixtures up to 50% SAF and paved the way for the 100% SAF test flights for ECLIF3.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Airbus kicked off the 2021 Dubai Air Show with a bang, landing massive deals from day one. The French aerospace manufacturer had amassed 408 announced orders and commitments by the end of the show's fourth day, Wednesday, while its American counterpart Boeing trailed with 101. Airbus and Boeing are the world's two largest aerospace companies by revenue. The order numbers so far from the first major air show since the Covid-19 pandemic began are a positive sign for aviation and travel, which suffered devastating losses for much of the last 18 months. ""We view orders for new aircraft as positive for the recovery of the commercial aerospace industry,"" Morgan Stanley said in a research note Wednesday. Airbus scored its first big win on day one of the air show, with an order for 255 of its narrow-body A321neo and A321XLR jets from American private equity firm Indigo Partners, which buys planes for low-cost carriers like Frontier, Wizz Air, Jetsmart and Volaris. It then notched a letter of intent from Air Lease Corp, set to be finalized in the coming months, for 111 aircraft across the Airbus product range: 55 A321neos, 25 A220-300s, 20 A321XLRs, seven A350F freighters and four A330neos.

The deal from Indigo Partners, the first major aircraft order since the pandemic began, was a ""very positive signal that we [are starting] to be on the front foot again,"" Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury told CNBC during the show. Kuwaiti airline Jazeera Airways committed to 28 Airbus A321neos, and Nigeria's Ibom Air committed to its first Airbus purchase with an order for 10 A220s. The popularity of narrow-body jets at this year's air show came as a surprise to some analysts, who say the Middle East event is more known for orders of wide-body planes used for longer-haul flights. On the military side, Airbus also sold two A330 Multi Role Tanker Transports, an aerial refueling tanker aircraft, to the UAE Air Force and Air Defense, and clinched a new export order for two A400M airlifters from the Indonesian Ministry of Defense. Boeing saw some relief on Tuesday with a large order of 72 of its 737 Max from new Indian airline Akasa Air. It also had success with freighters, with orders for 11 of its 737-800BCF cargo planes from aircraft leasing company Icelease, nine converted 767-300BCF freighters from DHL, and orders for two of its long-range 777F freighters from Emirates SkyCargo. The American aerospace giant also received four orders of passenger planes and freighters from Air Tanzania and three of its widebody 777-300 passenger jets from UAE-based aviation services provider Sky One FZE.

Cargo planes and converted freighters are a hot sub-sector of the aviation industry as e-commerce booms and air shipment grows. Cargo is the only air traffic segment that has gone above 2019 levels. For Dubai's flagship carried Emirates Airline alone, cargo operations in its latest half-year earnings were robust, seeing a 39% increase and bringing the business to 90% of the volume it had pre-pandemic. ""The freighter markets are on fire right now. That's where we see real growth,"" Stan Deal, executive vice president of Boeing, told CNBC in Dubai on Sunday. The company plans to add three conversion lines — facilities that convert aircraft to freighters — for its 737-800BCF across North America and Europe. Boeing has long dominated the air cargo market, but its French rival Airbus could threaten that with its A350F, a cargo version of its widebody passenger A350-1000, ordered for the first time in Dubai this week.

The aircraft operated with a blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). SAF provides a reduction of up to 80% in carbon emissions over its lifecycle, compared to traditional jet fuel.

The aircraft is powered by Pratt & Whitney PW1100G engines and seats 180 passengers in a two-class layout. The A321neo incorporates the Airbus Cabin Flex, which enables optimal use of space by relocating various fixtures and fittings, providing the highest levels of passenger comfort.

CAL’s A321neo will be able to fly on routes of up to seven hours from Taipei.

CAL’s A321neos also come with a Cargo Loading System that enables container cargo operations, further reinforcing the airline and Taipei’s position as a global air freight hub.

Altogether CAL will acquire 25 A321neo aircraft, comprising 11 directly ordered from Airbus and 14 under lease agreements. The A321neo will form the core of CAL’s single-aisle fleet and offers cockpit commonality with CAL’s existing A330 and A350 aircraft.

Pilot report: an Airbus H145 pilot evaluates the 5-blade upgrade - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 08 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvcGlsb3QtcmVwb3J0LWFpcmJ1cy1oMTQ1LWZpdmUtYmxhZGUtdXBncmFkZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"While there are plenty of great reasons to have an intuitive and expeditious quick-start procedure, getting the air conditioning up and running on a mid-August day in Mississippi is as good as any I’ve heard. Fortunately our helicopter of choice for the day was an Airbus H145 D3, the first example of the five-bladed helicopter in North America and configured as a demonstrator for the UH-72B Lakota. With one of the quickest starts of any twin on the market, we were ready to go skids up in remarkably short order.

Departing from the ramp at the Airbus Helicopters final assembly line in Columbus, Mississippi, the primary purpose of our flight was to evaluate the UH-72B Lakota’s suitability and performance as the National Guard’s newest utility helicopter — stay tuned for that report in an upcoming issue of Vertical Valor. However, given the nature of the Lakota program as a commercial-off-the-shelf helicopter, the aircraft we flew also doubled as a demonstrator for the commercial market. As a part-time Guardsman whose civilian employment coincidentally involves flying both the H145 (BK117 D2) and EC145 (BK117 C2), I was equally as intrigued to see how the new five-bladed H145 D3 would perform for traditional civil aviation roles.

It would be impossible to properly discuss the H145 D3 without first addressing the initial jump from the EC145 to the H145 D2. To the casual observer it’s easy to dismiss the upgrades as a mild improvement or simply a name change for the sake of branding from “EC” to “H,” with the addition of a Fenestron tail rotor often being viewed as the only noteworthy difference. This perception has contributed to the popularity of the EC145e in the North American market for budget-conscious operators who view the H145 D2 as an unnecessary upgrade.

While budgetary constraints are an unavoidable reality for many operators, the view of the H145 D2 as simply a minor upgrade doesn’t comport with the reality of operating the aircraft. As a pilot who flies both types on a daily basis, it’s hard to overstate how drastically the workload and stress are reduced when flying the H145 D2 vs. the EC145 — from the full authority digital engine control (FADEC) quick start procedure, to the twin Garmin GTN 750 touchscreen flight navigators, synthetic vision, better visibility, Helionix multi-function displays, and four-axis autopilot, not to mention the vastly increased performance and range.

The improvement is drastic for even visual flight rules (VFR) operations, but it’s beyond compare when it comes to single-pilot instrument flight rules (SPIFR), making those operations not only safer, but exponentially more feasible for pilots with minimal actual instrument time making the transition to an IFR operator. After becoming accustomed to the ease of SPIFR operations in the H145 D2, it feels almost risky to step back into legacy airframes.

While the large list of changes revolutionized the aircraft, some of them led to what many operators perceive as a significant increase in felt vibrations, notably in the cabin. For the civil market — particularly helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) and VIP operations, where ride quality is of the utmost importance — this was especially detrimental.

By developing the five-bladed H145 (BK117 D3), Airbus set out to radically improve the ride quality and performance of the legacy BK117 rotor system. The new system is based off that of the H135, scaled up, with an additional blade. The blades are mounted directly to the mast, making the system simpler, lighter, and easier to maintain than the original rotor system.

There have been several pieces written detailing the process and engineering behind this, but put simply from a pilot’s perspective, the changes most decidedly worked. The H145 D3 is in fact a helicopter, which is to say some vibrations are still apparent, particularly when passing through effective translational lift (ETL), but they are drastically reduced and mostly noticeable only when actively focusing on them. For those accustomed to flying in the H145 D2, it’s a surreal experience on initial pickup and it feels glassy smooth through all regimes of flight. If it’s not outright the smoothest helicopter I’ve flown, it’s certainly close. Additionally and arguably even more importantly, the ride quality in the cabin is a marked improvement over the H145 D2, even more so than in the cockpit area.

With less componentry associated with the rotor system and the elimination of the anti-vibration system, the helicopter has also gained an additional 330 pounds (150 kilograms) of useful load. You won’t often hear this from a helicopter pilot, but I’ve always felt the H145 D2 has more than enough power, particularly when compared to the EC145 and its other competitors. Admittedly, this is in part due to my operating near to sea level, but even at low density altitudes, many helicopters lack sufficient power to operate anywhere near the advertised max gross weight with out of ground effect (OGE) power.

The D2 regularly has no issue being flown right up to max gross weight without running into power limitations for vertical takeoffs or Cat A profiles. Even more impressively, it maintains single-engine out of ground effect hover capabilities throughout a substantial portion of the flight, leaving a tremendous margin in terms of safety. With the improved performance of the five-bladed H145 D3, any concerns about power go from being rare, to almost a non-factor for all but high-altitude mountain operations. Even there, the H145 D3 is capable of operating in many areas that were previously only accessible in high-performance single-engine helicopters.

During our flight, Airbus instructor pilot Aaron Hupp demonstrated several engine failures in varying regimes of flight, using the training button which presents a remarkably accurate simulation of a single-engine failure. At all but the highest of gross weights while in an OGE hover, this is very much a non-event, and even then, it’s much less of an emotional moment than in many other twins. As someone who regularly conducts rooftop helipad operations in heavily congested metropolitan areas with limited escapes, this type of performance is comforting, to say the least.

While these changes have built off and improved an already impressive base, they unfortunately haven’t impacted the cruise speed. Much like the D2, it still maintains right around 120 knots in level flight, leaving this as the sole noteworthy area left for improvement on the type when it comes to performance.

From the author’s perspective, the upgrades made to the H145 D3 “most decidedly worked.” Michael Tosi Photo

Outside of the rotor system, the H145 D2 to D3 is very much an evolutionary upgrade, but it’s still clear Airbus has listened intently to operators during the development process. The list of issues or changes I would have made to the H145 D2 was fairly short to start with and remarkably, Airbus has managed to address quite literally all of them. These included improvements to the air conditioning system (very noticeable on an August day in Mississippi), upping mast moment limits, some minor autopilot adjustments, automatic flight control system tweaks to address yaw oscillations while on steep approaches descending through ETL, and the addition of an auxiliary hydraulic pump for the flight control check.

The H145 D2 is an excellent helicopter and truly revolutionary when compared to its predecessor, but the persistent issues with vibrations have kept it from being truly great, particularly for its primary markets where ride quality is paramount. This combined with budgetary concerns has led to slower adoption of the H145 D2 in the North American market than in Europe.

While the five-bladed H145 D3 is a progressive improvement to the type, when combined with the drastic advances made with the D2, it brings together the whole package and puts the aircraft into a class of its own. As performance, safety, and capabilities of the type continue to improve at such a drastic clip, it will become increasingly difficult for operators to stick with legacy models."
Indonesia Ministry of Defence orders two Airbus A400Ms - Airbus,"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0xMS1pbmRvbmVzaWEtbWluaXN0cnktb2YtZGVmZW5jZS1vcmRlcnMtdHdvLWFpcmJ1cy1hNDAwbXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aircraft to be delivered in multirole tanker and transport configuration

Letter of Intent for four additional aircraft

Dubai, 18 November 2021 – The Indonesia Ministry of Defence has placed an order for two Airbus A400M aircraft in multirole tanker and transport configuration.

The contract, which will become effective in 2022, will bring the total number of A400M operators to ten nations. The agreement includes a complete maintenance and training support package. A Letter of Intent was also signed for the future acquisition of four additional A400M aircraft.

”This new order will further expand the A400M footprint in the Asia-Pacific region. The A400M offers outstanding capabilities to Indonesia, providing its air force with the perfect platform to deliver large and heavy loads into remote areas and multiplying its airpower projection thanks to reliable aerial refuelling capabilities,” said Michael Schoellhorn, CEO of Airbus Defence and Space.

Capable of operating from rough and short runways, the A400M will strengthen the Indonesian Air Force’s airlift capabilities to rapidly respond to any crisis, demonstrated in the aftermath of the earthquake and subsequent tsunami that struck the country in 2018. The A400M was the first large airlifter able to deliver heavy loads like fuel trucks and excavators as well as food, clothes and medical supplies using a damaged and short runway in Palu (Central Sulawesi, Indonesia).

“The A400M is a truly multi-role platform and will greatly enhance the Indonesian Air Force’s tactical air-to-air capabilities. This aircraft will play a key role in other key missions including paratrooping and heavy cargo transportation. We are also looking at additional A400M acquisition in the near term, with future A400M developments such as firefighting an important capability we are exploring jointly with Airbus. The A400M will become a national asset and the cornerstone for Human Assistance and Disaster Response missions, beyond its tactical and air-to-air capabilities,” said Prabowo Subianto, Minister of Defence of the Republic of Indonesia.

The A400M can carry heavy and outsize loads across strategic distances, deliver these into tactical locations, while offering the added aerial refuelling capability. An ideal solution to meet air forces’ multirole tanker and transport aircraft requirements.

With the ability to fly fast and at high and extremely low altitudes, the A400M is the ideal platform for refuelling fighter and other major aircraft by means of two underwing refuelling pods. Its built-in air-to-air refuelling capability allows rapid reconfiguration as a tanker, making it easily adaptable to changing operational scenarios and missions. This adaptability is unique to the A400M, which can itself also be refuelled in flight.

Release Date November 14, 2021 Airbus tees up early A350 freighter orders with Air Lease Purchase a PDF of this article

Dubai — Airbus is nearing the announcement of its first A350 freighter orders, anchored by lessor Air Lease Corp. and one other yet-to-be determined cargo carrier, according to people familiar with the company’s planning. The leasing giant is said to be in advanced discussions with the European plane maker to provide the company its first orders for the new freighter.

Air Lease has been at the forefront of Airbus’s two most recent new single-aisle aircraft development programs, including its A321XLR in 2019 and its A321LR in 2015.

Both Boeing and Airbus are riding a wave of demand for dedicated and converted freighter aircraft as the pandemic has sidelined the ample bellies of large twin-aisle passengers used for carrying cargo and a long-term boom in global e-commerce.

Airbus is said to also be in talks with UPS, FedEx Express, and the cargo units of Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific and Lufthansa, the latter three being existing A350 passenger operators. The plane maker formally launched the freighter variant of its latest twin-aisle aircraft earlier this year.

Further, Etihad, based in nearby Abu Dhabi, is currently working with Airbus to renegotiate its order of single-aisle A320neo family aircraft, potentially swapping the 26 aircraft for an undetermined number of A350 freighters, the person said. Other possible candidates for launch could be the new merged Korean Air and Asiana Airlines. The latter has 21 existing A350-900 and -1000 passenger aircraft on order and those could be converted to freighters."
Airbus details A350F specifications - Leeham News and Analysis,"Thu, 11 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8xMS9haXJidXMtZGV0YWlscy1hMzUwZi1zcGVjaWZpY2F0aW9ucy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Scott Hamilton and Bjorn Fehrm

November 11, 2021, © Leeham News: Airbus has given more information about what led to their new freighter, the A350F, and its data. Scott Hamilton talked to Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer at the IATA AGM on Oct. 3-5 in Boston, and Bjorn Fehrm spoke to Head of Freighter marketing, Crawford Hamilton, about the technical details. (The two Hamiltons are not related.)

The A350F is the most capable new-build freighter Airbus has designed, posing the most serious threat to Boeing’s dominance of jet freighters since the dawn of the jet age. Some expect Boeing to respond next week with a program launch of the 777XF, but LNA understands this won’t be the case.

“The market has asked us to produce it,” said Scherer of the A350F. “So we launched the program based on our own belief of the strength of the business case.”

“The A350F beats the competing production freighter (Boeing’s 777F, our note) on payload, volume, and economics,” says Crawford Hamilton. “We have taken extra care to make the door larger and the floor extra sturdy to ease loading planning and execution. The A350F will be the freight forwarder’s preferred machine.”

The background to the A350F

Airbus launched the A350F without firm launch customers, an unusual move. “We have launched this program on the basis of our own belief of the strength of the business case,” Scherer said in an interview with LNA during the IATA AGM Oct. 3-5 in Boston. “The market has asked us to produce it. The market dynamic that has given birth to this program is one, the very fact, and I think that’s the most important one, that it is some of our customers who came to us and said, this looks like a really good idea. This wasn’t a bunch of guys somewhere in an office in Toulouse saying, ‘Oh, let’s do a freighter.’ This was a market-generated demand stimulated by the fact that I think the market felt it needed competition.”

“The other thing is the ICAO edict that Boeing 777s and 767s will not meet emissions standards,” Scherer said. The 777-200LRF and 767, with designs dating to the 1990s and 1980s, can’t be produced after 2027 under ICAO standards. The A350F and the prospective 777XF will.

Getting it right this time

Scherer said that the A350 with its structure, in particular the A350-1000 version, “which is the world’s longest-range airplane, has a structural capability that previous Airbus airplanes did not have to receive the density of heavy cargo and not just packaged freight.”

Airbus’ previous freighters fell short on structure. “The A300 is a very good package freighter. It’s not a heavy-duty freighter,” Scherer said. “The mistake Airbus made [with the A330-200F] was to say, ‘Look, we don’t have an airplane that is really capable of that having density, but we want that range.’ We developed the 330 freighter on the basis of the -200, and that was the mistake. We should have done it on the -300, because the 200, even though it’s got a little better structural capability than the -300 still doesn’t have the structural capability for the heavy freight. We should’ve gone for volumetric payload, as opposed to trying to compromise between structural payload and volume. We’re not making that same mistake [with the A350] because we’re starting with the bigger module.”

Yet, making the A350 a freighter was nevertheless an afterthought when designing the airplane.

The 787 doesn’t lend itself well to a freighter. Boeing has a challenge with doing a cargo door in a barrel composite airplane. Airbus chose the panel approach for the A350. Was Airbus thinking about a cargo version of the airplane, or did it just happen to work out that way?

“It’s tempting to say it was all part of a grand plan,” Scherer said candidly.

The A350F, larger and more capable

The A350F is based on the A350-1000 in its highest Maximum TakeOff Weight (MTOW) variant, the 319t model. The A350-1000 is shortened with five frames ahead of the wing, so the center of gravity is kept in an optimal place for the freighter (Figure 2).

The A350F is still 6.9m longer than the Boeing 777F, which is based on the shorter 777-200LR. This gives the A350F a 10% larger freighter volume at 695m3 compared with 633m3 for the 777F. The A350F volume is the same as the main deck volume of the Boeing 747-8F.

The A350F also takes a higher payload at 109t versus 103.7t, a 4.5% increase over the 777F. The design freight density is 157kg/m3 (9.8lb/ft3) versus 164kg/m3 (10.2lb/ft3) for the 777F.

The A350-1000 is reinforced to take this higher payload (the max payload for a standard A350-1000 is 63t). The reinforcements are in the main deck aluminum floor beams which are made extra strong so that the loadmaster doesn’t have to place heavy pallets at specific positions in the aircraft.

The extra-large maindeck cargo door is placed behind the wing so that the loading of cargo can’t make the aircraft sit on its tail (pallets are moved to the front before the rear is filled up).

A big portion of the 46t increase in payload over the A350-1000 comes from a lighter aircraft. When the passenger cabin is removed, and the aircraft is shortened, a whopping 30t is removed from the empty weight of the A350-1000. This makes the A350F 20t lighter than the 777F.

Airbus claims this difference in empty weight and the more modern engines (Rolls-Royce Trent XWB 97k) give the A350F a clear advantage in operating cost. We will do our checks of the economics of the competitors using our airliner performance model in a coming article.

2025 EIS—and Boeing’s response

Airbus targets late 2025 for entry-into-service. If it meets this target, or even if it slips into 2026, EIS could be years ahead of the still-to-be-launched Boeing next generation freighter, the 777XF.

The 777XF, based on the 777X, was based on the ultra-long-range 777-8. But following the 737 MAX grounding and COVID crisis, Boeing put the development of the -8 on hold, and by it, the 777XF. The original business plan for the 777X program called for EIS of the 777-9, followed by two years of the 777-8 passenger model and two years later by the 777XF, which was to be based largely on the -8. The original timeline was the first quarter of 2020 (with some hope for 4Q2019), 2022, and 2024, respectively.

EIS for the 777-9 has slipped nearly four years. The target is now late 2023. Technical issues with the giant GE9X engines caused an initial delay of about nine months. Then, the MAX grounding and certification issues caused a knock-on effect to the 777X certification. The COVID pandemic wiped out international passenger demand for which the 777X was designed. The best estimates for demand recovery are 2023, though most see full recovery not occurring until 2024 or even 2025.

The strong freighter market and the upcoming ICAO recommendations about engine emissions have moved the plans for a 777X freighter ahead of the 777-8. Boeing recognizes that with the ICAO standards looming, it must go forward with a new freighter. CEO David Calhoun, on the Oct. 26 3Q earnings call and in previous events, said Boeing is likely to launch the XF program.

He gave no timeline, but Bloomberg News suggests a program launch could come at the Dubai Air Show Nov. 14-18. This timeline seems aggressive. Market intelligence suggests Boeing won’t have an XF EIS ready until 2029, more than a year after the production of the 777LRF and 767F must end—and up to four years after the targeted EIS for the A350F. LNA is told the 777XF program launch is unlikely before 2022.

408 aircraft including the first A350F ordered at the Dubai airshow - Airbus,"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0xMS00MDgtYWlyY3JhZnQtaW5jbHVkaW5nLXRoZS1maXJzdC1hMzUwZi1vcmRlcmVkLWF0LXRoZS1kdWJhaS1haXJzaG930gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Dubai, 18 November 2021 – In the first major airshow since the COVID-19 pandemic struck two years ago, customers demonstrated confidence in the recovery of the aviation sector and also in Airbus by placing orders and commitments totalling 408 aircraft (269 firm orders and 139 commitments). The agreements covered the full range of commercial aircraft families, including a first commitment for the A350F freighter derivative.

At a pre-show event, Airbus launched its latest global market forecast outlining progressively shifting demand from fleet growth to accelerated retirement of older, less fuel-efficient aircraft resulting in a need for some 39,000 new-build passenger and freighter aircraft. Of these,15,250 aircraft (around 40%) are for replacements.

With the UAE Universal expo showcasing themes on Mobility, Sustainability and Opportunity, on the eve of the airshow Airbus lit up the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, by displaying its Company purpose - “Pioneering sustainable aerospace for a safe and united world” - on the façade of this iconic Dubai landmark at a time when connecting with people and cultures has never been more important.

On the opening day of the show, Indigo Partners portfolio airlines placed a firm order for 255 A321neo Family aircraft, including 29 XLR. The order breakdown is as follows: Wizz Air 102 aircraft (75 A321neo + 27 A321XLR); Frontier 91 aircraft (A321neo); Volaris 39 aircraft (A321neo); JetSMART 23 aircraft (21 A321neo + 2 A321XLR).

The second day saw Air Lease Corporation sign a commitment for 111 aircraft covering the full range of aircraft families including the new A350 Freighter (25 A220-300s, 55 A321neos, 20 A321XLRs, four A330neos, seven A350Fs). Along with the orders, ALC and Airbus announced the first ever joint ESG scheme in aircraft procurement - a joint Sustainability Fund - to foster industry decarbonisation solutions.

On the third day, Jazeera Airways committed to 28 A321neos and Nigeria’s Ibom Air became a new Airbus customer with a firm order for 10 A220s.

On the defence side, Airbus sold two additional Airbus A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) to the United Arab Emirates Air Force and Air Defence, and secured a new export order for two A400M new generation airlifters from the Indonesian Ministry of Defence.

At the show, Airbus also highlighted its ambition to play a leading role in developing innovative and sustainable solutions for urban air mobility, leveraging partnerships and technologies to bring a product to the market by 2025.

Jean Pierson attended the military academy of La Flèche. In 1963 after graduating from the ENSA (l’Ecole Nationale Supérieure de l'Aéronautique, the French national institute for aeronautical engineering) he joined Sud-Aviation as a production engineer. In 1972 he became General Manager of SOCATA (Aerospatiale’s light aircraft subsidiary), General Manager of Aerospatiale’s Toulouse factory in 1976 and from1983 until 1985, Manager of the Aerospatiale Commercial Aircraft division.

In 1985 he was appointed Managing Director of the Airbus Industrie consortium, a position he held until 1998. Pierson oversaw the launch of the A330 and A340 programmes as well as the expansion of the A320 family with the A318, A319 and A321, and was the main decision-maker behind the launch of the UHCA (Ultra High Capacity Aircraft) programme which gave birth to the A380.

Jean Pierson played a large part in the success of Airbus which, under his tenure, underwent a period of intense growth and rose to the rank of the world's leading aircraft manufacturer. This significantly increased the company's market share and laid the foundations for the company’s integration.

Jean Pierson was a Chevalier of the Légion d’honneur and Officer of the French National Order of Merit, was a recipient of the German Bundesverdienstkreuz, Honorary Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire and Grand Officer of the Spanish Order of Civil Merit, In 1999, the Association of Professional Aeronautics and Space Journalists (AJPAE) awarded him the Icare award.

It is with great sadness that we learn of the passing of Jean Pierson. Today's Airbus, an international company with roots in several European countries, owes so much to this entrepreneur for whom cooperation was the key to success. He enabled Airbus Industrie to leverage its different national strengths and with his foresight and the different innovation capabilities, set our company on the path to success. I would like to pay tribute to him personally and on behalf of all Airbus employees

Airbus Designs Vegan Leather Helicopter Interior - vegconomist - the vegan business magazine,"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdmVnY29ub21pc3QuY29tL2Zhc2hpb24tZGVzaWduLWFuZC1iZWF1dHkvYWlyYnVzLWRlc2lnbnMtdmVnYW4tbGVhdGhlci1oZWxpY29wdGVyLWludGVyaW9yL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aerospace corporation Airbus has kitted out one of its Corporate Helicopters with a fully vegan interior. The special design was made at the request of a customer, German construction entrepreneur Dr. Urs Brunner.

Brunner is married to fashion designer Daniela Brunner, founder of ethical fashion house Giulia & Romeo. The brand uses no animal products, and Ms. Brunner was determined that the helicopter’s interior would be in line with these ethics.

Instead of conventional leather, Airbus used a vegan alternative called Ultraleather — which looks like animal leather and has the same durability — in the Brunners’ helicopter. The passenger seats, central storage cabinet, rear partition, and cockpit control cuffs were all redesigned to use the material.

Vegan leather interiors

Vegan leather is rapidly gaining in popularity in car interiors, with Volvo recently revealing plans to make all new cars leather-free. Meanwhile, BMW will be partnering with Desserto to use cactus leather, after announcing plans to end the use of conventional leather in all Mini and 5-Series cars. Mercedes has also been experimenting with animal-free interiors, after vegan Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton attempted to convince the company to stop using leather.

The vegan automotive leather market is forecast to grow with a CAGR of 48% over the period 2020-2026. In the wake of this progress, it seems inevitable that vegan leather will soon be widely used in the interiors of other vehicles such as aircraft.

“We’re very proud of our team’s work in creating this bespoke ACH Line interior. The material that we used is certified for aviation use and is hard-wearing, but it can only be stretched in one direction which means it is a challenge to work with, particularly on the seats,” said Head of ACH Frederic Lemos. “This is where the craftsmanship of our hands-on team became crucial and I am delighted to say that we found a practical way to meet our customer’s desires which also looks superb.”"
Tale of two companies: Airbus recovers as Boeing reels - Tech Xplore,"Sat, 13 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHhwbG9yZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTExLXRhbGUtY29tcGFuaWVzLWFpcmJ1cy1yZWNvdmVycy1ib2VpbmcuaHRtbNIBTWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHhwbG9yZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTExLXRhbGUtY29tcGFuaWVzLWFpcmJ1cy1yZWNvdmVycy1ib2VpbmcuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"While Airbus has returned to profit in the first 10 months of the year, Boeing remains in the red.

The aviation industry is slowly recovering from last year's Covid-induced downturn, but European aircraft maker Airbus is having a smoother ride than American rival Boeing, which has endured a series of crises.

The world's dominant aerospace companies will seek new business as they attend the five-day Dubai air show on Sunday, the industry's first major event since the pandemic started last year.

But while Airbus has returned to profit and delivered 460 aircraft in the first 10 months of the year, Boeing remains in the red and has supplied just 268 planes.

Boeing's 737 MAX returned to the skies last year after the entire fleet was grounded for 20 months following two crashes—in Ethiopia and Indonesia—that left 346 people dead.

Almost 370 of the planes remain in inventory and Boeing chief executive David Calhoun has said that it will take two years to sell them all.

The 737 MAX has also yet to be re-certified in China, a major market for aircraft makers. Boeing's production plans will depend on access to the Chinese market, Calhoun says.

The 787 Dreamliner has had its share of problems which is estimated to have cost the company $1 billion.

The company halted deliveries of the 787 in May following a series of issues with the plane—the second suspension in the past year.

Boeing announced in July that it had spotted additional problems near the nose of the plane and was working to fix them.

A delay for the first deliveries of its new wide-body 777X plane—which were pushed back from 2022 to late 2023—is costing the company $6.5 billion.

""There's been so many problems that it's very difficult to say they're over,"" Richard Aboulafia, analyst at aerospace consultancy Teal Group, told AFP.

Covid cuts long-haul flights

Covid has also hit Boeing's strong point—long-haul aircraft—as international travel has been curbed by pandemic restrictions, said Remy Bonnery, an analyst at Archery Strategy Consulting.

International air traffic is only expected to return to pre-pandemic levels between 2023 and 2025.

Domestic air travel, meanwhile, is doing better—which benefits Airbus and its A320 family of narrow-body aircraft.

Airbus will display its latest single-aisle plane, the A321neo, in Dubai.

The company aims to release the long-range version of the aircraft in 2023, the A321XLR, which can fly for 10 hours—a feat only achieved by bigger planes until now.

""Airbus is alone in the single-aisle, long-haul market,"" said Bonnery at Archery Strategy Consulting.

""The next 10 years, we will have more plane deliveries by Airbus than Boeing,"" he said.

'Staunch the bleeding'

Boeing decided last year to hold off on launching its New Midsize Aircraft (NMA) project. The plan was to deliver by 2025 an aircraft that could transport up to 275 passengers nearly 9,000 kilometres (5,600 miles).

The US company ""is losing 10 points of market share, largely due to the A321neo. Losing 10 points of market share is a road towards being a marginal player,"" Aboulafia said.

Boeing would have to launch a new plane to claw back market share, said Michel Merluzeau, an analyst at AIR consultancy.

""It must really staunch the bleeding against Airbus,"" Merluzeau said.

Regaining a place on the market ""is very complicated and very expensive""—at least $15 billion—he said.

Boeing's debt has increased five-fold in less than three years to $62 billion.

It would be hard for Boeing to get a new plane out before 2028-2029, according to Merluzeau.

Calhoun indicated in October that the company has put a team together to design a new plane and production system.

Airbus unveils jet trainer with eyes on Spain - Defense News,"Mon, 08 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9kaWdpdGFsLXNob3ctZGFpbGllcy9mZWluZGVmLzIwMjEvMTEvMDgvYWlyYnVzLXVudmVpbHMtamV0LXRyYWluZXItd2l0aC1leWVzLW9uLXNwYWluL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MADRID — By the end of this decade, the Spanish Air Force will replace its half-century-old fighter trainers with data-centric aircraft to train its pilots to fly fifth- and sixth-generation jets. And even though a contract isn’t yet on the horizon, Airbus is ready to start building.

The aerospace company’s Spanish subsidiary presented its Advanced Fighter Jet Trainer concept last week during the biennial FEINDEF conference in Madrid, Spain. If selected, the AFJT would replace the Spanish Air Force’s Northrop F-5M and CASA C-101 Aviojet aircraft, which prepare airmen to fly EF-18A Hornets and Eurofighter Typhoons.

The AFJT is a clean-sheet design based on the Spanish Air Force’s operational requirements, Abel Nin, the company’s program lead, told Defense News on the sidelines of FEINDEF on Friday.

Currently, the aircraft is designed to measure about 46 feet from nose to tail, with a nearly 33-foot wingspan. The metal airframe will be damage-tolerant, resistant to corrosion and easy to repair, per Airbus.

Nin expects a prototype could fly four years after the program is formally launched. While the Air Force plans to buy at least 20 Eurofighter Typhoons to replace its oldest EF-18As, it may opt to buy more Typhoons or Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter to replace its full Hornet fleet.

The AFJT will be capable of training pilots to fly EF-18As, Typhoons, F-35s and the Future Combat Air System’s sixth-generation fighter jet, Nin said.

The proposed integrated trainer system will feature live-virtual-constructive technology, and Indra is partnering with Airbus to develop simulators, Nin said.

While Madrid is Airbus’ main prospective customer, the AFJT could serve other countries. Representatives from the Mexican Air Force attended Friday’s panel discussion at FEINDEF, and company officials previously highlighted France and Finland as possible customers.

“The main purpose here is to initiate the project,” Nin said.

The Spanish Air Force submitted the operational requirements document for a new jet trainer in 2020, said Lt. Col. Jesus Gutierrez Gallego, who works with the service’s program planning division. The service doesn’t recommend a specific vendor, and now it’s up to the Defence Ministry to deliberate and decide whether Airbus will receive the contract, he told Defense News.

“We need it before the current system starts its sundown,” he said.

Air Force officials said the F-5M is expected to begin retiring from service between 2027 and 2030.

Ministry officials at the conference could not say when a decision on the trainer jet contract might be made, nor did they say whether any other companies submitted proposals for the F-5M replacement.

The F-5M has been in service for more than 50 years, said Lt. Col. Miguel Angel Marazuela Martinez, chief of the service’s 23rd Instruction and Attack Wing at Talavera la Real Air Base.

“The [training] system that we have currently is quite solid, and it’s been evolving for many, many years, but we have to help it out,” he said during the panel. “And we are going to do it with this new plane.”

The service is also investing in advanced technologies, including biometrics, artificial intelligence and data fusion, to more accurately train its pilots, Marazuela Martinez said.

Helmets equipped with cutting-edge sensors and biometric watches will help instructors define “what is the best learning curve of every single student in a personalized way,” he added.

Helionix and legacy helicopters singled out for new Airbus services offers - Airbus,"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLTExLWhlbGlvbml4LWFuZC1sZWdhY3ktaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtc2luZ2xlZC1vdXQtZm9yLW5ldy1haXJidXMtc2VydmljZXMtb2ZmZXJz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Watch your fleet fly for decades longer. Have an expert at your side looking ahead. Such is the aim behind HCare Classics, Airbus Helicopters’ new service that responds to the unique needs expressed by operators of its legacy fleet of approximately 2,000 in-service H120, Dauphin, Puma and Gazelle helicopters.

HCare Classics

For a look at what the offer might bring to the 750 customers operating legacy aircraft, imagine a Dauphin operator in the southern United States who needs to expand into missions offshore. Their HCare Classics contract could help them develop a list of improvements to the helicopter, comply with new airworthiness regulations, and standardise all Dauphins in their fleet. Or picture a South American operator who’s spent time importing parts for its fleet of H120s and is a victim of its own success, trying to get spares and run operations too. If they had an HCare Classics contract, they could ensure an onsite field representative is there to optimise their spare parts logistics flows.

HCare Classics responds to the unique needs expressed by operators of its legacy fleet of approximately 2,000 in-service H120, Dauphin, Puma and Gazelle helicopters.

Tailoring the legacy experience

HCare Classics is a custom-made set of services for legacy operators with an ‘operator first’ premise. “Our aim in creating HCare Classics is to respond to the priorities we’ve been hearing from customers operating the H120, Dauphin, Puma and Gazelle, which make up a sizable portion of our fleet. That’s the reason you’ll see an approach that’s both customer-centric, results-based and derived from their feedback,” says Christoph Zammert, Executive Vice-President Support & Services at Airbus Helicopters.

The package brings a collaborative approach to operators’ fleet management, aiming to anticipate and treat issues of obsolescence and aircraft longevity. Perhaps most striking is the entirely new organisational model behind the offer, involving a dedicated plateau that brings together contract managers (as the voice of the customer) and product specialists, from design office experts to members of the supply chain.

To address former lags in its supply chain, Airbus Helicopters is investing both time and money to make it more robust: 10M€ to reinforce the supply chain, buy-back of used aircraft to source parts, committed production lead times to secure the availability of parts, and a 24/7 worldwide AOG and specialised parts transportation service.

All aspects of legacy helicopter operations are thus taken into account in a single contract, with performance commitments related to services that are performed by Airbus Helicopters.

HDataPower

Links in a (digital) chain

Digital can help operators optimise their operations by bringing savings in cost and time, as well as enhanced operational safety and greater fleet availability. To this end, Airbus Helicopters has launched an updated service package for Helionix aircraft (H135, H145, H160, and H175 ) called HDataPower that seamlessly integrates digital services throughout customers’ operations: an ‘uninterrupted digital chain’ of fleet monitoring, data analysis, troubleshooting and record-keeping.

HDataPower is a service package for Helionix aircraft (H135, H145, H160, and H175 ) that seamlessly integrates digital services throughout customers’ operations.

A day in the life

What would a day look like with HDataPower? Imagine you’re an operator with a fleet of ten rotorcraft. If you didn’t already have a data transfer means in place, Airbus would have proposed connectivity solutions such as wACS* and D-Box services. Then, during pre-flight checks, your pilots bring the maintenance history of the aircraft on their walkaround, via Fleet Keeper digital logbook. If they use it to report an issue, your airworthiness officer quickly schedules the aircraft for maintenance. Your pilot then conducts the flight with up-to-date aeronautical charts (the Aerodata Service). At the same time, the helicopter’s flight data (including HUMS*) are logged. The moment it lands, this is uploaded via wireless (wACS* connection) and consolidated as a report (FlyScan fleet monitoring). In the time it takes to upload data, you’ll know the real-time status of your fleet’s usage, dispatching, airworthiness and maintenance requirements.

Of course, many more services are woven into this end-to-end package, from the analysis of potential risks encountered during a flight (Flight Analyser), to a breakdown of fleet availability, with suggestions for scheduling maintenance (Fleet availability monitoring).

Time saved is money earned

“When we were designing this package of services, we wanted to make sure we were accompanying customers throughout their flight activities and bringing tangible added value,” says Christoph Zammert.

For example, for a fleet of around 10 aircraft, the Fleet Keeper and Flight Analyser services are estimated to save between 15 and 20 days of work for the operator, respectively. The HDataPower pack thus offers the optimal combination of digital services designed to make significant improvements to flight, airworthiness and maintenance operations.

Airbus: Eurodrone project ready for takeoff – as soon as the contract is signed - Defense News,"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbnNlbmV3cy5jb20vZ2xvYmFsL2V1cm9wZS8yMDIxLzExLzMwL2FpcmJ1cy1ldXJvZHJvbmUtcHJvamVjdC1yZWFkeS1mb3ItdGFrZW9mZi1hcy1zb29uLWFzLXRoZS1jb250cmFjdC1pcy1zaWduZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"STUTTGART, Germany – Industry officials are ready to move ahead to build the Eurodrone, Europe’s premier unmanned aerial system program, but the formal contract first needs one more signature.

A deal could be signed in the next “couple of months,” once all four partner nations have completed their review processes, said Daniela Lohwasser, chief Eurodrone engineer for Airbus Defence and Space, during a virtual media briefing on Tuesday.

“We have the green light from Germany, from Italy and from France, and we are in the waiting phase, basically every day now, on Spain,” Lohwasser said. Once Madrid is officially on board, “it will take maybe a couple of months more until we will be ready to finally go for the full contract signatures,” she added.

The industry partners — which include Airbus representing Germany and Spain, along with France’s Dassault Aviation and Italy’s Leonardo — are ready to sign the contract “from our side,” she noted. Airbus officials previously expected the contract to be signed in early 2021. Once the ink has dried, the industry partners face a tight schedule, with a preliminary design review expected to take place 18 months later, and a first flight within the following five years, Lohwasser added.

But that’s not the only big contract still pending. Airbus has yet to select an engine supplier for the Eurodrone program, and is weighing proposals from two vendors to build up to 120 propulsion systems, she said. “We are working on the finalization of the last offers. … The plan is that right after contract signature, we will announce the engine bidder, but not before.”

Lohwasser confirmed that the Eurodrone will have two engines, noting that while the up-front cost will be higher with the twin engine, there will be less maintenance required, and thus lower lifecycle costs. “We are seeing more and more unmanned vehicles with twin engines. ... I would say this is going to become the new market normal,” she said.

The Eurodrone program is expected to create over 7,000 jobs across its partner nations. In Spain and Germany, Airbus plans to employ over 1,000 new workers specifically for the project, Lohwasser said.

The medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) drone includes key partners Germany, France, Spain, and Italy, but Airbus expects more nations to join after a formal contract is signed. The four current partners have ordered 20 systems — which each include two ground stations and three aircraft — to ensure non-stop operation with one drone in the air, one in maintenance, and one ready to take off at all times, per Lohwasser. Germany has opted for seven systems, while Italy has committed to five, and Spain and France will each buy four systems.

Airbus Germany serves as the prime contractor and is in charge of the flight management and air-space integration system, along with the landing gear and the ground control stations. Meanwhile, Airbus Spain is designing and producing the fuselage and empennage systems, the ground safety critical control system, the safety-related and tactical communication assets, and the engine and fuel systems.

Dassault Aviation is in charge of developing the safe flight and landing system, mission communication, the air central maintenance system and the ground and mobile central maintenance systems. Last, Leonardo will design and produce the wing, as well as the airborne electrical and environmental control system, the airborne mission system, and the airborne armament system.

Final assembly will take place in Manching, Germany, Airbus announced last year.

While the program and engine contracts have yet to be formalized, Airbus has moved quickly to develop early designs. Eurodrone is expected to be over 52 feet long, and nearly 20 feet high with a 98-foot wingspan — about the size of an A320 airliner, Lohwasser noted.

The larger footprint will enable more flexibility for nations to choose which sensors to put on the platform, she added. Each system will include five stations to support weapons packages, additional fuel tanks, or other capabilities as befits the individual country’s needs.

“Whatever they will choose, the weapon systems are not part of this development,” Lohwasser said. “What we are doing is ... building provisions so that if later on, somebody wants to deploy something, it is possible.”

Eurodrone is also to be designed for civil air integration to allow for a wide range of missions. “We don’t have to go for detours to ensure that we reach this and that emergency location,” Lohwasser said. “Because of the high reliability and robustness, we can do direct flight path planning — this saves fuel and at the end, even CO2 emissions.”

Spanish Ministry of Defence signs order for three Airbus A330 MRTT - Airbus,"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0xMS1zcGFuaXNoLW1pbmlzdHJ5LW9mLWRlZmVuY2Utc2lnbnMtb3JkZXItZm9yLXRocmVlLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzMwLW1ydHTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Getafe, 12 November 2021 – The Spanish Ministry of Defence has signed the formal order for the acquisition of three Airbus A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport aircraft (MRTT).

Under the agreement, the handover of the first aircraft in transport configuration is scheduled in the coming days, followed by its conversion to MRTT in 2024. The handover of the first fully converted aircraft is scheduled in 2023 and the third and final unit in 2025.

The contract covers associated support such as spares, ground support equipment, training and in-service support until the end of the contract.

The aircraft, acquired from Iberia, will be converted into military tanker transport at Airbus’ Spanish headquarters in Getafe, Spain. It will be equipped with a state-of-the-art hose & drogue refuelling system and a specific Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC) kit. The A330 MRTT fleet will be operated by the Spanish Air Force 45 Wing, based in Torrejón Air Base (Madrid).

‘With the addition of A330 MRTT to its fleet, the Spanish Air Force acquires a key and proven new capability, that will enhance and support overseas operations, as well as medevac missions, on which the aircraft played a key role during the Covid-19 pandemic crisis worldwide,’said Jean-Brice Dumont, Executive Vice President Military Aircraft at Airbus.

The A330 MRTT is the only next generation strategic tanker and transport aircraft flying and available today. The large 111 tonnes / 245,000 lb basic fuel capacity of the successful A330-200 airliner, from which it is derived, enables the A330 MRTT to excel in Air-to-Air Refuelling missions without the need for additional fuel tanks.

Thanks to its wide-body fuselage, the A330 MRTT can also be used as a dedicated transport aircraft able to carry up to 300 troops, or a payload of up to 45 tonnes/99,000 lb. It can also easily be converted to accommodate light and intensive care stations for Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC).

With more than 250,000 flight hours achieved, the A330 MRTT counts 51 deliveries to 13 customers.

Airbus says forward A320 lav with tip-up seat is designated PRM lav - - Runway Girl Network,"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvYWlyYnVzLWEzMjEtbGF2YXRvcnktYWNjZXNzaWJsZS1kZXNpZ25hdGVkLXBybS1sYXYv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In September, Runway Girl Network published an article analysing the interiors of Lufthansa’s new Airbus A321neo, noting that the airline had eschewed a version of the Airbus Space-Flex lavatories — which convert two mini-lavatories against the back wall of the aircraft into a larger and more accessible lavatory — for standard, less accessible lavatories. Lufthansa confirmed to RGN at the time that “the washrooms are not fully accessible to wheelchair users.”

RGN was thus surprised to receive an email from an Airbus spokesperson insisting that the front lavatory, immediately behind the flight deck door ahead of door 1L, was a “designated PRM lav” — that is that it is designated for use by passengers of reduced mobility.

In the case of this particular A320 family 1L lavatory, Airbus’ assertion was, quite frankly, the first time that RGN had ever heard of this lavatory being designated as accessible.

Airbus provided RGN two images of this lavatory, and insisted that the photo share be on a not-for-publication basis.

To describe the photos of this lavatory, it appears to be a standard modern A320 family 1L lavatory with the addition of a single flip-down seat attached to the aft wall (Airbus calls this a transfer seat) and a single horizontal grab handle to the left of the transfer seat, also on the aft wall.

“Accessibility is provided by means of the tip-up seat which ensures the maneuvering inside the lavatory while the door can be kept closed which ensures privacy,” Airbus spokesperson Martin Fendt wrote to RGN in a statement.

RGN requested from Airbus a concept of operations document or similar guide explaining how it expects disabled passengers to conduct this manoeuvre, but one was not supplied. We are therefore left to imagine a method by which a wheelchair user is expected to physically manoeuvre themselves from the onboard aisle chair, through the open bifold door to the transfer seat, and then to the toilet.

This is certainly not the first time Airbus has employed a tip-up seat solution for PRMs. After first unveiling its Space-Flex v1 configuration for the A320 — which rearranged the footprint of the rear galley by placing the two lavatories together, catering to PRMs with a retractable partition between the two lavs that provides space for an aisle chair — the airframer later revealed Space-Flex v2 to offer enhanced galley space. And, as reported. by RGN in 2014, the v2 version is not nearly as PRM-friendly as the first version.

Airbus explained at the time: “For Space-Flex v2, the swinging partition separating the two v1 lavatories is replaced by a fixed partition featuring a tip-up seat. The wheelchair bound passenger transfers from the wheelchair to the tip-up seat and then, unassisted, to the toilet seat.”

There are different but linked questions about the layout of the Space-Flex v2 lavatory with tip-up seat at the rear of some A320 aircraft versus the layout of the 1L forward lavatory with tip-up seat. For instance, is it easier to manoeuvre around the lateral gangway of the former rather than the area near the flight deck? And what privacy is afforded to a wheelchair user navigating to the 1L forward lav’s tip-up seat? Is the passenger expected to transfer from the aisle chair in full view of other passengers?

Both designs seem to require that the wheelchair user has substantial strength and full use of their upper body.

The lavs are certainly at some remove from the kinds of accessible lavatories aboard other forms of long-distance transport — take the UK’s Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations 1998, for example, which have in the nearly 25 years since their implementation led to newly built rail vehicles being outfitted with fully accessible lavs, and older vehicles with useful life left in them being retrofitted. All these trains serve journey lengths well below that of a narrowbody aircraft, let alone the new extended-range narrowbodies.

Quite apart from the moral and ethical impetus of ensuring that all passengers have access to a lavatory, the question is presently particularly relevant with the US Department of Transportation’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) [PDF] on the subject.

“Airbus has designed the Airspace 1L Fwd Lavatory taking into account the current US regulation 14 CFR Part 382 and the proposed amendment of 14 CFR Part 382 for Single Aisle aircraft,” said the airframer in a statement to RGN.

“Furthermore all features recommended in the ICAO Doc 9984 (Manual on Access to Air Transport by Persons with Disabilities) are provided, accessible and usable from the toilet or transfer seat position while having the on-board wheelchair outside the lavatory.”

Airbus stated also that:

The 1L Fwd Lav is designed to meet these requirements proposed for future single aisle aircraft: Grab bars inside the lavatory.

Water faucets with either tactile information on the water temperature setting or a water temperature limit that prevents scalding.

Accessible attendants call buttons and door locks from a seated position inside the lavatory.

Lavatory controls and dispensers discernible through touch and one handed operation. No tight grasping, pinching or wrist twisting.

Door sill / threshold with minimum obstruction to an onboard wheelchair.

No reduction of toe clearance vs. today’s lavatories.

Visual barrier to afford privacy with an open lavatory door.

International Symbol of Accessibility only for lavatories capable of facilitating a seated independent transfer.

Airbus summarises the ICAO Doc 9984 that it referenced as follows: “Guidance for accessible washrooms is provided in paragraph 9.2. of the ICAO Doc 9984. The features defined there concerning identification, privacy, doors, toilets, grab bars, sinks, faucets and other controls, accessories, mirrors, and call buttons have been considered for the Airspace 1L Fwd Lav. All the recommended features are provided, accessible and usable from the toilet or transfer seat position while having the on-board wheelchair outside the lavatory.”

Reading the relevant section 9.2 of the document — and, it must be said, this document is a very unambitious definition of accessibility — Airbus’ assertion that ‘all the recommended features are provided’ begs further clarity from the airframer:

Doc 9984 refers to multiple grab bars in the plural throughout, including one behind the toilet. Only one grab bar is present. RGN is given to understand that Airbus considers the sink itself a grab bar.

Doc 9984 says that “persons with disabilities using an on-board wheelchair should be able to use the accessible washroom with privacy”. Given that the bifold door folds towards the front of the aircraft, it is presently unclear whether any hard or soft privacy measures block off from the rest of the cabin the visual of a passenger transferring from onboard chair to the transfer seat to the toilet.

Doc 9984 says that “door handles, pulls, latches, locks and other operational devices should be mounted at a height that a person in an on-board wheelchair can easily reach”, but these are not visible in the two photos that Airbus provided to RGN.

Doc 9984 says that “the sink should be positioned such that a person using an on-board wheelchair can use it easily”. The sink position and height do not appear to have been changed from a standard lavatory.

During followup emails, Lufthansa’s spokesperson now says “we can confirm that we consider the 1L A320s neo lavatory ‘accessible’, also for wheelchairs. The lavatory is registered as [an] official PRM lavatory.” Noted the spokesperson, “there is no other term we use than PRM lavatory.”

After the innovation of the original Space-Flex v1 lavatories with swinging partition — and the implementation of apparent versions of the design (note the latch on the inboard door above shoulder height onboard a Lufthansa A320neo) — it is disappointing that industry appears to be rowing back on accessibility.

When RGN consulted two well-regarded disabled passenger representatives on the specific matter of the 1L forward lavatory’s accessibility, their responses were scathing. If the 1L lavatory with tip-up seat is the standard to which even the proposed DOT NPRM revision is aiming, it is too low.

Airbus said the flight control computers being developed for CityAirbus by Thales and Diehl “will combine extraordinary computing power with lightweight design and highest safety standards.” Airbus Image

The partners announced their trilateral agreement on Nov. 17 at the European Rotors trade show in Cologne, Germany, where Airbus also unveiled a one-tenth scale model of CityAirbus Next Gen. The system partnership is the first to be announced for the aircraft, although Joerg Mueller, head of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) for Airbus, told eVTOL.com that others will be forthcoming.

“UAM is a joint effort,” Mueller stated in a press release. “Nobody can do it alone. Airbus is reaching out to potential partners from the industry to design and build an optimized vehicle for safe and efficient air transport in urban environments.”

Thales and Diehl will develop separate computing systems that will be integrated into a dissimilar architecture to comply with European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) requirements for eVTOL air taxis. Thales will be responsible for the primary flight control computer, while Diehl — a joint venture of Thales and Diehl Aviation — will create the secondary system. Their efforts will be supported with public funding from the French and German governments, respectively.

According to Airbus, the arrangement will ensure that the second, independent flight control computer monitors the data of the primary computer system, while also being able to take over flight control itself. Yannick Assouad, Thales’ executive vice president for avionics, said that this “safe and innovative flight control solution” will contribute to building trust in urban air mobility.

The fully electric CityAirbus NextGen was revealed in September at an Airbus summit on sustainable aerospace. The four-seat, winged multi-rotor aircraft features six propellers on wing-mounted booms, and two fixed-tilt propellers on a V-shaped tail.

It has a projected range of 80 kilometers (50 miles) and a cruise speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) — targets well below those of some competing developers, but nevertheless sufficient for the vast majority of intra-city UAM missions, Airbus claims. The company expects to perform the first flight of a prototype in 2023."
Airbus Explorer Maps Out Future for Commercial Cabins - Aviation Week,"Sun, 14 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9zaG93bmV3cy9kdWJhaS1haXJzaG93L2FpcmJ1cy1leHBsb3Jlci1tYXBzLW91dC1mdXR1cmUtY29tbWVyY2lhbC1jYWJpbnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has designated one of its three instrumented A350 test aircraft—MSN002—as Airspace Explorer, using it as a flying testbed to evaluate, demonstrate and certify its Airspace cabin design concepts. Because it is in the flying display, relatively few show visitors will have a chance to go on board, but those who do will get a first glimpse at the future of commercial air travel.

""You have a normal Airspace 350 cabin in there, but we have integrated four zones where you can see things that are not available today,” says Ingo Wuggetzer, Airbus vice president of cabin marketing. These include: a 65-in. OLED (organic light-emitting diode) screen dominating the aircraft’s entrance area; a system that projects images on the ceiling of the business-class area; a galley service that is digitally networked to enable cabin crew to allocate specific meal storage locations for each individual seat; and a system that allows passengers to control and store seat positioning using a smartphone and a QR code.

The Airspace cabin concept was introduced by Airbus in 2016 and immediately won several design awards. Appearing first on the A350, it is now available on narrowbody airliners, with JetBlue and Lufthansa the first airlines to operate A320s with Airspace cabins. Although some of the goals Airbus had for the concept were around giving their fleet a unified look and feel, the options for individual airlines to customize the cabin to their own requirements are considerable.

“Our philosophy is to deliver a great frame to the airline and they can paint their own picture on their canvas,” says Wuggetzer. He points to the contrast between the JetBlue aircraft, which are flying between London and New York, and the Lufthansa airplanes, which are being used on shorter-haul routes.

“JetBlue needed a great cabin for long-range flights,” he says, “so that’s what we designed for them. It really looks like a widebody. There are 10 different lighting scenarios with the same LED system we have in a 350. The lavatories look amazing. They have a business-class area designed like a boutique hotel. Lufthansa use that aircraft very differently - more a feeder aircraft into hubs. They have huge [luggage] bins with 40% more volume, which is perfect for feeders because it's easy to board and everybody's happy to put their luggage in there.”

But the concept is not just about improving the look and the comfort. Wuggetzer points out how some future aspirations—replacing in-flight entertainment screens with thin, flexible OLEDs, for instance—will save a lot of weight, and therefore feed in to both Airbus’ and their customers’ carbon-reduction efforts.

And the lessons of the COVID pandemic are also helping influence future design considerations. Wuggetzer says that academic and in-house studies prove an airplane cabin is a COVID-safe environment, but communicating that to anxious passengers is no easy task.

“Surfaces in lavatories have antimicrobial coatings, but nobody knows because the surface doesn't speak to them,” he says. “On MSN002 we've introduced a hygiene label as a first step,” Wuggetzer says. “So far, it’s the best idea to make [hygiene] visible. We put a nice logo near the entrance, and say that it's an Cleanspace hygiene label, then repeat it where we applied it. So you put them on the surfaces in the lavatory, on the wash table, on the side wall—people remember it. A lot of it is about perception and knowledge,” he adds."
Airbus’s Luxe ACH160 Helicopter Has an Autopilot System That Can Take Over in Rapid Descent - Robb Report,"Sun, 21 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbW90b3JzL2F2aWF0aW9uL2FpcmJ1cy1hY2gxNjAtaGVsaWNvcHRlci1mZWF0dXJlcy1hZHZhbmNlZC1hdXRvcGlsb3Qtc3lzdGVtLTEyMzQ2NDg0NTYv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly9yb2JicmVwb3J0LmNvbS9tb3RvcnMvYXZpYXRpb24vYWlyYnVzLWFjaDE2MC1oZWxpY29wdGVyLWZlYXR1cmVzLWFkdmFuY2VkLWF1dG9waWxvdC1zeXN0ZW0tMTIzNDY0ODQ1Ni9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"You’ll forget the generous cabin space, low decibel levels and the spine-coddling comfort of the supple leather seats. You’ll definitely forget the 68 patents that helped transform helicopter design. Because even in the ACH160, the world’s most luxurious helicopter, niceties go out the window when you’re in free fall over the ocean, blue water rushing up to meet you.

But in that moment, one of those 68 patents won’t forget you: The autopilot, in recovery mode, arrests the plummet, bringing the copter back to a stable flight. It’s a stunning show of technology for Airbus’s most advanced corporate helicopter, which will be delivered to a US client next year. Airbus will also complete the interior on this first ACH160, which I had a chance to experience in Monaco.

“This is the latest of a new generation designed from the passenger’s point of view,” says our test pilot, Olivier Gensse, who has been with the H160, the standard version of the ACH160, since the program’s inception. Between the sleek body, Fenestron tail rotor, spacious four-foot-four-inch cabin headroom, oversized windows and low vibration levels, it’s clear what he means.

During the simulated vortex-ring-state free fall, a condition where the helicopter’s rate of descent rapidly increases, Gensse pushed a button on the control stick twice that causes the machine’s automatic recovery mode to take over. Gensse also simulated an out-of-control flight in brownout conditions, resembling limited pilot visibility.

“Helicopter accidents often involve human error, especially if avionics are complicated,” Gensse says. “We designed the Helionix 3 system to be intuitive and simple, displaying critical information as needed. It’s about reducing the workload for the pilot without a hundred buttons on the display.” The ACH160 also has automated takeoff and a collision-avoidance system, both of which signify “a lot of new technology” incorporated into the design, according to Frédéric Lemos, chief executive of ACH. “We’ve had three prototypes flying, so many test hours have gone into the development.”

I also experienced the ACH160’s more civilized side, flying around Monte Carlo Harbor, with the Monaco Yacht Show in full swing. I imagined landing on one of the largest superyachts. Vibration and decibel levels were indeed low, especially after comparing it to an A125 in Las Vegas a few weeks later, and the bigger chopper’s executive cabin offered an entirely different experience—more town car than cramped clown car. And while the ACH160’s new owner chose the clean, corporate look of the ACH Line interior, other customized versions are also available."
CERES reconnaissance space system designed by Airbus and Thales successfully launched - Airbus,"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0xMS1jZXJlcy1yZWNvbm5haXNzYW5jZS1zcGFjZS1zeXN0ZW0tZGVzaWduZWQtYnktYWlyYnVzLWFuZC10aGFsZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Kourou, 16 November 2021 – The CERES space system (Capacité de Renseignement Electromagnétique Spatiale or Space-based Signal Intelligence Capability) satellites designed and built by Airbus Defence and Space and Thales for the French Armament General Directorate (DGA) have been successfully launched from the European spaceport in French Guiana, on-board a Vega launcher.

“We are ready to go with the next generation of space surveillance capability for France: CERES! Entrusting Airbus with the construction and full space system responsibility is a ringing endorsement of our expertise and the quality of our technology, acquired in particular from the ESSAIM and ELISA demonstrators,” said Jean Marc Nasr, Head of Space Systems at Airbus. “The three CERES satellites will provide France with its first satellite system for signal intelligence, thus confirming our ability to act as prime contractor for French space-based intelligence systems,” he continued.

CERES is designed to detect and geo-locate electromagnetic signals from radio communication systems and radars from areas where surface sensors cannot reach. From its low Earth orbit, CERES is free from airspace overflight constraints and can operate in all types of weather. The system will provide in-depth information to support military operations for the French Armed Forces, thus improving situational awareness.

“CERES will complete the French strategic and tactical defence intelligence capability with its first signal intelligence (SIGINT) satellite system. DGA trusts Thales to be in charge of the CERES end-to-end mission performance, for which we rely on our experience of more than 20 years in space-based SIGINT, especially with ESSAIM and ELISA, our unique know-how in satellite payloads and user ground segments, and our wide knowledge in SIGINT and electronic warfare in all environments”, said Philippe Duhamel, Executive Vice-President, Defence Mission Systems at Thales.

The system includes the space segment consisting of a swarm of three identical satellites carrying the SIGINT payload, as well as the user and ground control segments.

Airbus Defence and Space and Thales are co-contractors for the full end-to-end system. Airbus is responsible for the global system integration and the space segment comprising the three satellites, while Thales is responsible for full mission chain and system performance, going from on-board payload to user ground segment. In addition, Thales Alenia Space acted as a subcontractor to Airbus in supplying the satellites’ platforms. The French space agency, CNES, as assisting partner to the DGA, procured the launch services and the ground control segment.

CERES draws on Airbus and Thales’ experience acquired from the ESSAIM (communications intelligence) and ELISA (electronic intelligence) micro-satellite demonstrators launched in 2004 and 2011 respectively. The technical and operational lessons learnt from these systems were key to enabling the very high performance in electromagnetic detection and compatibility, demanded by this mission.

The demonstration flight used two A350 aircraft, MSN1 and MSN59, the former as the leader aircraft and the latter as the follower just 3km (1.8 miles) behind and took place on November 9, 2020.

The flight is the first to be conducted in general air traffic regulated transatlantic airspace at such a close distance using commercial passenger aircraft.

According to Airbus more than six tons of carbon dioxide emissions were saved on the trip, confirming the potential for more than a 5% fuel saving on long-haul flights.

The fello’fly project was launched in 2019 within Airbus’ UpNext subsidiary to prove that the concept of Wake Energy Retrival (WER) could safely reduce fuel burn and emissions of aircraft. WER is a natural phenomenon observed in migrating birds such as geese, which fly in a “V” formation in the updraft of air the wake creates from a leader.

Flight control systems developed by Airbus engineers enable the follower aircraft to safely fly in the wake updraft of the leader aircraft allowing it to reduce engine thrust and reduce fuel consumption.

Sabine Klauke, chief technical officer at Airbus said, “This demonstration flight is a concrete example of our commitment to making our decarbonization roadmap a reality. It also speaks to how collaboration across the industry will be key to making this happen.

“We have received a strong level of support for this project from our airline and air traffic partners, plus regulators. The opportunity to get this deployed for passenger aircraft around the middle of this decade is very promising.

“Imagine the potential if fello’fly was deployed across the industry.”

Pilots from Airbus partner airlines SAS Scandinavian Airlines and Frenchbee witnessed the transatlantic flight onboard as observers. The project and this week’s flight also involved air traffic management partners, air navigation service providers and the French aerospace research agency DGAC to show that a flight with WER can be achieved without compromising safety.

Previous tests Airbus conducted in 2016 showed that WER could reduce the amount of fuel used by airlines by up to 10%.

Airbus said the next step for the project is to obtain approval from civil aviation authorities so that the WER operational concept can be certified for wide industry use.

Review: SAS Plus Airbus A320neo - One Mile at a Time,"Sun, 07 Nov 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL3Jldmlld3Mvc2FzLXBsdXMtYTMyMG5lby_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After four lovely nights in Stockholm, it was time to fly to our next destination, Nice. We flew there on Scandinavian Airlines (SAS), which is one of the more unusual airlines in Europe in terms of its premium product.

How I booked our Scandinavian Airlines flights

For the day we were traveling, the only airline flying nonstop from Stockholm to Nice was SAS. Unfortunately there was no award availability, so we just booked a paid ticket on the following flight:

07/05 SK1827 Stockholm to Nice departing 6:00AM arriving 9:05AM

An SAS Go ticket cost $250 per person, while an SAS Plus ticket cost $300 per person, so we spent the extra $50 for SAS Plus. While the fare as such wasn’t cheap, I thought the premium was reasonable for SAS Plus, and this also seemed like the most efficient option. Any mileage redemption option would have involved $100+ in fees, and if I can avoid connections within Europe I do.

What is SAS Plus?

Business class within Europe isn’t much to get excited about, as it typically just consists of economy with a blocked middle seat, and free food and drinks. Scandinavian Airlines doesn’t even have business class on flights within Europe, though, but rather just has SAS Plus, which is more of a premium economy product.

What is SAS Plus?

It offers seating in a dedicated section at the front of the plane, but there are no blocked middle seats

It includes complimentary coffee and tea, plus a free snack; on top of that, you can order off the buy on board menu for free, though this is generally not encouraged by the crew, and also isn’t even listed on SAS’ website as a benefit

It includes priority ground services, including priority check-in, fast track security, lounge access, and priority boarding

It offers free Wi-Fi onboard

The reality is that if you have Star Alliance Gold status, the perks of SAS Plus are minimal, since that status offers all airport priority services. The main reason we decided to pay for SAS Plus is because the back of the plane looked packed, while SAS Plus looked mostly empty. So while a blocked middle seat isn’t an official benefit of SAS Plus, I was hoping we’d luck out with one.

Scandinavian Airlines check-in Stockholm Airport

With our flight departing at 6AM, we decided to arrive at the airport at 3:45AM. Why so early? A friend had flown out of the airport a day prior for an early morning flight. He arrived two hours before his flight, and said he almost missed it, so we figured we should play it safe. It’s at least a little easier to get up before 3AM in Northern Europe in summer, when it’s already starting to get light at that hour.

This also gets at one of my airline pet peeves when it comes to managing expectations — Scandinavian Airlines has a bank of 6AM flights, and recommends getting to the airport two hours before departure. Go figure check-in doesn’t open until exactly two hours before departure. That meant when we arrived at the airport we had to get in a single queue with hundreds of people.

Scandinavian Airlines check-in queue Stockholm Airport

Once check-in opened, the line at least moved pretty quickly, given that we had access to the priority check-in desk (it wasn’t possible to check-in online, I guess because our vaccination cards had to be inspected). I thought the sign on the check-in desk about treating staff with respect was interesting.

Scandinavian Airlines signage at check-in counter

We were quickly issued our boarding passes, and headed through security, which didn’t take much time. All the shops in the terminal were still closed.

Stockholm Arlanda Airport departures hall

While we had lounge access, the lounge didn’t open until 5AM. So we just walked around a bit and did some plane spotting, and then had a seat in the gate area to get some work done.

Scandinavian Airlines lounge Stockholm Airport

The whole ground experience at Arlanda Airport seemed like an exercise in lining up. We were told to check-in two hours before departure, only for check-in to only open exactly two hours before departure. Then the lounge only opens one hour before the first departure. There were many dozen people ahead of us in line to access the lounge, so we had to queue for about 15 minutes to even get into the lounge when it opened.

Scandinavian Airlines lounge queue

Then once inside the lounge we had to queue for the breakfast buffet, since everyone who first queued to get into the lounge was now queueing for the buffet.

The breakfast spread seemed to be the same as pre-coronavirus, which was fine, but nothing to get excited about.

The lounge itself was perfectly fine, but between first lining up to get into the lounge, and then lining up for the breakfast buffet, we had just a few minutes in the lounge before it was time to head to our departure gate.

SAS A320neo business class cabin & seats

Our SAS flight was departing from gate 12, a short walk from the lounge. Boarding was scheduled to start at 5:30AM. While priority boarding is marketed as a benefit of SAS Plus, the airline was at the time using a back-to-front boarding process, so SAS Plus passengers were asked to board last.

Our flight was operated by an Airbus A320neo, which is the backbone of Scandinavian Airlines’ short haul fleet. SAS’ A320s feature a total of 174 seats. I had assigned us seats 9D & 9F, the window and aisle seat on the right side in the last row of the SAS Plus section.

SAS has slimline seats, with 30-31″ of pitch. The legroom wasn’t great (definitely not as good as on our previous flight on a KLM 737), but it wasn’t terrible either.

SAS has USB outlets at every seat, though there are no 110v outlets. Some power is better than none, but I just don’t get why airlines can’t offer more power options on newly delivered planes. Do they think personal electronic devices are going away, or are they just cheap and don’t care?

There was a standard tray table that folded out from the seat in front. The literature pocket was on top of the tray table, so that the reading materials were exposed when the tray table was lowered.

On the plus side, there were individual air nozzles at every seat — on European airlines this is more common on narrow body aircraft than wide body aircraft.

SAS Plus individual air nozzles Airbus A320neo

There was no curtain between SAS Plus and SAS Go, but rather there was just a small sign on the back of our seat indicating that the SAS Go section started behind our row.

Our gamble of booking SAS Plus paid off — while every single seat in SAS Go was occupied, there were over a dozen empty seats in SAS Plus, including the seat between us.

Departing Stockholm

The main cabin door closed at 6AM, and at 6:05AM we began our pushback. At that point the manual safety demonstration was performed. Based on sunlight outside, you would’ve thought it was the middle of the day.

Pushing back at Stockholm Arlanda Airport

We had a quick taxi to our departure runway, and by 6:10AM we were airborne for our 2hr50min flight to Nice.

SAS Plus food & drinks

The seatbelt sign was turned off about five minutes after takeoff. Shortly thereafter the crew began service. SAS Plus isn’t a proper intra-Europe business class product, but rather just offers more service than in the standard economy cabin. After takeoff, disinfecting wipes were distributed.

Then about 10 minutes later a complimentary breakfast box was served.

SAS Plus breakfast box

It was better than nothing, but wasn’t a terribly exciting selection — there was some yogurt and granola, a small amount of cheese and some packaged bread, and a can of juice.

SAS Plus meal service

Passengers were also offered complimentary coffee & tea, served in cups.

SAS Plus drink service

Interestingly SAS Plus passengers can allegedly also order for free off the buy on board menu. However, this isn’t listed on the SAS website as a benefit of SAS Plus, and for that matter the crew didn’t offer or encourage it. So at the time I didn’t even know this was possible, not that I would have ordered a whole lot else on such an early morning flight. Below is the buy on board menu.

SAS inflight menu

That was the extent of the service — there was no offer of refills or further service.

SAS Plus Wi-Fi

One of the other advantages of SAS Plus is complimentary Wi-Fi. Connecting was easy, and the airline has Wi-Fi provided by Viasat, which has exceptionally good speeds. While there’s not much else to get excited about on SAS, having high speed and free Wi-Fi is awesome, and it allowed me to stay productive during the flight.

SAS Plus service

There’s not a whole lot to say about the service on SAS. Like I said, the crew made a single pass through the cabin. The crew wasn’t rude in any way, though also wasn’t polite in any way.

The extent of my interaction with the crew was them asking “coffee or tea?” and me saying “coffee with milk, please.”

SAS Plus lavatory

There was a lavatory at the front of the cabin. This was open to all passengers, since there’s no divider between SAS Plus and SAS Go. The lavatory was fairly clean, but otherwise no frills.

Approaching Nice

At around 8:30AM we began our descent into Nice. The views of the French coastline are always gorgeous. The seatbelt sign was turned on about 15 minutes later.

View approaching Nice

We touched down in Nice at 9AM, and from there we had a five minute taxi to our arrival gate.

Touching down in Nice

Taxiing Nice Airport

There were no arrival formalities of any sort, so we headed straight for our hotel, with most of the day still ahead of us.

Bottom line

Flying within Europe isn’t much to get excited about, and that’s especially true on Scandinavian Airlines. The airline doesn’t offer business class, but rather offers a premium economy product of sorts.

SAS Plus offers priority airport services, a dedicated seating area at the front of the plane, an onboard snack along with coffee & tea, and free Wi-Fi. Apparently you can also order items off the buy on board menu for free, but what a ridiculous system — the crew doesn’t tell you about it, and it’s not even listed on the website as a benefit, so I guess it’s kept a secret so the airline can save money.

In our case taking this flight made sense — it was a direct routing, the A320neo cabin was in pretty good shape, and there was high speed Wi-Fi and USB power outlets.

Furthermore, on our flight I think it was worth booking SAS Plus over SAS Go, given the modest price premium. This ended up getting us an empty middle seat, since SAS Go was 100% full, while SAS Plus wasn’t. While I think SAS Plus can be a good deal, in general I’d prefer to fly an airline that has an intra-Europe business class, since having a guaranteed blocked middle is nice.

If you’ve flown SAS Plus, what was your experience like?"
"'Outlook starting to brighten' for aviation, Airbus CEO says - Tech Xplore","Mon, 15 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHhwbG9yZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTExLW91dGxvb2stYnJpZ2h0ZW4tYXZpYXRpb24tYWlyYnVzLWNlby5odG1s0gFMaHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoeHBsb3JlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEtMTEtb3V0bG9vay1icmlnaHRlbi1hdmlhdGlvbi1haXJidXMtY2VvLmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An Airbus A350 XWB aircraft performs a demonstration flight at the 2021 Dubai Airshow in the Gulf emirate on November 15, 2021.

The global aviation sector has begun to emerge from the Covid pandemic, its worst-ever crisis, and the ""outlook is starting to brighten"", Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury told journalists Monday.

A large order of 255 of Airbus' single-aisle A231 planes announced Sunday at the Dubai Airshow ""completely justifies"" a shift to ramping up manufacturing, the CEO said, predicting production of long-haul planes could pick up by the second half of the decade.

On Monday, US Air Lease signed a letter of intent for 111 Airbus aircraft, the manufacturer said.

Faury spoke to journalists, including AFP, on the sidelines of the Dubai Airshow. The following is a summarised and translated version of his comments in French:

Has the airline sector recovered?

""The crisis was very brutal, lasting 15 months at its worst stage. We are in the process of emerging, we can see aerial traffic recovering, the reopening of travel lines, the planes travelling here to Dubai were full or nearly full.

""The United States has largely resumed, Europe is also resuming. Asia will probably take a little longer, but globally the figures point to a recovery in the global economy and air traffic.

""When we say we are on the way out of the crisis, it is because we are coming back from the low point, we are progressively climbing back up.

""Airbus began the gradual recovery some months ago on short and medium-haul aircraft, the A320 family, but not on long-haul aircraft.

""We continue to believe that we can return to 2019-level air traffic at some point between 2023 and 2025—regionally likely in 2023 and internationally in 2025.

""We are much more optimistic because the outlook is starting to brighten.

""We can see from yesterday's order that the airlines are also starting to look to the horizon and prepare for a post-crisis situation.""

Is the order for 255 A321 a sign?

""We quickly understood in 2020 that airlines and charter companies did not want to make decisions during the crisis that would have had too great of an impact on their future growth and their ability to remain key players.

""At the start of 2021, I said that I was not expecting big orders in 2021 and they would come in 2022.

""There are exceptions that prove the rule. We are in discussion with several players that are positioning themselves more quickly than others.

""We are in a recovery scenario that is not very different from what we had imagined.

""This confirms that the value of access to aircraft production is very important for the big players in aviation.""

Will the order reassure other manufacturers?

""It completely justifies the ramp-ups we are anticipating.

""We are in the process of determining whether a ramp-up in the production to 70 and 75 will go on,"" he said referring to the number of new A320 and A321 aircraft per month in the summer of 2025.

""For the entire supply chain, it is a difficult moment, but (the ramp-ups) are clearly an opportunity.

""We think that for the second half of the decade, it is quite probable that what is happening with medium-haul aircraft will happen with long-haul aircraft because there will have seen five or six years of very weak deliveries.

""Many planes have been placed in long-term storage, some of which will be retired, which will create a deficit of new, high performance, fuel-efficient planes.

""Therefore, it is likely that there will be a strong ramp-up of long-haul aircraft at some point during the second half of the decade.""

H160: A step-change in support - Airbus,"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLTExLWgxNjAtYS1zdGVwLWNoYW5nZS1pbi1zdXBwb3J00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The H160’s standard-setting maintenance and support concept is among the aircraft’s many innovations. It has undergone fine-tuning in an Operator Zero campaign with Airbus as the “first operator.” It elevates commonplace needs like component accessibility to the fore. Its training and technical documentation are practical and visual. And it sought to integrate digital solutions from the design phase to maintenance, ensuring these solutions communicate with each other. Let’s take a closer look.

Airbus is fine-tuning the maintenance and support activities for H160 helicopters with its Operator Zero campaign, in which the company acts as the “first operator.”

Support 101: from design to end user

“We anticipated the H160’s entry into service by defining a clear support specification at the beginning of the programme,” says Laurence Di Costanzo, head of H160 support. The programme did this by having the Support department work with the Design team so development choices were guided in an integrated manner.

Feedback from operators with different needs and requirements (search and rescue, law enforcement, oil industry, etc.) was taken into account when defining the H160’s maintenance plan, for which Airbus applied the MSG-3 inspection methodology required by the EASA and FAA. The in-depth study of maintenance intervals and accessibility helped safely eliminate minor tasks, leading to a significant reduction in workload. With this combination of flexibility and scope, the plan covers customers’ maintenance needs according to operational requirements.

Having in-house support teams do the work of operators – testing tasks, equipment and tools during Operator Zero campaigns – has corroborated the maintenance plan for short intervals. (For example, maintenance was tested in a harsh desert environment during the H160’s flight test campaign in Morocco.) This validation will continue after entry into service for longer intervals, resulting in an H160 with competitive operating costs and flexible maintenance.

One of Airbus’ priorities for the H160 has been making this medium helicopter’s key components more accessible to maintenance technicians.

Within reach: maintenance in the field

The H160 will be stationed in the field on certain types of missions. The programme used this as inspiration to develop a maintenance concept that facilitates its upkeep far from base. This involved simplifying visual checks, without the need for heavy tools.

Careful thought has gone into the helicopter’s access points as well. The nose avionics bay opens directly onto batteries, fans and air conditioning sensors so technicians can check these vital components. Cowlings on the central fuselage open without tools, and technicians can reach the upper deck (via footsteps) to carry out their inspection of the main rotor at eye level. The upshot: operators gain autonomy in caring for the helicopter as well as maximising its availability on the road.

Innovative, interactive training

The programme and training tools for H160 technicians and pilots are an extension of the aircraft. Interactive and intuitive, the system emulators and the Helionix trainer make it easier to understand all onboard systems by simulating their operation and malfunctions; the component locator is used to train technicians and pilots on the location of components. Hands-on training for a series of models and physical parts, essential despite the improvement of digital tools, allows technicians to work through different tasks.

For pilot training, there is the H160 Level D full flight simulatorand a cockpit procedures trainer which, due to its immersive environment, ensures an efficient transition from theory to practice.

Airbus Helicopters has established a strong, versatile training model across its network of customer centres, and training means will be making their way to points across the globe. The OEM will send technician training rigs directly to Japan – the first such event outside of Europe – while Japanese training instructors have begun their familiarisation of the H160’s controls, features and handling qualities in an FFS cockpit.

H160 pilot training benefits from a cockpit procedures trainer, which ensures an efficient transition from theory to practice.

Precision and visualisation with 3D

The new generation of technical documentation uses extremely precise 3D illustrations, with a minimum of text. With the O.R.I.O.N. digital reader, it is also available offline, on digital tablets, making it accessible at any time and everywhere. Thanks to digital continuity, the illustrations are automatically updated when maintenance manuals are revised. The accuracy of 3D visuals removes ambiguity and prevents misinterpretation. ""It’s a powerful safety factor for the customer,"" says Di Costanzo.

Digital and connected in all phases of operation

The H160 benefits from a connected ecosystem to support flight operations, airworthiness and maintenance activities. Via onboard connectivity solutions, data such as usage and health information are transferred to a cloud-based server for analysis on the ground, helping operators simplify their operations and make the most of their fleet’s data. Each phase of an operation is supported, from flight preparation to in-flight pilot assistance, post-flight debriefing and maintenance planning, leading to greater time savings, reduced risk of human error and improved aircraft availability and operational safety. Informing the rationale behind this digital environment, data is made available to the right team at the right moment.

3D technical publications for Airbus’ H160 give technicians the necessary information to maintain this helicopter to the highest standards.

A flight manual with benefits

The digital flight manual, or c-RFM (computerised rotorcraft flight manual), provides the crew with any information they need on aircraft performance in terms of weather conditions, options, required flight profile, etc. Airbus Helicopters is the first helicopter manufacturer to have designed and certified a flight manual equipped with a calculation app. The c-RFM digitises and automates calculation tasks given to the crew, which improves safety and performance levels as the c-RFM includes the exact configuration of the aircraft recorded by the app in the calculation. Installed on a touch-screen tablet, the tool is intuitive and user friendly. It also enables the integration of all PDF technical and operational documentation (checklists, operation manuals, etc.), avoiding the need to carry hundreds of pages in the cockpit.

“The development of a new helicopter is always an exciting journey and with the H160 this is even more so,” says Laurence Di Costanzo. “We are committed to making customers’ missions a success from the start.”"

Airbus takes off with big order on first day of Dubai Airshow - Tech Xplore,"Sun, 14 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHhwbG9yZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTExLWFpcmJ1cy1iaWctZGF5LWR1YmFpLWFpcnNob3cuaHRtbNIBRGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHhwbG9yZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTExLWFpcmJ1cy1iaWctZGF5LWR1YmFpLWFpcnNob3cuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Two men stand next to an Acropolis Aviation Airbus A320-251N aircraft, with an Emirates Airbus A380 aircraft in the background, at the 2021 Dubai Airshow in the Gulf emirate on November 14, 2021.

Airbus came out strongly at the Dubai Airshow on Sunday with a group order for 255 single-aisle A321 aircraft, marking the first major deal of its kind since the pandemic began.

The European plane-maker's announcement came shortly after its American rival Boeing said it would fulfil an order to convert 11 single-aisle 737s into cargo aircraft, and as the aviation industry slowly recovers from a Covid-induced downturn.

Airbus said the order came from Wizz Air, Frontier, Volaris and JetSMART—all from US company Indigo Partners—for a total value of more than $33 billion, according to the latest list price published by Airbus in 2018.

The total cost of the order was not disclosed, but list rates are rarely applied to large deliveries.

Hungarian low-cost carrier Wizz Air will receive 102 aircraft, American Frontier Airlines will receive 91, while 39 will go to Mexico's Volaris and 23 to Chilean JetSMART.

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said that because the four companies fall under the same aviation-focused equity firm, it allowed for a large order and for an attractive price, adding: ""It's a give and take situation.""

Deliveries are set to begin in 2025.

Wanted 'to be early'

Representatives of the embattled aviation industry flocked to the Dubai Airshow on Sunday as the sector emerges from coronavirus pandemic travel restrictions and faces pressure to reduce its impact on climate change.

The five-day event in the United Arab Emirates is the industry's first large gathering since Covid-19 clipped its wings last year, as border closures left airports deserted and hundreds of aircraft idle.

Air traffic has since bounced back, though it was still 53 percent lower in September compared to pre-pandemic levels.

Commenting on Sunday's deal, Indigo Partners chief Bill Franke said the company wanted ""to be early in the (recovery) process"".

Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer and head of Airbus International, said the Indigo Partners airlines had ""acted fast and decisively over the last few months to position themselves for this landmark order as the effect of the pandemic recedes and the world wants more sustainable flying"".

Airbus also said Sunday that the UAE's air force ordered two additional A330 Multi-role Tanker Transport (MRTT) aircraft, bringing the number of MRTT planes among its fleet to five.

'Nascent phenomenon'

Boeing meanwhile announced it had signed a contract with an Icelandic company to convert 11 single-aisle 737 aircraft into cargo planes.

The American plane-maker did not disclose the value of the contract with Icelease to convert 11 Boeing 737-800BCFs—previous generation of the MAX series—into cargo aircraft.

To meet growing demand, Boeing said it would open three new freighter conversion lines in Canada and the United Kingdom, in addition to those recently opened in China and Costa Rica.

""It was a nascent phenomenon before Covid. Pre-Covid, we just couldn't put enough 737 (cargo planes) out there to satisfy the market,"" Ted Colbert, CEO of Boeing Global Services, told reporters in Dubai.

The aviation industry has weathered the global supply chain crisis that has created headaches for the shipping industry.

But amid a slump in global air traffic, during which traditionally half of all air freight was carried in the holds of passenger aircraft, airlines have turned to cargo planes.

And with a decrease in air traffic during the pandemic, hundreds of planes have been abandoned—particularly older generation ones—which could potentially be turned to cargo aircraft.

Boeing said in a statement it forecast 1,720 freighter conversions over the next 20 years to meet demand, adding it has ""more than 200 orders and commitments from 19 customers"".

While wide-body aircraft, such as the Boeing 777, 767 and A350 have their own cargo versions, single-aisle aircraft such as the 737 do not.

Is Airbus on the cusp of unveiling wider A350 cabin? - - Runway Girl Network,"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvYWlyYnVzLXdpZGVuaW5nLXRoZS1hMzUwLWNhYmluLTQwMC1zZWF0ZXItMy00LTNzLWhhcHBlbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Is Airbus about to unveil a wider A350 cabin in the interest of making the ten-abreast layout on board its latest widebody twinjet palatable to airlines beyond the leisure and low-cost market — and to compete with Boeing’s 777X? An aside remark at the Dubai Airshow this week suggests that it might be coming down the line in Toulouse, and soon.

A fascinating exchange between an executive (Runway Girl Network presumes of Etihad Airways) and Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, chief executive officer of Emirates, on board Etihad’s second Airbus A350 was posted online.

الشيخ أحمد بن سعيد آل مكتوم الرئيس الأعلى الرئيس التنفيذي لـ #طيران_الإمارات والمجموعة، برفقة السيد/ توني دوغلاس الرئيس التنفيذي لمجموعة #الإتحاد_للطيران يطلعان على مقصورة ومنتجات أحدث طائرات #الإتحاد_للطيران طراز الإيرباص #A350 على هامش #معرض_دبي_للطيران_2021 pic.twitter.com/KkitedhW0G — سالم بن تميم الريامي (@bin_tamim_salim) November 14, 2021

“This machine… 372 seats… interestingly the second batch of them after the first five are very slightly wider on the airframe, so in economy we have an extra one seat per row, so it goes up to 404 seats,” said the executive, who RGN has not been able to identify.

Etihad’s economy class cabin on this aircraft, as shown in the video, is a 3-3-3 configuration, beginning immediately after doors 2 on the A350-1000, and the carrier has no premium economy product.

So how could this wider cabin come about? RGN assumes that this is further development of the work revealed ahead of the last Paris Air Show in 2019, by chief commercial officer Christian Scherer, then new in post. Scherer promised access to a new cabin mockup where, he promised, “with an enhanced cabin you can very comfortably go to 10-abreast seating in economy class on this airplane for long-range flying”. (Snug 10-across configs are presently flown by leisure/low-cost carriers like Frenchbee and Air Caraïbes.)

Airbus clammed up about the new mockup and the cabin two years ago, but Scherer later doubled down on his assertions about ten-abreast A350 comfort to RGN. In previous years, Airbus has cited 16.4” as the width of a ten-abreast A350 seat, but in recent times it has used a 17” number.

If there are indeed changes, RGN assumes that they are in essence, slimming down the A350’s sidewalls — at least in the economy cabin — to eke out extra cabin width within the existing A350 fuselage diameter, while tweaking seats.

Indeed, when Airbus first began discussing its comfort work for the 10-abreast A350 — way back in 2015 — an executive with the airframer said: “[Y]ou can play with the angles on the sidewalls and you can play a little with the armrest and then you can be very clever with the design of the seat.”

Airbus presently cites the A350-1000’s cabin width at 5.61m within the fuselage width of 5.96m, leaving some 35 centimetres, or 17.5cm (6.89 inches) on each side, as space within the fuselage but unused by the cabin.

It’s unclear how much of this space (17.5cm or 6.89 inches, roughly the diagonal size of your author’s iPhone) can reasonably be carved out to make a difference for passengers. The A350, after all, is not a nearly 30-year-old airframe like the 777, and one assumes that Airbus didn’t wantonly ignore cabin width when designing and building the aircraft.

It’s also unclear as to whether this potential change would affect all aircraft after a certain point in time (in other words, after a certain MSN number in the production line), or whether it would be optional.

RGN asked Airbus’ press team in Dubai a list of questions about the matter, including asking how the aircraft is wider, whether this was an Etihad-specific change, an “all aircraft after MSN XXX” change or “optional after MSN XXX” change, details of full cabin width, which variants were affected, and whether there were any other changes implicated.

Aeron Haworth, Airbus’ Media Relations Manager for UK and Widebody topics, responded only: “As a leading aircraft manufacturer, we are in constant dialogue with our customers, listening to their (fleet) requirements. We are always looking into advancing our products, including cabin definition. However, we keep our talks with customers confidential.”

This is, perhaps, sensible from a marketing point of view. Airbus will not wish to repeat what happened the last time that it put a densified cabin with questionable comfort up in the view of the industry, let alone journalists, with the proposed eleven-abreast A380 cabin. Nonetheless, at some point journalists will need to be shown this cabin, and for any comfort assertions to be scrutinised.

Emirates Is Selling Off Pieces of Its First Airbus A380 — Including Its Iconic Bar - Travel + Leisure,"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFuZGxlaXN1cmUuY29tL3RyYXZlbC1uZXdzL2VtaXJhdGVzLXNlbGxpbmctcGllY2VzLW9mLXJldGlyZWQtYWlyYnVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If you're an aviation geek shopping for a truly one-of-a-kind gift, this sale is for you.

Emirates Airline is selling off pieces of a retired A380 aircraft, giving you the chance to turn pieces of aviation history into household items you can treasure for a lifetime.

The Airbus A380 was the first plane in the Emirates fleet, and select items already are available for pre-order at the Dubai Airshow, which runs through Nov. 18. But you'll have to wait to get your hands on the plane's iconic onboard bar.

That gorgeous piece will be sold via online auction. Details have yet to be announced.

The round bar would have been the centerpiece of the plane's onboard cocktail lounge, a stylish space on its top deck, and served only first and business class Emirates passengers.

For now, you'll be able to select from items including a coffee table made from an A380 wheel, a gold-plated first class cabin logo, a clock made from a wing fuel panel, or the plane's soaring 79-foot-tall tail, which bears an image of the United Arab Emirates flag.

Emirates is working with two firms, Wings Craft Furniture and Falcon Aircraft Recycling, to recycle the plane's parts. And it's likely you'll have more options to shop as time goes on.

""The work to break down the aircraft is still underway at our facility, following the strictest regulatory guidelines and best practice to minimise waste and environmental impact,"" Falcon Aircraft Recycling Andrew Tonks said in a statement shared with Travel + Leisure. ""This is a special aircraft that deserves a meaningful second life.""

Customers do have the option to create bespoke pieces from the plane's parts and can consult with recycling teams by emailing sales@wingscraftshop.com.

A portion of the profits are being directed to the Emirates Airline Foundation, the airline's charity organization.

Airbus issues “conservative” post-COVID forecast - Leeham News and Analysis,"Sat, 13 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8xNC9haXJidXMtaXNzdWVzLWNvbnNlcnZhdGl2ZS1wb3N0LWNvdmlkLWZvcmVjYXN0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Judson Rollins

Introduction

November 13, 2021, © Leeham News: On the eve of the Dubai Air Show, Airbus released the first edition of its annual Global Market Forecast (GMF) since the COVID-19 crisis began.

The manufacturer sees approximately 39,000 passenger aircraft with 100+ seats and freighters being produced by 2040. 29,690 will be small aircraft, 5,340 medium, and 3,990 large. Airbus’s category definitions now take both size and range into account; the A321XLR is categorized as a “medium” airplane, reflecting its inroads into routes currently operated by smaller widebodies.

Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer said that Airbus took a “corridor” approach to forecasting a global traffic recovery using high and low scenarios. In the low case, traffic would recover to 2019 levels by 2023, or 2025 in the high case. He said the high scenario is basically an extrapolation of recent traffic trends across key markets.

He expressed optimism that the wave of COVID-driven order cancellations had peaked. “The resilience of our industry has been remarkable. Owners continue to believe in their investments and put capital into their fleets.”

Global traffic expected to recover between 2023 and 2025

Airbus sees a two-year permanent lag in demand growth versus the pre-pandemic trendline but does see global traffic returning to 3.9% annual growth, down from 4.3% previously.

Scherer repeatedly emphasized the level of “conservatism” in the company’s forecast, pointing out that Boeing’s competing Current Market Outlook (CMO) assumes a larger replacement market. He expressed optimism for replacement trends, saying that average replacement age has decreased by 2-3 years in recent years.

Airbus raised its expectation for replacement aircraft to 40% of total production, up from 33% in its 2019 GMF. It attributes a large portion of its replacement forecast to a global push for increased sustainability and that 13% of airplanes currently service use previous-generation engine technology.

Scherer pushed back on assertions by a Boeing executive at a previous media briefing that Airbus is “flooding the market” with single-aisle aircraft beyond what market demand can absorb. “We’re not the ones controlling the marketplace. We’re in an industry that builds to order.”

Freighter market to be dominated by conversions

The European manufacturer sees demand for 2,440 freighters including conversions, of which 1,490 are expected to be replacements. 880 are expected to be new builds. Express freight is forecast to grow by 4.7% per year, while general cargo (comprising 75% of the market) will grow 2.7% annually.

Scherer said, “Yes, there is a bit of a frenzy around dedicated freighters, but the airplanes available today aren’t the most efficient available today. So, there will be a rapid erosion in the residual values in the [freighters] being delivered today.”

He declined to comment on any further native-build freighter products under consideration.

Services market expected to resume pre-COVID trend

Airbus’ pre-pandemic forecast of around $4.8 trillion of services over the next 20 years was maintained despite a COVID-related dip of 20% through year 2025 period. It still foresees a need for more than 550,000 new pilots and 710,000 technicians over the next 20 years.

Credit: ©Airbus.

Airbus has received an order from the Indonesia Ministry of Defence (MoD) for two A400M military transport jets in multirole tanker and transport (MRTT) configuration.

With the latest contract, the total number of A400M operators will now reach to ten countries.

The contract will take effect next year and includes a full maintenance and training support package.

The MoD and Airbus also signed a letter of intent (LoI) for the future procurement of four additional A400M jets.

Airbus Defence and Space CEO Michael Schoellhorn said: “This new order will further expand the A400M footprint in the Asia-Pacific region.

“The A400M offers outstanding capabilities to Indonesia, providing its airforce with the perfect platform to deliver large and heavy loads into remote areas and multiplying its airpower projection thanks to reliable aerial refuelling capabilities.”

“The A400M is a truly multi-role platform and will greatly enhance the Indonesian Air Force’s tactical air-to-air capabilities.

“This aircraft will play a key role in other key missions including paratrooping and heavy cargo transportation.”

The A400M can operate from rough and short runways. It is expected to enhance Indonesian Air Force’s airlift capabilities in responding to any crisis situations.

It can carry heavy and extra-large equipment across strategic distances and deliver the loads into tactical locations.

Republic of Indonesia Minister of Defence Prabowo Subianto said: “We are also looking at additional A400M acquisition in the near term, with future A400M developments such as firefighting an important capability we are exploring jointly with Airbus.

“The A400M will become a national asset and the cornerstone for human assistance and disaster response missions, beyond its tactical and air-to-air capabilities.”

According to Airbus, the A400M has already showcased its capability to refuel fighter jets and other major aircraft through its two underwing refuelling pods.

It can also refuel another A400M.

In September, Airbus received an order from the Republic of Kazakhstan for two A400M military transport jets."

While I had visited Greece earlier this summer, in this case we were just briefly returning for a wedding.

How I redeemed miles for Aegean Airlines business class

We needed to fly from Amsterdam to Athens, and fortunately Aegean Airlines had plenty of award availability on the following flight:

07/22 A3625 Amsterdam to Athens departing 12:05PM arriving 4:20PM

Aegean Airlines is part of the Star Alliance, so we were able to redeem Air Canada Aeroplan points (transferred from Amex Membership Rewards) for this reservation. The ticket cost 25,000 Aeroplan points plus $73 in taxes & fees per person. While not my best award redemption ever, it was convenient, and an economy ticket would have cost over $300 per person.

Aegean Airlines check-in & boarding

We arrived at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport at around 10:30AM, just over 90 minutes before departure. The airport was pretty busy, but we quickly found Aegean Airlines’ check-in desk. There was no queue in the business class and Star Alliance Gold line, so we were helped within a moment.

We were issued boarding passes for an 11:25AM boarding. Our flight was departing from gate B23, and we were also invited to use the Aspire Lounge, though we didn’t end up using it, but rather decided to head straight to the gate and get some work done on our laptops.

Amsterdam Schiphol Airport departure hall

Our Aegean Airlines A321 was already parked at the gate, and the gate area was extremely crowded.

Boarding ended up starting at 11:10AM — 15 minutes ahead of schedule — and was a mess. Group 1 and Group 4 were invited to board first. The biggest problem was that there was no way to actually get up to the gate. There were barriers along the side of the gate, so there was maybe an area a few feet wide where you could walk towards the gate agent, but basically everyone for the flight was lined up, even though they weren’t called to board yet.

I tend to think that boarding in the United States is a mess, but sometimes Europe takes it to a whole different level.

Aegean Airlines Airbus A321 business class cabin & seats

As is the standard on intra-Europe flights, business class simply consisted of economy seats with a blocked middle. On this particular flight there were three rows of business class, and then a red curtain separated that from the economy cabin.

On the plus side, there were some things that made this better than your typical intra-Europe business class product. While the seats were very thin, the legroom was much better than usual, and didn’t at all feel restrictive.

Furthermore, there was a center console where you could place drinks or other items during the flight. Nowadays many airlines have gotten rid of this feature, so I was happy to see this.

As usual, the tray table folded out from the seat in front.

The overhead consoles were modern, and had individual air nozzles, reading lights, and there were even television screens that popped down.

Unfortunately Aegean Airlines doesn’t have power ports or Wi-Fi on its Airbus A321s.

Our flight was packed — 10 of the 12 business class seats were occupied, and best I could tell, just about every economy class seat was full as well. I was grateful to have some extra room to stretch out, compared to economy.

Departing Amsterdam

At 11:55AM the main cabin door closed, at which point the safety video was screened. 15 minutes later we began our pushback. Parked next to us was a Sky Express Airbus A320 — it’s funny that they put the two Greek planes next to one another.

There was quite a bit of traffic at Schiphol Airport, so the plane spotting opportunities were good.

We ended up taxiing to runway 36L, which was quite a distance away. We were cleared for takeoff around 12:30PM, for our roughly 2hr50min flight to Athens. It was a beautiful afternoon in the Netherlands as we took off, and I enjoyed the views.

Aegean Airlines business class food & drink service

The seatbelt sign was turned off about 10 minutes after takeoff, and shortly thereafter the service began. Passengers were first offered sanitizing wipes.

Menus and drink lists were then distributed. I like how Aegean Airlines offers menus, since many airlines don’t offer that within Europe. The menu and drink list read as follows:

After menus were distributed, tray liners were brought out. While minor, this is also a nice touch that you don’t find on many airlines on similar routes.

We were then offered drinks, and I requested a Diet Coke, which was served in proper glassware.

The entire meal was served on one tray, and most of the dishes came covered, as many airlines do because of the pandemic.

All things considered Aegean Airlines serves quite hearty meals. All business class passengers were served an appetizer of quinoa salad with smoked chicken and rocket leaves, a cheese course with crackers, two rolls, and a Greek pudding with raisins and nuts.

Then there was the choice of two main courses. The first main course choice was chicken thigh in lemon sauce served with greek pasta. This is what I ordered, and I’ve gotta be honest, it didn’t taste great.

The other option was a veal fillet in tomato sauce served with potato mash. Ford ordered this and said it was okay, but not amazing.

Aegean Airlines has a pretty good coffee selection, including cappuccinos. I ordered a cappuccino, which was surprisingly decent, and served with two chocolates.

Later on in the flight, about an hour before landing, I ordered a glass of still water and a Greek coffee. The Greek coffee didn’t taste very good, as it was instant. Admittedly that’s totally on me, because it was advertised as such on the menu.

The bigger issue was that the center tray table that I placed the coffee on collapsed mid-flight, so the coffee spilled all over the place, including on my laptop and Ford’s pants and shoes. Oops. Aegean Airlines business class coffee & water

I’ve consistently had great service on Aegean Airlines, and have found flight attendants to be friendly and attentive, and this flight was no exception. The two flight attendants working business class were excellent, and constantly checked on passengers.

Greece can be a mixed bag when it comes to service, with some great and some not-so-great service, but I find that Aegean Airlines is pretty consistently good.

Aegean Airlines business class lavatory

There was a lavatory at the front of the cabin. While it was pretty no frills, it was clean and was exclusively reserved for business class passengers, so there wasn’t typically a line to use it.

Arriving in Athens

We ended up touching down in Athens at 4:20PM, and then had a five minute taxi to our remote stand. We parked next to an Aegean Airbus A320neo in the new livery. While not a particularly imaginative livery, I do think it’s an improvement over the old one, and I quite like it.

In this case arriving at a remote stand worked in our favor. Of course as an avgeek it’s fun to get such a cool view of a plane from the outside.

The other nice thing, though, was that there was a private bus for business class passengers, so we were on our way almost immediately. Not only was the bus spacious, but arriving at a remote stand meant we’d be dropped off right at baggage claim. We also got a pretty cool view of an Aeroflot 777 on our drive.

Getting out of the airport was quick, and within minutes we were on our way to our destination.

Bottom line

Aegean Airlines offers an above average intra-Europe business class product. Legroom is good, flight attendants are friendly, and the food is usually better than what you’ll find on most airlines (though in this case I personally didn’t love the food).

I do wish Aegean offered power ports and Wi-Fi. Aegean’s new A320neos at least have USB outlets, though that’s it.

If you’ve flown Aegean business class, what was your experience like?"

5 questions with Airbus Spain's FCAS lead - Defense News,"Fri, 05 Nov 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9kaWdpdGFsLXNob3ctZGFpbGllcy9mZWluZGVmLzIwMjEvMTEvMDUvNS1xdWVzdGlvbnMtd2l0aC1haXJidXMtc3BhaW5zLWZjYXMtbGVhZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"STUTTGART, Germany — In 2019, Spain signed onto the Franco-German Future Combat Air System program to develop a fighter jet, weapons and drones by 2040. Airbus is playing a lead role in the developing phase, and its Spanish subsidiary is the prime contractor for the stealth technology pillar as well as Madrid’s main industry partner on the next-gen fighter.

Defense News talked about the program with Miguel Angel Morin Martín, head of FCAS efforts at Airbus Spain.

This interview was edited for length and clarity.

What work are you performing on the FCAS program? What will take place by the end of Phase 1B?

Airbus is supporting the Spanish Defence Ministry in the system of systems operational definition as well as acting as prime of the Spanish industry in the development of the new-generation fighter demonstrator. Moreover, Airbus is the international leader of the enhanced low-observability technologies initiative. Finally, we are also supporting the other industries involved in the rest of the pillars thanks to unique know-how and expertise.

Phase 1B is focused on selecting the architecture of the demonstrators, validating technology road maps and starting the decision processes up to when the preliminary design review is achieved. In parallel, the overall demonstrator and development logic will be further elaborated.

How are you working with your colleagues at Airbus and the rest of the Spanish industry group to stay on schedule for this program?

Our process, standards and tools are available to ensure that the objectives on time, cost and quality are achieved. As an aerospace company with facilities in Spain, Airbus is already used to working with the rest of the Spanish industry, which is integrated in its supply chain.

What is the plan for the enhanced low-observability technologies pillar, which Airbus Spain mostly leads?

The ELOT pillar aims to provide a significant leap from the current state-of-the-art solutions by working on innovative and disruptive low-observability technologies with a holistic approach; that is, by considering all LO critical elements in the FCAS platforms and all different LO aspects impacting them (multispectrum approach including radar, infrared, visual and aural signatures). ELOT will pay attention to future threats by taking into account the evolution of sensors and effectors, and new scenarios in which those threats are coming from space.

Despite relevant efforts performed by FCAS nations on this field, there is limited experience in Europe regarding the integration of very low-observable, or VLO, tech in operational assets. Manufacturing techniques must be analyzed to cope with the complexity of managing those technologies within the production chain. In-service and logistics aspects must be introduced in the loop since we know the impact VLO can have on maintenance and fleet availability.

We started the identification of those key technologies, for which we intend to follow on with an engineering process. The level of ambition is high; our goal is to make the FCAS an ELOT reference among the sixth-generation air systems.

Which elements of the program benefit from extra stealthy features?

For the ground demonstrator for the new-generation fighter, we are actually looking into LO features. With regard to drones, we need to balance some key requirements related to cost and prioritizing the development of manned-unmanned teaming with the possibility to offer a low-observable performance.

What are some capability trade-offs when it comes to incorporating ELOT features into the program?

As we are still in the research and development phase, main topics under consideration are technological developments and its feasibility in relation to the development of operational needs. It is still early to comment or disclose further details on this topic.

Airbus Zephyr stratospheric drone demos internet connectivity during test flight - Aerospace Testing International,"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZXJvc3BhY2V0ZXN0aW5naW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC5jb20vbmV3cy9kcm9uZXMtYWlyLXRheGlzL2FpcmJ1cy16ZXBoeXItc3RyYXRvc3BoZXJpYy1kcm9uZS1kZW1vcy1pbnRlcm5ldC1jb25uZWN0aXZpdHktZHVyaW5nLXRlc3QtZmxpZ2h0Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus’ Zephyr S high altitude drone has provided wireless broadband connectivity during an 18-day stratospheric flight test.

The test program, which was conducted in partnership with Japanese mobile network provider NTT Docomo, took place in the USA during the summer.

The solar-powered Zephyr-S, which is known as High Altitude Platform Station (HAPS), has a 25m wingspan and weighs 75kg (165lbs). The aircraft has been in development at Airbus since 2013, but the program was originally started by UK-based defence company QinetiQ in 2003.

Airbus has mooted several possible applications for the Zephyr, initially in the defence sector to provide communications and surveillance but also in the commercial sector for disaster management and providing communications in unconnected regions.

During the stratospheric test flights, the Zephyr S carried a radio transmitter that provided a datalink at an altitude of approximately 20km (12 miles) to a receiving antenna on the ground.

The trial tested the stability of the connection between the Zephyr S HAPS and the ground antenna and how it was affected by factors such as weather conditions, differences in reception distance and the flight pattern of the HAPS aircraft. As a result, under three specific scenarios: clear, rainy and cloudy conditions, and in a multitude of flight patterns, data transmissions across various speeds were successfully demonstrated, up to a distance of 140km (87 miles).

Tests included various bandwidths to simulate direct-to-device service from the HAPS to end users using low, nominal and high throughput. The demonstration confirmed the viability of the 2GHz spectrum for HAPS-based services and also the use of a narrow (450MHz) band to provide connectivity in a range of up to 140km.

The measurement and analysis of the propagation of radio waves transmitted from Zephyr demonstrated the feasibility of stratospheric communications to devices such as smartphones. Airbus and NTT Docomo will now work to provide communication services to mountainous areas, remote islands, and maritime areas where radio waves are difficult to reach.

Takehiro Nakamura, general manager of Docomo’s 6G-IOWN Promotion Department said, “DOCOMO believes that HAPS will be a promising solution for coverage expansion in 5G evolution and 6G.

“In this measurement experiment, we were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of HAPS, especially for direct communication to smartphones, through long-term propagation measurements using actual HAPS equipment. Based on these results, we would like to further study the practical application of HAPS in 5G evolution and 6G with Airbus.”

The test data will be used to inform future LTE direct-to-device services that are expected to be provided via the Airbus Zephyr HAPS solution.

“Billions of people across the world suffer from poor or no connectivity. These tests show us the viability of the stratosphere to bridge this divide and provide direct to device connectivity via Zephyr without the need for base stations or extra infrastructure,”"

ALC signed a letter of intent to purchase 111 new Airbus aircraft, including seven of the new freighters, both companies announced in a statement Monday at the Dubai Air Show.

The multibillion dollar deal, which is expected to be final in the coming months, makes the Los Angeles-based ALC one of Airbus’ largest customers.

Founded in 2010, ALC has ordered 496 Airbus aircraft to date. The letter of intent also includes 25 A220-300 airliners, making ALC among the largest A220 customers in Airbus’s order book.

The ALC-Airbus deal also includes:

55 A321neos

20 A321XLRs

Four A330neos

“With this major order, we underscore our confidence not only in the strong future and growth of global commercial air transport, but in ALC’s business model, in our specific aircraft purchase decisions including, for the first time, the new A350 freighter, and finally in our long term view that ordering new aircraft is an optimum investment of our shareholder capital,” said John L. Plueger, ALC CEO and president, in a statement Monday.

Airbus said the A350F offers at least 20 percent lower fuel burn than the competition and is the only new generation freighter aircraft that will be ready for the 2027 International Civil Aviation Organization CO2 emissions standards.

Why This Matters

This order would position Airbus to gain a larger market share of the global freight market which Boeing has long dominated. In their World Air Cargo Forecast for 2020-39, Boeing predicts that the global freighter fleet could grow by more than 60 percent to more than 3,260 in the next two decades.

During the COVID pandemic, while passenger traffic plummeted, passenger carriers relied on air freight to bolster revenue. The current supply chain crisis has made additional air freight capacity particularly important.

“With foresight, ALC is solidifying its order portfolio for the most desirable aircraft types as we exit the crisis and in particular, it has seen the formidable value the A350F brings to the cargo market,” said Christian Scherer, Airbus chief commercial officer and head of Airbus International.

“ALC’s endorsement confirms the global enthusiasm we see for this quantum leap in the freighter space and we applaud its insightfulness in selecting it and in beating everyone to the finish line for the first A350F order announcement.”

Delivery is expected to begin in 2026."

One of the company’s A340 planes has successfully landed on the southernmost continent for the first time in history. Hi Fly, a boutique aviation outfit based in Portugal, spearheaded the flight, which took place on November 2.

More from Robb Report

Piloted by Captain Carlos Mirpuri, who also happens to be Hi Fly’s vice president, the widebody aircraft flew a total of 2,500 nautical miles from South Africa to Antarctica and back. Each flight took just over five hours, with Mirpuri and his crew spending less than three hours on the White Continent.

The cargo jet was chartered by Wolf’s Fang, a new luxury adventure camp helmed by the Antarctica tourism company White Desert, to bring much-needed supplies to the South Pole location. The ice runway at the Wolf’s Fang, which is almost a mile thick and 10,000 feet long, can be extremely difficult to navigate. In fact, special grooves have to be carved into the runway to give the plane a better grip while braking.

“The cooler it is the better,” Mipuri said in a statement.

Another hazard is the glare that bounces off the snow and ice. This not only makes the runway hard to distinguish, but it also makes it tough for your eyes to adjust between the outside view and the plane’s instrumentation. To combat this, the pilots don special eyewear.

“The blending of the runway with the surrounding terrain and the immense white desert around, makes height judgment challenging, to say the least,” the captain adds.

Despite the difficulties, Mipuri successfully got the jet’s wheels down. Following this landmark flight, the A340 will be used to fly a small number of tourists and scientists to Antarctica, along with essential cargo.

Story continues

It’s worth noting that there is still no actual airport in Antarctica. The icy abyss only has 50 landing strips and runways, which means there will likely be a few more challenging landings in the future. But Mipuri and his crew have proven that it can be done.
