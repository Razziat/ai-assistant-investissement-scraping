Airbus to launch a new A320 version: Cleared for take-off - The Economist,"Thu, 23 Sep 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vYmxvZ3MvbmV3c2Jvb2svMjAxMC8wOS9haXJidXNfbGF1bmNoX25ld19tb2RlbF9hMzIw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

AIRBUS is about to unveil a new version of its best-selling A320 aircraft. Along with its main rival, the Boeing 737, such single-aisle planes are the workhorses of worldwide aviation, accounting for four out of five commercial jets sold. But the Airbus A320 NEO will not be an all-new aircraft built from scratch; instead it will be an upgraded version of the classic A320, with a choice of two new, advanced engines which will offer big savings in fuel consumption.

Airbus bosses will meet on September 30th to put the finishing touches to the $1.3 billion project before putting it to the parent company, European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS). John Leahy, an Airbus executive, hopes to begin marketing the new plane as early as mid-October. Airbus's chief executive Tom Enders says his only remaining concern is to be reassured that his core team of 200-300 senior engineers can move on to the new single-aisle plane without disrupting other programmes, such as the A350 wide-body jet or the A400M military transporter—both of which have already suffered delays. That hurdle should be cleared at next week's meeting.

One of the new engines, Pratt & Whitney's geared turbo-fan, cuts fuel consumption by incorporating a gearbox that allows the air-intake fan to run at a different speed to the turbine that generates the thrust, unlike conventional jet engines. The other, an advanced version of the CFM56 engine made by a joint venture between America's General Electric and France's Safran, improves mileage by running at hotter temperatures than the current version.

Developing an all-new A320 would cost at least $10 billion. But Airbus does not believe the technology is currently available to make a big enough leap forward to justify spending that much. Mr Leahy points out that on smaller planes, unlike on large wide-bodies, it is difficult to achieve significant fuel economies through weight reduction, by using carbon-fibre composites instead of aluminium. Moreover, both Airbus and Boeing have found on their large-aircraft programmes that switching to carbon fibre is a lot harder than they had expected.

Mr Leahy thinks the new A320 NEO—which is likely to cost up to $8m more than the current model—will keep the product line going until 2025. He foresees sales of a further 4,000 planes, which is as many as it has delivered since the first A320s were launched in 1988. By 2025, he believes engine and composite fuselage technology should be ready for a dramatic improvement in weight and fuel economy. In the mean time, a touch of “frugal innovation” will keep the orders rolling in from cost-conscious airlines.

Airbus Changes Their Logo…Slightly - Airline Reporter,"Wed, 29 Sep 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMC8wOS9haXJidXMtY2hhbmdlcy10aGVpci1sb2dvLXNsaWdodGx5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has slightly updated their logo. It might take a true airline nerd to see the difference at first. Don’t worry, the iconic ball and the blue has stayed the same, however they updated the look of their font to be more modern.

Unfortunately, they didn’t have any large-sized version of the new logo when they announced it, but one Airbus employee (who I shall call Jon — since that is his name) sent me a nice koozie with the new Airbus logo.

So here you go. The new Airbus logo — I like it. I also like that French beer (yea, it is a little big, but it is the only French beer I could find). Time to celebrate the koozie! Cheers and thanks Jon!

Airbus Wants to Build Invisible Passenger Planes - Fox News,"Fri, 17 Sep 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3RyYXZlbC9haXJidXMtd2FudHMtdG8tYnVpbGQtaW52aXNpYmxlLXBhc3Nlbmdlci1wbGFuZXPSAVNodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3huZXdzLmNvbS90cmF2ZWwvYWlyYnVzLXdhbnRzLXRvLWJ1aWxkLWludmlzaWJsZS1wYXNzZW5nZXItcGxhbmVzLmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This is your captain speaking, your plane is about to become invisible!

Aircraft manufacturer Airbus has theorized a see-through passenger plane for the future, one with a completely transparent fuselage. In this concept craft, the push of a button by the captain would a send an electrical pulse through a high-tech ceramic skin -- making the main body of the plane see-through.

The extraordinary design would allow travelers to look down on cities and landscapes thousands of feet below or gaze up at the heavens, giving them the sensation of floating unassisted through the sky.

""Passengers in an airplane like this would experience flight in a completely new way,"" Airbus' head of research and technology, Axel Krein, the German news magazine Der Spiegel. Though the proposal might seem far-fetched, it is one of a number of plans being considered by engineers at the European aerospace giant.

Airbus unveiled the concept in ""The Future, By Airbus,"" written by the giant manufacturer for July's Farnsborough Air Show. The report includes information on potential future sources of energy (watch for the ""Cryoplane,"" fueled by hydrogen) and solutions for overcongestion in the air, such as pre-seating passengers in pods that are then loaded onto the plane when it is ready.

Other developments envisaged by Krein's team include an aircraft skin that can repair itself in the event of cracks or breaches and streamline engines that are embedded in the plane's fuselage rather than attached to its wings.

""We told our engineers to give their imaginations free rein. What emerged were completely realistic visions of flight in the year 2050,"" Krein told Der Spiegel.

But see-through air plane walls clearly take the cake.

""This smarter structure would help to make the aircraft lighter and more cost-efficient while giving the passenger 360 degree views of the skies,"" wrote the company. ""The planes of the future will offer an unparalleled, unobstructed view of the wonders of the five continents -- where you will be able see the pyramids or the Eiffel Tower through the transparent floor of the aircraft.""

Though wild, Krein insisted that the concepts aren't pie-in-the-sky guesses, but realistic hopes for the future of the industry.

""Our people are grounded in reality, after all. And most of the necessary technology already exists,"" he said.

Atkins wins major contract to supply Airbus with landing gear engineering services - Professional Engineering,"Thu, 09 Sep 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmltZWNoZS5vcmcvbmV3cy9uZXdzLWFydGljbGUvYXRraW5zLXdpbnMtbWFqb3ItY29udHJhY3QtdG8tc3VwcGx5LWFpcmJ1cy13aXRoLWxhbmRpbmctZ2Vhci1lbmdpbmVlcmluZy1zZXJ2aWNlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Engineering news

Engineering consultancy Atkins has won what it says is a “very significant” contract to supply engineering services for Airbus landing gear.

The contract, which will see Atkins working with independent landing gear specialist Stirling Dynamics, is for three years and will involve providing conceptual, analytical and design engineering services to Airbus’ UK-led Landing Gear Centre of Competence, which is based in Bristol.

Atkins’ aerospace division said that the deal would entail the creation of a number of new jobs – about 100 engineers are expected to work on the contract – and the development of the company’s existing aerospace engineering capability.

“This is genuine growth,” said Neil Kirk, managing director of the aerospace division. “We have to develop our in-house capability, and we will be training, developing and investing in people to fulfil the demands of the contract.

“This is about sustainable, high-tech engineering work.” Kirk added that landing gear was not an area that Atkins had traditionally been involved in, and that beating off competition to win the contract had been something of a coup for the company. He said he hoped successful fulfilment of the deal would lead to its extension in three years’ time.

The contract covers a wide range of existing aircraft, including the A380 and A320 families, where continuous development of landing gear to cut down costs and improve reliability is required. Atkins will also work on the landing gear for the newer A350 XWB aircraft, which is at an early stage of development. The company will also be involved in the research and development phase of engineering landing gear for aircraft at a conceptual stage.

The award of the contract for landing gear structures follows a deal to develop landing gear systems awarded by Airbus to Atkins Aerospace earlier this year."
Boeing takes on Airbus invisible planes with supersonic scramjet engines - Daily Mail,"Tue, 28 Sep 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90cmF2ZWwvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMzE1ODM2L0JvZWluZy10YWtlcy1BaXJidXMtaW52aXNpYmxlLXBsYW5lcy1zdXBlcnNvbmljLXNjcmFtamV0LWVuZ2luZXMuaHRtbNIBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90cmF2ZWwvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMzE1ODM2L2FtcC9Cb2VpbmctdGFrZXMtQWlyYnVzLWludmlzaWJsZS1wbGFuZXMtc3VwZXJzb25pYy1zY3JhbWpldC1lbmdpbmVzLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New York in 12 minutes is better than a see-through plane, says Boeing boss



When Airbus unveiled a dossier earlier this month that included such ambitious ideas as planes that could become invisible at the flick of a switch, the future of air travel suddenly sounded very exciting.

However, a boss at rival aircraft manufacturer Boeing has issued a realistic riposte saying that while disappearing fuselages may sound very impressive, your average traveller would be much more interested in the progression of supersonic travel, which could see tourists jetting to cities on the other side of the globe in less than an hour.



Blue skies thinking: The Concept Plane's streamline design would reduce fuel consumption significantly

'Invisible airplanes and see-through airplanes are all very interesting, but I'd rather get to New York in 12 minutes,' Mr Thomas told the Australia Israel Chamber of Commerce.

An international consortium that includes Boeing is currently looking at developing scramjet-based access-to-space systems, which enable supersonic travel.

Supersonic farewell: Concorde pictured on its final flight into Heathrow in 2003

However, it may be a while before Concorde-style travel times becomes the norm once more. Mr Thomas said that fuel efficiency was a more pressing requirement and that the company will focus on producing in bulk the 787 Dreamliner, which is slow but more economical with fuel.

The Dreamliner is the fastest-selling passenger plane in aviation history - the company has more than 840 orders from 56 airlines globally.

'The market really wanted something that was more fuel efficient and more economically viable,' Mr Thomas said.

The Airbus 'invisible plane' design would give passengers the sensation of floating in the sky and would allow them to look down on cities and landscapes below or gaze up at the heavens above.

The Airbus A380 touched down in Manchester on 1 September 2010

The arrival of the world's biggest commercial airliner in Manchester certainly grabbed the headlines. At the airport, hundreds of staff joined thousands of plane spotters to watch the twin deck aircraft touch down for the first time [1st Sept 2010]. But why is the A380 such a big deal for Manchester and the North West? Its supporters say the A380 has put Manchester Airport on the map and boosted the economy. Critics, however, have dubbed it ""a green monster."" Investment Capable of carrying up to 800 passengers, the development of the Airbus A380 is something of a revolution in the airline industry. A380 IN NUMBERS 2: number of showers on board 239: length in feet 800: passengers that can be carried 1,000: jobs secured by the A380 at Broughton £3,000: the price of a first class return to Dubai £7.5bn: the value of A380 work placed in the UK To accommodate such a big plane, Manchester Airport has spent more than £10m on new fire engines, a new aircraft stand and two bridges to connect the super jumbo to the terminal. It's a major investment that puts it an elite group of the world's top 17 airports big enough to take an airliner of this size. Which is why both the airport and Emirates were keen to celebrate the arrival of Manchester's first A380 complete with luxury features like on-board showers for its first class passengers. Maurice Flanagan, vice chairman of the Emirates Airline and Group said he was confident that bookings for the A380 would prove that it was money well spent. ''The A380 is proving to be a big hit with our customers,"" he said. ""Our advance bookings are already 20% up from the same period last year,'' he said. Services Emirates will be operating two daily services to Dubai from Manchester - one of them serviced by the new A380. For Manchester Airport, it's the culmination of nearly ten years' work. Airport fire engines welcomed the plane with a water spray It had to secure Civil Aviation Authority approval to take the super jumbo which has involved widening taxiways, re-aligning junctions and turns and moving dozens of runway signs so the giant plane can pass safely. The airport's managing director Andrew Cornish said it was a ""proud day"" for Manchester. ''A lot of hard work and planning has gone into the arrival from many people and we're pleased that we can now accept the newest type of aircraft flying today.'' Size So what's different about the A380 apart from its size? It's quieter for a start and more fuel efficient than many of its older rivals. But there are still concerns about its impact. Supporters say it's a greener aircraft and moving large numbers of people on one journey is a better way forward. It's a green monster not a green dream, it's as simple as that.

Jeff Gazzard, Manchester Airport Environment Network But critics have claimed the move towards this kind of super jumbo will ultimately have a negative environmental effect. Jeff Gazzard runs the Manchester Airport Environment Network. He disputed the aircraft's green credentials. ""The flight to and from Dubai will make 800 tonnes of CO2. Its fuel efficiency is actually 10.4 miles per gallon. ""That isn't fuel efficient: it's a green monster not a green dream, it's as simple as that."" Jobs Wings for the giant A380 are made at the Airbus factory at Broughton near Chester. They have to be shipped by special barge along the Dee for final assembly in France. Nigel Harvey, head of operations for the A380 at Broughton said its arrival was extremely important in terms of employment. ""It's created an awful lot of jobs within the local community,"" he said. ""It's secured jobs for about 1,000 people here within the factory."" Emirates is one of Airbus's best customers with twelve A380s in its fleet and a further 78 on order. 'Mark Barclay, Airbus senior vice-president, said it was also big business for the British economy. ""On the A380 programme, work valued at over £7.5 billion has already been placed in the UK,"" he said. ""Over the lifetime of the programme this is set to more than double.''

Those with a fear of flying look away now - aircraft manufacturer Airbus has revealed that passenger planes in 2050 could have a completely transparent fuselage.

It includes information about a 'Cryoplane', which would be fuelled by hydrogen, along with streamline engines that are embedded in the plane's fuselage rather than attached to its wings to reduce engine noise.



The streamline engines are shown in a computer-generated image of Airbus’ 'Concept Plane', which features a streamline design framed by curved wings that would reduce fuel consumption significantly.

Other ideas in the report include an aircraft skin that can repair itself in the event of cracks using microscopic nano-capsules containing a high-tech adhesive to seal the fissure.



The company claims nano-materials could also be used to enable seats to be 'self-cleaning'.



Krein told Der Spiegel: 'In the future each passenger will feel he or she is sitting on a brand new airplane about to take off on its maiden flight.'

The report also suggests that 'morphing' seats will be able to adjust to the shape of the passenger for a snug fit and that holographic projections could be used in the cabin to create virtual decors.



'We told our engineers to give their imaginations free rein. What emerged were completely realistic visions of flight in the year 2050,' Krein said.

Germany’s national airliner, Lufthansa, is flying the aircraft to Finland to test Helsinki airport's suitability as an alternate airport. The event also functions as a training flight.

The Lufthansa A380 will be parked on runway 2 at Helsinki airport for two hours, where it can be seen from various directions.

The superjumbo’s arrival is expected to draw a great deal of interest from aviation aficionados and plane spotters.

The aircraft is 73 metres in length, 21.4 metres in height and 7.14 metres in width. Its wingspan is nearly 80 metres.

Prior to its arrival in Helsinki, the plane stopped in at the airports in Copenhagen and Stockholm. From Finland, the plane will continue on to Oslo before returning to Frankfurt.

Airbus' invisible passenger plane plans unveiled - Daily Mail,"Mon, 20 Sep 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90cmF2ZWwvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMzEzNjQ1L0FpcmJ1cy1pbnZpc2libGUtcGFzc2VuZ2VyLXBsYW5lLXBsYW5zLXVudmVpbGVkLmh0bWzSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUtMTMxMzY0NS9hbXAvQWlyYnVzLWludmlzaWJsZS1wYXNzZW5nZXItcGxhbmUtcGxhbnMtdW52ZWlsZWQuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Is this the future of passenger planes? Airbus unveils plans for 'invisible' jets



It sounds more like promotional material for a new rollercoaster ride but aircraft manufacturer Airbus's ambitious new dossier on the planes of the future includes a passenger jet with a completely transparent fuselage.



The design would give passengers the sensation of floating in the sky and would allow them to look down on cities and landscapes below or gaze up at the heavens above.

Airbus engineers believe that a plane could be manufactured with a hi-tech ceramic skin, which the captain could send an electrical pulse through at the press of a button. The cabin roof, walls and floor would then become see-through, giving passengers a 360-degree view of their surroundings.



Airbus' head of research and technology, Axel Krein, told German publication Der Spiegel: 'The planes of the future will offer an unparalleled, unobstructed view of the wonders of the five continents - where you will be able see the pyramids or the Eiffel Tower through the transparent floor of the aircraft'.

The plans were revealed in the company’s report entitled 'The Future, By Airbus' in which engineers at the European aerospace giant were asked to imagine what flights could be like in 2050.



It includes information about a 'Cryoplane', which would be fuelled by hydrogen, along with streamline engines that are embedded in the plane's fuselage rather than attached to its wings to reduce engine noise.



The streamline engines are shown in a computer-generated image of Airbus’ 'Concept Plane', which features a streamline design framed by curved wings that would reduce fuel consumption significantly.

Other ideas in the report include an aircraft skin that can repair itself in the event of cracks using microscopic nano-capsules containing a high-tech adhesive to seal the fissure. The company claims nano-materials could also be used to enable seats to be 'self-cleaning'.



Krein told Der Spiegel: 'In the future each passenger will feel he or she is sitting on a brand new airplane about to take off on its maiden flight.'

Manchester Airport: A380 super-jumbo touches down - Daily Mail,"Thu, 02 Sep 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90cmF2ZWwvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMzA4MzMzL01hbmNoZXN0ZXItQWlycG9ydC1BMzgwLXN1cGVyLWp1bWJvLXRvdWNoZXMtZG93bi5odG1s0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL3RyYXZlbC9hcnRpY2xlLTEzMDgzMzMvYW1wL01hbmNoZXN0ZXItQWlycG9ydC1BMzgwLXN1cGVyLWp1bWJvLXRvdWNoZXMtZG93bi5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ian Godden, chairman of aerospace, defence and security trade organisation ADS, said: 'The UK aerospace sector is number one in Europe and second only to the US globally. The Airbus A380 is an embodiment of this success.' Plush... if you can afford it: While the Emirates A380 features 14 suites for First Class passengers, Business Class have to make do with these pods which fold flat to form a bed

Astonish luxury: Finished in burnished walnut, the pods feature a flat screen TV, mini bar, vanity mirror and bedside clock... but a Business Class flight from Manchester to Dubai will set you back...£2,571.76

Time to freshen up: The flight from Manchester to Dubai takes a little over seven hours, so First Class passengers might want to make use of one of the shower room on the upper deck (flying First Class to Dubai costs... £3,001.76)

One of the crowd of onlookers said: 'We’ve all been really impressed with it. I stood on one of the picnic tables to watch it come in.



'It looks really nice – it must be good when you can afford it.



'We had a false alarm when a Cathay Pacific plane touched down first – that was quite funny.



'It’s the kids’ last day before school and they have really enjoyed it. It’s been one of the best days in the last six weeks.'



Leigh-born Sir Maurice Flanagan, founding managing director of Emirates, said: 'It’s a proud day for me personally because I am from not far from here and professionally because it shows how far we have come.



'Manchester was the first European airport we flew out of and we used to carry 310 passengers a week. Now it’s 6,000.'

Airport managing director Andrew Cornish said the A380’s arrival was ‘a dream come true’.

Seats as far as the eye can see: Depending on the configuration the A380 can hold up to 853 passengers, but most airlines have opted to carry fewer passengers but providing them with more space and, hopefully, greater comfort

And an airport spokesman said: 'Everything has gone like clockwork. It was rather quiet when it took off again. But it will be back tomorrow and is now part of the airport forever.'



The huge, double-decker A380 went into passenger service with Singapore Airlines in October 2007, with Singapore starting Heathrow flights in March 2008.

It was originally known as the Airbus A3XX during much of its development phase, but the nickname Super-jumbo has since become associated with it.

The A380's upper deck extends along the entire length of the fuselage, and its width is equivalent to that of a widebody aircraft. This allows for an A380-800's cabin with 5,146 sq ft of floor space - 49 per cent more than the next-largest airliner, the Boeing 747-400.



It provides seating for 525 people in a typical three-class configuration or up to 853 people in all economy-class configurations."
