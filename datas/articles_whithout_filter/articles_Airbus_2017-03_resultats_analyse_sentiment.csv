"Airbus Pop.Up Concept Is a Flying, Driving Pod Car-Plane - WIRED","Fri, 10 Mar 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS8yMDE3LzAzL2FpcmJ1cy1zd2VhcnMtcG9kY2FyZHJvbmUtc2VyaW91cy1pZGVhLWRlZmluaXRlbHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air travel never involves air travel alone. City to city transport usually goes something like car or cab to train to shuttle to the terminal where you catch a plane, only to reverse the process at the other end, often with a little running somewhere along the line for good measure. Airbus came up with a crazy idea to change all of that with Pop.Up, a conceptual two-passenger pod that clips to a set of wheels, hangs under a quadcopter, links with others to create a train, and even zips through a hyperloop tube.

This crazy concept blurs the once-firm lines between planes, trains, and automobiles to let people take to the skies when traffic backs up. In other words, it's a flying car. A really cool flying car, cooked up with help from Italdesign and unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show, but still, a flying car. Farfetched, yes, but Airbus says it is taking the idea seriously. “Adding the third dimension to seamless multi-modal transportation networks will, without a doubt, improve the way we live, and how we get from A to B,” said Mathias Thomsen, general manager for urban air mobility at Airbus.

Around town, the carbon fiber pod couples with an electric ground module and rolls along on a rather conventional four wheels. It's autonomous, of course, because everything is in the future. Don't want to creep along in gridlocked traffic? Simply summon an eight-rotor air module that resembles a supersized consumer drone. Clip in, take off, and enjoy a range that, should this technology ever actually work, will max out at about 60 miles. Whatever mode to choose, the Pop.Up parks itself at a recharging station upon arrival.

It all sounds crazy, but some big names see it happening. Dubai, the most superlative of emirates, plans to put people-carrying drones in service later this year. Last year, Uber said it could launch a flying car service within a decade. Such things will help wealthy (and brave) commuters skip over traffic, but don't solve the last mile problem unless your destination boasts a rooftop landing pad. That’s where the Pop.Up idea enjoys an edge. It eliminates a key point of friction in multi-modal transportation: changing from one mode to the next. You just chill out in your pod.

Wanna hear the really crazy part? This scheme isn't as far-fetched as you might think.

“This is getting to be less of a technology challenge,” says Pat Anderson, who is developing similar vehicle concepts at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University. He believes autonomous software and electric propulsion will subject the aviation industry to radical changes. Say goodbye to wings on tubes, at least for short distances: batteries and rotors will win the day. That doesn’t mean there aren’t hurdles, not the least of which are federal regulations.

“We designed these regulations in the 50s and 60s, and they go largely unchanged, due to inertia,” Anderson says. The General Aviation Manufacturers Association is pushing hard to move certification of novel planes away from the current fixed federal standards, and into a less prescriptive model. That will mean new ideas can be approved more quickly, similar to the way that safety devices in cars are. The FAA has already gotten on board with the changes, for small aircraft, but designing and applying rules for an entirely new class of aircraft will take years.

As humans pack into increasingly dense global mega-cities, they'll need new ideas for transport to avoid gridlock. But Airbus and Italdesign haven’t committed to any sort of timeframe for this one, so (unless you live in Dubai) gazing up longingly through your car’s sunroof is as close to zooming through the sacré bleu sky as you’re likely to get, for now.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999023675918579}",neutral,0.9999023675918579,0
Italdesign and Airbus unveil Pop.Up - Airbus,"Mon, 06 Mar 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0wMy1pdGFsZGVzaWduLWFuZC1haXJidXMtdW52ZWlsLXBvcHVw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A traiblazing modular ground and air passenger concept vehicle system

● World-premiered in Geneva on March 7th 2017

● Aerospace and automotive industries unite to draw up a shared vision for seamless, multi-modal, fully electric urban mobility

● Urban transportation is moving into the third dimension, exploring city skies to contribute to relieving congested roads and reducing emissions

● The modular concept includes a capsule that connects to either a ground or air module, and can be integrated into other means of transportation

● An Artificial Intelligence platform will manage the trips offering passengers multiple optimized choices of transport combinations to match their travel preferences

● Passengers will interact with the multimodal transportation system through a simple app

● Passengers can relax and enjoy their journey thanks to a self-piloted system for both ground and air transportation

During the 87th Geneva International Motor Show, Italdesign and Airbus world-premiered Pop.Up, the first modular, fully electric, zero emission concept vehicle system designed to relieve traffic congestion in crowded megacities. Pop.Up envisages a modular system for multi-modal transportation that makes full use of both ground and airspace.

The feasible concept is the result of Italdesign and Airbus’ joint reflection on how to address the mobility challenges of megacities achievable for a majority, which has become one of the most pressing issues for commuters in megacities worldwide. With traffic congestion projected to hugely increase by 2030, the companies decided to combine their engineering expertise to tackle how to best achieve a sustainable, modular and multimodal urban mobility system - giving rise to the Pop.Up concept.

Pop.Up System consists of a three layers concept:

an Artificial Intelligence platform that, based on its user knowledge, manages the travel complexity offering alternative usage scenarios and assuring a seamless travel experience;

a vehicle shaped as a passenger capsule designed to be coupled with two different and independent electric propelled modules (the ground module and the air module). Other public means of transportation (e.g. trains or hyperloops) could also integrate the Pop.Up capsule;

an interface module that dialogues with users in a fully virtual environment.

The Pop.Up system aims to give time back to commuters through a flexible, shared and adaptable new way of moving within cities introducing a new user-focused transportation system concept. The Pop.Up vehicle combines the flexibility of a small two seater ground vehicle with the freedom and speed of a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) air vehicle, thus bridging the automotive and aerospace domains.

Pop.Up’s modus operandi is simple: passengers plan their journey and book their trip via an easy-to-use app. The system automatically suggests the best transport solution - according to user knowledge, timing, traffic congestion, costs, ridesharing demands - joining either the air or ground module or other means of transportation to the passenger capsule, and following passengers’ preferences and needs.

At the heart of the concept is a capsule: designed to accommodate passengers. This high-tech, monocoque carbon-fibre cocoon measures 2.6 metres long, 1.4 metres high, and 1.5 metres wide. The capsule transforms itself into a city car by simply coupling to the ground module, which features a carbon-fibre chassis and is battery powered.

For megacity journeys with high congested traffic, the capsule disconnects from the ground module and is carried by a 5 by 4.4 metre air module propelled by eight counter-rotating rotors. In this configuration, Pop.Up becomes a urban self-piloted air vehicle, taking advantage of the third dimension to get from A to B efficiently whilst avoiding traffic congestion on the ground.

Once passengers reach their destination, the air and ground modules with the capsule autonomously return to dedicated recharge stations to wait for their next customers.

Thanks to the possibility of combining the capsule also with other means of public transportation, the Pop.Up offers a seamless travel experience. The user can stay for the entire journey in the same capsule without worrying about switching between different travel modes and enjoy the entire commute time, with real time interaction between the capsule and the surrounding urban environment and communities.

Aerospace leader Airbus is harnessing its expertise to actively develop a number of radical concepts that will contribute to relieving urban congestion. “Adding the third dimension to seamless multi-modal transportation networks will without a doubt improve the way we live and how we get from A to B,” said Mathias Thomsen, General Manager for Urban Air Mobility at Airbus, on the occasion of the unveil. “Successfully designing and implementing solutions that will work both in the air and on the ground requires a joint reflection on the part of both aerospace and automotive sectors, alongside collaboration with local government bodies for infrastructure and regulatory frameworks. Italdesign, with its long track record of exceptional vehicle design was an exciting partner for Airbus for this unique concept project.”

“Italdesign is a service company, created to provide services and mobility solutions to interested parties worldwide. It is deeply rooted in our DNA to search for future state-of-the-art solutions,” said Italdesign CEO Jörg Astalosch. “Today, automobiles are part of a much wider eco-system: if you want to design the urban vehicle of the future, the traditional car cannot alone be the solution for megacities, you also have to think about sustainable and intelligent infrastructure, apps, integration, power systems, urban planning, social aspects, and so on. In the next years ground transportation will move to the next level and from being shared, connected and autonomous it will also go multimodal and moving into the third dimension” continued Astalosch. “We found in Airbus, the leader in aerospace, the perfect partner who shares this modern vision for the future of megacities to develop a sustainable multi-modal vision of megacity transportation,” he concluded.

"Airbus reveals a modular, self-piloting flying car concept - TechCrunch","Tue, 07 Mar 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAxNy8wMy8wNy9haXJidXMtcmV2ZWFscy1hLW1vZHVsYXItc2VsZi1waWxvdGluZy1mbHlpbmctY2FyLWNvbmNlcHQv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoY3J1bmNoLmNvbS8yMDE3LzAzLzA3L2FpcmJ1cy1yZXZlYWxzLWEtbW9kdWxhci1zZWxmLXBpbG90aW5nLWZseWluZy1jYXItY29uY2VwdC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has been talking about its Vahana flying autonomous vehicle project for a while now, but at this year’s Geneva Motor Show, it’s showing off a concept design created in partnership with Italdesign. The demonstration vehicle offers modular functionality, meaning it an operate both on the ground and in the air, and Airbus thinks it’s one potential answer to the growing problem of urban traffic congestion.

As you can see, it’s suitably sci-fi in its design sensibilities, but it’s designed with practicality in mind. The concept vehicle is intended to work with others to form a network that can be summoned on demand, with passengers hailing a ride form an app on their mobile device. The capsule-based design can connect to either ground or air conveyance modules, letting customers specific their preferred method of transit. It’s also designed to be used in concert with other, existing transportation methods for maximum efficiency.

Airbus and Italdesign call their creation the ‘Pop.Up System,’ which includes the artificial intelligence platform that uses what it knows about any individual user, and available routes and transit options to determine the best travel options. The main vehicle itself is a passenger capsule, which holds the rider and which can be paired with either ground and air modules, as well as, Airbus suggests, with hyperloop systems down the line once that tech becomes more widely available.

[gallery ids=""1461520,1461519""]

There’s a third part of Pop.Up that ensures this whole project touches all bases when it comes to current tech hype – an interface that will respond and interact with the user in a “fully virtual environment” while in transit. They’ve thought of everything.

Well, except making this thing real: It’s very much still a concept, though its 8.5-foot long monocoque carbon-fibre passenger pod is built-to scale and on the show floor at Geneva, as are the wheeled ground module and quadcopter drone air transit system.

It’s unlikely to ever be ferrying passengers around, at least in this state, and in the near future, but it’s a very cool design that can at least make us want to work a bit harder to get to a place where it is a viable, everyday option for navigating our expanding and increasingly dense cities.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999583959579468}",neutral,0.9999583959579468,0
"Airbus lifts employees' lives, transforms Alabama aerospace industry - Made In Alabama","Fri, 24 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hZGVpbmFsYWJhbWEuY29tLzIwMTcvMDMvYWlyYnVzLWxpZnRzLWVtcGxveWVlcy1saXZlcy10cmFuc2Zvcm1zLWFsYWJhbWEtaW5kdXN0cnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“Airbus’ Alabama manufacturing facility is producing more than planes — it’s also producing new opportunities that are enriching the lives of the company’s workforce, and benefiting their families and their communities,” said Governor Robert Bentley, who is scheduled to visit the factory next week.

By 2018, the Alabama manufacturing facility is expected to produce 40 to 50 A320 family aircraft per year, supporting around 1,000 jobs. The facility now has more than 360 employees.

“Airbus has had a transformational effect on Alabama’s aerospace industry, as evidenced by the new jobs and investment that are landing in Mobile and in surrounding communities at businesses supporting the assembly line,” said Greg Canfield, secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce.

“It’s also had a transformational effect on its workforce, which brings skill, dedication and the pursuit of excellence to their workplace every day.”

‘OPPORTUNITY TO SHINE’

“Seeing the first plane come together and take flight was a very proud moment for all of us.”

Workers say their time at the company has altered their lives in ways they never imagined.

“Airbus has given me the opportunity to shine more than I knew I could,” said Jennifer Milligan, a 31-year-old Mobile resident who is a structural mechanic and delegate inspector at Station 41 at the Airbus plant.

“With the support of my manager, HR team, and even my teammates I feel like the possibilities are limitless. I feel like I have the opportunity to do anything I want to with my career. My manager specifically makes that clear to me, and even encourages me to do so. I’ve never once felt like I was stuck or that I couldn’t move up. I honestly can’t express enough my gratitude for the support I have had.”

Likewise, Carlos Avellanet, 27, said Airbus has given him new opportunities through his job as a transport and logistics service manager.

“This job has meant a huge deal to me,” the Daphne resident said. “The global opportunities that Airbus offers are not rivaled. I never could have imagined living abroad for months, in China and Germany, and not only enjoying myself, but using the knowledge I gained about the cultures to help with day-to-day work. Now my mindset is to take on global projects for Airbus and work with all of the different cultures. It’s exciting.”

Bill Sisson, president and CEO of the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce, said the partnership with Airbus is already yielding significant benefits for the community.

“Airbus has without question provided great opportunity economically for the Mobile region,” he said. “Even more than that, the Alabama workers who have gone to work there are being given the opportunity of a lifetime to work for a global company in exciting and rewarding careers.”

BUILDING A CAREER

For Milligan, who grew up in Mobile, going to work for Airbus was a way to go back home.

“For a majority of the people here, it’s not just a job, we all care.”

She started her career in aviation through the AIDT training program at Mobile Aerospace Engineering and spent 3½ years there doing heavy maintenance repair. From there, she went to work at L3 Communications in Lexington, Kentucky, doing modifications on military helicopters, and then she was transferred to Fort Walton Beach, Florida, to do the ISO inspections on C-130s for the U.S. Air Force.

In all, she had nearly 10 years of heavy sheet metal experience prior to joining Airbus in October of 2014.

“I wanted to be back in my hometown,” Milligan said. “I also saw a huge opportunity with being able to start a project from the ground up. I wanted to be a part of Airbus coming to the U.S., especially to Mobile. I wasn’t just looking for a job. I was looking for a long-lasting career.”

And that career is already producing major accomplishments.

“Seeing the first plane come together and take flight was a very proud moment for all of us,” Milligan continued. “In the crowd you could hear random comments, ‘I built that’ or ‘We did it.’ We had a big celebration for it. It was an amazing feeling for sure.”

As for the future, Milligan said her career goals are a little open-ended right now.

“For starters, my main focus right now is getting Station 41 where it needs to be for the ramp up. Once things are moving smoothly, I do want to move up. I’m not exactly sure in which direction yet. I think I will have to wait and see where my experience takes me,” she said.

‘PART OF A TRANSFORMATION’

Meanwhile, Avellanet came to Airbus from L3 Communications in Crestview, Florida, where he started as a student intern in the summer of 2006. He continued to work there part time while he was in high school and was made a full-time employee in the property management department following his 2008 graduation.

He was later promoted to run the warehouse and continued in that role until leaving for Airbus.

Avellanet’s original interest in Airbus was sparked when the company was in the running for a refueling tanker contract with the Air Force, since his L3 background is government aircraft.

“When plans for the A320 manufacturing facility came up, I naturally was interested after all the researching I had done during the tanker proposal,” he said. “Working in aviation goes hand-in-hand with my favorite hobby: airplanes. Being involved in the day-to-day manufacturing is an exciting thing to me.”

“We have all grown together, and the team here is putting out a great product. ”

Avellanet’s career goals are to lead Airbus into the technology century and accept a mobility position to allow his skills to be used globally and absorb all the training possible.

“Being part of a transformation would be a huge deal for me. Airbus is such a large company with so many aspects, so we must embrace technology. Mobility would allow me to help other Airbus teams globally with items I am proficient in. Upon return, the knowledge transfer would benefit the whole team,” he said.

Working globally also allows him to expand his knowledge about how different cultures see some situations.

“I enjoy learning as much as possible,” he said. “There are so many great coworkers in Airbus with experience from all over the world. Listening will help expand my job skills.”

For Avellanet, seeing that first test flight brought back memories of his Airbus career up to that point.

“All of the traveling, training and rainy days in Hamburg were for this day. All of the people I had met talking about how much I would enjoy seeing it all come together and the pride I would feel were nothing but correct. This will be everyone’s favorite build on this site for a long time to come,” he said.

‘NOT JUST A JOB’

Milligan and Avellanet say it’s the people and culture that impress them most about the Airbus plant.

“For a majority of the people here, it’s not just a job, we all care,” Milligan said. “For example, at my station we are like a family. We look after each other and keep each other focused. This place is more than just another manufacturing facility, we all have so much invested in it that you would think we were all co-owners.”

Avellanet said he was first impressed by the brand new, state-of-the-art Mobile facility.

“This then evolved when I started meeting my coworkers and realizing what top-notch people we have,” he said. “We have all grown together, and the team here is putting out a great product.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9886646270751953}",neutral,0.9886646270751953,0

Li-Fi on board - Airbus,"Sun, 26 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE3LTAzLWxpLWZpLW9uLWJvYXJk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Our appetite for data is continuing to grow, which requires looking for alternatives beyond the traditional Wi-Fi technologies. Experts have a bright idea: why not access the internet through light bulbs? And not just at home, but also on a plane at an altitude of 10,000 metres.

The sound that reminds us of the early days of the internet goes something like this: first, there’s a dialling noise, followed by a long beep and then a scratchy chrrrzzzzz. It’s the dial-up sound of a 56 k modem (listen to it at savethesounds.info). In the ‘90s, this was the odd noise you heard every time you connected to the internet over the telephone line.

Those who experienced it at the time remember it well – although perhaps with mixed feelings. After all, while the internet modem opened the door to the World Wide Web – a novelty at the time – the web pages were painfully slow to load. If you wanted to download a music file, you were best advised to grab a good book to keep you occupied during the long wait.

Thankfully, this is a thing of the past. With Wi-Fi, today’s internet is 100 to 200 times faster than in the days of the 56 k modem. Experts around the world are working on 5G, the next generation of wireless broadband technology, to provide faster speeds, lower latency and better coverage than the current 4G technology.

It seems there will be no limits to the internet of tomorrow. However, according to Harald Haas, Professor of Mobile Communications at the University of Edinburgh, there’s a problem: “The radio waves currently used for transmitting data are limited, and we are beginning to run out of spectrum,” he says. The problem is compounded by our ever-growing and voracious appetite for data.

According to a prognosis made by Business Intelligence, the number of items connected to the internet will amount to 24 billion by 2020. Add to that the 10 billion smartphones, tablets, smartwatches and other gadgets, and a total of 34 billion devices will be connected to the World Wide Web by 2020 and able to communicate with each other.

Accessing the internet via light

As a suggested solution, the researcher presented his vision of accessing the internet via light, or Li-Fi, during a TED Talk in 2011. Using the technology, data is transmitted by changing the light intensity of LEDs at such a high rate that the flickering of the light is not visible to the human eye. A light sensor on the end device – for example a laptop – receives the data transmitted by the flashing and dimming light.



“The vision is that all we’d need to do is fit a small microchip to every illumination device to turn street lamps, office lights and bedside lamps into Li-Fi hotspots,” explains Haas. As there is a lot more visible light spectrum available than radio wave spectrum, it could be used to achieve higher data transmission speeds.

During experiments, scientists have already achieved speeds of 15 gigabits per second (Gbps) and have shown that future light bulbs can transmit 100 Gbps. At that rate, you could download 12 high-definition films in 60 seconds. Data transmission is even possible when the light is dimmed to levels hardly perceptible to the human eye.

Light Fidelity (Li-Fi) facilitates data connection in closed, controlled environments such as aircraft cabins. Li-Fi provides communication between electronic devices with the help of visible and invisible light, in particular via LED bulbs.

Integrating Li-Fi on board

According to Haas, all of these aspects make aircraft an ideal place to use Li-Fi. Each reading light in the cabin could easily be fitted with Li-Fi technology and turned into a hotspot, which would provide passengers with a sufficient volume of data to stream videos or immerse themselves in digital worlds.

So it’s no surprise that Haas’s vision has drawn a lot of attention – including at Airbus. “The first time I saw Professor Haas’s TED Talk, I just had to meet him,” explains Eric Peyrucain from Airbus’ Digital Transformation Office.

For this reason, Airbus has been in contact with Haas over the last few years paying special attention to the advances he has made. With his company pureLiFi, Haas has, for example, developed the world’s first Li-Fi dongle that connects to mobile devices. In 2011, the prototype he presented at a TED Talk was as large as a lectern. Today, it is the size of a business card, and within the next two years it is set to become small enough to fit into smartphones and tablets.

Airbus, however, has no intention of waiting until Li-Fi has entered the mass market. Developers are already working on solutions to integrate the technology on board.

Airbus is also working on solutions to give the cockpit Li-Fi access, explains Valentin Kretzschmar, aircraft data specialist at Airbus. The problem isn’t a new one: aircraft have an array of cables that add a great deal of dead weight. While Wi-Fi could solve this problem, it cannot be implemented without careful consideration.



Li-Fi, on the other hand, is safer, as it is not transmitted through walls like Wi-Fi and is therefore harder to tap from outside. This would, for example, make it much easier to prevent data streams in the cockpit from being hacked into from the cabin than if Wi-Fi were used.

""We don’t want data streams in our offices to be hacked from outside either, and Li-Fi provides a unique solution, since the signal isn’t transmitted through walls”, says Eric Peyrucain.



According to Peyrucain, the potential applications of Li-Fi at Airbus are not limited to aircraft. “We also see great potential for our manufacturing facilities.” Others have also seen the light: numerous companies and organisations such as the LiFi Research and Development Centre at the University of Edinburgh, the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft and NASA are driving the development of Li-Fi, a strong indicator that the Li-Fi vision will become reality. 20 years ago we accessed the internet at home with beeping modems. Now we are surfing silently, wirelessly, and soon, maybe, using light.

The Paris Air Show - Airbus,"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE3LTAzLXRoZS1wYXJpcy1haXItc2hvd9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Paris Air Show, held at Le Bourget airport, is the world’s oldest and largest aerospace exhibition. How did it all start?

Where aerospace gets down to business



Le Bourget airport has hosted the Paris air show since 1953. For a week in June, aviation’s kingmakers broker billion-dollar deals through the night. In daylight hours generals and presidents rub shoulders while aircraft of every stripe compete to pull the crowds.

Yet the airfield’s most famous hour came on a Saturday night in 1927, when Charles Lindbergh’s 33-hour solo Atlantic crossing ended there. Tens of thousands gathered to witness his arrival.

Lindbergh could never have predicted the unprecedented global response to his arrival in Paris. By that year, radio and telephones could transmit images and voices around the world. Motion pictures had just mastered the synchronisation of sound, allowing dramatic moments to be preserved in all their glory and distributed worldwide. For the first time all of civilisation could share as one the sights and sounds of an event. In this young aviator the new technology found its first superstar. A. Scott Berg in Lindbergh (1998)



From automobiles to aircraft

But two weeks before Lindbergh landed to be mobbed by ecstatic crowds, the legendary French biplane L’Oiseau Blanc (The White Bird) took off from the airfield on its own non-stop transatlantic attempt. With two First World War aces at the commands, it disappeared over the ocean and was never found.



Northwest of the city, Le Bourget started commercial operations in 1919 and was Paris’ only airport until Orly was completed in 1932.Today it serves business aviation and is home to France’s Air and Space Museum.

The Paris Air Show itself can trace its beginnings to 1908, when for the first time a section of the city’s motor exhibition was dedicated to ‘aerial locomotion’. The wonder of heavier-than-air flight, still in its infancy, was a huge draw and the public was in thrall to the heroes of the day: those magnificent men in their flying machines.

The Paris Air Show, the world’s oldest, first opened its doors in 1909. It has held at the Grand Palais in Paris.

From the Grand Palais to Le Bourget

The following year the first dedicated air show was held at the city‘s Grand Palais on the Champs Elysées, attracting 380 exhibitors and over 100,000 visitors. There were a further four editions before the outbreak of World War I.

The show restarted in 1919, to be held every two years before being interrupted again by the Second World War. It reconvened in 1946 – no mean feat given the near-total wartime destruction of France’s aeronautical industry – and since 1949 it has been held every odd year, with the Farnborough International Air Show occurring each even year in the UK.

Flying displays were initially held at Orly but in 1953 the show was relocated to Le Bourget for good. In 1969, Concorde and the Boeing 747 were exhibited in Paris for the first time. Gradually the show became a powerful rival to Farnborough.

Shows of strength

At the last Paris air show in 2015, Airbus Commercial Aircraft garnered 421 orders and commitments valued at $57 billion.

Today for that week in June Le Bourget becomes the world’s largest open-air showroom. Everyone competes to create ‘le Buzz’. Airlines queue up to present their newest aircraft and latest cabin innovations.

Lessors move from chalet to chalet to announce leasing deals and aircraft purchases. Small businesses have a global stage on which to showcase their expertise. Manufacturers occupy plenty of floor space too, inhabiting multi-storey pavilions that house everything from scale models and cabin mock-ups to fully-equipped flight simulators.

Airbus has of course been a regular exhibitor at Le Bourget, where the company has sealed some of the largest orders ever made in civil aviation. The company first saw the light of day at the air show.

On 29 May 1969 French transport minister Jean Chamant sat down with German economics minister Karl Schiller in a mock-up of the cabin of a new aircraft destined to reshape the aviation industry. The two politicians signed an agreement officially launching the A300, the world’s first twin-engine wide body.

The aircraft was to be built by a French-German consortium which would also involve the British and the Dutch. The decision to give the A300 the go-ahead was the formal starting point of the Airbus project.

Taking centre stage

Airbus’ civilian and military aircraft regularly perform star turns at Le Bourget, their swooping flight displays a firm favourite with the enthusiasts who flood the showground when it finally opens to the public after four frantic days of deal-closing.

A proving ground for the most cutting-edge innovations from around the world, the show has also been a launch pad for many Airbus products. The A380 made its debut there in 2005 and its flight displays broke all previous records for public attendance at the show – some 230,000 visitors over three days came to admire the aircraft. The A380 has been a firm favourite ever since, its flight display keenly awaited as one of the week’s highlights.

The record set in 2013 for the number of exhibitors at the Paris air show was broken during its 51st edition in 2015, with 2,303 exhibitors from 48 countries present that year. From a business point of view, the 2015 show was exceptional for many aircraft manufacturers, with $150 billion of orders announced. Around 201,000 general public visitors attended.

In 2011 Airbus Helicopters unveiled its X3 experimental high-speed compound helicopter at Le Bourget. Then in 2013 at the 50th Paris air show the youngest member of the Airbus family, the A350 XWB, performed a flypast just days after its maiden flight. Airbus revealed a demonstrator of its highly-anticipated E-Fan all-electric pilot training two-seater during that edition too.

The real item performed at the 2015 show, 12 months after its first flight and just weeks before its historic crossing of the Channel. True to Airbus tradition, the E-Fan had stepped into the shoes of the pioneers who put Le Bourget on the map long before anyone had ever put pen to paper to sign a megadeal.

The use of “smart glasses” in an innovative application of 3D technology developed in a teaming of Airbus and Accenture has enabled greater efficiency and time savings during the outfitting of Airbus aircraft, and is being extended to flight test equipment installation on A330neo (New Engine Option) jetliners.Airbus previously utilized the smart glasses on series-production A330s, performing position-marking for the installation of seat legs in cabins of 60 A330ceo (Current Engine Option) jetliners on the Toulouse, France final assembly line.The success led to the deployment of smart glasses technology in mounting flight test equipment last year on the no. 2 A330neo; an experience to be repeated this November aboard the no. 3 A330neo aircraft.“Before the arrival of smart glasses for in-cabin applications, we had to decipher complex drawings and convert imperial measurements into metric measurements in marking the position of the equipment on the cabin floor,” said Cédric Gardon, the Industrialisation Technical Manager for Flight Test Installation. “We were surprised at how much time we saved. The operation used to require three people and three days; now it requires one single operator and six hours.”With the use of smart glasses now well established, Airbus is looking at broader cabin outfitting opportunities in A330 final assembly line applications, eventually expanding the process to other aircraft programmes as well.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9983155727386475}",positive,0.9983155727386475,1

To prepare next generation of pilots and maintenance engineers

Airbus has broken ground for its first fully-owned training centre in Asia, located at Aerocity, New Delhi – which will support India’s growing need for Airbus aircraft pilots and maintenance engineers

Airbus is setting up a greenfield training facility at Aerocity, New Delhi, to support India’s growing need for Airbus aircraft pilots and maintenance engineers. The ground-breaking for the Airbus India Training Centre was performed by P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju, Hon’ble Union Minister of Civil Aviation and Tom Enders, CEO, Airbus in the presence of Jayant Sinha, Hon’ble Minister of State for Civil Aviation.India is the fastest growing domestic aviation market in the world and is expected to continue to grow at an annualised 9.3% over the next 20 years, outpacing the world average of 4.6%. The number of trips per capita in India is expected to quadruple by 2035 due to a combination of economic and demographic factors.To cater to this huge demand, Airbus forecasts a requirement for at least 1,600 new passenger and freighter aircraft by 2035. The consequent increase in Indian in-service aircraft fleet will lead to an accompanying need for over 24,000 new pilots and maintenance engineers.“India’s rapidly growing passenger aircraft fleet must be matched by adequate availability of skilled pilots and maintenance engineers. Airbus’ pilot and maintenance engineering training center is the type of facility which will help augment the talent pool of such personnel and thus be a force multiplier for the Indian aviation sector, said Shri P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju, Hon’ble Union Minister of Civil Aviation.“We have only scratched the surface when it comes to the growth of civil aviation in India. This training centre will be the first such facility fully owned by us in Asia. It is a symbol of our enduring partnership with this country,” said Tom Enders, CEO, Airbus.The almost 7000 m2 Airbus India Training Centre will be built in a modular concept in order to become operational by end-2018 with two A320 full flight simulators, increasing to four and potentially to six simulators in due course. It will start with an initial capacity to train over 800 pilots and 200 maintenance engineers annually.The centre will cater primarily to Airbus operators in India and the region. Airbus has more than 250 aircraft in service in India and over 570 are on order by Indian airlines.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9711927175521851}",neutral,0.9711927175521851,0

Airbus invites young girls to set their sights on a career in the aeronautical industry - Airbus,"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0wMy1haXJidXMtaW52aXRlcy15b3VuZy1naXJscy10by1zZXQtdGhlaXItc2lnaHRzLW9uLWEtY2FyZWVyLWluLXRoZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 23 March 2017. Airbus launches three events to allow young girls to discover the professions open to them in the aeronautical industry, favouring the diversification of career paths, raising awareness of young people on the impact of stereotypes on their choice of career and promoting a greater gender mix and diversity in the workplace. For Airbus, diversity, in all its shapes and forms, is necessary and essential to strengthen its innovation, performance and commitment.

Even if the young women pursuing technical and scientific studies or reading an engineering degree at university represent just 15 to 20% of students, Airbus has nonetheless set itself the goal of having more than 30% women among the people it hires. To achieve this, it is essential to intervene at a very early stage, right from the first phases of career guidance, in the third and fourth years of secondary school, or later in sixth form.

Three major events for encouraging greater diversity<br /> <br /> Elles du futur

Three major events for encouraging greater diversity and the feminisation of the historically masculine, aeronautical industry careers:

On 24 March Airbus is organising “Elles du Futur” (Women of the Future) in partnership with the local Education Authority in Toulouse. Some 80 third-year secondary school girls from priority education schemes and rural areas will be welcomed at Airbus for the day, to visit the production sites and, above all, to talk with female employees working as technicians and engineers at Airbus.

Additionally, on 31 March Airbus will be taking part in “Féminisons les métiers de l’aéronautique” (Let’s feminise aeronautical industry careers in partnership with the Airemploi association. Where some 20 secondary school girls will be invited for a day where female Airbus sponsors will present their work in small groups, talk about their careers, their past experience and potential professions.

The goal for Airbus is to promote aeronautical industry careers with female secondary school students and thus favouring the diversification of career orientations. This will also provide an opportunity to encourage professional callings, show that aeronautical professions are open to them and represent career opportunities that they can consider.

Alexia, aged 16, is today a fifth-year student at Lycée Airbus studying for a Professional Baccalaureate (A’ Levels) in Electrics and took part in the 2015 edition of “Elles du Futur”. She then chose aeronautical studies as her speciality. “I wasn’t familiar with the aeronautical sector, or with the professions it offers until I took part in “Elles du Futur”. I didn’t want to do academic studies, where the focus is too theoretical for me... Since the beginning of the school year I have discovered aircraft production. It’s really what I was looking for, our workshops are just like what we’ll be doing later on in industry.... In my year, there are 12 girls and 90 boys. It came as a bit of a shock to begin with because at secondary school it’s not like that, but we got on well with the boys right from the start… We need more initiatives like this for girls,” she adds.

Marine, aged 17, is in her final year at Lycée Stéphane Hessel in Toulouse studying for a diploma in Engineering Sciences, and she wants to embark on a scientific and technical higher education course next year. I chose scientific studies for my Baccalaureate because I was looking for something tangible. After secondary school, I came to the Open Day at Airbus where I met people who helped me to choose my current course of study. I don’t have a precise idea of the career path I’d like to take later, but I would like to do a two-year engineering course in physics, chemistry and engineering sciences. I can’t see myself doing anything else,” she explains.

A third initiative will also be proposed by Airbus: a mobile photo exhibition on the theme of diversity. #ENSEMBLE (#TOGETHER) is an interactive exhibition based on employee testimonials, combining photos and augmented reality. It proposes an enjoyable initiation, introducing young people to the issues of diversity. The exhibition will be visiting some 30 establishments, secondary schools, sixth forms, engineering colleges and universities all round France. It will begin at ISAE-SUPAERO on the 3 April.

Embracing diversity goes well beyond a societal and moral commitment for Airbus. It is the very basis of its identity. Airbus counts more than 135 nationalities and more than 20 different languages. And it’s thanks to an inclusive culture, founded on the viewpoints of a wide range of profiles that Airbus will achieve and go beyond its ambition to connect the world. It is therefore #ENSEMBLE that we will obtain the best results.

Is Airbus Passenger Drone Concept the Solution to Urban Mobility Problems? - DroneLife,"Fri, 10 Mar 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vZHJvbmVsaWZlLmNvbS8yMDE3LzAzLzEwL2FpcmJ1cy1wYXNzZW5nZXItZHJvbmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Every cool piece of drone tech was nothing more than a concept at one stage. That’s why we still get a little bit excited when futuristic new blueprints are unveiled that could be genuinely transformative. Even more so when the company behind the concept happens to be one of the world’s largest aviation specialists. This week, Airbus revealed a passenger drone project it’s been working on with Italdesign. Take a look at this – it’s called Pop.Up.

Impressive, right? Pop.Up is a modular solution for the near future, for when urban areas are even more crowded and getting into work requires nothing less than a combination of road and air transport.

The idea is that the pod can separate from both the wheels and the drone, with the props being part of an on-demand service for whenever you need them – sort of like an aerial Uber.

But it’s not just the hardware that Airbus and Italdesign have put forward in this transport proposal. For Pop.Up to ever become a reality, there would need to be a total infrastructure overhaul, from docking bases in high-rise buildings to an air traffic control system to guide these autonomous drones safely through the skies.

These aren’t problems that are new to companies developing flying passenger drones, or even the commercial drone industry in general. Indeed, many of the same infrastructure issues can be compared with those related to drone delivery systems.

Mathias Thomsen, general manager for Urban Air Mobility at Airbus, speaking at the unveiling at a motor show in Geneva, said: “Successfully designing and implementing solutions that will work both in the air and on the ground requires a joint reflection on the part of both aerospace and automotive sectors, alongside collaboration with local government bodies for infrastructure and regulatory frameworks.”

“Adding the third dimension to seamless multi-modal transportation networks will without a doubt improve the way we live and how we get from A to B.”

Italdesign CEO Jörg Astalosch, said: “Today, automobiles are part of a much wider ecosystem: if you want to design the urban vehicle of the future, the traditional car cannot alone be the solution for megacities, you also have to think about sustainable and intelligent infrastructure, apps, integration, power systems, urban planning, social aspects, and so on.”

“In the next years ground transportation will move to the next level and from being shared, connected and autonomous it will also go multimodal and moving into the third dimension”.

The “third dimension” Astalosch and Thomsen describe is the key here. Whether regulatory bodies, safety concerns and public opinion will allow for ambitious projects such as this to become a reality remains to be seen.

Companies in the drone industry, most notably EHANG, have been working on similar solutions. EHANG’s 184 has even been involved in successful testing in Dubai. It’s likely that this trend will continue, and that countries with less strict drone regulations will be where pioneers choose to develop their concepts.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9994210004806519}",neutral,0.9994210004806519,0

Airbus and Italdesign want to try something different. They've just unveiled the Pop.Up, an autonomous concept that uses a modular passenger capsule to switch between four-wheeled ground transport and quadcopter flight. All you do is tell the vehicle's AI where to go -- it'll snap on air or ground modules based on both the available routes and your habits. Airbus even floats the possibility of shuttling your capsule through hyperloop tubes when they're available.

This wouldn't sit in your driveway. Airbus foresees Pop.Up vehicles forming an on-demand transportation network that isn't hampered by the limitations of ground-based options. It could dramatically reduce traffic congestion, too. Why drive on a packed bridge when you can simply fly over the river?

The gotcha, as you might guess, is that this is just a concept. There are life-size examples of Pop.Up at the Geneva Motor Show, but there's a big difference between that and showing off a working prototype, let alone something ready to handle your commute. If Airbus is committed to making this a real product, any practical use is going to be years away.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999600350856781}",neutral,0.999600350856781,0

New Airbus-Japan venture aims for new aircraft - Leeham News and Analysis,"Tue, 14 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNy8wMy8xNC9uZXctYWlyYnVzLWphcGFuLXZlbnR1cmUtYWltcy1uZXctYWlyY3JhZnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"March 14, 2017, © Leeham Co.: A new partnership, still in the Memorandum of Cooperation stage, between France and Japan aims to expand a relationship that could lead to joint development of advanced aircraft for Airbus.

The MOC was signed between the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry of Japan (METI) and the Directorate General for Civil Aviation of the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy (MEDDE) of the French Republic.

“An Airbus-Japan Ad Hoc Civil Aeronautical Industry Working Group will be established, and it will meet on a regular basis to discuss technology fields that could be considered for cooperation between Airbus and Japan such as material, aircraft system and equipment, or manufacturing technologies for the development of future Airbus aircraft,” Airbus said in a March 1 press statement announcing the MOC.

Airbus sales historically trailed Boeing badly in Japan, although the current backlog leans slightly in the European OEM’s favor: 87 to 74.

Boeing-Japan cooperation

Cooperation between Boeing and Japan’s industry goes back decades. It was deepened with the development of the 787, in which Japan’s “heavy” industries (Mitsubishi, Kawasaki and Fuji) have roles in the design, development and production of Boeing airplanes that were unprecedented.

It was also a rocky relationship, as design and production issues upended the industrial partnerships and led to delays Boeing had never seen before.

This is history now. The 787 is proceeding smoothly. Despite difficulties with the Mitsubishi-produced wing, Boeing and this “heavy” entered into a support and services agreement for Japan’s first home-grown commercial airliner since the NAMC YS-11 turboprop 50 years ago, the Mitsubishi MRJ jet.

Close international ties

Historically close relations between the US and the Japanese government had trickle-down benefit to Boeing sales.

“It was a closed market,” said John Leahy, Airbus COO-Customers in an interview on the sidelines of the ISTAT annual conference in San Diego last week. “It was one of our goals for 20 years” to increase Airbus’ market penetration and match, or exceed Boeing’s backlog.

“In the past, there was a lot of [US-Japan] government-to-government sales there,” Leahy said. “When a carrier like JAL was state-owned, it was hard for us to even get in there to see the airline. As the airlines had to stand on their own two feet,” things changed.

The advent of low-cost carriers also prompted a market share shift.

“We have 95% of the LCC market,” Leahy said. Winning an A350 order from JAL was “very important.” Leahy also finally put the giant A380 into Japan’s top carriers, winning an order for three from ANA—albeit through the back door via bankrupt A380 customer Skymark and ANA’s role in the Skymark reorganization.

Airbus-Japan cooperation

Leahy said the MOC with Japan is an extension of Airbus engineering and design centers located globally.

“We want to get the best and brightest going forward,” he said. “This is about advanced design, not industrialization.”

An Airbus spokesman in Japan, in an email interview with LNC, said, “We are interested in broad area and don’t specify the particular area at the moment. Overall, our interests are in technology fields, such as material, aircraft system and equipment, or manufacturing technologies for the development of future Airbus aircraft.

“We see Japan as key location for partnerships in areas such as R&T and digital innovation for our future aircraft,” the spokesman said. “We welcome Japan’s cutting-edge aerospace technologies on board Airbus aircraft and aim to expand industrial partnerships with Japan. We are seeking for developing non-conventional fuel, more electrical systems, or new configuration of aircraft that would have less impact to the environment.

“We are looking at game-changing technologies that are required for future generation of aircraft, not only from Japan’s aerospace companies, but also from non-aerospace companies,” the spokesman said.

Mitsubishi and Fuji are already suppliers to Airbus, the spokesman said. There are currently about 20 suppliers in Japan.

First air-sea rescue helicopters were delivered in 1984 .Aircraft expected to remain in service another two decades with planned upgrades

DALLAS, Texas – Airbus Helicopters Inc. saluted the U.S. Coast Guard on Wednesday for its recent milestone achievement of reaching 1.5 million flight hours with the service’s fleet of MH-65 Dolphin patrol and search-and-rescue helicopters.From patrolling the skies over Lake Michigan to performing life-saving rescues in the Gulf of Mexico, the Coast Guard’s MH-65 Dolphin has become the most recognizable search and rescue aircraft in the world.“This is an enormous accomplishment for the U.S. Coast Guard, and for Airbus,” said Chris Emerson, President of Airbus Helicopters Inc. “We are proud of the great work the men and women of the Coast Guard perform with these aircraft. They have saved countless lives and guarded our nation’s borders and ports. We look forward to working with the Coast Guard for years to come, supporting their missions by keeping this workhorse helicopter flying and serving the American people.”The Coast Guard selected the Dolphin, based on the Airbus AS365 Dauphin product family, in 1979 as its new short-range recovery air-sea rescue helicopter replacing the HH-52A Sea Guard. The aircraft is certified for operation in all-weather and night operations, except icing conditions.Airbus delivered the first Dolphin in 1984. The fleet of 100 helicopters has played a critical role for the Coast Guard, from performing lifesaving missions after Hurricane Katrina and other natural disasters to executing successful rescues at sea and in high-altitude mountainous terrain.In addition to serving at Coast Guard Air Stations throughout the United States and Puerto Rico, the MH-65 is the primary aircraft used aboard sea-going cutters during deployments. The Coast Guard’s Helicopter Interdiction Tactical Squadron in Florida also uses the helicopters for counter-narcotics missions in high-threat drug trafficking areas.The MH-65 fleet is expected to remain in service through 2035. New engines were installed on the Dolphin fleet in 2007, which significantly enhanced the aircraft’s power and mission capabilities. The Coast Guard is expected to introduce the next configuration of the Dolphin, which will include an all-glass cockpit and advanced navigation capabilities, in 2018.Industry-leading Airbus helicopter models are on display at Heli-Expo 2017 Booth 7648.

"Airbus Has a Concept for a Transforming, Flying Car - Popular Mechanics","Tue, 07 Mar 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHVsYXJtZWNoYW5pY3MuY29tL2NhcnMvY2FyLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kvYTI1NTgwL2FpcmJ1cy1wb3AtdXAtZmx5aW5nLWNhci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"We're still waiting for the flying car, and it looks like we might still be waiting for a very long while. But in the meantime, Airbus has revealed a concept vehicle which is part self-driving car, part flying machine called a Pop.Up. It's like something out of a sci-fi movie, which is fitting considering the chances that it will ever actually exist.

The Pop.Up, unveiled during the 87th Geneva International Motor Show, is what Airbus bills as ""the first modular, fully electric, zero emission concept vehicle system designed to relieve traffic congestion in crowded megacities.""

The concept has a few parts. First, there's an AI platform that would survey routes and make decisions the best way to get from Point A to Point B. Then there's the car itself: ""[a passenger capsule] designed to be coupled with two different and independent electric propelled modules (the ground module and the air module),"" Airbus says in a press release. The company also leaves the door open to transporting the capsules by hyperloop-like means, should the opportunity ever present itself.

Airbus The Pop.Up, preparing for takeoff.

Last year, Airbus unveiled the design of the Vahana, and as of February, the Vahana Medium page is still updating. So even though we haven't seen any real progress, it's fair to say that Airbus hasn't given up on it quite yet.

The Vahana, which only flies, might be seen as a precursor to this new experiment. Airbus hopes to get the former up in the air by 2020, and to make something like the Pop.Up a physical reality in seven to ten years, though when it comes to flying cars, you need to take those estimates with a bolder-sized grain of salt.

Hong Kong Government Flying Service to receive first Airbus H175 by year-end - Vertical Magazine,"Fri, 03 Mar 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvaG9uZy1rb25nLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtZmx5aW5nLXNlcnZpY2UtcmVjZWl2ZS1maXJzdC1haXJidXMtaDE3NS15ZWFyLWVuZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Development of the Airbus Helicopters H175’s public services version is well underway and the first three shipments, to Hong Kong’s Government Flying Service, are scheduled for the end of the year. Meanwhile, the medium twin’s main market, offshore oil-and-gas, is still down and only 12 H175s are in service. Launch customer NHV received the first aircraft in December 2014.

For the new variant, missions may include search-and-rescue, emergency medical services, and law enforcement. Among other additions, it includes a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) system, a hoist and a searchlight. It is designed to be operated by a typical crew of four, and the cockpit is fully compatible with using night-vision goggles. A central display supports a digital map supplied by EuroAvionics, six external cameras (including the FLIR) and radar image.

As of late February, Airbus test pilots and engineers had logged “between 50 and 60” flight hours on the new version. Hong Kong’s Government Flying Service has ordered a total seven H175s to replace its fleet of EC155 Dauphins and AS332 L2 Super Pumas.

Airbus Helicopters received orders for eight H175s last year. Ten examples of the 16- to 18-seater were produced in 2016, but only eight deliveries took place, the other two having been postponed to 2017. Between 12 and 14 handovers are scheduled for this year, slightly down from expectations expressed five months ago.

Offshore operator NHV last month announced its eight H175s had logged a combined 10,000 flight hours, corresponding to 4,750 flights. The longest distance NHV has flown non-stop with passengers and cargo is 180 nautical miles.

Airbus engineers keep improving their product, notably by solving maturity issues. The locking device on the right cargo door, for example, was recently modified. Last December, the H175 was certified with an maximum takeoff weight increase to 7.8 metric tons (17,180 pounds). This translates into a 300 kilogram (660 pounds) of payload enhancement or an additional 40 nautical miles in range.

The first flight with a Pall filter using vortex generators took place last year. Integration is ongoing. The new generation of such inertial particle separators is more aerodynamically efficient and they cause less installation losses, the airframer says.

The equipment for flight into limited icing conditions was certified last November. A full icing protection system, which will include rotor blade deicing, is on the backburner.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999887943267822}",neutral,0.9999887943267822,0

In January, the firm revealed its prototype flying vehicle, under the banner of Project Vahana, would be tested this year. Now, it has released an even more ambitious concept at the Geneva Motor Show: a hybrid-car and drone called Pop.Up

The 'modular vehicle' comprises of a car that, essentially, can disconnect from its wheels and can be picked-up by a flying set of rotors. Airbus, which designed the concept with Italdesign, says the vehicle is ""shaped as a passenger capsule"" that can be used as a ground or air module.

""The Pop.Up system aims to give time back to commuters through a flexible, shared and adaptable new way of moving within cities introducing a new user-focused transportation system concept,"" the company says.

""The Pop.Up combines the flexibility of a small two-seater ground vehicle with the freedom and speed of a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) air vehicle, thus bridging the automotive and aerospace domains.""

Airbus says the bizarre system was created to allow those using it to decide how they want to travel. If the roads are busy, a passenger can take to the sky. When in the air, it is envisioned the vehicle will operate autonomously.

The capsule, also described as a 'cocoon', would be created from carbon-fibre and measure 2.6 metres in length, 1.4m high and 1.5m wide. When it is uncoupled from the ground module, it can be picked-up by five 4.4m air propelled counter-rotating rotors.

At present, as with many concepts, Airbus doesn't have plans to create the vehicle but says the idea is intended to tackle rising amounts of traffic on the roads.

However, Airbus is already working on a flying car.

CEO Tom Enders expects the company's single-person transportation vehicle to be airborne - although in limited tests. ""We are in an experimentation phase, we take this development very seriously,"" Enders said at the DLD digital tech conference in Munich in January, according to Reuters.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999834299087524}",neutral,0.9999834299087524,0

Satellite to replace and provide additional capacity for TV, enterprise and mobility services

Cape Canaveral, 31/03/2017 – The SES-10 telecommunications satellite built by Airbus for the Luxembourg-based operator SES has been successfully launched by Falcon 9 from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, USA. It will provide replacement and additional capacity for direct-to-home TV broadcasting, enterprise and mobility services to Central and South America, Mexico and the Caribbean.

With a mass at launch of 5,300 kg and spacecraft power of 13 kW, SES-10 is the 45th Eurostar E3000-based spacecraft built. Airbus has designed and manufactured 10 telecommunication satellites for SES which to date have provided more than 70 years’ operations in orbit providing services to SES's customers across the globe.

SES-10 is designed for a nominal in-orbit life of more than 15 years. Its latest generation Airbus-designed Ku-band payload has a power rating equivalent to 55 transponders. It is equipped with frequency-agile remote-control receivers, increasing the flexibility of the ground control link.

The spacecraft will be positioned in orbit at 67 degrees West, in line with an agreement between the Andean Community (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru) and SES.

With over 50 years of industrial experience, Airbus has been prime contractor for 115 GEO communications satellites. The company’s communications satellites have together accumulated nearly 1000 years of successful in-orbit operations. Today, satellites designed and built by Airbus are the benchmark for in-orbit reliability and in 2016 the company was the leading GEO telecommunications satellite player in the world with 26 percent market share.

But this time, the car is the drone. The drone is the car. And, in Airbus’ fantastic future world, you can seamlessly transition from car to flying car to train all without lifting your butt off the seat. Okay, I’m listening.

Pop.Up revolves around a small, Smart Car-sized monocoque (or “passenger capsule,” as Airbus calls it) that can be used in multiple modes of transportation. The conceptual video, seen above, shows a woman summoning the capsule to her home in self-driving car form. It takes her to a parking garage where a giant quadcopter scoops the capsule up to fly her the rest of the way to her destination. Later in the video we see a row of the capsules embedded inside a sort of train (or hyperloop), too.

The whole system is (theoretically) powered by artificial intelligence, which Airbus says will develop a “seamless travel experience” by dodging congestion. There’s also an augmented reality component, which at one point is used to prod the rider for feedback on a proposed bike lane.

Airbus partnered with Italian design firm Italdesign, which shaped production cars like the original Volkswagen Golf and dozens of concepts for BMW, Alfa Romeo, and more. But this particular design is so futuristic that it plays like concept bingo. Vertical take-off and landing? Check! Zero-emission electric motors? Check! AI and AR?

Iqaluit, a Canadian territory with a polar climate caused by the Labrador Current, allows Airbus’ longest-fuselage A350-1000 version to face-off against one of the most challenging environments for an aircraft. The jetliner successfully completed five days of intensive testing at an outside air temperature (OAT) that fluctuated between -28 degrees and -37 degrees Celsius.

Emanuele Costanzo, Flight Test Engineer at Airbus, said of the results: “The A350-1000 has responded successfully to the ground and flight tests performed in the freezing temperatures of Iqaluit – which demonstrates the already proven maturity and reliability of the A350 XWB.”

All three A350-1000 flight test aircraft have been engaged in the type certification campaign. These latest tests come three years after the A350-1000’s sister – the A350-900 – successfully overcame the uniquely challenging environment in Iqaluit, Canada.

During a press conference at HAI Heli-Expo 2017 in Dallas, Texas, Airbus Helicopters president and CEO Guillaume Faury said the company was developing a demonstrator for the project, known as CityAirbus.

“This is a very exciting one for us,” said Faury. “It’s propelled by electric motors and batteries, so no CO2 emissions [and] lower noise. It’s an aircraft which is designed for up to four people on board for short distances, but clearly well suited for being operated in cities downtown.”

In addition to low noise and zero emissions, Faury said CityAirbus would need to have high reliability and high safety.

“So, it’s a segment which is not far from helicopters, but different,” he said. “There are similarities with the light drones that we see popping up, but in terms of safety, in terms of regulations, in terms of certification, in terms of availability and reliability, we are really in the world of helicopters.

The manufacturer is developing technology for the demonstrator with its fixed-wing sister company in a joint lab. Faury said the project was benefitting from the legacy of the E-fan electric trainer airplane demonstrator developed and flown by Airbus Group in 2014.

Progression looks to be rapid, with Airbus targeting tests this year, and first flight by the end of 2018 or early 2019.

“It will fly first in unmanned, so it will be an accelerated flight test phase, then it will be a manned prototype that will then lead to certification and entry into service,” said Faury. “We are not in a hurry because we need regulation to evolve [and] we need stakeholders to be prepared. But we see the potential being very serious and we are already discussing with cities in some parts of the world which are willing to pioneer this kind of technologies and these kinds of solutions.”

He said these are the “innovative cities of this world,” and that Singapore was among them.

CityAirbus is one of three projects Airbus Group is working on, with the other two being Project Vahana, a self-flying air taxi concept revealed last year by Airbus Group’s Silicon Valley outpost A³; and the Skyways project to develop cargo delivery drones.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9920010566711426}",neutral,0.9920010566711426,0

The first eight-year phase of the European Union’s Clean Sky joint technology initiative – which targets significant reductions in noise, CO2 and NOX emissions for air transportation – came to an end last year.Included in this activity was the flight testing of a more “green” electrical environmental control system on Airbus’ in-house A320 testbed aircraft, while a new high voltage direct current (HVDC) electrical network underwent ground testing.“Phase One gave us an opportunity to investigate solutions in depth,” said Michel Guigou, head of Overall Systems Design (OSD) for Airbus Commercial Aircraft’s Research and Technology team. “Together with Liebherr and GKN, we considered the best use of energy aboard aircraft, typically electrical technologies.” Using electricity for the onboard environmental control system reduces fuel consumption as well as emissions when compared to the traditional method – which draws air from the aircraft’s jet engines.Clean Sky’s first phase also provided the opportunity to further explore HVDC electrical networks that are lighter and less complex than the A/C (alternating current) technology now used on aircraft. “Better architecture and technologies mean we can expect a competitive solution to be ready by 2025,” added Airbus electrical power engineer Gaetan Bisson.Additionally, research into noise reduction technologies for flight paths flown during airport approaches and departures was conducted in conjunction with Thales – evaluating systems to optimally manage the flight phase or trajectory, thereby reducing aircraft operational noise.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9635924696922302}",neutral,0.9635924696922302,0

The extended MTOW provides increased operational flexibility, particularly in highly demanding oil and gas operations.The MTOW extension is available at no extra cost to the customers and only requires an update of the flight and maintenance manuals. The first H175s benefitting from this upgrade are already flying operational missions in the North Sea.Meanwhile, the H175’s ability to fly in limited icing conditions has also been certified by EASA, ensuring the helicopter is able to operate in the challenging weather conditions encountered in environments such as the North Sea. Certification for snow operations was also granted at the end of 2016. Additionally, oil and gas H175 operators will soon benefit from automated approaches to oil rigs, along with a sand filter that will be essential for operations in the Middle-East.In parallel to these development efforts, certification has also been granted in Russia, Mexico and Australia, paving the way to the entry into service of the H175 aircraft in new regions. Certification in the United States, Malaysia, Canada and Brazil will follow.With the oil and gas and VIP configurations now in service, Airbus Helicopters is focused on the development of the Public Services version of the H175, prior to the first delivery later this year to launch customer Hong Kong Government Flying Services. This new variant opens the H175 mission set to operations such as search and rescue, emergency medical services, law enforcement, firefighting and border security.The H175 has so far been in operation for offshore transport in 3 continents where it has been praised by the crews by its outstanding performance and reliability well as for the passengers for the visibility, comfort and low sound and vibration levels. In particular, the H175 has accumulated experience in Aberdeen (Scotland), Den Helder (Netherlands), Esbjerg (Denmark) and Takoradi (Ghana) with launch customer NHV -- who has recently announced reaching the 10,000 flight hours milestone -- and also in the Gulf of Mexico with Pegaso.

Airbus is proposing a new solution for avoiding rush hour: fly over it.

The aircraft manufacturer revealed its vision for a car that can be airlifted by a drone on Tuesday. Called the Pop.Up system, the car-drone combo is making its debut at the Geneva Motor Show, which opens to the public March 9. Airbus designed the system with Italdesign, a design and engineering company.

The key component of the Pop.Up system is a capsule that is 2.5 meters (8 feet) long and 1.4 meters (4.6 feet) high that can house passengers. That capsule can attach to a battery-powered chassis to become a two-seater electric car.

Airbus says that without the capsule, the chassis can drive 100 kilometers (62 miles) on a single charge — so you're not looking at a long-range vehicle concept here.

The Pop.Up's modular design means the capsule can easily unhook from its chassis and get airlifted by an accompanying drone that's autonomous and powered by 8 rotors. (Airbus doesn't provide any insight as to what happens to the chassis once it's left behind.)

Passengers can summon the drone using a smartphone app that can also suggest the best transport solutions, factoring in traffic, ride-sharing demand, and cost.

Airbus even said the capsule could be paired with other futuristic transport systems, like the Hyperloop.

Airbus didn't say whether the Pop.Up will come out of concept mode, but it seems unlikely we'll see anything like it soon. However, Airbus is seriously pursuing using Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) vehicles for urban commutes.

Airbus is working on an electric, single-passenger aircraft for urban transit as part of its Project Vahana. Airbus is also building a flying taxi named CityAirbus as part of a project that's separate from Vahana.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999910593032837}",neutral,0.9999910593032837,0

Increased competitiveness to benefit customers



Dallas, Texas, Airbus Helicopters’ efforts in the field of customer satisfaction are paying off with a recent independent survey confirming a significant reduction in direct maintenance and direct operating costs (DMC and DOC) for the H125, H130 and H135 helicopters, further strengthening the competitiveness of these types on the helicopter market.



A survey published late last year by American consulting company Conklin and de Decker shows a decrease of 15% of DMC and DOC costs for the H135, which is now confirmed as the most competitive light-twin helicopter on the market. Significant reductions were also noted for the H125 and H130, which now benefit from DMC costs respectively 8% and 2% lower than their closest competitor.



Matthieu Louvot, Airbus Helicopters’ Executive Vice President Customer Support and Services said: “Improving customer satisfaction and the competitiveness of our products is at the heart of our daily efforts. The decrease of direct maintenance and operating costs on the H125, H130 and H135 are a visible result of our determination. Customers all around the world will benefit from these improvements on the H125, H130 and H135 which are well positioned on the market.”



These cost reductions were achieved by various improvements such as replacing the Service Life Limit (SLL) of components by an “on condition” scheme, or by extending the Time Between Overhaul (TBO) of certain parts, notably on the H135. Efforts were also made to reduce maintenance manpower and maximize the aircraft availability of the H125 and H130. Over the past four years, Airbus has also reduced the H135’s Parts-By-the-Hour (PBH) programme rates by 19%. This programme is aimed at decreasing aircraft downtime, and supports stable maintenance costs and reduced inventory.



Airbus Helicopters’ innovative HCare offer provides customers with dedicated support solutions enhancing availability and optimising maintenance scheduling. Spanning material management, helicopter maintenance and upgrades, technical support, training and flight operations, as well as connected services, the highly flexible HCare suite of services ensures that each flight is a success and performed with the highest levels of safety.

The Boeing 787-10 took off for the first time from the company's North Charleston, South Carolina, facility just after 9:30 a.m. for a four-hour test flight.

Earlier in the day, the Airbus A319neo also made its maiden test flight from the company's factory in Hamburg, Germany, to its headquarters in Toulouse, France.

The newest 787 is the largest member of Boeing's state-of-the-art Dreamliner family, with room for 330 passengers in a two-class layout. The Dash 10 can hold 14% more seats and carry 15% more cargo than the current 787-9.

With a range of 7,400 miles, the 787-10 is designed to make ultra-long-haul flights while delivering 25% better fuel economy than other airliners its size. The plane, which was unveiled in February in a ceremony featuring President Donald Trump, has been touted as a possible replacement for older versions of Boeing's game-changing 777-200ER.

Boeing has taken 149 orders for the aircraft, which has a list price of $312.8 million. The 787-10's largest customers are Etihad Airways and Singapore Airlines — each has 30 on order.

According to Airbus, the A319neo's maiden flight was used to assess the aircraft's general handling characteristics and the functionality of its main systems. Although the flight took off from Hamburg, the A319neo prototype's test program will be based in Toulouse.

The A319neo is the smallest member of Airbus' next-generation neo — new engine option — series of airliners. Based on the A320neo that's in service, the A319neo has room for 160 passengers and is designed for short or medium-range flights.

"With commercial UAVs and high-speed compound in mind, Airbus takes a fresh look at innovation - Vertical Magazine","Fri, 03 Mar 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvY29tbWVyY2lhbC11YXZzLWhpZ2gtc3BlZWQtY29tcG91bmQtbWluZC1haXJidXMtdGFrZXMtZnJlc2gtbG9vay1pbm5vdmF0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Innovation activity has been intense at Airbus Helicopters as the company is studying a follow-on to the X3 high-speed compound helicopter demonstrator, while rethinking some component designs on in-production helicopters to reduce costs. Even less conventional is the use the airframer is considering for near-future electric propulsion technology, planning to fly the prototype of an autonomous urban air taxi by year-end. To achieve this aim, engineers have been using new research and development methods.

Developed under Europe’s Clean Sky 2 public-private partnership in aerospace research, the compound helicopter demonstrator will have its preliminary design review this year. The critical design review is scheduled for 2018 and the first flight for 2020. The schedule has thus slipped by one year since Airbus unveiled the project in June 2016.

The target cruise speed is 190 knots. This is slower than the 220 knots that Airbus was referring to when the X3 was test-flown in the early 2010s, but still higher than the usual 140-150 knot cruise speed for a conventional helicopter. Airbus’ goal is to fly fast at reduced cost. Thanks to the better efficiency of the architecture, the increase in speed will go along with a proportionally smaller increase in hourly cost, Tomasz Krysinski, head of research and innovation at Airbus Helicopters, explained. The bottom line is an expected 25 percent lower cost per passenger-mile.

Compared to the X3, which was reusing components from other aircraft, the 2020 demonstrator will be “optimal,” Krysinski said. For example, the shafts linking the main gearbox to the two propellers will use no bearing. Thanks to a high-voltage electric system architecture, cruise flight on a single engine – for better fuel efficiency – becomes possible. “A high-voltage electric starter can swiftly restart the dormant engine, if needed,” Krysinski explains.

In electric propulsion, “there is not so long between now and an application,” said Jean-Brice Dumont, then-executive VP of engineering (he has since moved to an equivalent role at Airbus Commercial Aircraft). “With a reasonable improvement in electric energy storage, we can aim at flying electric in the near future.” This would be for limited durations, however.

Airbus Helicopters is thus supporting Project Vahana, a self-flying air taxi concept revealed last year by Airbus Group’s Silicon Valley outpost A³. Do seasoned engineers in Marignane and Donauwörth have to give reality checks to their new Californian colleagues? “Some people in my team would put it that way; but the intent is to bring disruption. Guys from a different environment can bring new ideas. We have chaired Vahana’s critical design review and we respect their work – these two ways of innovating complement each other very well,” Dumont answered.

Perhaps less demanding a project — as it is only required to carry small, non-human payloads — the Skyways joint project with the National University of Singapore is scheduled to begin operations by year-end. A parcel delivery system with four or five stations on the campus, it will use small unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). Two prototypes have been flying in Marignane.

The idea is to test a last-mile delivery system at a small scale. The UAVs will draw from the aerospace sector, for its safety standards, and the toy market, for its low costs. A profitable system at the scale of a large city would require 200 UAVs flying 18 hours per day for a combined 15 million flights per year, according to Airbus’ estimate. “We believe we will take something out of this, maybe not carrying parcels,” Skyways project leader Tristan Serretta says.

Meanwhile, innovation is finding its way into in-production helicopters like Airbus’ light helicopter range. A composite-material Fenestron shrouded tailrotor will soon be produced as a single component. An aft transmission shaft has been redesigned and a new manufacturing process is being considered. Therefore, the shaft will require a single bearing, instead of the current six bearings.

Joint work with external researchers may help find new ideas. A university in the neighboring city of Marseille is looking at bio-inspired engineering and Airbus Helicopters is keeping an eye on it for future mechanical component design. “When we look at the functionalities of our mechanical parts, we can see nature has a different design for the same functionalities,” an Airbus engineer said.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7067469358444214}",positive,0.7067469358444214,1
Airbus may ditch A380's grand staircase as sales tumble - CNBC,"Wed, 08 Mar 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTcvMDMvMDgvYWlyYnVzLW1heS1kaXRjaC1hMzgwcy1ncmFuZC1zdGFpcmNhc2UtYXMtc2FsZXMtdHVtYmxlLmh0bWzSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAxNy8wMy8wOC9haXJidXMtbWF5LWRpdGNoLWEzODBzLWdyYW5kLXN0YWlyY2FzZS1hcy1zYWxlcy10dW1ibGUuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The idea of a slimmed down staircase, as well as adding fuel-saving wingtips, is aimed at lowering the huge double-decker's operating costs and boosting its fuel efficiency.

Airbus is considering doing away with one of the hallmarks of its A380 superjumbo, a ""grand staircase"" echoing the era of cruise ships, as it looks to revive sales of the world's largest airliner, industry sources said.

The provisionally dubbed A380-Plus makeover would add 40-50 seats to increase the standard interior's capacity to more than 600 seats which would help airlines reduce their costs per passenger.

To make room for those extra passengers, the A380 would do away with the double staircase at the front of the plane in favour of something more compact.

The narrower spiral staircase at the back would also be modified.

Airbus officials declined to comment on the plans, which have yet to be finalised and approved.

""Airbus is always studying opportunities to improve our aircraft,"" a spokesman said.

The sweeping staircase is one of the first features passengers see on boarding an A380 and captured attention when the A380 was first rolled out as a 'cruise ship of the skies' in 2005.

However, sales have fallen in recent years due to advances in smaller twin-engined jets, which cost less to fly and maintain.

To help on the A380, the addition of vertical wingtips, more typically seen on smaller narrow-body jets, would cut fuel consumption by reducing drag.

The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the makeover would improve fuel efficiency by around two percent.

They said the changes may also be available as retrofits to existing A380s, but that this had not yet been decided.

The design changes would add about three tonnes to the A380's maximum take-off weight, leaving more room for payload or fuel.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9989350438117981}",positive,0.9989350438117981,1

ANA says an “in-house selection committee” chose the design submitted by Chihiro Masuoka of Tokyo, who proposed a concept titled ""Sea Turtle Family.”

The Hawaiian green sea turtle – according to ANA – is a symbol of good luck and prosperity in Hawaii. And, the carrier adds, “Honu” is the Hawaiian word for the green sea turtle – hence the “Flying Honu” name for the special paint scheme.

For submitting the winning design, Masuoka wins a pair of round-trip business-class tickets that he can use for ANA’s Tokyo-Honolulu service.

airbus' drone-car hybrid takes to the sky when stuck in traffic - Designboom,"Wed, 08 Mar 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc2lnbmJvb20uY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvYWlyYnVzLXBvcC11cC1kcm9uZS1jYXItZGVzaWduYm9vbS0wMy0wOC0yMDE3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"imagine a world where should you find yourself stuck in traffic, your car could vertically take off into the air and fly you to your destination? that’s exactly what airbus x italdesign’s latest drone-car prototype, presented at the geneva motor show 2017, is designed to do. the aptly named ‘pop.up’ system consists of a passenger capsule that works just as well on the road as it does in the sky, thanks to it’s two different and independent electric propelled modules, one for the ground and one for the air. when the vehicle finds itself in highly congested traffic, the capsule disconnects from the ground module and is carried up into the sky by a 5 by 4.4 metre air module propelled by eight rotors. in such situations, pop up becomes a self-piloted flying car, taking advantage of the third demension to get from A to B efficiently whilst avoiding traffic.

the vehicle combines the flexibility of a small two-seater ground vehicle with the freedom and speed of a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) air vehicle. this means the passenger can go exactly where they want to without worrying about switching between different travel modes. airbus and italdesign have created the system as a new user-focused way of moving efficiently through cities, and hopes to reduce traffic congestion as megacities start to become increasingly saturated.

the drone-car hybrid comes in tandem with an easy-to-use app, allowing passengers to book their journey. the system judges the traffic congestion, costs and ridesharing demands, and automatically suggests the best way to arrive whether it be via road, sky, or both. once passengers reach their destination, the air and ground modules with the capsule autonomously return to dedicated recharge stations to wait for their next customers.

mathias thomsen, general manager for urban air mobility at airbus explains the philosophy behind the group’s pop.up concept, stating that ‘adding the third dimension to seamless multi-modal transportation networks will without a doubt improve the way we live and how we get from A to B. italdesign, with its long track record of exceptional vehicle design was an exciting partner for airbus for this unique concept project.’

jorg astalosh, CEO at italdesign elaborates, stating that ‘if you want to design the urban vehicle of the future, the traditional car cannot alone be the solution for megacities, you also have to think about sustainable and intelligent infrastructure, apps, integration, power systems, urban planning, social aspects, and so on.’ the duo hope that their multi-modal vision for thirst dimension travel will be the future of megacity transportation.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9880140423774719}",neutral,0.9880140423774719,0
Airbus H125 helicopters operating on the roof of the world - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 08 Mar 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1cy1oMTI1LWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLW9wZXJhdGluZy1vbi10aGUtcm9vZi1vZi10aGUtd29ybGQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ruo’er General Aviation Development Group (Ruo’er Group), one of the biggest general aviation companies operating flight support base and airport with comprehensive services in China, signed an letter of intent with Airbus Helicopters, for a total of 12 H125s with first confirmed order of four aircraft on March 8 at Heli-Expo.

These H125s will be operated by Lhasa Snow Eagle General Aviation Corporation (Snow Eagle GAC), which is a joint venture of Ruo’er Group based in Lhasa. Snow Eagle GAC will provide these helicopters for emergency medical services, humanitarian relief, aero-sightseeing, and pilot license training in Tibet.

“Ruo’er Group is aiming to become a full industrial chain service provider in China’s general aviation industry. I’m confident that Airbus H125 can assist us to achieve our business goal with its outstanding performance, especially in high and extreme environments”, said Yong LYU, chairman of Ruo’er Group.

“I trust that Airbus Helicopters can enable us in making our ambition to operate the only helicopters fleet on the roof of the world with average altitude of 4,000 meters with its proven product and services.”

In 2005, the AS350 B3 (H125 previous version) broke the world record for the highest-altitude landing and take-off, performed on Mount Everest at 8,850 meters (29,035 feet) – a title still held today.

“The H125’s operating in the highest place in the world marks a breakthrough for this light single-engine aircraft, which is recognized worldwide for its performance, versatility, safety, low maintenance, and multi-mission capability”, said Marie-Agnes Veve, general manager of Airbus Helicopters China.

“This agreement further expands Airbus Helicopters’ Ecureuil fleet in China, which reached 100 last year, and further strengthens our leading position in China’s civil and parapublic market”, she added.

The H125 is a member of Airbus Helicopters’ rugged and proven Ecureuil family. Some 6,000 Ecureuils have been delivered in nearly 120 countries for some 1,800 operators. Together, these aircraft have accumulated more than 29 million flight hours.

Around 550 H125 (AS350 B3e) series are currently in-service worldwide, and are mainly used for high performance missions in high & hot conditions.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9875214695930481}",neutral,0.9875214695930481,0

Weird Commerce: Airbus Takes Commuting Higher - PYMNTS.com,"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vbmV3cy9yZXRhaWwvMjAxNy93ZWlyZC1jb21tZXJjZS1haXJidXMtdGFrZXMtdXJiYW4tdHJhbnNwb3J0YXRpb24tdG8tbmV3LWhlaWdodHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“Where we’re going, we don’t need … roads.” These were the infamous lines spoken by Christopher Lloyd’s portrayal of Dr. Emmett Brown in the 1985 classic movie, “Back to the Future.”

Like hover boards and self-drying vests, many predictions from this movie didn’t come true in 2015, but technology is slowly working its way toward innovative products and services. One area where there has been some advancement is when it comes to flying cars. At the Geneva Motor Show in Switzerland, Airbus unveiled its new flying car concept that it is working on with Italdesign.

Known as the Pop.Up System, Airbus is making strides toward making flying cars a reality. While there are various auto manufacturers on the market now working toward autonomous driving, this may be the first step toward helping to significantly move the needle for cars becoming airborne. An Airbus spokesperson described the system to us in a recent conversation: “Pop.Up is a concept vehicle project aimed to investigate future innovative solutions for transportation.”

Through the Pop.Up System concept, Airbus and Italdesign have co-developed a car system that helps alleviate vehicle congestion on the road through essentially air lifting vehicles via four very large drones. Upon entering this new transportation unit, consumers would have the ability to program where they want to go and be transported by electronic means.

To learn more about what inspired this partnership’s decision to proceed in its innovation, the Airbus spokesperson highlighted the significant issues facing urban areas in terms of traffic on the roads: “Innovation has always been a part of Airbus’ DNA, and Airbus is investigating many possible visions for the future of flight. With traffic congestion projected to hugely increase by 2030, the topic is becoming a more pressing issue for commuters in cities worldwide. With this concept vehicle, Airbus and Italdesign want to spark imagination and conversations on the future of urban mobility and raise public awareness of new transport modes.”

Currently, there are a multitude of traffic issues that are being talked about around the country, but how to best ease traffic congestion seems to be a priority. From administering traffic taxes to conversations about ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft being a hinderance, there’s no shortage of concern when it comes to road travel. Just last week, Los Angeles announced a whopping $5.5 billion plan to help bring traffic congestion to a more manageable level.

For some, being stuck in traffic is a daily occurrence when commuting to and from work, which impacts the rest of consumers’ daily lives. It takes away time that could be otherwise spent on more productive activities, such as finishing up work on time to spend more time with family or on hobbies. We saw evidence of this at last year’s CES in Las Vegas when HARMAN announced its partnership with Microsoft to rollout the software giant’s suite of office tools in vehicle infotainment systems.

Moving into 2017, Airbus’ spokesperson shared how the company will continue to make strides toward its ultimate goal of ensuring the Pop.Up System is available to the public. “This is a concept vehicle project aimed to investigate future innovative solutions for transportation. It is feasible and is the starting point for future analysis by both Italdesign and Airbus in future mobility solutions. The expectations in launching Pop.Up are to stimulate urban transportation analysis about future issues in megacities, providing original, smart and feasible speculative solutions to work on in the future.”

The spokesperson commented on the possibilities of this transportation concept car’s reality and how far off it is with implementation: “This is a project to investigate future scenarios for the next seven to ten years. We believe that, thanks to the rapid evolution of technologies, this time frame is realistic and driven mainly by regulatory and urban compatibility constraints,” she said.

It seems as though the regulatory issues Airbus is referring to may be loosened up as a result of current autonomous vehicle efforts. In September of last year, the U.S. government unveiled its first steps toward this with a new policy to help regulate self-driving cars.

The U.S. Department of Transportation issued a four-part policy that included a “15-point safety standard for the design and development of autonomous vehicles; called for states to come up with uniform policies applying to driverless cars; clarified how current regulations can be applied to driverless cars and opened the door for new regulations on the technology,” according to The New York Times.

As far as expanding the business beyond the Pop.Up System’s future, the Airbus spokesperson assured us that we’re just at the beginning in seeing what this partnership is truly capable of. She elaborated: “Both Italdesign and Airbus are evaluating possible future development of the Pop.Up project. The Geneva Motor Show reveal was a starting point for the evaluation of the future development of the common project.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9974696636199951}",neutral,0.9974696636199951,0

SpaceDataHighway to add third node for global coverage - SpaceNews,"Wed, 15 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9zcGFjZWRhdGFoaWdod2F5LXRvLWFkZC10aGlyZC1ub2RlLWZvci1nbG9iYWwtY292ZXJhZ2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON — Airbus will add a third node to the European Data Relay System (EDRS) constellation of satellites that use laser links to download live imagery from Earth-observation satellites and provide military communications that are virtually impossible to intercept.

The third node, EDRS-D, to be positioned in geostationary orbit above the Asia Pacific region in 2020 or 2021, will expand the constellation’s coverage to near global with some residual blind spots to remain over North America and the northern Pacific Ocean.

The advanced laser telecommunication terminal to be developed by Airbus’ subsidiary Tesat Spacecom will for the first time allow transmitting data between geostationary satellites via laser links. The two EDRS payloads in orbit today lack the ability to talk directly to each other.

“With EDRS-D, we will be able to retrieve data, for example, from a Sentinel satellite over Australia and backbone it via EDRS-D to EDRS-A and downlink it in Europe,” said Hughes Boulnois, who heads the EDRS project at Airbus.

Dubbed the SpaceDataHighway, or the optical fiber in the sky, EDRS can transmit up to 40 terabytes of data per day in near-real-time at a data rate of 1.8 Gbps — almost three times higher than the U.S. Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System, which relies on Ku- and Ka-bands.

The first node of the constellation, EDRS-A, is hosted on Eutelsat-9B spacecraft in geostationary orbit at 9 degrees east. Launched in January 2016, the laser terminal started commercial operations in November, servicing the European Commission’s Sentinel-1A Earth-observation satellite, part of the Copernicus program.

OHB SE of Bremen, Germany, is building the second EDRS satellite, EDRS-C, with a launch expected by the end of this year.

“The European Commission is very happy about the performance of the service,” said Boulnois. “We have demonstrated that we can deliver up to 50 percent more data from Sentinel-1A than what is possible with the X-band channel.”

EDRS-C, to be positioned at 31 east, will provide redundancy over Africa, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East, and extend the constellation’s coverage out to Singapore. Unlike EDRS-A, EDRS-C will be a dedicated satellite operated by Airbus hosting an additional payload from Avanti, the U.K.-based telecoms provider.

Airbus is currently looking for a partner to host the newly announced Asia-Pacific EDRS-D node.

“Airbus is not such a strong player in Asia Pacific so we need a partner that would allow us to expand our reach,” Boulnois said. “Also, from the economical perspective it makes more sense to combine forces with an operator, bringing the EDRS capability and identifying strong synergies with their telecom mission.”

Airbus expects EDRS-D will bring about a step change in EDRS services. Both, EDRS-A and EDRS-C only have one laser communications terminal. For EDRS-D, Airbus plans at least three terminals, which will enable the node to serve multiple customers at the same time.

In addition to downlinking data from low-Earth-orbiting satellites, Airbus is also eyeing the military aviation and unmanned aerial vehicle communications market in the Asia Pacific region.

“This area, from the security perspective, has some challenges and we can see that our customers are asking for more resilience, more secure communication,” Boulnois said.

“We are currently performing demonstrations and in-flight tests with our A310 [Multi Role Tanker Transport] platform to demonstrate air-to-geostationary connectivity via laser links, and we know already that customers are really interested in the key features of this technology,” he said.

Those key features, Boulnois said, are low probability of intercept, low probability of detection, high bandwidth and “the fact that you cannot jam it.”

Boulnois hinted Airbus is already pondering a fourth node to cover North America.

The EDRS constellation, a public-private partnership between Airbus and the European Space Agency, is currently serving only one customer – the European Commission’s Copernicus Earth-observation program. The laser links enable data from the low-Earth-orbiting satellites to be accessed immediately upon acquisition, eliminating the waiting for the satellite to fly over its ground station. The four Sentinel satellites in orbit — 1A, 1B, 2A and 2B — all have laser communications terminals capable of using the SpaceDataHighway.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999850869178772}",neutral,0.999850869178772,0

Aviation specialist Airbus and Italian automotive design, styling and prototyping firm Italdesign‘s new Pop.up concept isn’t just a land-to-air vehicle—it’s an entire transportation system reimagined. At the core is a dynamic capsule that can be affixed to drone propellers or fitted into wheels, but what’s really going on here is a traffic-fighting reimagining of how travelers make their way. Inspired by the fact that in 2030 two-thirds of the world’s population will live in cities, the organizations took it upon themselves to develop a solution. This multi-modal system is a partnership between the airspace and automotive universes, where the base passenger capsule either self-pilots the skies or traverses hyper loops. All of it, according to the proposal, would be accessible by way of an app.

Airbus claims that something like this system could be a reality is as soon as seven to 10 years—though as it stands there are a few technologies referenced that don’t yet exist, including electric propulsion and sense-and-avoid technology. There are three primary components to the present vision: a carbon-fibre passenger capsule, a battery-powered ground module and an air module with eight counter-rotating rotors. A system detects the quickest means of transport. And if traffic emerges when traveling on the ground, an air module can be deployed. Everything returns autonomously to charging stations. Megacities of 10 million people or more are an unavoidable part of our future—and systems like this might just help us navigate them with space and time kept as a premium.

Airbus flags new system to help pick flights - Airline Ratings,"Wed, 01 Mar 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1mbGFncy1uZXctc3lzdGVtLXRvLWhlbHAtcGljay1mbGlnaHRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Manufacturer to unveil initiatives to allow passengers to choose cabins and aircraft type.

Airbus already has a website to help passengers book on its A380 superjumbo.

Airbus will unveil technology next week that allows passengers to pick flights using an aircraft type or cabin configuration.

The European manufacturer gave few details of the “range of initiatives” it will unveil at the ITB Berlin Travel Show but it has been waging a campaign against rival Boeing about seat width as airlines opt to cram more seats into the US manufacturer’s widebody planes.

But any tool that helps passengers better navigate the complex array of seating and cabin configurations — often on the same airline and even on the same aircraft types within a carrier — would be useful for travellers balancing the scales between pricing and comfort.

“Every year, over 3.5 billion passengers travel by plane, and while most carefully plan their itineraries, until now they were unable to select the aircraft or cabin experience of their own choosing,’’ Airbus said in an invite to its March 9 announcement.

“Airbus has set out to change this. The world’s leading aircraft manufacturer will empower the flying public by offering a range of initiatives enabling passengers to put their choices first.”

The manufacturer already has a website, iflyA380.com, where travellers can search for itineraries in which they fly on an A380 superjumbo for all or part of the journey.

The website allows customers to browse and search all flights, destinations and airlines involving A380s, displaying itineraries and pricing before sending passengers to airline booking sites.

Airlines tend to use the superjumbos as their flagship and have configured them with seating that is more generous than on some other aircraft.

Airbus cites research conducted at London Heathrow showing 98 per cent of A380 passengers would recommend flying on the A380 and 60 per cent are willing to make an extra effort to fly on it.

Emirates is by far the biggest operator of the aircraft type but other carriers that fly the A380 include Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Air France, Lufthansa, Korean Air, Etihad, China Southern, Thai Airways International, Qatar and British Airways.

Although the giant aircraft services 110 routes and more than 55 destinations, sales have faltered in recent years and Airbus has decided to cut the production rate.

However, company executives argue the double-decker, four-engine plane will make a comeback as air travel continues to grow and more airports become slot constrained.

Consumers also have the option of newer planes such as Airbus A350 and the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. These can offer additional levels of comfort in terms of higher cabin humidity and pressure, newly designed cabins and seating as well as technology that helps deal with turbulence.

Ultimately, though, the decision on how an aircraft cabin is configured — and how cramped it is — rests with the airline rather than the manufacturer.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999923706054688}",neutral,0.9999923706054688,0
Airbus presents concept for flying car at Geneva Motor Show - Dezeen,"Wed, 08 Mar 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlemVlbi5jb20vMjAxNy8wMy8wOC9haXJidXMtcHJlc2VudHMtY29uY2VwdC1mbHlpbmctY2FyLWdlbmV2YS1tb3Rvci1zaG93LWRlc2lnbi10cmFuc3BvcnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus and Italdesign have revealed their plans to help city dwellers beat traffic with a modular vehicle that is part car, part drone.

The concept vehicle, named Pop.Up Next, was unveiled at this year's Geneva Motor Show. It features a ""passenger capsule"" that can detach from a wheeled base.

Should the passenger get stuck in traffic, the car would disconnect from its wheels before being picked up by a set of motors and taking to the skies.

Airbus, which has imagined the concept alongside Italdesign, believes the vehicle could be a viable solution for easing traffic in overpopulated and crowded cities.

""It combines ground with the air and allows passengers a seamless and faster way of getting from A-to-B using the city sky,"" said Mathias Thomsen, general manager at Airbus.

""Right now, the urban sky is quite underutilised. The grid-like layout of road doesn't actually do it for us, and we think that by combining air and ground we will get a much better use of the space in our cities.""

Both companies predict that the vehicle would be part of a ride-hailing system. Passengers would plan their journey and book their trip via an app, with the system automatically suggesting the best transport solution – either air or ground.

If flight prevails as the favoured method of transport, the capsule would disconnect from the ground module and be carried by an air module propelled by eight counter-rotating rotors. When in the air, it is envisioned that the vehicle will operate autonomously.

Once passengers reach their destination, the air and ground modules and capsule autonomously return to dedicated recharge stations to wait for their next customers.

Related story Airbus to test a flying car by end of 2017

The news comes soon after Airbus revealed that it is planning to test self-piloted personal aircraft by the end of the year as a way of reducing traffic on inner-city roads.

Italdesign's CEO Jörg Astalosch believes the Pop Up vehicle is a glimpse into the future of transportation, where ""the traditional car cannot alone be the solution"".

""Today, automobiles are part of a much wider eco-system: if you want to design the urban vehicle of the future, the traditional car cannot alone be the solution for megacities,"" he said. ""You also have to think about sustainable and intelligent infrastructure.""

""In the next years ground transportation will move to the next level and from being shared, connected and autonomous it will also go multimodal and moving into the third dimension.""

Airbus and Italdesign's announcement appears to support transport designer Paul Priestman's prediction last year that passenger-carrying drones would be the future.

""We've got these electric drones flying around everywhere,"" he said. ""[Electric planes are] just a scaled up version really. I think that's going to get really interesting – it could be the beginning of personalised transportation.""

""It's like going back to the idea of jetpacks, but with lots of little drones,"" he added.

Airbus has filed a number of unusual patents over the years. In 2014 the company applied for a patent on bicycle-style seats that would replace aircraft seat cushions with saddles, and in 2015 filed one for two-storey passenger seating that would make the most of unused cabin space by stacking travellers one on top of another.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997730851173401}",neutral,0.9997730851173401,0

"Airbus' Pop.Up concept may be the best ""flying car""' proposal to date - TechSpot","Wed, 08 Mar 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9jb21tdW5pdHkvdG9waWNzL2FpcmJ1cy1wb3AtdXAtY29uY2VwdC1tYXktYmUtdGhlLWJlc3QtZmx5aW5nLWNhci1wcm9wb3NhbC10by1kYXRlLjIzMzc4NS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"One of the biggest obstacles keeping flying cars grounded isn’t necessarily figuring out how to make a vehicle capable of flight (hello, helicopters) but rather, designing something that can both fly and drive on the streets.

The flexibility of being able to do both is incredibly appealing but physical limitations on both sides of the spectrum impact the ability to efficiently accomplish the other task.

That’s where Airbus’ latest concept changes things up.

The Pop.Up concept, unveiled at the Geneva International Motor Show, is centered on the idea of a multi-purpose modular pod. Here’s how it’d work.

When summoned, a pod-like vehicle would arrive to pick you up and drive you to a nearby flight station. Once there, the ""capsule"" would detach from the car base and attach to a quad-copter that would then fly to the air station nearest your destination.

Upon arrival, the flight mechanism would detach and the pod – with you inside – would reattach to a different car base and you’d be autonomously driven to your destination. The capsule could even work in conjunction with a Hyperloop tube.

It is kind of like Uber’s flying car idea except that everything is included (you don’t have to exit the flying pod and jump in and out of a traditional vehicle).

An Airbus spokesperson told CNET that we could see trials of the technology within 10 years or so although battery technology remains the biggest hurdle… well, that, and getting cities on board with the idea of investing in the tech.

Mathias Thomsen, Airbus' manager of urban air mobility, talks to DW about the project.

DW: The Pop.Up, a capsule that can connect with a driving module as well as a drone-like airborne module, is a cooperation project between Airbus and the transportation company Italdesign. What is the division of labor like?

Mathias Thomsen: We call it a research partnership because really it's been an exploration of new urban mobility concepts. We can see that the automotive industry and the aerospace sector, which we represent, are converging quite a bit when it comes to new mobility technology.

Italdesign is a reference point for the automotive sector when it comes to innovation and engineering. And on our side, we are working on urban air mobility, which is about using the city sky to go from A to B. So we joined forces and looked at different concepts and came up with Pop.Up together.

How flexible is the zero-emission Pop.Up vehicle? Say I'm driving down a road and come to a stop because of congestion. Could the air module pick me up right there or do I need to drive to a certain spot for the connection?

Thomsen: Pop.Up will map your perfect route on the road and above it Image: Airbus S.A.S. 2017/Photo: P. Masclet/master films

At the point of ordering your transportation service, the Pop.Up system will help you choose the best combination of modes of transport, depending on the urgency of your trip and your willingness to pay for different modes. In case you're not in a hurry, maybe you'll drive or do an intermodal connection if it's a longer trip. If you are in a hurry, or if you need to cross a part of town which is very congested, air mobility could be added. So this would be a seamless journey that you order - the different modes would be combined and optimized.

So could the air module pick me up anywhere or is the idea to set up certain spots where you can switch from one to the other?

Such a service is likely to start with certain take-off and landing areas which are fitted with infrastructure to charge or handle the electric vehicles. But in addition to these ""verti-ports,"" as we call them, it should also be possible over time to be picked up and dropped off at any place where there is enough space. So it will likely start with a few number of locations and then over time grow into many more locations.

What about the organizational side of things? Would I have a membership where I can use Pop.Up whenever I need it, or is it more of an Uber model where I pay per trip?

The concept is envisioned as a mobility service that you request with an app or another device and then you're simply picked up and dropped off where you want to go. But the model could also change. Maybe the capsule can be changed and customized to yourself, while the ground modules and air modules are likely to be operated by mobility service providers.

At which height would the air module and capsule fly?

They don't need to fly very high as long as they clear the city buildings. They just need to fly high enough so that they're not a nuisance for anyone. The exact configuration of the airspace remains one of the topics to be determined together with cities and air traffic managers, who are responsible for safe navigation in the air.

That brings me to the next question: are you considering road structures in the air to avoid collisions? These things can go pretty fast, after all - 100 kilometers per hour. They can't just fly wherever they want, especially when more and more of these vehicles go up in the air.

That's correct. The safe route management of air mobility will require new software-based air traffic control. Today the air is still managed by air traffic controllers who are directly in contact with pilots aboard aircrafts. In the future where vehicles like these are self-piloted, the connection between the vehicle and the air traffic system will happen via software and algorithms. Pop.Up would also have to work together with other flying vehicles and objects like perhaps smaller packaging drones.

The Pop.Up in three parts: the capsule in the center can connect to either the ground- or the air module Image: Italdesign

The Pop.Up vehicle would drive and fly autonomously, with the person aboard merely a passenger. So who is liable if an accident happens?

I think the question of liability and responsibility is a very important one and something that we are working closely on. The exact liability definitions and legal frameworks are not yet in place. It's an area that's obviously also being discussed for terrestrial autonomous vehicles like driverless cars.

We expect that over the course of the next seven to ten years, which is our timeline for a project like this, appropriate answers can be provided to these questions.

Who will own the user data that is to be gathered and stored by the vehicle and the mobility service provider?

Our vision here doesn't answer yet how these things are dealt with and by whom. It talks mostly about the service it can create. I think that's a question we will be answering over the course of the technology development.

What's the time plan for Pop.Up? When can I first use it?

At this point, Pop.Up is a study, it's a concept. We will use the feedback from the market, the press and all the people who are engaging in the discussion to develop our own thinking about the ideal urban air mobility vehicle. There is no specific plan to build the Pop.Up right now, but the positive interest we've experienced in the project is likely to influence our design thinking over the coming years.

The fruits of a collaboration between aerospace manufacturer Airbus and design house Italdesign, the new Pop.Up concept blurs the line between the self-driving car and the VTOL flying car. Its removable passenger cell rides on the ground atop an electric vehicle chassis and decouples from that chassis to fly through the air below the whirring rotors of a self-piloted multicopter. Is this how commuters of the future will get from place to place?

Italdesign has done some work on autonomous car design, and Airbus is developing personal commuter drones, so it's not entirely a surprise that the Pop.Up concept finds middle ground between the two.

If you ignore the massive drone hanging above it at Geneva's Palexpo, the Pop.Up looks like your typical tiny, autonomous urban commuter concept. Its zero emissions electric powertrain and glass-heavy styling feel quite at home amongst other compact commuter show cars, like the Honda NeuV and Toyota I-Tril.

But that multicopter wasn't designed to be ignored, especially not at an auto show filled with grounded vehicles. It signifies the Pop.Up concept's unique blend of air-ground capabilities, which starts with an accompanying vehicle-sharing app. As the traveler books a ride, the app presents information about timing, costs, traffic, ride-sharing demand and more, working with the customer to create the ideal route over the ground and through the air between beginning and end points.

The completely autonomous Pop.Up relies on three pieces of hardware to complete the road-air journey. The simple, two-seat 8.5 x 4.6 x 4.9-ft (2.6 x 1.4 x 1.5-m, L x H x W) passenger cell can couple to either the electric motor-driven, carbon fiber ground chassis or the vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) air module, depending upon whether a ground or air route is preferable. With real-time information sharing, the system could even make changes mid-route, swooping in with the multicopter after heavy traffic leaves the ground module stuck in a traffic jam – a dream of literally everyone who's ever spent precious minutes in a bumper-to-bumper backup.

At the end of the journey, the Pop.Up air/ground modules return to their charging stations and await the next app-ordered ride.

The multicopter prepares to drop the passenger cell on a ground chassis

Italdesign and Airbus present the Pop.Up as a way of alleviating traffic problems in future megacities. By utilizing air space above highways and city streets, the Pop.Up helps users breeze past congested arteries while also pulling a vehicle off those overburdened roads.

Beyond just basic ground and air modes, Italdesign and Airbus also imagine a Pop.Up-style capsule integrating with public transportation. The copter could drop the capsule aboard a train car, for instance, either as a more efficient means of local commuting or for a longer distance journey. Whatever means it uses for the specific trip, the system gets the passenger from Point A to Point B inside a single comfy passenger cell, without the need to board or de-board separate vehicles.

""Adding the third dimension to seamless multi-modal transportation networks will without a doubt improve the way we live and how we get from A to B,"" said Mathias Thomsen, Airbus general manager for urban air mobility.

The Pop.Up might look like complete science fiction by today's standards, but Airbus and Italdesign believe a Pop.Up-like transportation system could be realized within seven to 10 years. Of course, that would entail a lot of work and cooperation from many parties, including regulators.

""Successfully designing and implementing solutions that will work both in the air and on the ground requires a joint reflection on the part of both aerospace and automotive sectors, alongside collaboration with local government bodies for infrastructure and regulatory frameworks,"" Thomsen recognizes.

For now, it's just a concept ... but a pretty damn cool one. Watch the video for a vision of how the concept would work shuttling folks around the city and check out more Geneva photos in our gallery.

going to be?

Steven Udvar-Hazy, chairman of Air Lease Corp, already calls it the 797. We agree, though until this is a done deal, we’re calling it the 7M7 while in development.

If Airbus responds with a stretched A321neo–anything but a certain prospect–the working title among the press has long been A322. Airbus officials have occasionally called it the A321 Plus-Plus, a name that will hardly roll off the tongue.

If Airbus were to respond with a new twin-aisle, either smaller than the A330-200/800 (which aren’t selling these days) or about the same size, what would this be called? Skipping to A400 doesn’t work: the name is taken by the A400M, which in any event is a snake-bitten name.

Then, what will the replacements for the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 be called.

For Boeing, the “797” runs out the string of 7 Series choices. For Airbus, folklore says it rejected the name “A360” because of the jokes that would be made about the airplane flying in circles if an issue required a return from its takeoff point. According to the same folklore, “A370” was rejected because the “7” harks to Boeing’s 7 Series.

So: just for fun, let’s have some naming contests.

Assuming “797” is assigned to the Boeing 7M7 project and a replacement for the 737 is the next airplane, what is it named?

Assuming Airbus responds to the Boeing 7M7 with a stretched A321neo, what is it named?

If Airbus launches a new twin-aisle aircraft to compete with the 7M7, smaller than the A330-200/800, what is it named?

When Airbus launches a replacement for the A320, what should it be named?

This incredible drone-car hybrid could transform city travel - CNET,"Tue, 07 Mar 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3JvYWRzaG93L25ld3MvdGhpcy1pbmNyZWRpYmxlLWRyb25lLWNhci1oeWJyaWQtY291bGQtdHJhbnNmb3JtLXlvdXItY2l0eS10cmF2ZWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Watch this: ItalDesign and Airbus reckon this is the cab of the future?! 01:26

The days of sitting in city traffic are coming to an end. An awesome new concept from aircraft manufacturer Airbus paints a future where you sit in a pod that automatically switches between air and ground travel.

Here's how it works: Imagine ordering a taxi using an app from your couch. Two minutes later, it's outside your door. You climb in, and off it drives.

But before you hit that busy intersection, the pod parks up, a giant drone attaches to your roof, picks you up in your pod (leaving the wheels behind) and whisks you off across the city in the air. It'll land at a station near your destination where the pod will attach new wheels and you'll drive the rest of your route.

The road-sky-road route will allow you to miss the busiest streets, giving you a faster and more relaxing journey. It's also all done completely autonomously -- the driving and flying will all be taken care of by the car. All you have to do is order your pickup.

Now, this is evidently a concept idea that we won't see in action for many years, if ever, but Airbus seemed confident about the project's future here at the Geneva auto show. A representative I spoke to claimed it's possible we'll see trials of the technology within 10 years.

The physical technology isn't far off -- sticking a massive quadcopter on a pod the size of a Smart car isn't that challenging, but I'm told the battery technology, which powers all aspects of the journey, needs improving.

The biggest hurdle is getting cities on board with investing in this technology, not only in building the stations that will allow the Pop.Up to transform its shape, but also in creating the regulations and infrastructure that will allow for autonomous vehicles to not only drive on the roads, but take off and land.

Good luck with that one, Airbus.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997169375419617}",neutral,0.9997169375419617,0

George Jetson can eat his heart out. A new flying-car concept can do more than just take to the skies. In fact, the futuristic vehicle takes more cues from ""Transformers"" than ""The Jetsons"" in imagining how humans might get around in the future.

Meet the Pop.Up.

This ""multimodal transportation concept"" is a passenger capsule that can transform into different modes of transit, by attaching to wheels for driving, connecting to propellers for flying or joining a train-like transit system such as the high-speed transit concept known as the Hyperloop.

The futuristic capsule was envisioned by aerospace company Airbus and design and engineering firm Italdesign. The companies say the Pop.Up could unite aerospace and automotive technologies for a new kind of urban mobility. [Hyperloop, Jetpacks & More: 9 Futuristic Transit Ideas]

Airbus and Italdesign revealed their transforming-car concept March 7 at the Geneva International Motor Show, and described it as entering the ""third dimension"" of transportation systems.

""Today, automobiles are part of a much wider ecosystem: If you want to design the urban vehicle of the future, the traditional car cannot alone be the solution for megacities; you also have to think about sustainable and intelligent infrastructure, apps, integration, power systems, urban planning, social aspects, and so on,"" Italdesign CEO Jörg Astalosch said in a statement. ""In the next years, ground transportation will move to the next level — and from being shared, connected and autonomous, it will also go multimodal and moving into the third dimension.""

There are three layers to the Pop.Up concept system, according to Airbus. The passenger capsule is one layer, with its ability to be coupled with electrically propelled ground and air transport (such as a car base or a drone top). The capsule can also be linked to a public transit system (such as trains or a Hyperloop).

The Pop.Up is designed to run on an artificial-intelligence platform, the second layer, that can choose the best route — by ground or air — to the passenger's destination. The capsule will then autonomously travel the selected route, according to Airbus.

A video of the Pop.Up in action shows the system's user interface, or the third layer, which offers passengers an interactive virtual environment. For instance, in one clip, a display in the capsule offers information regarding a museum the passenger is flying over.

The companies did not announce a time frame for developing the project, but they did note that traffic congestion is expected to become increasingly worse. The companies say Pop.Up offers a solution to growing transportation challenges for urban commuters.

Inspired by the new family of Airbus cabins introduced on the A350 XWB, Airspace brings together design and layout features for an interior that is more relaxing, inspiring, beautiful and functional – resulting in a unique and leading passenger experience.

Key cabin elements – such as the galleys and lavatories – will begin arriving this summer for the no. 1 A330neo to be delivered to an airline. Fit-checks have been carried out in advance for each monument, including flight-testing the new overhead bins on board an A330 development aircraft last February.

At Airbus’ Toulouse, France headquarters – home to the A330 final assembly line – cabin equipment suppliers are working side-by-side with the company in a “plateau” environment, backed by rigorous supplier tracking and a major focus on maturity.

Rémi Crépel, head of A330neo cabin at Airbus Commercial Aircraft, said passenger experience and airline performance are the key drivers in the Airspace cabin concept.

“We want Airspace to provide levels of comfort that match the A350 XWB, whichever aircraft it is fitted on,” he explained. “The standard offer includes 18-inch economy seats, bigger luggage bins, new lavatories and a ‘welcome’ entry zone using customisable lighting. Airlines can also select cabin space-enablers, such as the combined lower deck rest area for flight crews that enables as many as 10 extra seats to be fitted in the main cabin.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7496178150177002}",neutral,0.7496178150177002,0

AP

Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner first flight.

Airbus and Boeing both debuted new airliners on Friday.

The Boeing 787-10 took off for the first time from the company’s North Charleston, South Carolina facility just after 9:30 am Eastern Time for a four-hour-long test flight.

Earlier in the day, the Airbus A319neo also made its maiden test flight from the company’s factory in Hamburg, Germany to its headquarters in Toulouse, France.

The newest 787 is the largest member of Boeing’s state-of-the-art Dreamliner family with room for 330 passengers in a two-class layout. The Dash 10 is capable of holding 14% more seats and can carry 15% more cargo than the current 787-9.

“I want to say thanks to the team. This is a big big milestone for us and our customers,” Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said on a webcast of the Dreamliner’s first flight.

With a range of 7,400 miles, the 787-10 is designed to make ultra-long-haul flights while delivering 25% better fuel economy than existing airliners of its size. The plane, which was unveiled in February in a ceremony featuring President Trump, has been touted as a possible replacement for older versions of Boeing’s game-changing 777-200ER.

Currently, Boeing has taken 149 orders for aircraft which carries a list price of $312.8 million per plane. The 787-10′s largest customers are Etihad Airways and Singapore Airlines — Each with 30 aircraft on order.

According to Airbus, the A319neo’s maiden flight was used to assess the aircraft’s general handling characteristics and the functionality of its main systems. Even though the flight took off from Hamburg, the A319neo prototype’s test program will be based out of Toulouse.

The A319neo is the smallest member of Airbus’ next generation neo or new engine option series of airliners. Based on the A320neo that’s already in service, the A319neo has room for up to 160 passengers and is designed for short or medium range flights.

In addition, the little Airbus will specialize in flights into or out of airports with tough operating conditions such as high altitude, high heat, or short runways.

Thus far, Airbus has just 55 orders for the $99.5 million jet. It’s largest customers are Frontier Airlines and Colombia’s Avianca.

Earlier this week, Embraer’s new E195-E2 airliner also made its maiden flight. The next generation E2 took off from Embraer’s facility in São José dos Campos, Brazil for a two hour test flight.

Airbus A350 - Everything You Need To Know - DMARGE,"Wed, 01 Mar 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiImh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRtYXJnZS5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWEzNTDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If you’re anything like us, you get a you little bit excited whenever you see the term “A380” or “787 Dreamliner” on your freshly booked flight itinerary.

Anyone who still has the experience of a long-haul flight fresh in their memories will tell you exactly why: once you get over that 5 or 6-hour threshold, you’ll take any additional bit of comfort and convenience you can get (especially if you’re flying economy).

Now, there’s a new long-haul carrier for the magnificent jet set to get excited about, courtesy of those ingenious Frenchies at Airbus, the A350.

Here’s why its set to make your next flight the smoothest yet.

Improving On All Of The Basics

Of course, before we get to any of the frivolous things that take the A350 from a literal Air-bus to something more, it’s worth looking at how the Airbus A350 makes transporting people through the air safer and easier than ever.

First and foremost, the Airbus A350 can carry a lot of people a very long way. It comes in 3 variants which can seat anywhere between 280 and 366 people in a twin-aisle format. Its maximum range tops out at around 8100 miles, meaning if you took off in Sydney, you’d get somewhere halfway between Dubai and London before its twin-Rolls Royce engines finally ran out of juice. Whether any airlines plan to run routes this long we’re not sure, but you can’t deny that’s some serious mileage.

So then, it’s essentially Airbus’s answer to the acclaimed Boeing 787 Dreamliner, only with an even more intense approach towards ensuring the most passenger comfort and space possible. Wider seats, higher cabin ceilings and ambient lighting offer a sense of spaciousness that’s never been achieved before.

Aside from the new engines, the efficiency of the Airbus A350 comes from the way it’s built. More than half of it is made from Carbon Fibre, while it also has revolutionary wings that morph and change shape while it’s in the air. Airbus claims that the inspiration for this design comes from a bird, which is in a way endearing, and in a way strange. We’d assumed that planes have been taking inspiration from Birds for most of the time anyway.

All of this combined means that the Airbus A350 is by far the most economical, eco-friendly way to travel long-haul, with the new engines, reduced weight and reduced drag making for a saving of up to 25% on CO2 emissions.

What This Means For Your Flight

Hopefully, a fair amount. Of course, a good deal of what you’ve heard about new aircraft in the past has been total wank, with airlines boasting that their new planes now have an extra 5mm width and 0.002 degrees of pitch to the economy class seats, as if you’re supposed to tell the difference after 9 hours of sleep deprivation and turbulence. With aircraft like the Airbus A350 though, things are set to change a fair amount.

First and foremost, the legs on the A350 mean that you’ll be able to fly further without needing to take any annoying stopovers and change plans. Singapore for instance intend to roll out non-stop services from Singapore to LA and Amsterdam, the latter of which is a considerable 13-hour haul, but all the same it’s a ton better than a 9-hour changeover at Doha.

The extra space and flexibility of the Airbus A350’s format allows the airlines more opportunity to play around with the things that actually matter when you’re on-board. Different airlines are playing around with the configurations of their cabin sizes to match the length of the flights they’re using the A350 for. Some have larger economy cabin at the expense of the premium economy offering, while airlines like Singapore Airlines are even downsizing their business-class cabin to make room for more at the back. Smaller A350s will most likely make do without a first-class cabin altogether.

Nonetheless, the Airbus A350 has an impressive level of versatility, meaning that you’ll get the most spacious cabin possible for your flight and class. Before it’s even customised for the airline ordering it, Airbus has already incorporated a wide range of technology to make the mere act of living in their new aircraft as non-demanding as possible.

The Airbus A350 features what Airbus claim is the quietest cabin on any twin-aisle aircraft, up to 20% quieter than other current-gen aircraft, along with brand new air purification technology that cycles the air in the cabin every 2-3 minutes, optimising the temperature and humidity within the cabin as it goes.

Even the bare essentials of the Airbus A350 are able to be tinkered with to allow maximum passenger comfort. Its business-class configuration points the window seats outwards towards the side of the aircraft, making for a better view out of the window. Even in economy, Lufthansa have changed the colour of their seats so that they get gradually lighter towards the middle, negating the effect of the light streaming in through the windows and making the central seats feel less dark and cramped.

Creature Comforts & Business Class

Of course, everything we’ve talked about so far only makes so much difference in making sure you get your moneys worth when you’re paying thousands of dollars for a flight. Air travel should always feel that little bit special, whether you’re in economy or first class. The Airbus A350 is set up to provide just that feeling.

The Airbus A350’s economy seats are wider than ever before and sit inside the most spacious cabin possible, with vaulted ceilings and panoramic windows that adjust electronically from transparent to fully opaque. The overhead lockers are larger, offering space for every passenger to get a full-sized carry-on bag overhead without competing for space with those next to you. Each seat has a 4-way adjustable headrest, and Qatar Airways have even taken the step of integrating each seat’s power box into the seat itself, meaning you get more legroom.

Business class, as ever, takes things up a notch. Airbus A350 business cabins can be configured in either 1-2-1 or 2-2-2 layouts, maximising the space in each cabin to suit the length of the route being flown. Taking inspiration from its bigger brother, the A380, the Qatar A350 also offers an in-flight walk up bar for its business class customers.

A good flight is nothing without entertainment, and while other aircraft have definitely made strides towards making flight a properly plugged-in, interactive experience, the A350 has finally brought this aspect of flight into 2017. WIFI and GMS integration is available across all major airlines, going a step further than the rudimentary dial-up speed internet you used to pay an obscene amount for every hour (although it is still pretty pricey).

All seats are equipped with the latest touch screens, customisable for each airline to provide the best entertainment possible, along with integrated charging, USB and power ports available in just about every category.

(Reuters) - Airbus is considering doing away with one of the hallmarks of its A380 superjumbo, a ""grand staircase"" echoing the era of cruise ships, as it looks to revive sales of the world's largest airliner, industry sources said.

The idea of a slimmed down staircase, as well as adding fuel-saving wingtips, is aimed at lowering the huge double-decker's operating costs and boosting its fuel efficiency.

The provisionally dubbed A380-Plus makeover would add 40-50 seats to increase the standard interior's capacity to more than 600 seats which would help airlines reduce their costs per passenger.

To make room for those extra passengers, the A380 would do away with the double staircase at the front of the plane in favor of something more compact. The narrower spiral staircase at the back would also be modified.

Airbus officials declined to comment on the plans, which have yet to be finalised and approved.

""Airbus is always studying opportunities to improve our aircraft,"" a spokesman said.

The sweeping staircase is one of the first features passengers see on boarding an A380 and captured attention when the A380 was first rolled out as a 'cruise ship of the skies' in 2005.

However, sales have fallen in recent years due to advances in smaller twin-engined jets, which cost less to fly and maintain.

To help on the A380, the addition of vertical wingtips, more typically seen on smaller narrow-body jets, would cut fuel consumption by reducing drag.

The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the makeover would improve fuel efficiency by around two percent.

They said the changes may also be available as retrofits to existing A380s, but that this had not yet been decided.

The design changes would add about three tonnes to the A380's maximum take-off weight, leaving more room for payload or fuel.

Airbus recently shelved plans for a bolder upgrade of the A380 involving new engines due to cost, and announced plans to cut output to one a month due to poor sales.

Story continues

Beyond the new tweaks, the health of the program depends on getting costs low enough so that Airbus can keep output ticking over at 12 a year without losing money, while it waits for what it hopes will be a rise in demand as air travel grows.

""The time will come for the A380,"" Airbus sales chief John Leahy told the ISTAT Americas air finance conference this week.

Airbus was due to unveil a dedicated online booking system for A380 flights at a Berlin show on Wednesday.

The European company's U.S. rival Boeing argues the time for very large four-engined jets, such as the A380 and its own slow-selling 747-8, is ending.

In the short term, Airbus faces another challenge: helping investors find homes for five A380s due to be released by Singapore Airlines after their lease expires.

So far there is no second-hand market for the jets, which entered service in 2007, and several ISTAT delegates said it would not be easy to find takers due in part to the high costs of converting the interiors to suit the needs of a new airline.

"Airbus Considers New ""A380-Plus"" - Live and Let's Fly","Mon, 13 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWFuZGxldHNmbHkuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLXBsdXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The A380 program has not been a resounding success for Airbus. On the contrary, sales have stalled and the wisdom of creating such a large aircraft is often questioned. But Airbus is digging in. In an attempt to save the program, Airbus is considering an even DENSER version of its whale jet.

Two changes are under consideration for a model dubbed A380-Plus. Gulf News reports that Airbus is considering ditching the iconic “grand staircase” on its super jumbo jet, a move that would somehow squeeze in 40-50 more passengers. The circular staircase in the rear of the aircraft would also be retooled. Secondly, Airbus would modify the A380 wingtips to achieve greater fuel efficiency. The result: lower operating costs.

Airbus is not interested in discussing this, stating, “Airbus is always studying opportunities to improve our aircraft” but refusing to address the rumors specifically. Then again, Airbus sales chief John Leahy stated, “The time will come for the A380.”

If you’ll indulge me playing armchair CEO for a moment, I think the Airbus A380 program was a mistake. No carrier is ordering this plane (voluntarily at least) and for good reason: few routes can profitably support a cabin with so many seats. Making the plane a bit more fuel efficient and squeezing more seats into the same space does not solve the bigger issue: the four-engine behemoth is expensive to operate compared to other alternatives. If not, why would there not be more new orders?

Doesn’t the A380 project betray a worldview in which hubs would dominate rather than direct flights? By embarking on the 787 program instead of its own super jumbo, Boeing bet the opposite: that a smaller, more efficient aircraft would open up new direct markets. As the Gulf Carriers struggle, it appears that Boeing’s vision won out.

CONCLUSION

The A380 is my favorite aircraft. I love flying on it and rarely miss the chance to choose it over even the 747 if I have a choice. But consumer comfort doesn’t mean the project was smart. I have strong doubts about a revitalized A380 program that will squeeze even more passengers in and remove the beautiful interior features that make the A380 unique.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8836204409599304}",neutral,0.8836204409599304,0
