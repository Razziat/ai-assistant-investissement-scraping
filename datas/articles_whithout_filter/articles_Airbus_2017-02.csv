Aircraft lifecycle from design to operations - Airbus,"Mon, 27 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE3LTAyLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWxpZmVjeWNsZS1mcm9tLWRlc2lnbi10by1vcGVyYXRpb25z0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus’ A350 XWB jetliner has set the standard for next-generation efficiency from design to operation

When the A350-1000 and A330neo (new engine option) enter service as Airbus’ latest jetliner family members, these aircraft will have completed a comprehensive process called the development lifecycle.The lifecycle’s guiding principle is to provide “key deliverables” at each milestone – which are known as Maturity Gates (MGs), from MG1 to MG15.Once an aircraft’s need is established in response to market demand, the Feasibility Phase (MG1-MG3) is when the programme's overall objectives and assumptions are defined, and the basic architecture and decision solution rankings are made in response to customer needs. Potential new technologies are chosen, industrial scenarios are examined, and the initial team that will drive development in the Concept Phase is established.The Concept Phase (MG3-MG5) includes several major decisions, such as validation of aircraft performance targets, selection of the structure and systems architecture, authorisation of resource ramp-ups, and confirmation of the industrial launch. Key deliverables are defined, including the aircraft design, build and component concepts, plus performance and commercial margins.During this phase, the suppliers – many of whom will work with Airbus through the entirety of the development lifecycle – are selected. Initially, several potential suppliers competing on the same work packages are co-located with Airbus teams on the programme plateau, all of them working in a fully integrated way, using the same systems, tools and design processes. Once a supplier is chosen for a specific work package, it will continue to work on the plateau during the Joint Definition Phase alongside Airbus and the risk-sharing partners.The aircraft truly takes shape in the Design Phase (MG5-MG7), when the overall design and cabin definitions are frozen, the first parts have been made, and all critical design reviews have been passed.This phase also features the bulk of the Industrial and Test Means Development Phases. With the launch of the industrial development phase, the first elements are designed, produced and qualified for the initial aircraft assembly. The manufacturing system – including manufacturing and assembly plants, final assembly line, jigs and tools, testing, transportation, and plant logistics – are prepared and assessed to ensure that the programme will meet its industrial schedule. Furthermore, the testing means – virtual testing and simulators, laboratory benches, static and fatigue test specimens, and flight test instrumentation – are designed and produced.During the final phases (MG7-MG15), the aircraft is built, and intensive tests – including flight trials – are performed in parallel. The objective is to assemble, certify and deliver a fully mature aircraft, starting with the programme's launch customer. At this point series production can begin.To ensure a smooth entry into service, the first operators' pilots and staff train within Airbus facilities, and all the customer support means, tools and documentation are deployed in time for the first airline operations.Once the processes for industrial production are streamlined and running robustly and operational feedback has been received, the development project is closed and the programme is transformed into the series production mode. The lessons learned are taken and shared with following development projects and the lifecycle begins again."

Airbus Group: the old Airbus haunts the new - Leeham News and Analysis,"Fri, 24 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNy8wMi8yMi9haXJidXMtZ3JvdXAtb2xkLWFpcmJ1cy1oYXVudHMtbmV3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Bjorn Fehrm

February 24, 2017, ©. Leeham Co: Airbus Group (“Airbus”) presented results for 2016 in line with guidance. The Airbus CEO Tom Enders said, “This is the best Airbus, ever.”

Yet everything was not as expected; most of the press conference was spent on how the sins of the old Airbus still haunt the present company.

The problem areas, A400M and A380, both stem from the same time period, 2000-2003.

This was when the old, non-integrated Airbus wanted to show the world it could build the largest, most capable aircraft. The resulting lighthouse projects, A400M and A380, are still not out of the woods.

Group results

The Airbus revenue and net profit were in line with guidance at €66.6bn and €1bn. Net results were cut by one-time charges of €3.7bn (A400M, Group restructuring, A350 ramp), compensated by one-time gains of €2bn (Dassault sale, Launchers JV).

The A400M provision of €2.2bn (€1bn in 4Q) was higher than expected. Airbus expects more trouble in this program. The Group will now seek a cap on penalties from its troublesome 6-nation customer group.

Apart from A400M (and a to slow A380 program), Airbus is fine. The Group completed its last integration step, realizing that 72% of revenues are from commercial aircraft. The Commercial Aircraft division and the Space segment are the highlights, while Helicopters is doing OK in a bear market. Defense (ex-A400M) is soldiering on in a non-expanding market. The guidance for 2017 was unchanged.

A400M

Airbus added €1.2bn in write-offs in 4Q2016 to the €1bn it had announced previously. The provision is necessary to cover the costs of customer damages claims and to ready the full capabilities of the A400M.

Airbus can no longer accept that the six Nations and their procurement agency, OCCAM, do not help with the program. The board directed Airbus to seek concessions on damages and more flexibility on requirements to get the program on track. It remains to be seen how willing the customer Nations are to help Airbus with the outstanding issues with the A400M.

“There is no question the aircraft is the world’s most capable and advanced military transporter,” says Enders, “but we can’t have six different meanings on what is an acceptable adaptation of the requirements so we can deliver a finalized aircraft.”

A320

Airbus plans to deliver close to three times the 2016 deliveries of 68 aircraft, i.e., around 200 units. Key to achieving the target will be engine deliveries, especially from Pratt & Whitney. The Pratt & Whitney engine still has some issues to resolve, according to Group COO and Commercial division head, Fabrice Bregier.

A330

The A330neo program is running to plan, with first flight at end of the second quarter. Delivery is set for first half 2018. The expectation is the neo version will guarantee a continued production rate of 6-7 aircraft a month for the A330 program.

A350

The A350-1000 version is flying with its three prototypes. Deliveries of the -900 version are increasing to plan, but cabin equipment deliveries are on the critical line. The merger process of Safran and Zodiac groups “must not affect cabin equipment deliveries,” warns Bregier.

A380

Airbus is convinced this large aircraft will have its time. But it’s large for today’s market. With the doubling of world travel, “it’s about keeping the production at one a month until the market picks up,” said Bregier. “To make that without losses, we are reducing the fixed costs and streamlining the production process.”

Guidance

Airbus forecast more than 700 commercial deliveries this year, up from 2016.

Analyst reaction

Bernstein Research (Outperform)

A350 delivered 23 aircraft in the quarter, meeting the annual delivery target with 49 delivered. The press release noted good progress was made on reducing out-of-sequence work, but supply chain bottlenecks remain. Management expect to continue to ramp in 2017 and meet the target of rate 10/month by end of 2018.

A320neo deliveries are progressing and 68 were delivered in 2016. Airbus noted challenges remain with the ramp, and they expect deliveries in 2017 (guidance ~200) to be back-end loaded again.

Raymond James (Strong Buy)

Airbus’ 4Q 2016 results were slightly mixed, in our view, although there is no change to the big components of the story. It posted a strong 4Q beat vs.

consensus, driven by margins and revenues at the core business, Airbus Commercial Aircraft, with good cash flow and the newly-introduced FY 2017 guidance, which is typically conservative at an early stage in the year, appears to be in-line with current consensus. The snag was in a higher-than-expected charge on the A400M programme of €1.2bn in 4Q, which has become a protracted bleed of profit and cash, and it seems from Reuters headlines this morning, little progress is being made in negotiations with government customers related to this compensation.

Wells Fargo (Overweight)

Airbus said cancellations remain low and were about 2% of the backlog (excluding ceo to neo conversions).

2017 Guidance. Airbus expects to deliver more than 700 aircraft (vs. 650 in 2016) with mid-single digit growth in adjusted EBIT and FCF (before M&A). In addition, Airbus said it will see a working capital increase from the A320 and A350 ramp-up as it builds inventory buffers in 2017 to smooth the delivery profile beyond 2017 and 2018.

A China state-owned manufacturer first unveiled the C919 in November 2015, leaving analysts wondering whether it can compete with major manufacturers such as Airbus and Boeing.

The single-aisle aircraft, which can seat 168 passengers, has now installed its on-board system and undertaken a series of load tests.

The People's Daily Online said Tuesday that test results confirm ""that the framework of the jetliner is strong enough to support future navigation.""

The plane, produced by the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC), was originally scheduled to make its debut journey in 2015, but the date was pushed back to satisfy additional testing."

"Czech, Swiss militaries could lease Airbus A400M from Germany - Defense News","Tue, 14 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXIvMjAxNy8wMi8xNC9jemVjaC1zd2lzcy1taWxpdGFyaWVzLWNvdWxkLWxlYXNlLWFpcmJ1cy1hNDAwbS1mcm9tLWdlcm1hbnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WARSAW, Poland — The Czech Ministry of Defence and Armed Forces and the Swiss Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports are considering a joint lease of 13 Airbus A400M transport aircraft from the German Bundeswehr. The Czech ministry is awaiting an official offer from Berlin, according to Petr Medek, the ministry's spokesman.

""We expect that, in the coming weeks or months, we will obtain a concrete proposal to cooperate from the German side, and subsequently, it will be internally analyzed by the ministry,"" Medek told local daily Pravo.

To expand and upgrade its transport aircraft fleet, Prague has been planning to acquire at least two new aircraft, with some of the considered options including Lockheed Martin's C-130 Hercules or Embraer's KC-390 aircraft.







Currently, the Czech armed forces operate 17 transport aircraft, including the Soviet-designed Yakovlev Yak-40 and local make Let L-410, as well as the Bombardier CL-601 Challenger and the Airbus CASA C-295M aircraft, according to data from the Defence Ministry. The country's military also owns two Airbus A-319 CJs.



Germany's Defence Ministry has ordered 53 A400Ms from Airbus, down from the initial order of 60 aircraft. In 2011, the German parliamentary budget committee approved a plan to sell 13 A400Ms to other countries as part of efforts to cut defense spending. However, the Bundeswehr has instead opted to lease the aircraft to Germany's partners, as reported by local paper Süddeutsche Zeitung.

"Airbus Tests Its Modular Plane Interior Concept, Transpose - WIRED","Mon, 06 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS8yMDE3LzAyL2FpcmJ1cy1raW5kYS1zZXJpb3VzLXN3YXBwYWJsZS1wbGFuZS1pbnRlcmlvcnMtY2FmZXMtc3Bhcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The good people of A3, the California-flavored startup-within-a-multinational-corporation at Airbus, calls it a “low fidelity aircraft,” but I'll level with you: Its latest experiment went down in a tent in an airplane hangar.

Still, Airbus had loftier goals than the locale might suggest. Researchers armed with Ikea furniture, board games, and plastic-wrapped meals, wanted to know how people would handle themselves if airlines swapped those cramped rows of miserable seats for something more imaginative. They tested something A3 calls ""Transpose""---a conceptual modular cabin that offers a bevy of in-flight activities: a facial over here, a latte over there, a spin class up front.

Think that's weird? Well, once the plane lands, a crew can pop out one interior and toss in a new one, moving things about to create the next flight’s passenger experience.

If this concept, which Airbus did in December, seems too good to be true, that's because it likely is (more on that in a bit). But unlike many aircraft designs that evoke either hope or horror, Airbus hasn't tossed this idea into the lavatory trash can just yet. It has six people on the concept full-time, and they're getting help from 100 engineers and product designers.

The testing, which involved 66 human lab rats, revealed that people dug the idea, and had no problems navigating the newness. “We found out that during the chaos times, passengers started directing each other: ‘We need a rule here, we need a social norm of how we pass each other,’” says Larry Cheng, A3’s passenger experience design and research lead. Luxury and choice may not be familiar concepts to most economy flyers, but this test indicates they'd catch on quick.

Out of the Lab, Into the Sky

So when do you get to hop aboard? Well, after Airbus gets all those cool interior concepts past the Federal Aviation Administration and its European equivalent. (A3 says talks are in progress, but there’s no real timeline for regulatory approval.) And after it figures out all of the important engineering stuff, like how to run electrical, plumbing, and oxygen and fire systems through a plane with an interior that shifts about.

That's the practical stuff. Then there's the question of whether airlines---the customers here---want highly customizable interiors. “In my mind, you have enough equipment manufacturers building enough variance in aircraft types that airplanes are able to closely match for their structure and market focus,” says Gary Weissel, an aircraft interiors consultant. The headache of storing and changing interiors might not make sense when an airline can just lease the craft it needs, for as long as it needs it.

But the biggest impediment might be financial, because any square footage on an airplane not hosting a human body is losing revenue. “You have to charge people to fly them through the air, because they’re taking up weight and space in a cylindrical tube that’s burning hydrocarbons,” says Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst with the Teal Group. More space to move around means less money for profit-hungry airlines. Airbus says Transpose could defray costs through brand sponsorships---maybe SoulCycle would pay to host cloud classes for high-class clientele?---and by very carefully balancing its tradeoffs.

The good news for you, suffering sardine, is that many of Transpose’s ideas are, in a way, modular. Airbus' work on the shiny stuff, like coffee bars in the sky, could apply to the simpler things that still make a difference, like easily installing newer and cushier seats, or offering à la carte amenities. “It’s very risky, it’s a very different way of thinking,” says Jason Chua, an A3 project executive, “and that’s why we’re running a ton of different experiments.”

So the next time you see a tent in an air hangar filled with Ikea furniture and grown-ups playing ""Operation,"" know that at least they’re trying something new in there."

Flying on Bubbles — Upper Class on a Virgin Atlantic Airbus A340-600 - Airline Reporter,"Wed, 15 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNy8wMi91cHBlci1jbGFzcy12aXJnaW4tYXRsYW50aWMtYnViYmxlcy1hMzQwLWF0bGFudGEtbG9uZG9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Recently, I used my Delta Skymiles for a trip to London. However, rather than flying the genteel Southern airline (aka Delta), I used my miles to book an Upper Class ticket with their joint venture partner, Virgin Atlantic (recently named the fifth-best international airline by Travel + Leisure). I was excited to put them to the test!

I had no trouble booking the trip through Delta’s website. I simply logged into my account, searched for DFW to London. 125,000 miles later, I was booked to go to London on an overnight flight across the pond. My husband, who booked separately, also had no problems making his reservation, even though he paid with actual dollars.

The morning of our flight arrived and we took a taxi from our apartment in downtown Dallas to DFW International Airport, arriving at terminal E where Delta has its outpost inside the American Airlines fortress hub. We arrived three hours early as recommended for international flights, but being that it was just before 6:00 A.M. on a Saturday morning, it took less than 10 minutes to check our bags, get through security, and get in to the Delta Sky Club, where I drank all the Starbucks coffee anyone could ever want and grazed on bagels, English muffins, and other breakfast foods.

Around 9:00AM, it was time to board an MD-88 bound for Atlanta. Since we were first class, we were able to board first and get a pre-flight beverage. I ordered a Bloody Mary, and the Atlanta based southern belle who also doubled as a flight attendant said, “You look so young and beautiful, you are over the age of 21, right?”

“Yes,” I replied. At the age of 30, getting carded is definitely a compliment.

A couple hours later, we were in Atlanta, arriving at Terminal B. Since we had about seven hours to kill (we wanted to make sure we made our connection when we booked the flight), we decided to walk to the international concourse, F, rather than take the plane train. Walking between terminals in Atlanta exposes you to a variety of art and gives you a brief overview of the history of the city, with highlights including the Civil War and Reconstruction, Atlanta pastor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s work on desegregation and civil rights, as well as the 1996 Summer Olympics. It is also good exercise.

When we finally made it to Terminal F, the difference between this one and all the others was immediately apparent and astounding. That is not to say the other terminals are horrible, and renovations to many of them are ongoing, but Terminal F is in a league of its own. It was like stepping into a fancy new two-story mall that just happened to have airline gates attached to it.

Since we were going to be spending two weeks in Europe, we elected to not do any shopping and proceeded to the Delta Sky Club. Unlike the Sky Clubs in other terminals, this one was open, spacious, and had tons of natural light (NOTE: this was before the new Sky Club opened in Terminal B). Other features that set this one apart are showers and a rooftop deck where we could enjoy watching planes take off and land while sipping New Zealand’s signature wine varietal, Sauvignon Blanc. We also helped ourselves to soup (he had Italian wedding and I had an Indian curry), snacks, salads, and other eats that were available during our time there.

Finally the time came to board the plane to London Heathrow. We made our way down to the departure gate where an A340 named “Bubbles” was waiting for us (Virgin Atlantic likes to name their planes). We made our way down the jet bridge, got on the plane and turned left towards the front.

The first thing that stuck out was the purple lighting and 90’s pop music being pumped through the speakers. When Sir Richard Branson launched Virgin Atlantic a couple decades ago, he wanted to make flying a fun experience. Mission accomplished, even if the on-boarding playlist could use an update.

We made our way past the on-board bar to our seats, and each seat also came with its own footrest. The footrest has the ability to double as a seat (with a seatbelt) if someone wanted to sit across from you. Underneath the footrest it was like a little cubbyhole where you could put your smaller personal items while your larger ones went into the overhead bin.

On the seat was an amenity kit. In addition to toothpaste, toothbrush, blindfold, ear plugs, face moisturizer, etc… it also came with a lemon-chamomile spray for the pillow, supposedly to help you sleep better.

As we were settling in, the flight attendants came by to offer a pre-flight glass of champagne and a newspaper. I had my choice between various publications, including the Sun and Financial Times. I opted for Financial Times, or FT as they called it, and began reading while sipping the Gardet Brut Premier Cru, which I can only describe as drinking the tears from an angel.

The flight attendants, dressed in very fun outfits with the ladies wearing red skirts, white blouses, and red lipstick; and the men in purple vests and black pants, were extremely professional. If you fly Delta frequently, an Atlanta-based crew is most likely going to call you honey, sweetheart, etc. This crew, while friendly and you could joke around with them, was definitely all business. This is not a bad thing, just one a difference I noticed.

Shortly afterwards they came by and asked what I would like for dinner once we were up in the air. I ordered a vodka cranberry for my pre-dinner cocktail, and for dinner I ordered a beef filet and paired it with a 2012 Bordeaux. The flight attendant also gave us cards so we could place our breakfast orders. For dessert (or pudding – as they called it) I chose a slice of the chocolate chip cheesecake. The front of the card read “Wakey wakey,” and on the back were the breakfast options. I selected the chocolate hazelnut croissant, paired with coffee.

After everyone had taken their seats and gotten buckled up, it was time to take off. The captain came over the speakers and stated “Here at Virgin Atlantic, we don’t sing, we don’t dance, but we will show you a short video. So if you would, please give your undivided attention to the video monitors and flight attendants. Thank you.”

At that point, the screens that normally showed movies began playing the animated safety video, featuring you, the passenger, in a variety of scenarios including playing a cowboy in the wild west, a superhero, and a spy like James Bond.

%CODE1%

When the video got to the part about flight attendants pointing out the exits and lights illuminating the aisles, the flight attendants were perfectly synchronized. If synchronized safety demonstrations were an Olympic sport, Virgin Atlantic’s crew would win the gold.

After the pre-flight safety briefing was complete, it wasn’t long before we were taxiing into position to get ready for takeoff. Atlanta is the world’s busiest airport in terms of aircraft movements (as of this writing – Chicago O’Hare has been known to have more from time to time) and passengers. So for anyone who has ever flown in to or out of ATL, it comes as no surprise that the runways were busy.

Most narrow body aircraft have their seats perpendicular to the fuselage, so in order to look out the window one only has to turn their head to the left or right. However, Virgin Atlantic’s Upper Class suites on their wide-bodies are angled at roughly 45 degrees to the fuselage, so I had to twist and turn to check out the action occurring outside the window.

As we lined up and got in to position, I could feel the power of four engines revving up and it wasn’t long before we were racing down the runway and taking off into the clouds. Soon, we reached our cruising altitude, and the captain turned off the “fasten seat belts” sign and the flight attendants began serving the pre-dinner cocktails.

While enjoying my drink, I kept turning around and looking out the window to see if I could see any of the great cities of the east coast, but alas, it was a cloudy evening. So, I began reading my book, An Imperceptible Spark by my friend Steven Rice, until they began serving dinner. The beef filet I ordered was cooked medium well, tender, juicy and marinated in a mildly sweet brown sauce. The meal was delicious, and the wine I chose paired perfectly with it. Soon they brought out the pudding, and the chocolate chip cheesecake was divine. It was moist and tasted like it could have been made right there on the plane.

After dinner, the flight attendants were also making their way around the first class cabin, changing the seats into lie-flat beds as us passengers began queuing at the lavs to change into the pajamas we were provided with. The long-sleeved shirt was very cozy, but the bottoms would not stay around my waist even if I pulled the draw strings as tight as possible.

I returned to my seat, now a bed, but I wasn’t tired, so I decided to try Virgin Atlantic’s in-flight entertainment system that so many rave about. I put on the noise-cancelling headphones they provided me with and tried to start browsing the music selection.

After about the fifth or sixth time I poked the screen, I realized it wasn’t a touch screen (Virgin Atlantic’s newer A330s do have touch screens) so I began navigating using the control panel at the bottom of the screen.

Virgin Atlantic does have a humongous selection of music, but for whatever reason I wasn’t in the mood to listen to a lot of the offerings. After creating a small playlist of music, I decided to check out the movies. I was impressed by the options, and since I hadn’t seen Deadpool, I began watching. Unfortunately, it was around this time I started drifting off to sleep.

I am a light sleeper; however, if something is constant – like say, sound from a TV – I can adjust and fall asleep. This happened a couple times while Deadpool played in a continuous loop, so eventually I gave up and went back to music where I picked a long playlist entitled “Country Divas.” It wasn’t long before Dolly Parton was begging Jolene “please don’t take my man,” and at that point I finally drifted off to sleep. I remember waking up one time and looking out the window and seeing lights below and wondered if we were over Iceland (a later review of the flight path reveals we weren’t anywhere close to Iceland), but those thoughts didn’t last long as I drifted back to dreamland.

The next time I awoke, we were just beginning to go over Ireland and our flight attendants were starting to serve breakfast. The chocolate hazelnut croissant was flaky, buttery, and chocolatey, but the British need some lessons in choosing which coffee to serve. After breakfast it was time to change back into regular clothes. Some of the passengers dug into their amenity kits and got out toothbrushes, lotions, creams, etc… but I was just content chewing gum until we could get to our hotel, where we could shower and freshen up.

I returned to my seat and put my belongings in my carry-on and stowed it under the foot rest for landing. The skies over London are some of the busiest in the world, and Heathrow airport only has two runways, so we were in a holding pattern for a bit. However, the wait for the final approach was well worth it.

I began craning my neck to look out the window as we passed over Wembley Stadium (I tried to power up my phone to take a picture, but alas, I was not fast enough), central London with the River Thames, Tower Bridge, Parliament, Big Ben and the Eye below, and several row houses (see the video below of the final approach and landing) before touching down.

%CODE2%

We got to our gate, and here our plane was attached to two jet bridges, compared to just one in Atlanta. After disembarking, we proceeded to the UK’s immigration and customs, where we unfortunately waited about an hour until we were seen by an immigration officer; we got our passports stamped and went to baggage claim where our luggage was already waiting for us. We then headed to the Underground/Tube station (every terminal at Heathrow has its own station) to go to our hotel in Piccadilly Circus and begin our European adventure.

Overall, my first flight in a wide-body plane could not have gone any better (ok – maybe if they served better coffee it would’ve been better, but that’s beside the point). Virgin Atlantic is as known for their service and in-flight entertainment options as they are for their founder, Sir Richard Branson, and the airline definitely lived up to the hype. Delta has picked an excellent partner across the pond.

To Sir Richard Branson, well done.

Ask the Captain: Questions about the Airbus A380 - USA TODAY,"Sun, 05 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmF2ZWwvY29sdW1uaXN0L2NveC8yMDE3LzAyLzA1L2FpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLzk3NDQ0NzY2L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ask the Captain: Questions about the Airbus A380

Q: I've flown on the Airbus 380 several times. It seems to me the taxi speed is slower than smaller equipment. Is this an illusion of size — larger objects appear to be moving slower — and the higher position of seats in the upper deck? Or are there reasons, such as fuel-use and braking concerns, that make it taxi more slowly?

— Dave Middleton, Rancho Mirage, Calif.

A: The A380 is a very large airplane, which has a wingspan of more than 260 feet. The long wingspan means the jet can taxi only on certain designated taxiways and will have the wingtip pass closer to objects and other airplanes. Consequently, A380 captains do tend to taxi more slowly. The weight of the airplane causes increased stopping distances.

You are correct that being in the upper deck and the sheer size of the airplane make it appear to move more slowly, but large airplanes do tend to taxi a bit slower.

Q: Is the A380 too big for practical use?

— George B, Atlanta

A: No, the A380 is an important part of the aviation industry. Though the numbers of airports capable of handling it are limited, it has not proved to be too large. Some airports had to adopt special taxiing procedures for A380s, but they have worked well.

Q: Regarding your recent column about twin-engine jets being the wave of the future: If that were the case, why is the A380 so popular?

— iceman, Georgia

A: Two-engine airplanes are much more widely used than four-engine airplanes. The reliability of modern jet engines allows for the increased efficiency of using a twin-engine airplane over long distances.

Your reference to the A380 must be taken in the context of the total number sold. The Airbus A380 tally is about 320, while the number for twin-engine Boeing 777s, its most direct long-haul competitor, is more than 1,400 delivered, and there are hundreds more on order.

Q: How fast does an A380 fly?

— Submitted via email

A: The A380 flies at the same speed as most jet airliners, about 85% of the speed of sound (Mach .85), which equals about 650 mph or 560 knots.

Q: Why does the A380 only use reverse thrust on the No. 2 and 3 engines?

— Submitted via email

A: The No. 1 and 4 engines are so far outboard that there was concern they would create damage to the area alongside the runway. In addition, some of the debris could be ingested, causing engine damage.

Q: Regarding your recent column about times of flights to and from Europe: I think the schedules have much more to do with time zones and flight times and wanting to avoid late night arrivals or departures. You have to leave North America early in the day to avoid a late night arrival, so better to fly the overnight and arrive in the early morning. The reverse is true coming west — an evening departure gets to North America in the middle of the night.

— Bruce, Houston

A: You make a good point, and it's certainly something the scheduling departments look at.

Airbus pioneered the use of wingtip devices in commercial air transportation, beginning with the A300 and A310. Both of these widebody jetliners – cornerstones of the company’s product line – were outfitted with wingtip fences, arrow-shaped vertical attachments that extended above and below the end of the wing.

Experience gained with the A300/A310 was applied to the wingtip fences integrated on Airbus’ single-aisle A320 Family, followed by the incorporation of wingtip fences and larger winglet-type devices on the A330, A340, A380 and A350 XWB jetliners.

Airbus’ next evolution were Sharklets, the 2.4-metre-tall units developed for A320 Family jetliners that reduce fuel burn by up to 4 per cent while reducing CO2 emissions annually by as much as 900 tonnes per aircraft. In addition to being standard on New Engine Option A320neo aircraft, they are available for new-production A320ceo (Current Engine Option) versions, and offered in a retrofit solution on earlier-built A320-series aircraft.

For the A330neo, its Sharklets increase the jetliner’s overall wingspan to 64 metres, an extension from 60.3-metres on current-production A330ceo aircraft. As with all wingtip devices used on Airbus aircraft from the original A300/A310, they reduce the spiral-shaped vortices that form at the end of wings during flight, which creates aerodynamic drag.

The A330neo (new engine option) – shown here inside an Airbus paint shop – is the fastest aircraft development programme ever at Airbus"

Airbus witnessed a significant uptick in orders in its commercial airliner business in 2017 though frequent setbacks on its military programs significantly damaged its earnings report released on Tuesday.



""We have a particular concern in the military area, that is with our transport aircraft the A400M where we took a charge from the entire year of $2.2 billion… that hurts for sure,"" Tom Enders, chief executive of Airbus, told CNBC on Tuesday.



""But it does not destroy, so to say, the underlying story of the improvement potential that we have ahead of us in the coming years and that goes particularly for earnings and for free cash flow,"" he added.

The plane's engines have been the main source of problems, with seven NATO countries giving Airbus 3.5 billion euros in 2010 to resolve issues. Earlier this month, Germany revealed only one of its eight A400Ms was in use after the German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen was left stranded in Lithuania, when the aircraft broke down on the ground. Another aircraft crashed in Spain killing four crew members in 2015.

The European plane maker has asked governments to renegotiate contracts for the military transporter, which has now led it to write off more than 6 billion euros.

MERLIN will measure the methane content of Earth’s atmosphere to improve our understanding of global warming . Airbus develops a new LIDAR instrument.

Ottobrunn, 17/02/2017 – Airbus Defence and Space, the world’s second largest space company, has signed a contract with Space Administration at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to develop and build all components of the German contribution to the German-French Earth observation mission MERLIN.

The German Aerospace Center and the French space agency Centre National d’Études Spatiales (CNES) are jointly developing this challenging mission on behalf of the French and German governments. With this step, Europe’s two largest space-faring nations have resolved to seek a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that influence Earth’s climate.

As the industrial prime contractor on the German side, Airbus in Ottobrunn, near Munich, was commissioned by DLR to develop the payload and the payload ground segment. As the industrial prime contractor for CNES, Airbus in Toulouse is responsible for the overall system, the satellite platform and integration of the instrument.

“By developing MERLIN through DLR and CNES, France and Germany are making an important contribution to better understanding the causes of climate change,” said Dr Michael Menking, Head of Earth Observation, Navigation and Science at Airbus Defence and Space.

Starting in 2021, MERLIN (MEthane Remote sensing LIdar missioN) will deploy a LIDAR (Light Detecting and Ranging) instrument to monitor the methane content in Earth’s atmosphere from an altitude of around 500 kilometres, and additionally make possible the first-ever global map of concentrations of this critical greenhouse gas.

Highly precise global measurement and mapping of methane concentrations in the atmosphere is only possible from space, as it requires continuous, large-area observation. Key areas such as tropical wetlands, rain forests and sub-Arctic regions are extremely difficult to survey without satellites.

To date, the methane concentration in the atmosphere has been measured from Earth observation satellites that use solely “passive” instruments. These utilise the sunlight scattered by the Earth’s surface to determine the content of trace gases (such as methane) in the atmosphere. They depend on daylight and only produce optimum results when skies are clear.

The MERLIN mission will be the first to use an “active” LIDAR instrument developed in Germany. It is equipped with an on-board light source (the laser) and can thus measure at night and even through thin cirrus clouds. The instrument emits two short light pulses at two slightly different wavelengths. As one wavelength is absorbed by the methane and the other is not, this difference between the two back-scattered signals can be measured and the methane concentration can be determined with unprecedented precision.

With the aid of data on wind speeds and directions, scientists around the world will be able to convert these values into global methane flow maps and determine the actual regional effects of methane. A better understanding of the global methane cycle is urgently needed in order to reliably predict changes in climate and pursue effective climate protection.

New flying AC Class yacht marks two years of successful Innovation

Charles Champion, Airbus Executive Vice President Engineering: “With ORACLE TEAM USA we set a goal to support the team to design a yacht to win the America's Cup Trophy for the third time in a row”

ORACLE TEAM USA have unveiled their new yacht developed in collaboration with Airbus that will race the America’s Cup in June 2017. The American AC Class catamaran embeds many innovations as the result of a two year partnership between the two engineering design leaders where Airbus is Official Innovation Partner of ORACLE TEAM USA.“The new AC Class yacht really displays what a leading sailing champion and a leading aircraft manufacturer can achieve together. We share the science of aerodynamics and we are all very proud of both teams for their pioneering spirit and engagement to excel in bringing the AC Class to reality,” says Charles Champion, Airbus Executive Vice President Engineering. “With ORACLE TEAM USA we set a goal to support the team to design a yacht to win the America's Cup Trophy for the third time in a row. We look forward to seeing this boat flying above water later in June!”Flying and sailing have many similarities in fields such as aerodynamics, composites and structures, hydraulics and control systems, data measurement and analysis. As a result, the new AC Class yacht features lighter and stronger components.A new interface and “high level” control system is required to control the stability of the yacht in foiling condition and since beginning of 2017, Airbus has provided expertise in the design of a “control system”. Improvements in this area were required to enhance the team’s ability to fly on foils for 100 percent of the race time, considered a key requirement to be dominant in this next America’s Cup.“The innovative ‘control system’ technology on this boat is adapted from the aerospace world. This hydraulics control system allow us to actively control the foils and overall stability of the yacht with a significant improvement in performance”, declares Grant Simmer, ORACLE TEAM USA Managing Director. “The relationship with Airbus is beyond our expectations showing flexibility to adapt and propose new solutions according to our needs. We have truly grown and evolved together!”"

American Expected to Add Even More Seats to Old US Airways Airbus A321s - View from the Wing,"Sun, 19 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9hbWVyaWNhbi1leHBlY3RlZC1hZGQtZXZlbi1zZWF0cy1vbGQtdXMtYWlyd2F5cy1haXJidXMtYTMyMXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"More than three years into the merger of American Airlines and US Airways, there’s been little effort to offer a consistent product across the two fleets. US Airways aircraft for the most part haven’t been given “Main Cabin Extra” extra legroom seating in coach, and they haven’t even been given power ports.

US Airways management, after all, removed power from the Airbus planes they inherited when American West took over US Airways a dozen years ago.

As a result there’s ‘good’ planes to fly (legacy American) and what I call the basket of the deplorables (legacy US Airways).

Last month I wrote that American has a plan to finally add power ports to the bulk of the fleet although it will take until the end of 2020 . (They say they’ll be at 85%, presumably not adding power to planes they intend to retire.)

JonNYC who usually has reliable information tweets,

He suggests power (which we know to expect) and more seats. The current legacy US Airways Airbus A321 configuration is 187 seats — 171 economy and 16 first class (no Main Cabin Extra). Presumably they’ve figured out a way to get to 190 seats and offer extra legroom seats in some fashion as well — perhaps tighter pitch (less legroom) in first class in addition to the move they’ve already been making to slimline seats in economy.

One version of the rumor that I’m more skeptical of is American adding a row of first class in the new configuration — although Delta manages 192 seats with 20 first class, extra legroom coach and regular coach so it’s possible.

I checked with American and while they refused to confirm the 190 seat information, they did not deny it either.

Since taking over, former US Airways management has sought to squeeze additional seats into aircraft. They’ve added seats to legacy American Airlines Boeing 737-800s, MD80s, and Boeing 777-200s. They’ve even added seats to US Airways Airbus A319s as those have been renovated with fewer first class seats and the addition of Main Cabin Extra.

Not great for passenger experience, but good for the airline’s cost per available seat mile."
A pioneer of modern helicopter technology: the BO105 celebrates its 50th birthday - Airbus,"Wed, 15 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0wMi1hLXBpb25lZXItb2YtbW9kZXJuLWhlbGljb3B0ZXItdGVjaG5vbG9neS10aGUtYm8xMDUtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy1pdHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

Innovative technology continues to leave its mark on Airbus’ helicopter fleet today

– This month marks 50 years since the BO105 embarked on its maiden flight, on 16 February 1967, in Ottobrunn near Munich. Conceived as a two-tonne-class light multi-purpose helicopter, cutting-edge technologies and materials led to the BO105 being the first helicopter to feature a rigid, hingeless rotor head made of titanium and glass-fibre-reinforced rotor blades.“The BO105 has made a name for itself above all for its versatility, robustness and reliability. The fact that it is still being used 50 years after its maiden flight speaks volumes for the high quality of this helicopter. As a pioneer of modern helicopter technology, the BO105 continues to influence our product range today,” said Wolfgang Schoder, CEO of Airbus Helicopters in Germany. What became known as the Bölkow rotor significantly reduced maintenance costs when compared to traditional rotor heads with flapping and lead-lag hinges, as fewer moving parts were required. Furthermore, the BO105’s special rotor system enabled it to perform with a higher degree of agility and manoeuvrability – capabilities for which it is still renowned today.Since the helicopter’s first delivery in 1970, more than 300 customers around the world have purchased a total of some 1,400 aircraft which have been operated in air rescue, as a police and military helicopter, as well as for VIP, passenger and cargo transportation. The largest customer was the German Armed Forces with more than 200 orders. Some of these aircraft remained in service until December 2016.Some 400 aircraft – around a third of the total number of helicopters manufactured – are still in service today. The longest-serving BO105 carries out aerial work on the Falkland Islands. In total, the BO105 fleet has clocked up more than 8 million flight hours around the world. Airbus Helicopters continues to offer comprehensive service for the light helicopter and guarantees the delivery of spare parts in the long term.In particular the H135 and H145 light helicopters went on to profit from the BO105’s technological achievements. The current successor model to Airbus’ BO105 is the H135. With its hingeless and bearingless rotor head, it has an advanced rotor system with a high carbon-fibre content to extend its service life. In addition, the H135 boasts further innovative features, such as a glass cockpit, an autopilot system and the shrouded Fenestron tail rotor system to further improve the safety and sound levels of the helicopter. In its role as a pioneer of technological progress, Airbus is working on future-focused programmes also today: among them are the X6 helicopter for the heavy segment, which is set to enter service during the next decade, or the City Airbus project, an air taxi for major urban areas.You can find more information, photos and a video about the BO105 and its history on the following website: http://www.airbushelicopters.com/website/en/ref/50-years-BO105_418.html Airbus is a global leader in aeronautics, space and related services. In 2015, it generated revenues of €64.5 billion and employed a workforce of around 136,600. Airbus offers the most comprehensive range of passenger airliners from 100 to more than 600 seats. Airbus is also a European leader providing tanker, combat, transport and mission aircraft, as well as Europe’s number one space enterprise and the world’s second largest space business. In helicopters, Airbus provides the most efficient civil and military rotorcraft solutions worldwide."

Associated Press

PARIS — Surprise new costs for the long-troubled Airbus A400M military transport aircraft sent the European plane maker’s profits plunging last year and will weigh on the company’s financial prospects through next year, even as it forecast a rise in aircraft deliveries and demand.

Airbus CEO Tom Enders acknowledged that “the jury is still out on the long-term success” of the A400M, but insisted “it’s absolutely necessary” to maintain it as long as European militaries depend on it.

Airbus on Wednesday reported that its profits fell 63 percent in 2016 to 995 million euros ($1.04 billion), from 2.7 billion euros the year before. The company reported 2.2 billion in charges on the A400M in 2016, including a new 1.2 billion-euro hit in the fourth quarter as it reassessed the overall cost of the program.

With governments delaying payments because of A400M delays, Airbus warned that cash problems “will continue to weigh significantly in 2017 and 2018 in particular.”

Airbus’ commercial plane forecast was more upbeat, after a year that saw a rise in deliveries but a drop in orders. It foresees a rise in deliveries in 2017 to more than 700 planes, up from 688 last year.

Shares in Airbus sank on the earnings report then rallied, trading at 66.81 euros in early afternoon, barely down from Tuesday’s close.

Airbus management is holding discussions with governments about reducing further financial blows related to the A400M. Enders blamed the plane’s problems on misguided decisions made at the birth of the program in the early 2000s and exacerbated by problems with engine suppliers and delivery delays that led to big financial penalties.

Airbus still forecasts high demand for its popular single-aisle A320 range jets, but are scaling back production of superjumbo A380s amid lower demand than initially expected.

Enders said it is still too early for Airbus to rethink its operations in Britain as it leaves the European Union.

“How can we review it when it’s absolutely unclear what will happen?” he asked. Airbus has 15,000 employees in Britain, making airplane wings and equipment for planes made across Europe.

“We are watching this space, like other industries, and we obviously hope that no additional barriers will be directed or will interfere with the competitiveness of Airbus,” he said.

He also played down concerns about possible U.S. protectionism under President Donald Trump. Noting that Airbus has an assembly plant in Alabama, other plants opening soon and suppliers across the U.S., he said, “I feel pretty good about … our contribution to the U.S. economy.”

Airbus’ chief rival, Boeing Co., beat expectations for fourth-quarter profit despite a slump in revenue from its defense business, and it also forecast a rise in deliveries of commercial jets in 2017."
New version of Airbus' Helionix to be certified this year - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 02 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvbmV3LXZlcnNpb24tYWlyYnVzLWhlbGlvbml4LWNlcnRpZmllZC15ZWFyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters is planning on having a new version of its Helionix avionics suite certified this year for the H135, H145 and H175. Improvements will be seen in the helicopter terrain awareness and warning system (HTAWS) and synthetic vision systems (SVS) on all three models. The H175 will also benefit from a more advanced search-and-rescue (SAR) mode, as well as automated rig approaches.

The software update, dubbed “Step 3” on the H175 and “Maintenance Release 1” on the other two types, will be the same, except for those functions that require special equipment, such as for SAR.

HTAWS algorithms have been improved to recognize a situation when the helicopter is normally close to the ground, Christian Franot, manager of the Helionix program, told Vertical. A lot of false alarms are thus avoided.

The previous version of Helionix did include an SVS but it was only displaying terrain. Obstacles, helipads and objects like roads have been added. The pilot may want to declutter the display by removing some objects, Franot adds.

The digital map has been augmented, too. Ships and rigs are now identified thanks to their automated information system (the equivalent of a transponder). Information is displayed only at the altitude range that is useful for the crew. Moreover, in response to customer feedback, the avionics suite can hold larger maps.

Other customer feedback has also been taken into account. SkyTrack and SkyConnect — two solutions for an operator to locate their aircraft and receive maintenance notifications — can be integrated. The instrument panel has been simplified thanks to the replacement of “hard” radio controls with “soft” controls on a display.

For the H175, the main application of which is in offshore oil-and-gas, approaches and takeoffs have been automated. The GPS-navigation-assisted software program is the same as the H225’s Rig’N Fly, now described as an Airbus family concept. It aims to make approaches and takeoffs safer and simpler at platform-based helipads. Rig’N Fly reduces pilot workload, allowing the rotorcraft’s crew to focus on monitoring flight parameters and the outside environment. Once the approach is prepared, only two pilot inputs are required. The system can be used even if the oil platform has moved. Approach flight paths are thus much more standardized.

On the H175, pilot workload has been reduced for SAR operations, too. A search radar, an optronics system (including sensors in visible light and infrared) and a search light have been integrated. Recent, already certified improvements include automated SAR approaches, specific ground speed integration into the autopilot and automated hover over a moving ship. The hoist operator can fine-tune the helicopter’s position with a joystick.

The latest Helionix update will be available as a retrofit. “For software-related retrofit, we want customers to be able to do it themselves as a download, with a service bulletin,” Franot says.

Helionix uses three displays on the H135 and the H145, and four displays on the larger H175. A two-display variant is being studied as a lighter, simplified version for a smaller helicopter, but without any firm plan for a product development."

When the no. 1 A320 performed its maiden flight 30 years ago today, few could have predicted how this single-aisle jetliner would transform the air transport industry – and Airbus itself.The A320’s initial liftoff, performed from France’s Toulouse-Blagnac Airport adjacent to Airbus headquarters, opened new standards with the revolutionary use of digital computerised fly-by-wire controls on a civil airliner, and the introduction of a wider fuselage cross-section that enabled airlines to offer passengers more spacious seats and a wider aisle.Three decades later, the A320 product line continues as the world's best-selling single-aisle aircraft family – with total orders for more than 13,000 and a production rate that results in one jetliner coming off an Airbus final assembly line every seven hours.The numbers logged by the no. 1 A320 during its lifetime as a testbed aircraft were equally impressive. This milestone jetliner was flown by 110 different Airbus test pilots, accompanied by 20 test flight engineers and 70 flight test engineers; with its tasks including the in-flight evaluations of 29 different jet engines, as well as the development and certification of many Airbus systems.Prior to its retirement in 2016, the no. 1 A320 became “Flight Lab 1,” utilised for tests in support of the European Union-sponsored Clean Sky research initiative and the SESAR Single European Sky research programme.The A320’s first flight on 22 February, 1987 lasted 3 hours, 23 minutes. Today, an A320 Family jetliner takes off or lands somewhere in the world every two seconds – with more than 7,400 aircraft delivered by Airbus and over 11.5 billion passengers carried."

Canada must defend disputed search and rescue plane buy from Airbus - Defense News,"Tue, 28 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXIvMjAxNy8wMi8yOC9jYW5hZGEtbXVzdC1kZWZlbmQtZGlzcHV0ZWQtc2VhcmNoLWFuZC1yZXNjdWUtcGxhbmUtYnV5LWZyb20tYWlyYnVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"VICTORIA, British Columbia — The Canadian government has until mid-March to respond to claims by Leonardo that it — and not Airbus — should have won a multibillion-dollar program to supply the country with new search and rescue aircraft.





The Canadian government announced Dec. 8 that it would purchase 16 C295W aircraft from Airbus in a deal that could be worth up to CAN $4.7 billion (U.S. $3.6 billion). That figure includes the cost of long-term in-service support for the planes.





But Leonardo has filed a motion in federal court to overturn the contract to Airbus Defence and Space. It argues that its C-27J aircraft should be declared the winner of the program because it not only costs less but is a better aircraft for search and rescue missions in Canada.





Steve Lucas, a Canadian-based adviser for Leonardo, said the C-27J has superior range and performance over the C295W, particularly for operations in the Arctic.





Nicolas Boucher, a spokesman for Public Services and Procurement Canada, the department that handled the acquisition, said the Canadian government is committed to a fair and open procurement system. ""A fairness monitor was engaged to oversee and report on the openness and transparency of the competitive procurement process, and reported no fairness issues,"" he explained. ""As the case is before the courts, we will not comment further.""





Airbus issued a statement noting that it would not comment on the ongoing legal battle. ""The C295W is fully compliant with the requirements as set out by the government,"" spokesman Mike Powell said in the statement.





Airbus Defence and Space has teamed with key Canadian firms for the project. Those include PAL Aerospace for in-service support, Pratt & Whitney Canada for engines, CAE for training and simulation, and L-3 Wescam for the electro-optical sensors.





The new planes will replace the Royal Canadian Air Force's 40-year-old Buffalo aircraft and older model C-130s currently assigned to search and rescue duties.





Airbus will build a new training facility in Comox, British Columbia, to support the fixed-wing aircraft fleet.

The Canadian government originally announced its intent in the spring of 2004 to buy a fleet of new fixed-wing search and rescue aircraft, but the purchase had been delayed over the years.





The project was sidelined by more urgent purchases of equipment for Canada's Afghanistan mission as well as complaints made in the House of Commons by domestic aerospace firms and Airbus that the Air Force favored the C-27J aircraft for the fixed-wing search and rescue plane.





Airbus, Leonardo and Embraer of Brazil, which offered the KC-390 for the Canadian program, were the firms that bid on the project. In November, aerospace industry sources told Reuters that Embraer's KC-390 was not expected to win because the aircraft's program was in the development phase and Canada was seeking an aircraft that was already certified. From there, the competition came down to Airbus and Leonardo.

Airbus sees VIP growth in slumping N. American market - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 06 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLXNlZXMtdmlwLWdyb3d0aC1zbHVtcGluZy1uLWFtZXJpY2FuLW1hcmtldC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters released its annual results for North America in early February, revealing a total of 64 orders for the manufacturer in the U.S. and Canada as a slumping civil turbine helicopter market saw just 100 aircraft purchased across the continent in 2016.

Chris Emerson, president of Airbus Helicopters Inc. and head of North American operations, told Vertical that while he had expected it to be a tough year, the final figure represented just 50 percent of the 200 North American sales across the OEMs that the manufacturer had forecast at the start of the year.

The biggest seller was the H125 AStar, followed by the H145, H135 and H130, with a growing interest from the VIP/corporate sector. Of the 64 sales the manufacturer recorded, 20 were to new Airbus customers, and five were first-time helicopter owners. In previous years, Emerson said, Airbus would have added five such customers to its entire global fleet. And, of the 20 new customers, 75 percent were VIP clients.

“This was really hunting, it was intense, [and] it put us in a vulnerable situation at times, because we were talking to customers who really had a different expectation of us,” said Emerson. “We were selling to customers who said they could only do training on the weekends — and we’ve never trained on the weekends. We had to gear up our whole training organization, and the flight line, because you have to have helicopters maintained to be available seven days a week. And, in January, we started our first ab initio training.”

Emerson added that the sale of an H145 to Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones showed the company that there was a realistic market out there of high net worth individuals who would purchase a helicopter to combat increasing commuting times — and this resulted in sales throughout the year.

In terms of other sectors, law enforcement sales were as the manufacturer predicted, the utility market was down, and so was the air medical segment.

“Of course, it was also an election year, and a lot of these [air medical] operators were not sure what was going to happen with Obamacare,” said Emerson. “So I think a natural postponement of aircraft acquisitions was inevitable.”

However, Airbus noted “a bit of a reversing trend” with a pickup in sales of light twins in the air medical market — after 2015 saw a general shift away from light twins towards single-engine aircraft.

Emerson pointed towards his company’s efforts to control more of the completions process as part of the reason for its success with new clients, growing the amount of completions that it managed or performed from 30 to 90 percent.

“All of this goes to managing the customer experience,” he said. “I don’t want someone buying an Airbus helicopter and having a poor experience. I want them buying an Airbus helicopter and going back to their friends and saying, ‘That was such a great experience — you should try it.’ And, in a sense, that’s what happened.”

Other company initiatives included improving the availability of spares and enhancing its engineering capabilities, and Emerson said the company’s efforts to improve its support services were recognized by its customers.

Hope for an Improved 2017

The exact impact of the Trump administration may be hard to pinpoint at this early stage, but Emerson hopes it will result in sales to Customs and Border Protection, as well as an influx of military spending that could unlock some opportunities for the Lakota with additional Army orders and perhaps for initial pilot training for the Air Force.

“They do the Air Force initial pilot training in Fort Rucker where there are 200 Lakotas,” he said. “Doesn’t it make sense to have a Lakota [for the Air Force] as well, where you can benefit from the support infrastructure that Fort Rucker has?”

On the civilian side, Emerson said he was hopeful that Airbus would see some activity around the H160 this year, following discussions it has been having with “a lot” of operators about Airbus’s new medium-lift aircraft.

However, the Super Medium H175, which made its debut in Europe back in December 2015, is still to enter service in North America.

“We’ve come to an agreement with the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] on the certification of Helionix Step Two, which should occur in spring this year,” he said. “With that, the 175 completes its certification in the U.S., and we are working on a handful of deals right now that one could see a delivery in the U.S. at the end of the year, maybe the beginning of next year.”

A major recent development for the manufacturer’s ever-popular H125 was the certification of the BLR Aerospace FastFin system for the aircraft, which will be offered as an option on new aircraft and as a kit for existing AStars.

“Obviously utility and air medical operators are very interested in it,” said Emerson. “We haven’t sold any yet, but we really haven’t been actively marketing it yet.”

Despite the challenges that lie ahead, Emerson was optimistic about the outlook for 2017. “My ambitions are even higher this year,” he said. “I don’t see any reason why we shouldn’t end the year better than we did last year.”"

The sea pilot transfer took place on Feb. 13 in the North Sea, near the German Bight. The culmination of many hours of training, the operation also marked a milestone for the H145 in a new market segment.

Certain ships in the German Bight are required to take a sea pilot on board to assist with local navigation. Wiking has long specialized in these sea pilot transfers, conducting around 55,000 transfers since the company’s founding in 1975, according to its website.

Wiking also supports offshore wind farms, conducts passenger flights for the oil-and-gas industry, and provides offshore rescue and helicopter emergency medical services operations.

In early 2016, Wiking, along with HTM Offshore, took part in a two-day offshore flight trial of the H145 organized by Airbus Helicopters. Equipped with a distinctive Fenestron tail rotor, the H145 is the latest variant of the Airbus (formerly Eurocopter) EC145.

In June of last year, Wiking announced it had placed an order for two H145s in an offshore configuration, to be used for sea pilot transfer, wind farm support, and air rescue missions over the North Sea.

In a press release, Wiking managing director Holger Stockmeyer cited the H145’s increased performance, Helionix cockpit, and four-axis autopilot with auto-hover function as advantages for Wiking’s offshore operations.

“Moreover, the machine offers high performance reserves as well as a large interior, and it satisfies our strict safety requirements for the transfer of persons over the sea,” he stated.

Wiking took delivery of its first H145 in October 2016, and expects to receive the second aircraft later this year.

The H145 in offshore configuration is equipped with an emergency flotation system certified for Sea State 6, weather radar, helicopter emergency egress lighting system, and an automatic deployable emergency locator transmitter."

""The documents arrived yesterday evening,"" the executive said Tuesday. The documents, which are in Polish and undergoing translation, look like a request for information to deliver eight helicopters for the Polish special forces and eight for the Polish Navy, the executive added.



The Polish Defence Ministry also invited Leonardo and Lockheed Martin to take part in the competition, business website La Tribune reported. Poland is eventually expected to order between 50-70 helicopters.



The previous Polish government had picked Airbus Helicopters for exclusive negotiations to supply 50 H225 Caracal helicopters, only to see the present administration break off those talks in October before a contract was signed. That reversal soured relations between Warsaw and Paris.





Lockheed Martin had pitched the Sikorsky S-70 Black Hawk through its Polish unit PZL Mielec, while Leonardo had offered its AW149 through its Polish subsidiary PZL Swidnik.

Airbus Helicopters had offered local assembly of the Caracal at its Polish factory at Lodz, central Poland, a second executive said. The pick of that factory may have pleased the previous government, but the present administration sees its priorities located elsewhere. There was also the need for speed in signing contracts as Poland holds national elections every four years, while France goes to the polls every five years."

First successful launch of the year for Ariane 5

6 more Ariane 5 launches scheduled for 2017

Airbus Safran Launchers is now the major shareholder in Arianespace, and is the industrial lead contractor for Ariane 5 and the future Ariane 6

For its first launch of the year, Ariane 5 successfully completed its mission from the European space port of Kourou (French Guiana) for the 77th consecutive time, placing two telecommunications satellites in geostationary transfer orbit (GTO).

The launch performance achieved by this Ariane 5 ECA was 10,450 kg in GTO (of which 9,569 kg was accounted for by the satellites). The launcher improvement program enabled the inclination angle to be reduced to 4° in order to minimize the energy the satellites need to reach their final orbit.

""I must congratulate the teams at Airbus Safran Launchers and of course those at Arianespace for this first success of 2017, a year which will include six more launches. Together and working more closely than ever, we will continue regularly to improve the performance of the launcher for commercial satellite operators and institutional customers. In an increasingly competitive market, our aim is to make the Ariane 5 launch system even more efficient and competitive,"" declared Alain Charmeau, CEO of Airbus Safran Launchers, from Kourou. ""I also wish to thank the European Space Agency and CNES for their confidence and their unfailing support"".

Operational in the field of commercial launchers since 2015, Airbus Safran Launchers was definitively completed on 1 July, 2016 and became the 74% majority shareholder of Arianespace on 31 December 2016. This new governance makes possible an overall approach to market needs from launcher design and construction up to commercialization, thus reinforcing industrial efficiency and operational flexibility for the benefit of Arianespace's customers.

Ariane 5 is the spearhead of European know-how and one of the most wide-ranging and ambitious space programs in the world. Its flexibility enables it to transport heavy payloads into low Earth orbit, several satellites into medium Earth orbit or, as it is the case today, one or two satellites into geostationary transfer orbit with an optimized lifetime.

Airbus Safran Launchers is lead contractor for the Ariane 5 launchers. The company coordinates an industrial network of more than 550 companies in 12 European countries (including more than 100 Small and Medium Enterprises). Airbus Safran Launchers oversees the entire industrial chain, from management of launcher performance upgrades, to production management, to final adjustment with supply of the mission flight software and, from now on, its marketing through Arianespace. This chain includes equipment and structures, engines manufacturing, integration of the various stages and finally launcher integration in French Guiana.

Airbus engineering powers USA racing yacht - AOPA,"Thu, 23 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFvcGEub3JnL25ld3MtYW5kLW1lZGlhL2FsbC1uZXdzLzIwMTcvZmVicnVhcnkvMjMvYWlyYnVzLWF0dGl0dWRlLWNvbnRyb2wtcG93ZXJzLXVzYS1yYWNpbmcteWFjaHTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Oracle Team USA America's Cup racing yacht relies heavily on aviation engineering to get an edge over the competition. “We are literally now flying above the water,” said Oracle Team USA skipper and private pilot Jimmy Spithill, describing the America’s Cup entry he will command against the best of the rest of the world this spring in Bermuda.

The Oracle Team USA America's Cup racing yacht relies heavily on aviation engineering to get an edge over the competition. “We are literally now flying above the water,” said Oracle Team USA skipper and private pilot Jimmy Spithill, describing the America’s Cup entry he will command against the best of the rest of the world this spring in Bermuda.

Aviation-inspired attitude control systems help regulate the rigid airfoil sailing wings, main sail, flaps, and twin underwater elevators shown on Oracle Team USA's America's Cup catamaran as it's lifted toward the water for the first time in Bermuda, Feb. 15. Photo by David Tulis.

Pierre-Marie Belleau, the head of Airbus business development, said the size and the shape of the Oracle yacht’s dual wings have “huge similarities” to an Airbus jetliner wing. Their profile looks like the silhouette of an A320 wingtip “sharklet.”

There are, however, some unique differences between the two craft.

“In sailing conditions, the top of the sail wraps in a different direction [than the bottom] and creates additional force on the opposite side of the boat, which helps stability,” said Belleau. “It’s quite a different phenomenon and we can measure that very accurately to give us a much better understanding” of the trade-off between the wing providing speed and power, and the drag caused by twist.

The main element of the seven-story-tall sail wing is shaped like a ""D"" at its leading edge and is covered with “sort of a shrink-wrapped membrane,” explained Belleau. “The second element is on hinges and is controlled by hydraulics,” similar to an airplane flap in that both change the shape of the wing. By applying varying hydraulic pressure to three sets of trailing flaps, the overall sail contour can be adjusted to a particular shape depending on weather conditions. “The guys can change the wing camber all the time.”

“Just like an airplane landing, we want to get a really high lift coefficient and generate more force and we’ll put that flap at a really high angle, pretty much like an airplane landing,” said Ian “Fresh” Burns, Oracle Team USA’s director of performance. “If we can get a high angle of attack, we can generate more force and get more energy into the boat and go faster. It’s very similar to an airplane wing. In fact, it looks just like an airplane wing with maybe a little bigger flap and a little bit smaller main element.”

The ""sharklet"" foil wings fly just above the water and are “moving all the time” said Burns, as are the rear elevators, which extend into the water. “Good design means less energy wasted. We have rams, we have pumps, we have tubing” to help push fluid to where it needs to be. “The more drag you have, the slower you go.”

Spithill and his crew constantly manipulate the devices to harness wind energy and turn it into power and speed.

“Most airplanes if you let go of the stick you’ll go straight,” said Burns. “If you let go of the stick on our boat it’ll do a wheelie.” Burns said the yacht is “on that middle ground where you need the input from a skipper because the two key ingredients are how fast his reactions are and how good the control system is.”

When the horizontal wing airfoils were adopted, he estimated that the ships initially flew above the water about 50 percent of the time. With experience that figure rose to 80 percent fairly quickly “and now we’re up to 90 percent flying,” said Burns. It’s now likely “we can fly the whole race, 100 percent of the time,” but not without “a great control system and a crew that can handle it.” The boats “travel very fast, about 30 knots upwind and about 35 to 40 [knots] downwind.”

A month of America’s Cup sailing commences in Bermuda May 26 with teams from France, Great Britain, Japan, New Zealand, and Sweden battling to face the Oracle Team USA defenders beginning June 17. Airbus provided a dozen journalists with an advance look at the engineering that will be on display during the event. According to Spithill, Belleau, and Burns, the crew that touches the water first will likely lose the race.

“The Americas Cup is always a race for the best technology,” said Burns, “and whoever has the best, wins.”"
General Demoted in Retirement Resigns from Airbus Board - Military.com,"Fri, 03 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGl0YXJ5LmNvbS9kYWlseS1uZXdzLzIwMTcvMDIvMDMvZ2VuZXJhbC1kZW1vdGVkLXJldGlyZW1lbnQtcmVzaWducy1haXJidXMtYm9hcmQuaHRtbNIBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGl0YXJ5LmNvbS9kYWlseS1uZXdzLzIwMTcvMDIvMDMvZ2VuZXJhbC1kZW1vdGVkLXJldGlyZW1lbnQtcmVzaWducy1haXJidXMtYm9hcmQuaHRtbD9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Retired Maj. Gen. Arthur Lichte has resigned from aerospace company Airbus Group in the wake of his recent demotion after the Air Force's Office of Special Investigations found that he had engaged in inappropriate sexual acts while in uniform, Military.com has learned.

""Today, Airbus Defense and Space Inc. accepted from Gen. Lichte a letter of resignation from the company's board of directors,"" Airbus spokesman Jamie Darcy said Friday.

Lichte had been a member of the board since 2010. Darcy said the company is not at liberty to release details of his compensation. Lichte ""has cited his desire to focus his full attention on his family at this time,"" Darcy added.

Larry Youngner, of Tully Rinckey PLLC and Lichte's attorney, said Friday, Lichte ""appreciates respect for his privacy.""

It is unclear if Lichte is still involved with Air Transport Services Group Inc., based in Wilmington, Ohio. He was appointed as the ninth member of ATSG Inc.'s board of directors in 2013.

A spokesperson did not respond to a query by press time. In September, the aviation company told Military.com that it too was ""aware of reports of an Air Force inquiry pertaining to his military service, and we will have no comment on the matter until after the investigation is completed.""

Lichte is also listed as a board of trustees member for Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Fla. A university spokeswoman said Lichte was not a member, but did not provide a time frame for his departure from Embry-Riddle's board of trustees.

Lichte, who retired Jan. 1, 2010, as a four-star after more than 38 years of service, was demoted two ranks to major general and will forfeit roughly $5,000 a month in retirement pay, Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said Wednesday.

OSI ordered an investigation into the retired general in August after being notified that a female officer -- who initially had filed a restricted report in July to her sexual-assault response coordinator -- changed her report to unrestricted to involve law enforcement.

The investigation found that Lichte engaged in inappropriate sexual acts with the female officer twice in 2007, while holding the rank of lieutenant general as the service's assistant vice chief of staff and Air Staff director at the Pentagon. In 2009, Lichte, then a four-star general, once again had an inappropriate sexual relationship with the same female officer under his command, the service found.

Lichte was head of Air Mobility Command, headquartered at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, between 2007 and 2010.

Per OSI's investigation and recommendation, Lichte would have faced charges of conduct unbecoming an officer, adultery, and having an unprofessional relationship under the Uniform Code of Military Justice -- but those charges have a statute of limitations, Stefanek said.

Youngner said he intends to appeal the Air Force's decision.

Lufthansa unveils innovative lighting system on new Airbus A350 - Future Travel Experience,"Fri, 10 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ1dHVyZXRyYXZlbGV4cGVyaWVuY2UuY29tLzIwMTcvMDIvbHVmdGhhbnNhLXVudmVpbHMtaW5ub3ZhdGl2ZS1saWdodGluZy1zeXN0ZW0tb24tbmV3LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Share on LinkedIn LinkedIn Share on Twitter Twitter Share on Facebook Facebook Share on Reddit Reddit Share on Flipboard Flipboard Share on Tumblr Tumblr Share via Email Gmail Share on WhatsApp WhatsApp

Lufthansa will be the first airline in the world to use a range of different onboard lighting settings on its new A350-900, which are designed to fit with passengers’ day- and night-time biorhythms.

The innovative lighting system will provide the right type of light at the right time, which will help to enhance passenger wellbeing. Lighting effects will also be used to emulate a “pleasant restaurant atmosphere” during meal times.

The new A350-900 LED technology provides more than 20 different lighting settings in total. Lufthansa will soon retrofit its Boing 747-800s with the system.

“The wellbeing of our passengers is of particular importance to us,” said Dr. Reinhold Huber, Vice President Customer Experience Design, Lufthansa. “So it represents a real milestone for us that we can now achieve these improvements with this innovative lighting technology.”

The use of a range of lighting settings is based on findings from research in the field of chronobiology and on known effects of humans’ day- and night-time biorhythms. Lufthansa has developed the various lighting moods in collaboration with lighting designers from Kardorff Ingenieure in Berlin.

“Our focus is on passengers’ needs when it comes to selecting the type of light to be used. We are thus able to create a pleasant atmosphere which can significantly improve the passengers’ feeling of wellbeing,” explained Professor Volker from Kardorff.

As of 10 February, Lufthansa will be stationing its first ten Airbus A350-900 aircraft in Munich."

LAPD begins helicopter fleet replacement with orders for Airbus H125 AStars - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 27 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2xhcGQtYmVnaW5zLWhlbGljb3B0ZXItZmxlZXQtcmVwbGFjZW1lbnQtb3JkZXJzLWFpcmJ1cy1oMTI1LWFzdGFycy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Los Angeles Police Department will strengthen its Air Support Division this year with the addition of four new Airbus H125 AStars as part of a long-term plan to upgrade its entire patrol helicopter fleet.

Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Capt Sean Parker said the H125 proved to be the most suitable replacement for the division’s fleet of AS350 B2s, an earlier model in the long-running and acclaimed Airbus single-engine helicopter family. “The H125 was the best fit for us for numerous reasons,” said Parker. “The pricing is competitive. The platform suits LAPD’s missions well, and we are satisfied with the reliability of the aircraft.”

Two of the H125s have been delivered and are currently undergoing completion, and two more are scheduled for delivery in the second quarter of this year. LAPD plans to purchase additional aircraft in future years to complete replacement of its patrol helicopter fleet, Parker said.

“The entire Airbus team is proud that the Los Angeles Police Department has chosen to replace and upgrade its existing helicopters with the H125 AStar that we produce here in the United States,” said Chris Emerson, president of Airbus Helicopters Inc. “We take great pride in producing the H125, the finest helicopter available for law enforcement, and we pledge an unlimited commitment to provide LAPD with the support necessary to keep its aircraft working around the clock to protect and serve the people of Los Angeles.”

LAPD’s airborne law enforcement program began operations in 1956 with one helicopter. Today, the Air Support Division is the largest municipal airborne law enforcement operation in the world, with 75 pilots and tactical officers.

Airborne teams provide ground officers with valuable tactical insight and assistance in patrol, surveillance, and pursuits.

The division currently operates 17 helicopters, including 12 AS350 B2s, and one fixed-wing aircraft, logging some 17,000 flight hours each year. LAPD has flown Airbus helicopters since 1988 when it purchased its first AS350 B1.

Airbus Helicopters Inc. produces the H125 at its plant in Columbus, Mississippi, by a workforce that is comprised largely of U.S. military veterans. The highly-reliable, high-performance, multi-mission H125 is the most popular single-engine helicopter among U.S. law enforcement agencies.

Airbus Helicopters will exhibit several industry-leading aircraft models at Heli-Expo 2017, from March 7 to 9 in Dallas, Texas, at booth #7648. The Airbus Helicopters exhibit will also contain a virtual reality experience demonstrating the cutting edge technology of the H160 helicopter now under development. Subject matter experts will be on hand to discuss the company’s support and services offerings, including HCare maintenance and spares support programs, and the Keycopter online portal."

Hot on the heels of a major contract, with the signature of the Merlin instrument, we highlight some successes from the past year and look at what lies ahead with Space Systems’ Head of Earth Observation, Navigation & Science (ENS), Michael Menking.

Michael, having just held your ENS Symposium, I imagine you’ve had the opportunity to look at recent and future highlights with many colleagues?

Absolutely, the Symposium is about acting as one team – engineers, business development and project staff come together to maintain an overview on where we are and where we are going. It is especially important for us to look at our development and innovation projects and have the time to network.

What for you stands out about last year?

Rosetta has to be my first highlight. Never before have we landed a probe on a comet, especially one not designed to do so; not only did we capture the world’s imagination, but the scientific community and general public are seriously impressed by what we achieved. We have shown that Airbus is able to build products at the cutting edge of technology.

Then you look at GAIA, it’s such a great project. We are mapping 1.3 billion stars, and providing data for scientists to study for a decade or more to come.

Another mission I’m excited about is LISA Pathfinder – our satellite is helping prove Einstein’s theories on gravitational waves and the complexity involved in building such a highly precise satellite is mind-blowing! It’s working so well that the mission lifetime has already been extended.

These are but a few highlights from a wealth of 38 satellites operating in orbit and 41 in development, that’s some infrastructure!

The ENS teams have done a great job to make 2016 a success and I am convinced that we will do the same in 2017

Michael Menking, Space Systems’ Head of Earth Observation, Navigation & Science (ENS)

And the year ahead?

Of course, launches are always the most visible milestones, and this year we have five to look forward to. On 7 March the Sentinel-2B optical imaging satellite will join its Sentinel-2A pair to significantly reduce revisit times, while another Copernicus programme satellite, Sentinel-5 Precursor, will lift off in the middle of the year to provide atmospheric chemistry data to improve climate monitoring.

Three more launches are foreseen towards the end of the year: the Spanish PAZ radar imaging satellite is set to complement the TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X constellation ; the Grace Follow-On satellites will start mapping the Earth’s gravity field to a remarkable degree of accuracy, giving an insight into the materials and fluids underneath the Earth’s surface and finally Aeolus, the first space mission to acquire profiles of the wind on a global scale in order to improve the accuracy of climate prediction and our knowledge of climate variability.

In the projects we continue to work on some exciting missions. The Biomass team is working on the final design and looking towards their Critical Design Review. In JUICE we have the challenge to reach Jupiter and design a spacecraft to survive the outer solar system. Two more of our science missions have reached the testing phase and we look forward to seeing the completion of Solar Orbiter and BepiColombo next year.

Our new contract signature last week is an exciting project. The Merlin programme is a joint project between CNES and DLR and we are very pleased that Airbus Toulouse is the prime contractor for the satellite, and Airbus Friedrichshafen are providing the instrument. Merlin will measure in the atmosphere and this is the third LIDAR instrument that Airbus will deliver."
Proven in service: NHV's H175 fleet reaches 10000 flight hours - Airbus,"Mon, 27 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0wMi1wcm92ZW4taW4tc2VydmljZS1uaHZzLWgxNzUtZmxlZXQtcmVhY2hlcy0xMDAwMC1mbGlnaHQtaG91cnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Marignane - NHV Group and Airbus Helicopters are pleased to announce that NHV’s H175 fleet has logged its first 10,000 flight hours. This significant milestone proves this super-medium-sized rotorcraft’s capabilities and reliability in highly demanding operations, especially the transportation of personnel and supplies to offshore oil and gas platforms.The 10,000 hours have been accumulated by NHV’s fleet of eight H175s. The first two aircraft were introduced to the fleet in December 2014 with NHV being the launch operator. The rotorcraft have since completed more than 4750 flights; with certain missions conducted in challenging North Sea weather conditions, and non-stop flights performed to distances of 180 NM with passengers and cargo.“Being the launching customer and fleet leader for this aircraft, we are successfully positioning the H175 as the new standard for oil and gas missions. I am proud that, today, NHV is the only operator with a vast experience in flying this aircraft. We explicitly thank our valued customers and staff for being our partners in reaching this milestone,” says Eric Van Hal, the CEO of NHV Group.The H175’s high level of reliability enables NHV to meet tight flight scheduling in the North Sea, thereby underscoring the aircraft’s high level of maturity from service entry, as well as the suitability of associated services provided by Airbus Helicopters.“I want to congratulate NHV for reaching this very important milestone with their H175 fleet,” said Guillaume Faury, Airbus Helicopters CEO. “With NHV, the H175 has demonstrated its cost-effectiveness, comfort and reliability, setting new standards for offshore operations. I commend NHV for their professionalism in accomplishing this key milestone. They can count on unfaltering support from Airbus Helicopters so they can continue to perform successful missions.”“The H175 is a remarkable program and NHV is to be applauded for so quickly reaching the 10,000-hour mark and maximizing the helicopter’s potential,” said John Saabas, President, Pratt & Whitney Canada, maker of the PT6C-67E engines that power the H175. “This is the first engine in the PT6 family to be equipped with a dual-channel FADEC, an advanced control system that simplifies engine operation, reduces pilot workload, and provides greater power response, performance, aircraft availability and a quiet cabin.”NHV’s H175s have accumulated experience in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Ghana, and Denmark. “We are very satisfied with the H175s”, adds Eric Van Hal. “Our pilots appreciate their excellent handling characteristics, plus the speed and range; while passengers are impressed with the cabin comfort, smooth ride and low noise levels.” NHV will gradually increase its fleet of these new-generation helicopters in the upcoming years.The H175 is designed to meet evolving mission needs in the oil and gas industry, offering outstanding performance and unmatched cost efficiency – with the capability of carrying a full payload to 90 percent of the North Sea’s offshore installations. It also is well tailored for search and rescue in support of such off-shore operations, emergency medical services, public services, VIP and executive transport.Airbus is a global leader in aeronautics, space and related services. In 2016, it generated revenues of € 67 billion and employed a workforce of around 134,000. Airbus offers the most comprehensive range of passenger airliners from 100 to more than 600 seats. Airbus is also a European leader providing tanker, combat, transport and mission aircraft, as well as Europe’s number one space enterprise and the world’s second largest space business. In helicopters, Airbus provides the most efficient civil and military rotorcraft solutions worldwide."
Airbus says it has received ‘oral assurances’ on Brexit - CNN,"Wed, 22 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAxNy8wMi8yMi9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1icmV4aXQtYXNzdXJhbmNlcy9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"London CNNMoney —

European planemaker Airbus has been given “oral assurances” by the U.K. government regarding the impact of Brexit on its business.

“I think we’ve received some oral assurances, but all this obviously is preliminary because nobody knows exactly how this all plays out,” CEO Tom Enders told CNNMoney’s Nina dos Santos on Wednesday.

U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May has said Britain is seeking a complete break with the European Union in Brexit negotiations that are expected to begin next month. That is almost certain to mean trade barriers being erected between the EU and the U.K.

Enders would not comment in detail on the assurances. A spokesman for the government said he wasn’t aware of any discussion with Airbus.

With more than 15,000 employees in Britain, Enders said “any” U.K. government would want to keep Airbus on side.

The aviation giant is headquartered in Toulouse, France, but has significant engineering and productions facilities in the U.K. One large production center in Wales manufacturers the wings used on all Airbus civil aircraft.

In order to protect the company’s supply chain, Enders said he would be lobbying the U.K. and governments in Europe in the hope of limiting any new barriers that might result from the U.K.’s departure from the EU.

“We will not stay passive … we know our interests,” Enders said. “We need to keep our manufacturing, our engineering in the U.K. competitive, and we will try to make an input into these discussions as much as we can.”

Airbus (EADSY) is not the only major employer to hold talks with the British government following the referendum.

In October, Nissan (NSANY) said it had been convinced to invest in its massive production facility in Sunderland after getting reassurances from the British government, though it wouldn’t provide details.

Boeing first?

Enders said that Airbus is “well positioned” in the U.S. despite suggestions that the Trump administration could favor its rival Boeing (BA) as part of an “American first” strategy.

“It’s not that easy,” Enders said of Trump’s rhetoric. “The aerospace industry is very much intertwined globally, internationally.”

The Airbus boss said that the company’s large commercial aircraft, for example, use many parts manufactured in the U.S.

The European firm has a production facility in Alabama, and it builds helicopters for the U.S. military in Mississippi.

But Enders did say that Trump was right on another subject: the need for more NATO countries to spend more on defense.

“I’ve always been amazed by America’s patience with the Europeans when it comes to defense spending,” he said.

“That’s something the news administration is right on target,” Enders added."

Its results had been buoyed by a last-minute surge in civil jetliner deliveries.

Acro’s ‘Series 3 Superlight ST’ slim-line Economy Class seat, exemplifies the fundamental design principles of comfort and simplicity. It includes an aluminium table, sized and designed for complimentary beverage service and the use of a tablet device will feature initially in the Airbus catalogue. Inclusion of Acro’s new Series 6 will follow, pending delivery of the first shipset to a national flag carrier during Q3 2017.

Series 6 is a new generation Economy Class seat suitable for single and twin aisle, and is as much an expression of simplicity as Acro’s current award-winning product lines. The breakthrough has been to simplify the structure in order to maximise living space and to replace the seatback with a composite that is both as beautiful as it is efficient. Series 6 examines the spaces to the left and right of the passenger and finds precious extra room between the armrests, giving increased passenger comfort, a more sophisticated appearance, unequalled legroom, lighter weight and a 50% reduction in parts, greater durability and lower costs of operation.

Chris Brady, Chief Executive of Acro said “This agreement with Airbus is the latest milestone achievement that reflects how hard we’ve worked to grow Acro by investing in our staff, product innovation and supporting infrastructure. Appearing in the Airbus catalogue extends our reach and accessibility to scheduled flag carriers, enabling our growth and pursuing our vision of perfect comfort for passengers.”

Both seats will be displayed at Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg 4th to 6th April 2017, Hall 6 Stand 6C100.

Boeing company uses A321 in website promo - Leeham News and Analysis,"Thu, 23 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNy8wMi8yMy9ib2VpbmctY29tcGFueS11c2VzLWEzMjEtd2Vic2l0ZS1wcm9tby_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Feb 23, 2017, (c) Leeham Co.: A Boeing company, Inventory Locator Service, yesterday posted an Evolution of Boeing graphic on its website that traces key points in Boeing’s history.

There was a problem, however: the airplane at the top of the graphic, which was photo-shopped with Boeing 737 identification, was an Airbus A321.

A Twitter storm immediately commenced after one person saw the Evolution and posted it on his Facebook page.

It isn’t the first time an Airbus airplane showed up in a Boeing-focused promo piece. The promo piece was still up last night, but may not be when the company opens for business in the Midwest today.

The graphic is posted below the jump in this post.

The A321 wasn’t the only problem. A 747-8 was used to represent the first flight of the 747-100. A 737NG freighter represented the first flight of the 737, which was the -100 series. A 787–which didn’t even exist at the time–was used to represent the 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas. And a 777F was used to represent the first flight o the 78.

This isn’t the first time an Airbus A320 was used to promote Boeing.

In November 2013, the Washington Aerospace Partnership (“WAP,” as in upside the head, somehow seemed fitting) used an A320 in a full page Seattle Times advert touting the state as the best place in the US to do aerospace business.

Ariane launcher evolution - Airbus,"Sat, 18 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE3LTAyLWFyaWFuZS1sYXVuY2hlci1ldm9sdXRpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Transforming space

The referenced media source is missing and needs to be re-embedded.

Ariane's birth

Europe's independent access to space

Europe is ready to take a crucial step in space travel with the arrival of Ariane 6. A more flexible and competitive launcher for today’s changing space environment, its development is powered by the same audacity that marked the beginnings of the Ariane rocket family more than three decades ago.

On Christmas Eve 1979, a new rocket blasted off from French Guiana. The preceding few days had seen two aborted launch attempts, which had raised the pressure on the team behind the rocket’s development.

An entire continent was watching: Ariane 1 could finally provide Europe with its own access to space. Eventually, at the third and final attempt, the rocket launched successfully. It was carrying a capsule weighing 1,645 kg, the heaviest payload ever launched into space by Europe at that time.

Exactly 35 years later, on Christmas Eve evening 2014, Patrick Bonguet received a phone call. The voice at the other end of the line – Alain Charmeau, CEO of Airbus Safran Launchers – said he was looking for the right person to manage the development of a new rocket. “Do you want to take the helm?” he was asked. Bonguet said yes and a short time later, he began work as head of development on Ariane 6.

A new chapter for Europe’s space industry

""The first flight is set for 2020 and we plan to reach full capability three years later. At that stage, we will be able to do 12 launches every year""Patrick Bonguet, Head of Development, Ariane 6



The Ariane family is undergoing a transformation with the introduction of Ariane 6, which is being developed by the Airbus Safran Launchers joint venture. It is Europe’s response to the transformation of the space industry, in which private enterprise is gaining a stronger foothold.

Ariane 6 will be a more flexible, cutting-edge update of Ariane 5. “We are passing all the milestones as planned. European Space Agency (ESA) members have fully validated the programme after a successful in-depth review and we are now working on the detailed design phase,” says Bonguet.

Launchers leadership



€3 Billion is the approximate total spending for the development of Ariane 6

The roots of Airbus Safran Launchers are planted in the shared technological history of France and Germany, which dates back to the earliest space programmes, and is embodied today by the Ariane launcher. For more than half a century, Europe has been at the forefront of the civil launchers sector and it leads the world market for commercial launches to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO).

During this time, the Ariane rocket family has matured, increasing its capacity to reach further into space and deploy larger payloads for space agencies and companies alike. Ariane 6 will be available in two- and four-booster versions, to best respond to all commercial and government missions. It will operate in a coordinated approach with the Vega launcher, which is dedicated to smaller payloads.

Innovation and competitiveness via modularity and flexibility

“We have managed to almost halve the recurring price: Ariane 6 will cost 40-50% less than Ariane 5, keeping the same reliability. We believe that cheaper means more reliable, tailoring designs to factory operations,"" explains Bonguet. The new rocket has greater versatility, especially to launch new-generation spacecraft into higher orbits. It will also be able to perform controlled deorbiting and will have an increased volume to carry larger spacecraft, in particular in the lower position.""

""We are changing the industrial model of launchers. The foundation of Airbus Safran Launchers was the first step in this direction"". Patrick Bonguet, Head of Development, Ariane 6



Gains in competitiveness will come from series production of the rocket engines and a more integrated working approach. This is founded on collaborative engineering and the creation of excellence clusters, standardising designs and means at launcher level and maximizing use of assets.

The creation of Airbus Safran Launchers also enables an optimised end-to-end approach, from raw material to launch, and to create streamlined manufacturing flows. Airbus Safran Launchers will also implement new industrial processes and technologies, such as 3D printing, friction stir welding and laser surface treatment.

A family album to be proud of

David Iranzo, Ariane 5 production and operations engineering manager at Airbus Safran Launchers, started working with Ariane 18 years ago. “Before the 1980s, Europe was using US launchers and we were dependent on their conditions,” Iranzo says.

But Europe worked hard to continually improve its technology. Ariane 2 included a longer final stage to increase its launch capacity to over 2,000 kg. Its immediate successor brought a new addition: strapped-on solid rocket boosters to increase the power of its first stage. The launcher was used until 1989.

76 launches on 21 December 2016, Ariane 5 concluded its 76th consecutive successful launch, beating its own commercial performance record by carrying a payload of more than 10.7 tonnes to geostationary transfer orbit

Following the US Space Shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986, Ariane 4, a newly designed rocket able to put up to 4,800 kg into space, became the only available commercial launcher for a time.

The launch rate doubled and the European programme, spearheaded by the European Space Agency, experienced its first scale-up in production. And with the arrival of the current Ariane 5 version in 2005, the launcher became the undisputed champion of heavy-lift launchers and the world leader for commercial launches to GTO.

Reliability from the start

Ariane’s accomplishments are “far-reaching”, says David Iranzo. “Think about many of today’s communication and Earth observation satellites: the Meteosat family, for instance.” Ariane rockets have also launched some of Europe’s most outstanding space missions, like the Planck and Herschel observatories, the ATV International Space Station space freighter and the Rosetta comet probe, the first spacecraft to orbit and land on a comet.

Ariane 5 is also currently deploying the Galileo satellite constellation, Europe’s navigation system. And in the coming years, NASA’s next-generation space telescope, James Webb, will ride to space with Ariane 5.

Ariane 6 will be able to extend the boundaries once again. Airbus Safran Launchers signed a €2.4-billion contract with the European Space Agency in August 2015 to develop the Ariane 62 and 64.

The two versions differ in the number of solid rocket boosters, which determine their reach. Ariane 62 has two P120 solid rocket boosters and will be able to lift up to 5,000 kg to geostationary orbit, whereas Ariane 64 will have four boosters, capable of delivering up to 10,500 kg. These rockets will carry the next generation of communication and Earth observation satellites, as well as scientific missions to the Moon, Mars and beyond.

Stronger together

Airbus Safran Launchers is the prime contractor for Ariane 5, but the launcher family is a truly collective European accomplishment. “European collaboration is fundamental: these rockets would have not been possible without it,” says Iranzo. “Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and many other countries have been involved. Each of them has developed its own experience and knowledge on certain products, which is absolutely essential for making successful launches,” he adds.

Expectations are high for the next chapter in the Ariane story. Ariane launchers have accumulated 232 launches since 1979, of which 221 were successful – a 95.25% success rate. This includes 75 consecutive missions without failure for Ariane 5.

Despite this outstanding record, every launch feels like the first one for everyone involved in its development, says German engineer Claudia Flöte, who has been working in France with Ariane launchers for nearly 10 years. “No matter where I am or what time it is, every time there is a new launch, I switch on my computer and follow it in real time,” she says. “It is a bond that grows stronger and stronger.”

Led on behalf of the European Union, these missions aim to support the efforts of the respective governments to strengthen their stability and to respond to the security issues faced by their populations.

Airbus Defence and Space teams have deployed C-band satcom systems between Europe and Somalia, Niger and Mali, as well as satellite-based mobile phone terminals to enable communications in Malian and Nigerien territories. The company is supplying the ground equipment, communications services and airtime.

Airbus Defence and Space has been providing satcom services for the EDA since 2012. Recently, the organization renewed its framework contract for the provision of satcom for another four years in order to meet the military and civilian requirements of the European missions. This new EU SatCom Market contract now encompasses X-band and UHF-band military satcom services, in addition to commercial C-, Ku-, Ka- and L-band satcom services.

The EU SatCom Market agreement allows EU member states to consolidate their requirements and purchase satellite communication capabilities in a coordinated manner, thus ensuring more economical and reliable access to satcom services, according to Airbus Defence and Space. Around 20 ministries of defense in Europe and EU organizations are taking part in this project, which allows them to equip themselves with satcom solutions and services across the globe.

“The EU SatCom Market project has successfully developed since 2009 as a solution for interested members states and EU entities to access better quality satellite communications services, under better economic conditions, with less burden. It is a perfect example of how EDA can combine its industry knowledge, technical expertise and experience in procurement to support EU operations/missions and member states in their procurement procedures and save scarce resources at no additional cost,” said Roland Van Reybroeck, director cooperation planning and support at the European Defense Agency."
A commuter’s dream: Entrepreneurs race to develop flying car - The Denver Post,"Mon, 06 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcnBvc3QuY29tLzIwMTcvMDIvMDYvYS1jb21tdXRlcnMtZHJlYW0tZW50cmVwcmVuZXVycy1yYWNlLXRvLWRldmVsb3AtZmx5aW5nLWNhci_SAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZW52ZXJwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDE3LzAyLzA2L2EtY29tbXV0ZXJzLWRyZWFtLWVudHJlcHJlbmV1cnMtcmFjZS10by1kZXZlbG9wLWZseWluZy1jYXIvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Joan Lowy, The Associated Press

WASHINGTON — Even before George Jetson entranced kids with his cartoon flying car, people dreamed of soaring above traffic congestion. Inventors and entrepreneurs have long tried and failed to make the dream a reality, but that may be changing.

Nearly a dozen companies around the globe, including some with deep pockets such as European aircraft maker Airbus, are competing to be the first to develop a new kind of aircraft that will enable commuters to glide above crowded roadways. A few of the aircraft under development are cars with wings that unfold for flight, but most aren’t cars at all. Typically they take off and land vertically like helicopters. Rather than a single, large main rotor, they have multiple small rotors. Each rotor is operated by a battery-powered electric motor instead of a conventional aircraft piston engine.

It’s no sure bet that flying-car dreams will turn into reality. There are many obstacles, including convincing regulators that the aircraft are safe, figuring out how to handle thousands of new low-flying aircraft over cities without collisions and developing batteries that will keep them aloft long enough to be useful.

But entrepreneurs are moving forward. They see a vast potential market for “air taxis” and personally owned small aircraft to transport people from the fringes of metropolitan areas to city centers as urban areas grow more congested and people spend more time stuck in traffic. They envision tens of thousands of one or two-person flying taxis delivering passengers to the rooftops of office buildings in city centers and other landing pads during rush hours.

“In as little as 10 years, products could be on the market that revolutionize urban travel for millions of people,” said Zach Lovering, the leader of Airbus’ project to develop an autonomous flying taxi called the Vahana. The name means the mount or vehicle of a Hindu deity.

Uber released a 98-page report in October making the business case for air taxis, which the company sees as the future of on-demand transportation. Uber doesn’t have any plans to develop a flying car itself, but the online transportation network is advising several companies that have aircraft in the works.

“The role we want to play is as a catalyst for the entire industry,” said Nikhil Goel, an Uber project manager for advanced programs.

Some of the aircraft are drones that will be preprogrammed for each flight and monitored or operated from the ground or a command center. Others are designed for human pilots.

It’s unclear yet how much the aircraft will cost, although prices are likely to vary significantly. Some of the aircraft are designed to be individually owned, while others are envisioned more for commercial use. Designers hope that if demand is high, prices can be kept affordable through economies of mass production.

Several recent developments could make these aircraft possible. Advances in computing power mean the rotors on multi-copter drones can be adjusted many times per second, making the aircraft easy to control. Drones have also benefited from advances in battery and electric motor technology. Some companies, like Chinese dronemaker EHang, are scaling-up drones so that they can carry people.

Another aircraft under development, Santa Cruz, Calif.-based Joby Aviation’s S2, looks more like a conventional plane except that there are 12 tiltrotors spread along the wings and tail. And some, like the Vahana, a cockpit mounted on a sled and flanked by propellers in front and back, don’t really look like any aircraft in the skies today.

“In terms of what you can make fly in a reliable manner, the solution speed gateway that (computer) chips have gone through recently have literally opened the door to a whole new world of flying machine possibilities,” said Charles Eastlake, an Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University professor emeritus of aerospace engineering.

But he also cautioned: “My best engineering guess is that people actually using autonomous air taxis in the next 10 or 15 years is possible, but definitely not certain. The challenges are big.”

Key for many of the designs will be the development of longer-lasting lightweight batteries. Currently available batteries could probably keep an air taxi aloft about 15 to 30 minutes before it would have to land, experts said. Depending on how fast the aircraft flies, that probably isn’t quite enough to transport passengers between nearby cities or across metropolitan areas, experts said.

Another hurdle will be winning Federal Aviation Administration certification for any radical new kind of aircraft when approval of even small changes in aviation technology can take years.

The FAA said in a statement that it is taking a “flexible, open-minded, and risk-based approach” to flying cars. FAA officials have discussed with several manufacturers the certification of aircraft that will be flown with a pilot in the beginning, and later converted to an autonomous passenger aircraft.

While further research is needed to ensure that autonomous aircraft are safe, “we believe automation technology already being prototyped in low-risk unmanned aircraft missions, when fully mature, could have a positive effect” on aviation safety,” the agency said.

Reducing noise is another challenge since air taxis will be taking off and landing in densely populated areas. So is creating enough landing pads to handle lots of aircraft at the same time. A new air traffic control system would also likely be needed.

“It’s pretty clear that the existing air traffic control system won’t scale to the kind of density at low altitudes that people are talking about,” said John Hansman, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who chairs the FAA’s research and engineering advisory committee.

NASA is developing an air traffic control system for small drones that perhaps could be expanded to include flying cars.

“There’s no question we can build the vehicle,” Hansman said. “The big challenge is whether we can build a vehicle that would be allowed to operate in the places where people want to use it.”"

Human space flight: from Spacelab to Orion - Airbus,"Sat, 18 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE3LTAyLWh1bWFuLXNwYWNlLWZsaWdodC1mcm9tLXNwYWNlbGFiLXRvLW9yaW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To the moon and beyond

European space science blasts off

One day, the Orion European Service Module built by Airbus will take humans to the Moon and beyond. It continues a legacy of pioneering technology that includes the ATV cargo transporters and the Spacelab and Columbus research modules.

In July 1973, while many people were talking about the new James Bond film Live and Let Die and the death of charismatic martial arts exponent Bruce Lee, Europe was looking to the sky. That month, during the second European Space Conference in Brussels, European ministers approved the Spacelab programme: a module for scientific missions to be mounted aboard the new US Space Shuttle.

The Spacelab platform was to be built by an industrial consortium headed by MBB-Erno, one of the predecessor firms of today’s Airbus. During that same meeting, the ministers also approved the founding of the European Space Agency (ESA).

This paved the way for the inception of Europe’s manned spaceflight programme, which ESA and Airbus worked on hand in hand from the very beginning.

Only a decade later, Spacelab, Europe’s first space laboratory, was placed in orbit on 28 November 1983. This was to be the first of 22 Spacelab missions involving cutting-edge scientific experiments in fields such as new materials, processing of pharmaceutical products and astronomical observation.

Columbus in orbit, 29 February 2016

The beginning of a great friendship

“Looking beyond that launch, let us endeavour to continue to work together in the same spirit of cooperation and mutual support that brought us together today.” These words, by NASA administrator James M. Beggs at the welcoming ceremony in the United States following Spacelab’s arrival from Europe in 1982, later proved to be prophetic.

Although Spacelab was retired in 1998, it was used as the blueprint for Columbus, the laboratory built by Airbus Defence and Space which is now the centrepiece of Europe’s contribution to the International Space Station (ISS).



""Let us endeavour to continue to work together in the same spirit of cooperation and mutual support that brought us together today""James M. Beggs, NASA administrator, 1982

A house for cutting-edge research

“Columbus is the first permanent European research facility in space,” explains electrical engineer Helmut Luttmann, Airbus Defence and Space’s head of ISS operation and exploitation.

Described by NASA as “a house for cutting-edge research”, since Columbus was docked to the station in 2008 it has been used to perform hundreds of experiments. These include ESA’s recent MARES tests to research the effects of weightlessness on the muscles of the human body.

Luttmann recalls major challenges his team has had to overcome, such as the time they changed the space station’s position in 2012 to record a complete rotation of the sun with the SOLAR instruments. It was the first time the ISS had been repositioned to perform a scientific experiment.

Sophisticated space freighter

Another memorable moment for Luttmann was the 2014 mission by ESA astronautAlexander Gerst, which required them to develop a facility to measure magnetic fields in only one year as part of the MAGVECTOR experiment.

“We took up the challenge, although normally it would have needed four years or more. Nonetheless, we did it and it worked right from the outset.”

Luttmann says the five Automated Transfer Vehicles (ATVs) used to ferry more than 31.5 tonnes of supplies to the ISS up until 2015 was also a major success for Airbus Defence and Space.

""With the ATVs, we became a full partner with NASA on major space programmes... The ATVs demonstrated our ability to dock automatically with the ISS, which is vital technology for future space exploration projects. We achieved this in Europe, without major support from NASA or Russia.” Helmut Luttmann, Airbus Defence and Space Head of ISS operation and exploitation



Humans in deep space

“Spacelab, Columbus and the ATVs have given us the capability to develop a highly reliable, top-quality system that will be crucial to the success of NASA’s exploration missions: the European Service Module of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle,” explains Luttmann.

The Orion capsule’s European Service Module is the first system-critical element to be entrusted by NASA to an international partner

NASA’s Orion capsule is designed to take humans to the Moon and beyond, with the ultimate aim of reaching an asteroid in lunar orbit around 2025 and Mars in the 2030s. Airbus is the prime contractor for the European Service Module (ESM). Located below the crew module, it will supply power, propulsion, thermal control, water and air for future manned deep-space missions.

Beyond the shoulder of Orion

The ESM is cylindrical in shape and about four metres in diameter and height. It is characterised by its four-wing solar array (19 metres across when unfurled) typical of the ATVs. The solar panels work on long-duration missions, meaning there is no need to worry about refilling fuel cell systems while travelling through space.

The ESM’s 8.6 tonnes of propellant will power one main engine and 32 smaller thrusters used to perform orbiting manoeuvres and altitude control. Once again, ESA will rely on the experience gained with the ATVs, which successfully used their thrusters to allow the ISS to dodge space debris

""The requirements for a mission to the Moon are completely different than for travel to the ISS in low Earth orbit. So, we have to change the design of the ATV by integrating, for example, one large main engine providing enough power to go to the Moon and back. For the time being, we will use refurbished engines from the shuttle programme."" Oliver Juckenhöfel, Airbus Defence an Space Head of orbit services and exploration

In 2018, the Orion capsule will perform an unmanned mission known as Exploration Mission-1, with the aim of travelling 64,000 kilometres beyond the Moon to demonstrate the spacecraft’s performance.

The first manned mission, Exploration Mission-2, is expected to launch four astronauts inside Orion in 2021 at the earliest.

“When that time comes, it will represent the culmination of the joint efforts heralded by NASA administrator James M. Beggs four decades earlier.

Europe takes off for space

Just as in 1973 with the historic approval of the Spacelab programme, the ESA Ministerial Council met in December 2016 to lay out the future of space for Europe. Based on the vision of a ‘United Space in Europe’, the Ministers committed to invest a total of €10.3 billion in space activities across 2017 and 2018.

This support will focus on numerous areas, including a second European Service Module for the Orion programme, as well as developing a habitat that could be launched with Orion to provide a larger living and working space in lunar orbit.

MacNeil left Airbus Helicopters’ Grand Prairie headquarters in his new helicopter after a final inspection and acceptance flight. This is the second Airbus model he has purchased. MacNeil already operates an Airbus H125, and he said his experience with that aircraft made the decision to buy a new Airbus product an easy one.

MacNeil met with the team of Airbus employees that had worked for months assembling, customizing, and installing the complex and intricate navigation and communications systems on the aircraft. “I’m excited to have this new helicopter, and I want to thank each of you for the dedication and quality workmanship you have put into it,” said MacNeil. “Having seen your commitment to producing an extraordinarily safe aircraft, I feel very comfortable flying associates, friends, and my family aboard it.”

The H145 provides a roomy cabin that can seat eight or more passengers. It features the Airbus Helicopters developed Helionix avionics system, including a standard four-axis digital automatic flight control system for reduced pilot workload and improved situational awareness.

A Fenestron enclosed tail rotor dramatically reduces noise levels. The Turbomeca Arriel 2E engines, with dual channel full authority digital engine control (FADEC), generate 951 shaft horsepower for take-off and allow improved hover and one-engine inoperative performance, as well as increased maximum gross weight capability.

MacNeil has built a highly successful automotive accessories business. His entire WeatherTech product line, which consists of floor liners, floor mats, cargo liners, side-window deflectors, car covers, license plate frames, mud flaps, pickup truck bed liners, BumpSteps and home/business doormats, is made in the United States.

Airbus Helicopters will showcase an H145 at Heli-Expo 2017, from March 7 to 9 in Dallas, Texas. Airbus Helicopters’ booth #7648 will exhibit several industry-leading aircraft models, a virtual reality experience demonstrating the cutting edge technology of the H160 helicopter that is under development.

An optimised method for the ground vibration testing of Airbus jetliners has reduced this validation phase for the A350 XWB’s stretched-fuselage A350-1000 version, and will now be used for the next new widebody aircraft: the A330neo (New Engine Option).Ground vibration testing is performed to measure the aircraft’s dynamic behaviour, confirming theoretical models of various flight conditions, such as manoeuvring, flying in gusty conditions and during landing touchdowns. In addition to being part of the “go” decision for a new jetliner taking to the skies for the first time, the test data helps clear an aircraft’s flight domain and is required for type certification by airworthiness authorities.As the A350-1000 is a derivative of the A350-900 (which underwent a ground vibration test programme for its own type certification, issued last November), a multifunctional Airbus Commercial Aircraft team was set up to shorten and simplify the process.The A350-1000’s testing was performed over a two-day period, compared to nine days for the A350-900, and the more than one month required for previous Airbus jetliners. “We brought together people from different domains,” explained Nicolas Lastère, a Flight Physics engineer in the Loads and Aeroelastics department at Airbus Commercial Aircraft. “The feedback and our results are a clear demonstration that different functions can work well together.”Based on the streamlined ground vibration testing’s success for the A350-1000, the method will now also be used for the A330neo – which is scheduled to perform its initial take-off in the first half of 2017."

A company that provides air traffic management for drones just raised money from Microsoft and Airbus - Vox.com,"Thu, 23 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vMjAxNy8yLzIzLzE0NzEzNTM0L2Fpcm1hcC1haXItdHJhZmZpYy1jb250cm9sLWRyb25lcy1yYWlzZWQtbW9uZXktbWljcm9zb2Z0LWFpcmJ1cy1zb2550gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"One of the biggest problems that still needs to be figured out before most people’s Amazon orders are delivered by a drone is managing how aircraft will coordinate and communicate with other drones and humans on the ground.

In other words, air traffic control for drones.

One company, AirMap, a drone mapping and alert platform, has made some serious strides. The company announced today it raised $26 million from Microsoft, Airbus, Qualcomm, Yuneec and Sony. Microsoft led the Series B funding round.

NASA and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration are in the midst of a multiyear research project on safely integrating drone air traffic control into the national airspace. That research isn’t slated to be finished until least 2019.

AirMap, in the meantime, has rolled out a system that alerts air traffic controllers and other drone operators where unmanned aircraft are flying and for drone pilots to report flight plans. It is already in use at nearly every major airport across the country.

Eighty percent of the world’s drones — including aircraft made by DJI (the world’s largest drone maker), Yuneec and Intel — are using AirMap’s services for things like preventing drones from entering protected airspace, like near airports.

Drones flying out of line of sight from the operator need to be able to ensure that they won’t hit other drones or collide with buildings, and they’ll also need a way to know which areas to avoid and when, like if there’s a fire the drone shouldn’t fly into.

That is, drones need to share and receive real-time information with other drones, as well as operators and local authorities on the ground — especially considering how unmanned aircraft can land and take off anywhere, unlike airplanes.

Another difference between drones and manned aircraft is that, increasingly, drones will be flying themselves.

“The drones of today are primarily piloted,” said AirMap CEO Ben Marcus. “But the drones of tomorrow, the drones that will really deliver benefits to people in their daily lives, will be more and more autonomous.”

This reality is still years away. Drones in the U.S. won’t be allowed to fly without an operator watching until the FAA creates new rules that outline how that can be done safely and legally. But that timeline obviously wasn’t enough to dissuade major investors.

The FAA has said that the agency does not provide air traffic control services for low-altitude airspace, which is where drones are permitted to fly, and is looking for industry solutions. That’s where a company like AirMap might come in.

Did Singapore Airlines Just Kill the Airbus A380 Jumbo Jet? - The Motley Fool,"Wed, 15 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDE3LzAyLzE1L2RpZC1zaW5nYXBvcmUtYWlybGluZXMta2lsbC1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1qdW1iby1qZXQuYXNweNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Singapore Airlines' decision to order 20 777-9s represents another blow to Airbus' troubled A380 aircraft program.

Last week, Singapore Airlines picked Boeing (BA -2.30%) over Airbus (EADSY -1.38%) for the next stage of its fleet renewal. It signed a letter of intent for 20 777-9s and 19 787-10s, which should be converted to a firm order soon. Singapore Airlines will also have options for six more of each aircraft type.

Boeing's win is a loss for the Airbus A350 program. Singapore Airlines is the top customer for the popular A350-900 variant, with 67 firm orders, but it hasn't ordered the larger A350-1000. Now that the carrier has a 777X order on the books, it isn't likely to pursue the larger A350 model -- let alone having any interest in a proposed stretch of the A350-1000.

However, at least one analyst thinks that the order for 20 Boeing 777-9s could also be a death blow for Airbus' A380 jumbo jet. Let's see if there's any truth to this claim.

The A380 is running out of orders

The A380 jumbo jet program certainly isn't doing well. Orders have slowed to a crawl in the past few years, forcing Airbus to reduce production by more than half. Indeed, Airbus has just 110 firm orders left for the A380.

In theory, that represents nine years of production at the new planned production rate of 12 per year. In reality, the situation is much worse than that. As many as 47 of the remaining orders are likely to fall through. These include 20 A380s ordered by aircraft lessor Amedeo -- which hasn't been able to line up a single customer despite years of trying -- and eight A380s ordered by Qantas that management has definitively said it does not want.

Of the other 63 outstanding A380 orders, 50 are for a single customer: Middle Eastern airline giant Emirates. Yet while Emirates has been a huge fan of the A380, Airbus' jumbo jet cannot survive with a single customer.

Singapore Airlines is an important A380 customer

That's where Singapore Airlines comes in. Singapore Airlines became the first airline to fly the A380 in 2007. Furthermore, it is the second-largest customer for the A380 -- albeit a distant second -- with 24 total orders.

Singapore Airlines still has five A380s on order with Airbus. However, the leases for its first five A380s are expiring soon. The first expiration will occur later this year, and the carrier has already announced that it will return the plane rather than renewing the lease. Most analysts expect Singapore Airlines to return the other four as well. That would keep its A380 fleet steady at 19 aircraft.

Singapore Airlines is one of the most highly regarded airlines in the world, so its fleet decisions can be influential among other carriers. As one of the first airlines to order the A380, Singapore Airlines paved the way for others to follow. If its new 777X order indicates that it is moving away from the A380, other airlines might follow its lead once again.

The A380 becomes less useful

The 777-9 isn't a direct replacement for the A380. Boeing says that it will hold 400-425 seats in a standard configuration, compared to 544 for the A380. (A real-world configuration for Singapore Airlines would have significantly fewer seats, though.)

However, Singapore Airlines has been struggling with steep fare declines in many of its markets recently, driven by slow economic growth and overcapacity. Many analysts expect this overcapacity -- and the resulting fare pressure -- to linger. In this environment, Singapore Airlines might be perfectly happy to move away from the enormous A380.

Last year, Boeing was rumored to be working on a slight stretch of the 777-9 that would boost its capacity by 30-40 seats. This would be even closer to the A380 in terms of seating capacity, with much lower unit costs -- giving carriers like Singapore Airlines even less reason to remain committed to the A380.

Can the A380 find a new market?

Singapore Airlines' 777X order confirms that yet another airline is becoming disillusioned with the A380. However, this had already been foreshadowed last year when the carrier announced that it would not renew its first A380 lease.

Singapore Airlines isn't the only A380 operator that likes to maintain a very young fleet. As these carriers remove mid-aged A380s from their fleets in the coming years, a large supply of cheap used A380s will hit the market.

This is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, these used planes may cannibalize some orders for new A380s from Airbus. On the other hand, bringing the cost down could encourage long-haul low-cost carriers and other smaller airlines to experiment with the A380. That could lead to orders later on, assuming that the A380 became a profitable tool for those carriers.

It's probably fair to say that the Airbus A380 is doomed as a hub-and-spoke airplane. Most A380 operators have already ordered the 777X, and they may find that those planes have plenty of capacity for their needs. However, the A380 still has an outside chance at survival if it can develop a completely new market among low-cost carriers looking to pack as many people as possible onto a single plane."

This article originally appeared on Quora.com in response to the question Can an Airbus A380 Fly Upside Down? and was written by Mark Hochstein, an airline pilot who's also a former fighter pilot and flight instructor.

I am assuming that when you say ""fly upside down"" you mean sustained inverted flight like an aerobatic airplane. The answer is flatly, no. Inverted flight requires a specific airfoil (wing shape) as well as specific lubrication systems for the engines. Transport category aircraft are not built to engage in inverted flight.

If, however, your question relates to the ability to fly inverted for only a few seconds, then I believe the answer would be yes. Any airworthy aircraft should be able to complete a 1G barrel roll at the hands of a well-trained pilot proficient in the maneuver. A properly executed 1G barrel roll will not over-stress the aircraft or affect lubrication in any way. The danger is that an improperly executed barrel roll can get out of control very quickly.

The master of this maneuver was Bob Hoover, who used to execute 1G barrel rolls in a twin-engine aircraft with one engine shut down WHILE pouring iced tea into a cup that was sitting up on the glareshield (dash) of the aircraft.

The Airbus, being a fly-by-wire aircraft, has limitations in place that would prohibit the execution of this maneuver, but with special procedures, these limiting system can be disabled."

Wednesday marks the 30 year anniversary of the Airbus A320’s first flight, where it departed from Toulouse, France on a successful 3 hour and 23-minute test flight on a misty day over Europe.

Pierre Baud, who captained the flight, said, “Our A320 is both delightfully responsive and reassuringly stable to fly, qualities which fly-by-wire brings together for the first time in an airliner.”

Today, Airbus has received just over 4,700 orders for the current engine option A320 type and has delivered approximately 4,100. In contrast, the A320neo has around 3,300 orders in total.

The design of the aircraft saw the introduction of the first fly-by-wire civilian airliner to take to the skies, and it wouldn’t be the last. Airbus was formed by a number of European companies looking to build airliners to compete with Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, and Lockheed in the aircraft market, creating direct competition for the Boeing 737 and MD80/90 series. Following the A300 and A310 program, the manufacturer looked to the development of a single aisle aircraft.

The program was launched in March 1984, where the launch customer airline Air Inter (later acquired by Air France in 1990) placed a firm order for 25 A320s with an option for 25 more at a later date.

The first significant order came from Northwest Airlines for 100 CFM56 equipped A320 aircraft in 1986. Today, the unit cost of a new A320 is approximately $99 million.

The first A320 aircraft rolled out of the final assembly line on Feb. 14, 1987, witnessed by then French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac and the Prince and Princess of Wales, Charles and Diana.

The aircraft then underwent a test program comprising of over 500 flights and 1,200 hours. Just over a year after its maiden flight, Air France received the first A320 airliner, with a 153 seat layout made up of 27 business class seats and 126 economy seats.

June 1988 saw the first A320 accident with a chartered Air France flight during the Hebsheim Airshow at Mulhouse-Hebsheim Airport. The flight was the first passenger flight of an A320 as well as the first public demonstration of the fly-by-wire system incorporated for the first time in a civilian airliner.

The specific cause of the crash brought about major controversy with claims of a cover-up by the investigators due to the nature of the flight. The flight had a planned fly-by over the airport in a low-speed, gear down configuration, at an altitude of 100 feet. Data revealed the aircraft actually flew 30 feet above the ground, skimmed over the top of the trees at the end of the runway and crashed into the nearby forest.

Although surviving the initial impact, three out of the 136 people onboard died while attempting to evacuate the aircraft. Today, a total of 31 A320 hull losses have been recorded.

The A320 has two variants: the A320-100 and A320-200 series. The A320-100 was the first to be produced, with only 21 versions rolling out before the A320-200 series was introduced. This newest version had a greater range and fuel capacity compared to the A320-100 and saw the introduction of the wing-tip fence.

While the aircraft is equipped with a single-bogie landing gear. Air India opted for its first 31 deliveries to be equipped with double-bogie main gear due to the poor runway conditions at many of the carrier’s airfields.

Aircraft today are delivered with either CFM-56 or IAE V2500 engines, capable of producing between 22,000-27,000 lb of thrust. The typical cruise speed for an A320 is Mach 0.78 (829km/h) but has a maximum speed of mach 0.82 (871km/h) and a range of around 3,200 nautical miles.

In terms of size, the aircraft has a wingspan of 36m (118 feet) and a sweepback of 25 degrees. The fuselage has a width of 3.95m (12.96 feet), of which the cabin is 3.7m (12.14 feet) wide, and a length of 37.5m (123 feet).

Equipped with fly-by-wire control systems, the aircraft also brought about the introduction of Flight Envelope Protection (FEP) to the flight crew. A feature that, initially, created difficulties for flight crew to understand. The aircraft operates one of three potential control laws: Normal Law, Alternate Law, and Direct Law.

Normal law means pilot manual inputs are directly transmitted to computers which un-alter the command and relay the input to the control surface actuator if operating within the flight envelope. An input of pitch to a certain attitude will see the aircraft hold the selected attitude should the pilot relax the control column, due to an auto-trim feature.

Deviation towards the boundaries are met with warnings and, if continued, sees the pilot demand disregarded if the input leads to an over-speed, over-bank, stall or an over-stress. To explain in a scenario, if a pilot applies full thrust and applies full nose-down input through the sidestick, not only will the aircraft limit the G-load of the pitch demanded by the pilot, but will also begin to increase the pitch should the aircraft reach its speed limit, a change in pitch that the pilot cannot override.

The second law available is Alternate Law, which operates should multiple system failures occur. The fundamental difference is the aircraft can be stalled. There is no bank angle protection and the yaw damper is lost. Repeating the previous scenario in this law, where the aircraft reaches its speed limit, the aircraft will begin to increase pitch to attempt to stop the acceleration, should the pilot apply full nose-down side stick input, the aircraft will obey at this time, and an overspeed situation can occur.

Multiple failures are required for Direct Law to become active. Pilot inputs are transmitted to the control surfaces unmodified and the control sensitivity depends on airspeed. There are no protections provided in this situation, just a few warnings. Should an aircraft be operating in Alternate Law, upon lowering the gear, the flight controls downgrade to Direct Law automatically if no autopilot is engaged.

Although it is not defined as a law, the last resort of controllability for the A320 is the mechanical backup. In this case, the only way to control the aircraft is by manually moving the trim wheel to move the horizontal stabilizer for pitch and asymmetric engine control for lateral control, or if no engines are available, rudder pedals. A DHL A300 crew were unlucky enough to find themselves in this scenario, after losing all hydraulics due to a ground-to-air missile strike in Iraq shortly after takeoff. The crew used asymmetric power from the engines and the trim wheel to land the aircraft. The rudder would not have been available due to the loss of hydraulics.

Nowadays anything related to the A320 is all about the neo (new engine option). A320neo aircraft are equipped with new engines, either CFM LEAP-1A or PW1100G, offering a fuel burn between 16%-20% less than the current engine options.

Its range will increase to 3,700nm and as part of the aerodynamic improvements, it is equipped with Sharklets. The first delivery of the A320neo occurred in January 2016 to Lufthansa, the first of a total of 3,300 A320neo orders. According to Airbus, the new airframe has a 95% resemblance to the current version, and because of this, has the ability to enter into an airline’s existing A320 fleet seamlessly.

The A320 continues to be one of the most popular aircraft in the sky, after Boeing’s 737. 30 years later, the airplane continues to modernize and shape single-aisle aircraft design.

The aircraft, leased from AerCap, was delivered during a ceremony held at the Airbus Delivery Centre in Toulouse on 28 February. It will take off at 14:00 heading for Paris Orly Sud before embarking on its first commercial flight to Pointe-à-Pitre and Fort-de-France on 2 March.

This A350-900 can accommodate 389 passengers in a three-class configuration, (18 in Business, 45 in Premium Economy and 326 in Economy). The exceptional comfort and quietness of the ‘Airspace by Airbus’ cabin, combined with its new lighting system – much appreciated by passengers for the way it reduces the effects of jet lag – strengthen the sense of wellbeing and relaxation on long-haul flights.

Air Caraïbes plans to operate its A350 XWB alongside the A330s it already has in service on its Paris French Caribbean routes.

The A350 XWB benefits from the latest technological and aerodynamic innovations offering an unprecedented level of operational efficiency while significantly cutting its environmental footprint. Its fuselage and wings are made of carbon fibre and it is powered by the new-generation Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines.

To date, orders for 821 A350 XWBs have been placed with Airbus by 44 customers around the world, making this one of the most successful programmes ever in the long-range aircraft segment.

Incorporating the superior levels of comfort and well-being offered by Airbus’ A350 XWB, Air Caraïbes’ initial A350-900 is configured in a three-class layout with 389 seats – comprising 18 in Premium Business, 45 in Premium Economy and 326 in the main cabin

Pontifications: Alaska’s A321neo test drive - Leeham News and Analysis,"Mon, 13 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNy8wMi8xMy9wb250aWZpY2F0aW9ucy1hbGFza2FzLWEzMjFuZW8tdGVzdC1kcml2ZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Feb. 13, 2017, © Leeham Co.: It was subtle, but it was there: Alaska Airlines will take the Airbus A321neo for a test drive.

This will happen via its new sibling, Virgin America, which has 10 A321neos on order. VA is an exclusive A320 operator. Alaska flies only Boeing 737s. The acquisition of VA by Alaska immediately raised questions whether Alaska will retain the Airbus fleet and orders or phase them out in favor of the 737.

Of more interest to partisans than to me, the question over the future of the Virgin America brand also became a top question.

Rescheduling deliveries

During the year-end earnings call last week, VP-CFO Brandon Pedersen volunteered, “At Virgin America, we’ll take some number of the A321neos Virgin was planning on but we’re working with the lessor on an arrangement where we don’t take all 10 that are scheduled to be delivered over the next two years. Virgin America will be the worldwide launch customer for those aircraft, which will be configured with 185 seats, and we’re very anxious to see how they perform.”

“The Airbus is a great airplane,” said Ben Minicucci, president and COO. “As you know, we love Boeings, we’re all Boeing and we’re proud of that, and we’re learning a lot about the Airbus. What I will tell you is where you put the Airbus. It’s one of the things we’ve done well. We’ve put the right airplane in the right market. The…320… is limited as [a] Trans-Con airplane. We think it is a better North to South airplane. So at least in the next five years, I think you’ll see [marketing] work with the ops team really to get these airplanes in the right markets to really maximize their potential. So, where the 321s go, whether they go Hawaii or Trans-Con, I think we’ll make the right decision for to maximize their potential.”

Proudly All Boeing—for now

During the Q&A, Dominic Gates of The Seattle Times asked a follow-up about the fleet plan.

“We have been proudly all Boeing for I don’t know how many years, 10, 15 years,” said CEO Brad Tilden. “We have ‘Proudly All Boeing’ on the front of every one of our airplanes. We’re really proud of that. Flying Boeing airplanes has been fantastic for this company. That flying a single aircraft type has been fantastic for this company. So, that’s fact one.

“Fact two is we bought Virgin America and they fly Airbus airplanes. So overnight we now are in the position where we fly both airplane types. All that we have said is that we’re going to go through a process in 2017 where we make a decision as to whether to continue to fly two airplane types, or whether to go back and fly a single airplane type again. And that process is going to take six, seven, eight, nine months, something like that. But we’re going to–as any company would–we’re going to go through the right process to make the right decision for everybody at Alaska and we’re going to certainly talk with Boeing and Airbus as we go through that process.”

Tilden said that the issue is pressing because the first A321neos are delivered this year. (Four this year, the first in May, and six next year, according to the Ascend data base.)

“We’re having conversations with…the lessor and Airbus about that airplane to see if we can sort of reduce that, because that’s a new airplane type to Virgin America. We’re having a conversation to see if we can sort of reduce that commitment to A321s or put that off a bit while we go through this process to make the right long-term decision for everyone. And that’s really all that we can say about where we are right now.”

The lessor is GECAS.

A321neo vs 737-9 vs 737-10

Alaska has 17 737-9s on order, just a fraction compared with the large fleet of 737-900s/ERs that one day must be replaced. The -900ERs are relative new, but Alaska was the launch customer for the original, standard 737-900. The standard -900 is, by flexible standards, a sub-par airplane. Field performance is poor and it can’t do US trans-con. These would be the first to go in a re-fleeting.

But the MAX 9 pales to the A321neo, which carries more passengers, has more range and has better field performance.

The prospective MAX 10 carriers slightly fewer passengers compared with the A321neo and has substantially less range—but it can do US trans-con.

If all Alaska wants is more seats, the MAX 10 would serve it well. But if range is needed, Alaska must choose the A321neo.

The A321’s wider cabin also provides more flexibility for premium services, such as JetBlue’s Mint, should Alaska choose this path.

Given Alaska’s continued expansion into longer haul markets and increasing competition in the premium cabin arena, the A321neo is the more flexible airplane.

It all comes down to where the airline will go for new markets and passenger experience.

One branding

Although of less interest to me, especially since I’ve never flown VA, is whether the VA brand is retained. I don’t think it will be.

In the US, multiple-branded mainline operations within one company have never succeeded. USAir/Metro, Continental/Continental Lite, Delta/Song and United/Ted were all flops. The secondary brands all disappeared into the primary ones.

Even at Alaska, in the end, multiple brands were eventually merged into the Alaska name: Jet America and even Horizon Air became Alaska eventually. So it will with Virgin America, I believe.

"RCAF bids goodbye to the Buffalo aircraft, welcomes new era with C-295W - AirMed and Rescue Magazine","Wed, 01 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcm1lZGFuZHJlc2N1ZS5jb20vbGF0ZXN0L2xvbmctcmVhZC9yY2FmLWJpZHMtZ29vZGJ5ZS1idWZmYWxvLWFpcmNyYWZ0LXdlbGNvbWVzLW5ldy1lcmEtYy0yOTV30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) is in the final throes of naming the first of its new fixed-wing search and rescue (SAR) 16-aircraft fleet and has invited the public…

In awarding a CA$2.4-billion contract to Airbus Defence and Space for 16 C295W planes, the Government of Canada last December brought to a close a 12-year odyssey searching for a replacement for the Royal Canadian Air Force’s ageing fleet of fixed-wing search and rescue (FWSAR) aircraft. The C295Ws will replace Canada’s six CC-115 Buffalo and 13 CC-130H Hercules planes currently tasked with FWSAR missions at five bases across the country. It is a long overdue replacement: the RCAF’s Buffaloes were first delivered in 1964, and some of the Hercules arrived in the same decade. Many in the fleet have operational lives approaching 50 years.

Under the contract, many of Canada’s top aerospace and defence firms will benefit. Engines will be manufactured by Pratt & Whitney Canada, electro-optical systems by L3 Wescam, and other mission systems by Lockheed Martin Canada. CAE, Canada’s training and simulator manufacturer, will design, develop, and manufacture the training solution, including simulators.

In-service support for the life of the programme will be provided by AirPro, a joint venture between Airbus Defence and Space and PAL Aerospace of St John’s, Newfoundland. The contract requires Airbus to provide 70-per-cent availability, so the RCAF can be sure to meet its SAR responsibility 24/7, 365 days a year. The RCAF will keep first-line maintenance and servicing, and Airbus will be responsible for all second and third-line maintenance. This will add an estimated $2.3 billion to the price tag over the life of the aircraft, which are to fly until 2043.

The first aircraft will be delivered and training is to begin in 2019. Construction of the new training centre in Comox, British Columbia, is expected to begin shortly. The final aircraft should be delivered in 2022."

Iran Awaits Series of Plane Deliveries by March - Financial Tribune,"Wed, 15 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jaWFsdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvZG9tZXN0aWMtZWNvbm9teS81OTY5OS9pcmFuLWF3YWl0cy1zZXJpZXMtb2YtcGxhbmUtZGVsaXZlcmllcy1ieS1tYXJjaNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Iran is expecting several newly-purchased planes to be delivered before a March 20 deadline, which marks the end of the current Iranian year.

Iranian airlines are expecting to reap what they have sown during more than a year of intense negotiations with global plane manufacturers, in the wake of the lifting of Iran’s nuclear sanctions in January 2016 as part of a historic deal with world powers the year before.

Iran Air CEO Farhad Parvaresh said his company will receive an Airbus A330 by February 23, marking the second delivery from 100 jetliners the state carrier has ordered from Airbus.

Parvaresh was quoted by the Ministry of Roads and Urban Development's news service as saying that he could not speak confidently about the precise date of the delivery considering the paperwork that remains to be done.

“Another A330 will also be added to Iran Air’s fleet by March 20,” he added.

Late January, Iran Air published the image of an Airbus A330, which was said to be parked in France’s Chateauroux-Centre “Marcel Dassault” Airport and painted in the flag carrier’s livery.

“Iran Air’s new A330 has been spotted … Awaits delivery!” read a tweet from Iran Air’s official handle. A background check of the A330 shows the plane was initially built for the Sao Paulo-based Avianca airline, which canceled its order before delivery. The delivered A321 was also sold to Iran after it was canceled by another buyer.

Iran Air received an Airbus A321, the first plane from the multibillion-dollar Airbus order, on January 12, to ease concerns over a transaction that many said was endangered amid prospects of increasing political tension between Iran and the US after Donald Trump took office as new American president.

Iran finalized the Airbus contract on December 22. It is worth $18-20 billion based on list prices though Parvaresh has been quoted as saying that the value of the contract would not exceed $10 billion. It covers 46 of the narrow-body A320 family that includes the A321 model, 38 long-haul A330s and 16 of Europe's newest long-range model, the A350.

In addition to the Airbus pact, Iran Air also signed a deal to purchase 80 from Boeing and is close to a deal to buy turboprop aircraft from Toulouse-based ATR.

""Boeing has announced that its Iran Air contract is worth $16.6 billion. However, considering the nature of our order and its choice possibilities, the purchase contract for 80 Boeing aircraft is worth about 50% of that amount,"" deputy roads and urban development minister, Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan, has been quoted as saying.

Nonetheless, as tensions with Iran increase under Donald Trump, the future of Boeing’s deal with Iran Air remains in limbo. Industry observers suggest Tehran could pull out of the Boeing deal if tensions continue to worsen.

ATR Deal Finalized

Minister of Roads and Urban Development Abbas Akhoundi said on Wednesday negotiations to secure the $400-million order with ATR has “reached the final stage”.

Mehr News Agency quoted him as saying that both sides are “exchanging documents”, without elaborating.

The flag carrier has been in talks with ATR for over a year to purchase 20 short-haul aircraft, with the option of adding 20 more in future.

“The contract will be finalized if we reach an agreement over the Canadian engines of the plane,” Fakhrieh-Kashan was earlier quoted as saying.

The deal has reportedly been held up due to uncertainty over licenses for engines made by a Canadian subsidiary of Pratt & Whitney, America's top military engine maker and supplier to the colossal F-35 fighter project. Pratt & Whitney is seen to be wary of the political risks of dealing with Iran, especially with the F-35 project at the center of Trump's criticism of aerospace firms for going over budget, Reuters reported.

Meanwhile, pictures of a new ATR-72 600 painted in the airline’s livery have been making the rounds in local media that expect the plane to be delivered soon.

According to Fakhrieh-Kashan, Iran expects three to four deliveries by March.

Kish Airlines to Receive Embraer Jets

CEO of Kish Airlines, Mohammad Taqi Jadidi, says the carrier expects delivery of four Embraer 195 jetliners by March 20.

“These planes are a new generation of [Embraer’s] light passenger planes with a 108-seat capacity. They have been made in 2008 and 2010,” IRNA quoted him as saying.

The E190 and E195 are stretched versions of the smaller E170 and E175. The new versions have different engines and larger wing, horizontal stabilizer and landing gear structures.

Late summer, representatives of the Brazilian planemaker, including Arjan Meijer, Embraer vice president; Stephan Hannemann, market manager for Middle East and Africa; and Nico Martiniello, airline manager at Embraer Commercial Aviation, paid a visit to Iran to market their regional aircraft in the untapped, yet competitive Iranian market for short-haul jets.

Embraer organized events from August 29 to 31, including an educational session and a conference. The company also operated two demonstration flights around Tehran using an Embraer E190 model, a double-engine regional plane.

E190 and E195 models are the rivals of the Bombardier CRJ-1000 and CS100, the Boeing 717-200 and 737-600, and the Airbus A318.

Jadidi said buying Embraer 195 was aimed at operating flights to local airports that are less developed and cannot handle heavy planes.

Kish Airlines’ second medium-range Airbus 321 aircraft was delivered mid-November, a month after the carrier received its first twin-engine narrow-body A321.

The airline also purchased two Airbus A320 aircraft back in March. The deliveries are part of the carrier’s plan to add 10 planes to its fleet.

In addition to the Airbus jetliners, the carrier has seven US-manufactured McDonnell Douglas planes and three Dutch-made medium-sized twin-turbofan Fokker 100 airliners.

Although state-run Iran Air remains the biggest beneficiary of Iran’s nuclear deal, other airlines are gradually stepping up efforts to renew their aging fleet.

Iran Aseman Airlines is set to lease seven Airbus A320neo models from an undisclosed Irish firm following the signing of a memorandum of understanding between Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization and the Irish Aviation Authority in Tehran last week.

According to a CAO statement issued after the signing ceremony, the cooperation agreement will see IAA extend technical expertise and assistance in the areas of flight operations management, airworthiness, and aircraft MRO to their Iranian counterparts.

Once ratified, it will also simplify the means by which Iranian carriers can lease aircraft from Irish lessors by improving Iran's air safety oversight procedures, Switzerland-based airline intelligence provider Ch-aviation reported.

Iran Aseman Airlines' fleet consists of three A320-200s, one A340-300, four ATR72-200s, two ATR72-500s, three B727-200s, one B727-200(F), two B737-400s, and 19 Fokker 100s."

The European Service Module, ESM, will provide propulsion, electrical power, water, and thermal control to the Orion spacecraft, which will one day house astronauts on missions to space.

Although details might potentially change between now and the actual launch, Orion is expected to go farther than any human has ever gone before. On its flight around the Moon it will travel up to 500,000 kilometers (310,000 miles) from our planet. No human has gone beyond 400,000 kilometers (250,000 miles).

Orion will fly back around the Moon and then back to Earth, with the round trip taking 20 days. This will be followed by a crewed mission in 2021 with four astronauts on board, which will be the first time since 1972 that humans have left low-Earth orbit. Upon reentry, the ESM will separate and burn up in the atmosphere, while the Orion capsule will splash down in the Pacific.

“We are excited to be a part of this historic mission and appreciate NASA’s trust in us to help extend humanity’s exploration farther afield into our Solar System,” ESA’s Director of Human Space Flight, Dave Parker, said in a statement last December when the collaboration on the second ESM was announced.

ANALYSIS: How A320 changed the world for commercial pilots - Flightglobal,"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYW5hbHlzaXMvYW5hbHlzaXMtaG93LWEzMjAtY2hhbmdlZC10aGUtd29ybGQtZm9yLWNvbW1lcmNpYWwtcGlsb3RzLzEyMjk3Ni5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As the world’s first digital fly-by-wire (FBW) airliner, Airbus Industrie’s A320 was positioned to bring commercial flying and flight management into the 21st century when it was rolled out in 1987.

The question at the time was: how was 21st century flying going to differ from the way it had been? The question now is: did Airbus get it right?

For Airbus, the A320 was more than just a FBW airliner. It was the still-young company’s debutante in the narrowbody marketplace. But above all – in the company’s strategic perspective – it was its first product in a planned family of FBW airliner types that would, as a result of their control technology, have very similar flying and control-system characteristics.

Nearly 10 years after the A320’s entry into service, by which time the type’s market acceptance was obvious, former Airbus president Roger Béteille admitted the decision to use FBW flight control was one of the most difficult he had ever made. He explained: “Perhaps we were too bold, but we had no choice. Either we were going to be first with new technologies or we could not expect to be in the market.""

Livery styles may have changed since 1987, but much of the original aircraft christened by UK royalty lives on

Airbus

From the pilot’s point of view, the fundamental change in the A320 was the addition of flight envelope protection (FEP), which all aviators hope – and most would like to believe – they will never need.

The most visible difference was the replacement of a control yoke with a sidestick. The stick has a relaxed central position such that, when released to it during manual flying, no roll or pitch input is demanded of the pilot.

Control inputs to the sidestick and to the power levers in manual flight are intuitive, even to pilots trained on a mechanically controlled aircraft, but initially it feels strange not to have to follow up a manually commanded pitch change with trim inputs. There are no trim switches, and the conventionally positioned pitch trim wheels on the centre console are not used in flight except as an emergency back-up pitch control system. Pitch change demanded manually via the sidestick is delivered by the elevators, and the act of centring the sidestick commands the stabilisers to trim to the selected flight profile.

In 1997, one of Flight International’s test pilots, Peter Henley, benefiting psychologically from the knowledge that the A320 series had been in successful service for nearly a decade, flight-tested the new A319. He had this to say about flying the aircraft manually: “The sidestick works in the conventional sense and produces a rate of aircraft response which feels right to a pilot accustomed to a conventional aircraft. A comforting feature of the system is that the apparent response to the control and the feel remain constant throughout the flight envelope.”

FEP as a concept was difficult, at first, for flightcrew to get their heads around. In the A320 (and all subsequent FBW Airbuses) it works like this: with its flight control computers selected to normal law, the pilot’s manual inputs, when the aircraft is flying within the flight envelope, are transmitted direct to the control surface actuators unaltered by the computers, so pilots get what they are asking for.

If, however, the pilot allows the aircraft to get close to the edges of the flight envelope, warnings are triggered. If it continues right to the edges, the aircraft will be prevented from stalling, overbanking, overspeeding or overstressing, no matter what the pilot input – or the lack of pilot input, if that happens to be the problem. The FEP also provides an automatic reaction to the effects of windshear.

Meanwhile Airbus’s long term plan – completely visible in the fleet today – is that all FBW Airbuses (that is all Airbus types except the A300 and A310 series) would have so much commonality in terms of human/machine interface and systems control philosophy that for a pilot trained on one of the types, cross-type qualification on the others would be achievable with minimal training time and cost, even across the widebody/narrowbody divide.

FBW as a technology was not a new idea in the early 1980s when the A320 was in gestation. The military had used it extensively, and Airbus’s Toulouse forebear Sud Aviation (later Aérospatiale) had installed analogue computer-driven FBW in Concorde, its supersonic joint venture with British Aircraft Corporation.

To put the Airbus FBW venture into the context of its era, only one other airliner manufacturer was actively considering FBW control. In the mid-1980s, Boeing had proposed a FBW-controlled narrowbody designated the 7J7. It was to be fitted with twin aft-fuselage-mounted unducted fan engines (“propfans”), and intended for service entry in 1992. However, problems with the propulsion technology ultimately defeated the manufacturers, and a propfan has still not been successfully developed.

Popularity of the A320 has been the payoff of an existential choice: be first with new technology or, likely, be out of the market

AirTeamImages

Boeing introduced FBW seven years after the A320’s service entry in its hugely successful 777 widebody, but the company’s direct narrowbody competitor for the A320, the perennially successful 737 series, is still selling well despite having conventional mechanical controls. The 737’s flight deck is just as highly automated as the A320’s in terms of its autopilot/autothrust and flight management system capabilities, but it does not have active flight envelope protection, just warnings and a stickshaker.

The question 30 years after the A320 series’ service entry is: did Airbus get it right? The market says yes, and so do the accident statistics (or lack of them). But have the original flight laws/software that defined the A320’s flying characteristics at service entry in 1988 had to be changed in the light of experience? Soon after entry into service the manufacturer added a low-energy warning to the system, but otherwise the simple answer seems to be no.

Certainly no fundamental changes have been needed, but there have been a few adjustments to take account of higher gross weight or aerodynamically modified versions – like engine nacelle changes. Airbus also admits blandly: “A rotation law has been implemented for better take-off performances. The crosswind landing is made easier thanks to a new decrab law.”

The cockpit in the latest versions looks remarkably similar to the original, but its capabilities have been updated like those of other airliner types over the past 30 years. These updates take account of the drift away from navigating by radio beacons toward global navigation satellite systems. For example, they include precision area navigation, required navigation performance, vertical navigation, autopilot-flown traffic alert and collision-avoidance manoeuvres, runway overrun warning and prevention systems, and electronic flightbags. The company says there have been no changes to its A320neo cockpit.

So, despite all the initial apprehension about the A320’s FBW/FEP systems, they have proved themselves to be remarkably durable.

Cockpit automation

Airbus Industrie’s ambition to design a flight control system that would help pilots do their job better and more safely than purely mechanically connected controls drove it, in the early 1980s, to conduct a fresh examination of how pilots’ roles were changing in the modern commercial aviation environment. The company concluded that pilots would definitely remain essential, that the cockpit design would reflect their primacy as decision-makers, but that also they would need more back-up in the age of highly automated cockpits, busier skies and an expectation of zero accident risk.

The new cockpit automation philosophy first launched in the A320-series anticipated an imminent era when pilots would hardly ever trip the autopilot out, and aircraft could rely largely on flight management systems for navigation, because their computational capabilities, speed and accuracy far exceeded the mental capacity of pilots. These things are taken for granted now, but then they were unfamiliar.

Autopilots combined with autothrottle had long been a useful pilot tool, but they work equally well with FBW or the old mechanical control systems. The latest variant of the venerable 737-series is a good case in point, and it still competes commercially with the A320 series.

There are times, however, when the autopilot – only capable of operating when the aircraft is within its flight envelope – is designed to trip out if it approaches the limits of its operating capability for whatever reason. This is the point where the pilots are expected to take over, using their flexibility, ingenuity and training to take charge of a situation that might be surprising, complex and confusing.

At this point, a glance at 1970s/1980s military control technology can aid understanding of the philosophy behind the extension of FBW capability to encompass FEP. In the 1980s there was direct cross-fertilisation of ideas between the computer-controlled dynamic (CCD) system of the Dassault Mirage 2000 fighter and the Airbus team, some of whom had flown it or military types like it.

CCD, which would now be called FBW with FEP embedded in the software, enabled a combat pilot bent on obtaining maximum performance from the aircraft to be able to demand it at any speed by moving the joystick and throttle on to the stops with no fear of overstress or damage. This liberated the pilot to concentrate on mission tactics, and enabled the airframe to be designed with “relaxed stability” without fear of loss of control, making the aircraft much more manoeuvrable.

FEP keeps the aircraft operating within safe parameters even if the pilot mishandles or neglects to control it, and the full authority digital engine control system does the same for the powerplants.

Airbus’s ultimate reason for moving into digital FBW was that it was now a sufficiently mature technology for use in the commercial arena, and the safety benefits of FEP were so obvious that it simply did not make sense not to use it.

Testing the prototype

In 1984, when Airbus Industrie was flight-testing its FBW system – some three years before the first A320 was rolled out – the manufacturer’s then senior vice-president for engineering, Bernard Ziegler, invited Flight International’s air transport editor David Learmount to take the controls of the FBW testbed A300B2. The aircraft carried the FBW flight computers linked to a single sidestick control that was mounted at the left-hand seat. The right-hand seat pilot had a conventional yoke with mechanical control runs.

Airbus named its A350 assembly line after A320 champion Roger Béteille, speaking

Airbus

In a short pre-flight briefing, Ziegler explained that, although the aircraft might feel as if it was acting in response to a direct connection between the sidestick and the elevators and ailerons, the relationship was more subtle. The spring-loaded sidestick, when relaxed to its central position, commanded – via the flight control computers – a 1g flight profile and a zero roll rate. When displaced in pitch the stick commanded a proportionate change in the vertical acceleration by operating the elevators, but the computers would limit the positive or negative acceleration to the maximum allowable g load if the stick was pushed or pulled on to its stops.

Ziegler explained that sideways stick displacement commanded a proportionate roll rate up to a maximum of 15°/s. And, he added, the system would not let the pilot stall the aircraft. He told his ingénue co-pilot he could try it when airborne.

In the testbed A300, the sidestick’s signals were sent to the computers which, in turn, sent signals that activated control surface servos according to the stick displacement and the flight laws embedded in the system software.

The purpose of this flight was to demonstrate the system’s FEP in action. Learmount took over the sidestick seat when the aircraft was at a safe altitude, Ziegler gave him control and invited him to try to stall the aircraft in clean configuration. The throttles were set to idle, and Learmount chose to let the aircraft slow down in level flight. When the indicated airspeed was approaching the stall at about 100kt (185km/h) the nose began to dip to maintain an angle of attack just above the stall. Learmount pulled the stick back to raise the nose and induce a stall, but the nose continued to dip and the airspeed continued – marginally – to reduce until it reached what Ziegler later explained was “alpha-floor”. This is the stalling angle of attack. At that point, with the stick still fully back on the stops, the engines wound up automatically to take-off/go-around power. As the airspeed increased and the angle of attack was just clear of the stall, the nose began to rise steadily and the aircraft powered upwards out of its brief descent.

The FEP limits the angle of bank more simply: a pilot roll input on the stick simply stops being effective at a maximum of 67° bank. Overspeed protection is provided by raising the nose to keep the speed within flight envelope limits, even if there is nose-down pilot input.

Pilot mental appreciation of how the FBW laws work in practice seems to be just a matter of familiarity. Manual flying in the A320 series feels perfectly intuitive, so it should not matter whether the pilot thinks of a pitch-up displacement of the sidestick as a demand for a proportionate elevator deflection, or as a demand for a proportionate increase in vertical g (which is how the FBW system delivers it), because the effect is identical: the nose-up attitude increases as demanded by the pilot. Likewise, it should not matter whether a pilot displacing the sidestick to the left is demanding a proportionate aileron deflection or a proportionate rate of roll, as the effect is identical.

Having experience not only of developing Airbus’s cockpit automation philosophy but of introducing conventionally trained line pilots to it in the early days, experimental test pilot Etienne Tarnowski remembers how it felt persuading them that the A320 was not taking control away from the pilots and giving it to a computer.

Tarnowski says it was useful to provide them with analogies they were familiar with. Pilots do not complain that yaw dampers or turn co-ordination systems take control away from them, he suggests, but rather see them as assistants. FEP in pitch loading does not take control away from pilots hit by a storm downburst on final approach, but liberates them to pull fully back on the stick knowing it will provide absolute maximum aircraft climb performance without fear of stalling.

Most questions from trainees, says Tarnowski, were not about manual flying or the flight controls, but about getting the most from the flight management guidance computer via the autopilot, autothrust and flight management system: managing the automated systems and choosing the best autopilot modes for any particular phase of flight. This happens to be the same in highly automated cockpits that do not work with FBW/FEP.

Tarnowski believes there would have been an early days benefit for new A320 crews if Airbus had merged its design and training teams earlier in the design process, but says: “I am not convinced that an earlier merging of the test and training communities would have changed the design of the A320.” It would probably have helped the instructors, however.
