Focus on: how an aircraft is built - Airbus,"Wed, 16 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE4LTA1LWZvY3VzLW9uLWhvdy1hbi1haXJjcmFmdC1pcy1idWlsdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"From design through production and onward to final tests and certifications, each Airbus jetliner is the result of wide-ranging expertise, complex logistics, and multinational cooperation across thousands of employees, suppliers and partners.

Design offices and engineering centres

A Realistic Human Ergonomic Analysis development tool – which allows an operator to interact with an immersive full-scale 3D digital model – was used in the design of the A350 XWB.

Airbus’ principle of global cooperation is built upon a global network of regional design and engineering centres that contribute to the company’s full line-up of modern aircraft. The main design office at Airbus’ headquarters in Toulouse, France is joined by five additional design offices and engineering centres in Spain, the United Kingdom, Russia, and two sites in Germany.

Looking beyond Europe, Airbus opened its first North American design and engineering facility in 2002 in the heartland of the United States at Wichita, Kansas. This location was expanded in 2010 with a second engineering centre additionally housing a team of in-service repair engineers offering critical support for worldwide customers. Along the U.S. Gulf Coast is the Airbus Americas Engineering facility in Mobile, Alabama, where employees are responsible for various interior elements of Airbus’ widebody A330, A350 XWB and A380 jetliners.

Airbus opened its first North American design and engineering facility in 2002.

Production

The elements of an A330neo widebody jetliner start coming together at the final assembly line, or FAL, adjacent to Toulouse-Blagnac Airport in southwestern France.

To manage the steep and steady ramp-up of industrial activities and meet continued strong demand for its aircraft, Airbus co-locates key contributing functions such as engineering and procurement with its primary production facilities in Germany, France, the UK and Spain.

In Germany, the city of Hamburg focuses on structural assembly and outfitting of fuselage sections, final assembly of A320 Family aircraft, A380 major component assembly, as well as manufacturing and equipping the rear fuselage sections for the A330 and A350 XWB programmes. Employees in Bremen are responsible for the design and manufacture of high-lift systems for the wings on all Airbus aircraft. Vertical tails are produced at Stade, as are other carbon fibre-reinforced plastic components such as flaps for single-aisle A320 Family aircraft, and spoilers for the A330. All the electronic communications and cabin management systems needed by both crew and passengers are designed and produced at the Buxtehude site.

Employees in Toulouse, France – the headquarters of Airbus – are responsible for engineering, structure testing, flight tests, and more. The area around Toulouse-Blagnac Airport is home to a delivery centre for completed aircraft as well as final assembly lines for the A320, A330, A350 XWB and A380 jetliners. Toulouse Saint-Eloi is responsible for delivering equipped and tested pylons to the final assembly lines. The plant at Saint-Nazaire specialises in structural assembly, equipping and testing of front and central fuselage sections for the entire Airbus family. Nantes specialises in the manufacture and assembly of the centre wing boxes for all Airbus aircraft, and is a leader in creating carbon fibre-reinforced plastic structural parts.

The first A380 wing was removed from its main assembly jig at Airbus' factory in Broughton, North Wales (UK) on November 4, 2003.

Located in North Wales, UK, Airbus’ Broughton site assembles wings for the company’s entire family of commercial aircraft – more than 1,000 per year. The city of Filton focuses on engineering and research & technology groups for wing design, landing gear and fuel systems design and testing, and the manufacturing of various components.

The Airbus Getafe, Spain location specialises in aeronautical component engineering, design, production and assembly, utilising both metallics and advanced composite materials to manufacture airframe components for all Airbus aircraft. The Illescas site is a leader in manufacturing composite aeronautical components, mainly large-scale or complex shaped parts as the A350 XWB’s wing lower cover. Puerto Real, in the south of Spain, specialises in the automated assembly of movable surfaces (rudders and spars) for all Airbus jetliners and produces the horizontal tail boxes of the A350 XWB.

Airbus’ primary production facilities for commercial aircraft are in Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Spain.

Transport of major aircraft sections

A380 fuselage and wing sections are shipped to the final assembly facility in Toulouse, France by a surface transportation network that includes specially commissioned roll-on/roll-off ships.

A customised, in-house transportation system was developed by Airbus to solve the need to move large, pre-assembled sections of jetliners from their production locations to the final assembly lines. A fleet of five A300-600ST Super Transporters fly completed fuselage sections and wings between cities.

Based on the Airbus A300-600 aircraft, the A300-600STs were modified with a bulbous main-deck cargo cabin, earning them the nickname “Beluga,” after the arctic white whale with a similarly prominent forehead. The Super Transporter is able to carry a 47 metric tonne (103,616 lb) payload over a range of 1,667 km (900 nautical miles).

To meet its growing transport needs in support of the company’s production network, Airbus is introducing a new-generation airlifter, the BelugaXL, which is based on the A330-200, and is similarly modified with a bulging upper forward fuselage for an enlarged cargo area.

When Airbus began production of its double-deck A380, the superjumbo airliner’s size required its fuselage and wing sections to be shipped via a surface transportation network with specially-commissioned roll-on/roll-off ships to the Toulouse final assembly line. Most A380 sections are transported to Toulouse by sea, river and road, while smaller components – such as the vertical fin produced in Stade or the nose section produced in Méaulte, France – are carried in Airbus’ Beluga fleet.

Final assembly

With its major structural components assembled, an Airbus A330neo begins to take shape at the final assembly line in France. In addition to housing a delivery centre for completed aircraft.

Expanding on its original final assembly lines, or FALs, in Toulouse and Hamburg, Airbus opened two additional FALs to better meet market demand: in Tianjin, China in 2008 – the first such facility for Airbus to be located outside of Europe; and in the United States at Mobile, Alabama, in 2015. Both Tianjin and Mobile perform final assembly of A320 Family aircraft – the most successful and versatile jetliner family ever.

Covering the product line of commercial aircraft, the full complement of Airbus jetliners is built in Toulouse: the A320 Family, A330 Family, A350 XWB, and A380. Hamburg has responsibility for the A318, A319, A320 and A321. Tianjin assembles A319s and A320s, while the newest FAL in Mobile, Alabama produces A319, A320 and A321 jetliners.

Test programme and certification

An A321neo passes through a purposely-inundated runway as part of a testing programme that includes the aircraft’s ability to safely handle a rejected take-off.

Before Airbus jetliners reach series production, the initial aircraft must first undergo a rigorous flight test and certification campaign. This campaign involves gruelling tests that include – among many others – maximum wing bending at limit load, fuselage pressure tests and fatigue tests, performance in both extreme hot and cold weather conditions, low speed takeoffs, rejected takeoffs and landings, engine water ingestion tests, among others.

To illustrate just one Airbus aircraft product line, testing and certification of A320neo jetliners involved six versions, three variants with two different engine options each: CFM International’s LEAP-1A and the Pratt & Whitney PurePower PW1100G-JM. The campaigns also confirmed these aircraft met the company’s performance targets in terms of fuel consumption and range.

The “Type Certificate” – issued to signify the airworthiness of an aircraft manufacturing design – is followed by the “Airworthiness Certificate,” which authorises aircraft operations in a certain countries or regions. Once approved and certified, the aircraft is cleared for service and full-scale production begins.

"Boeing, Airbus to lose $39 billion in contracts because of Trump sanctions on Iran - The Washington Post","Wed, 09 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXNoaW5ndG9ucG9zdC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvZWNvbm9teS9ib2VpbmctYWlyYnVzLXRvLWxvc2UtMzktYmlsbGlvbi1pbi1jb250cmFjdHMtYmVjYXVzZS1vZi10cnVtcC1zYW5jdGlvbnMtb24taXJhbi8yMDE4LzA1LzA4LzgyMGE4ZjA4LTUzMDgtMTFlOC1hNTUxLTViNjQ4YWJlMjllZl9zdG9yeS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing and Airbus will lose contracts worth roughly $39 billion to replenish Iran’s aging fleet of commercial planes as part of the Trump administration’s reimposition of sanctions. “The Boeing and Airbus licenses will be revoked,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told a group of reporters Tuesday. “The existing licenses will be revoked.”

The aircraft sales were among the most sought-after contracts for Iran.

In December 2016, Airbus signed a deal to supply national carrier Iran Air with 100 airplanes for around $19 billion at list prices. It has delivered three planes so far, the first new aircraft acquired by Iran in 23 years.

Boeing later inked a deal with Iran Air for 80 aircraft with a list price of about $17 billion, promising that deliveries would begin in 2017 and run until 2025.

The company separately struck a 30-airplane deal with Iran’s Aseman Airlines for $3 billion at list prices. No deliveries have been made yet.

Gordon Johndroe, a Boeing vice president, said in a statement: “We will consult with the U.S. Government on next steps. As we have throughout this process, we’ll continue to follow the U.S. Government’s lead.”

Analysts said the impact on Boeing would be modest because of a backlog of orders for 737 aircraft. Boeing’s stock fell 0.6 percent and closed at $338.37 a share.

Airbus, based in Toulouse, France, is subject to U.S. export restrictions because more than 10 percent of its jet parts originate with U.S. companies such as United Technologies, Rockwell Collins and General Electric.

Mnuchin also said the Trump administration would cancel waivers that allowed the sale of commercial aircraft parts and services.

“These sanctions do impact all of the major industries,” he added. “These are very, very strong sanctions; they worked last time. That’s why Iran came to the table.”

He said there might be some exclusions, but he did not elaborate.

One company hoping for a reprieve is the French oil giant Total, which last year signed a $2 billion contract to develop the South Pars natural gas field. The company said it hoped the deal would be left alone since it was signed according to rules in place at the time.

The administration said it was giving most international companies 90-day and 180-day “wind-down periods” to exit contracts and ventures in Iran.

The sanctions on oil purchases will be the same as under the Obama administration. The State Department will allow purchases by other countries if they show that they are making “significant reductions” over a 180-day period. Under Obama, and with the cooperation of five major economic powers, Iran’s oil exports fell by more than 1 million barrels a day.

The new sanctions might have less effect. Since the nuclear deal was signed and Iran was free to sell oil without restriction, the Islamic Republic has been able to make new sales of 700,000 barrels a day to Asia, led by China and India. It remains unclear how much those nations will comply, if at all.

Mnuchin said U.S. officials have had discussions with other countries about increasing production to offset the loss of oil from Iran. He did not say which countries, but Saudi Arabia has the greatest spare production capacity.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999691367149353}",neutral,0.999691367149353,0

Airbus Aerial Provides a Whole New View of the World - WIRED,"Thu, 03 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9haXJidXMtYWVyaWFsLWRyb25lcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"You may know Airbus as that Boeing competitor that also makes planes, but the European company is in fact an defense and aerospace giant that makes helicopters, satellites, and drones, and now it’s using its aircraft not just to move people, but to give those on the ground a whole new view from the skies.

A year-old effort called Airbus Aerial will seek to serve climate modelers, farmers, city planners, engineers, first responders, and anybody else who needs a a particular view of the world. The company combines data from observation satellites (of which Airbus is the largest global operator), manned planes with cameras slung underneath, and drones, to get to the places others can’t reach. Airbus Aerial packages it all up, and presents it neatly to the customer, via a cloud-based interface.

“It’s a very complex thing to just say ‘I need satellite data’,” says Jesse Kallman, president of the company. “You need to know which satellites, and the intricacies of acquisition and resolution.”

LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Drones

Say a utility company wants to take a closer look at remote power lines. Airbus aerial could start off pulling data from its two constellations of satellites, Spot and Pleiades. To include a closer look, it might contract with a local company to run a plane or drone flight over the area. Imagery in hand, it would mesh the macro and the micro, then send it off to the company. (This week at the AUVSI Xponential conference in Denver, it announced a partnership with DroneBase, an international network of professional drone pilots.)

After Hurricane Harvey devastated Houston in September, the young Airbus offshoot went to work. Insurance companies used the results for initial inspections of neighborhoods, to figure out which homes were totally destroyed, and process claims more quickly. Other customers have requested detailed images to check on the health of distant railway tracks, or oil and gas pipelines.

Airbus Aerial has also just started mapping the runways at Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson, the world’s busiest airport, a job that required clearance to fly in Class B airspace—the busy bits of sky that airlines use for landings and takeoffs. Airport officials had asked the company to survey the south runway, to see if drones could cut down on the time-consuming work of driving up and down the tarmac, checking for debris that could damage any aircraft, inspecting lighting, and checking signage.

For this job, the company used Sensefly’s eBee Plus fixed-wing drone, which flies autonomously at speeds between 25 and 68 miles per hour, capturing images of the ground below at a resolution of 1 centimeter per pixel. After the drone flies the length of the runway, the results are checked and compiled into a report for airport officials afterwards, including 3-D mapping to show bumps and cracks, and GPS data to locate things like busted lights. Meanwhile, the airport doesn’t have to pause flights to let some eyeball-using human drive back and forth.

Drones are poised to take on more projects like these, and make more of an impact in our lives. The FAA is due to announce within the next couple of weeks which five pilot projects, submitted by public agencies and private drone operators, it’s selected for trial runs. They’ll be given broad permissions to operate outside the existing rules, without requiring a time-consuming and difficult process of getting an FAA waiver every time they want to fly beyond a ground pilot’s visual line of sight, or at night, or over crowds. Airbus Aerial is involved with several of those proposals for similar mapping and inspection projects.

Companies are also jostling for the chance to make commercial deliveries, a vision Amazon first promised back in 2013. Instead of helping people shop, California-based Zipline wants to deliver blood to rural hospitals around Reno, Nevada—the same sort of thing it’s already doing in Rwanda.

The coming years will be about figuring out where drones can be useful, and where they’re just airborne pests. Airbus Aerial hopes that by combining its aerial data into the bigger picture, it can take off for the former.

The ruling could further strain trans-Atlantic trade relations, which have grown increasingly tense since President Trump vowed to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Europe and to sanction European companies doing business in Iran following his withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear accord.

“President Trump has been clear that we will use every available tool to ensure free and fair trade benefits American workers,” Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, said after the ruling. “Unless the E.U. finally takes action to stop breaking the rules and harming U.S. interests, the United States will have to move forward with countermeasures on E.U. products.”

A negotiated settlement remains possible, and the same appellate body that ruled Tuesday must still decide the other half of the dueling claims: allegations that the United States improperly subsidized Boeing.

Airbus and Boeing may have built their global success on the back of the transcontinental airliners but they are now eyeing a lucrative if rather less glamorous side of the aviation sector in their battle to dominate the skies—parts and repairs.

While booming demand for air travel across has seen the world's top plane makers ramp up production, it is the multi-billion-dollar after-sales service market that is taking an increasing amount of their attention.

The aircraft titans are aggressively expanding their presence in the sector, which is dominated by maintenance, repair and overhaul of aircraft but also covers other services, from training to parts supply.

The European and American firms have long done some business in after-sales support, but they are now moving to win greater market share and take on other players like Germany's Lufthansa Technik and US-based AAR.

""The services market is more lucrative than actual aircraft sales because it has more potential and it covers many different spectrums,"" said Shukor Yusof, an analyst with aviation research firm Endau Analytics in Malaysia.

""Boeing and Airbus—they have to be part of it. When you sell an aircraft, it's in your interest to have a full package of after-market services.""

Boeing predicts that the value of the approximately 41,000 planes that will be delivered worldwide over the next 20 years will be around $6 trillion—while the demand for services to support this fleet will be worth around $8.5 trillion.

The European and American firms have long done some business in after-sales support, but they are now moving to win greater market share and take on other players like Germany's Lufthansa Technik and US-based AAR

In Singapore, Airbus's wholly-owned subsidiary Satair Group has an 11,000 square metre (118,000 square foot) warehouse to house spare parts.

They are arranged on towering shelves in brown, yellow and orange boxes, and range from a main landing gear for an A380, the world's biggest passenger plane, worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, to a washer worth one cent.

They can be dispatched from the warehouse—Airbus's biggest such facility in Asia, and second-biggest in the world—within four hours of receiving an order, with plans to further slash the waiting time.

Airbus, whose revenues from services hit $3.2 billion in 2017, 18 percent higher than the previous year, plans to expand the facility by 8,000 square metres next year.

Both Airbus and Boeing also have major pilot training centres in Singapore.

Parts are arranged on towering shelves in brown, yellow and orange boxes, and range from a main landing gear for an A380, the world's biggest passenger plane, worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, to a washer worth one cent

'Very intense' fight

The fierce rivals play up their intimate knowledge of the aircraft they produce as an advantage in providing after-sales support over others who could provide the services, including the airlines themselves.

""We know best our aircraft because we have designed it,"" Airbus head of services Laurent Martinez told AFP.

""We have all the capabilities to support the airlines' operations and to have the competitive edge in terms of spare parts.""

Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said the US firm currently only has a seven percent market share in the sector, and there was plenty of room for growth.

""The products we have today can only address about 30 percent of this market,"" he said at the recent Singapore Airshow.

Airbus' Martinez said the Asia-Pacific is expected to account for 40 percent of the services market over the next two decades, with the region's aircraft fleet set to almost triple by 2036

""So if this market grows about five percent per year as we focus more on developing new products, we expect to see dramatic growth in our business.""

The Singapore Airshow highlighted the growing importance of the sector.

The largest deals at the show, the biggest in Asia, were not plane orders but contracts worth nearly $1 billion signed by Boeing's dedicated global services unit, which was launched last year as its vehicle to expand into the after-sales market.

Both companies are focusing on Asia-Pacific due to explosive growth of the aviation sector in an increasingly affluent region where many people are flying for the first time.

Airbus' Martinez said Asia-Pacific is expected to account for 40 percent of the services market over the next two decades, with the region's aircraft fleet set to almost triple by 2036.

The fight for after-sales services market share between Boeing and Airbus will likely be every bit as fierce as their battle for aircraft orders.

Competition ""is going to be very, very tough—very intense"", said analyst Shukor.

“Airbus Helicopters S.A.S. and Airbus S.E. have withdrawn their application for arbitration against the Republic of Poland submitted on the basis of the Polish-Dutch investment protection agreement,” the state office said in a statement.

However, the institution admits the European group did not waive its claims against Poland, which means that Airbus could still demand financial compensation for the canceled deal that was estimated to be worth about 13.5 billion zloty (U.S. $3.7 billion).

""In light of a recent change of regulation from the European Court of Justice, Airbus Helicopters has decided to withdraw its claim from the current European arbitration process. This is, however, a withdrawal without prejudice, meaning that Airbus Helicopters reserves all its rights and will now pursue its claims [before] Polish courts,"" said a representative with Airbus Helicopters in Poland.



In 2015, the Polish government selected the group’s offer to supply 50 H225M Caracal helos. Other contenders in the competition included Lockheed Martin’s subsidiary PZL Mielec, which makes the Black Hawk, and Leonardo offshoot PZL Swidnik, which produces the AW149.

Airbus Helicopters filed for arbitration after the deal was scrapped by the new Cabinet, and in October 2016, the Polish Ministry of Economic Development ended its negotiations on an offset deal with the producer.

In 2017, the Defence Ministry relaunched the helo tender and modified its scope to acquire combat search and rescue helicopters. Last September, the ministry said it obtained offers from Lockheed Martin’s Sikorsky and PZL Mielec, Airbus Helicopters, and Leonardo’s PZL Swidnik.

The pilot of Sichuan Airlines Flight 3U8633 managed to safely make an emergency landing in the Chinese city of Chengdu Monday, despite being exposed to freezing temperatures and extreme conditions, according to reports in Chinese media.

The co-pilot and one other crew member sustained minor injuries, but none of the 119 passengers was injured, Reuters reports.

The incident bears some similarities Southwest Airlines flight that made an emergency landing after the engine exploded and shattered a window – partially sucking out passenger Jennifer Riordan. The pilot safely landed the plane, but Riordan died of her injuries.

The plane was flying from Chongqing to the Tibetan city of Lhasa when the cockpit windshield shattered.

Liu Chuanjian, the pilot who managed to land the plane, told a local Chinese news outlet that there was no warning before the disaster.

“There was no warning sign. Suddenly, the windshield just cracked and made a loud bang,” he told the Chengdu Economic Daily, which was cited by Reuters. “The next thing I know, my co-pilot had been sucked halfway out of the window.”

The crew managed to pull the co-pilot back into the plane and he suffered only minor injuries.

One other crew member was injured, but all passengers on the plane emerged unscathed, according to local reports.

Airbus, which is investigating with local officials, has sold at least 1,500 A319 planes across the world, according to the Wall Street Journal.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9217976927757263}",neutral,0.9217976927757263,0

Airbus' Smooth-Flying H160 Helicopter Saves Pilots From Their Own Mistakes - WIRED,"Thu, 31 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9haXJidXMtaDE2MC1oZWxpY29wdGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In most helicopters, turning upside down is somewhat alarming, since it’s the sort of thing that usually precedes a crash. In the new Airbus Helicopters H160, though, it's a nonevent. Just a smooth upward pitch, followed by a nose-over onto the helicopter’s back. No shuddering vibrations, no crushing g-forces, no brick-like plummet. We simply turned over, leveled off, and then recovered.

Much of that smoothness comes from the skills of the pilot at the controls: Airbus experimental test pilot Olivier Gensse. But the nonchalance with which he flipped us over also stems from the inherent stability of the H160, a machine designed to save pilots from an array of life-threatening predicaments.

This helicopter is so smooth that Gensse didn’t even need the autopilot system, designed to help pilots (those who haven’t spent seven years helping develop and test this aircraft) recover from bad situations. In those cases—say, becoming disoriented during a storm, or avoiding another aircraft or a power line with a sudden, jerking movement—a quick double-tap of a button on the yoke will return the helicopter to a stable, controlled position, where pilots can regain their bearings. Called the “automatic recovery mode,"" it has existed in more basic forms in other Airbus helicopters, but this is the most advanced and capable yet.

“When you have margin, or the capability of maneuvering out of trouble, that makes you comfortable because you’re able to use the aircraft to its fullest,"" says Airbus test pilot Olivier Gensse. Airbus

Airbus made the H160, which will enter service next year, for everything from executive travel and oil-rig landings to emergency services. It can seat 12 passengers, fly up to 530 miles on a full tank, and hit a top speed of 177 mph. It burns 15 percent less fuel than aircraft equipped with previous-generation engines, and will cost in the double-digit millions. That’s competitive with other helicopters in its medium-duty class, but the European aviation giant hopes pilots and passengers will appreciate the innovative design.

The pitch-over demonstration, executed over the fields of western New Jersey during a demonstration flight for prospective buyers, was intended not to show how pilots might fly the H160, but to demonstrate the “margins” they have when things go sideways in the air. “I’m all about margins,” Gensse says. “When you have margin, or the capability of maneuvering out of trouble, that makes you comfortable because you’re able to use the aircraft to its fullest.”

Gensse also demonstrated the H160’s composure in the case of excessive inputs in an emergency, via another mildly terrifying move. He quickly increased the throttle and then just as quickly decreased it, with a violent jerking of the throttle for the dual 1,300-horsepower Safran Arrano turboshaft engines. This put us into a brief but controlled free fall, as the aircraft interpreted the pilot’s inputs and executed a rapid but still controlled and smooth response—whereas another helicopter could easily lose control during such erratic inputs.

“You can get out of critical situations very easily,” Gensse says, adding that the automatic pilot system—Airbus’s most advanced yet for helicopters—can help pilots focus on flying by managing many of the details relating to the power and flight control systems. The “glass cockpit” swaps analog dials for electronic displays, to help prioritize whatever’s most important at the moment. The high-visibility canopy, with minimal structural obstructions, is a further boon for situational awareness, and according to Gensse, eliminates the claustrophobic feeling that comes with many cockpits.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9971573352813721}",neutral,0.9971573352813721,0

Günter Scherer, renown for having been the German flight test engineer on board the A300’s first flight on 28th October 1972, passed away on 26th May 2018 in Toulouse. Günter Scherer was 85 years old.

A native from Duisburg, Germany, Günter Scherer had devoted his whole life to aviation and flight test. After graduating from RWTH Aachen with a degree in engineering he started his career in 1961 at what was VFW in Bremen at the time. In 1962, Günter Scherer was called onto the joint Franco-German military transport aircraft Transall. As such, he was one of the very first German flight test members to be graduated from the French flight test school EPNER (Ecole du Personnel Navigant d’Essais et de Réception) in 1961.

A convinced European, who believed in European cooperation as key for a successful aerospace industry in Europe, Günter Scherer joined the SNIAS French Aerospace Company, where he participated to the preliminary work for the Airbus aircraft flight tests. He was flight test engineer in the first ever Airbus flight on Oct 28, 1972 when the A300 took off.

In 1977, this allowed to establish the first integrated multinational flight test team, continuing the European integration which he strongly believed in. He was instrumental in the development and flight test of the A300, A310 and subsequently the first Fly by Wire controlled A320. He ended his career in February 1997.

During all his years at Airbus, Günter had been much appreciated by all his colleagues, who valued his human gentleness, directness and respect for others. Günter Scherer will be remembered by the Airbus community as a man of great integrity and a source of inspiration.

“Günter was a pioneer of Airbus, a strong advocate of Franco-German and European cooperation in our industry. He was thus a solid rock in the foundation of Airbus and will be long remembered,” said Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997250437736511}",neutral,0.9997250437736511,0

Airbus-built GRACE-FO satellites successfully launched from California - Airbus,"Wed, 23 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wNS1haXJidXMtYnVpbHQtZ3JhY2UtZm8tc2F0ZWxsaXRlcy1zdWNjZXNzZnVsbHktbGF1bmNoZWQtZnJvbdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Maps of Earth’s gravitational field will indicate movement of liquid water, ice and land masses

Vandenberg/California, 23/05/2018 – Yesterday evening (21:47 CEST), the twin GRACE-FO (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On) satellites, developed and built by Airbus, were successfully launched into Space from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, USA, using a Falcon 9 launcher. GRACE-FO is a joint project between NASA and the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) in Potsdam, near Berlin. Accurate measurements of the inter-satellite range between the two co-planar, low altitude polar orbiting twin satellites will allow the production of global and high-resolution models of the Earth's gravity field, offering details of how mass, in most cases water, is moving around the planet.



11 minutes after lift-off, the two Earth observation satellites, each weighing around 600 kilograms, separated from their dispenser structure, which was also built by Airbus to transport and hold the satellites during launch. A short time later, the GRACE-FO satellites ‘reported for duty’ via the McMurdo ground station in Antarctic. The mission is being operated from the space operations centre of the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany.



Once maneuvered into their operational orbits, both GRACE-FO research satellites will circle Earth in a polar orbit of around 490 kilometres, with a distance of 220 kilometres between them. The mission is planned to last at least five years. The satellites constantly measure the distance between each other to within a few microns using a microwave system built at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which manages the mission for NASA. At the same time, a sensitive accelerometer, built at ONERA in France, accounts for non-gravitational effects, such as atmospheric drag and solar radiation.



The data are being used to track the movement of liquid water, ice and land masses by creating monthly maps of the changes in Earth’s gravitational field. GRACE-FO will continue this essential climate record established by the predecessor GRACE mission (2002–2017), also a joint project between the United States and Germany.



The GRACE-FO satellites also feature a new inter-satellite laser ranging interferometer instrument, developed in a German/American joint venture, which is being tested for use in future generations of satellites. In addition, each satellite records up to 200 profiles per day of temperature distribution and water-vapour content in the atmosphere and the ionosphere to aid weather forecasting.

Airbus Will Suffer From President Trump's Iran Deal Exit - The Motley Fool,"Mon, 14 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDE4LzA1LzEzL2FpcmJ1cy13aWxsLXN1ZmZlci1mcm9tLXByZXNpZGVudC10cnVtcHMtaXJhbi1kZWFsLmFzcHjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With the U.S. imposing economic sanctions on Iran again, Airbus will have to remove dozens of valuable widebody orders from its backlog.

It didn't come as much of a shock last week when President Donald Trump pulled the plug on a 2015 agreement that eased economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits on Iran's nuclear enrichment program. After all, Trump had long characterized the agreement as a ""bad deal.""

The reimposition of U.S. sanctions throws a wrench into the plans of companies that had started doing business with Iran. Aerospace is one sector that will be hit particularly hard, as Iranian airlines had been desperate to upgrade and expand their fleets. However, the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran deal will hurt Airbus (EADSY -1.34%) a lot more than Boeing (BA -2.23%).

Boeing hasn't been counting on Iran

Two years ago, with the pace of aircraft orders slowing, Airbus and Boeing were eager to line up orders from Iranian airlines. Both companies signed big deals with Iran Air during 2016. Agreements with smaller Iranian airlines followed.

The deal that Boeing eventually struck with Iran Air called for the carrier to buy 80 aircraft, consisting of 50 737 MAX 8s, 15 777-300ERs, and 15 777-9s. In 2017, Iran Aseman Airlines signed a letter of intent for 30 737 MAX planes, bringing Boeing's total orders from Iran to 110 aircraft. However, Boeing never received licenses from the U.S. government that would allow it to export aircraft to Iran, and so it never included these deals in its firm order book.

Boeing doesn't need orders from Iran for the popular 737 family, which had 4,673 firm orders as of the end of April. (That's equivalent to roughly seven years of production.)

The potential 777 orders from Iran Air were far more valuable. Nevertheless, Boeing has been able to sell out its delivery slots for the next couple of years without relying on deliveries to Iran Air. Just last week, Boeing sold another four current-generation 777s to Lufthansa Group.

Airbus has a much bigger problem on its hands

Like Boeing, Airbus doesn't need the narrowbody orders it received from Iran. Indeed, the A320 family has an even bigger backlog than Boeing's 737 family. However, Airbus is in a much more precarious situation with respect to widebodies.

Iran Air ordered more than 50 widebodies from Airbus, all of which were included in the plane maker's firm order book. The carrier currently has outstanding orders for eight A330-200s, 28 A330-900neos, and 16 A350-1000s -- all of which will have to be canceled because Airbus planes use a high volume of American-made components.

Airbus can afford to lose the A350 orders, as that model has a substantial backlog. The same can't be said for the A330. Airbus only has one A330 order year to date, which has been offset by six cancellations. As a result, the company announced last month that it would cut A330 production to around 50 units in 2019, down from 60 this year.

Losing the 36 Iran Air orders will make this bad situation worse. The backlog for current-generation A330s will fall to 78 from 86 at the end of April, while the A330neo order book will fall from 214 units to just 186. More than a third of those remaining A330neo orders are for AirAsia X, which has been waffling on its long-term fleet plans, and another third are for aircraft lessors, which typically prefer to buy the most popular aircraft models. Thus, it is becoming more and more urgent for Airbus to shore up the A330 order book with new deals.

A missed opportunity versus a potential crisis

For Boeing, the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal represents a missed opportunity. If Boeing had been able to go ahead with its planned aircraft sales to Iran, it wouldn't have needed to cut 777 production as much as it has in the past year -- and it may have been able to ramp up output faster after the 777X introduction in 2020. However, the loss of this opportunity won't impact Boeing's results much relative to the status quo.

By contrast, Airbus desperately needed the A330 orders it had received from Iran Air. Without them, Airbus may be forced to offer even deeper discounts to rebuild its A330 order backlog and avoid further production cuts.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.7051886320114136}",negative,0.7051886320114136,-1

In the last 50 years, the aviation industry has cut fuel burn and CO2 emissions per seat / kilometre by more than 80%, NOx emissions by 90% and sound levels by 75%. Despite this impressive progress, society and the rapid growth rate in air traffic are placing increasing demands on the industry to seek further improvements.

According to the Airbus Global Market Forecast, 35,000 new aircraft will need to be built by 2036 to meet increasing demand in air travel. Air traffic is set to grow at 4.4% per year during this timeframe. The need to reduce aviation’s environmental impact is considerable – but so is its commitment to doing so.

As Europe’s leading aerospace company, Airbus has a major role to play. Enhancing scientific research and promoting international cooperation for sustainable development are a key part in the company's commitment to the UN Sustainability Goals.

Helping to meet these goals is the work Airbus carries out under Clean Sky, the EU’s multi-billion-euro research programme to develop innovative technology for sound reduction and lowering CO2 and gas emissions produced by aircraft. Airbus plays a major role in Clean Sky and is leading the development of several cutting-edge technology demonstrators that will help increase the sustainability of flight.

UltraFan: improving engine efficiency

In April 2018, Airbus announced a collaboration with Rolls-Royce to integrate the UltraFan demonstrator for flight testing, a project that will be co-funded by Clean Sky. A scalable jet engine design for widebody or single-aisle aircraft, UltraFan offers a 25% improvement in fuel efficiency over the first generation of Rolls-Royce Trent engine. Airbus will provide both nacelle hardware and engine/aircraft integration architecture and technology enablers in participation of ground and flight tests.

Airbus’ longstanding expertise in powerplant integration will be crucial in enabling the UltraFan to achieve this efficiency gain, as will the company’s capabilities in advanced production techniques such as additive manufacturing. The project will allow Airbus to fully integrate the engine onto the next generation of long-range aircraft, in addition to facilitating scalability for short-range aircraft.

Airbus’ “Flight Lab” BLADE demonstrator aircraft was showcased at the 2018 ILA Berlin Air Show.

BLADE: a new type of wing

Much has been done in recent years to reduce wing drag – and therefore reduce fuel consumption – from lengthening the wings to adding winglets. But the potential gains from this technology are reaching their limits. “That’s why we have to take a more radical step forward,” says Axel Flaig, Senior Vice President of Research and Technology at Airbus. “BLADE is that step.”

We anticipate a reduction in drag by up to 50%. This would cut fuel consumption and ultimately reduce emissions

- Axel Flaig, Senior Vice President of Research and Technology at Airbus

By modifying the shape, materials and surface of the wings, BLADE (Breakthrough Laminar Aircraft Demonstrator in Europe) represents an approach never used before in commercial aviation. “With technology now mature enough to use carbon fibre reinforced plastic, we anticipate a reduction in drag by up to 50%. This would cut fuel consumption and ultimately reduce emissions,” says Flaig.

BLADE is a key part of Clean Sky and Airbus heads a team of more than 20 partners on the project. The Airbus A340 Flight Lab BLADE demonstrator is the largest flight test demonstrator ever launched in Europe and has already logged more than 60 flight hours. Testing will continue into 2019, with a focus on analysing robustness. Flaig says the results could “open the door for industrialisation of this groundbreaking technology”.

Also in the framework of the Clean Sky research programme is the high-speed Racer (Rapid And Cost-Effective Rotorcraft) demonstrator which aims to bridge the gap between traditional helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. Optimising the trade-off between speed, payload, and range with agility in vertical flight, Racer will approach the mission capability of fixed-wing aircraft, yet also be able to take off and land vertically.

Racer features an innovative ‘box-wing’ design, optimised for aerodynamic efficiency, and an ‘eco mode’ will be tested to demonstrate an electrically powered ‘start and stop’ of one engine in flight, generating fuel savings and increasing range.

The increased speed and efficiency of the Racer technology will bring added value for a wide spectrum of missions, most notably emergency medical services and search and rescue operations, as well as public services, commercial air transport and private and business aviation. Final assembly of the helicopter demonstrator is expected to start in 2019, with a first flight the following year.

Sichuan Airlines co-pilot sucked halfway out of cockpit window - CNN,"Tue, 15 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAxOC8wNS8xNS9hc2lhL2NoaW5lc2UtYWlybGluZS1hY2NpZGVudC1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAUVodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDE4LzA1LzE1L2FzaWEvY2hpbmVzZS1haXJsaW5lLWFjY2lkZW50LWludGw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Beijing CNN —

A Sichuan Airlines co-pilot was sucked halfway out of an aircraft’s cockpit when its windshield shattered during a flight, Chinese state media has reported.

Captain Liu Chuanjian and his crew were praised for making an emergency landing after the incident, which occurred Monday morning at 30,000 feet on an Airbus A319 flight from the southern city of Chongqing to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet.

“The situation was very critical. The windshield was blown off at a 10,000-meter-high altitude. The aircraft was in a state of low pressure and a temperature was minus 30 to minus 40 degree Celsius,” Jiang Wenxue, a Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) official, was quoted as saying by state news agency Xinhua.

The co-pilot almost got sucked out of the cockpit but kept calm, according to Chinese state television station CCTV.

“There was no sign before the windshield burst. Just a huge noise,” Capt. Liu said, according to state news agency China News Service.

“When I looked at the other side, the co-pilot was partially blown out of the aircraft. Luckily, he had the belt buckled up. Many devices were malfunctioned and the plane was jolting strongly. It was very difficult to control,” he added.

The co-pilot suffered scratches and a sprained wrist, the CAA said, adding that a flight attendant was also injured. None of the plane’s 119 passengers were injured and the aircraft safely landed at Chengdu Shuangliu Airport in southern China.

However, passengers and crew described frightening scenes on board the plane during the incident.

“All people were shouting onboard. We just tried our best to reassure the passengers and make everyone believe us that we could touch down safely,” Zhou Yanwen, the injured flight attendant, was quoted as saying by China News Service.

“It happened as the flight attendants were serving our meals. People were shocked,” the agency quoted an unnamed passenger as saying.

Zhou said that some air stewardesses were thrown into air and that food was strewn about.

The windshield shattered over the southwest city of Chengdu about 80 minutes after flight 3U8633 took off at 6:27 a.m. local time (10:27 GMT), the CAA said in statement released by CCTV.

An investigation into the incident is underway.

Chinese people praised the pilot as an “epic hero” on social media, according to China News Service.

“The crew were level-headed and dealt with the crisis decisively and properly, avoiding a major disaster, which shows the superb technical skills and professionalism,” the CAA added.

The incident came nearly a month after the death of a woman who was partially sucked out of a window that broke during a Southwest Airlines flight over the United States.

Southwest passenger Jennifer Riordan died as a result of injuries she suffered in that April 17 flight. Something in the engine broke apart midair, and debris broke a window, passengers said, pulling part of Riordan’s body out as passengers tried to pull her back in. That incident is under investigation.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8927423357963562}",neutral,0.8927423357963562,0

JetBlue rolled out its newest special aircraft paint scheme Monday, unveiling an Airbus A320 painted in the colors of the Boston Celtics pro basketball team.

JetBlue became the “official airline of the Boston Celtics” back in 2016. The new special airplane ""livery"" is the latest in the partnership between the airline and the iconic NBA franchise.

JetBlue took the wraps off the Celtics-themed Airbus A320 at a Monday morning event at Boston Logan International Airport, where JetBlue and Celtics executives were joined by team mascot ""Lucky the Leprechaun."".

Dubbed “Lucky Blue,” the aircraft features “Celtics green” as the prominent color of the fuselage. Boston’s Lucky the Leprechaun shows on the tail fin as well as next to the JetBlue logo on each side of the plane.

“JetBlue and the Celtics play in the same backyard, and as the largest carrier in Boston, we want to support the teams that our neighbors are passionate about,” Marty St. George, JetBlue's executive vice president of commercial and planning, said in a statement. “This partnership is core to what it means to be a part of this great city and we’re excited to see this livery take our relationship to new heights – both literally and figuratively.”

“Celtics fans are everywhere, and it will be a special thrill for them to board this aircraft, sporting the iconic Celtics logo and colors,"" added Celtics Team President Rich Gotham.

The move comes as U.S. airlines have increasingly looked for local ties as a way to increase their visibility in important markets.

JetBlue has become the top carrier in Boston based on the number of destinations served. Still, it faces a competitive landscape there, especially from Delta, which has added numerous Boston routes that match JetBlue’s service during the past two years.

Allegiant Airlines, which began service at Destin-Fort Walton Beach Airport two years ago and recently added some new routes here, is now getting some new jets.

Allegiant added its first U.S.-produced Airbus A320 to its fleet this week. The airplane was assembled at the Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility in Mobile, Alabama. A team of Allegiant employees and executives from the company’s headquarters in Las Vegas joined Airbus’ leadership team recently at the plant for a ceremony to officially mark the delivery.

""It’s exciting to see the progress we’ve made in our transition to an all-Airbus fleet,” Maury Gallagher, Allegiant's president and CEO, said in the news release. “Operating a single fleet type will increase efficiency in teams across the company — including training, scheduling, and maintenance — while bringing economic benefits like greater fuel efficiency and additional seat capacity.""

The A320 comes in a number of versions, which can be configured to seat anywhere from 100 passengers to as many as 240 passengers.

Allegiant's latest Airbus acquisition is the 11th of 13 A320 jets scheduled for purchase directly from Airbus. Previously, Allegiant's A320s were assembled in Airbus facilities in Toulouse, France, and Hamburg, Germany.

The most recent Airbus delivery marks another step in Allegiant’s plan to transition to the Airbus A320 by the end of this year. Allegiant currently has 99 Airbus aircraft either in service or committed for future delivery, the release noted.

Bob Lekites, an executive vice president at Airbus Americas, said the company's ""partnership with Allegiant Air, coupled with our commitment to producing innovative aircraft, has allowed Allegiant to expand their ... flight options.

""We are proud to deliver Allegiant their first Airbus aircraft manufactured in Mobile,"" Lekites said in the release, ""and we look forward to providing them more aircraft. ...""

Allegiant's service at Destin-Fort Walton Beach Airport began with six routes in 2016 and jumped to 16 cities last year. The company’s latest growth, which includes some $50 million in investment at the airport, is anticipated to bring $418 million in tourism revenue to the region over the next five years.

The Okaloosa County Commission approved $1 million in bed tax-funded incentives last October to help Allegiant expand its operations at Destin-Fort Walton Beach Airport.

In February, Allegiant announced that it would establish a two-aircraft, year-round base at the airport, add five seasonal routes and provide more than 65 new jobs.

Beginning early next month, Allegiant's newest routes will provide service to Bentonville, Arkansas; Concord, North Carolina; Lexington, Kentucky; Evansville, Indiana; and Raleigh/Durham, North Carolina. The routes will operate twice weekly.

Beginning with one aircraft and one route in 1999, Allegiant has grown to more than 80 aircraft and 350 routes across the country, according to the news release.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.5231115221977234}",positive,0.5231115221977234,1

A dramatic aircraft collision on the ground at Turkey's Istanbul Ataturk Airport went viral among aviation circles after it was captured on camera.

In the video, the tail of a stationary Turkish Airbus Airbus A321 jet appears to get sheared off after being clipped by the wing of a taxiing Airbus A330 widebody jet Sunday.

Officials of Seoul-based Asiana tell The Korea Times the collision damaged the wing of the Asiana A330.

The newspaper reports:

""According to the ... airline and international media, the Asiana Airbus A330 heading for Incheon was taxiing on the runway of Istanbul Ataturk Airport before its starboard wing tip touched the Turkish A321's stabilizer. The collision resulted in a fire on the Turkish jet, forcing fire crews to rush to the scene.""

Video of the incident appears to have first been posted to YouTube by a user under the handle of “tunderboy.” The video had been viewed more than 278,000 times as of 7 p.m. ET on Monday. Additionally, a Turkish-language aviation-themed site also posted multiple photos showing damage to the Turkish plane following the incident.

Turkish Airlines confirmed the incident in a statement to FlightGlobal.com, adding no one was injured.

Citing images of the collision posted to social media, FlightGlobal identifies the Asiana A330’s registration number as HL7792 an the Turkish jet’s number as TC-JMM.

Plane collisions at busy airports are not uncommon, but they rarely result in incidents as dramatic as the one seen in Istanbul.

In the U.S., perhaps one of the most memorable recent incidents of the type came in 2011, when an Air France A380 superjumbo jet clipped the tail of a smaller Bombardier CRJ-700 regional jet operated by Delta Connection. The collision violently spun the CRJ, though no one was injured. (Video via YouTube).

Taxiing Aer Lingus Airbus A330 clips building at San Francisco

An Aer Lingus Airbus A330 was taken out of service Wednesday after its wing clipped a concrete wall as it was being towed to a gate at San Francisco International Airport.

No one was injured in the incident, but it did result in some damage to the aircraft.

The incident occurred around 3:15 p.m. local time, coming shortly after Aer Lingus Flight 147 had arrived to San Francisco from Dublin. Citing an airport spokesman, CBS affiliate KPIX reports that the jet “was being taxied in by a tractor into the terminal when the tractor crew misjudged the turn and the wing clipped a concrete pillar.”

The San Francisco Chronicle adds ""after the plane was towed to the gate, green paint from the plane’s wing tip was clearly visible on the concrete post.""

Aer Lingus confirmed the incident to the Irish Independent, saying that “a full investigation into the incident is underway.”

The carrier also canceled the jet’s scheduled return to Dublin that was supposed to operate as Aer Lingus Flight 146. “Aer Lingus apologizes for the inconvenience caused to impacted guests,” the airline said in its statement to the Independent.

Those who had arrived on Flight 147 ended up being stuck onboard the aircraft for about an hour after the plane clipped the airport building.

Maira Louise of Belfast, Ireland, was among those on the flight. She described the moment of impact to NBC Bay Area, saying: ""It was a bang, a good bang. Kinda made you go forward and back in your seat again … .”

By the end, though, she told NBC that most passengers were eager to get off the aircraft after the long flight from Ireland. “(E)eryone was shouting, can we get off can we get off?""

Pros

It is all about the cabin. Passengers get to travel in ultimate luxury and comfort. ACJs also depreciate well and have similar operating costs to large cabin business jets. The aircraft is extremely reliable but if you need maintenance pretty much every significant airport in the world has maintenance capability to work on an ACJ.

Cons

It costs a lot to buy and convert one – and conversion slots are limited. Historically operating one has been slightly more complicated (you have need to carry an engineer for daily checks) but this is changing.

The ACJ319 has a maximum range of 5,939nm, far enough to fly from New York to Doha, Hong Kong to Seattle or Los Angeles to Auckland non-stop.

A service ceiling of 41,000ft means the ACJ319 can’t fly above all bad weather – unsurprising due to its airframe shared with Airbus’s passenger jets – but its range allows it to fly round.

The take-off distance (1,850m) and landing distance mean that the ACJ canon fly into some smaller airfields.

A maximum operating speed of Mach 0.82 is respectable for a bizliner, and it ensures passengers get to their destination quickly – but you do not buy an ACJ for its speed.

Travelling

What you do buy an ACJ for is its cabin.

Measuring at 78ft 4in long, 12ft 1in wide and 7ft 4in high, the cabin is truly spacious and provides ample space for passengers.

A typical VIP configuration will seat around 8 passengers, according to Airbus. High-density cabins typically have capacity for 19 passengers.

Interior features can include showers, dining rooms, offices, a lounge and a master bedroom – all split into different cabin zones. High-end entertainment systems and wet galleys are also normal for such aircraft. However, this is all dependant on what the owner wants.

Like any bizliner, Airbus will deliver a ‘green’ aircraft to the customer, meaning the aircraft needs to go to a completion centre to get an interior designed and fitted.

Fitting an interior is not cheap, and refurbishing an ACJ319 will cost around $10-30 million (on top of the aircraft’s purchase price).

Owning

The ACJ319(CEO) was built between 1999 and 2015. ACJ aircraft follow the same production as Airbus’s commercial lineup and, as such, the new engine option (NEO) versions have replaced in their production. ACJs only take up a few production slots per year, so it is unlikely that the NEO variant will put downward pressure on the prices of older ACJs, at least for a while.

Some 74 ACJ319s were produced, making it the most-popular ACJ aircraft. The majority of these are based in Western Europe, Asia and the Middle East. This is unsurprising considering the status symbol that a VVIP aircraft would bring in these areas. These regions are the real focuses of the bizliner, with significantly fewer numbers of VVIP aircraft being registered within North America.

VVIP aircraft appeal to governments and heads of state due to their ability to carry guests, staffers and any equipment needed on a trip. The ACJ319 is no different, with the governments of the Ivory Coast, Italy, Slovakia, Malaysia and Turkey all owning the aircraft. Such aircraft will be equipped with a high-density cabin configuration.

Other ACJ319s are privately owned or are available to charter from Acropolis Aviation of Comlux. Charter prices for an ACJ319 are around $16,000 per hour.

An ACJ319 will cost $5,287 in variable costs per flight hour, assuming a fuel price of $4.30/gallon. Compare this to the G650ER and variable costs are only $1,401 more per hour. Although slightly more expensive, the ACJ allows you to fly further and carry more passengers.

Fixed costs including insurance, crew salaries, training and maintenance tracking will cost $718,526 per year. Flight-crew salaries make up $308,000 of this cost.

Airbus said on Tuesday it had taken steps to comply with a World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling on subsidies for its A350 and A380 jets, which has seen the United States and Europe trade legal blows on behalf of Boeing and Airbus.

The move comes after the United States won the right to seek sanctions against European Union goods following a partial victory in its 14-year legal battle against European government support for Airbus at the WTO.

The EU says it expects to strike a similar legal blow in a parallel case on U.S. support for Boeing later this year.

""Airbus and the European member states France, Germany, Spain and the U.K. have agreed on some amendments to A380 and A350XWB Reimbursable Launch Investment (RLI) loans,"" Airbus said in a statement.

""The terms of these amendments - like the terms of the original RLI contracts themselves - remain confidential but they are aligned with current market conditions,"" it added.

Airbus shares slipped 0.4 percent, slightly underperforming the broader Paris market.

The subsidies row coincides with transatlantic tensions over U.S. aluminium and steel tariffs, and the impact on European firms from Washington's decision to exit an Iran nuclear pact.

It is also part of a two-way battle between the EU and the United States over aircraft subsidies that could spark tit-for-tat reprisals between the two trade superpowers.

In a rare public face-off between senior strategists in the dispute, Boeing's chief external lawyer in the case told the BBC that the United States would be free to target any European products, not just aerospace.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9950242638587952}",neutral,0.9950242638587952,0

The Boeing 777, 767 and the Airbus A330, three of the most-used, two-engine widebody jets flying around out there look very similar to the untrained eye. But there are differences that help make them easy to distinguish.

First let's look at the largest, and most ubiquitous of the three, the Boeing 777.

Its most distinguishing feature is its size. This bird is a big one-- significantly larger than the 767 or A330. Its engines alone are enormous- some are as wide as the fuselage on a 737! A 777 is about as big as a 747 without the bubble top. (See slideshow at the top)

TravelSkills with Chris McGinnis sponsored by

Depending on configuration, the 777 carries around 375 passengers. Smaller 767s and A330s fall in the 250 passenger range.

But relative size is not always easy to determine when the plane is alone on a runway or in the air, so you must look for other features.

Another most distinguishing feature of a B777 is its flattened or bladed tail-- which is quite different from the conical shapes found on the back end of a 767 or A330. (The tail cones are also different on the newer A350 and B787 widebodies- see this Planespotting post about those two)

Advertisement Article continues below this ad

Plus, B777s don't have winglets, while all A330s and some 767s do.

You can also look at the outer edge of the cockpit windows. On Boeing jets, the windows have a sharp diagonal corner while Airbus windows are more square along the bottom edge.(See slideshow above for images)

Pilots, planespotters and aviation buffs can quickly recognize nearly every aircraft type from the ground or in the air.

But it's not so easy for the rest of us. To help TravelSkills readers confidently recognize what they see overhead or out on the runway, we offer a series of posts dedicated to planespotting.

And finally, look at the wheels- each of the main landing gears on a big Boeing 777 have three sets of wheels, while A330's and B767s only have two. (See slideshow at top for images)

Europe prefers Airbus A320neo over Boeing 737MAX – especially LCCs | CAPA - CAPA - Centre for Aviation,"Wed, 23 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vY2VudHJlZm9yYXZpYXRpb24uY29tL2FuYWx5c2lzL3JlcG9ydHMvZXVyb3BlLXByZWZlcnMtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjBuZW8tb3Zlci1ib2VpbmctNzM3bWF4LS1lc3BlY2lhbGx5LWxjY3MtNDE3OTE40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

Europe has more A320neos than 737MAXs in service and on order. It is the number two region for neos and number three for MAXs in service and on order.

Operators: Pegasus Airlines is Europe's biggest neo operator and Norwegian is Europe's biggest MAX operator.

Orders: Wizz Air has Europe's biggest neo order and Ryanair has Europe's biggest MAX order.

The A320neo is more popular than the MAX with LCCs globally, and especially in Europe.

Europe has more A320neos than 737MAXs in service

In Europe, and globally, the A320neo family is more popular than the 737MAX.

There are 65 A320neo family aircraft in service with 11 airlines (note that this does not include five neos in service with Airbus), compared with 18 737MAX aircraft in service with seven airlines.

A large majority of the neos in Europe are A320-200neos, of which there are 59 aircraft, while the other six are A321-200neos. The 18 MAX aircraft in service are all 737-8s.

Pegasus Airlines is Europe's biggest neo operator

The Turkish LCC Pegasus Airlines is the biggest current operator of neos, with 18 aircraft in service. Only Pegasus, SAS (12 aircraft) and Lufthansa (10) have a double digit number of neos currently.

In addition to Pegasus, other LCC operators of the neo are WOW air and Primera Air.

Norwegian is Europe's biggest MAX operator

Norwegian is the biggest MAX operator, with six of the type (through its Irish-registered NAI subsidiary, which uses them for trans-Atlantic operations).

The A320neo family has more orders than the 737MAX in Europe

While fleets in service are still small, the neo's greater popularity in Europe than the MAX is more evident in its superior order backlog.

Europe has 1,056 outstanding neo orders with 25 airlines, compared with 582 MAX orders with 18 airlines (these figures account for 96% of all A320 orders and 93% of all 737 orders in Europe).

The neo orders are fairly evenly split between A320 and A321 variants, although the smaller cabin version is slightly ahead, with 558 orders versus 498 for the A321neo.

A large majority of the MAX orders are for the 737-8 variant, accounting for 414 aircraft. There are 37 MAX-9 orders and 17 MAX-10 orders, in addition to 114 MAX orders with no specified variant.

Wizz Air has Europe's biggest neo order

Wizz Air has by far the biggest outstanding order for neos in Europe, with 256 aircraft awaiting delivery (of which 184 are A321-200neos and 72 are A320-200neos). Wizz Air's orders are an important part of its strategy to lower its unit costs - through larger A321 aircraft and through more cost efficient new generation aircraft.

Next is easyJet, with 124 neo orders (94 A320-200neos and 30 A321neo ACFs).

These airlines also have more than 50 orders: Turkish Airlines (92 orders, all A321neo ACF); Lufthansa (91 orders, 51 for A320-200neos and 41 for A321-200neos); Norwegian (88 orders, 58 A320-200neos and 30 A321neo LRs); and Pegasus (82 orders, 39 A320-200neos, 18 A321-200neos and 25 A321neo ACFs).

Norwegian plans to use its A321neoLRs for long haul routes, but is likely to sell or lease out its other A320 family aircraft as surplus to its own needs.

A further 10 European airlines have 10 or more orders for A320neo family aircraft (see chart below).

Europe: Airbus A320neo family aircraft on order at 16-May-2018

Ryanair has Europe's biggest MAX order

Ryanair is the biggest future 737MAX customer, with 135 outstanding orders that are all for the MAX-8, followed by Norwegian, which has 104 MAX-8 orders (in addition to its six already in service).

Turkish Airlines, also a leading customer of the A320neo family, has 75 MAX orders (65 for the -8 and 10 for the -9), and TUI Group has 68 on order (two for the -8 and 63 unspecified).

A further seven European airlines have 10 or more orders for 737MAX aircraft (see chart below).

Europe ranks highly for narrowbodies in service

Europe is the number two region globally for A320neo aircraft in service and the number three region for the 737MAX.

Asia Pacific is the leading region in both cases, while (perhaps not surprisingly) North America is ahead of Europe for MAX aircraft in service.

Globally, there are 290 neos in service versus 126 MAXs. There are more neos than MAXs in service in every region with significant numbers of either, apart from North America.

Europe also ranks highly for narrowbodies on order

Europe is also the number two region behind Asia Pacific for A320neo aircraft on order and the number three region behind Asia Pacific and North America for 737MAX orders.

Globally, there are 4,361 neos on order versus 3,356 MAXs. There are more neos than MAXs in service in Asia Pacific, Europe and Latin America, but the reverse is true in North America, Middle East and Africa (where order numbers are low).

Note that there are 1,665 A320neo orders and 1,582 737MAX orders with no specified region. This is either because the operating airline has not been disclosed, or because the orders are for lessors, with no operator yet identified.

The ratio of neo orders to MAX orders in Europe is 1.8 times, more than the global average of 1.3 times and second only to Latin America, where it is 2.2 times.

Airbus A320neo family and Boeing 737MAX orders by region at 16-May-2018

The A320neo is the more popular type with LCCs globally, and especially in Europe

Globally, the previous generations of the A320 family and the 737 have a similar level of popularity with LCCs.

There are 2,374 737NG/Classics in service with LCCs at 16-May-2018, representing 32% of the total, and 2,285 A320ceo family aircraft in LCC fleets, also 32% of the total.

However, among the new technology variants, the neo is currently much more popular than the MAX with LCCs. Globally, low cost airlines account for 46% of A320neos, but 31% of MAX aircraft (combining those in service with those on order) - similar to the LCC share of 737Classic/NG aircraft.

In Europe, LCCs are even more skewed towards the neo, in spite of their previous preference for 737NG/Classics over the A320ceo family.

Europe's LCCs operate 49% of the region's older 737 types, but account for only 30% of its A320ceos. LCCs have 42% of MAX aircraft (in service and on order) in Europe, which is a higher share than the global average, but less than their share of Classics & NGs.

LCCs' 56% share of A320neo family aircraft in Europe is higher than their share of MAXs and a significant step up from their 30% share of A320ceo types.

LCC share of A320 and 737 aircraft variants at 16-May-2018

For airlines that have not yet ordered, delivery slots will be distant

It is possible that the importance of Europe's LCCs in narrowbody order books, particularly for the A320 family, may be overstated.

For example, it may be that the LCCs are further ahead in the order cycle, and that full service airlines will catch up. Moreover, one or two mega-orders by LCCs such as Wizz Air and Norwegian serve to skew the figures.

Nevertheless, for those full service airlines wishing to get their hands on new generation aircraft that have not yet placed orders, delivery slots will be far into the future.

As oil prices rise (if they continue to do so), this hands greater advantage to LCCs over their higher cost competitors.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999037981033325}",neutral,0.9999037981033325,0

Components of the first ACJ320neo—the namesake of the ACJ320neo “Family,” which also includes the ACJ319neo—are already being manufactured across Europe and the company aims to begin final assembly of the bizliner in June.

The very first green example of the ACJ320neo has already been earmarked for UK air service firm Acropolis Aviation, which should take delivery of the jet in the fourth quarter of this year. Following that milestone, Airbus plans to squeeze in one more delivery before the end of the year. Next year, the first ACJ319neo will follow its siblings’ debuts, likely arriving to its new owner, German charter operator K5 Aviation, in the second quarter of 2019. In total, nine aircraft in the ACJ320neo family have already been sold: three 319s and six 320s.

The extra-wide-bodied ACJ320neo is one of the biggest private aircraft available, with a cabin that runs 91 feet in length and spans just over 12 feet. In a typical VIP configuration, it can seat as many as 25 passengers, who will be able to move about the cabin with ease thanks to a ceiling height of 7.4 feet. The jet can fly a whopping 6,897 miles at speeds of up to Mach .82 (about 614 mph).

The 320’s smaller sibling, the ACJ319neo seats up to eight in a VIP configuration. And while its cabin is shorter, it still retains the same cabin height and wide-body dimensions of the 320. It also has the same top speed, though it can fly significantly farther (7,767 miles) thanks to its lighter weight and greater fuel-storage capacity.

Given the size both models’ cabins, interior designers will have a huge canvas to work with. Aircraft completion company Comlux, which has already purchased 3 320s, has been planning for this launch for years, commissioning four notable aircraft interior designers to create over-the-top concepts for the company’s clients to choose from. Even Airbus itself has explored the interior possibilities of the new jet, creating the Melody concept highlighted in the gallery above.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999918937683105}",neutral,0.9999918937683105,0

Airbus Corporate Jets introduced the new Harmony interior design concept on Monday.

The Harmony cabin is designed for private jet variants of the Airbus A330neo and A350XWB wide-body airliners.

The interior features multiple VIP guest suites as well as a spacious central lounge.

Airbus Corporate Jets or ACJ debuted its new Harmony interior design concept on Monday. The new Harmony interior is designed for customers who order the private jet variants of the company's A330neo and A350XWB wide-body airliners.

""Harmony is a timeless and elegant design concept because we dare to break the conventions that are traditionally imposed on us as cabin designers,"" ACJ's head of creative design, Sylvain Mariat said in a statement. ""Our creativity needs to be unique to fit the needs of our customers, as befits a host receiving their guests in their 'world above the world.'""

And harmony is exactly what this interior tries to deliver. The central design motif found throughout the cabin are concentric circles that are meant to resemble ripples on a pond.

AirbusThe ACJ330neo and ACJ350XWB jets equipped with the Harmony interior will be treated to a master bedroom with attached office and bathroom. There are also four VIP guest suites — all with ensuite offices that can be converted into additional bedrooms. There's also a roomy lounge where passengers can meet.

Upon entry into the cabin, everyone is greeted by a holographic globe that pinpoints the plane's exact location.

The Airbus A330neo family carries a list price of $259.9 million for the Dash-800 and $296.4 for the larger Dash-900. While the A350XWB family ranges from $280.6 million for the Dash-800 up to $366.5 million for the Dash-1000.

VANCOUVER, Canada -- Lufthansa gave press an inside look at its Airbus A350-900 in early May, as the airline made this British Columbia city its latest destination to be served by the jet.

Lufthansa currently flies eight of the long-haul, widebody aircraft, with a total of 25 on order. The first was delivered in December 2016.

Lufthansa's A350 seats 293 in a three-class layout. Business class features 48 seats split into two cabins, each with a 2-2-2 configuration. There's also a self-service bar for those flying in business.

Lufthansa's premium economy cabin on the A350 features 21 international-style premium economy seats. Arrange in a 2-3-2 configuration, the seats look more like a domestic first class product, with a large recline and extra width.

Economy has 224 newly-designed seats in a 3-3-3 configuration, each with a large viewing screen.

One distinctive offering: Lufthansa passengers can use the airline’s “Companion App” to connect their phones or tablets to the plane's in-flight entertainment interface -- allowing customers to watch their own shows or listen to their own music at your seat.

Lufthansa has based its A350s mostly at its hub in Munch. The planes fly a number of routes for the German carrier, including a handful to North America. Aside from the new Vancouver service, Lufthansa's A350s also fly to Boston, Chicago O’Hare, Denver and Newark.

“The strategic placement of Lufthansa’s cutting-edge A350 aircraft on an increased number of North American routes, beginning with our summer travel season, emphasizes the level of commitment that the Lufthansa Group has towards the United States and Canada,” Tamur Goudarzi Pour, Lufthansa Group's Vice President for The Americas, said in a statement ahead of the first A350 flights to Vancouver. “It offers our passengers a premium product with elevated levels of comfort, including a more generous amount of space.”

ACJ debuts Harmony cabin concept for VIP widebodies - Airbus,"Mon, 28 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wNS1hY2otZGVidXRzLWhhcm1vbnktY2FiaW4tY29uY2VwdC1mb3ItdmlwLXdpZGVib2RpZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Provides productive practicality for the longest flights



Airbus Corporate Jets (ACJ) has created a new cabin design concept, called Harmony, which combines the comfort and space of a widebody cabin with the practicality to suit the longest of flights.

Harmony seamlessly combines the benefits of Airbus Corporate Jets’ VIP widebodies – such as comfort, space and quietness – to produce a consistently harmonious customer experience. It builds on the Airspace cabin brand from the Airbus airliner family.

Initially proposed for the new ACJ330neo Family[1], which features new-generation engines and Sharklets, Harmony can also suit other Airbus widebodies, such as the ACJ350 XWB.

“Long-haul flights provide time for productive work and socialising, as well as rest, and ACJ’s Harmony cabin concept is wonderfully well designed to enable all of these, while bringing the world within a single flight,” says ACJ President Benoit Defforge.

“Harmony is a timeless and elegant design concept, because we dare to break the conventions that are traditionally imposed on us as cabin designers. Our creativity needs to be unique to fit the needs of our customers, as befits a host receiving their guests in their ""world above the world,” says ACJ Head of Creative Design Sylvain Mariat.

A holographic globe, showing aircraft position, greets entering passengers. Turning left leads to the master bedroom, office and bathroom, while turning right brings travellers into a spacious lounge with seating grouped at round-tables that encourage social interaction.

Concentric circles, like ripples on a pond, are a feature of the cabin layout.

Just beyond the lounge is a conference table, and beyond that there are four VIP guest-suites – each featuring an office that converts to a bedroom, plus an ensuite bathroom with shower.

Seating for support staff and a galley make up the rear of the cabin, which can be adapted to serve both private and government customers.

Airbus aircraft have the distinction of being the world’s most modern and comprehensive family. All of the corporate jet versions have intercontinental capability, with some – such as the ACJ330neo and ACJ350 XWB Families – going beyond to deliver “nonstop to the world range.”

Airbus corporate jet customers benefit from airliner-reliability and a worldwide support network – sized to serve more than 10,000 aircraft and over 500 customers and operators – plus services tailored to their specific needs.

These services include the “one call handles all” corporate jet customer care centre (C4you), customised maintenance programmes and the ACJ Service Centre Network.

All of today’s Airbus aircraft include the protection and simplicity of fly-by-wire controls, the benefits of Category 3B autoland, and time and cost-saving centralised maintenance.

Collapse Of Iran Deal Hurts Airbus Much More Than Boeing - Live and Let's Fly,"Wed, 09 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWFuZGxldHNmbHkuY29tL2lyYW4tYWlyLW9yZGVyLWNhbmNlbGxhdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With U.S. President Donald Trump signing an executive order re-instating sanctions on Iran, Iran Air finds itself in a difficult position. So does Airbus. Boeing? Not so much.

The USA is withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal framework. With that withdrawal and reimposition of sanctions, plane deals worth $38BN from Airbus and Boeing to Iran Air are effectively cancelled. The Iranian flag carrier ordered 100 planes from Airbus, 80 from Boeing, and 20 from ATR, an Italian-Franco turboprop manufacturer.

The Trump Administration will revoke export licenses for aircraft, hitting not only Boeing, but Airbus as well since so many component parts are made in the USA.

This move greatly harms Airbus’ A330neo program, already facing weak demand. The loss of the Iran Air deal further threatens the viability of the program. Meanwhile, Boeing already announced last month that it had found alternate homes for Iran Air’s 777-300ERs, including three that were supposed to be delivered this year. Narrow body aircraft from both Airbus and Boeing are part of the order, but due to strong demand are not a concern.

ATR has already delivered eight aircraft and should be able to deliver two more prior to the reimposition of sanctions. ATR may find itself with unsold aircraft, though. The aircraft manufacturer has apparently started production on additional aircraft it will be unable to deliver within 90 days.

CONCLUSION

Looking at this from a consumer view, I’m very sorry that Iran Air will fail to receive these new aircraft. I was secretly hoping for the announcement of new nonstop 777-300ER Iran Air service from Tehran to Los Angeles (West Tehran). Oh well. For Airbus’ sake, I hope it can find other homes for its A330neo aircraft.

Airbus to offer H135 for U.S. Navy helicopter trainer replacement - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 17 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1cy1vZmZlci1oMTM1LXUtcy1uYXZ5LWhlbGljb3B0ZXItdHJhaW5lci1yZXBsYWNlbWVudC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters Inc. will offer the H135 helicopter as the solution for the U.S. Navy’s planned helicopter trainer replacement program. An H135 demonstrator aircraft in Navy trainer markings is on display this week at the 2018 Naval Helicopter Association Symposium in Norfolk, Virginia.

“The H135 is a market-leading, twin-engine, multi-mission helicopter performing the primary training mission for some of the finest militaries in the world,” said Chris Emerson, president of Airbus Helicopters Inc. and head of the North America Region.

Airbus Helicopters is a global leader in rotorcraft technology, offering a full range of modern and affordable training helicopters that have been proven in the U.S. and around the globe. The U.S. Army operates Airbus Helicopters’ twin-engine UH-72A Lakota as its initial entry rotary-wing trainer at Fort Rucker, Alabama.

“When paired with Airbus’s unrivaled support for the lifetime of the airframe, the H135 is the right solution both technically and economically for the U.S. Navy,” Emerson said. “As a twin-engine helicopter, the H135 provides a training environment most similar to the Navy’s warfighting rotorcraft fleet, creating opportunities for cost and operational synergies compared to a single engine trainer.”

The H135 is well-suited for military pilot training due to its maneuverability, high visibility, and low vibration levels. The aircraft is equipped with the advanced technologies, providing instructor pilots with an ideal platform for training missions for the U.S. Navy.

One of the safest aircraft in its class, the H135 is fitted with a glass cockpit, a crash-resistant fuel system, energy absorbing seats, fuselage and landing gear. The H135 has a proven record of unrivaled operational costs as result of continuous technological improvements. The H135 is a well-known military training helicopter, currently providing pilot training for military pilots in over 13 countries around the world.

Easily recognized by its trademarked Fenestron tail rotor system, the H135 combines Airbus Helicopters Helionix technologies, including an advanced cockpit with one of the most modern Human Machine Interface (HMI) available in this light multi-purpose helicopter class.

With an accumulation of more than 4.5 million flight hours, the H135’s operational training readiness has consistently averaged greater than 90 percent, further highlighting the platform’s viability for U.S. Navy pilot training.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9975804090499878}",positive,0.9975804090499878,1

MIAMI — An Air Astana Airbus A320-200 skidded off the runway during a windy approach at Astana International Airport.

The incident was captured by a passenger who was filming the heavy crosswind approach, as well as by an observer who was standing in front of the runway.

Air Astana’s flight KC352 departed Shymkent with 97 passengers and nine crew members.

As seen by the observer’s video, the plane approached Runway 22 with a dramatic crosswind angle.

Upon touching down, the aircraft abandoned the runway, crossing taxiways B and C, before returning to the runway’s centerline.

As seen in the video, the experience included heavy vibrations and terrified passengers.

According to AvHerald, there were no injuries reported.

However, the plane suffered damage to the number-one (left) engine inlet.

The Airbus A320-200 (P4-KBB • MSN 5613) was delivered to the airline in 2013 and is part of a fleet of other eight A320ceos and one A320neo.

Air Astana boasts a fleet of 31 planes, including Airbus A321, Boeing 757, 767, and Embraer E190.

The overall age of the airline’s fleet is averaging at 8.6 years.

Local reports confirm that thunderstorms with associated winds reached 49 knots of gusts. In the city, according to AvHerald, a building crane collapsed.

Following the incident, the plane was towed to the apron and all passengers disembarked.

Astana Airport was closed for 40 minutes following the incident.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7079002857208252}",neutral,0.7079002857208252,0

PBN editor-in-chief A. Kam Napier has more on how Hawaiian and Alaska Airlines approached their choices.

If you need an airliner, you really only have two choices, as far as manufacturers. There's Boeing, based in the United States, and Airbus, based in Europe but with manufacturing facilities in the U.S.

Two airlines with a big presence in the islands have recently been going through the process of acquiring aircraft and PBN wondered what goes into a business deal of this kind. Hawaiian Airlines made a big switch, canceling an order with Airbus to go with Boeing instead. Hawaiian's CEO, Peter Ingram, says, ""One of the challenges is you're buying an asset that is going to last 25 to 30 years.""

The airline felt that in the long run, the more popular Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner model would have a higher residual value than the Airbus A330neos. Hawaiian is acquiring 10 Dreamliners for $2.82 billion, the first of which will arrive in 2019.

Alaska Airlines decided to go for an all-Boeing fleet in 2005, a process that took until 2010 to complete. For that airline, cost was a factor. As with many purchases, the more you buy, the better deal you can negotiate. By keeping the cost of its planes down, Alaska had more room to then keep fares down, allowing them to be more flexible and competitive on ticket prices in the market.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9994046688079834}",neutral,0.9994046688079834,0

JetBlue Is Finally Ready to Refurbish Its Airbus A320 Fleet - Yahoo Finance,"Mon, 07 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9qZXRibHVlLWZpbmFsbHktcmVhZHktcmVmdXJiaXNoLWFpcmJ1cy0xMjE1MDA1NjEuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At a late 2014 investor day event, JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ: JBLU) unveiled a plan to boost its annual earnings by adding seats to each of its 130 Airbus (NASDAQOTH: EADSY) A320s. This ""cabin refresh"" project was designed to reduce unit costs while maintaining best-in-class legroom and adding new enhancements to the customer experience.

After a series of delays, JetBlue has finally completed the first A320 cabin retrofit. Last week, the carrier provided more details about its schedule for completing the project, as well as some design changes it is adopting. The cabin refresh will be a significant contributor to JetBlue's efforts to keep unit costs roughly flat over the next few years.

A moving target

Back in late 2014, when the cabin refresh plan was first introduced, JetBlue projected that the project would kick off during the third quarter of 2016 and finish before the end of 2018. Each Airbus A320 would see its seating capacity increased from 150 to 165 through a combination of a more efficient cabin layout and a modest reduction in legroom.

Since then, JetBlue has made several alterations to its initial plan. The first set of changes came in early 2016.

At that time, JetBlue announced that it would include its A321 fleet in the cabin refresh project, increasing seating capacity on each one from 190 to 200. It chose to prioritize these retrofits, completing them during the second half of 2016. This delayed the start of the A320 modifications until 2017. JetBlue also decided that it would only add 12 seats to each A320 in order to provide more galley space for its flight attendants.

By late 2016, JetBlue had scheduled the A320 retrofit program to begin in the fall of 2017. It had also lengthened the timeline for completing the project to three years in order to better align the modifications with scheduled maintenance events for its A320s. During 2017, it had to delay the retrofits again due to design flaws discovered with the lavatories installed on its A321s. However, it has finally gotten started on the A320 retrofits in 2018.

Story continues

Better late than never

Last week, JetBlue formally unveiled the first reconfigured Airbus A320. While the extra seats grab most of the headlines, the retrofits also provide lots of benefits for customers. These include mood lighting, power outlets at every seat, larger (and higher-quality) TV screens, and more TV channels.

JetBlue plans to reconfigure about a dozen A320s this year, with most of that work occurring in the fall. These planes will get the same seats and entertainment systems as JetBlue's A321s -- which receive higher customer satisfaction ratings than the current A320s.

In 2019, JetBlue plans to speed up the pace of retrofits so that it can complete the modifications within three years. It will also begin using a new, wider seat and an upgraded entertainment system.

The cost savings will be substantial -- eventually

In late 2016, JetBlue laid out a target of limiting non-fuel unit cost growth to a maximum of 1% annually from 2018 to 2020. That represents an ambitious goal given that JetBlue will likely face a substantial increase in pilot wages at some point during this period.

JetBlue is working through a $250 million-$300 million structural cost reduction program, which will provide the bulk of the savings needed to meet its target. Deliveries of new next-generation A320neos and A321neos from Airbus (starting next year) will drive additional savings.

The A320 reconfiguration project will significantly improve unit costs as well. For example, JetBlue will be able to spread its pilot, maintenance, and fuel costs over more seats. JetBlue estimates that this will ultimately increase its annual operating income by $100 million.

Based on the updated schedule for the A320 cabin refresh, JetBlue will see a negligible impact on its 2018 financial results. The savings will start to ramp up next year, and JetBlue is likely to achieve the biggest year-over-year benefit in 2020, with additional savings coming in 2021. This should enable the company to deliver solid earnings growth over the next few years.

""This delivery is also an important step in our transition to an all-Airbus fleet, increasing efficiencies across our entire operation, and bringing economic advantages in fuel savings, higher seat capacity and more.""

Bob Lekites, Executive Vice President of Customers for Airbus Americas, said the relationship between the two companies ""has allowed Allegiant to expand their ultra-low cost consumer flight options. We are proud to deliver Allegiant their first Airbus aircraft manufactured in Mobile, and we look forward to providing them more aircraft that exceed customer expectations.""

Earlier this year, Allegiant was the subject of a critical report by ""60 Minutes,"" charging that it had a record of excessive mechanical failures that raised safety concerns. Allegiant challenged the report, saying that it was based on outdated information about a fleet that was rapidly shifting from older McDonnell-Douglas jets to new Airbus A320s.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9921642541885376}",positive,0.9921642541885376,1

A solid indicator is the news that Airbus is selling its additive manufacturing research and development lab, APWorks, to aerostructures specialists and Tier 1 suppliers Premium Aerotec for an undisclosed sum.

Premium Aerotec was the first aviation supplier able to introduce 3D printed titanium components into the structure of aircraft, and states that it has ‘full capability’, covering the entire additive manufacturing process chain, from product conception to development, printing and the downstream process steps.

It’s an interesting move: There’s a lack of knowledge in the additive manufacturing world and as many organisations look to get into the game, for whatever reason, are trying to hire the best talent out there.

APWorks has developed a knack for showcasing both the potential for the processes, materials and clever design/engineering as well developing some interesting new materials – in particular, Scalmalloy (an Aluminium with a small amount of Scandium that gives it superpowers).

APWorks played a roll in the collaborative 3i-PRINT project

Why is Scalmalloy interesting? The answer is that while the composition of the material is protected, the addition of Scandium (and Magnesium) brings Aluminium’s properties much closer to Titanium-based alloys, presumably at a much lower cost and lighter weight.

There’s some interesting reading about the subject here, here and here.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8070915937423706}",positive,0.8070915937423706,1

China Investigates Shattered Windshield on Airbus Plane - Caixin Global,"Wed, 16 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhaXhpbmdsb2JhbC5jb20vMjAxOC0wNS0xNi9jaGluYS1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0ZXMtc2hhdHRlcmVkLXdpbmRzaGllbGQtb24tYWlyYnVzLXBsYW5lLTEwMTI1MDM1MS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Workers inspect a Sichuan Airlines aircraft that made an emergency landing in Chengdu after a cockpit windshield broke off. Photo: VCG

China’s aviation authority said the windshield that shattered during a Sichuan Airlines flight Monday, forcing an emergency landing, was the original equipment installed by Airbus and didn’t have any repair history before the failure.

The cockpit windshield on an Airbus A319 blew out Monday at 32,000 feet, causing a co-pilot to be partly sucked out of the plane. The flight eventually landed safely. The co-pilot and another crew member suffered minor injuries.

The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said the Airbus jetliner had been in service for less than seven years. According to the CAAC, the Sichuan Airlines plane hasn’t changed or repaired any of its original parts, which means a manufacturer fault couldn’t be ruled out.

The aviation regulator said it notified France’s Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety, known as the BEA. The French accident investigation agency and Airbus said they will send staff to China to aid in the investigation.

The accident probe will focus on the design, manufacture and construction era of the plane, said Tang Weibin, director-general of the CAAC's Office of Aviation Safety, at a news conference Tuesday.

A week ago, an Airbus plane operated by the U.S. budget airline JetBlue was forced to make an emergency landing in Florida when an outer windshield shattered in midflight. That airplane and Sichuan Airlines’ A319 both belong to Airbus’s top-selling A320 family of narrow-body, twin-engine commercial passenger jetliners.

Chen Jianguo, a senior airline pilot and commentator, told Caixin that it’s not unusual for an airplane’s windshield to crack during a flight. But incidents like the one involving the Sichuan Airlines plane — in which the windshield completely shattered — are rare, Chen said.

Chen said a windshield could crack for many reasons, such as striking birds, too much difference in air pressure between the cabin and the exterior, or aging glass.

In a 1990 incident, an improperly installed windshield on British Airways Flight 5390 broke from its frame, causing the captain to be blown partly out of the aircraft. Investigators found that when the windshield was installed 27 hours before the flight, maintenance technicians used the wrong bolts.

In the past month, U.S. domestic carrier Southwest Airlines had two incidents involving damaged windows. On April 17, a Southwest Airlines passenger was killed after an engine explosion caused a cabin window to shatter in midflight. That was the first passenger’s death in a U.S. commercial airline accident in more than nine years.

Another Southwest flight was forced to make an emergency landing in early May because of a cracked window. Southwest exclusively flies Boeing 737 twinjets.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9935309290885925}",neutral,0.9935309290885925,0

[Photo/VCG]

Airbus said it has assigned and dispatched a team of technicians to provide support to the Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety, or BEA, of France and the Civil Aviation Administration of China, which is leading the investigation of the reason behind the blowout of the front windshield of an Airbus A319 plane during its flight.

Sichuan Airlines Flight 3U8633 was flying from Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport of Chongqing municipality to Lhasa, Tibet autonomous region, on Monday morning. At around 7 am and 100 kilometers after it took off, the right cockpit windshield suddenly shattered and the aircraft abruptly lost altitude for five or six seconds.

The pilot was later able to make an emergency landing at Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport about 45 minutes after the incident, saving all 119 passengers and nine crew members aboard.

An investigative group set up by the CAAC had arrived earlier in Chengdu, Sichuan province, to look into the accident.

European aircraft manufacturer Airbus said in a statement that aircraft windshields are made of several layers of tough materials and are extremely hard to break. The one that blew out was original and had no record of problems or repairs, a preliminary investigation found.

The flight 3U8633 was operated by an A319-100 (MSN4660, registration B-6419). The aircraft was delivered to Sichuan Airlines in July 2011 and has to date accumulated some 19,942 flight hours, according to the statement.

Airbus will provide all necessary support to the CAAC and BEA on the investigation into the 3U8633 incident.

While the investigation is ongoing and in line with the Convention on International Civil Aviation Annex 13 regulation, Airbus refrains from any further comment on its progress, it said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9992654919624329}",neutral,0.9992654919624329,0

“Rarely has a team of this type worked in such intense publicity as the winners of this category. The kind of work they were doing inherently carries with it the risk of things going wrong – sometimes, indeed, dangerously wrong. It is routinely performed against the most pressing of schedules, but is highly reliant on weather conditions, the cooperation of numerous airports and regulatory authorities, and the correct performance of hundreds of supporting individuals,” indicated Flight International, explaining the selection. “Within two weeks of flying their aircraft for the first time ever, they took it to its maximum altitude and speed, and to the extremes of its maneuvering range. By the time they finished the program – on schedule – they had landed in 40 knots crosswinds and carried out accelerate-stop tests in a 575-ton aircraft from more than 300 kilometers per hour. In short, the program was a model of its kind.”

During the yearly Flight Award ceremony at the Pavillon d’Armenonville in Paris , on June 18, the representatives of the A380 Flight Test Team gratefully accepted the award. Claude Lelaie, senior vice president of Airbus’ Flight Division, said, “We accept this on behalf of the full A380 Flight Test and Engineering Team. We were only able to achieve this because of continuous and limitless efforts made by the team to make this the greatest aircraft, in all aspects. Our job was made easier by the excellent aircraft that we have had to bring to certification and maturity. From the very first flights, we recognized its remarkable aerodynamic excellence, its excellent handling characteristics and outstanding performance.”

Commenting on the award, Airbus president and CEO Louis Gallois, added: “It is an honor to be selected for this award by Flight’s own award committee, as Flight has an excellent reputation in the industry. It is important for the whole of Airbus that the efforts made by the A380 Flight Test Team are rewarded in such a way.”

The Airbus A380 has 173 firm orders and commitments from 14 customers worldwide and received joint EASA and FAA type certification in December 2006. Since its maiden flight in April 2005, the A380, with five development aircraft flying, has now made more than 1,100 flights and more than 3,700 flight hours.

Airbus is an EADS company.

The new JetBlue interior will feature wider seats, larger entertainment screens, and revamped mood lighting.

Economy class seat pitch falls from 34 inches to 32 inches.

JetBlue's fleet of Airbus A320 jets is getting a brand new interior. On Wednesday, the New York-based boutique carrier unveiled the all-new cabin design for its workhorse Airbus jet in nearly 20 years.

""JetBlue’s A320 restyling is about making the best even better,"" JetBlue executive vice president of commercial and planning, Marty St. George said in a statement. ""JetBlue has built its innovative reputation on offering our customers the very best products and a level of service they won’t find on another U.S. airline and this update ensures we remain the go-to choice for flyers who expect nothing but the best.""

The restyling will be done in two phases. From now until the end of 2018, planes updated during phase one will feature Rockwell Collins Pinnacle seats and a LiveTV 4 in-flight entertainment system which are already on the airline's larger Airbus A321s.

Phase two will start in 2019. Planes updated during this period will get ultra-slim Rockwell Collins Meridian seats, Thales Avant in-flight entertainment systems, and ViaSat 2 broadband internet connectivity.

JetBlue and its fleet of Airbus A320s were a major disruptive force when they arrived on the scene in 2000. The leather seats, abundant snacks, and free satellite TV in coach were a breath of fresh air. And the new interior promises to deliver even more.

But for travelers, the new Airbus interior is going to be both a blessing and a curse.

With the sleek new seats and bigger TV screens will also come a few sacrifices. For many, that will mean the loss of two inches in seat pitch. Seat pitch is the amount of room between two rows of seats. While that may not sound like much in the grand scheme of things, it's a big deal for airline passengers.

In its current layout, the airline's Airbus A320 fleet has 34 inches in economy or Core seats in JetBlue parlance. This makes the JetBlue A320 the roomiest economy class seat anywhere in the US. After the redesign, that figure drops to 32 inches. This allows JetBlue fit about a dozen more seats in the plane.

""After the restyling, we will continue to have the most legroom in coach (based on average seat pitch among U.S. airline), with 32 inches for Core seats and 35 inches for Even More Space seats in both phases,"" a JetBlue spokesman told Business Insider.

According to JetBlue, the ultra-thin design of the Phase two will actually deliver an extra inch of legroom in spite of the loss of seat pitch.

Thus, JetBlue will still be an industry leader in this category even after the update. However, bountiful seat pitch will no longer be the selling point that it once was.

Currently, American, Delta, United, and Alaska Airlines all hover around 31-32 inches of pitch. While Southwest varies from 31-33 inches. After the cabin updates, JetBlue Embraer E190, Airbus A320, and most of its A321 fleet will have 32 inches of pitch. The airline's fleet of A321s used for longer trans-continental routes have 33 inches in economy.

Trump said he would reimpose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran, which had been lifted under the agreement he has harshly criticized.

The pact, worked out by the United States, five other world powers and Iran, lifted sanctions in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program. It was designed to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb.

IranAir had ordered 200 passenger aircraft: 100 from Airbus SE, 80 from Boeing and 20 from Franco-Italian turboprop maker ATR. All the deals are dependent on U.S. licenses because of the heavy use of American parts in commercial planes.

Boeing agreed in December 2016 to sell 80 aircraft, worth $17 billion US at list prices, to IranAir under an agreement between Tehran and major world powers to reopen trade in exchange for curbs on Iran's nuclear activities.

The U.S. Treasury Department, which controls licensing of exports, said the United States will no longer allow the export of commercial passenger aircraft, parts and services to Iran after a 90-day period.

European planemaker Airbus said on Tuesday before the Mnuchin news conference that it would study Trump's decision, adding that it would take some time.

Trump pulls U.S. from Iran nuclear deal Duration 9:22 U.S. President Donald Trump has pulled America from the Iran nuclear deal, in a move to reinstate strict economic sanctions.

Following the 90-day period ending Aug. 6, the Treasury also said it would revoke a license that allowed U.S. companies to negotiate business deals with Iran. The Boeing license had been valid until September 2020, a person involved in the deal said.

""As we have throughout this process, we'll continue to follow the U.S. government's lead,"" Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe said before Mnuchin's comments.

Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said last month the airplane manufacturer has no Iranian deliveries scheduled this year. He said Boeing's 777 production plan ""is not dependent on the Iranian orders."" Muilenburg is set to address the Economic Club of Washington on Wednesday.

HONG KONG — Chinese authorities and Airbus are investigating why a plane’s windshield blew out midflight, forcing an emergency landing, in an unusual mishap for a country with a booming aviation market and exemplary air safety record.

Sichuan Airlines flight 8633 was en route from Chongqing, China, to Lhasa, Tibet, on Monday morning when the A319 jet’s cockpit window jet flew off, the country’s aviation regulator said. The pilot made a white-knuckle descent to Chengdu, China as the co-pilot was nearly sucked out of the plane, saved only by his seatbelt.

Chinese internet users praised the pilot’s levelheaded response during the harrowing incident but also wanted to know what caused it.

Losing a windshield midflight “is an incredibly rare event,” said Geoffrey Thomas, the Australia-based editor in chief of safety website Airlineratings.com. “You get cracks in windshields from time to time, but certainly they’re designed to be failsafe and this is not supposed to happen.”

The incident does not detract from China’s overall safety record, which rivals that of more advanced countries, he said.

The plane took off at 6:27 a.m. and climbed to 9,800 meters (32,000 feet) when its right-hand windshield “suddenly burst and fell off, causing the cabin to lose pressure and passenger oxygen masks to drop,” the Civil Aviation Administration of China said in a statement on its website.

“There was no sign before the windshield burst. Just a huge noise,” Captain Liu Chuanjian told the newspaper Chengdu Economic Daily. Looking across the cockpit, Liu saw the co-pilot “partially hanging out of the window. Fortunately, he had his seatbelt on.”

Some cockpit equipment was damaged, the CAAC said. Photos posted on Chinese social media showed a control panel partially torn away from the dashboard.

The co-pilot suffered scratches, a flight attendant’s waist was hurt, and 27 of the 119 passengers were injured, according to a post from Sichuan Airlines on Sina Weibo, China’s version of Twitter.

Airbus said Tuesday it has assigned a team to investigate and will cooperate with Chinese authorities.

CAAC said that the Airbus jet began service on July 26, 2011 and its windshield had no record of defects and had not undergone any maintenance or been replaced before the accident. Airbus said the aircraft had logged 19,942 flight hours.

In 1990, an improperly installed windshield on a British Airways jetliner blew out at about 17,300 feet (5,300 meters) after it took off from Birmingham’s airport. The captain was sucked halfway out the BAC 1-11’s window but survived because cabin crew held on to his legs while the co-pilot made an emergency landing. An accident report said the windshield was replaced before the flight with the wrong size bolts.

Earlier this year, a Southwest Airlines jet’s passenger window shattered when it was hit by debris from an exploding engine, killing one passenger.

China’s air safety record improved dramatically after a string of fatal accidents in the 1980s and early 1990s as authorities focused on making improvements. Now, China’s airlines have a “superb record” and the country is “considered an extremely safe place” for air travel, Thomas said.

China’s most recent fatal plane disaster was a military aircraft crash that killed 12 in January. But the country hasn’t had a fatal accident involving a scheduled commercial jetliner flight since 2010, when 44 people were killed in an Embraer jet crash in northeast Heilongjiang province, according to the Aviation Safety Network database.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995143413543701}",neutral,0.9995143413543701,0

Etihad's International ADS-B Upgrade Strategy - Avionics Magazine,"Wed, 30 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vaW50ZXJhY3RpdmUuYXZpYXRpb250b2RheS5jb20vZXRpaGFkcy1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLWFkcy1iLXVwZ3JhZGUtc3RyYXRlZ3kv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At the 2018 AMC/AEEC annual conference, an ADS-B symposium allowed Avionics to gain a first-person perspective on ADS-B mandate compliance upgrades from an Etihad Airways engineer that is on the ground dealing with the wiring, transponder, TCAS computers, GPS sources and the other avionics upgrades other airlines are also dealing with. The Middle Eastern airline is registered to operate under the General Civil Aviation Authority, the civil aviation regulatory authority for the United Arab Emirates (UAE). But it also flies in European and North American airspace, both of which have their own respective ADS-B equipage mandates aside from GCAA’s. Here, we breakdown Etihad’s path to ADS-B compliance, including the tough decisions it will have to make between 2018 and 2025.

Etihad’s International ADS-B Strategy

Borja Roiz is a senior avionics and electrical systems engineer for Etihad Airways, with first-person avionics wiring, computer, transponder touching on the ground perspective on international ADS-B compliance. In September 2017, the UAE’s GCAA provided a reminder on the ADS-B and other avionics mandate compliance Etihad is facing at home before even addressing the FAA’s ADS-B Out mandate. GCAA published an information bulletin noting that its regulatory ATM requirements include the need for operators to equip with GNSS by December 2017 and ADS-B Out by Jan. 1, 2020.

“Even though we’re in April 2018, we still have not decided which of the transponders that we’re going to install in our fleet,” said Roiz.

But Etihad’s engineering team has already plotted out the number of man-hours that would be required to perform the installations.

Currently, the engineering and maintenance team that Roiz is a part of is focused on installing its wiring provision. The team developed a wiring installation upgrade internally, and has begun working through that for its Boeing fleet. Upgrading its Airbus A320/330 fleet has proven more challenging, though, as Etihad purchased service bulletins from Airbus that will allow the airline to perform the mandatory DO-260B wiring provisioning for the future installation and activation of the DO-260B transponder. However, as reported by Etihad during the open discussion session of the annual AMC meeting, Airbus is providing the wiring kits at an average rate of one per month, which has not aligned well with Etihad’s plan to install them during aircraft C-checks. Further complicating the matter is Etihad’s A320 fleet is split into four different configurations that are applicable under the service bulletin, requiring four different kits for the desired modification.

At this point, between the U.S.-operated Airbus and Boeing aircraft, Etihad will need to install 168 new ADS-B DO-260B transponders. Roiz said that it has also mapped out the number of hours required for the ADS-B per aircraft, noting that it breaks out to 14 hours for each A320, 18 hours for each A330 and between three and 15 hours for every Boeing 777 in its fleet.

An important decision that Etihad and other carriers also have to make is the decision to select an OEM’s service bulletin or to establish their own STC path.

“STC is a little more complex,” said Stephane Chartier, a former applications engineer turned senior air transport sales manager for L3. The STC process, Chartier said, is also more complex within the U.S. where the FAA requires a flight test for any new pairing of TCAS transponder and GPS source that it has not previously provided certification on. If a flight test is required, it “can take seven to nine months to get a full certification,” Chartier said during his presentation at the ADS-B Symposium.

The SBAS MMR Challenge

Where the challenge comes in for Etihad is deciding how to provide an upgrade path for the FAA’s Navigation Accuracy Category for Position (NACp) and its Navigation Integrity Category (NIC) in 91.227.

“In UAE it’s standard. Just a DO-260B transponder; that’s no problem. In European airspace, it’s the same situation. You just have to buy one and put it on your airplane,” said Roiz. “The challenge comes in the FAA airspace. They’re asking for not only a DO-260B transponder, they’re asking for an SBAS MMR, which are not even certified today.”

Etihad operates a fleet of 178 total Airbus and Boeing aircraft, including Airbus A320s, A330s, A350s and A380s, as well as Boeing 787-9s and 777s. It also has a total of 51 787s on order and expects to add an additional 10 787s this year.

At this point, between the U.S.-operated Airbus and Boeing aircraft, it will need to install 168 new ADS-B DO-260B transponders.

“Finding the time — that’s the biggest challenge,” said Roiz.

All of the above mentioned aircraft go through C checks every two years, Roiz said.

The primary challenge that Etihad and many other U.S. and non-U.S.-based air carriers are facing in trying to comply with the 2020 ADS-B mandate is the navigation requirement in the U.S. leading to the need to equip with an SBAS MMR. Based on the available in-service in-production commercial air transport category aircraft today, the Airbus A350 and Boeing 737 MAX are the two in-production aircraft that Airbus and Boeing provide featuring an SBAS MMR as standard equipment.

“Ideally we will need another C check for this transponder installation and activation, and right now we’re too close to the mandate and don’t have time to do it,” said Roiz, referring to Etihad’s transponder and MMR upgrade needs. “In our case, we will run out of time. We will have to ground the airplanes to do the modification.”

The two available options to meet the SBAS MMR requirement include the IMMR from Honeywell Aerospace and the GLU 2100 MMR from Rockwell Collins. Certification of these two systems isn’t expected until 2019.

But by Aug. 1, Etihad will have to submit the SBAS MMR upgrade path that it will need to qualify for an exemption to the navigation accuracy requirement that the FAA has provided to operators of all categories of aircraft.

The European Global Navigation Satellite Systems Agency (GSA) defines SBAS as a GNSS measurement provided by navigation reference systems deployed across an entire continent. The systems provide corrections on the positioning information provided by sources of GPS information, such as the aircraft GPS receivers used to provide ADS-B systems with the position of the aircraft in reference to the curvature of the earth. “All measured GNSS errors are transferred to a central computing center where differential corrections and integrity messages are calculated. These calculations are then broadcast over the covered area using geostationary satellites that serve as an augmentation, or overlay, to the original GNSS message,” according to the GSA. What SBAS effectively does is to add additional satellites to the constellation that are stationary above a certain location.

By eventually adding the SBAS capability, Etihad and all other airlines will be able to take advantage of the ground station infrastructure that has already been implemented in countries such as the U.S. with its WAAS system. Europe has the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS), and India has its GPS and GEO Augmented Navigation (GAGAN) system. China is currently developing its own Satellite Navigation Augmentation System (SNAS). South Korea and Russia are also currently developing their own nationwide SBAS systems.

Still, Etihad is left with the need to provide the FAA with a detailed upgrade plan on how it will eventually exist with a technology that is not widely available.

“We have to submit a very detailed upgrade plan to contain each and every aircraft in our fleet and should detail what MMR SBAS compliant you will install on your aircraft,” said Roiz.

The Etihad engineer admits that completing all of the necessary transponder upgrades by Jan. 1, 2020, will be a challenge and could lead to grounding some of its aircraft. But he expects Etihad and its commercial airline counterparts to eventually come up with the best last-minute solution.

“As airlines, we’re very good working under pressure and doing everything last minute. This is coming, and this is what we need to do. Even if we end up doing everything at the last minute, we end up doing it. We will succeed,” said Roiz. AVS","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999818801879883}",neutral,0.9999818801879883,0

The satellite will travel through space for 3.5 years before reaching its destination point about 42 million kilometers from the Sun—the furthest any spacecraft has ever traveled.

Once there, the satellite will continually orbit the giant star. Ten on-board measuring instruments will gather data about the Sun’s heliosphere, polar regions and the side not visible from the Earth, as well as provide images at an extraordinary resolution (with each pixel representing 70 kilometers of the Sun’s surface). Engineers at the European Space Agency (which is funding the mission) hope to use this data to determine the cause of solar wind, which is the continuous streaming of particles from the Sun.

Airbus Defense and Space built the satellite over several years in an ISO 8 clean room at its spacecraft assembly hall in Stevenage, UK. The satellite’s structural and thermal model was assembled first and then shipped to the IABG aerospace test facility near Munich, Germany. There, sensors were temporarily mounted to the model to measure the impact of noise and vibrations on the spacecraft during launch.

A couple years ago, the satellite’s engineering test bench (which simulates the entire mission) underwent electrical and functional testing at Stevenage. Engineers verified that the spacecraft’s end-to-end electrical properties worked as expected.

Late last year, Airbus needed to assemble, integrate and test the satellite’s most sensitive instruments in an ISO 146441 5 clean room. Airbus asked Clean Environments (CE) if it could provide such a clean room and install it in the Stevenage ISO 8 clean room without any work disruption.

CE said yes and, in only eight weeks, customized its portable class 5 Clean Cube for the application. One of the cube’s main benefits is its ultralow outgassing that decreases magnetic contamination and disperses electrostatic fields.

“We have instruments that are highly sensitive to contamination, which could affect their capabilities and performance in space,” explains Lester Waugh, engineering manager at Airbus. “The Clean Cube was selected [because] it provides high levels of cleanliness, and its flexible design allows it to be [relocated] for future programs, as required.”

The cube has an extruded-aluminum frame that is quickly assembled,

disassembled and reconfigured. Frame-wall infill material varies and is carefully selected by CE engineers to best suit the application.

The cube’s structural T-grid ceiling allows lighting units and a fan filter to be easily moved and repositioned.

Adjustable exhaust panels enable the end-user to raise or lower the cube’s ISO classification level.

At Stevenage, CE’s team quickly positioned the pre-built frame and then added the ceiling grid and wall panels. Flow and particulate monitoring of the cube began shortly thereafter. Within 10 days, Airbus performed outgas, electrostatic and electromagnetic testing of the cube, and determined that it surpassed all ISO 146441 class 5 requirements.

CE was founded in 1997 and initially specialized in temporary clean spaces. The company has since developed several rapid-assembly, HEPA-filtered products for creating portable and permanent clean rooms.

The MoU covers the supply of titanium and the manufacture of finished and semi-finished products. The French metals and alloys specialists Aubert & Duval, a division of the mining group Eramet ( Paris , France ), and UKTMP will set up a joint venture, UKAD, to manufacture from the titanium ingots delivered by UKTMP and improve the vertical integration of the titanium supply chain to EADS and Airbus. UKTMP is the only fully integrated titanium producer in the world covering mining, titanium sponge and semi finished titanium products. In addition to the EADS supply, the joint venture will produce and market semi-finished products in the form of titanium ingots and bars.



In the initial phase setting up the project, expected to start operation in 2011, will take an investment of $60 million followed by a further investment of $30 million. The location of the plant is under discussion.



The MoU was signed during a visit to Kazakhstan by the French Prime Minister Francois Fillon. During the visit another MoU was signed with the Kazyna Sustainable Development Fund for a strategic partnership in the development of the aerospace industry and related services in the country.



Titanium is another basic industrial resource metal in tight supply globally. Japanese imports increased by 90 resource in 2007 over 2006 when imports from China increased by a factor of 5.8 from China which became Japan 's largest supplier, displacing Russia .



In a basic process breakthrough for titanium producers, a team of researchers at Leeds University in the United Kingdom under engineering professor Animesh Jha have developed a simpler, cheaper and greener method of extracting higher yields of titanium oxide (TiO2), the base feed product for downstream manufacturing. The newly patented process consists of roasting the mineral ore with alkali to remove contaminants, which are washed and leached with acid to yield valuable byproducts for the electronics industry. The coarse residue left behind is then reacted with 20 times less than the usual amount of chlorine to produce TiO2 powder.



The Leeds process gives an average yield of up to 97 percent TiO2 compared with the current industry average of 85 percent. This level of purity will reduce production costs of pigment grade materials and waste disposal costs. In addition the process also recycles waste CO2 and heat. Jha is confident that the process can be further refined to produce 99 percent pure TiO2.



The $9.6 billion global market will welcome the new process, which avoids the pollution and waste of current processes used to purify the relatively abundant but impure mineral ore.

Welcome to Airbus Corporate Jet’s new Harmony cabin, a swirling concept that could fit easily into the world of arch-villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld and his vodka Martini-loving nemesis.

This is not a cabin designed for the hoi polloi, but for those with the significant wherewithal to allow them to leave behind the tighter confines of traditional business jets for the luxury of a widebody.

Originally designed for ACJ330neo family, it can also be used on other widebodies such as the ACJ350 XWB.

Neither aircraft is cheap — the 2018 list price for an A330-900neo passenger version is $296.4 million — but what you get is space and range.

Read: Airbus and Zodiac to develop sleeper cargo berths.

Airbus puts the range of the 58.82m-long plane, which has new fuel-efficient engines and aerodynamic tweaks such as sharklets, at 17,400km with a passenger load of 25.

The company says this means the aircraft can fly “nonstop to the world”

The manufacturer’s new concept adds some 007 pizzazz with concentric circles designed to emulate the ripples in a pond. It says this and widebody benefits such as space, comfort and quietness produce “a consistently harmonious customer experience”.

“Harmony is a timeless and elegant design concept because we dare to break the conventions that are traditionally imposed on us as cabin designers,’’ says ACJ head of creative design Sylvain Mariat. “Our creativity needs to be unique to fit the needs of our customers, as befits a host receiving their guests in their ‘world above the world’.’’

The holographic globe shows the aircraft’s position as passengers enter, with a master bedroom, office and bathroom to the left.

The spacious lounge has seating grouped at round tables designed to encourage social interaction with a conference table at the back.

Behind that are four VIP suites, offices which convert into a bedroom with an ensuite bathroom and shower.

Seating for support staff and a galley make up the rear of the cabin, which can be adapted to serve both private and government customers.

The company has more than 190 corporate jets in service on every continent, including Antarctica, but it is not the only manufacturer offering bigger business jets.

Rival Boeing Business Jets announced this week it had so far won four new orders this year after selling 16 jets in 2017.

Boeing said two of the new orders this year are for the single-aisle BBJ MAX, adding to a backlog of 19 aircraft.

Based on the new 737 MAX passenger plane, the BBJ MAX delivers 14 percent better fuel efficiency thanks to advanced engines and improved aerodynamics.

The aircraft is capable of flying 7,000 nautical miles (12,964 km) and features a lower cabin altitude, bespoke interiors and 787-style flight deck displays.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9992140531539917}",neutral,0.9992140531539917,0

In recent months, ACJ has been assessing the individual completion centers in the Lufthansa Technik network with regard to their capabilities to handle future modifications and completions of the ACJ350 XWB, with key considerations including overall quality, adherence to deadlines and technical planning.

Lufthansa Technik’s case was strengthened by its MRO experience with the commercial A350 XWB, with daily technical services carried out on the aircraft type for customers such as Lufthansa. Lufthansa Technik is licensed to maintain the Airbus A350 XWB in all aspects of the aircraft’s life cycle, and at the beginning of 2017, the company received an extension of its approval as a design organization for A350 XWB from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA Part 21/J). The company is thus authorized to develop and approve repairs and modifications to a limited extent under its own responsibility.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9823532104492188}",positive,0.9823532104492188,1
"United Airlines' Boeing 767s may be replaced, according to a report. - USA TODAY","Wed, 09 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdHJhdmVsL2ZsaWdodHMvdG9kYXlpbnRoZXNreS8yMDE4LzA1LzA5L3VuaXRlZC1haXJsaW5lcy1ib2VpbmctNzY3LXMtbWF5LXJlcGxhY2VkLWFjY29yZGluZy1yZXBvcnQvNTk1MDY5MDAyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Report: United looking to replace Boeing 767 widebody jets

United Airlines may be in the market for a big widebody purchase, with Reuters reporting the Chicago-based carrier is in talks with both Boeing and Airbus for a purchase that would help it replace the roughly 50 Boeing 767s that currently fly in its fleet.

Reuters cites unnamed “people familiar with the discussions” in its report.

In that report, Reuters says:

""Europe’s Airbus is expected to offer its upgraded A330neo jet against Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner in a deal potentially worth some $14 billion at list prices, the two sources said. All three companies declined to comment on the nature of the talks.""

United declined to comment on the Reuters report.

""We are always talking to our manufacturers about future fleet plans, but we won’t comment on the nature of those discussions,"" spokesman Frank Benenati said in a statement to USA TODAY's Today in the Sky blog.

United’s Boeing 767s are among the oldest types of planes in the carrier’s mainline fleet, with an average age of about 21 years, according to Airfleets.net.

If United does proceed with an order, winning it would be a boon for whichever jetmaker seals the deal.

Airbus, of course, has been stung by recent developments for its new A330neo model.

Hawaiian Airlines backtracked on an order earlier this year for the A330neo, opting to instead for competitor Boeing’s 787-9 Dreamliner. American Airlines also recently placed an order for 47 new Boeing Dreamliners, picking that model over competing models sold by Airbus.

United already flies Boeing 787 Dreamliners and has more on order. Once United begins taking delivery of its first “dash 10” variants of the 787 later this year, its fleet will include all three versions of the jet produced by Boeing. United was one of the first customers to begin flying Boeing’s first Dreamliner model – the 787-8. It has since taken the 787-9 model, too.

United’s fleet does not include the Airbus A330, though the airline does have more than 40 of Airbus's A350 widebodies on order. Deliveries of that model are set to begin arriving to United in 2022.

United's current Boeing 767s seat up to 242 passengers, depending on the model and precise configuration. Depending on the variant, Airbus' A330neos could seat between 250 and 310 passengers in a typical two-class configuration. United's existing 787-8s and 787-9s are configured to seat 219 and 252 passengers, respectively. United's bigger 787-10s will be configured with 318 seats, according to a report from FlightGlobal.com.

Flying Every Which Way (Including Upside-Down) in the New Airbus H160 Helicopter - The Drive,"Thu, 31 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRyaXZlLmNvbS90ZWNoLzIxMTc4L2ZseWluZy1ldmVyeS13aGljaC13YXktaW5jbHVkaW5nLXVwc2lkZS1kb3duLWluLXRoZS1uZXctYWlyYnVzLWgxNjAtaGVsaWNvcHRlctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"My first hint this wasn’t going to be a normal helicopter demonstration flight came when I saw my camera floating inches in front of my face.

It was strapped to me, but I still reached out and yanked it from the sky in mid-hover. The camera and I were in free-fall, for a few seconds—hence that brief flirtation with zero-g—while Airbus Helicopters test pilot Olivier Gensse demonstrated the new H160 chopper’s precise and responsive powerplant. Specifically, he was showing off the helicopter's ability to deliver power immediately when you need it, without drama or the kind of overcorrection that can send other helicopters onto their backs.

Not that the H160 couldn’t handle even that, though. A few minutes after the free-falling power demonstration over rural New Jersey, Gensse demonstrated the chopper's stability by pitching the helicopter straight up and then onto its back before aiming straight down toward the ground and recovering with incredible smoothness. That’s right—we were inverted in a helicopter. The specific purpose of that demo, presented to the pilots of prospective corporate customers, was to show the aircraft’s “margins”—or the extra performance padding pilots have in an emergency. You wouldn’t ever fly like that in daily use, of course, but it’s nice to know what the helicopter can really do if you ever need to.

Eric

By comparison, the rest of the flight felt like a cakewalk—though still plenty dramatic at times. Gensse pitched the H160 onto its side, then double-clicked a button on the control yoke to show off the helicopter’s ability to recover automatically from a severe upset. This could save a flight should the pilot become disoriented in bad weather, or for any reason uncertain about precisely what control inputs are required to right the ship. It’s part of the Airbus’s philosophy with the H160—automate as much of the flying as possible, so the pilot can manage his or her mission and focus on the essentials of navigation and communication. That diminished workload pays off as much in routine situations as it does during crises, by reducing stress and the possibility of error.

“The fewer decisions a pilot has to make, the fewer opportunities for error,” said Gennse. “I like flying to be easy.”

Eric Adams

The H160 helicopter falls into the “medium” category in size and performance, targeted toward VIP transport, oil-rig crew transfers, emergency services, and other commercial and industrial applications. Airbus hasn’t released pricing data, but helicopters in this category sneak low double-digit millions of dollars. This model can seat up to 12 passengers and fly up to 460 nautical miles, with a top speed of 177 miles per hour. It burns 15 percent less fuel than previous-generation engines, and thanks to innovative scimitar-shaped rotor blades, it's 50 percent quieter than competitive models as measured from directly below. (The aerodynamic tweaks to the blades also eliminate the signature chopping sound made by most helicopters.) And indeed, the noise inside was noticeably reduced—you couldn’t exactly whisper to one another, but you also don’t have to shout when holding a conversation without headsets on.

Eric Adams

Other tricks include a two-tier rear stabilizer called a biplane (yes, time is a flat circle) that improves stability at low speed by reducing the impact of rotor downwash you’d get with a larger stabilizer, and a canted fenestron—Airbus’s version of the tail rotor, which is shrouded to improve safety. In the H160, it’s also angled downward, to contribute to lift as well as overall stability.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9994080066680908}",neutral,0.9994080066680908,0
Lee County acquires 6 H125s to upgrade fleet for aerial spraying - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 16 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2xlZS1jb3VudHktYWNxdWlyZXMtNi1oMTI1cy11cGdyYWRlLWZsZWV0LWFlcmlhbC1zcHJheWluZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Lee County Mosquito Control District in Florida is operating six new Airbus H125 helicopters as part of a major upgrade of its aircraft fleet. The new aircraft are being used to support aerial spraying to control the mosquito population in the roughly 1,000 square-mile district in southwest Florida, which includes the city of Fort Myers.

Lee County officials selected the H125 because of its superior performance and ability to carry a heavier load. Each H125 is capable of hauling about 1,000 pounds more equipment and mosquito abatement product than the previous aircraft in certain configurations, allowing the district to cut the number of helicopters it operates from 10 to six.

“The bottom line is the H125 will improve our fuel efficiency and cut down on maintenance,” said Rick O’Neal of the Lee County Mosquito Control District. “Six aircraft will now do the work that 10 used to do.”

Airbus Helicopters Inc. received a supplemental type certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to allow the Lee County aircraft to operate at the higher weight necessary to meet the mission requirements.

“We take great pride in helping our customers achieve their missions,” said Chris Emerson, president of Airbus Helicopters Inc. “The H125 is the leading high-performance single-engine helicopter available, and we are pleased that the Lee County Mosquito Control District selected it to conduct their missions of protecting citizens by fighting disease-carrying mosquitoes.”

Created in 1958, the Lee County Mosquito Control District is committed to improving the quality of life, facilitating outdoor activities and protecting public health by implementing environmentally sound practices that control mosquito populations throughout the Gulf Coast county. The district operates both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters.

The district expects to operate each of the H125s 200 to 250 hours a year, O’Neal said. The peak mosquito-fighting season is May through September.

Airbus Helicopters Inc. produces the H125 at its final assembly plant in Columbus, Mississippi, by a workforce that includes about 40 percent U.S. military veterans. The H125 is known for its high performance, payload, reliability, and multi-mission flexibility.

Airbus Helicopters is a leading provider of civil and commercial helicopters in the U.S. The company is based in Grand Prairie, Texas, where it operates helicopter completion, paint, and MRO facilities, performs flight test and engineering support, and flight and maintenance training for customers.

The Columbus plant produces UH-72A Lakota helicopters for the U.S. Army and the H125 for the civil market.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9997313618659973}",positive,0.9997313618659973,1
