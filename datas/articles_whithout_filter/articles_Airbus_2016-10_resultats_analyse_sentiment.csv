Airbus' Best Planes and Biggest Accomplishments - WIRED,"Fri, 14 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS8yMDE2LzEwL2FpcmJ1cy13ZW50LWJvZWluZy13YW5uYWJlLWhpZ2gtZmx5aW5nLWlubm92YXRvci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Today, Airbus hands Singapore Airlines the keys to a shiny new A350-900. Besides receiving a big check, Airbus gets to celebrate: This widebody jet is the 10,000th plane it has delivered. It's an impressive milestone for a planemaker whose chief nemesis Boeing celebrated its 100th birthday this year.

Airbus Industrie, a European consortium based in Toulouse, France, started bolting wings to engines in 1970, when Boeing was celebrating its 54th anniversary. It was formed because France, Germany, and initially, Britain wanted to beat those damn Yankees by developing their own “air bus” — a small, short-haul plane. Almost half a century on, Airbus rivals Boeing in marketshare, and deserves credit for some revolutionary innovations, including fly-by-wire and double-decker passenger jets.

The plane was the sixth one received by Singapore Air, which placed its first order with Airbus in 1979, and went into service on the airline's nonstop service between Singapore and San Francisco, which lasts at least 14 hours.



At an event celebrated at Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France — complete with giant balloons and a massive cake — Airbus CEO Tom Enders told a group that ""In the 1970s, Airbus was producing at the rate of half an aircraft per month. Today we deliver more than 600 aircraft per year. Every year we get faster and more efficient.""

Airbus has a secret flying-car project called Vahana - The Verge,"Fri, 21 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDE2LzEwLzIxLzEzMzU3NjkwL2FpcmJ1cy1mbHlpbmctY2FyLXZhaGFuYS1hLWN1YmVkLWF1dG9ub21vdXMtdGF4adIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The European aerospace giant Airbus recently unveiled its secret flying-car project dubbed Vahana — a single-manned, autonomously piloted aircraft that can take off and land vertically. Cue the Jetsons references!

The concept drawing of Vahana should look familiar to anyone who follows the tiny-but-passionate flying car movement. The aircraft has eight rotors on two sets of wings, both of which tilt depending on whether the car’s flying vertically or horizontally. There’s room for a single passenger under a canopy that retracts like a visor. The aircraft will be deployed like a taxi, making it the air-taxi version of Uber, according to CNN Money.

The project launched in early 2016 as one of the first pursuits of A³ (pronounced A-cubed), the Silicon Valley arm of Airbus, according to the startup’s CEO Rodin Lyasoff. Vahana is a Sanskrit word that refers to the vehicle or mount of a god, but Lyasoff says his feet are firmly rooted in reality when it comes to the project.

“Beyond developing the vehicle itself,” Lyasoff wrote in a Medium post quietly published last month, “we’re seeking to move key technology categories forward, foster development of the regulatory regime for the certification and operation of automated aircraft, and to otherwise nurture an ecosystem that will help enable the vertical cities of the future.”

Airbus, which competes with the US-based Boeing, is best known for large jetliners like the double-decker A380. However, the flying car project shows that the Toulouse, France-based company is not above dabbling in some high-concept, and perhaps unrealistic, aviation ideas.

Lyasoff says his team of engineers, designers, and robotics experts are aiming to fly a full-size prototype before the end of 2017, and to have a “productizable demonstrator” by 2020.

There are many things about flying cars that make them impractical

The fact that flying cars act as a stand-in for some distant, unattainable future isn’t a mistake. There are many things about flying cars that make them impractical, unworkable, and even wrongheaded. Airspace in North America and Europe is tightly regulated, making it extremely difficult for any company to gain permission for commercial flight, especially in dense urban environments. And the idea of autonomous aircraft would probably strike most passengers as a recipe for disaster.

Lyasoff insists that pilotless flying cars are an attainable dream, if only because the rules governing the skies are bound to change in the future. Plus robot aircraft are cheaper to produce. “Full automation also enables us to make our aircraft as small and light as possible, and will significantly reduce manufacturing costs,” Lyasoff says.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999962329864502}",neutral,0.999962329864502,0
Airbus celebrates the delivery of its 10000th aircraft - Airbus,"Fri, 14 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNi0xMC1haXJidXMtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy10aGUtZGVsaXZlcnktb2YtaXRzLTEwMDAwdGgtYWlyY3JhZnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

Positioned for the future with world’s most modern and complete aircraft family

Airbus today celebrated the delivery of its 10,000th aircraft - an A350-900 for Singapore Airlines. The milestone event was marked by a special ceremony in Toulouse hosted by Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders and attended by Goh Choon Phong, CEO of Singapore Airlines.

The aircraft delivered today is the sixth A350-900 for Singapore Airlines, out of a total order for 67. Featuring a special “10,000th Airbus” logo, the aircraft will be used to launch the airline’s new non-stop services between Singapore and San Francisco later this month.

The 10,000th Airbus delivery comes as the manufacturer achieves its highest level of production ever and is on track to deliver at least 650 aircraft this year from its extensive product line. These range from 100 to over 600 seats and efficiently meet every airline requirement, from high frequency short haul operations to the world’s longest intercontinental flights.

“Since our earliest days innovation has been at the heart of everything we do at Airbus,” said Tom Enders, Airbus Group CEO. “This has seen us develop what is today the world’s most modern and comprehensive aircraft family. And with a strong emphasis on R&T, continuous innovation and product improvement, we will ensure that we remain ahead of the curve, delivering airlines the best our industry has to offer.”

“We are especially proud to celebrate this milestone with Singapore Airlines – one of our longest standing customers and a true partner. Today, the SIA Group operates aircraft from across our complete product line and with the highest levels of technical excellence. There is no better endorsement for our products and we thank the entire SIA Group for its ongoing confidence, partnership and support.”

“Singapore Airlines is honoured to be receiving the 10,000th aircraft that Airbus has delivered. Airbus aircraft have contributed greatly to Singapore Airlines’ successes over the decades, and we are proud to be sharing this important milestone with our longstanding and trusted partner,” said Goh Choon Phong, CEO of Singapore Airlines. “Today’s delivery shows just how far Airbus has come over the decades. On behalf of the staff and management of Singapore Airlines, I would like to congratulate Airbus for reaching this incredible milestone.”

Singapore Airlines placed its first order with Airbus in 1979 and over the years the carrier and its subsidiaries have ordered every successive model produced by the manufacturer. Today the mainline carrier operates the A330, A350 XWB and A380, while its regional subsidiaries Silkair and Tigerair fly aircraft from the single aisle A320 Family.

Airbus delivered its first aircraft, an A300B2, to Air France on 10 May 1974. Initially working exclusively in the widebody sector with the A300 and A310, the manufacturer moved into the single aisle market in the mid-1980s with the launch of the best-selling A320. Setting new standards in aircraft design, technologies introduced on the A320 were subsequently incorporated on the A330 and A340 in the early 1990s, marking the first time that single aisle and widebody aircraft benefitted from similar operational characteristics.

This high level of design commonality is unique to Airbus aircraft types and has been retained across the company’s product line ever since, including on the double deck A380 and the all-new long range A350 XWB which entered service last year.

Through the company’s process of continuous product improvement, the Airbus product line has been regularly enhanced over the years with each subsequent development bringing significant benefits in terms of fuel efficiency, operational reliability and passenger comfort. In recent years this has recently seen the company invest in the A320neo Family, which entered commercial service this year, and the A330neo Family, currently in development and with first delivery planned for the end of 2017.

Also under advanced stage of development is the second version of the all-new A350 XWB, the A350-1000, which is set for first flight before year end and first delivery in the second half of 2017. Together, the members of the A350 XWB Family are redefining long haul travel in the larger twin aisle market, consuming 25 per cent less fuel and bringing new levels of passenger comfort, with more personal space in all classes.

The current Airbus product line comprises a total of 16 models spread across four aircraft Families – the A320, A330, A350 XWB and A380.

Airbus has recorded over 16,700 orders for its various models and its aircraft are flying today with more than 400 airlines worldwide. The company’s backlog of 6,700 aircraft on order for future delivery is the highest ever recorded by any aircraft manufacturer and represents some 10 years of full production at current rates.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999994039535522}",positive,0.9999994039535522,1

"Milestone! Airbus just delivered its 10,000th aircraft - USA TODAY","Fri, 14 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdHJhdmVsL2ZsaWdodHMvdG9kYXlpbnRoZXNreS8yMDE2LzEwLzE0L21pbGVzdG9uZS1haXJidXMtanVzdC1kZWxpdmVyZWQtaXRzLTEwMDAwdGgtYWlyY3JhZnQvOTIwMTg2NjAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Milestone! Airbus just delivered its 10,000th aircraft

TOULOUSE, France — Airbus celebrated both its past and its future Friday, hitting a major milestone by delivering the 10,000th aircraft in the company's history.

Perhaps fittingly, the plane designated as the European jetmaker’s landmark delivery is its newest aircraft type: an Airbus A350 bound for Singapore Airlines.

""We are honored and proud to have Singapore Airlines receive our 10,000th aircraft today,"" Airbus CEO Tom Enders said as the jet was handed over to the Asian carrier at an official ceremony under dreary skies and drizzle.

""10,000 is an astonishing number,""' Enders said.

Singapore Airlines CEO Goh Choon Phong followed Enders, calling it a ""remarkable milestone"" for Airbus before saying Singapore Air was ""honored to be receiving this extra-special aircraft.""

The jet — emblazoned with a commemorative ""10,000th Airbus aircraft"" logo — is the sixth A350 to join Singapore Airlines' fleet, which will include at least 67 of the new-age models. Saturday, the aircraft will depart for Singapore, where it’s likely to make its first revenue passenger flight barely a week later on the carrier’s inaugural non-stop flight from Singapore to San Francisco.

The route will become the longest in Singapore Airlines’ entire network, a notable distinction for a carrier that considers itself a pioneer of ultra-long-haul flying.

By distance, the 8,435-mile San Francisco-Singapore route is the world’s third-longest regularly scheduled airline flight. Singapore will share that ranking with United, which launched its own San Francisco-Singapore service in June, according to airline data firm OAG.

Only two airlines fly longer routes. Qantas’ non-stop route between Dallas/Fort Worth and Sydney clocks in at 8,576 miles while Emirates holds the title for “world’s longest flight” with its 8,819-mile flight between Dubai and Auckland, New Zealand.

The 10,000th delivery marks a major milestone for Airbus, whose first commercial passenger aircraft — the Airbus A300 widebody — entered service in 1974. Airbus has since rolled out numerous other models, including the A310, A320, A330, A380 and the new A350. Airbus' A320 family of jets includes the A319 and A321 variants.

Still, Airbus’ 10,00th delivery falls short of the count at U.S. rival Boeing, which has a significantly longer history. Boeing — which celebrated its centennial anniversary this summer — says it has delivered 21,264 airplanes since 1958, which is when its 707 debuted. Boeing’s delivery count includes 17,779 current and discontinued “7-series” jets (the 707, 717, 727, 737, 747, 767, 777 and 787) as well as 3,485 planes delivered by McDonnell Douglas and Douglas, which have since become part of Boeing.

For Airbus, Friday's 10,00th delivery was a chance for the company to celebrate its successes as it moves into its fifth decade. Enders wondered what the founding employees of Airbus might think of Friday's milestone delivery.

Enders described the company's original executives as ""visionaries,"" but said, ""Even they could not have foreseen that we would be delivering already in 2016 our 10,000th aircraft.

""In the 1970s, we were producing at the rate of just over half an aircraft per month. And there were years, I'm told, when we had more cancellations than new orders,"" Enders continued. ""Today, we deliver more than 600 aircraft a year, and the ramp up is continuing."" He noted Airbus has set a goal of delivering its next 10,000 aircraft in 10 more years.

""Why shouldn't we be ambitious?"" he asked.

Singapore Air CEO Phong said, ""It shows how far Airbus has come over the decades.""

Sidenotes from Toulouse

•Airbus officials talked up the company's growing presence before the landmark delivery to Singapore Airlines.

""We have a footprint everywhere in the world,"" Marisa Lucas-Ugena, the head of A350 XWB Marketing for Airbus, said Thursday at the company's headquarters as the jetmaker readied for the landmark delivery to Singapore. She noted that in addition to Airbus' facilities across Europe, the jetmaker assembles planes in Alabama and China and is developing a large training center in Singapore.

•Singapore Airlines was happy to play up its role in the superlative delivery for Airbus.

Campbell Wilson, Singapore Air's sales and marketing chief, said it would be a ""very special"" moment to take delivery of Airbus' 10,000th jet. Singapore has long had a history with Airbus. Most recently, the carrier was the launch customer for Airbus' ""superjumbo"" A380 — the world's largest commercial passenger aircraft.

""Singapore Airliines has a strong history of innovation that parallels our own,"" Bob Lange of Airbus SVP Market and Product Strategy said at a delivery ceremony Friday in Toulouse.

Wilson pointed to Singapore Air's long-standing role as an aviation groundbreaker, noting the airline also took delivery of a milestone Boeing aircraft — the 1,000th 747 in the 1990s.

"Looking 15 years ahead for Airbus, Boeing - Leeham News and Analysis","Wed, 05 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNi8xMC8wNS9sb29raW5nLTE1LXllYXJzLWFoZWFkLWFpcmJ1cy1ib2Vpbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Oct. 5, 2016, © Leeham Co.: The next 15 years won’t bring any relief to crowded airports and airplanes but nevertheless there are warning signs for the likes of Airbus, Boeing and the supply chain.

Looking ahead to 2030 will see aircraft production peaking early in the next decade but begin to fall off or the Big Two Original Equipment Manufacturers as new entrants begin to be felt, predicts Michel Merluzeau, an independent consultant.

Merluzeau presented his forecast yesterday to the British American Business Council Pacific Northwest chapter’s annual one-day conference in Seattle.

“I’m pretty comfortable about the next five years. I’m comfortable in the next five years. The five years after that,” Merluzeau said his confidence level declines because there are so many variables, ranging from issues within the industry to large ones outside it.

New Entrants

While Airbus and Boeing will continue to be the dominant producers of commercial airliners, China’s plans for the C919 single-aisle airplane and the C929 dual aisle aircraft will begin to make inroads in the mid-2020 decade and in the 2030 decade, he said.

At the other end of the spectrum, Bombardier’s CSeries won’t make much of dent, he said.

Supplier pressure

For suppliers, the next 15 years is about cost reduction efforts, Merluzeau said. “It’s about industrial policy and government interference or support. It’s about getting others into cost reduction programs. It’s about Tier 2 and Tier 3 suppliers asking whether they want to stay in this business.”

The supply chain stress is at highest since World War II, he said, notably at the “bookends:” materials and interiors.

Increasing use of robotics is a certainty, Merluzeau said.

By the numbers

Merluzeau gave specific predictions by equipment type of the market demand over the next 16 years. He sees a future for the Airbus A380, but not the Boeing 747-8.

Airbus

A320: 9,226.

A330: 1,264. “The A330 continues to do very, very well.”

A350: 1,547.

A380: 363. Merluzeau said the next five to six years will be “very difficult” for the A380, but when the New Engine Option is launched, new life will breathe into this airplane. Merluzeau agrees with the underlying Airbus argument that airport congestion, airway pressure and demographics of mega-cities provide life to this program.

“Airbus is a little bit concerning toward the back end of the forecast,” he said. “They are so vested in narrow body aircraft. Sales on wide-body will soften toward the back-end of forecast.”

Boeing

Merluzeau believes Boeing will launch the Middle of the Market aircraft, which he calls the 7M7. It will be a twin-aisle jet that replaces not just the Boeing 767-sized aircraft but also the 787-8, which he says will be discontinued in 2020 or 2021. (Note: this concurs with LNC’s forecast.)

737 MAX: 7,767.

777 Family (Classic and X): 1,200.

787: 1,600.

MOM: 836. (The MOM EIS is forecast for about 2024-25, so note that this is about a mid-program forecast.)

“My outlook on Boeing is pretty good, pretty steady until 2024-25 when MAX production begins to fall. MOM aircraft will enter service and support sales, production,” Merluzeau said.

“Part of the business case for 7M7 is that the 787-8 will go away around 2020-21,” he said. “Part of the market will be covered by 7M7.”

Airbus Helicopters' Operations Firmly Rooted in Grand Prairie - dallasinnovates.com,"Thu, 06 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZGFsbGFzaW5ub3ZhdGVzLmNvbS9haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtb3BlcmF0aW9ucy1maXJtbHktcm9vdGVkLWdyYW5kLXByYWlyaWUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters’ Operations Firmly Rooted in Grand Prairie A division of Netherlands-based Airbus Group, the operation supports nearly 12,000 helicopters operated by more than 3,000 customers in 154 countries.

A helicopter’s operational life can span a generation or longer.

The folks at Airbus Helicopter‘s North American headquarters in Grand Prairie play a key role in achieving that longevity, and in doing so nimbly, Airbus Helicopters’ VP of Business Development & Strategy, Sebastien Delmaire said.

Delmaire spoke on the topic of Airbus Helicopters’ work in Grand Prairie, following a French-American Chamber of Commerce-Dallas/Fort Worth lecture on Sept. 27.

“We’re very close to the DFW (International) Airport, which is very accessible for our customers,” Delmaire said, following his presentation. “We have a four-hour flight window to see all our customers. We have a parts/logistics center at DFW that’s open seven days a week. We can ship parts 24-7, via FedEx and UPS.”

“We’re very close to the DFW (International) Airport, which is very accessible for our customers.”

Sebastien Delmaire

The company’s demand for customer service is substantial. Airbus Helicopters — a division of Netherlands-based Airbus Group –- supports nearly 12,000 helicopters operated by more than 3,000 customers in 154 countries.

Delmaire said the company stocks more than $100 million worth of helicopter parts at its DFW Logistics Center, from which parts are shipped via overnight delivery anywhere in North and South America.

Also supplying that service is more than 600 Airbus Helicopters employees at its Grand Prairie headquarters, which hosts the company’s helicopter and components maintenance and repair operations, and performs avionics repairs for Airbus’ fixed-wing aircraft.

The Texas location is one of the company’s three global regional customer support centers (the others are in Marignane, France, and Singapore), all of which provide spare parts and technical support to thousands of clients. Grand Prairie has served as a base for Airbus Helicopters and its predecessors (Eurocopter, Vought Helicopter Inc., Aerospatiale Corporation, etc.) since 1969.

AIRBUS HELICOPTERS’ CENTRAL U.S. OPERATIONS HAVE WORKED WELL

The Grand Prairie operation also serves as a hub for the company’s North American sales and marketing forces (which are stationed at various locales across the U.S.), has two flight simulators, as well as flight-testing facilities, Delmaire said.

Airbus Helicopters’ central U.S. operation has worked out well, also in part because of its proximity to contractors that support its operations, he added.

Recently, Airbus Helicopters made headlines for selling Dallas Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones his new H145 model, which has a plush interior that can be removed for work trips to Jones’ ranch.

The company made bigger news when its craft became first to land on top of Mount Everest, set a record as “the World’s Fastest Helicopter,” and used a gull-wing configured propeller blade (called Blue Edge) and a patented method of enclosing tail rotors, called “Fenestron,” to cut noise levels by about half.

“You need to produce this aircraft for 20 years, at least, if you want to break even.”

Sebastien Delmaire

While speaking before helicopter enthusiasts and members of the French-American Chamber, Delmaire said Airbus Helicopters must constantly strike the balance between innovation (extending helicopters’ range, payload, efficiency, and decreasing noise) and financial realities.

“You need to produce this aircraft for 20 years, at least, if you want to break even,” he said, adding that the company must support that helicopter for 20 years, post-production.

Add to this that Airbus Helicopters can take up to 15 years to develop, even longer than many satellites and submarines, which can take 12 years to develop, he said.

Delmaire said another major challenge for innovating at Airbus Helicopters –- which employs 22,000 people worldwide –- is the company’s sheer size. Designers were told to literally go back to the drawing board.

“Innovation is part of our DNA. That’s why we’re still number one on the commercial market in the world, and in the USA.”

Sebastien Delmaire

“They were encouraged to start from the beginning,” he said.

The company strengthens innovation by encouraging new hires to speak out with their new ideas, and by continuing to employ experienced workers who have already successfully implemented breakthroughs, he added.

“Innovation is part of our DNA,” Delmaire said in an interview following his presentation. “That’s why we’re still number one on the commercial market in the world, and in the USA.”

Also speaking to the French-American Chamber of Commerce on Sept. 27 was Airbus Helicopters flight test engineer Denis Hamel, and Jay Carter, CEO and Principal Design Engineer of Wichita Falls, Texas-based Carter Aviation Technologies.

That airplane, to be registered 9V-SMF, is also the 10,000th aircraft delivered by Airbus. We take a look at Airbus’ historical deliveries and what’s ahead for the airframer as well as how you can track Airbus aircraft on Flightradar24. All data below is taken from Airbus’ Orders and Deliveries data, current as of 30 September 2016.

In 1974, Airbus delivered its first aircraft to launch customer Air France. The airline took delivery of the A300B2 in May of that year. Since then, Airbus has delivered 9,982 aircraft to 393 customers, operated by 421 different airlines.

The difference between customers and operators is explained by leasing companies, like ILFC or AerCap, purchasing the aircraft from Airbus and then leasing them to airlines.

Airbus’ best selling aircraft is the A320, with 4,320 delivered. Combining all members of the A320 family, including the A318, A319, A320 (and A320neo) and A321, Airbus has delivered 7,256 single-aisle aircraft accounting for 72.6% of total deliveries by the company.

A look at Airbus’ complete order book shows where the next few thousand aircraft will go. Airbus has 4,812 orders for the New Engine Option (neo) versions of its A320 family. The airframer has 809 orders for its A350XWB. Airbus is also moving towards first flight for its A330neo, scheduled for first flight in 2017.

Tracking Airbus Aircraft

Airbus will deliver aircraft number 10,000 on Friday to Singapore Airlines, but before it does, it will conduct test flights as registration F-WZFD. We have previously written about pre-delivery test flights, but the easiest way to follow Airbus test flights is to set a callsign filter for ‘AIB’ and focus your map over Europe.

It’s easy to track delivered Airbus aircraft on Flightradar24.com and in our mobile apps. In our mobile apps, just set your filters for the particular aircraft or family of aircraft you’re looking for. On the web (or in our flight tracker app as well) use ICAO aircraft type codes to filter for the aircraft you want to follow. Airbus’ newest type, the A350-1000 is type code ‘A35K’. That aircraft is scheduled for first flight before the end of 2016.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999983310699463}",neutral,0.9999983310699463,0
Coming Soon: Airbus 380 & Boeing 747 Side-by-Side at MRO in America's Heartland - Aviation Pros,"Tue, 11 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdmlhdGlvbnByb3MuY29tL2FpcmNyYWZ0L2FydGljbGUvMTIyMDYyNTMvY29taW5nLXNvb24tYWlyYnVzLTM4MC1ib2VpbmctNzQ3LXNpZGUtYnktc2lkZS1hdC1tcm8taW4tYW1lcmljYXMtaGVhcnRsYW5k0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In June, the Chicago Rockford International Airport (RFD) will open dual 300-foot span hangars built by Rubb Building Systems to be operated by AAR. Strategically located in the Midwest, this advanced MRO facility will employ over 500 skilled workers.

Neither snow, nor rain, nor cold, nor heat, nor wind nor gloom of funding are stopping Chicago Rockford International’s new MRO facility from coming on line in June, capable of servicing an Airbus 380 and Boeing 747 at the same time.

“Even an extreme blizzard won’t slow the efficiency of the Rockford MRO,” says Jeff Polsean, economic development manager, Chicago Rockford International Airport. “Now, we have overcome severe funding challenges. Five hundred skilled workers will soon enjoy natural light in ideal working conditions at the 24 hour per day 200,000 square-foot facility, delivered by Rubb Building Systems, operated by AAR.”

Says Dan Roszkowski, president of project’s architectural firm Larson & Darby, “This one-of-a-kind building is truly mammoth as an MRO facility. It’s impressive from the inside and practical for all kinds of repair.”

“RFD’s new facility is changing the business landscape not only the airport ground, but the region,” says Ken Ryan, director of business development and cargo, Chicago Rockford International Airport.

Joe Scandroli, president of Scandroli Construction, notes that flexibility from the building manufacturer and installer Rubb Building Systems helped the project stay on schedule.

Monumental Doors for the Mammoth Hangar

The Rockford facility’s two insulated membrane-clad hangars measure 300 feet long with a 300-foot clear span and 40-foot sidewalls, culminating in a center height of 100 feet. Each structure has five-panel, vertical-lift Assa Abloy Megadoors with pivoting mullions, allowing for housing of aircraft as large as the Airbus A380. The hot-dip galvanized steel frame is clad with two-inch-thick Thermohall insulated fabric. Expected maintenance costs are very low.

The vertical lifting Megadoor with its exceptional seals allows the facility to be climate controlled cost effectively year round. Complimenting the curved membrane structure, the Megadoor’s translucent fabric will also allow natural light in, creating a great work environment for the technicians, while minimizing lighting costs.

The Rockford structure represents a high point in Rubb Buildings Systems history in highly efficient membrane clad commercial aviation hangars. According to Chuck Auger, Rubb USA’s marketing manager, “Rockford is a step change in hangar efficiency, also being our largest hangar ever. The proof will become clear with service and repair productivity, as well as energy efficiency.”

Auger adds, “Rubb and Assa Abloy Megadoor have historically worked well together on numerous projects. Rubb’s robust frame structure and superior engineering supports even the most enormous Megadoor applications. Though Megadoor (and Rubb) ostensibly seem more costly, in reality the reduced building footprint and eave height (big savings) along with energy recovery efficiency, make Megadoor the most cost-effective hangar door option. The quality of Megadoor in combination with Rubb’s superior framing design makes the actual cost of door operations the lowest in the market, thereby saving the customer a lot of money in the long run.”

According to Pierre Varmaloff, Megadoor sales, “The vertical lifting Megadoors with exceptional seals allow the facility to be climate controlled cost effectively year round. Complimenting the curved membrane structure roof, our translucent fabric will allow natural light in, contributing to a great work environment for the technicians, while minimizing lighting costs.”

Continues Varmaloff, “MRO design should not be about housing aircraft, but quickly servicing planes to get them back in the air. Megadoors are all about reliability, saving time and money for facility operators, and increasing customer satisfaction. When workers have an optimal environment, this shows up in their work.”

Almost in Moth Balls

Only months ago, the project seemed destined for postponement due to financial issues amongst governmental authorities. Thankfully, five local community banking institutions got together to find a way to fast track a $17 million line of credit kept the project moving forward.

Polsean notes, “The entire project was in jeopardy and could easily have been stopped. Without the banks coming together, we would have been dead in the water. The real winner is the local economy and commercial aviation, having a strategically located high-tech facility. More cargo will be a wonderful additional benefit.”

According to the Illinois governor’s office, AAR is the largest operator of maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities in the U.S. The 200,000 square-foot facility is expected to operate 24 hours a day and will greatly expand the airport’s infrastructure. According to the governor’s office, AAR chose Rockford due to its central geographical location, highly trained workforce, cost effectiveness and access to a robust warehouse and distribution network. Rockford is also a hub for aerospace and aviation technology, with Boeing, Woodward, UTC Aerospace Systems and GE Aviation all having facilities nearby. Just down the street Rock Valley College is starting an aviation maintenance technology school, which will train mechanics qualified to work at the facility. Rock Valley College is a publically funded institution, which will provide a highly trained workforce to the MRO facility at an affordable cost of tuition, another benefit to the local economy.

""Poland considers the negotiations with Airbus Helicopters on an offset agreement related to the contract to purchase multi-purpose helicopters to be terminated. The contractor did not present an offset agreement that would sufficiently secure the economic interest and security of the Polish state,"" the Development Ministry said in a statement.



The statement said the procurement was estimated to be worth about 13.5 billion zloty (US $3.5 billion).





""The value of a proposed offset agreement should total at least this amount,"" the Development Ministry said.

The latest move indicates that Poland will most likely revise the previous cabinet’s decision from April 2015 to award a deal for 70 Caracals to Airbus Helicopters.

The Defence Ministry aims to hand the largest possible share of procurements to companies that produce their gear in Poland, and both companies own production facilities here. Polish Defence Minister Antoni Macierewicz has said that the ministry is considering the purchase of Black Hawk and AW149 helos from Lockheed Martin and Leonardo, respectively. Lockheed Martin’s subsidiary PZL Mielec makes the Black Hawk, while Leonardo’s PZL Swidnik offshoot produces the AW149.

The Development Ministry said that the government’s priority is to ""guarantee the security of the state and ensure sufficient conditions for the development of the Polish defense industry.""

Macierewicz is expected in November to present the priorities of Poland’s updated Technical Modernization Plan for the Polish Armed Forces to the parliament's National Defense Committee.

Some 250 flight hours have been logged on the type from Airbus Helicopters’ Marignane, France, headquarters. “Performance goals have been met or exceeded,” said Olivier Michalon, head of global sales for the type. Vibration on the prototypes is said to be particularly low. One factor contributing towards this is the optimized height flight-test pilots and engineers have chosen for the main rotor mast.

The engine seems to be contributing to the satisfactory development. Safran Helicopter Engines is confident the 1,100-1,1300 shaft horsepower Arrano 1A will be 100 percent “on specification” at entry into service. “We are on target, or better, for power and fuel burn,” said Maxime Faribault, Safran Helicopter Engines’ executive vice president for OEM sales. Engine certification will happen “six months prior to helicopter certification,” he predicted.

An undisclosed number of letters of intent have been signed for the H160. They are to be converted to firm orders from 2017, “when we a have a good level of confidence in performance and price,” Michalon explained. Interest is coming from “all segments – oil-and-gas, EMS, VIP, homeland security etc.” Pilots working for customers and prospective customers were recently allowed to fly a prototype.

A major objective is maturity at entry into service. This was also a focus for the H175’s launch in 2014, with Airbus’ first “operational maturity campaign” before the type’s entry into service. This time, the airframer expects to do even better thanks to the new “system helicopter zero” and “dynamic helicopter zero” integrated test beds. However, the first H160 delivery, once anticipated in 2018, has slipped to 2019, Michalon said.

The aeromechanical configuration was validated in late July. A third prototype is scheduled to join the flight-test program next year.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6679748892784119}",positive,0.6679748892784119,1

When Airbus’ Beluga XL oversize cargo airlifter enters service, it will have the same visual appeal as its well-loved predecessor – the A300-600ST Super Transporter, more commonly known as the Beluga ST – thanks to the design of its nose and main cargo door.The whale-like face that earned the original Beluga its nickname is iconic – however it wasn’t always certain this distinctive feature would be carried over to the new-generation Beluga XL, which was launched in 2014 based on Airbus’ highly-versatile A330 jetliner. In contrast, the A300-600ST is derived from the company’s shorter-fuselage A300.Favourable aesthetics played no major role in the Beluga XL’s “facial” design, rather it was a combination of cost targets and payload and ground infrastructure requirements. ""To avoid excessive development costs, we re-use the nose landing gear from our base aircraft, the A330,” said Yael Marion, nose fuselage and main cargo door programme leader at STELIA Aerospace – which is one of the aircraft’s major aerostructure suppliers. “This impacts the cockpit position, which is even lower than on the current Beluga ST.”This was a real challenge, but Marion is confident his team’s work packages will be ready on time to feed the Toulouse, France final integration line. ""There is still some way to go, but we're all proud of our achievements so far,"" Marion added. ""At the end of August 2016, more than 50 per cent of the elementary parts had been built and 15 per cent of the assembly had been completed.""This on-schedule development was underscored by Bertrand George, Head of Beluga XL programme, who said that Beluga XL assembly activity on the final integration line should begin by the end of 2016.Starting in mid-2019, the Beluga XL will gradually replace the existing five-member Beluga ST fleet – which is used for carrying complete sections of Airbus aircraft from different production sites around Europe to the final assembly lines in Toulouse, France and Hamburg, Germany. The fleet had 5,000 total flight hours in 2012 and that number is projected to be 10,000 in 2017.Hervé Demoinet, who is leading the team preparing the Beluga XL for entry into service, noted that the Belugas – both the ST and XL – will play a major role in future production ramp-ups. ""Both versions will operate in parallel for a while, but we'll begin phasing out the ST by the end of 2020,"" he says.

Composite materials: the here and now

The first A350 XWB lower wing cover is shown inside Airbus’ composites manufacturing site in Spain

Thirty-two metres long by six metres wide. That’s the size of the wing for the A350-1000, making it the largest single part made from carbon fibre composite material in civil aviation. Twenty percent lighter than aluminium, no corrosion, no fatigue, less maintenance: the advantages are clear.

It’s why, in total, more than 50% of Airbus’ latest jetliner is made from composite materials. It’s also why Airbus Helicopters has created the H160, the world’s first fully composite civil rotorcraft, which is set to enter service in 2018.

From metals to carbon fibre

Not long ago, passenger aircraft were made predominantly from metals such as steel and aluminium, but the pressure to reduce weight is leading to a greater adoption of other materials, particularly carbon fibre composites.

In the past, these materials were expensive and time-consuming to produce, and were mainly found in small aircraft parts and lower-volume products such as military planes and satellites.

“Despite its obvious advantages over metals, there is still a higher degree of manual labour involved, while the material costs are also greater,” explains Christian Weimer, head of composite materials & processes at Airbus Innovations. “But the tipping point in terms of economical large-volume manufacturing is getting ever nearer.”

Driving this change are innovative automated production facilities, like the Airbus Illescas plant in Spain. When it first opened 25 years ago, workers at the facility could lay around 3kg of carbon fibre composite. Now, it produces 34kg per hour.



Partnering with the automotive industry

To ensure progress on aerospace composite materials production continues, Christian Weimer’s Airbus Innovations team is constantly searching for further improvements.

“We’re starting to work more with the automotive sector, sharing information with the likes of BMW and Audi. They have different quality and performance demands as aerospace, but they can provide interesting insights into high-volume manufacturing and maybe even new composite structural design approaches"" says Christian Weimer.

Silicon carbide – Lightweight space explorer

Airbus Defence and Space's unique expertise in the field of silicon carbide is revolutionising space optics while expanding Europe’s technology base.

The largest mirrors in space

“It started in the 1990s: astronomical telescopes were becoming larger and we needed a new material to reduce the mirror weight,” explains Airbus Defence and Space’s Emmanuel Sein.

The answer was silicon carbide: lighter than metal or glass, it can be optically polished making it perfect for high performance lightweight mirrors. It also has excellent structural stability and thermal properties: vital for the accuracy of a telescope when temperatures in space plummet to -240°C.

New frontiers with Herschel

Having recognised the potential, Airbus Defence and Space (Airbus DS) joined together with French ceramic material specialist Mersen to form Boostec. “Our partner had experience in manufacturing small silicon carbide parts, but we were looking at dimensions of three metres or more,” says Sein.

After successfully completing a high-precision silicon carbide camera for the Rosetta mission, Airbus DS then built the Herschel Space Observatory for the European Space Agency (ESA), launched in 2009.

“The primary mirror is the largest single space telescope mirror in the world, 3.5 metres in diameter and weighing approximately 300 kg ,” says Sein. “If it had been built with standard optical materials instead of advanced aerospace materials, the mass would have been three tonnes.”

The shape of telescopes to come

Using this same expertise, Airbus DS has also built the Gaia spacecraft, launched in 2013 and made almost entirely from silicon carbide. It has the most sensitive telescope ever made and is currently gathering data for a 3D map of our galaxy.

Airbus DS is now working on part of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which will launch in 2018. The company is building its NIRSpec ‘super eye’, a 200kg spectrograph made entirely from silicon carbide that will be able to detect the faintest radiation from the most distant galaxies.

Furthermore, Airbus DS is manufacturing the complete payload module of ESA’s Euclid mission, which incorporates a 1.2 metre-diameter telescope made from silicon carbide. This instrument will map and investigate the nature of dark energy and dark matter in the universe.

3D printing in space – Be AMAZEd

Thanks to its involvement in the European AMAZE project, Airbus is helping refine 3D printing techniques. The goal: mass-produced parts that could transform space manufacturing.



First on the scene

There aren’t many 3D printed parts in space, but Airbus Defence and Space (Airbus DS) has already established itself as a pioneer in this area of growing importance. The very first 3D printed component to make it beyond the Earth’s atmosphere was a high-strength titanium alloy bracket on-board the Atlantic Bird 7 telecoms satellite made by Airbus DS in 2011.

In 2015, Airbus DS announced the production of the first space-qualified aluminium 3D printed component for its Eurostar E3000 satellite. The part weighs 35% less than the one it replaced, with an increase in stiffness of 40%. It cannot be manufactured using conventional methods.

But despite such impressive specifications, large-scale 3D printing is not yet a reality for space materials. “We must first be able to prove the repeatability of 3D processes and our ability to consistently produce high-quality, affordable components,” explains Telecommunications Satellites R&D Manager Alan Cox.



One step closer

Enter AMAZE. Led by the European Space Agency (ESA), the project unites 28 partners across industry and academia, including Airbus. Its goal is to refine 3D printing techniques to make the mass production of space-grade metal parts a reality.

“Today we use multiple 3D technologies. Within AMAZE, for each technique, we are working on isolating factors that could negatively impact the quality of produced parts,” explains Martin Muir, Research Engineer at Airbus Innovations in the UK and contributor to the project. “Learning how to control those parameters will take us a step closer to mass-producing 3D printed parts.”

Muir expects the benefits of the AMAZE project to extend much further, though: “The pooled wealth of knowledge is enabling the project to proceed incredibly well, with applications extending well beyond aerospace.”



From metals to carbon fibre

Not long ago, passenger aircraft were made predominantly from metals such as steel and aluminium, but the pressure to reduce weight is leading to a greater adoption of other materials, particularly carbon fibre composites.

In the past, these materials were expensive and time-consuming to produce, and were mainly found in small aircraft parts and lower-volume products such as military planes and satellites.

“Despite its obvious advantages over metals, there is still a higher degree of manual labour involved, while the material costs are also greater,” explains Christian Weimer, head of composite materials & processes at Airbus Innovations. “But the tipping point in terms of economical large-volume manufacturing is getting ever nearer.”

3D printing goes to the Moon

Instead of sending materials to space, why not use local resources? Architecture firm Foster and Partners, in conjunction with ESA, is exploring the possibilities of 3D printing to construct lunar habitations using regolith, or lunar soil, as building matter.

Barry Eccleston, president of Airbus Americas, and Mike Sinnett, VP of Product Strategy for Boeing, each said there is no consensus yet among customers for the Middle of the Market airplane (MOMA), also known as the New Mid-range Airplane (NMA) at Boeing.

Eccleston was interviewed on the sidelines of the annual Seattle conference organized by the British American Business Council Pacific Northwest. Sinnett was interviewed on the sidelines of the annual Governor’s Conference organized by the Aerospace Futures Alliance, a lobbying group in Washington State.

The product gap

Boeing arguably faces a more critical position in its product line than Airbus. The 737-900ER/9 represents less than 10% of 737 sales and orders compare poorly against the competing Airbus A321ceo/neo.

Some analysts believe the Boeing 787-8 will go away by about 2020 or 2021 and the MOM aircraft would be a replacement for the 788 as well as the remaining Boeing 767s. Boeing is studying a stretched 737-9 into a MAX 10 to boost 737 sales and compete with the A321’s greater capacity.

Officials said repeatedly they favor selling the 787-9/10 over the 787-8, but deny they will discontinue the 788. Still, sales and delivery data appear to support the thesis that the 787-8 won’t have a future beyond 2020.

Thus, Boeing’s product gap clearly begins with the 737-9 and ends with the 787-9.

Airbus claims the A321neo and its LR long range version cover the lower end of the MOM sector and the A330-200/800 fills the upper end.

Aligned on MOMA/NMA

The NMA seems to be evolving into a 4,000nm-5,000nm airplane in 2-3-2 coach 767

replacement. Or so it appears.

But Eccleston and Sinnett, in the separate interviews, say this isn’t so, yet.

“If your objective is to replace a 767, there is no single point the airlines are converging on,” Eccleston said. “Is it 4,000 miles? Is it 5,000 miles? Is it single aisle or twin aisle? If you talk to Airline A in the US, he wants a single aisle. He wants twin aisle economics but in a single aisle airplane. If you talk to Airline B, he wants a twin-aisle because he wants to go 5,000 miles and he wants a versatile airplane. If you talk to Airline C, ‘I just want the lowest cost, whatever that is.’

“There is no convergence in the airlines I am talking to. I think the same is [true] in Europe as well. There is no convergence that says ‘this’ is truly the Middle of the Market spec.”

“I would say we’re studying a market space as opposed to replacing a specific airplane,” Sinnett said in his interview. “There are aspects of the market space that look like missions that some 767s have done and there are some aspects of that market space that 757s have done.

“Technologies and configurations allow us to create a configuration that can do some of each of those missions. The hard part will be defining specifically with our customers where the market is and which of all the different needs is most important so we know where to optimize,” Sinnett said.

“I wouldn’t think of it as a 757 replacement or a 767 replacement. It’s really more of a study about that market space and trying to figure out what configuration best meets the market requirements. There are different ways to do it and we’re still in the process of talking to our customers and figure out what they need.

“Then, we have to figure out is that something that hunts.

“We haven ‘t said specifically it’s going to be this configuration or that,” said Sinnett.

Airbus likes what it has

While Boeing continues to evaluate what an NMA should be, Eccleston says Airbus is positioned just fine.

“We’re perfectly happy doing what we’re doing right now. The 321LR is finding a lot of market success and a lot of market interest. If you want to replace a 757, the 321LR does exactly the same job. It has the same range and the same number of passengers, but you’re doing it 30% cheaper,” he said.

(Some US airlines disagree, pointing out that in their configuration, the A321LR carriers slightly fewer passengers than the 757.)

“In that circumstance, we’re very happy with the success the 321LR is achieving. There is still a lot more we can do with the single-aisle airplane,” Eccleston said.

If there is one thing the industry has taught us in the last several years, it’s a really good idea to take an existing platform and improve it rather than do a clean sheet airplane.

Although Airbus claims the A330-200/800, and the A330-200 light gross weight Regional version, cover the upper end of the MOM sector, there have only been 10 sales of the -800 since it was launched. A330-200 standard sales have dried up as airlines move to the larger A330-300. The A330-200R sold about 150 two China and to a European carrier, but that’s it.

“I’m not the least bit worried about that because I know what the airlines are talking to us about,” Eccleston said. “When you start talking about a 767 replacement, certainly here in North America, people recognize the A330 is reliable, it’s fuel efficient and it’s cheaper than the 787 and oh, by the way, it has the same payload and range. It’s the closest thing the world has today to the 767 replacement.”

What about tomorrow?

If airlines like the A330 today, he obvious question is what about tomorrow?

“Suppose Boeing or we decide to make a new Middle of the Market airplane. If we could actually agree on what that is, it is probably going to need an engine that is 50,000 lbs thrust. Don’t tell me 45, because the airplane is only going to grow, it’s going to need more thrust. It’s going to need 50 on day one anyway and probably more than that to grow over the life of the program,” said Eccleston.

“How many proven 50,000 lb thrust turbo fan or unducted fan engines are there right now? Do you think there will be by 2025, given the engine business today?

“A 50,000 lb engine with a gear box in the middle of it is a lot of shaft horsepower and a lot of heat. That’s an engineering challenge of a magnitude beyond producing a 30,000 lb engine. I think 2025 is probably a little aggressive to me. Twenty 27 is probably still a little aggressive. Twenty 30 maybe, but by then maybe you have an unducted fan anyway.

“The point is, none of have an engine to build an airplane around even if you could figure out what the airplane is.”

737 MAX 10

Boeing is studying a stretch of the MAX 9 to support 737 sales and to counter the sales success of the A321neo, which is slightly larger than the MAX 9. Boeing continues to study various iterations and has been talking with customers for the better part of a year about this airplane.

One possibility is to use either the CFM LEAP-1A used on the Airbus A321neo or the LEAP-1C designed for the COMAC C919 in place of the 737’s LEAP-1B. The larger 1A or 1C requires taller landing gear and other changes.

The 1B probably needs more thrust, in the form of a thrust bump on take-off, but an iteration Boeing is looking at uses no thrust bump.

“We’re looking at a couple of things,” Sinnett told LNC. “We haven‘t arrived at a hard configuration yet because we’re still talking to customers. There are versions we can do that’s a stretch. There are versions we can do that don’t require a thrust bump. We’re trying to figure out where the sweet spot is. I think we’re pretty close. We’re not ready to talk about what that is yet. But there are a number of different options. We haven’t figured out if there is going to be a thrust bump or not.”

Eccleston’s view of what the MAX 10 should be is notable.

“If you had asked me back at Farnborough [Air Show], my personal guess as an industry observer is that the MAX 10 would take our LEAP engine with a larger fan and crank up and articulate the landing gear, stretch the airplane and call it the 10-and-a-half, or call it whatever you want to call it,” he said. “To me, that would make the only viable, affordable option that Boeing could have that might approach the 321neo and LR.

“To me, a simple stretch of the MAX 9 with the same engine, that engine is going to be awfully, awfully stretched. It’s already running pretty hot with that small fan. I don’t see that as being attractive to the airlines I’m talking to anyway, to make it a 757 replacement and put it on the Atlantic. I just don’t see it.”

Airbus is ready to respond

But if necessary, Eccleston said Airbus is ready to respond.

“We have a suite of improvements for the 320, and when the time comes, we’re ready to start bringing those in,” he said.

The market often talks about an “A322,” a slightly stretched A321 with a new wing and larger engines that truly becomes an unrestricted trans-Atlantic aircraft with greater capacity than the 757 in international configuration that includes lie-flat seats.

Airbus COO Customers John Leahy refers to an “A321 Plus,” without detailing what this will be.

Eccleston declined to offer details about the “suite” of options available to Airbus.

The industry may not have to wait long to see what direction will be taken. Observers expect Boeing to decide before the end of this year what the MAX 10 will be and the program will be launched.

Then Airbus can decide what it will do.

Airbus to overtake Boeing on aircraft output rates by 2020: CEO tells paper - Business Insider,"Sun, 16 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vci1haXJidXMtdG8tb3ZlcnRha2UtYm9laW5nLW9uLWFpcmNyYWZ0LW91dHB1dC1yYXRlcy1ieS0yMDIwLWNlby10ZWxscy1wYXBlci0yMDE2LTEw0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9yLWFpcmJ1cy10by1vdmVydGFrZS1ib2Vpbmctb24tYWlyY3JhZnQtb3V0cHV0LXJhdGVzLWJ5LTIwMjAtY2VvLXRlbGxzLXBhcGVyLTIwMTYtMTA_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A visitor looks at Airbus's A380 flight model during Japan Aerospace 2016 air show in Tokyo Thomson Reuters

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European aircraft maker Airbus aims to overtake arch rival Boeing in terms of annual plane deliveries by 2020, having fallen behind in recent years, Chief Executive Fabrice Bregier said in a German newspaper interview published on Monday.

""In 2020 we will deliver more planes than Boeing again,"" Fabrice told the Welt daily newspaper.

While Airbus has been leading in terms of new orders for years, its American rival has been ahead since 2012 in terms of deliveries.

Bregier said Airbus would particularly focus on its A320 neo narrowbody and A350 widebody planes.

He said that Airbus was hopeful it would deliver 50 A350 aircraft this year, although deliveries by the end of September stood at only 26.

Airbus Announces Plan for a Vertical Takeoff Plane by 2020 - Popular Mechanics,"Fri, 21 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHVsYXJtZWNoYW5pY3MuY29tL2ZsaWdodC9hMjM0OTcvYWlyYnVzLXZlcnRpY2FsLXRha2VvZmYtcGxhbmUtMjAyMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has announced its plans enter the vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft market by 2020, showcasing a bold new design for a plane being created under the name Vahana.

Vahana marks the first major venture of A³ (which Airbus pronounces as A-cubed). It's the Silicon Valley outpost of the European aerospace giant. In a Medium post, A³ CEO Rodin Lysaoff describes a plane built for a single passenger that ""doesn't need a runway, is self-piloted, and can automatically detect and avoid obstacles and other aircraft.""

Airbus has already completed the design, which looks like helicopter chopped in half with eight rotors on two wings. The wings could tilt, allowing for the plane to move around both vertically and horizontally.

Airbus The Airbus Vahana vertical lift

While Lysaoff promises ""many critical subsystems"" have been developed or procured, much of the crucial work for the plane is incomplete. Chief among these concerns is energy—specifically, the batteries that will power Vahana in the air. Airbus then to develop the self-piloting software, as well as avoidance technology for a self-piloted plane in crowded airspace. Lysaoff has told the Airbus Group in-house magazine Forum that these technologies ""are most of the way there,"" and hopes to get a prototype off the ground by 2017 with something sellable by 2020.

""You quickly realize that the potential demand corresponds to about 100 times the yearly production of Airbus Helicopters.""

One thing Airbus does not believe it will have to worry about is a market. Uber has declared its interest in the VTOL market, and Airbus believes that they can supply the tech while the ride-sharing service provides the customers. ""You quickly realize that the potential demand corresponds to about 100 times the yearly production of Airbus Helicopters,"" says Jörg Müller from the Airbus Group's corporate development department, speaking to Forum. ""This would only require replacing one out of a hundred ground taxis.""

Airbus An artist\'s conception of the CityAirbus

Airbus is also working on a larger flying vehicle deemed CityAirbus that could transport multiple people.""Customers use an app to book a seat on a CityAirbus, proceed to the nearest helipad, and climb aboard to be whisked away to their destination,"" Forum says. The company imagines that the ""sharing economy principle"" would make these flights affordable. There is no set timeline for CityAirbus.

Between the two projects, Airbus Group is aggressively taking on VTOL travel. ""I'm no big fan of Star Wars,"" says CEO Tom Enders, ""but it's not crazy to imagine that one day our big cities will have flying cars making their way along roads in the sky.""

By pooling naval and aerospace skills and expertise, the teaming of DCNS and Airbus Helicopters will be equipped to address all technical challenges arising from the naval integration of the drones through the creation of a robust system architecture that can evolve and adapt to meet every need.

Ten years of experience

For DCNS, drones are the roving eyes of the battle system; their missions are overseen by each ship’s combat management system, ensuring increased effectiveness in real time in support of naval operations. Offering a genuine tactical advantage, the vertical take off and landing (VTOL) drone is an organic component of warships and augments the operational potential of naval forces.

DCNS CEO Hervé Guillou said: “We will continue to innovate in these areas and give drones the capability to perform increasingly complex missions over greater distances and timeframes in an interoperable environment with increased digitalisation of resources. Such digitalization hinges on the roll-out of cybersecurity solutions that offer better protection of data and communications between drones and ships.”

DCNS’s role in the partnership will be to design and supply the entire warship-integrated VTOL drone system. DCNS will design and develop the solutions for the ship-based operation and integration of the drone, including the specification and validation of the payloads and mission data links. DCNS will also produce the drone’s mission system, which will enable real-time management of its operations and allow its payloads to be controlled through the combat management system.

Over the last 10 years, DCNS has successfully overseen the French armaments procurement agency (DGA) and French Navy’s main aerial drone study and trial programs, operating both on its own and in partnership. In the process, the group has acquired know-how that is unique in Europe and possesses solutions for integrating aerial drone systems in warships or enabling them to operate on ships. These solutions have been tested at sea.

The VSR 700: a multi-faceted and robust solution

A versatile and affordable platform, the VSR700 has been developed by Airbus Helicopters with a view to providing military customers with a solution that leverages a tried and tested civil aircraft and strikes the best possible balance between performance, operational flexibility, reliability and operating costs.

Harnessing autonomous flight technologies that have been tested by Airbus Helicopters through a range of demonstration programs, the VSR700 is derived from a light civil helicopter, the Cabri G2 (developed by the company Hélicoptères Guimbal), which has proven its reliability and low operating costs in service.

Under the terms of the partnership, Airbus Helicopters will be responsible for designing and developing the VSR700 drone as well as the various technologies needed for drones to perform aerial missions, such as data liaison, payload and a “see and avoid” capability enabling the drone’s integration into airspace.

“Rotary-wing drones will play a crucial role in tomorrow’s air/sea theatres of operation, performing the role of a roving eye and extending the coverage of surface vessels over the horizon,” said Airbus Helicopters CEO Guillaume Faury.

“This partnership will see Airbus Helicopters pool its expertise in vertical flight and autonomous flight technologies with the skills DCNS possesses in naval combat systems, allowing us to respond to the emerging needs of our customers.”

Thanks to the VSR700’s specifications, the system boasts superior endurance and payload performance to any comparable system used to date. The device offers big capability with a small size and logistics footprint, resulting in less maintenance and straight forward integration to a broad range of surface vessels.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9993543028831482}",positive,0.9993543028831482,1

A journey of 10000 aircraft and counting: Airbus' pioneering spirit and commitment to shaping the future - Airbus,"Fri, 14 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE2LTEwLWEtam91cm5leS1vZi0xMDAwMC1haXJjcmFmdC1hbmQtY291bnRpbmctYWlyYnVzLXBpb25lZXJpbmctc3Bpcml0LWFuZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Driven by a passion for aviation and a desire to create better ways to fly, the over-four-decade-long Airbus success story is now an achievement that spans 10,000 aircraft – from the A300 to the A350 XWB and beyond.

With the handover of an A350-900 to Singapore Airlines today, Airbus marked the 10,000th aircraft provided to worldwide customers since the aircraft manufacturer’s initial delivery in 1974. This accomplishment underscores the company’s ongoing growth that has transformed a European upstart in the 1970s to a global market leader now offering a modern and comprehensive product line ranging from 100 to more than 600 seats.

“Building and delivering 10,000 aircraft is a remarkable achievement and important step in our journey reflecting the hard work, dedication and creative thinking of Airbus employees past and present,” said Fabrice Brégier, Airbus President and CEO. “As we prepare for the future ahead, this spirit will continue to be a key part of our ongoing success.”

Continuous leadership

Deliveries of every Airbus “family” member have contributed to this milestone – from the cornerstone medium-haul A300 and A310 to the best-selling single-aisle A320 product line, long-range A330/340 Family, new-generation A350 XWB and double-deck A380.

Throughout Airbus’ history, these commercial aircraft have been connected by the shared values of continuous innovation, unmatched operational efficiency and superior comfort – characteristics which operators and passengers around the globe have firmly endorsed.

To date, the global Airbus fleet has performed more than 110 million total flights and flown some 215 billion kilometres (enough distance to travel from the Earth to the Sun some 1,500 times). Airbus aircraft have carried over 12 billion passengers in commercial service – a figure representing approximately twice the world’s population.

A record-breaking family of aircraft

Each member of Airbus’ product line also is a “record-breaker” – starting with the A300, the first widebody, twin-engine jetliner. The A320 Family currently holds the mark as the most common aircraft in commercial service, while the A330 Family last year flew more flights than any other widebody.

The A340 is the record holder for performing the longest-ever regularly scheduled non-stop passenger service: a 15,000-plus-km. fight between Changi Airport and Newark operated by Singapore Airlines. The A350 XWB is ready to follow in these footsteps with the A350-900 Ultra Long Range version, which Singapore Airlines has selected to resume service from Singapore to the New York area.

Rounding out Airbus’ record-breaking fleet is the A380, which is the largest aircraft in commercial service and flies eight of the 10 longest routes operating today.

Success that spans the globe

Deliveries of Airbus aircraft have been received by customers in all regions of the world – led by the Asia-Pacific and followed by Europe, North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and Africa, along with handovers to lessors, government and private jet operators.

In turn, Airbus has developed its production facilities on an international scale to increase capacity and remain even closer to customers. With expansions of its European manufacturing and final assembly sites, as well as the opening of new final assembly lines in the U.S. and China for the A320 Family, the sun never sets on Airbus’ network.

This growing global network is driving the company’s increase in production output – highlighted by the fact that Airbus’ 10,000th delivery is occurring just over a year and half after its 9,000th handover.

Shaping the future

At current production rates, Airbus expects to deliver its 20,000th aircraft in approximately a decade – taking about one fourth of the time to produce its second 10,000 jetliners as compared to the first 10,000.

Among these future deliveries will be a new generation of Airbus aircraft entering service – including such latest-launched products as the A320neo (new engine option), A330neo and A350 XWB. These aircraft are ready to once again help Airbus set new standards in air travel and carry the company’s success forward.

“Our desire to further transform the industry is undiminished,” said Didier Evrard, Airbus Executive Vice President – Head of Programmes. “We will continue to improve environmental performance, reduce noise, develop new services and enhance operational capabilities. We’ll strive to stay at the forefront when it comes to connected aircraft, passenger comfort, and adopting disruptive technologies”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999998807907104}",positive,0.9999998807907104,1
Airbus Corporate Jets brings new look to large-cabin design - Airbus,"Mon, 31 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNi0xMC1haXJidXMtY29ycG9yYXRlLWpldHMtYnJpbmdzLW5ldy1sb29rLXRvLWxhcmdlLWNhYmluLWRlc2lnbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

Cabin combines customer wishes with fresh design approach

The curved walls create a welcoming feel in the ACJ320neo Melody cabin’s lounge area, which contains a 65-inch curved television screen on one of the walls

Airbus Corporate Jets has combined its knowledge of customer preferences with a fresh approach to cabin design, creating a new cabin concept for its ACJ320neo Family.Called Melody, it features flowing lines inspired by the curves of nature, such as hilly horizons, rolling rivers and desert dunes. These flowing lines are represented in both the main pathway through the cabin and the curved walls of zones within it.The new concept also focuses on providing a more attractive environment that is both quieter and better adapted to providing sound and vision in a “home cinema” setting.“A key feature of Airbus corporate jets is the better travel experience that they deliver – through freedom of movement and enhanced sociability as well as their greater space and comfort – and the new Melody cabin highlights this benefit over traditional business jets,” declares Airbus Chief Operating Officer, Customers John Leahy.While each cabin designer has their own style, there are general principles that most follow, including to start by understanding how a corporate jet will be used, and the lifestyle, tastes and preferences of the customer.Airbus Corporate Jets’ Head of Creative Design & Concepts, Sylvain Mariat, capitalised on his many discussions with customers over the years – in hotels, homes and offices – to identify shared values, such as the relaxation drawn from nature and quiet and comfortable settings.He married these values with a forward-looking approach to create the Melody cabin for new aircraft, such as the ACJ320neo, deliveries of which will begin at the end of 2018.The combination also benefits from new technologies – such as weight-saving carbonfibre in tables and cabinets and the simplification that comes from greater use of wi-fi – to enable delivery of a lighter cabin, and hence to increase aircraft range.Airbus has already delivered an ACJ319 with these technologies which, with the addition of Sharklets, is already regularly flying from Asia to the US west coast.More than 180 Airbus corporate jets are in service around the world, flying with companies, individuals and governments on every continent, including Antarctica.* * *About Airbus Corporate JetsAirbus Corporate Jets (ACJ) create the world’s most rewarding flying experiences with customers by providing them with unique expertise, the finest service, best technology and highest standards of care in corporate aviation.All Airbus corporate jets come from the most modern aircraft family on the market.

Airbus Employees Are Being Scolded for Dressing Too Casually at Work - Fortune,"Thu, 13 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAxNi8xMC8xMy9haXJidXMtdW5pb25zLWNhc3VhbC1mcmlkYXkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An internal row has broken out after Airbus managers at a plant in Britain berated staff for dressing casually and spending too much time in the canteen, fueling tensions just as the aerospace group embarks on a new reorganization.

Workers at Filton, southwest England, were angered when they received a memo accusing some staff of slacking and setting out recent sartorial offenses including the wearing of “outlandish t-shirts”, shorts, football shirts and flip-flops.

The plant outside Bristol, a city divided by fierce loyalties to two rival soccer teams, is home to the wing design for Airbus passenger jets and wing manufacturing for Europe’s A400M military transporter.

The Anglo-French Concorde supersonic airliner was also partly developed and built at Filton, where the last Concorde to fly will be the centerpiece of a new museum.

While Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders has launched a campaign to borrow fresh thinking from high-tech industries to improve innovation, the group’s British workers have been told another Silicon Valley export—casual Friday—does not apply to them.

“Clearly we want to portray a professional image at all times but it appears that for some employees Fridays have become like the day before the start of the school holidays,” a managerial memo told Filton’s 4,000 workers.

It also rebuked some workers for making a beeline for the canteen within minutes of arriving for work, for staying there too long and for going home as early as 11 a.m. on Friday.

Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.

Four workers have been sacked, or “exited,” for failing to work allotted hours, according to the memo, seen by Reuters.

The 800-word memo struck a nerve at a time when unions are warning over the impact of a company reorganization that will see Airbus Group merge with its main Airbus (AIRBUS-GROUP-N-V) plane-making arm.

“The email went viral internally. There is a lot of resentment,” said a person familiar with the reaction.

A spokesman for Britain’s largest union, Unite, said the memo had caused protests from staff, which had now been resolved, although other sources said reverberations continued.

French unions are warning of job cuts due to the reorganization, though plane-making chief Fabrice Bregier has said it too early to predict these.

“Managers talk about voluntary departures but we worry about forced redundancies despite an order book worth a trillion dollars,” said Yvonnick Dreno of Force Ouvriere, a union.

Airbus also faces possible job reductions on its commercial helicopter and A380 lines due to weak demand.

It remains unclear how the shake-up will affect Britain, where Airbus could be helped by a slide in the pound as costs are translated to euros, but whose vote to leave the European Union has left uncertainty over long-term Airbus investments.

Airbus, which has said in the past its U.K. plants are among its most productive, declined detailed comment on the row.

“As a global leader in aeronautics, Airbus must maintain the highest level of professional standards, and we routinely have ongoing communications with our employees across a range of topics and issues,” a spokeswoman said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9990957975387573}",neutral,0.9990957975387573,0
Airbus Defence and Space completes first GRACE-FO satellite for NASA/JPL - Airbus,"Fri, 28 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE2LTEwLWFpcmJ1cy1kZWZlbmNlLWFuZC1zcGFjZS1jb21wbGV0ZXMtZmlyc3QtZ3JhY2UtZm8tc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWZvci1uYXNhanBs0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Defence and Space, the world’s second largest space company, has finished construction of the first of the two GRACE-FO (GRACE = Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, FO = Follow-On) satellites in Friedrichshafen, Germany. The satellite will now be transferred to Ottobrunn near Munich for several months of operational testing in the IABG test centre.

NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory JPL (Pasadena, California) will send both GRACE-FO research satellites into a polar orbit at an altitude of around 500 km and at a distance of 220 km apart. This is a follow-on to the GRACE mission, which has been successfully in operation since 2002. As they travel around the Earth, these satellites constantly take very exact measurements of their separation distance, which changes depending on the Earth’s gravity. In this way, scientists are able to map the Earth’s gravitational fields.

A global positioning system and a microwave ranging system enable the distance between the satellites to be measured to within one micron. The GRACE-FO satellites will feature an additional element: a new inter-satellite laser ranging instrument, developed by a German/American joint venture, which will be tested for use in future generations of gravitational research satellites.

Launch of the GRACE-FO twin satellites is planned for no earlier than late 2017. Over the course of the five-year mission, measurements will be taken to provide an updated model of the Earth’s gravitational fields every 30 days. In addition, each of the satellites will supply up to 200 profiles of temperature distribution and water-vapour content for the atmosphere and the ionosphere on a daily basis.

The second GRACE-FO satellite will be ready for testing in about four weeks.

GRACE-FO is a partnership between NASA and the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ).

Airbus to marshal its satellites against deforestation - Mongabay.com,"Wed, 12 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5tb25nYWJheS5jb20vMjAxNi8xMC9haXJidXMtdG8tbWFyc2hhbC1pdHMtc2F0ZWxsaXRlcy1hZ2FpbnN0LWRlZm9yZXN0YXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Starling is a new service developed by Airbus, The Forest Trust and SarVision.

Palm oil suppliers can use it to verify their compliance with their customers’ zero-deforestation policies.

Starling, which will be sold to companies, is meant as a compliment to Global Forest Watch, a publicly available platform that anyone can use to track deforestation in near-real time.

Starling is more powerful than Global Forest Watch, with the ability to see through clouds and zoom in close enough to count the trees.

One of the world’s largest aerospace companies is enlisting its satellites in the fight to save forests.

That’s the aim of Starling, a new service developed by Airbus Defence and Space, nonprofit The Forest Trust (TFT) and remote-sensing specialist SarVision.

Food giants Nestlé and Ferrero, two of the top users of palm oil — a ubiquitious commodity whose production has fueled economic growth but also deforestation in countries like Indonesia — hope Starling will help them clean up their vast supply networks. The two multinationals announced on Monday they would pilot the service before it hits the market in early 2017.

Despite a raft of pledges by major refiners and users of palm oil to purge their supply chains of forest and peatland destruction, none has yet managed to even identify the origins of everything it buys — an early prerequisite for any “mission accomplished” declaration by corporations who say they intend to “transform the industry.”

Starling alone will not enable them to do that. The big refiners obtain much of the palm fruit and oil they process from third parties, whose own suppliers (and suppliers’ suppliers, and suppliers’ suppliers’ suppliers) are often a mystery to the refiners themselves. This convolution is at the center of why the sector’s downstream giants — refiners like Wilmar International and Golden Agri-Resources; and consumer goods manufacturers like Nestlé and Ferrero — have been unable to map their supply chains to the plantation level, as promised.

What Starling will provide is a tool for good suppliers to show they are doing well — a potentially transformative step, according to TFT CEO Bastien Sachet.

Today, the big refiners appear to be doing little to actively monitor their suppliers’ compliance with their commitments. It is with startling ease that NGOs like Greenomics and Rainforest Action Network (RAN) are able to expose environmental destruction and labor abuses in their supply chains, which in some instances has pressed them to cut ties with errant firms.

The problem, said Sachet, is that the threat of punishment, while important, has been overemphasized to the point that the medium-sized companies responsible for much of the sector’s upstream activities — the growing and milling of palm fruit and oil, as opposed to the refinement of crude palm oil into chemicals used in everything from snack foods to cosmetics and laundry detergent — have been alienated from the movement to make the industry sustainable.

“This change journey is not controlled by the producers — it’s still controlled by the activist NGOs,” Sachet told Mongabay. “And that’s not sustainable; it cannot generate change in the long term.”

Even with the buyers and refiners pressing for a drastic change of course, “we have not succeeded in getting the mid-size companies to take ownership of that change journey,” he said. “And they are pushing back.”

Improved technology

The prospect of Starling prompts inevitable comparisons with Global Forest Watch (GFW), launched in 2014 by thinktank the World Resources Institute to enable monitoring of forests on a monthly basis.

The publicly available platform leverages Google’s computing power to make sense of staggering amounts of NASA satellite data; but it’s less precise than Starling, which can zoom in close enough to count the trees, and see through the clouds that so often blanket the tropics where oil palm is grown. Crucially, Starling updates every six to 10 days. And its advanced algorithms, pioneered by SarVision, allow it to distinguish between a greater variety of landscape types and features than GFW, which can struggle to tell a rainforest from a plantation.

The other difference is philosophical. While anyone with a laptop can log onto GFW — the platform is meant for journalists, conservationists and law enforcers as well as corporate officials — Starling is a business, available to companies that choose to pay for it. If an NGO like Greenpeace wants to investigate whether a grower is, say, demolishing rainforest outside of its concession, it must rely on lower-grade monitoring tools such as GFW or Google Earth.

“We would encourage all actors to work toward making the information public,” RAN agribusiness campaigner Gemma Tillack said in regard to Starling.

While the implementation of corporate zero-deforestation pledges, she told Mongabay, had so far been “disappointing,” with the destruction of forests and peatlands and the trampling of indigenous rights still routine, Starling could be “a very useful tool for supply-chain actors looking to implement their policies.”

“We’re calling on the [big refiners] as well as TFT to commit to radical transparency, which they talk about, and I think the availability of real-time data could be a valuable contribution,” Tillack said.

As TFT’s Sachet describes it, Starling is neither public nor transparent — at least not inherently. It will be up to the participating companies to decide whether to share their satellite reports. But Sachet believes suppliers will be “strongly incentivized” to do so. “‘Maybe I can get more market share, maybe I can be preferred by Wilmar as a grower’,” he ventured on behalf of potential Starling subscribers.

As Sachet suggests, a big refiner like Wilmar could theoretically insist that a supplier use the service to prove its operations are deforestation-free, or at least that it is moving in the right direction. But what action the Wilmars of the world would take against firms that refuse to do so is an open question. Civil society groups have often assailed downstream giants like Wilmar for failing to act against suppliers shown to be in breach of their policies.

The corporate counterargument generally goes that cutting ties with an errant company is the easy way out — better to work with the supplier to help it change for the better, or the deforestation will simply continue. Detractors of that view point to the huge market share of the top five or six refiners — as much as 80 percent, by some counts — all of which have committed to zero-deforestation, and which could theoretically act in tandem to enforce their policies with little fear of sending a supplier into a rival’s arms.

The refiners dispute that logic, pointing out that the governments of top palm oil producers Indonesia and Malaysia (or, certain influential officials within those governments) have worked to undermine their zero-deforestation goals, such as when the Indonesian anti-monopoly agency, egged on by the agriculture ministry, threatened to prosecute Wilmar and its competitors as a cartel.

Starling “doesn’t mean you can verify the whole supply chain tomorrow,” said Sachet. But “we believe it will prompt more visibility in the supply chain. It will prompt more dialogue.”

Airbus unveils concept for an autonomous electric VTOL aircraft - Electrek,"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZWxlY3RyZWsuY28vMjAxNi8xMC8yNC9haXJidXMtdW52ZWlscy1jb25jZXB0LWF1dG9ub21vdXMtZWxlY3RyaWMtdnRvbC1haXJjcmFmdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Electric and self-piloted aircraft might be coming sooner than you think. Competition is a great accelerator in bringing technologies to market and it seems like there’s never been that many companies in the field. Earlier this year, it was even revealed that Alphabet CEO Larry Page was financing two separate startups with over $100 million to compete in developing their own electric aircraft designs.

Now Airbus is also entering the race and unveiled its design for a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) electric and autonomous aircraft.

The vehicle program is called ‘Vahana’ and it is being developed by Airbus’ subsidiary A³ (pronounced “A-cubed”) based in Silicon Valley. A³’s CEO, Rodin Lyasoff, was formerly a Lead Engineer for Flight Software and Simulation at Zee Aero, one of the electric aircraft startups financed by Page.

Lyasoff briefly described the concept in a blog post:

“The aircraft we’re building doesn’t need a runway, is self-piloted, and can automatically detect and avoid obstacles and other aircraft. Designed to carry a single passenger or cargo, we’re aiming to make it the first certified passenger aircraft without a pilot.”

And he released two renderings of the concept:

They have a pretty aggressive timeline to production. They aim to fly a full-size working prototype before the end of 2017, and to have a scalable to production demonstrator by 2020.

Lyasoff sees several technological trends pointing toward manned electric and autonomous aircraft being feasible in the near future:

Battery safety and energy density are now adequate for airborne applications.

Low-cost, reliable avionics are becoming broadly available, leveraging decades of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) development.

Mature obstacle detection and avoidance technology can enable safe aircraft takeoff and landing, and provides reliable collision avoidance in flight.

Recent advances in automated composite manufacturing and assembly show that small, lightweight vehicles can be produced at high volumes and significantly lower costs than traditional aerospace methods have previously allowed.

"Orbital, Airbus team on Eutelsat satellite to launch with Orbital satellite-servicing mission - SpaceNews","Tue, 11 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9vcmJpdGFsLWFpcmJ1cy10ZWFtLXRvLWJ1aWxkLWV1dGVsc2F0LXNhdGVsbGl0ZS10by1sYXVuY2gtd2l0aC1vcmJpdGFsLXNhdGVsaWx0ZS1zZXJ2aWNpbmctbWlzc2lvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Satellite fleet operator Eutelsat on Oct. 11 said it had inaugurated its design-to-cost spending-reduction plan by ordering a direct-broadcast television satellite from Orbital ATK of the United States and Airbus Defence and Space of Europe.

In another cost-reduction measure, the satellite, Eutelsat 5 West B — benefiting from Orbital’s smaller platform size — will be launched in 2018 as a co-passenger aboard an International Launch Services (ILS) Proton Breeze-M rocket.

Riding to geostationary transfer orbit with the Eutelsat satellite will be Orbital’s precedent-setting satellite in-orbit serving Mission Extension Vehicle, MEV-1, which uses the same GEOStar-based platform as Orbital’s telecommunications satellites.

Eutelsat, in second ILS contract, is inaugural customer for new Proton Medium

In a separate announcement on Oct. 12, ILS and Eutelsat said Eutelsat would be the first customer to use the new Proton Medium vehicle, which is designed for all-commercial use for payloads weighing between 3,000 and 5,000 kilograms, which is below the nominal weight for a full-sized Proton. The Eutelsat satellite, which was not identified, will be launched in 2019 or 2020.

Stacking the savings on a single Proton

Stacking two GEOStar-derived platforms on top of each other, without an adaptor between them, saves weight and will allow Eutelsat — and Orbital, for the MEV-1 — to save on launch costs.

Fleet operator Intelsat is Orbital’s inaugural customer for MEV-1, which will perform a test mission with Intelsat before moving on to its operational scenario of docking with a satellite, assuming control of its propulsion and attitude control, and providing fuel to extend its service life.

MEV-1 then undocks and is available to perform similar mission-extension missions on several satellites. Like the satellites themselves, MEV-1 has an estimated 15-year service life.

Satellite insurers are taking a cautiously optimistic view of MEV-1 and similar satellite in-orbit servicing initiatives. They have said MEV-1 customers likely will be forced to sign amended, higher-premium insurance policies, which usually provide for annual coverage of healthy satellites in orbit, to reflect the higher risk associated with servicing missions.

Eutelsat 5 West B will replace the Eutelsat 5 West A satellite at 5 degrees west longitude. It will carry the equivalent of 35 36-megahertz Ku-band transponders to deliver direct-to-home television to audiences located mainly in France, Italy and Algeria.

Eutelsat 5A, which also carries a C-band payload, was launched in mid-2002 and is nearing retirement.

Eutelsat’s revenue and profit warning in May had a chilling effect on the entire fixed satellite services industry. The company said the market reaction was overblown and that growth would return within three years.

Nonetheless, Eutelsat announced a broad cost-cutting program that included a 16 percent reduction — to 420 million euros ($470 million) per year for the coming three years from the earlier 500 million euros — in annual capital spending for three years.

The company said it would be pressuring its supply chain, notably satellite builders and launch-service providers, to minimize the effects of the lower spending on new capacity to be placed into orbit.

Dulles, Virginia-based Orbital’s GEOStar platform occupies the lighter end of the commercial geostationary-orbit satellite market. Airbus said the Eutelsat 5 West B would have a launch mass of about 3,000 kilograms and would generate 5 kilowatts of power to the payload at the end of its 15-year life.

Eutelsat Chief Technology Officer Yohann Leroy said the idea to marry an Airbus payload with an Orbital-built platform emerged as the natural consequence of Eutelsat’s bid request, whose power specifications were below what Airbus usually provides to customers.

Other companies besides Orbital can build small geostationary-orbit communications satellite platforms, but none could offer the relatively seamless stacking option to save on the launch costs that comes from having two nearly identical satellite skeletal structures as passengers.

Leroy said Oct. 10 that Eutelsat looked at the total cost of ownership of the 5 West B program, including launch cost. Eutelsat in late 2015 signed a Multi-Launch Agreement with Reston, Virginia-based ILS, which markets Russia’s Proton rocket.

Proton was coming off a string of failures that had tarnished its reputation among commercial satellite owners. Eutelsat said at the time that its agreement with ILS was done in part to ensure that at least three rockets remained regularly available to the commercial market. The other two are the Arianespace-provided Ariane 5 and the SpaceX Falcon 9.

The combination of previously negotiated cost reductions in the Multi-Launch Agreement and the ability to essentially cut launch costs in half by sharing a Proton mission have resulted in “substantial savings,” Leroy said. He declined to be specific.

After 15 years of operations of the 5 West A satellite, Eutelsat has been able to reduce the coverage for the successor spacecraft based on the customer set that has developed over the years in France, Italy and Algeria. The successor satellite thus needs less power to serve the customer base, and does not need the C-band capacity aboard 5 West A.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999971389770508}",neutral,0.9999971389770508,0

French fury as Poland ditches billion euro Airbus helicopter deal - FRANCE 24 English,"Tue, 11 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi8yMDE2MTAxMS1mcmVuY2gtZnVyeS1haXJidXMtcG9sYW5kLWhlbGljb3B0ZXItZGVhbC11c2EtZXXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FRANCE - POLAND

France-based Airbus hit back on Tuesday at Poland’s decision to cancel a multi-billion-euro military helicopter deal, deepening a bitter row that is threatening to turn into a full international diplomatic incident between Paris and its NATO ally.

In an open letter to the country’s prime minister, Europe's largest aerospace group accused Warsaw of shifting the goalposts and disregarding European Union regulations.

Airbus Group Chief Executive Tom Enders accused Poland of misleading the company during negotiations and threatened further action.

“Never have we been treated by any government customer the way this government has treated us,” Enders said in a statement, hours after Polish Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz revealed that it would buy Black Hawk helicopters from US defence giant Lockheed Martin and that Leonardo-Finmeccanica SpA of Italy could also expect orders. Both firms are major Airbus Helicopters rivals.

Poland later added the Black Hawk helicopters would be made in Poland by the US defence firm. Poland’s defence minister said the helicopters would be made at the Polish factory of Sikorsky Aircraft Corp, a unit of US Lockheed Martin Corp.

Industry sources estimated that the cost to Airbus of running the sales campaign for the helicopters at tens of millions of euros.

“The controversial and contradictory declarations of the Polish government over the course of the procurement proceedings created the impression of unprecedented confusion,” the Airbus boss stated.

Enders added that his company will seek “remedies,” he said, without providing further details.

Polish interest before the EU

Poland’s previous centrist government, which was beaten by rightist Law and Justice (PiS) party in elections last October, had provisionally agreed with Airbus to buy 50 of its Caracal multi-role helicopters in April 2015 as part of efforts to modernise its military amid regional tensions over Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine that year.

In the beginning of October, the new government, which had promised to put Poland’s national interests ahead of the wider European Union, said it was scrapping the Airbus contract.

France reacted furiously, saying Paris would review defence cooperation with Poland and promptly cancelled a presidential visit to Warsaw.

Polish government officials hit back stating that Airbus had had ample notice to adjust its offer, which they said was not satisfactory.

“I would like to explain that the government hasn’t broken the negotiations but ended them when we became certain continuing them made no sense,” Radoslaw Domagalski-Labedzki, a deputy economy minister, told reporters.

Polish jobs

Despite Airbus arguing that their offer would create of 3,800 local jobs and generate more value for Poland than for the European company itself, Poland was dismissive.

Speaking at a press conference in a helicopter repair factory in the city of Lodz, Prime Minister Beata Szydlo said her government wanted the army to be equipped by Polish-made kit.

“We are doing what is being done by all other countries which protect national interests,” Szydlo said. “For Poland, it is important we buy equipment here, in Poland.”

Concessions at the 11th hour

Lifting the lid on the typical, but usually highly-secretive world surrounding defence contracts which include shadowy economic trade-offs or “offsets”, Airbus Helicopters chief executive Guillaume Faury said the decision to cancel the deal came a day after Airbus had offered new concessions.

He said Airbus Helicopters had offered offsets worth 100% of the helicopters.

He also said the Polish ministry of economy had slapped an additional 23 percent in value-added tax (VAT) on the deal, bringing the overall value to 3.2 billion euros.

“Although compensation of a value-added tax through offset is not standard practice, Airbus Helicopters agreed to compensate this gross value,” the letter said.

He said the ministry also introduced other new requirements in August, some of which Airbus had been unable to meet because they contravened European Union laws.

Airbus said the deal would have led to the transfer of 45 items of security-sensitive technology and provided 30 years of work for state-owned companies, modernising an industry depending on servicing “old-generation Russian helicopters”.

Airbus Helicopters’ Faury also claimed Airbus had gone further than its rivals, Lockheed Martin’s Sikorsky and Italy’s Leonardo in offering a state-owned assembly plant.

Developed and assembled locally by Helibras, Airbus Helicopters’ subsidiary in Brazil, this new H225M version is designed to meet the demanding requirements of the Brazilian Navy, with mission capabilities including anti-surface warfare and maritime surveillance.

This evolution of the H225M is built around a Helibras-developed tactical mission system including an APS-143 surveillance radar, advanced self-protection systems as well as signals intelligence capabilities.

The helicopter is also equipped with two AM39 Exocet anti-ship missiles, while the cargo bay accommodates a dedicated sensor operator console providing the mission commander with an overview of the tactical situation. An automatic identification system (AIS) will also allow crew members to gather information on surface vessels.

“I am particularly proud to present this new version”, said Helibras president Richard Marelli. “This latest and unique version of the H225M is a testimony of the hard work our teams have been doing here in Brazil in close collaboration with Brazilian military customers. It also demonstrates our ability to effectively transfer technology, skills and know-how to Brazil, and our commitment to support the development of the country’s aerospace industry”.

The helicopter unveiled this week in Itajubá will be the first H225M in naval combat version to be delivered to the Brazilian Navy in 2018, after the end of military certification trials. It is part of a global order for 50 H225Ms for the Brazilian armed forces, 26 of which have already been delivered to the Brazilian Air Force, Navy and Army.

Helibras is in charge of the complete assembly of H225Ms in Itajubá, including integration of mission equipment, flight line activities and industrial acceptance. With a target to achieve 50 percent of national content by 2020, Helibras has developed a local supply chain which includes more than 37 Brazilian companies.

An Airbus Success Story: 10000 Aircraft and Continual Growth - AirlineGeeks.com,"Mon, 17 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZWdlZWtzLmNvbS8yMDE2LzEwLzE3L2FuLWFpcmJ1cy1zdWNjZXNzLXN0b3J5LTEwMDAwLWFpcmNyYWZ0LW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"[ Exclusive ] By James Field

Airbus’ success story comes from a time of slow growth, patience, and a variety of aircraft that were capable of changing the way that we see the air travel industry. The company emerged as an aircraft manufacturer where they started off competing in the dynamic twin-engine market.

Where It All Began

It all kick-started in 1969 when Airbus announced the Airbus A300B, their first aircraft. This aircraft was to directly compete with the Boeing 727, McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and the Tri-Star. This aircraft was significant in this market as it was only a twin-engined aircraft competing in a tri-engine market. The selling point to the Airbus A300B was an extra inch in terms of seat width. The conventional seats onboard commercial aircraft at the time were 17 inches. The first flight was on October 28th, 1972 which later converted into the first delivery for Air France. From 1969, the famous convoy that is now used to transport Airbus A380 parts was born. Ironically, at the beginning of production, Airbus used a converted Boeing Stratocruiser. By 1977, the Airbus A300B was given an ICAO ETOPS rating of 90 minutes. By 1982, the Airbus A300B4-200FF (Forward-Facing Crew Cockpit) was built, which removed the third crew member from the cockpit. This made the A300B the world’s first two-crew widebody aircraft in the world.

During the same year that the FF variant of the A300B was built, the Airbus A310 became the first step in building a family of aircraft. Today, these aircraft are still used but as freighter variants. The Airbus A310 pioneered new technology with a glass cockpit, a primarily composite-based structure, electrically signalled slats and flaps, followed by auto wind-shear protection, which was a first for aircraft technology in the 80s. The A310 also featured the first wing-tip device on a commercial aircraft. Additionally, the A310 integrated the same technology as the A300 so that pilots with an A300 type rating could also fly the A310.

The Emergence of Single-Aisle Aircraft

Two years later, the Airbus A320 was the first transition for Airbus from widebody to single-aisle aircraft. It was launched in 1984 with deliveries beginning in 1988. The A320 also advertised the 18″ wide seats that was on the A300 and A310 as well as containerized cargo and baggage, meaning more secured baggage being underneath the aircraft with minimal movement. The A320 was also the first aircraft to use the side-stick controls and fly-by-wire systems, which ensured extra safety when flying. The fly-by-wire systems enabled Airbus to create Flight Domain Protection, which allows more adaptation to flight with the use of computer systems as well as being able to set stall and speed limits, structural protection, G-load protection, and improved safety in extreme situations. Furthermore, the A320 also was the first airliner to use significant amounts of composites in its primary structure, much more than the A300 and the A310. In 1987, during production and testing, the very first carbon brakes were added to the A320 which meant fewer components were needed with there being longer durability on the landing gear. During the past two to three decades, demand for the A320 has been so popular that on average an A320 lands or departs every two seconds.

The Long-Haul Program

In 1987, Airbus went further than ever before. The Airbus A330 and A340 program was jointly launched to compete alongside with various competitors. The Airbus A330 was aimed at competing with the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and the L-1011 Tristar whereas the A340 was used to compete with the 747 and the MD-11. Both programs were the world’s first combined program and featured the same basic fuselage, wing and tail sections. To accommodate for such big aircraft parts, the Airbus Beluga family was then introduced in 1994 to replace the Super Guppy fleet. In terms of commonality, as the A330 and A340 had the same features, it ended up creating the same situation as in the A300 and A310 commonality program. The commonality within the dual aircraft program featured the flight deck, fuselage, wing, landing gear, systems, and empennage. The first non-stop flight of the Airbus A340-300 was on April 25th, 1996 from Toulouse to Singapore on a delivery flight to Singapore Airlines. The commonality between the A320, A330, and A340 offered CCQ (Cross-Crew Qualifications) and MFF (Mixed Fleet Flying). CCQ enabled airlines to save money on hiring pilots for specific aircraft when they could just train existing pilots which then lowered recruitment costs. MFF also linked up with CCQ as pilots could be rostered on different aircraft within a single week. The Airbus A340-500 was launched in 1995 and between 2004 and 2013, operated the longest flight in the world which was between Singapore and New York.

June 1994 came about and Airbus announced the A3XX which later became the Airbus A380. The Airbus A380 became the world’s first twin-aisle, twin-deck aircraft and also the biggest passenger aircraft in the world in terms of passenger capacity and size. The aircraft offered innovative flight control, featuring the first widespread civil use of 5,000 psi hydraulics as well as using three electrical circuits rather than two, using the third circuit as a backup in case of failure. Singapore Airlines became the launch customer for the A380 and received the first one on October 15, 2007. Later, Singapore Airlines offered the world’s first individual first class suites. The A380 became very popular for frequent travellers to long-haul destinations, Airbus set up the website iflya380.com which enabled customers to choose flights based on where the A380 was operating. Emirates is the biggest customer for the A380 as they are due to receive 140 of the wide-body type.

In 2004, the Airbus A350XWB was officially conceived as an aircraft that would be built and delivered in the 2010 decade. The first flight took place on June 14th, 2013 and went into commercial service with Qatar Airways in January 2015. 53% of the Airbus A350XWB is made from composite and 14% of titanium. In the past decade, the use of composites from Airbus has shot up by 40%. The A350 program also offered customers 25% less fuel burn compared to previous generations. The 18″ seats offered since the 1980s followed suit in this program, offering wider panoramic windows, larger efficiency levels, a unique flat level floor, and full LED mood-lighting to reduce the effects of jetlag. The advanced aerodynamics on the A350 offered weight savings thanks to the load control and drag reduction from the wing shape. Compared to the 90 minute ETOPS rating on the A300B four decades ago, the A350 now brags a 370 minute ETOPS rating and generates optimized flight routings.

Furthermore, noise reductions are also offered within the A350 program as they have managed to excel the 21dB requirement on the Chapter 4 QC 0.5 of the ICAO guidelines with a record of -19dB.

Airbus is also going to be releasing the A350-900ULR (Ultra Long Range) version which will enable even longer distanced flights. Singapore Airlines, who received the 10,000th Airbus aircraft, is due to receive seven of the ULR types and will be restarting their famous Singapore to New York service in 2018.

For the future of the A350XWB, they are aiming to provide a 280 ton version which would extend range by 500 nautical miles and give off a 2% fuel burn average as well as focusing on the regional and ULR models.

The New Engine Option

Recently announced over the past few years was the expansion of success on the original Airbus A320 program. This time, Airbus is progressing the program with the NEO (New Engine Option) edition of the A320 and A321 aircraft. The NEO family offers 95% airframe which spares commonality against the previous generations of Airbus A320 aircraft as well as lower operating costs with potential for revenue expansions in result of cost reductions. The neo also offers slim-lined seats, Space-Flex (a new rear galley configuration), Smart-Lav (new lavatory system), and a new door rating which increases the exit limit. This is also present in the A321neo with the new Airbus Cabin-Flex system for a new door configuration. The A321LR (Long Range) which will compete with the Boeing 757 and much of the long-haul market will be able to travel up to 4,000nm at a time without having to refuel, thus potentially growing the low cost transatlantic market. It would even be able to connect much of Southern Europe with South America, which would be beneficial to carriers such as TAP Portugal and LAN Airlines. In terms of strategy for the A320, they want to “make the best better” with non-stop innovation built on proven values that focus on an airline’s profitability levels.

It doesn’t stop there for Airbus. They also want to expand on the long success of the A330 program.

The company will develop the Airbus A330-900neo which will offer 14% lower fuel burn per seat. It will also follow the same cabin as the A350XWB with the Airspace cabin design.

Airbus also released the Airbus A330R (regional) model which has become a hit with carriers such as Saudi Arabian Airlines as well as releasing the 242 ton version to airlines such as Delta. To accommodate these needs, the current Airbus Belugas will be accommodated with the new Beluga XL from 2019 onwards to deliver bigger parts for the A350 and other current programs on the production line.

The Meaning of Commonality

Over the decades, Airbus’ commonality has now come to a specific stage where the common type ratings are more efficient compared to other manufacturers. For example, thanks to all systems developed over the past four decades, a transition in training from the Airbus A320 to the A380 takes 15 days whereas A320 to A330 conversion takes 7 days. It shows that training costs for airlines with different Airbus aircraft will be reduced and will also maximize productivity.

The Future for Airbus

In terms of the future for Airbus, they have significant steps that the company wishes to achieve over the next few decades. Airbus’ current focus is on Laminar Flow which is an adaptation of the A350XWB wingtip. They believe that the Laminar Flow will be able to provide 5% in fuel burn savings. This will be achieved through BLADE (Breakthrough Laminar Aircraft Demonstrator in Europe) and will aim to continue on Airbus’ need for efficiency and cost saving for all customers. Furthermore, they want to put more aircraft in the sky by adding double digit efficiency, allowing trailing planes to “surf” on wing vortice energy from aircraft as close as one mile apart. In turn, this would eventually create a formation-like style of flying.

The main objective that Airbus want to achieve by 2050 is the e-Thrust concept. If successful, this would be the first passenger jet in the world to be able to thrust aircraft on electric power only rather than on the conventional engines that manufacturers use today. It would consist of an Advanced Gas Power Unit to provide electrical power to six fans. It is a program that is a concept in development with engine suppliers to determine its feasibility.

Finally, Airbus’ innovations for future factories consist of direct printing technology which would meet the vision of a digital paint shop using ink-jet digital painting and printing without the need for masking liveries.

An Overall Success

Overall, Airbus has an overall success after the hard work of nearly five decades paying off. The airline now advertise a $952bn order book with yearly revenues of over $45 billion but still has work to do in order to create the visions that they seek. The airline now has over 6,700 aircraft left in backlog and have made a good start on the A350-1000, with 195 orders from 11 customers. They have over 40 Airbus A350s in the skies and are looking to be delivering more to clear their backlog of 810. All in all, no matter the economic situation, Airbus seems to be progressing well to overall success in the next few decades. They have big plans to deliver another 10,000 aircraft by the end of the next decade.

However, the latest effort, known as Vahana, has a bit more credibility than most. That’s because it’s one of the projects of Silicon Valley-based A³ by Airbus Group. Yes, the same Airbus that, among other things, manufactures the world’s largest passenger jet, the A380.

In September, Vahana released concept drawings of the completed design for a single-seat fully autonomous aircraft about the size of a car. Vahana is aiming to have a full-size prototype ready by the end of 2017, and if all goes to plan it hopes to be able to demonstrate the successful operation of the prototype by 2020.

Parachute to deploy in emergency situation

Vahana says it has developed and procured many critical subsystems and is currently in talks with parties to help build the prototype. The design calls for electric propulsion, fully autonomous operation and the ability to vertically land and take off. Should one of the motors fail, the aircraft is designed to maintain safe operation. And in the unlikely event of a severe malfunction, the aircraft will deploy a parachute that’s said to work even at low altitudes.

Vahana says some key recent trends make it possible for such an aircraft to be brought to market, at a relatively affordable price. These include advances in battery technology, automated composite manufacturing and obstacle detection and avoidance technology.

Not surprisingly, there are others competing in this space. One is Chinese drone manufacturer Ehang. Another is fellow Silicon Valley effort Zee.Aero, which is backed by Google co-founder Larry Page. Zee.Aero is developing a flying car and recently one of its prototypes was spotted at an airport near Hollister, California. Onlookers claimed the prototype, which also features electric propulsion, was hovering above the runway and taking off and landing vertically. The photo below, from The Mercury News, was taken by Steve Eggleston, who works at DK Turbines located next to the airport.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9990426898002625}",neutral,0.9990426898002625,0

The aircraft is the 15th A321 assembled by the Airbus plant in Mobile since it opened in September 2015.

Twelve of the American-produced aircraft have already been delivered to JetBlue, American Airlines and Sprint, according to Airways Magazine.

With final production lines in Germany, France, China and Alabama, Airbus expects to be able to produce 52 aircraft per month by 2018 and 60 aircraft per month by 2020. The Alabama plant will only produce Airbus’s narrowbody planes for customers in North America.

Delta received its first A321 in March of this year. The previous models had been produced in Airbus’s plant in Hamburg, Germany. The A321 has a capacity of 192 passengers and a range of 2,565 miles. The new planes are meant to replace Delta’s aging MD-88 fleet.

Delta placed an order for 45 A321 aircraft in 2013 and then expanded the order to 82 in April of this year, after delivery of its first. So far the airline has received 11 A321 planes.

The remaining aircraft will be delivered through 2019.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999551773071289}",neutral,0.9999551773071289,0

By pooling naval and aerospace skills and expertise, the teaming of DCNS and Airbus Helicopters will be equipped to address all technical challenges arising from the naval integration of the drones through the creation of a robust system architecture that can evolve and adapt to meet every need.For DCNS, drones are the roving eyes of the battle system; their missions are overseen by each ship’s combat management system, ensuring increased effectiveness in real time in support of naval operations. Offering a genuine tactical advantage, the VTOL (Vertical Take Off and Landing) drone is an organic component of warships and augments the operational potential of naval forces.DCNS CEO Hervé Guillou said: “We will continue to innovate in these areas and give drones the capability to perform increasingly complex missions over greater distances and timeframes in an interoperable environment with increased digitalisation of resources. Such digitalisation hinges on the roll-out of cybersecurity solutions that offer better protection of data and communications between drones and ships.”DCNS’s role in the partnership will be to design and supply the entire warship-integrated VTOL drone system. DCNS will design and develop the solutions for the ship-based operation and integration of the drone, including the specification and validation of the payloads and mission data links. DCNS will also produce the drone’s mission system, which will enable real-time management of its operations and allow its payloads to be controlled through the combat management system.Over the last ten years, DCNS has successfully overseen the French armaments procurement agency (DGA) and French Navy’s main aerial drone study and trial programs, operating both on its own and in partnership. In the process, the Group has acquired know-how that is unique in Europe and possesses solutions for integrating aerial drone systems in warships or enabling them to operate on ships. These solutions have been tested at sea.A versatile and affordable platform, the VSR700 has been developed by Airbus Helicopters with a view to providing military customers with a solution that leverages a tried and tested civil aircraft and strikes the best possible balance between performance, operational flexibility, reliability and operating costs. Harnessing autonomous flight technologies that have been tested by Airbus Helicopters through a range of demonstration programs, the VSR700 is derived from a light civil helicopter, the Cabri G2 (developed by the company Hélicoptères Guimbal), which has proven its reliability and low operating costs in service.Under the terms of the partnership, Airbus Helicopters will be responsible for designing and developing the VSR700 drone as well as the various technologies needed for drones to perform aerial missions, such as data liaison, payload and a “see and avoid” capability enabling the drone’s integration into airspace.“Rotary-wing drones will play a crucial role in tomorrow’s air/sea theatres of operation, performing the role of a roving eye and extending the coverage of surface vessels over the horizon,” said Airbus Helicopters CEO Guillaume Faury. “This partnership will see Airbus Helicopters pool its expertise in vertical flight and autonomous flight technologies with the skills DCNS possesses in naval combat systems, allowing us to respond to the emerging needs of our customers.”Thanks to the VSR700’s specifications, the system boasts superior endurance and payload performance to any comparable system used to date. The device offers big capability with a small size and logistics footprint, resulting in less maintenance and straight forward integration to a broad range of surface vessels.Airbus Helicopters, a division of Airbus Group, provides the most efficient civil and military helicopter solutions worldwide. Its in-service fleet includes nearly 12,000 helicopters operated by more than 3,000 customers in 154 countries. Airbus Helicopters employs more than 22,000 people worldwide and in 2015 generated revenues of 6.8 billion euros.DCNS is the European leader in naval defence and a major player in marine renewable energies. As an international high-tech company, DCNS uses its extraordinary know-how, unique industrial resources and its capacity to arrange innovative strategic partnerships to meet its clients’ requirements. The Group designs, produces and supports submarines and surface ships. The Group also provides services for naval shipyards and bases.

Hawaiian Airlines to offer iPad Pros for IFE on Airbus A330s - Future Travel Experience,"Thu, 20 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ1dHVyZXRyYXZlbGV4cGVyaWVuY2UuY29tLzIwMTYvMTAvaGF3YWlpYW4tYWlybGluZXMtdG8tb2ZmZXItaXBhZC1wcm9zLW9uLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzMwcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Share on LinkedIn LinkedIn Share on Twitter Twitter Share on Facebook Facebook Share on Reddit Reddit Share on Flipboard Flipboard Share on Tumblr Tumblr Share via Email Gmail Share on WhatsApp WhatsApp

Hawaiian Airlines will be offering 12.9-inch iPad Pros for in-flight entertainment (IFE) in the Premium Cabin on its Airbus A330s later this year.

The airline recently started sales for the new Premium Cabin on the A330s and has designed the seats to support the IFE solution, which is being delivered in partnership with Bluebox Avionics. It will be available starting 5 December between Honolulu and Narita, Brisbane and Auckland. It will also be available between Honolulu and Sydney from December 13. The rest of the A330 fleet will be retrofitted with the Premium Cabins and iPad Pro-based IFE through 2017.

This latest development comes after Hawaiian Airlines became the first US airline to offer iPad Minis on all of its wide-body Boeing 767-300 aircraft in 2013.

Avi Mannis, Senior Vice President of Marketing at Hawaiian Airlines, said: “When designing our Premium Cabin for the A330 aircraft, we wanted to redefine the leisure travel experience to Hawaii. Having our seats custom-built meant we could also include a totally new IFE solution as part of that experience – one that delivered the highest quality visuals on a large-format screen. That’s why we turned to our partners at Bluebox for a solution.”

David Brown, Bluebox’s Joint Managing Director, said: “Bluebox’s system gives Hawaiian the ability to provide the latest high-quality technology in its cabins, tracking the rapid evolution of device technology and making Hawaiian Airlines a perfect example of a first mover – bypassing the status quo to deliver something unique to its passengers.

“Our IFE platform not only provides an excellent customised passenger experience but saves airlines money – a win-win for both passengers and airlines. Bluebox has the relationships secured to deliver early window content on our systems and a high-quality platform that is much easier to deploy and upgrade at a fraction of the cost of traditional systems.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9217107892036438}",neutral,0.9217107892036438,0
The Airbus A320neo Arrives at Spirit Airlines Incorporated - Fox Business,"Sun, 16 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL3RoZS1haXJidXMtYTMyMG5lby1hcnJpdmVzLWF0LXNwaXJpdC1haXJsaW5lcy1pbmNvcnBvcmF0ZWTSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy90aGUtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjBuZW8tYXJyaXZlcy1hdC1zcGlyaXQtYWlybGluZXMtaW5jb3Jwb3JhdGVkLmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Last week, Spirit Airlines (NASDAQ: SAVE) became the first airline in the U.S. to receive Airbus' (NASDAQOTH: EADSY) fast-selling A320neo jet.

The Airbus A320neo has finally made it to the U.S. Image source: Airbus.

Spirit's new A320neo features state-of-the-art Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engines, which enable a big reduction in fuel consumption. However, while Spirit will get a nice boost in fuel efficiency, its first-mover advantage in adding the A320neo to its fleet is unlikely to impact its bottom line in a meaningful way.

Airlines love the A320neo

Airbus touts the A320neo as offering a 15% fuel efficiency improvement from day one, relative to the previous-generation A320. Future improvements will increase the fuel efficiency gains to 20% by 2020.

As a result, Airbus' A320neo has been a huge success ever since it was unveiled in late 2010. Airlines have already ordered more than 4,800 airplanes from the A320neo family, including more than 3,000 of the base model A320neo. This has encouraged Airbus to steadily increase its narrow-body jet production rate.

Spirit Airlines is a particularly big fan of the A320neo. The company operates just 90 airplanes today, but it has already ordered 55 A320neos for delivery between 2016 and 2021. ""This state-of-the-art technology will burn less fuel and lower our operational costs,"" said Spirit Airlines CFO Ted Christie.

These A320neos won't provide much cost savings

While the Airbus A320neo will undoubtedly help Spirit Airlines save on fuel costs, it will drive aircraft rent expense higher. The A320neo that Spirit received this past week was part of a lease that Spirit initially negotiated in late 2012, when jet fuel still cost more than $3 per gallon, roughly twice today's level.

Spirit probably agreed to pay a generous sum to get to the head of the A320neo delivery line, given that high fuel prices seemed to be the norm by late 2012. Indeed, fuel accounted for more than 40% of Spirit's operating costs in Q3 2012.

Fuel accounted for more than 40% of Spirit's operating costs in 2012. Image source: Spirit Airlines.

Fuel is still one of Spirit's largest expenses, but for the first half of 2016, it represented roughly 22% of its costs. Aircraft expense is not far behind. Together, aircraft rent and depreciation and amortization (which primarily represents costs related to aircraft that Spirit owns) accounted for nearly 17% of Spirit Airlines' costs in the first half of the year. By contrast, fuel costs were nearly three times higher than aircraft costs four years ago.

The terms of Spirit's aircraft leases are not public. However, it is likely that high lease rates for the A320neo that Spirit received last week -- and the other four leased A320neos that it will receive later this quarter -- will more or less offset the expected fuel savings.

Bigger benefits coming later

With 20/20 hindsight, getting to the front of the line in receiving the A320neo didn't work out for Spirit Airlines. However, jet fuel prices have started to rise recently, and this trend could continue in 2017 and beyond. If fuel prices trend higher, the A320neo's fuel efficiency will become more valuable for Spirit Airlines.

In this respect, Spirit is lucky that production delays at Airbus delayed its A320neo deliveries. Spirit was initially scheduled to get its first A320neo in late 2015 and receive all of its five leased A320neos by the end of last quarter. That would have been a waste, as fuel prices have been near multiyear lows for most of 2016.

The A320neo will begin to positively impact Spirit's profitability after 2018, when the carrier starts to take delivery of the 50 A320neos it has ordered directly from Airbus. In the long run, it is much cheaper to buy aircraft than to lease them. As these owned A320neos enter Spirit's fleet between 2018 and 2021, the company should benefit from a nice uptick in fuel efficiency without giving away all of its savings in the form of higher aircraft costs.

Nigeria and the C-295W: The Evolved C-295 as an Option for the Nigerian Air Force - Second Line of Defense - Second Line of Defense,"Fri, 28 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vc2xkaW5mby5jb20vMjAxNi8xMC9uaWdlcmlhLWFuZC10aGUtYy0yOTV3LXRoZS1ldm9sdmVkLWMtMjk1LWFzLWFuLW9wdGlvbi1mb3ItdGhlLW5pZ2VyaWFuLWFpci1mb3JjZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"2016-10-29 According to an article published recently by our partner defenceWeb, “The Nigerian Air Force is looking at procuring the C295W light transport aircraft from Airbus Defence and Space, with a delegation from Europe visiting Nigeria.

The delegation comprising two Airbus executives and the Spanish Ambassador to Nigeria, Alfonso Barnuevo Sebastian De Erice, visited the Nigerian Air Force’s Headquarters in Abuja on 25 October where it met Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar.

Nigerian media report that Airbus made a proposal on the sale of the aircraft to Nigeria in January this year, which indicated interest in the purchase. The Nigerian Air Force has made provision to fund the purchase in the 2017 budget proposal.

Abubakar this week asked Airbus Defence and Space to look at options to train Nigerian pilots and support personnel on the aircraft should the purchase be approved by the Federal Government.

The Nigerian Air Force said it is looking to acquire the C295W in a multi-role configuration, which would likely be for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and cargo missions.

It is not yet clear how many aircraft Nigeria is interested in purchasing.

Before the Airbus visit, on 20 October, French Ambassador to Nigeria, Denys Gauer, said the Airbus Group will open an operational office in Nigeria. This will mainly be focussed on commercial aviation.

Elsewhere on the continent, Mali is due to take delivery of a single C295W any day now, after ordering the aircraft in February this year.

The winglet-equipped C295W is now the standard production version. It was unveiled in 2013 with the aim of improving performance and fuel economy, especially in hot and high conditions.

The winglets improve cruise and fuel consumption through a reduction in drag and increase in lift – the C295W features a 200 mile range increase over the baseline model as a result of changes, or a 30-60 minute increase in endurance. Meanwhile, updated Pratt & Whitney PW127 engines add power in climb and cruise, improving all round performance.

Regarding Africa, at the moment Algeria has six C295s in service, Egypt has ordered 24 and Ghana has three.

Airbus sees Africa as a key market for the C295 and helped bring a Portuguese Air Force C295 to the Africa Aerospace and Defence exhibition outside Pretoria in September, in maritime surveillance/patrol configuration.”

"Big Qatar order for 787s, 777s sends a message to Airbus | HeraldNet.com - The Daily Herald","Fri, 07 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlcmFsZG5ldC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYXMtZXhwZWN0ZWQtcWF0YXItcGxhY2VzLWJpZy1vcmRlci1mb3ItYm9laW5nLTc4N3MtYW5kLTc3N3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Boeing Co. won a major order from Qatar Airways that buoys its 777 production rate in Everett. It also scored an important victory in its battle with the rival Airbus Group in the single-aisle market.

The Persian Gulf carrier ordered 30 787-9s and 10 777-300ERs, a deal worth $11.7 billion at list prices. Actual sales prices are typically negotiated down for significant discounts. It also said it plans to order 60 737 MAX 8s, a move prompted by its frustration with delivery delays on Airbus’ A320neo program.

The order, which was announced at a press conference Friday, is a boost for Boeing, which — along with Airbus — has seen orders slow this year in part due to economic uncertainty in Europe and Asia. Boeing and Airbus have huge order backlogs, meaning airlines likely will have to wait several years to take delivery of an airplane ordered today. Long wait times and low fuel prices now have led some airlines to hold off on placing new orders.

Boeing has only had 6 net orders for its 777 classic models this year. Company executives have said they plan to lower production from 8.3 airplanes a month to to 5.5 by 2018. And they have indicated production could slow even more, which could mean layoffs at Boeing’s Everett plant. The 777 is being phased out in favor of its successor, the 777X, which will be assembled in Everett.

Qatar’s order for 10 777s helps, but Boeing needs to sell more 777 classics to keep production up during the transition to the 777X. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said last month that the outcome of several 777 sales campaigns could determine whether the company cuts production.

Boeing also is considering whether to boost Dreamliner production from the 12 airplanes a month rate to 14 a month. Sales for the marquee carbon-fiber jet have slowed in recent years, even as production has sped up. Qatar’s 787 order is the biggest since Etihad Airways ordered 30 787-10s in November 2013.

Qatar’s letter of intent to order 737 MAXs underscores the company’s frustration with Airbus’ A320neo program. The airline ordered 50 of Airbus’ revamped single-aisle aircraft — 34 A320neos and 16 A321neos — in 2011. However, delays in the program prompted Qatar to cancel three A320neo orders in protest — one in June and two in August.

The delays stem from problems with the aircraft’s geared turbofan engine, which is supplied by United Technologies Corp.’s Pratt & Whitney unit. The holdups left the airline with “no alternative” but to order the “reliable” Boeing narrow-body planes, said Akbar Al Baker, the Doha-based airline’s chief executive.

However, Qatar still plans to take delivery of the A32oneos and A321neos it has on order, he said. “We never renege on contracts that we sign.”

A letter of intent is not a contract and typically does not require a down payment from an airline.

“It’s an announcement that an announcement is likely coming,” said George Hamlin, an industry analyst and publisher of Airline Monitor.

A customer can back out of a letter of intent, but it would make doing business with Boeing awkward, he said. “There would be some embarrassment from cancelling it.”

Regardless, Al Baker is “sending a message to Airbus — big time,” Hamlin said.

If Qatar did switch its single-aisle order from the A320neo family to the 737 MAX, it would not be the first time that delays on an airplane program allowed a competitor to grab market share. Airbus’ A330 received renewed interest from airlines when Boeing’s 787 program became mired in development delays.

Airbus is also behind on delivering its A350, which competes with Boeing’s 777 and 787, to Qatar and other customers.

Boeing’s deal with Qatar Airways was forged after the U.S. approved sales by Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp. to Persian Gulf allies, including as many as 72 Boeing F-15 jets to Qatar. The fighter-jet sale is subject to approval by the U.S. Congress.

A long and spectacular journey beginning with the Airbus 300B — the world’s first twin-aisle, twin engine aircraft – hit a major milestone on Friday with the delivery of a fuel-efficient A350-900 to Singapore Airlines.

The world needs more A380s.

The European manufacturer’s 10,000th delivery came as production at Airbus is at record levels and its ubiquitous single-aisle A320 is taking off around the world every two seconds.

The delivery milestone was celebrated today at a special ceremony in Toulouse attended by Singapore Airlines chief executive Goh Choon Phong and Airbus Group boss Tom Enders.

Enders said Airbus’s founders five decades ago could not have foreseen that the company would be delivering its 10,000th aircraft as early as 2016.

He said the company was producing at rate of just over half an aircraft a month in the 1970s.

Almost 8000 of the 10,000 aircraft delivered had been delivered in the past 15 years and it was less than nine years ago that Airbus had delivered its 5000th aircraft. It took Airbus 19 years to deliver its first thousand aircraft and just 19 months for the last 1000.

“There were years, I’m told, where we had more cancellations than new orders,’’ he said. “Today we deliver more than 600 aircraft a year and the ramp-up is continuing.’’

Enders said the company now had the widest product line in the industry and its manufacturing footprint extended far beyond Europe to China and the US. “We’ve gone from only 15 per cent market share as recently as 1995 to standard market share of around 50 per cent over the last 10 years or so and there’s not that much more you can wish for in a duopoly.’’

The Airbus boss said the manufacturer became faster and more efficient every year and the A350 gave a strong indication of what the next 10,000 aircraft would be.

He predicted accelerating technology such as digitalisation would see the next 10,000 aircraft come in many more versions and variations.

“I think we’ll continue to be smarter, we will definitely be more productive, we will be safer,’’ he said “The overall ingenuity our people and our many partners from all over the world can dream up will make them more fuel efficient, cleaner, easier to maintain, easier to operate… and able to carry more passengers hopefully in ever more comfort.

“And when we develop new aircraft, I’m confident we will be able to design and develop them much faster and with much less cost than is still the case today.’’

Goh was picking up the airline’s sixth A350-900 as part of an order that will see it take 67 of the fuel- efficient aircraft, including seven ultra long range planes that will be used on services from Singapore to Los Angeles, New York and an undisclosed third destination. It will be the launch customer for the A350-900ULR when deliveries begin in 2018.

The A350 delivered Friday will be used to re-establish long-haul services between Singapore and San Francisco and Goh said it showed how far Airbus had come.

“The A350s allow us to have more long haul destinations on a non-stop basis which helps to boost our network competitiveness and our connectivity and helps us further develop our home base, the Singapore hub,’’ he said, noting that customer feedback about the plane so far had been positive.

Singapore Airlines (SIA) and Airbus have a long history and shared several milestones, including the first revenue flight of the double -decker A380 superjumbo in 2007.

SIA placed its first order with Airbus in 1979 when it opted for the A300B4 and the group has since operated aircraft from all of Airbus’ product lines – the A300, A310, A320, A330, A340, A350 and A380 families.

The latest plane is adorned with “10,000th Airbus Aircraft” decal and will be used to launch non-stop flights between Singapore and San Francisco later this month.

Singapore Airlines’ first A350-900 went into service in March and the aircraft type is now being used for Amsterdam, Dusseldorf and Johannesburg flights, with more destinations to be added as additional aircraft enter the fleet.

Airbus has 810 firm orders for the aircraft from 43 customers, with Singapore’s order the second biggest after Qatar Airways’ 80 planes. Airbus is making two versions of the plane: the A350-900, designed to carry 325 passengers in a three-class configuration, and the bigger 366- passenger A350-1000, due to have its first flight by the end of the year and enter service in the second half of next year. Both are powered by Rolls Royce Trent engines: the Trent XWB-84 EP on the -900 and the more powerful Trent XWB-97 on the 1000.

Seventy per cent of the A350 airframe is composite Airbus says the aircraft offers a 25 per cent increase in fuel efficiency as well as significant reductions in noise, with exterior noise levels 21 effective perceived noise decibels below International Civil Aviation Organisation current standards.

Airbus currently produces about seven A350s a month but plans to increase the rate to 10 a month in 2018.

Poland to invite tenders for helicopter deal to 'console' Airbus - RFI English,"Wed, 12 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJmaS5mci9lbi9lY29ub215LzIwMTYxMDEyLXBvbGFuZC1pbnZpdGUtdGVuZGVycy1oZWxpY29wdGVyLWRlYWwtY29uc29sZS1haXJidXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FRANCE - Poland

Poland is to launch a new invitation to tender for 50-70 military helicopters to ""console"" Airbus, a government spokesman announced on Wednesday. President François Hollande cancelled a visit to Warsaw planned for Thursday after the Polish government pulled out of negotiations with the French-based aircraft-builder.

""To console Airbus, I can just say that there will be a new invitation to tender and there will be the possibility to take part,"" spokesman Rafal Bochenek told Polish state radio.

Airbus bosses on Tuesday slammed Poland's Eurosceptic government for pulling out of negotiations, which were begun by the previous administration, and placing an order with rival Lockheed Martin, a move that prompted Hollande and Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian to scrap plans to visit Poland.

The US firm will deliver two Blackhawks this year and eight in 2017, according to Defence Minister Antoni Macierewicz, who said 50-70 helicopters would be needed eventually.

Bochenek repeated ministers' claims that the end of the negotiations was Airbus's responsibility and cast doubts on the company's claim that it had promised to create 6,000 jobs, some of them not relating to manufacturing the helicopters, in Poland.

""It's a shame that the letters with this sort of argument were written after the end of negotiations because this sort of information is not in any of the official documents presented by Airbus,"" he commented.

French Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault spoke by phone to his Polish counterpart, Witold Waszczykowski, on Tuesday night, the Polish ministry said without giving details of what was discussed.

Pontifications: Hawaiian Air ponders A380 - Leeham News and Analysis,"Mon, 31 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNi8xMC8zMS9wb250aWZpY2F0aW9ucy1oYXdhaWlhbi1haXItcG9uZGVycy1hMzgwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Oct. 31, 2016, © Leeham Co.: Hawaiian Airlines continues to ponder the possibility of acquiring one or two Airbus A380s, its CEO said on the third quarter earnings call—something that raises eyebrows and a lot of questions with industry officials.

Mark Dunkerley, responding to a question on the call, said there are two or three routes that could support the giant A380.

Demand vs Complexity

“We’ve got a small number of discrete markets that have enough demand where a large capacity vehicle would make some sense,” Dunkerley said, according to a

transcript on SeekingAlpha.com. “I think arguing against it is complexity the fact that a fleet size would necessarily be very small indeed to look after these markets.

“I think in general, we’re always interested in finding out more about what the manufacturers are producing in terms of aircraft, what their capabilities are because I think we learn a great deal that way. I think in that sense, we’re always interested in finding out more. But the A380 would be an extremely large airplane in our network and it would necessarily be limited to two, maybe three routes.”

Which routes?

Dunkerley did not identify the routes, but it’s assumed to be Japan. The Japan-Hawaii market is a big one and generally lucrative. Further, with plans by Japanese carrier ANA to acquire three A380s (ex-Skymark), the assumption is likewise ANA will put at least some of them on routes to Hawaii.

Airbus likes to say you can only compete with an A380 with another A380.

Hawaiian also has ambitions to fly to Europe. The A380 could theoretically be assigned to this service.

Fleet complexity

But Dunkerley’s reference to fleet complexity and a small number of A380s argue against acquiring the airplanes.

Indeed, Hawaiian has a fleet of just 52: three ATR turboprops, 23 Airbus A330-200s, 18 Boeing 717s and eight Boeing 767s. It has 16 Airbus A321neos and six A330-800s on order and it’s acquiring two more 717s. The 767s are on their way out.

Adding two or three A380s adds to complexity: scheduling, crewing, maintenance, gates, passenger bookings and more, including operations.

Operational challenges

Such a small fleet begs unique problems in the event of a flight cancellation or mechanical issue.

Hawaiian’s A330s are common worldwide. Cooperation with other airlines for parts and Airbus supply centers are readily accessible. It’s also easy, relatively speaking, for Hawaiian to substitute one A330 for another if the assigned airplane must be taken out of service for a mechanical issue.

With only two or three A380s, aircraft substitution becomes problematic.

Sourcing

Where would Hawaiian get the airplanes for such a grand experiment and what would it cost?

Acquiring new aircraft adds to the risk factor for an airline Hawaiian’s size. So does timing. Airbus might be able to accommodate on the latter, but the former could be an issue. Airbus could do a sweetheart lease arrangement to get another operator for the A380, and the first US-based airline. Thus, pricing might not be an insurmountable issue.

Leasing in a use A380 might make more sense. Singapore Airlines was the first operator and it’s already said it will return the first A380 (a 2007 model) to the lessor next year. There are four others come off lease is quick succession. HAL might take up the two or three from Singapore.

Cost

The appraisal firm Aviation Specialists, in its September Guide, pegs the current market value (CMV) of the A380 at $91.1m. This implies a lease rate of $728,800 to $910,000 per month under a balanced supply-and-demand situation.

But with demand for the A380 on the secondary market so far to be (1) unproved (there have been no previous transactions) and (2) at face value, dismal at best (Very Large Aircraft, be it the A380 or Boeing 747, or even the Boeing 777-300ER, are out of favor right now in a sluggish wide-body market), HAL might be in the position to get very, very favorable lease rates and terms.

One of its new A330-200s has a CMV of $90m, according to Aviation Specialists.

If HAL can fill the A380, which easily carries more than twice the passengers of the A330-200 (and it flies farther), it can be a profitable airplane for the same lease rate—or less.

"Airbus Celebrates 10,000th Aircraft Delivery | AirlineGeeks.com - AirlineGeeks.com","Sat, 15 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZWdlZWtzLmNvbS8yMDE2LzEwLzE1L2FpcmJ1cy1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLTEwMDAwdGgtYWlyY3JhZnQtZGVsaXZlcnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"[ Airlines ] By James Field

On Friday, Airbus delivered its 10,000 aircraft The airplane, 9V-SMF (MSN54), was an Airbus A350-941 with a special sticker to commemorate the occasion. The delivery also has significance in terms of the relationships that the two companies have with each other. Singapore Airlines has been receiving aircraft for 37 years ranging from the first Airbus A300B delivered to the airline in 1979, to the current day Airbus A380s and Airbus A350XWB aircraft being delivered today. This A350 will boast advanced aerodynamics as well as offering 25% less fuel burn than previous generation large twin aircraft.

9V-SMF will be used to operate Singapore’s new nonstop route between Singapore and San Francisco later this month, offering a direct service to the U.S. for passengers in business class. In 2018, the Singapore – New York route will be returning using the seven A350-900ULR (Ultra Long Range) aircraft in which Singapore is due to receive. The A350-900ULR offers extra range that can be used for long-haul flights varying between 16-18 hours. Singapore has said that the 7 they are due to receive will be used on the extra long-haul services as they aim to expand more into the U.S. on top of San Francisco and New York over the next few years.

Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders said, “[we are] proud to celebrate this milestone with Singapore Airlines – one of our longest standing customers and a true partner. Today, the SIA Group operates aircraft across from our complete product line and with the highest levels of technical excellence. There is no better endorsement for our products and we thank the entire SIA Group for its ongoing confidence, partnership and support”.

Enders also humoured at the event how Chief Executive Officer of Customers at Airbus, John Leahy has been at Airbus for a long time, adding that he was responsible for over 8,800 out of the 10,000 total deliveries made within the aircraft manufacturer. Another fact is that Bob Lange, Head of Market & Product Strategy at Airbus, who was also present at the event, was responsible for 9,630 out of the 10,000 aircraft delivered by Airbus.

Goh Choon Phong, Singapore Airlines CEO, added, “Singapore Airlines is honoured to be receiving the 10,000th aircraft that Airbus has delivered. Airbus aircraft have contributed greatly to Singapore Airlines’ successes over the decades, and we are proud to be sharing this important milestone with our longstanding and trusted partner. Today’s delivery shows how far Airbus has come over the decades. On behalf of the staff and management of Singapore Airlines, I would like to congratulate Airbus for reaching this incredible milestone. Our relationship with Airbus is built on trust and it has gone from strength to strength. In 2007 we took delivery of the world’s 1st A380 & we remain committed to the ultra-large aircraft type”.

After the aircraft was revealed to the press, we were given the opportunity to go onboard the aircraft and have a look at the class configurations and other modern aspects of the AS50XWB. There are three configurations onboard this aircraft; business class, which offers a 1-2-1 configuration at the front of the aircraft followed by premium economy which offered a 2-3-2 configuration which is then followed by economy in a 3-3-3 configuration.

Pictures of 9V-SMF – The 10,000th Airbus Aircraft

After we got to look around the aircraft, we were invited to a Q&A with Enders, Leahy, and Phong and they were asked questions about a wide variety of questions. They mentioned that in terms of growth for United Kingdom post-BREXIT, there will be no threat to development and growth and that they would not pull out of the UK if BREXIT was to happen. Phong was questioned about whether he was going to be renewing the lease on the first A380s to which he said that it will not happen and that they will be replaced with the 5 new Airbus A380 aircraft the airline is due to receive. The focus that Phong stressed was on the A350XWB family as they are due to be receiving more of those particular aircraft types than the A380.

This delivery for Singapore and Airbus symbolises the growth in the Asia market. Singapore Airlines are to receive another 61 A350XWBs as well as another five Airbus A380s over the next few years. Airbus predicts that over the next 20 years, there will be demand for 13,460 new aircraft that will account for 40% of the global demand for the aircraft manufacturer. It is predicted that by 2035, Asia-Pacific carriers will be leading the world traffic with 4.5% annual traffic growth over 20 years. Within Asia alone, 267 firm orders from 13 different airlines have been made, accounting for over a quarter of orders for the aircraft. Airbus has received 810 orders for the A350XWB family from 43 different customers and have delivered 42 of them. Airbus is confident that the high level of orders for the A350XWB is due to the aircraft being designed more for long-haul travel compared to their competitors. They also believe that they provide an efficient, sustainable, comfortable, and connected service with the A350XWB.

The aircraft manufacturer has ambitious plans to deliver another 10,000 aircraft within the next decade. They said that this target will be feasible through the ramped up production of the A350, A320, and A330 family whereas A380 production will be downscaled to half by 2018. This will enable Airbus to focus more on the majority of their €952bn order book and begin deliveries of the A321neo, A350-1000 aircraft as well as the current A350-900, A350-900ULR variants and their A320neos.

The plane was met on a taxi way by Sea-Tac Airport fire trucks, and light smoke could be seen coming from the landing gear area. The trucks hosed off the landing gear area multiple times because they were over-heated.

Thirty minutes after the plane landed, the jet remained on the runway surrounded by a few fire trucks with all passengers and flight crew still on board. A few minutes later, the plane was being towed back to a gate.



Officials said no one was injured on the plane.

Delta is now investigating what set off the indicator light.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9965135455131531}",neutral,0.9965135455131531,0

"Qatar Airways signs on for up to 100 Boeing jets, sending Airbus a message - GeekWire","Fri, 07 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlZWt3aXJlLmNvbS8yMDE2L3FhdGFyLWFpcndheXMtYm9laW5nLWpldHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qatar Airways today sent a strong message to the Boeing Co. – and to Airbus, its European rival – by putting in an order for 40 wide-body Boeing jets and leaving the door open for up to 60 more 737 MAX jets.

The orders for 30 of Boeing’s 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 of the 777-300ERs would be valued at $11.7 billion at list price, Boeing said. The 60 single-aisle 737 MAX jets, covered by a letter of intent, would go for $6.9 billion at list price.

That adds up to $18.6 billion retail, but The Seattle Times’ Dominic Gates cites an estimate from Avitas, an aircraft valuation firm, that sets the value at $8.8 billion after standard industry discounts.

The order provides a huge boost for Boeing’s 777 and 787 programs, and for the company’s operations in Everett, Wash., where the planes are assembled. Qatar Airways currently flies 54 of the 777s and 30 of the 787s, with six 777F freighters and 60 of the next-generation 777X passenger jets on order.

24/7 Wall St.’s Paul Ausick sees the prospect of 737 MAX sales as the more interesting bit of news. Qatar Airways doesn’t have any 737s in its current fleet – but it has previously put in orders for Airbus’ A320neo jets, which are seen as the 737 MAX’s rival.

Qatar Airways ended up canceling delivery of the first three A320neos due to performance problems with the jets’ Pratt & Whitney engines. The airline’s CEO, Akbar Al Baker, has voiced dissatisfaction with that twist as well as Airbus’ delayed deliveries of A350 jets.

“Our relationship is very strained,” Bloomberg News quoted Al Baker as saying in August. “What’s happening at Airbus with the deliveries is seriously affecting our growth.”

In contrast, Al Baker praised Boeing as “a valuable partner” in today’s announcement of the new orders, which he said were “a testament to our appreciation of the quality of their product and their dedication to providing world-class customer service.”

“That has got to be satisfying to Boeing officials,” Ausick said.

Today’s announcement came just days after the U.S. government informally signaled its approval for the multibillion-dollar sale of Boeing-made F-15E Strike Eagle fighter jets to the Persian Gulf nation, despite concerns voiced by Israel. Al Baker said there was no connection between the two deals, but it’d be hard to imagine Boeing’s commercial jet sales going through if the military sales fell through.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.992531955242157}",neutral,0.992531955242157,0

10000 up - Airbus delivers its 10000th aircraft - Economy Class & Beyond - Kevin Marshall,"Fri, 14 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vZWNvbm9teWNsYXNzYW5kYmV5b25kLmJvYXJkaW5nYXJlYS5jb20vMjAxNi8xMC8xNC8xMDAwMC1haXJidXMtZGVsaXZlcnMtMTAwMDB0aC1haXJjcmFmdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"We mesure a lot of our lives, our finances and even fleet sizes in numbers. Well today, Airbus passed one very big milestone with the delivery of its 10,000th aircraft.

The aircraft in question – is one of the latest from the Airbus range – a A350-900 for Singapore Airlines.

The aircraft as you can see how been adorned with a “10,000th Airbus” logo.

As for the aircraft? Singapore Airlines will be looking to use the A350-900 to launch its Singapore to San Francisco service, which is due to commence this month.

For Airbus, it’s a major milestone, that started with:

the A300 series aircraft (wide-body – out of production)

the A310 following (wide-body – out of production )

The successful A320/A320neo family (narrow-body)

The A330/A330neo family (wide-body)

The A340 family (sadly for some – out of production)

The newst member – the A350 family (wide-body)

And of course, the superjumbo that is the Airbus A380

Airbus is on track to the deliver another 650 aircraft a year from both its narrow body and wide bodied families.

For Singapore Airlines, they’ve taken nearly everything bar the A320s (which are currently operated by SilkAir and TigerAir).

For Airbus – like Boeing – the continued innovation will be its future to deliver aircraft that can go further, carry more passengers and cost less to operate. Whilst the Airbus/Boeing rivalry can be fierce – it has pushed forward aircraft design and – where aircraft can take us as passengers.

And ultimately, the airlines too will have to play their part for a superior passenger experience.

And that’s a good thing.

Pratt's jet-engine stumbles taking toll | Arkansas Democrat Gazette - Arkansas Online,"Tue, 11 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMTYvb2N0LzExL3ByYXR0LXMtamV0LWVuZ2luZS1zdHVtYmxlcy10YWtpbmctdG9sbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At a recent aerospace industry gathering, John Leahy, the chief salesman for Airbus Group SE, went on about a futuristic airplane with an engine that he said ""no doubt will be delivered late.""

While the audience was amused, Pratt & Whitney surely wasn't. It's spent $10 billion and decades developing a quieter, more-efficient and less-polluting jet engine. Executives see the product as critical to catching up to rival General Electric Co. in the market to power narrow-body or single-aisle planes, the dominant aircraft used by airlines around the world.

Instead, the engine's debut has been marred by production delays, technical issues and supply-chain foul-ups. Qatar Airways last week cited the problems while announcing plans to buy planes powered exclusively by GE turbines. Pratt & Whitney was forced to cut promised deliveries this year by 25 percent, frustrating some airlines and plane manufacturers counting on them. The troubles have dinged the stock of parent United Technologies Corp., as Pratt & Whitney's $14 billion in sales accounts for about one-quarter of United Technologies' revenue.

""This is their big play to get back on [single-aisle planes],"" said Cai Von Rumohr, an analyst at Cowen & Co. ""This is the one that's going to have to happen if they're going to be a player in large commercial engines.""

The company has characterized the production issues as ""teething"" problems typical to new technology. President Bob Leduc told Bloomberg in June that complaints were overblown, saying the engines in service have been reliable while meeting promises of 16 percent better fuel efficiency, 75 percent noise reduction and 50 percent fewer emissions.

""The engine is as we advertised, period,"" he said. Pratt & Whitney has about 8,200 orders for the product.

Founded in 1925, Pratt & Whitney supplied engines to early planes and later for fighters in World War II. In the 1970s Pratt & Whitney was the leader in selling engines for large passenger planes. But its position slipped behind GE in the 1980s.

By the end of that decade, Pratt & Whitney engineers began work on technology to slow the engine's fan speed, which cuts noise and can improve efficiency. This year, the new engine, known as a geared turbofan, debuted in commercial service on the 180-seat Airbus A320neo -- the ""neo"" standing for ""new engine option.""

But production issues led Pratt & Whitney to revise its delivery schedule. Last month it said it would deliver only 150 engines this year, to plane manufacturers such as Airbus and Bombardier Inc., down from the 200 it had earlier pledged.

One of the sharpest blows cameOn Oct. 7, Qatar Airways made good on a threat to buy competitors to the A320neo over concerns about the delays. Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker, a vocal critic of Pratt & Whitney's engine issues, said his carrier would order as many as 100 Boeing Co. 737 Max jets to ""mitigate our risk"" on the Airbus plane. He stressed the reliability of Boeing's jet, which use engines from CFM International, a joint venture of GE and France's Safran SA.

Pratt & Whitney's delays have forced Airbus to alter its delivery schedule, substituting 20 A320 jets with older engines in place of newer models, according to Douglas Harned, a Bernstein analyst. An Airbus representative said the company would hand over more older-version A320s this year ""to make up for any shortfall on A320neo deliveries"" but didn't specify the number of planes.

The engine problems ""appear significant with path to resolution currently unclear,"" Harned wrote in a note. Pratt & Whitney declined to discuss its plans to improve production processes.

Delays also forced Bombardier to halve projected 2016 deliveries of its marquee C Series jetliner. The company has a deal to use Pratt & Whitney engines exclusively on the plane.

""This is very disappointing,"" Alain Bellemare, Bombardier's CEO, said in a speech.

But even after the various issues, Bellemare couldn't muster bad words for the engine's core technology: ""I'm still very pleased that we made that choice. It's the best engine available out there today for commercial aircraft.""

The ceremony took place at the airframer’s headquarters in Toulouse on 14 October.

Singapore Airlines’ latest aircraft, MSN54, is one of 67 Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-powered A350s ordered by the carrier. It will take the airline’s fleet of the type to six.

SIA intends to conduct a ferry flight with the aircraft – which features a ’10,000th Airbus’ logo in gold on its aft fuselage – on 15 October, with a view to using the jet on its inaugural service to San Francisco on 23 October.

Speaking during the ceremony, Airbus Group chief Tom Enders said the company was “honoured and proud” to supply the landmark A350 to a “long-standing partner”.

He adds that there could be “no better endorsement” of its aircraft than SIA’s operation of a wide number of Airbus types over the years.

Singapore Airlines chief executive Goh Choon Phong says: “We’re very honoured to be receiving today this extra special 10,000th aircraft.

“It shows how far Airbus has come over the decades.”

Airbus notched up 10,000 deliveries 42 years after it began delivering its first aircraft, the A300, in 1974, a year in which the airframer handed over 20 of the type.

Enders referred to the early days of Airbus production, stating that, at times, the company was manufacturing “just over half an aircraft per month”.

He underlines the subsequent advances in such areas as safety, efficiency and connectivity, adding: “I think the A350 gives a strong indication of what our next 10,000 aircraft will be.”

The first Airbus delivered to SIA was an A300B4, MSN117, which was introduced to the carrier in January 1981.

Singapore Airlines is also a launch customer for the ultra long-range A350-900ULR, which will be put on the routes to New York and Los Angeles from 2018. The airline is taking seven of this variant.

Creating comfort for the long-haul - Aerospace Manufacturing,"Tue, 04 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm8tbWFnLmNvbS9jYXRoYXktcGFjaWZpYy1sb25nLWhhdWwtYWlyYnVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On the face of it, from the average traveller’s point of view, the difference between the exterior of one commercial aircraft compared to another is pretty minimal. This is not surprising given the influence of aerodynamics means that the most efficient flying shapes will always heavily impact an aircraft’s exterior design.

With this being the case the interior of aircraft from an airlines perspective becomes ever more important. Interiors help distinguish airlines from their rivals and create a comfortable environment that will ideally make customers come back again and again.

However, OEMs such as Airbus, still have a big influence on how an aircraft’s interior is shaped as manufacturing and in-service costs and performance for their customers are also an important factor. Additionally, industry certification standards relating to Fire, Smoke and Toxicity (FST) have a big impact on the sorts of materials that can be used.

Wider possibilities

When Airbus began designing the A350 XWB’s interior it took the opportunity to improve the passenger experience as much as possible. This is largely due to the fact that its wider fuselage meant there was more room.

The A350 interior has now evolved into what Airbus calls its ‘Airspace by Airbus’ interior brand launched at the Farnborough Airshow this year. This design concept will also feature in the A330neo aircraft when it comes into full scale production later this year.

Jochen Werner, Airbus chief designer for cabin and cargo comments: “The philosophy of our ‘Airspace by Airbus’ cabin is to be the backdrop for the airlines’ brands. An airline’s brand is of utmost importance as it helps drive consistency, differentiation from their competitors as well as loyalty from their customers. This can be achieved in a number of ways: through the use of dedicated trim and finish, seat covers, curtains, carpets etc. and most importantly with lighting. The A350 XWB has the most powerful mood lighting system in the sky. In addition to conveying the airline brand it can also be used to enhance mood and atmosphere – creating a great customer experience.”

Comfort and connectivity: Cathay Pacific's business class seat

One of Airbus’ first customers to order the A350 is the Hong Kong-based airline Cathay Pacific. Its first A350-900 was delivered to the airline at the end of May. Cathay Pacific has ordered 21, A350-900 variants which seat 280 passengers.

Cathay’s configuration features 38 business class seats, 28 premium economy seats and 214 seats in standard economy class.

Paul Cruttenden, ‎marketing and digital sales manager for Cathay Pacific, explains: “The quiet cabin, panoramic windows, LED mood lighting with 16 million possible colours and huge overhead lockers all contribute to a more comfortable and relaxing journey in all cabin classes.

“The design of many of the cabin features has been carefully considered to give passengers the best sleeping experience, the best entertainment, and to offer them greater control over how they want to use the space, whether for working or to relax.”

There are less obvious advances that improve passenger’s time on the aircraft, vital for an operator like Cathay which operates many longer-haul flights.

“One of the most significant changes is the lower cabin altitude,” Cruttenden continues. “Traditionally, aircraft cabins are pressurised to a cabin altitude of 8,000ft but in the A350, the cabin is pressurised to 6,000ft. This means there is more oxygen in the air, and that can make a big difference to reduce passenger fatigue.

“The aircraft also has larger windows and the lighting throughout the cabin changes colour according to the flight phase to help reduce jetlag. The draft-free air circulation system combined with the airframe, engine and cabin design results in a low ambient cabin noise level for a more peaceful journey.”

So what was Cathay’s design intention for its new A350s?

“It focuses around a fresh new cabin experience that begins the moment passengers step on board,” says Cruttenden. “Throughout the development process three rounds of passenger testing were organised. The cabin interior is designed to best manifest the Cathay brand ethos through the use of colours, selection of material, and choice of textures and finishes. The essence of the Cathay brand is embedded in the definition of every detail, from the seat dress covers, walls of the aircraft interior to the finishes and paints of the galley and lavatory interiors.

Cathay Pacific’s first A350 arrives at Hong Kong

“For the first time, a harmonious design was thoughtfully carried out through Business, Premium Economy, to Economy cabins to ensure a seamless visual experience from the front to the back of the aircraft interior, and from cabins to lounges. Also the new A350 inflight entertainment system is inspired by the airline’s latest design philosophy. The interactive user interface is contemporary and fresh looking.”

For Airbus, airline input into the design starts at a very early stage. Werner explains: “During the design of the aircraft a number of customers, including Cathay Pacific, worked with us throughout the development period, to ensure the basic aircraft meets their needs.

“The cabin customisation exercise is done during the cabin definition phase, and involves relevant suppliers and Airbus specialists in working groups with the relevant airline teams. This happens at the A350 XWB Customer Definition Centre in Hamburg, where airlines find a true one-stop shop for cabin definition.

“Here, our own Airbus Trim and Finish and Lighting teams worked closely with Cathay Pacific and their designers. This helped to translate their design vision into reality, by means of a very close dialogue and working with physical and virtual tools.

“Our teams are ideally positioned as we understand both the airline brand as well as the Airbus and supplier requirements. This helps to ensure that Cathay Pacific gets the fantastic interior they want in the most optimised definition lead time possible.

“Airbus is offering and developing the most optimised cabin platform on each aircraft family, allowing the airlines to get the most efficient aircraft according to their specific operations and needs. In discussions with the airlines, we guide them within the wide offer, taking advantage of our market understanding and cabin trends monitoring‎ as an extra asset to support their cabin product development.”

Adding comfort: Cathay Pacific’s economy seat six-way headrest

Selecting seating

On the top of a passenger’s list of pluses for any airline is the comfort of its seats. After all, on a non-stop, long-haul flight passengers can easily spend more than half a day in a sitting position. In premium classes they even offer the passenger the chance to lie down. Seats are also an area where airlines can really emphasise their brand.

“The first step on the journey to provide our passengers with comfort while on-board the A350 began with selecting the most appropriate seat concept,” Cruttenden says. “We worked on optimising the seat concept spatially, keeping in mind that every inch that is given back to the passenger makes a difference to their comfort.

“With the A350 we have introduced a series of thoughtful updates all designed to raise levels of comfort. For example, the new economy six-way headrest hugs the head to prevent sore necks and shoulders.

“The new Business Class and Premium Economy Class seats are designed by Studio F.A. Porsche renowned for its intrinsic sense of premium quality and expertise for seat ergonomics, functionality and comfort. Passengers’ feedback has been instrumental in shaping the final product design.”

Werner adds: “Seating is the number one concern of passengers, with Y (Economy) class passengers benefitting from 18-inch wide seats as a starting point – Airbus’ economy standard. Other aspects of the cabin environment play a crucial role for comfort, and if passengers don’t think about these parameters, that’s often a sign we’ve got it right. From an airline perspective the choice of seating is a result of many criteria, including weight, cost, comfort, or positioning possibilities.”

Accommodating personal tech: Dedicated tablet holders in economy

Getting connected

The most significant change in the passenger’s experience is the development of In-Flight Entertainment (IFE). Long gone are the days when passengers watched a single screen at the front of the cabin. On the A350 each passenger has far more access to individual entertainment and also interconnectivity to their own mobile devices and the outside world.

Cruttenden states: “Cathay Pacific was one of the first airlines to introduce personal TVs on every seat but passengers’ expectations have evolved. Now, people expect a greater variety and choice of films, and, most importantly, they want to stay connected while in the air. We took all these into consideration when we created an enhanced IFE experience. First of all, the A350 uses the state-of-the-art Panasonic eX3 platform with HD personal TVs in all classes. By leveraging higher capacity servers, the A350 has a larger library of movies and TV series. We have also introduced a new interactive 3D map, more games, and a wide collection of digital magazines.

“With the launch of the A350, Cathay Pacific is introducing the opportunity for passengers to stay connected in the air. Inflight connectivity is available in all cabin classes on all Cathay Pacific’s A350-900s. For a fee, passengers can also use their own devices to browse the internet, send and receive emails, and stay connected on social media.”

“The A350 XWB is a fully ‘digital native’ aircraft (i.e. has been offering broadband connectivity from the beginning),” Werner affirms. “This helps support both customer experience as well as helping airlines with new business models. The latest systems offered on A350 XWB provide higher performance, more interactivity and are better integrated into the aircraft. Moreover, feet are not blocked by electronic boxes underneath the seats anymore, so the floor is fully flat, adding to the comfort of passengers especially on the long-haul.”

So what future improvements can passengers expect from the OEMs and the airlines?

Werner concludes: “‘Airspace by Airbus’ cabins have unrivalled levels of comfort, ambience, service and design. Going forward it’s the application of these attributes on our other aircraft programmes that set the standard for passenger experience.

“The space in the aircraft will, also in the future, be defined by the needs of the airlines and their passengers. We are focusing on new technologies and differentiation possibilities that continuously further enhance passenger experience and airline performance of our cabins.”

Flying the H125 FastFin system: one pilot's experience - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 11 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2ZseWluZy1oMTI1LWZhc3RmaW4tc3lzdGVtLW9uZS1waWxvdHMtZXhwZXJpZW5jZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"One of the first pilots to fly a FastFin-equipped Airbus H125 helicopter says the improvements to handling and tail rotor margin are even more noticeable in the modified Airbus than with the system’s iconic predecessor.

Though they are based on the same aerodynamic principles, the H125 FastFin differs from BLR Aerospace’s flagship product for Bell mediums because it does not modify the vertical fin but is comprised of an Advanced Tailboom Aerodynamic Cowling (ATAC), a Tailboom Strake and Vortex Generators.

Thirty-year helicopter pilot Jon Bourke flew the soon-to-be-certified H125 performance enhancement system last month in Gunnison, Colorado (elevation 7,000 feet). Bourke is the chief pilot of Helicopter Express and routinely flies Airbus H125, Bell 205, Bell 407, and Bell 206B/L aircraft for Part 135 charter, firefighting, external load, search-and-rescue, and aerial filming work.

Bourke said pilots will immediately notice that the aircraft requires “a lot less footwork,” adding, “the difference was especially noticeable when transitioning to forward flight.” The system also makes the aircraft “a lot less nervous to hover, and easier to pick up and land smoothly.”

Bourke sees obvious benefit in the FastFin kit for H125 operators performing external load work.

“It gives you more control margin in high-altitude conditions and a better comfort margin for critical work.”

In addition to enhancing margin, Bourke said FastFin is a “production enhancer if you elect to take advantage of the additional weight you can carry.”

FastFin uses advanced airflow management to increase the effectiveness of the H125 anti-torque system and an extensive flight test program has demonstrated significant performance improvements. For example, with as much as a 10 percent increase in available right pedal, aircraft useful load may be increased up to 130 pounds in OGE hover for most temperature/altitude combinations.

In hot and high operations, FastFin has been shown to provide an increased IGE hover useful load of as much as 85 pounds. Additional benefits include a reduction in pilot workload, easier control in precision hover-hold operations and better management of the yaw axis when hovering in challenging crosswinds.

BLR expects Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification of the H125 FastFin System and its performance charts in November, according to company president Mike Carpenter. Approvals from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), Transport Canada and Agência Nacional de Aviação Civil (ANAC) are expected to follow.

Once certified, the system will be available to the aftermarket and as a factory-installed STC option on new Airbus H125 helicopters.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.999969482421875}",positive,0.999969482421875,1

Making the freedom of flight possible is one of Airbus’ core values – a main reason why the company is working with wheelchair users to find an innovative lavatory solution for those with limited mobility.Visiting the lavatory in-flight can be a complicated and unpleasant process for wheelchair users – often requiring assistance from travelling companions to get on the on-board wheelchair, as well as for transfer from the wheelchair into the lavatory.As a result, a team at Airbus in Hamburg, Germany is participating in a joint project focused on developing a new on-board wheelchair that will provide more independence for passengers with limited mobility. The cantilever-style chair on wheels has a specially shaped seat that makes it possible to roll the chair directly over the toilet so that the passenger does not need to transfer.The on-board wheelchair’s design is based on a concept from the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences (HAW). Airbus’ ProtoSpace operation – a facility that provides the environment, means and tools to develop disruptive concepts and accelerate innovation – has provided support for prototyping.This cabin mobility innovation results from a workshop hosted this summer that collected experiences, requirements and requests from wheelchair users at Elbe-Werkstätten, a Hamburg-area organisation specialized in creating employment opportunities for people with disabilities.Project members rapidly developed a working prototype of the chair – which requires no structural changes to the aircraft lavatory – in just three weeks. Airbus Cabin & Cargo Engineering department created the design, the ProtoSpace team supplied the technical prototyping knowledge and apprentices and trainers from Airbus produced the demonstrator.“In the development phase, we focused our attention on the user and were able to produce the demonstrator quickly by applying agile working methods,"" explained ProtoSpace project manager Bessem Ayari.Following its short development, the wheelchair was field-tested with the Airbus Rapid Architecture Lab’s lavatory mock-up by wheelchair users from Elbe-Werkstätten, who provided rave reviews: the design is easy to handle, stable and safe.The wheelchair also received positive feedback during its public debut this summer at a conference on new aircraft standards hosted by the U.S. Department of Transportation. ""Participants from the government, airlines, aircraft manufacturers and organisations representing people with disabilities were impressed at how quickly Airbus produced a prototype, and that wheelchair users contributed directly to the design,"" says Hans-Gerhard Giesa, Airbus’ Head of Human Factors & Operations.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9977128505706787}",neutral,0.9977128505706787,0
Airbus considers compacting A380 forward staircase | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWNvbnNpZGVycy1jb21wYWN0aW5nLWEzODAtZm9yd2FyZC1zdGFpcmNhc2UvMTIyMDI5LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is developing an alternative forward staircase design for the A380 as part of plans to offer greater seating capacity on the type.

The staircase would be a more compact installation, set side-on to the aisle, more in line with the spiral design of the early Boeing 747 than the sweeping flight at the main-deck passenger entry door.

Airbus says the redesigned staircase could allow for another 20 seats in the aircraft, although it currently remains a project development study.

Speaking during a briefing in Toulouse, senior vice-president and head of market and product strategy Bob Lange said the airframer was looking to provide another 25m² of floor space compared with current deliveries.

The forward staircase is part of a series of improvements which could enable operators to fit around 80 more seats in the type.

Airbus has previously revealed studies to redesign the aft staircase and remove the sidewall stowage on the upper deck, which together could allow room for 20 extra seats.

Fitting an 11-abreast economy and nine-abreast premium-economy configuration would allow another 34 seats while a combined crew rest – which has been selected by some customers – could permit another three.

Airbus A380 gets lifeline with plan for 700-seat Hajj carrier | Mint - Mint,"Thu, 20 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9Db21wYW5pZXMvYURteFlBRWZiTHFoYTZ6eWxkdm9pSS9BaXJidXMtQTM4MC1nZXRzLWxpZmVsaW5lLXdpdGgtcGxhbi1mb3ItNzAwc2VhdC1IYWpqLWNhcnJpZS5odG1s0gGEAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9Db21wYW5pZXMvYURteFlBRWZiTHFoYTZ6eWxkdm9pSS9BaXJidXMtQTM4MC1nZXRzLWxpZmVsaW5lLXdpdGgtcGxhbi1mb3ItNzAwc2VhdC1IYWpqLWNhcnJpZS5odG1sP2ZhY2V0PWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"London: Malaysia Airlines Bhd. said it will use six surplus Airbus Group SE A380 superjumbos to form the core of a fleet of 700-seat jets dedicated to transporting Muslim travellers on the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca.

Peter Bellew, the airline’s chief executive officer, met with Airbus’s senior management in Toulouse, France, on Wednesday to hammer out details of the plan, he said in an interview, adding that the meetings were “very positive.""

Establishing a religious-charter operation is attractive because it would offer guaranteed revenues and predictable fares, passenger numbers and plane requirements, according to the CEO, who also looked at selling the A380s to Chinese airlines. The week-long Hajj and year-round Umrah pilgrimage could employ 20 superjumbos within five years and Bellew said the business might also tap further aircraft coming off lease or unwanted by other airlines.

Airbus has been seeking to broaden the A380’s appeal as orders from new operators dry up, and is keen to establish the jet’s credentials as a mass-market workhorse rather than a just a fleet flagship. Bellew said the Hajj unit would be established as a standalone business potentially open to investment from manufacturers, while declining to say if Airbus planned to take a stake.

“This is a huge, huge global movement of people,"" Bellew said. “We’ve done a lot of homework and the figures are adding up."" The operation could be given a name and formally launched before the end of the year, he said.

A350 switch

While airlines including Saudi Arabian Airlines, which leases-in dozens of jets to cater to the 2 million people who journey to Islam’s holiest city during the Hajj each year, and PT Garuda Indonesia, the biggest airline in the world’s largest Muslim country, have said they could use the A380 for pilgrimage flights, their plans have yet to come to fruition.

Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consultancy firm Endau Analytics in Malaysia, said it may be that the companies decided the A380 wasn’t the right plane for the Hajj, adding that Bellew’s decision not to sell his six planes suggests there is “no secondary market.""

Malaysia Air, which has a full-flight simulator for the A380 and a hangar able to accommodate three of the planes at a time, no longer needs the double-decker as it switches to smaller Airbus A350 wide-bodies and focuses more on Asian markets.

Planes used for the Hajj would be modified from their current 494-seat layout with Malaysia Air to accommodate 700 people in a single class, giving them the densest configuration of any superjumbo. Indian Ocean airline Air Austral last year scrapped its order for two planes it had planned to fit with 840 seats apiece and most operators stick to about 500, though Dubai-based Emirates, the biggest customer, has begun flights with a 615-berth version.

At least some of the Malaysian planes would be equipped to allow conversion when required to a lower 604-seat setup featuring business berths and better suited to the Umrah, which is not compulsory for Muslims and generally a more relaxed trip for participants, Bellew said, adding that the switch between seating patterns would take no more than a week.

Wet-lease terms

The aircraft would operate for other airlines or national governments on a so-called wet-lease basis, with pilots, cabin crew and associated services provided, the executive said. Potential markets range from Malaysia itself, where 60% of the population is Muslim, through Indonesia, China, Bangladesh, India, Arab north Africa and even the UK, he said.

The deployment of newer models on pilgrimage flights is likely to become mandatory as Saudi Arabia moves toward banning aircraft that are more than 20 years old for both Hajj and Umrah services, the executive said. Malaysia Air recently carried out heavy maintenance checks on its four-year-old A380s and found them to be in near-perfect condition, Bellew said, speculating that the model could have a lifespan of 50 years, “like the Boeing 707.""

Outside of the religious-charter market, the A380s could substitute for other large wide-bodies, such as other superjumbos and Boeing Co. 777s and 747s, when they are undergoing maintenance checks that can take three or four months, he said.

The business would most likely be established as a separate entity under Malaysian ownership and with a local air operator’s certificate, the CEO said. Manufacturers have expressed an interest in participating in the new entity on an equity or risk-sharing basis, while other governments could even take an ownership, he said. Bloomberg
