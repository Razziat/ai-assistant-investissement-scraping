Airbus achieves in-flight autonomous guidance and control of a drone from a tanker aircraft - Airbus,"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0wMy1haXJidXMtYWNoaWV2ZXMtaW4tZmxpZ2h0LWF1dG9ub21vdXMtZ3VpZGFuY2UtYW5kLWNvbnRyb2wtb2YtYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"@AirbusDefence #SmartMRTT #A4R #AirbusUpNext #DefenceMatters

Huelva, 28 March 2023 – Airbus Defence and Space and the company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Airbus UpNext, have achieved in-flight autonomous guidance and control of a drone using an A310 MRTT.

In a first step towards Autonomous Formation Flight and Autonomous Air-to-Air refuelling (A4R), the technologies demonstrate a significant breakthrough for future aerial operations involving manned and unmanned assets.

These cutting-edge, ‘Made in Europe’ solutions could reduce crew fatigue and the potential for human error, as well as minimising crew-training costs and providing more effective operations.

“The success of this first flight-test campaign paves the way for developing autonomous and unmanned air-to-air refuelling technologies,” said Jean Brice Dumont, Head of Military Air Systems at Airbus Defence and Space. “Even though we are at an early stage, we have achieved this within just one year and are on the right track for manned-unmanned teaming and future air force operations where fighters and mission aircraft will fly jointly with drone swarms.”

Known as Auto’Mate, the technologies were integrated on an A310 MRTT flying testbed, which took off from Getafe, Spain, on 21 March, and on several DT-25 target drones, acting as receiver aircraft and flying from Arenosillo Test Centre (CEDEA) at Huelva, Spain.

Over the waters of the Gulf of Cadiz, the control of the drone transitioned from a ground station to the A310 MRTT, autonomously guiding the DT-25 to the in-flight refuelling position.

During almost six hours of flight test, the four successively launched receivers were sequentially controlled and commanded thanks to artificial intelligence and cooperative control algorithms, without human interaction. The different receivers were controlled and guided until a minimum distance of 150 feet (around 45 metres) from the A310 MRTT.

Auto’Mate Demonstrator technology focuses on three pillars:

Accurate Relative Navigation to precisely ascertain the relative position, speed and attitudes between the tanker and the receiver;

Intra-Flight Communication between platforms to allow information exchange among the different assets, increasing the autonomy of the system of systems;

Cooperative Control Algorithms to provide guidance, coordination, consensus and collision-avoidance functionalities to the tanker and the receiver/s.

These pioneering technologies, developed by a European team from Spain, Germany and France, will continue to increase the capability gap among competitors, as well as being re-used in key technological projects, such as the Future Combat Air System (FCAS).

A second campaign is expected towards the end of 2023, exploring the use of navigation sensors based on artificial intelligence and enhanced algorithms for autonomous formation flight. In addition, there will also be two simulated drones flying in the vicinity of the A310 MRTT to demonstrate multi-receiver autonomous operations and collision-avoidance algorithms.

Airbus' most popular aircraft takes to the skies with 100% sustainable aviation fuel - Airbus,"Thu, 09 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTAzLWFpcmJ1cy1tb3N0LXBvcHVsYXItYWlyY3JhZnQtdGFrZXMtdG8tdGhlLXNraWVzLXdpdGgtMTAwLXN1c3RhaW5hYmxl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a key element for the future reduction of air transportation’s carbon footprint, and Airbus is continuing its testing of this bio-jet fuel with a new VOLCAN flight test campaign using the best-selling A320 Family aircraft.

An A321neo took off today from Airbus’ headquarters in Toulouse, France with both of its engines powered by 100% unblended SAF. Since the end of February, the aircraft is being closely followed by a data-collecting aeroplane with the mission to gather information on the non-CO2 emissions and the creation of contrails.



The A321neo’s flights are the latest demonstration in the VOLCAN project, the acronym of VOL avec Carburants Alternatifs Nouveaux, French for “Flight with new alternative fuels”.

The A321neo conducts a 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) test flight campaign on both engines show more show less This latest A321neo test flight has mobilised DLR’s Falcon 20E to capture and analyse in-flight data to better understand the impact of SAF on emissions.

Close-formation flight with our partners

Airbus’ VOLCAN partners are the French aerospace companies Safran and Dassault Aviation, along with the ONERA aeronautics research laboratory and the French Ministry of Transport. The project is co-funded by CORAC, the French Council for Civil Aeronautical Research.

An A321neo version powered by LEAP-1A engines from CFM International is being used for the latest tests, and provides yet another opportunity to evaluate the potential benefits of unblended SAF versus conventional aviation fuel. This A321neo is the first Airbus single-aisle aircraft and the latest Airbus aircraft overall – following the A350 and A330MRTT – to test 100% sustainable aviation fuel on both engines.

To gather the important information from this flight, a ‘chase aircraft’, a highly modified Dassault jet from the German Aerospace Center, DLR is flown within 100 metres of the A321neo, using the testbed’s sensors to capture emissions data for detailed analysis.

Unblended SAF for the VOLCAN flights

The VOLCAN evaluations are focused on the emissions of unblended SAF, which – unlike SAF blends that are increasingly being used in aviation today – is not mixed with any fossil fuels.

Analysing the performance of unblended SAF and its promise in reducing emissions (CO2 and non-CO2) is an important step toward the decarbonisation of the aviation industry, and Airbus is once again taking a key role in such forward-looking research.

Currently, all Airbus commercial and military aircraft, as well as helicopters are capable of flying with an up to a 50% blend of SAF. The goal is to ensure 100% SAF capability by 2030 of these products. The potential to cut emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel highlights the immense possibilities for SAF usage in the aviation sector."

Airbus and Norwegian Air Ambulance Foundation to develop CityAirbus NextGen's future medical missions in Norway - Airbus,"Wed, 08 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0wMy1haXJidXMtYW5kLW5vcndlZ2lhbi1haXItYW1idWxhbmNlLWZvdW5kYXRpb24tdG8tZGV2ZWxvcC1jaXR5YWlyYnVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Atlanta, 8 March 2023 - Airbus Helicopters has partnered with the Norwegian Air Ambulance Foundation to develop CityAirbus NextGen’s future missions for medical services in Norway. To this end, the parties will jointly measure the added value of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for a selection of medical services use cases across the country to integrate the operational requirements right into the configuration of Airbus’ eVTOL.

Focusing on how eVTOL aircraft can be used for different types of air medical missions, Airbus Helicopters and the Norwegian Air Ambulance Foundation will elaborate a comprehensive roadmap toward reducing emergency response time through the researched scenarios in Norway. In order to improve patient outcome and the overall performance of the Norwegian Emergency Medical Services system, the signatories will follow a long-term strategic approach to research the complementarity of existing assets, such as conventional helicopters, and eVTOLs when the technology enters into service. This approach could be further expanded in the region through collaboration with other countries to optimise operations beyond the national healthcare system.

Prof. Hans-Morten Lossius, Secretary General of the Norwegian Air Ambulance Foundation, said: “Airbus’ aviation expertise across the board is a major asset to help us combine different aircraft for medical services. Complementarity is a key driver in this endeavour: helicopters remain essential to perform EMS missions, whilst eVTOLs can bring additional capabilities to support first responders, for instance by transporting medical specialists to accident scenes or organs from one medical site to another.”

Balkiz Sarihan, Head of Urban Air Mobility at Airbus, said: “The Norwegian Air Ambulance Foundation has always been at the forefront of medical innovation, most recently with dedicated research to integrate a CT scanner into a five-bladed H145 helicopter. We’re looking forward to working with the Norwegian Air Ambulance Foundation as a strategic partner to further develop the exact missions where our eVTOL’s capabilities would contribute to protecting citizens and making sure they can access effective healthcare in Norway.”

As a result, the first step toward the creation of a medical eVTOL ecosystem will be the evaluation of the efficiency of the current emergency medical system in Norway, to then simulate different air medical services scenarios, integrating advanced air mobility assets. To develop the right concepts of operations for these complementary air medical missions, Airbus Helicopters and the Norwegian Air Ambulance Foundation will drive the definition of the foundational elements of the eVTOL ecosystem in the country, including for infrastructure, traffic management and energy sourcing and distribution.

Operating a mixed fleet of H135 and H145, the Norwegian Air Ambulance is Norway’s national Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) operator. With more than 40 years of experience in emergency medical response, the Norwegian Air Ambulance supports pre-hospital care across the country by delivering air ambulance services to provide patients with advanced medical solutions through state-of-the-art aircraft configurations and equipment.

A321XLR programme completes second cold-weather testing campaign - Airbus,"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTAzLWEzMjF4bHItcHJvZ3JhbW1lLWNvbXBsZXRlcy1zZWNvbmQtY29sZC13ZWF0aGVyLXRlc3RpbmctY2FtcGFpZ27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This week the A321XLR development flight-test aircraft (“FT3”, MSN11080) dedicated to the cabin returned from its four-day cold-weather ground testing at Iqaluit in northern Canada.

A few weeks earlier, one of the other A321XLR test aircraft (“FT2”, MSN11058) made a similar visit to Iqaluit. On that initial occasion the mission was to test the operation of the hydraulics and other systems at extreme cold temperatures – after an overnight soak at minus 40 degrees Centigrade.

Ground testing the water and waste system

“The objective of this most recent cold-weather campaign was to validate the aircraft operation in cold weather for ground operations,” says Tuan Do, Lead Flight Test Engineer.

He notes: “This time around we tested the cabin water and waste system – which required the temperatures inside the unheated cabin to ‘soak’ at below -15 degrees Centigrade overnight. To this end, several cold soaks and subsequent ground service operations were conducted over successive days.""

In each case different heating and insulation configurations were applied for subsequent comparative analysis by the engineering department.”

As part of this, a new ‘cold weather option’ available for A321XLR operators, was tested in real conditions for the first time, which adds insulation and heaters. The tests also validated the ‘standard aircraft’ configuration – i.e. without the optional package activated.

Of course, every airliner cruises at high altitudes where the outside temperatures are much lower. However, inside the cabin the water and waste systems operate in above zero temperatures. This is why ground testing (in a completely powered-down state) is specifically called for – so that the ambient environment inside the cabin and below the passenger deck, where many systems are located, can cold-soak at sub-zero temperatures. Following this, in the morning the built-in defrosting/heating equipment was demonstrated, to allow ground servicing to proceed.

Hydraulics, oil and electrical system testing at -40 degrees Centigrade

“During our first five-day visit to Iqaluit a month ago, when we powered-up the aircraft in the morning, we would ‘wake-up’ the hydraulics, electrics, and other systems and see how long it took to operate the aircraft and get it ready for taxiing and takeoff.”

“There were also some flights to validate the landing gear operation in very cold temperatures. Notably, the A321XLR features an uprated landing gear – to support the higher maximum take-off weight of the aircraft (whose MTOW is 101 metric tonnes, vs 97 tonnes for the A321LR). Consequently, the shock-absorbers on this new variant are designed to handle higher loads compared with those on the other A320 Family members.



The test objective was to check the ‘weight-on-wheels’ signal, so the aircraft knows when the main landing gear shock absorbers are compressed or extended.

“There are many systems on the aircraft which depend on the weight on wheels signals to tell them whether the aircraft is in flight or on ground. So during our first visit to Iqaluit we verified how the weight-on-wheels function is affected by the physical changes in the main landing gear, and how shock absorber stiffness is affected by cold temperatures,” recalls Tuan.

Another design feature of the -XLR related to hydraulics which needed to be evaluated in the cold environment were new hydraulic lines which pass through Rear Centre Tank, located aft of the Landing Gear bay. “Our design office colleagues wanted us to check that the routing of the pipes did not significantly affect the hydraulic temperatures and operations after warm-up of the aircraft,” notes Tuan.

Other cold weather challenges, applicable for any aircraft, include ensuring that hatches don’t freeze shut, or that the systems in general don't freeze up – not only the water pipes, oil and hydraulics systems, but also the electrical system, especially batteries. “Batteries don’t hold as much charge or provide as much power output when they are at low temperatures. Meanwhile, oil and hydraulics become very viscous at very low temperatures which makes it hard to move flight control surfaces around and drive pumps etc. So you need to heat the aircraft up and its pipework to be able to operate the aircraft,” explains Tuan.

Human challenges

The challenges behind the cold weather campaign also include human ones,” he notes. “We have maintenance and ground support teams who need to prepare and configure the aircraft, and check everything outside. They need to have the right clothes and equipment compatible with operations outside. But even with those provisions, the wind-chill factor is so strong in Iqaluit that it's difficult. You can only work for a limited time outside, so we have shifts to ensure that nobody stays outside for too long.”

On-site Airbus for its part, had brought a team of more than 30 people. These included: six flight crew – pilots, flight test engineers, and a test-flight engineer; a cabin specialist engineer; a maintenance team – comprising mechanical specialists, electrical specialists, quality inspectors; instrumentation specialists; systems design specialists; technical photographers; as well as an operations colleague to oversee the logistics for the overall journey.

The human challenges are not simply on-site in Iqaluit, rather, they begin much earlier. The flight-test engineers will have agreed the test requirements with the design engineers’ office several months in advance, and from that will have prepared the campaign mission plan together with the mission flight-crew and ‘test-flight’ engineer colleagues. Together they determine how they need to configure the aircraft inside and out, when to start taxiing and then take-off, and what the ambient and systems temperature conditions should be etc. They will sequence all the testing and planning of the campaign, and of course, ensure that the whole mission is conducted safely."

Since the establishment of Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA) in March 1923, the Spanish industry has continually evolved, and today hosts production facilities for Airbus aircraft and helicopters, along with space and defence products. Research and development centres in Spain also are vital in keeping Airbus at the forefront of technology – preparing for the next 100 years.

Approximately 13,000 highly qualified Airbus employees work at eight sites across three of Spain’s main regions: Madrid, Castile-La Mancha and Andalusia. As a result, Airbus is at the heart of aerospace and defence in Spain, leading most of the country’s national and cooperative programmes in these sectors.

Defence: from airlifters to drones and mission systems

Defence activities represent a large share of Airbus’ business in Spain. This reflects the country’s traditional strengths that trace their roots to CASA’s heritage, including the twin-engine C-212 Aviocar STOL (short takeoff and landing) multi-role airlifter developed in the 1960s and built during a production run spanning 40 years. Today, the focus is on the development of aircraft for strategic and tactical transportation, as well as for special missions – along with an important role in the multi-national Eurofighter combat jet aircraft programme.

Among the most visible aspects of Spain’s defence activity are its assembly facilities for Airbus’ large four-engine A400M turboprop-powered airlifter and the twin-turboprop C295 tactical transport. They are joined by the conversion centre that transforms A330s from their passenger configuration into the A330 MRTT (Multi-role Tanker Transport). The International Training and Delivery Centres for Airbus Air Systems also are located in the country, along with the production of aircraft components in advanced aviation materials.

Airbus has evolved its capabilities in Spain for current- and future-generation drones and unmanned aerial vehicles; while world-leading experts in geo-information, mission systems, ground stations, intelligence, simulation and environmental management are employed by Airbus as well. The Andalusian plants of Tablada and Cádiz will participate in the industrialization and production of the Eurodrone.

For theFuture Combat Air System (FCAS) – which is Europe’s most important defence project for the coming decades – Spain will be at the centre of its development, focussing on Enhanced Low Observability (stealth) capabilities as well as the New Generation Fighter.

Spain’s involvement in Airbus commercial aircraft

Spanish locations are responsible for the design, engineering and manufacturing of components for nearly all Airbus widebody and single-aisle commercial aircraft, beginning in the 1970s with elements for the cornerstone A300 and A310. Current production ranges from empennages and aft fuselages to horizontal stabilisers and tail cones for A330, A350 and A320 Family aircraft. The A350 wing’s lower cover – the largest single carbon fibre component on this latest member of Airbus’ widebody product line – also is produced in Spain.

Aviation’s future will depend on its ability to decarbonise, with Spain playing a key role in Airbus’ research and development that support a more sustainable air transport industry. The country is home to one of the flagship locations for Airbus UpNext, which has the mission to rapidly develop and test future disruptive aerospace technologies in scaled applications.

Also in Spain is Airbus’ Zero Emission Development Centre (ZEDC) for hydrogen technologies, placing the focus on non-propulsive energy, systems for fuel cell cooling and fibre optics, as well as carbon fibre tanks for cryogenic liquid hydrogen storage.

Airbus’ leadership role in Spain for helicopters

Airbus leads the helicopter-sector business in Spain, supplying company-built rotorcraft to customers in the military, government, police and other sectors. The country has a long helicopter tradition, leading back to the 1920’s invention of the autogyro by Spanish engineer Juan de la Cierva.

Helicopter-related design, manufacturing, MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul), as well as sales, engineering, programme management, sales and support functions are handled by Airbus’ Spanish employees.

Spain also is a centre of excellence for rear fuselages incorporated in Airbus’ entire helicopter range – both civil and military – and is where production of the front and centre fuselages for all variants of theNH90 helicopter takes place.

Involvement in Spanish, European and U.S. space programmes

Since 1966, Airbus has been part of European and Spanish national space programmes, with involvement in satellites, launchers and in-orbit infrastructure. This includes Airbus’ prime contractor role for Spain’s PAZ observation and reconnaissance satellite launched in 2018, and the first European Space Agency (ESA) satellite built by a Spanish company: theCHEOPS (CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite) space telescope, lofted in 2019.

Spanish design and manufacturing also involve large carbon fibre structures for the Ariane 5, Ariane 6 and Vega commercial launchers. Expertise in the treatment of carbon fibre has given Spain the recognition as a Composite Centre of Excellence, and a new industrial site at Getafe will handle production that includes the layup, processing and painting of composite structures for the next-generation Ariane 6.

Airbus designs and produces state-of-the-art electronic products for space applications that range from satellites, deep space probes and orbital infrastructure to space transportation systems. Among the examples are onboard data processing and control systems that have been core capabilities at Airbus Crisa in Spain since the inception of this business more than 35 years ago.

Space exploration also plays a key role in Airbus’ Spanish-based activities, including the contribution of active antennas on the U.S.-developed NASA Curiosity and Perseverance Martian rovers – enabling communications with Earth from the Red Planet’s surface.

Airbus is building theLSTM satellite in Spain to monitor land surface temperatures as part of the European Union’s Copernicus programme. In the field of payloads and instruments, Airbus’ Spanish personnel are developing the European component of the European Space Agency’s SMILE satellite, which is designed to provide a better understanding of space weather; as well as the ICI (Ice Cloud Imager) and SCA wind scatterometer instruments for the MetOp-SG second-generation operational meteorological satellites. Additionally, Airbus’ Spanish operation is responsible for integrating the payload on SPAINSAT NG satellites to be orbited for the country’s government and military secure communications needs.

As Airbus celebrates 100 years of Spain’s industrial legacy, the company’s Spanish teams are committed to innovating and pioneering the next century of aviation, defence and space."
Proving the A321XLR's Airspace Cabin design – in flight - Airbus,"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTAzLXByb3ZpbmctdGhlLWEzMjF4bHJzLWFpcnNwYWNlLWNhYmluLWRlc2lnbi1pbi1mbGlnaHTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The third A321XLR flight test aircraft – MSN11080 – also known as “FT3”, which is dedicated to the in-flight validation of its cabin-related aspects, is currently in the midst of its busy flight test schedule, following its first flight on 20th October 2022.

This testing focuses on more than just the highly visible Airspace branding elements – such as new overhead stowage compartments (OHSC), ceiling panels etc. – but also the numerous ‘behind the scenes’ new system adaptations and features relating to thermal comfort, ventilation, water & waste, sound insulation, and so on. Together, all these aspects, among others, will contribute to achieving the best possible passenger and flight-crew experience, as well as airline and airport performance and flexibility – given the Xtra Long-Range routes on which this aircraft will routinely fly.

""While the first A321XLR aircraft – MSN11000 (FT1) – had earlier performed some basic functionality pre-testing of the waste water system as well as some acoustic tests, our focus is mainly on FT3, where the Airspace Standard Cabin comes in for the first time."" - Tuan Wei Chung, the Cabin & Cargo (C&C) Lead for the A321XLR’s ‘Cross Functions’

More than meets the eye

Inside this dedicated cabin flight test aircraft the teams will be able to test all sorts of things which passengers don’t actually see or hear but nevertheless do appreciate – such as water, waste and heating options available – notably including the optional 300 litre waste-water tank, the heated floor panels, the potable water storage and supply, and the associated freezing protection measures – which include ‘tape heaters’ for the water lines.

“With FT3 we also evaluate the more overt cabin comfort aspects, in particular the thermal (cabin temperature control – which was tested in November 2022 using passenger-heater-dummies) as well as the overall acoustic properties – ie the cabin quietness,” notes Tuan.

The results from this campaign were recently validated by the programme’s internal steering committee as meeting the design requirements. Subsequently, FT3 has been fitted with flight test instrumentation (FTI) installations for the cold temperature campaigns which are planned to take place in Iqaluit in northern Canada. The freezing protection and insulation of the water lines will be tested as well as the complete waste tank itself and lavatory areas – so this is a big campaign for the team

Later this year there will also be a flight test campaign more oriented to gauging passenger perceptions. “This will include a dedicated flight of up to seven hours with Airbus employees - acting as passengers - on board. Various comfort aspects will be asked, not only from the passengers, but also for the crew. We will conduct surveys, to assess the passenger comfort level on the aircraft during the long flights with regards to temperature and noise,” explains Tuan.

The team will take the opportunity to make some direct ‘spot’ measurements – acoustic as well as temperature – using a hand-held sensing device. Crew noise exposure will be recorded, especially around the main door entrance areas.



The new Airspace cabin elements will be tested as well. For example, the new parts will be checked for any vibration or resonance during the phases of flight. Ergonomic aspects will also be assessed, such as how easy or hard it is to load and unload the new overhead bins. Airbus will also receive feedback on the visual aspects of the cabin.

Other design changes now being fine-tuned for the best possible in-flight experience inside the A321XLR include items such as the extra fuel pumps for the new underfloor Rear-Centre-Tank (RCT). There are additional pumps to supply fuel from this tank, and any acoustic energy they emit is monitored closely.

Higher requirements for the A321XLR long range cabin

For the XLR’s long range missions there are now higher thermal and acoustic requirements for the cabin. “We have added insulation in the forward fuselage section and developed a new lining as standard within the door and door-surround structures, says Mehmet Altay, Cabin & Cargo Engineering Project Leader.“We have also developed an optional thermal/acoustic ‘Textile Door Cover’ for Doors-1 and Doors-4 which can be attached via magnets to each door by the crew during flight. “Additionally, in the Doors-1 and Doors-4 entrance areas we have new heated floor panels, as well as a quieter fresh air vent outlet.”

Comfortable 6,000ft cabin altitude during cruise

A notable passenger/crew wellbeing-related feature of the A321XLR during long cruise at high flight levels is the latest 'cabin pressure control' standard (introduced across all the A320 Family). The system actively schedules proportional cabin altitudes depending on the flight level. For the A321XLR this means that a cabin altitude of less than 6,000ft is achieved when the aircraft is cruising at 33,000ft. Low cabin altitudes create a more comfortable and less fatiguing in-flight environment for passengers and crew.

Improved sidewall and ceiling panels

The teams have also developed a new visually improved lightweight sidewall and ceiling panels for the A321XLR. Of course the panels themselves are already qualified and have passed all the tests, and now the teams are making sure everything will be really robust in flight, as close as can be to airline operations.

New Flexible zone in forward cabin

Another key feature concerns the forward passenger cabin. “The cabin layout itself is becoming more complex than we used to know in the single-aisle business,” observes Mehmet. “While the galleys and other monuments haven’t really changed, we have many more combinations of monuments in the forward cabin.”

In particular, the XLR benefits from the so-called ‘full-flex zone’ which was first introduced on the A321neo “ACF” standard (ACF = “Airbus Cabin Flex”). This is the zone in the forward half of the fuselage between Doors-1 and Doors-2 where airlines can place monuments – such as galleys and lavatories – which conveniently allows them to segment the cabin into different seating classes. The trend for the -XLR is moving towards more ‘enriched’ cabins with at least two-class layouts and going to three-class.

Customer at Heart

Overall, all the products developed and decisions made by the teams were customer-focused. “We involved our customers by inviting them to our ‘Customer Experience’ workshops in Hamburg,” says Tuan. “Having this interaction in the development phase was proven essential in getting useful feedback to improve our design.”

For example, based on the airlines’ valuable in-service feedback from their A321neos featuring the more recent ACF configuration, the C&C teams were able to define and implement further improvements proposed for the A321XLR, including the enhanced thermal and acoustic comfort at the forward and aft entrance areas (eg. adjacent to Doors-1 and Doors-4) by introducing insulation means, gap closures and optional textile door covers. This would bring benefits in particular for the cabin crews’ working environment, especially during long range flights.

Next step: MG13

“The next step is the Milestone MG13 'Maturity Gate'. That means everything that we have developed is now in the phase to obtain EASA Type Certification, and then to hand it over to the series production organisation for Entry Into Service,” says Mehmet. “This is the main milestone we're heading for now. Stay tuned.”"

Providing safe water and improved hygiene in underserved communities - Airbus,"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTAzLXByb3ZpZGluZy1zYWZlLXdhdGVyLWFuZC1pbXByb3ZlZC1oeWdpZW5lLWluLXVuZGVyc2VydmVkLWNvbW11bml0aWVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters and the Airbus Foundation partner with local organisations to increase access to clean water for thousands in the Philippines and Kenya.

Access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene is the most basic human need for health and well-being, and UN Sustainable Development Goal 6 seeks to drive awareness and progress on achieving clean water and sanitation for all. At Airbus, this means responsibly managing the water usage within our own sites and operations, as well as developing solutions and partnerships that seek to increase access to clean water in underserved communities through our global community impact programme.

Safe drinking water and improved hygiene have become a reality for two communities in the Philippines and Kenya through partnerships supported by Airbus Helicopters and the Airbus Foundation.

In the Philippines, Airbus Helicopters has partnered with the Manila Water Foundation to develop a WASH (water access, sanitation and hygiene) facilities project. Particularly relevant in a post-pandemic context, this project, created in 2022, promotes good health and wellbeing by ensuring access to clean water and raising awareness for hygiene practices, such as regular handwashing.

A first line of defence from Airbus Helicopters and the Manila Water Foundation

A total of five multi-faucet hygiene facilities were installed at public schools and health centres in Quezon province’s General Nakar municipality, and at the city of Calbayog in the Samar province between November 2022 and January 2023. The locations were selected together with the respective communities as the first line of defence against the spread of viruses and communicable diseases in these neighbourhoods.

More than 12,000 community members have benefitted and the partnership also includes inspection of the facilities to ensure proper functionality and maintenance, local training, as well as professional community health assessment to evaluate if the sanitation and the community’s handwashing habits have improved over time.

The Airbus partnership with the Manila Water Foundation received special recognition by the French Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Airbus Helicopters in the Philippines was awarded with Le Trophée Bleu: Sustainability Business Awards in the Partnership category. The award category recognises initiatives which embody the spirit of global solidarity while also acknowledging the need for collaboration in achieving sustainability goals

The Airbus Foundation’s water collaboration reaches 8,000-plus students in Kenya

Access to safe drinking water and proper sanitation is a basic right, yet many communities in Nairobi's informal settlements continue to face challenges in accessing clean water, leading to waterborne diseases and poor hygiene practices.

A multi-year Airbus Foundation partnership has marked significant milestones in the installation of innovative plasma water purification systems for vulnerable communities in Nairobi.

Kenyan Red Cross | Plasma Water sanitation system in Kenya

Since initiating this collaboration in 2019, the Foundation has worked with Plasma Waters in Chile and the Kenya Red Cross Society to bring the Plasma Water Sanitation Systems Project (PWSS) to seven schools in the Mukuru informal settlements of Nairobi, already reaching over 8,000 students.

The PWSS project has also provided critical hygiene education on a wider scale, with 30 Community Health Volunteers (CHVs) trained in hygiene education reaching out to over 1,400 households. Additionally, multiple awareness sessions were organised to educate the community on the importance of proper hygiene practices.

To ensure the continuation and positive impact of the project for the longer term, the Plasma Waters team developed a mobile application that enables remote monitoring of the plasma water purification systems, identifying faults or irregularities. The project also has trained and hired a local engineer to support the maintenance of the units, ensuring the systems continue to function effectively.

Recognition by the Kenya Ministry of Education and the Kenya Red Cross

Hezbon Nyagaka, the Nairobi County Education Officer, recognised the PWSS’ success, pledging the Kenya Ministry of Education’s support for future implementations; while Swabira Abdulrazak, the Kenya Red Cross’ Innovation Officer, highlighted the opportunity to scale up this project in other parts of the region – providing additional informal settlements with safe drinking water and promoting proper hygiene practices."
Empowering athletes to achieve the extraordinary - Airbus,"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTAzLWVtcG93ZXJpbmctYXRobGV0ZXMtdG8tYWNoaWV2ZS10aGUtZXh0cmFvcmRpbmFyedIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"High-level sport is much like high-tech industry, where innovation, precision and attention to detail play a key role. And Paralympic Fencing is no exception, as French Paralympic foil and sabre fencer Maxime Valet well knows.

Now 35, Maxime Valet has been fencing for 25 years – first when he was able-bodied and then with a wheelchair, following an accident 15 years ago. A double bronze medallist at the 2016 Paralympic Games in Rio, Maxime came to an obvious conclusion. With his average build, if he wanted to maintain his chances of success in the face of ever-steeper competition, then he needed to find a way to extend his reach when delivering an attack.

The wheelchair plays a key role in this discipline, as Maxime explains: “We are all constantly seeking technical improvements that could give us the competitive edge. I’m quicker and more technical than many of my opponents but have less of a reach than some. So I tried to work out ways of extending my lunge.”

Having an idea is one thing, putting it into action is another. Which is where Airbus came in. Contacted via the company’s disability service Mission Handicap, the challenge was quickly seized by Airbus’ Humanity Lab – a philanthropic-minded network of Airbus volunteers who contribute to innovative projects with a positive impact on society. It wasn’t unknown territory, since the Lab had already worked on a wheelchair for France national Para-Badminton team member David Toupé,

Several employees volunteered to dedicate some of their free time to the project, as its coordinator and R&T Innovation Catalyst Vanessa Crespo explains.

“The process took several months because we first took the time to watch Maxime in action, in order to fully understand what he required.”

Next came the study, design and development phases, from ergonomic analysis of the athlete’s movements to scans of his wheelchair. This information helped to create a 3D model featuring in particular the mapping of Maxime’s movements and the precise dimensions of his wheelchair.

“After discussing these elements with Maxime, together we agreed to equip his chair with a grip that would enable him to increase his range,” says Christophe Debard, Head of ProtoSpace Toulouse at Airbus. Digitally designed by the Airbus Design teams, the grip was produced then mounted on the chair so that Maxime could test it. “After two or three tryouts, he was able to start training in March 2020”, adds Vanessa.

What happened next proved them all right, as Maxime proudly explains. “We kept the grip a secret for a long time in order to create the effect of surprise and avoid it being copied, and it played a key role during several matches at the 2021 Games in Tokyo. It enabled me to win my third Paralympic medal: the Team Bronze.”

Currently in the qualification phase of the next Paralympics, to be held in Paris in 2024, Maxime is still hard at work, backed by both the Humanity Lab and France’s national sports agency the Agence Nationale du Sport – a public interest group created after Paris was awarded the 2024 Games, to help athletes, coaches and sports federations improve their daily performance.

So we’ll have to wait until next year to find out what new innovations this collaboration brings and whether they prove successful."

Turbulence alert - The collaborative network | News - Airbus Aircraft,"Wed, 08 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vYWlyY3JhZnQuYWlyYnVzLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzcm9vbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMtMDMtdHVyYnVsZW5jZS1hbGVydC10aGUtY29sbGFib3JhdGl2ZS1uZXR3b3Jr0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Turbulence can put stress on passengers, crew and aircraft. In worst cases, it can also lead to injuries as well as aircraft damage.

What if pilots had more advance warning and more precise data about upcoming turbulence thanks to a collaborative digital solution? What if they could prepare themselves and their passengers and even avoid the zone altogether?

Better predictions for better planning

In an effort to avoid turbulence, flight operations and flight crew try to anticipate and/or create the best trajectory, during the flight planning phase or whilst in flight. To do this, they need accurate data about turbulence, both current and forecasted.

Today, weather forecasting for turbulence is not always accurate enough. However, collecting data from aircraft in flight and actually experiencing turbulence, could improve accuracy for following aircraft. The key is data-sharing. We need to collect and share fleet-wide turbulence records using inputs from as wide a network as possible.

The expected benefits are clear:

Increased level of safety, reducing risk of passenger/crew injuries or aircraft damage.

Greater comfort for passengers and crew.

More optimised flight plans.

More optimised fuel burn, through improved turbulence forecasts.

Cross-aircraft collaboration

Road navigation apps enable drivers to alert others in real time about traffic issues. Similarly, what if an aircraft actually experiencing turbulence could quickly and automatically communicate precise data to other aircraft? This means that following aircraft would be forewarned and could even adapt their flight plans to avoid the turbulence, augmenting PIREPs (Pilot Reporting) with objective, atmospheric turbulence measurements.

Turbulence EDR* (Eddy Dissipation Rate) reporting and sharing enables enhanced situational awareness and decision-making. Avionics software collects data from the aircraft and computes Turbulence EDR, sends it to the IATA ground platform where all data is crosschecked, and shared with follower aircraft.

*EDR (Eddy Dissipation Rate) is a measure of the turbulent state of the atmosphere, independent of the aircraft. EDR has been adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) since 2001 as the standard metric for atmospheric turbulence.

This turbulence measurement provides:

- accurate, objective, automated, information, independent of the aircraft type

- more precision on the turbulence area, altitudes and level

- more precision on the smooth air areas

This means flight teams can choose optimal flight paths and altitudes, as well as accurately communicate to passengers and cabin attendants.

How it works

A turbulence report algorithm is implemented in the Airbus AOC part of the ATSU system on the A320/A330, and in the ACMS on the A350.*

*AOC Aeronautical Operational Control

ATSU Air Traffic Service Unit

ACMS Aircraft Condition Monitoring System

It collects data from inertial systems and computes turbulence reports which can be sent by Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) or (ACARS Over IP) to the airline or directly to the IATA platform.

This software can be installed:

- either by a dematerialised software installation on A320/A330

- or a Software Pin Programming (SPP) activation on A350

SESAR solution

R&D studies have been conducted in the frame of a SESAR project* to develop an EDR prototype of the solution and to study the exchange and use of the data on the ground, eg. Operations Control Centre (OCC) services in Europe.

*SESAR project Solution 110 - Aircraft as a Meteorological and Aeronautical Information Services (AIS) producer and consumer.

This project has received funding from the SESAR Joint Undertaking under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 874478.

IATA’s Turbulence Aware Team tells more about using the system

Q1: What do airlines already collaborating with the IATA platform consider to be the main benefits?

Users see EDR reporting or real-time turbulence reporting as a paradigm shift towards data-driven turbulence mitigation. The EDR objective intensity value associated with a precise 4D location (longitude, latitude, time and altitude) constitutes the value proposition of the dataset when compared to the usual way of reporting turbulence (PIREPs).



By integrating the global EDR dataset into existing tools typically used in dispatch and flight deck, they can tactically and strategically use it to improve situational awareness and safety outcomes by avoiding potential turbulence encounters.



The EDR dataset and the real-time wind and temperature information can also be used for fuel optimization purposes. The dataset can also be used as an additional data layer to potentially avoid unnecessary AOGs related to a severe turbulence report log from the crew and safety-related investigations.

Q2: What is the interest for IATA in the implementation of the EDR algorithm proposed by Airbus on its A320, A330 and A350 aircraft?

Having the solution available as both a line-fit and retrofit on the Airbus family will support IATA’s effort to grow the airline reporting capability and streamline implementation. Consequently, it will accelerate the Turbulence Aware global EDR dataset development by allowing airlines to report data from most of the Airbus models.

The Turbulence EDR report function helps improve the comfort and safety of passengers and crew, the fuel burn consumption and the knowledge of turbulence.

It also enables a collaborative and standardised approach for different aircraft types, which will benefit all airlines choosing to implement it on their fleet. In the face of weather hazards and CO2 emission challenges, it contributes to a safe and a sustainable future.

Several airlines are already using the solution, particularly in North America. To join the network, airlines can contact Airbus for the installation of the function and IATA for access to the Turb Aware Platform."

Getafe, 28 March 2023 – The NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) has ordered an additional Airbus A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT), increasing the Multinational MRTT Fleet (MMF) to 10 aircraft.

This announcement follows Belgium’s decision to increase its number of hours in the programme with an additional 1,100 flight hours per year. The Multinational Multi Role Tanker Transport Fleet (MMF) provides strategic transport, air-to-air refuelling and medical evacuation capabilities to its six participating nations: Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Luxembourg, The Netherlands and Norway. These Nations signed the Memorandum of Understanding that enables them to share costs proportionally according to the national commitment of flight hours per year.

“Since the arrival of the first aircraft in 2020 and especially since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, the MMF is protecting European sovereignty and showing its capabilities as a multirole tanker,” said Jean Brice Dumont, Head of Military Air Systems at Airbus Defence and Space. “With this new order, NSPA has already acquired one out of four optional MRTTs requested beyond the nine aircraft contracted earlier, demonstrating the level of customer satisfaction.”

MMU already operates seven A330 MRTTs and reached Initial Operational Capability ceremony on March 23rd. Full Operational Capability is expected in mid-2024.

Its success relies on the excellent cooperation between NATO, the participating nations and industry. The programme also stands as an example on how nations can cooperate, pooling and sharing resources to get ongoing access to state of the art capabilities.

The unit has been deployed in NATO's Eastern Flank, as well as for the evacuation of Afghanistan civilians and refugees and for multinational exercises in the Indo-Pacific region with the German Air Force, among other missions.

Two of the tankers yet to be delivered are expected to enter service in 2024, while this new aircraft will arrive at the end of 2026. The MRTTs from MMF operate from MMU Main Operating Base (MOB) in Eindhoven (Netherlands) and the Forward Operating Base (FOB) in Cologne (Germany).

Keeping Safety First: A Statistical Analysis of Commercial Aviation Accidents - Airbus,"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTAzLWtlZXBpbmctc2FmZXR5LWZpcnN0LWEtc3RhdGlzdGljYWwtYW5hbHlzaXMtb2YtY29tbWVyY2lhbC1hdmlhdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The safety of our products and the people who fly or operate them has always been the number one priority for Airbus. Compiling and analysing data1 of the incidents and accidents which occurred helps to contribute to improving the safety of our products by identifying trends or emerging threats that can be acted upon to prevent accidents from happening.

The focus of the Statistical Analysis of Commercial Aviation Accidents is on Western built jets with over 40 seats. It shows that there were around 27 million flight departures in 2022, which was an increase of almost 5 million when compared with 2021. This is still around 20% below the number of flights recorded prior to the pandemic.

The document reports that the aviation sector shows a positive trend towards a recovery of traffic to pre-pandemic levels. This ramp-up also highlights the need to attract more aviation professionals across the industry to avoid any shortfall, especially in light of the global workforce requirements for the next 20 years. “In order to secure safe and efficient operations in 2023 and beyond, it is fundamental for the industry to maintain and develop competencies of all aviation professionals and permanently reinforce our safety culture,” says Yannick Malinge, Chief Product Safety Officer for Airbus Commercial Aircraft.

The analysis also points out that 2022 was a year that reported six commercial jet hull loss accidents without fatalities and two fatal accidents that were due to vehicles entering the runway. There was also a fatal accident where all passengers and crews lost their lives that remains to be classified, and therefore, is not yet recorded in this year’s analysis. “As the number of accidents and flights will vary each year, accident rates are more relevant than reviewing the number of accidents per year when analyzing trends”, the document reads. In this context, the statistics show that the number of accidents today is significantly lower than a comparable year in the previous decade and the rate of fatal accidents and hull losses is steadily decreasing over time.

The analysis shows how “accident rates were further reduced with the introduction of new technologies that helped to reduce accident rates for each generation of aircraft”. The largest percentage of flights in recent years were made using the latest generation 4 fly-by-wire commercial jets, which have the lowest accident rate. “In 2022, generation 4 commercial jet aircraft flew 56% of the flights and the accident rate for both generation 3 and 4 aircraft remained historically low.” Comparing accident rates by generation of aircraft illustrates the value of the investments made through technology to improve safety, ensuring that taking a flight in a commercial jet aircraft is a low-risk activity.

Daily flights from Munich to Boston will be operated by LH424. Just in time for Independence Day, the U.S. national holiday, an A380 with the flight number LH410 will take off daily for New York to John F. Kennedy International Airport from July 4, 2023. The airline is thus noticeably expanding its premium offering at its southern hub, especially with additional seats in Business and First Class.

With 509 seats, the A380 has around 80 percent more capacity than the Airbus A340-600 currently flying on the Munich-New York (JFK) route. In total, the A380 offers four classes of travel: 8 seats in First Class, 78 seats in Business Class, 52 seats in Premium Eco and 371 seats in Economy Class.

Flights on the largest aircraft in the Lufthansa fleet can be booked from March 23, 2023.

Due to the significant increase in demand for airline tickets and the delayed delivery of ordered aircraft, Lufthansa had decided in 2022 to reactivate the Airbus A380, which is particularly popular with passengers and crews.

Airbus demos in-flight autonomous guidance of target drone with tanker - C4ISRNET,"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmM0aXNybmV0LmNvbS91bm1hbm5lZC8yMDIzLzAzLzI4L2FpcmJ1cy1kZW1vcy1pbi1mbGlnaHQtYXV0b25vbW91cy1ndWlkYW5jZS1vZi10YXJnZXQtZHJvbmUtd2l0aC10YW5rZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MILAN — Airbus Defence and Space, in cooperation with the company’s subsidiary UpNext, said it successfully demonstrated autonomous guidance and control of a Do-DT25 target drone using an A310 aircraft during test flights in Spain.

On March 21, UpNext performed its first flight-test campaign toward the development of autonomous and uncrewed air-to-air refueling technologies as part of its Auto’Mate project.

The A310 Multi-Role Tanker Transport test bed took off at the company’s site in Getafe while four DT25 multipurpose target drones, acting as receiver aircraft, were launched back to back from the Arenosillo Test Centre in Huelva.

Once over the waters of the Gulf of Cadiz, the control of the unmanned aircraft passed over from a ground station to the tanker, which autonomously guided it to an in-flight refueling position.

“The first flight test lasted about six hours, where a total of four launched receivers were sequentially controlled and commanded via artificial intelligence and cooperative control without human interaction,” Borja García de Sola, external communications manager at Airbus Defence and Space, told reporters. “The different receivers were then controlled until they were at a minimum recorded distance of 150 feet from the A310.”

A second test flight under the same concept, with four DT25 drones and an A310 tanker, also took place on March 23. Together, the systems flew about 12 hours using eight unmanned aircraft.

Both types of aircraft were integrated with Auto’Mate demonstrator technologies including cameras, light detection and ranging — otherwise known as LiDAR — and high-precision GPS to monitor the position, speed and altitudes between them; intra-flight communication systems; and cooperative control algorithms to provide coordination and consensus.

During the briefing, company officials revealed that a second campaign will take place at the end of 2023, with trial flights carried out at the same location.

While in the first push, the company controlled the receivers in two different configurations and autonomously guided them to different positions with diverse navigation sources, the second will focus on more in-depth testing of AI for navigation and autonomous flight.

In addition, the latter will include two simulated drones flying in the proximity of the tanker aircraft to demonstrate multi-receiver autonomous operations and collision-avoidance algorithms, García de Sola explained.

These experiments are paving the way toward achieving what the company refers to as autonomous assets air-to-air refueling, defined as the ability to independently transfer and receive fuel midair. That so-called A4R system allows for the refueling of several aircraft simultaneously and at a faster rate, reduces the size of tanker crew, and enables extended-range missions for the drones.

Airbus deliveries for Jan-2023 comprised two A220s, 16 A320s, one A330 and A350.

The delivery total was down 33% compared to Jan-2022, and the slowest rate of monthly deliveries for Airbus since Apr-2020.

Airbus expects to deliver 'around 720' aircraft in 2023 as problems across the global supply chain meant that in 2022 it 'lost a year"" in its recovery.

Deliveries are expected to be weighted to 2H2023, with narrowbodies accounting for most of the 2023 increase.

Early 2023 performance disappointment after Airbus misses 2022 delivery targets

Airbus deliveries for Jan-2023 comprised two A220s, 16 A320s, one A330 and A350. This was down 33% compared to Jan-2022, and the slowest rate of monthly deliveries for Airbus since Apr-2020.

The slowdown was not unexpected - January is historically the slowest month of the year for Airbus in terms of deliveries - but it came after Airbus had finished 2022 with a flurry of activity, managing to deliver 68 aircraft in November and 98 aircraft in December.

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury was reportedly displeased with the performance. The European OEM has been hoping to avoid a repeat of its disappointing 2022, when it shipped 661 aircraft.

Although this was up 8% compared to 2022, it was significantly below the targets that Airbus had set itself through the year.

Airbus monthly deliveries: Sep-2015 to Jan-2023

Airbus had initially expected to deliver around 720 aircraft for 2022. However, events over the early part of the year - particularly the OMICRON COVID-19 wave and subsequent lockdowns in China, along with the Ukraine-Russia conflict - meant that Airbus had revised this target down to ""around 700"" as of the middle of the year.

Interconnected aerospace supply chain issues continued to bubble up through 2022. These created ongoing production challenges for Airbus through the year, forcing the OEM to divert resources into smoothing out problems and to adapt production plans to match supply.

The most noticeable were delays in deliveries of engines for the popular A320 and A220 narrowbody aircraft families. CFM International and Pratt & Whitney also faced supply chain challenges, reporting delays in parts deliveries of two months or more, with shortages of trained staff and industrial unrest contributing to operational difficulties.

As well as this, Airbus also reported computer chip shortages reduced supply for a range of electronics items. Sections of the supply chain were also affected by high energy prices and shortages of certain raw materials - particularly titanium - which led to delays with deliveries of castings, forgings, and even carbon fibre composites.

2023 production outlook a 2022 redo

On 16-Feb-2023 Airbus announced a familiar target of ""around 720"" deliveries for the new year.

Mr Faury noted that while things had ""stabilised"" in Dec-2022, problems across the global supply chain meant that Airbus had ""lost a year"" in its recovery.

The supply chain still has not recovered as anticipated, and Airbus has taken this into consideration with its revised plans. The OEM now has a ""very deep and granular"" understanding of the problems faced with its ramp-up, according to Mr Faury.

Deliveries are expected to be weighted to 2H2023, with Airbus projecting that its production activities will ramp up through the year as supply chain problems are progressively resolved.

Narrowbodies will account for most of the increase in deliveries for 2023

A320neo production is expected to increase from approximately 43 per month to 50 per month by the end of 2023, before going to 60 per month in 1H2024.

Airbus had been targeting an increase to 65 A320 deliveries per month by around mid-2024, but this has now been pushed back to a late 2024 target.

A320 production (6 month rolling average): Jan-2016 to Jan-2023

Airbus has also pushed its timeline for the ramp-up of A320neo production to 75 aircraft per month from the ""middle of the decade"" to 2026. This will be supported by converting the old A380 production line in Hamburg to produce A321neo aircraft, with the first deliveries from this site expected by the end of 2023.

Widebody aircraft output will also be increased

The OEM has also announced plans that widebody aircraft output will be increased.

This is something that the manufacturer had been signalling by late 2022 - thanks to a better-than-forecast return of long haul travel and anticipation about the reopening of the Asia Pacific.

A330 production will be raised by 25%, going from three to four per month during 2024.

A350 output will be lifted by 50% by the end of 2025, going from six to nine per month.

The decision on increased output was made ""following a feasibility study with the supply chain"" according to Airbus, although this rate is still short of the 10 per month the OEM was producing before the pandemic.

Airbus annual deliveries: 2012 to 2022

Air India's blockbuster order underlines positive 2023 outlook for manufacturers

While Airbus gets its production activities and supply chain in order, the manufacturer continues to enjoy a strong environment for ordering.

Airbus won 1078 orders in 2022 (2021: 771 aircraft), although this fell to 820 after cancellations (2021: 507 aircraft).

Airbus started the year with 37 new orders for Jan-2023, all for A320neo and A220 narrowbody aircraft.



However, it was Air India's blockbuster commitment to order 470 aircraft - 250 from Airbus and 220 from Boeing - that won all the attention in Feb-2023.

From Airbus, Air India plans to order 140 A320neo and 70 A321neo narrowbody aircraft, as well as 34 A350-1000 and six A350-900 widebodies. Deliveries will start in late 2023, with A350-900s.

As of the end of Jan-2023, Airbus firm order backlog was 7255 aircraft, back up from an Oct-2021 low of around 6850 aircraft.

As orders have risen and airlines have seen passenger traffic come back, ordering has also returned (and pressure to raise output has also increased).

Airbus: commercial aircraft order backlog (Jan-2019 to Jan-2023)

With global passenger demand persisting despite a dark macroeconomic outlook, and China reopening its borders to travel, Airbus is confident of a ""solid"" 2023.

Mr Faury believes the outlook for ordering is ""really good"", and the aircraft market has now shifted to one where demand is stronger than supply - a position that seemed unlikely as little as 12 months ago.

Airbus will need to live up to expectations though - as global air travel closes in on full recovery, airline and leasing company customers are becoming increasingly frustrated with the slow ramp-up in output."
Constellations of opportunities - Airbus,"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTAzLWNvbnN0ZWxsYXRpb25zLW9mLW9wcG9ydHVuaXRpZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Innovative and affordable satellite platforms

The OneWeb constellation was only the first step. Using the industrial knowhow developed over the past six years, Airbus is able to offer an innovative and affordable satellite platform which is tailored for such high-performance space applications as connectivity, communications, and machine-to-machine (M2M) services, along with Earth observation, reconnaissance, and maritime/aviation relay.

“Airbus is bringing a true revolution for the satellite manufacturing industry, benefitting from our ability to optimise the entire satellite ecosystem – from payloads and platforms to end-to-end space systems,” said Jean Marc Nasr, Head of Space Systems at Airbus. “The real impact will be felt in what these systems can enable and their ability to change the world. Airbus is proud to be part of this story.”

In America, Airbus US is providing its next generation satellite platform to Northrop Grumman for the U.S. Space Development Agency’s prototype military data and connectivity constellation. The platforms will expand the current Airbus satellite design, providing more power and accommodating a larger payload in a modular solution. This will enable Airbus to offer a scalable 300-500 kg. spacecraft bus, as well as for future U.S. government missions.

Airbus is also supporting the ‘new space’ economy as a supplier to Loft Orbital – a space sector startup – which is creating a ‘satellite as a service’ business model. These platforms will be produced by Airbus for Loft Orbital, who see this innovative platform as an enabler to meet a wide range of missions and applications while offering even longer lifetimes in orbit.

Constellations are also a hot topic in Europe with the recent announcement that the European Union is pressing ahead with its own multi-orbit constellation which will act as a vector of European sovereignty for secure connectivity and resilience in an increasingly contested world - and Airbus intends to harness its end-to-end system expertise in shaping this future."

“This is a technology with incredible promise. It is 100% electric, [and] it can fundamentally change the way we’re delivering air services in our communities,” Balkiz Sarihan, head of urban air mobility at Airbus, said during HAI Heli-Expo 2023. “When we step back and we think about what would be the best use cases for such a technology, we look no further than medical services.”

The Norwegian Air Ambulance is the country’s national helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS) operator, currently flying a fleet of Airbus H135 and H145 helicopters.

“The Norwegian Air Ambulance Foundation has always been at the forefront of medical innovation, most recently with dedicated research to integrate a CT scanner into a five-bladed H145 helicopter,” Sarihan said.

Through the partnership, the companies will develop a concept of operations (CONOPS) to outline how eVTOL aircraft can be utilized in air medical operations.

The work will also involve simulating various air medical scenarios to map out the medical eVTOL ecosystem. Findings will ultimately help inform the aerospace company on the operational requirements that need to be configured in its eVTOL aircraft.

“Airbus’ aviation expertise across the board is a major asset to help us combine different aircraft for medical services,” said Hans-Morten Lossius, secretary general of the Norwegian Air Ambulance Foundation.

Lossius asserts that “helicopters remain essential to perform EMS missions,” but eVTOL technology can play a complementary role in supporting first responders with the aim to reduce emergency response time and improve patient outcome. This could include using the CityAirbus NextGen to transport medical staff or human organs.

Along with HEMS missions, Airbus is currently working with partners in Germany to develop a CONOPS for urban air mobility passenger services through its Air Mobility Initiative.

Powered by eight propellers and 16 electrical power units, the CityAirbus NextGen is still in development, with Airbus intending to build its demonstrator for first test flights in 2024."

Airbus is hoping to deliver 720 aircraft this year.

Airbus deliveries bounced modestly back in February following a poor January as the group announced on Tuesday it delivered 46 commercial aircraft to clients and also took 99 new orders.

The European plane manufacturer had been fighting to claw back post-pandemic ground as suppliers struggled to meet the ramp-up the group is hoping for.

But the manufacturer delivered 39 A320 jets over 16 in January. It aims to produce 65 per month by the end of 2024 and 75 monthly by 2026.

In addition, Airbus said it handed over three A220 single-aisle planes, two A330 long-haul and two A350 wide-body aircraft to customers last month.

Deliveries comprise a reliable indicator of aerospace profitability as customers pay most of the bill on taking possession of the planes.

The health crisis severely weakened the global chain of aircraft suppliers -– of which Airbus has more than 10,000—with recruitment problems adding to supply tensions.

Disruptions in global logistics and the energy crisis caused by the invasion of Ukraine were further factors weighing on the sector.

Airbus is hoping to deliver 720 aircraft this year—a target it initially had set for 2022.

Regarding orders, the manufacturer has reinstated a Qatar Airways order for 50 A320s and 23 A350s in its order book after cancelling it amid a dispute with the Gulf company settled out of court early last month.

Airbus also furthermore recorded an order from British Airways for 10 A320s and 16 other A320 orders for various unidentified customers.

In total, nineteen H125s were booked for law enforcement missions in 2022.

“Over the past decade, more than 75% of all single-engine law enforcement deliveries in North America have been Airbus H125 helicopters,” said Treg Manning, Vice President of Sales and Marketing for Airbus Helicopters North America. “Law enforcement agencies continue to choose the H125 because of the high performance, reliability and versatility it offers as an aircraft well adapted for multi-role missions.”

Notable new bookings in 2022 were made by existing Airbus customer York Regional Police, as well as new Airbus customers Kansas Highway Patrol and Maryland Department of Natural Resources Police.

York Regional Police opted to upgrade to an H125 from their current EC120 which they have used since 2002. The aircraft will be used for law enforcement missions in Ontario, Canada including speed patrol, suspect surveillance and pursuit, and search and rescue.

Kansas Highway Patrol ordered an H125 helicopter as an addition to their fleet. They will use the H125 for missions including search and rescue, vehicle pursuits, emergency response, counter-drug missions, and transporting vital equipment, personnel and assets.

The Maryland Department of Natural Resources Police also placed an order for an H125. The new helicopter will prove to be a powerful conservation enforcement tool, replacing the Bell 206 they previously operated. Officers will use the H125 to patrol public lands and waters, ensuring the safety of visitors and the protection of natural resources.

Airbus continues to be the leading provider of new helicopters to law enforcement agencies, with more than 60% of all North American law enforcement aircraft deliveries in the past decade being Airbus products.

Orders previously announced include Phoenix Police Department which opted to replace a fleet of four AS350 B3 helicopters with a fleet of five H125s. Metropolitan Nashville Police Department added two H125s to their fleet last year, replacing the MD 500s they had previously operated. Kern County Sheriff’s Office will also acquire two Airbus H125s to replace their current MD 500 and OH-58 helicopters, as announced at Heli-Expo 2022.

Careers take flight with the Airbus/CEMS partnership - Airbus,"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTAzLWNhcmVlcnMtdGFrZS1mbGlnaHQtd2l0aC10aGUtYWlyYnVzY2Vtcy1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In attracting the brightest minds as new employees, Airbus places a high priority on interacting with promising students and graduates – as one-third of the company’s open positions are for early career profiles.

Appealing to students from a range of institutions is a central pillar of Airbus’ campus engagement strategy, and it partners with key universities and organisations worldwide.

One such academic organisation is CEMS, a global alliance of leading business schools and corporate institutions that unites their respective resources in the offering of a master’s degree in international management. This month, Airbus continued its relationship with CEMS by renewing its partnership agreement.

As a CEMS partner, Airbus takes an active role in shaping curriculum content for this degree, as well as directly contributing with guest lectures, skill seminars and business projects – ensuring that the alliance’s educational activities remain relevant to industry needs.



“Seeking graduates with promising profiles and the right mindset”

Through the partnership, Airbus reaches graduates with profiles matching the company’s needs for future employees: knowledge of complex, international business with management and leadership competencies, skills in decision-making and problem-solving, with a mindset of ethics and integrity.

An alumnus of the CEMS programme is Christine Bertoldi, the Customisation Manager for passenger cabin seats at Airbus Commercial Aircraft. Based on her experience with CEMS, she gives high marks to the partnership – including the shared projects that offer expert mentoring and career shaping.

Having originally studied as an aircraft manufacturing mechanic, Christine wanted to shift her focus to engineering. She found CEMS particularly attractive because of its combination as a prestigious business school and the emphasis on linguistics – enabling her to work comfortably in an international environment where such languages as English, French and Spanish are spoken – in addition to her native German.

Just as importantly, the CEMS experience enabled Christine to achieve her goal of moving into engineering, as today she is the interface between the manufacturers of passenger seats and the airlines that acquire them to outfit their Airbus-built aircraft.

“At Airbus, I was able to combine my previous mechanical knowledge with new management skills I learned with CEMS, supported by my competence in multiple languages,” she explained. “The CEMS programme fully prepared me to work in an international environment and not be afraid of change.”

For graduates seeking a rewarding career path, Christine said Airbus is a great place to work. “Airbus has an extremely broad diversity of very cool products and services, with so many opportunities to grow in areas that range from production and engineering to sales and marketing.”"
Airbus developing IFR capability for H125 - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 08 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWRldmVsb3BpbmctaWZyLWNhcGFiaWxpdHktZm9yLWgxMjUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters is developing an instrument flight rules (IFR) capability for the H125 AStar, with a plan to certify the system in 2024.

Airbus believes the law enforcement/public services market, along with the air medical sector, will be keen to have a single-engine IFR aircraft. Mike Reyno Photo

The capability is being developed in partnership with Genesys Aerosystems, and will include an upgraded cockpit with dual IDU-680 EFIS displays, Genesys VHF NAV/COM aircraft digital radio, Genesys IFR helicopter autopilot, dual redundant ADAHRS, dual GPS/FMS, and other equipment.

The system will be certified first with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) by the second half of 2024, and offered with new deliveries in North America. The company aims to then seek further approvals with other regulators, with Brazil the next target.

The development of the capability for a single-engine airframe follows in the footsteps of Bell’s 407GXi and Leonardo’s TH-119/TH-73A Thrasher.

While Leonardo expressed doubts about the size of the civil market for a single-engine IFR aircraft in a press conference the day before the announcement, Airbus believes the size of the H125’s global fleet would mean there is sufficient demand for the development.

“The market of the 125 is broad enough to have enough customers on this specific platform to make the development worth it,” Matthieu Louvot, executive vice president of programs at Airbus Helicopters, told media during a briefing.

“It comes [as part of] a set of developments to enhance the all-weather all-time capability of our helicopters,” he said. “On many helicopters, we want to reduce the percentage of days where you just can’t fly because of the weather.”

According to Airbus, there are close to 4,200 H125 family aircraft flying around the world. Last year, it received 161 orders for the type.

“Our goal is to make our products better step-by-step, and clearly the strategy on the H125, the next step is to make the H125 IFR capable,” said Romain Trapp, CEO of Airbus Helicopters Inc. — the manufacturer’s U.S. subsidiary. “We have seen some demand from customers. Where it’s going to go at the end, I think we don’t know, but we want to be ready to answer the demand.”

Trapp added that the demand the manufacturer has seen to date has been “mainly on the EMS [emergency medical services] side” of the industry, but Airbus also believes law enforcement/public services operators will be keen to have the capability.

“Our responsibility is to listen to the market, to listen to our customers, and to ensure that we provide the answer to their need,” said Bruno Even, president and CEO of Airbus Helicopters. “Yes, perhaps, it could be that it’s not the need for all the markets, but we want in position for every part of the market.”

The manufacturer and partner Genesys revealed the news during the first day of HAI Heli-Expo 2023 in Atlanta, Georgia.

“Genesys is excited to partner with Airbus to offer an avionics solution to the H125 that allows an affordable option for IFR operations,” said Jamie Luster, Genesys Aerosystems director of sales and marketing, in a press release. “We expect the IFR option to be a popular choice in civil and special mission applications.”"

Karl climbs into his cockpit. His mission today: to assess new functionalities and technologies for use in a next generation fighter jet. These include: a touchscreen human-machine interface that allows him to assign tasks to a swarm of drones, or remote carriers as they are known in the military, and an augmented reality system that displays information such as reconnaissance and other mission participant’s data as well as the status of the remote carriers - all of which his jet is connected to via a data cloud called the ‘Combat Cloud’.

What sounds like science fiction today will be reality in 2040. This is because such technologies will be flying in the Future Combat Air System, or FCAS for short, which will by then be operational in France, Germany and Spain and will gradually replace existing combat aircraft such as the Eurofighter or the Rafale. FCAS will be centred around a core Next Generation Weapon System (NGWS). In this ‘system of systems’, a New Generation Fighter (NGF) will work together with remote carriers (RC) and be connected to other systems in space, in the air, on the ground, at sea and in cyberspace via a data link and mission service cloud.

Karl, a former German Air Force weapon system officer, is part of a Franco-German-Spanish team at Airbus testing how it all works at the company's FCAS Prototyping Laboratory (FPL) in Manching, near Munich. Karl is not actually sitting in a real jet, but flying virtual missions in a simulator. “We research and work on solutions that don’t exist yet, but will be required in the future,” Karl explains. “Through these virtual missions, we gain ‘hands-on experience’ that helps us refine and assess new technologies and concepts as well as identify their technical, operational and integrational readiness,” adds Johannes Horn, Chief Engineer FCAS Simulation and Virtualization. “This eventually allows us to integrate the best solutions into the design and development of FCAS.""

Five years to the demonstrator's first flight

The clock is ticking, and Demonstrator Phase 1B is now in full swing: by 2025 the FCAS flight demonstrators will have been further developed. Demo Phase 2 will then see them take off for the first time: the remote carrier demonstrator in 2028 and the New Generation Fighter demonstrator in 2029. The production phase is scheduled to begin in the 2030s.

Including the FPL team, Airbus currently has 250 people working on the FCAS and plans to have 800 doing so by the end of 2023. “We want to fill the new positions with both internal and external candidates,” says Bruno Fichefeux, head of FCAS programme at Airbus, adding that 80 per cent of them will work in Engineering. Working on FCAS is rewarding, both for experienced and new talents, says Fichefeux: ""After all, it’s not too often that you get the opportunity to work on the most important European defence project of the next decades.”

On the Airbus side, this will take place mainly in four plateaus or integrated work areas: in Manching, with a focus on the New Generation Fighter, Remote Carriers and stealth technologies; in Getafe near Madrid, where work is being done on the New Generation Fighter and stealth technologies; in Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance, where work is being done on the combat cloud and remote carriers; and in Elancourt near Paris, where teams are working on the overall system of systems and the combat cloud.

But how is collaboration with external partners set up? In the Phase 1B demonstration, it is divided into individual pillars (see infographic), each of which has a leading company with partners, according to the ""best athlete"" principle. Airbus, for example, is responsible for the remote carriers, combat cloud and stealth technologies. There will also be a plateau in Saint-Cloud, France, where Dassault Aviation will notably lead the New Generation Fighter pillar together with Airbus as a main partner.

In the FCAS Demonstrator Phase 1B, roles and responsibilities are clearly defined: For each pillar, there is a leader, a so-called ‘prime’, and ‘main partners’ who are involved in the developments. Airbus, for example, is responsible for the remote carriers, combat cloud and stealth technologies.

Europe gains autonomy

""As a European player in aerospace, collaboration is our daily business,"" Fichefeux says. After all, Airbus was founded on the very idea of working together to achieve what is impossible alone. ""Of course,"" says Fichefeux, ""cooperation is not always easy, but ultimately, we strive with our partners to achieve a common goal: to provide our customers with the best possible equipment to fulfil their military missions to protect and defend our democracies.”

But why does Europe need its own system to do this, why not just buy an existing one off the shelf, for example in the United States? “Firstly, there is no system yet that meets all the requirements,” Fichefeux explains. Second, he says, it’s about nothing less than European autonomy: ""Our air forces need to be able to operate where and when they think it’s strategically important, without black boxes in between. Not having that capability would be a tremendous loss of sovereignty.""

The FCAS Lab team uses simulators to fly virtual missions. The aim is to research and work on solutions that don't exist today, but will be needed in the future.

Working on the requirements of the future

Back at the FPL, in their touchscreen simulators with virtual head-up display cockpits, Karl and his colleagues are about to take out an enemy’s ground based air defence system supported by unmanned assets and smart algorithms. They are not flying the mission alone, but in a team with colleagues in other simulators at the FCAS Lab and at Airbus’ Spanish site in Getafe near Madrid, all networked together.

Blue (allies) versus red (threat) is the name of these exercises, which are designed to clarify the requirements that the future air combat system will have to meet. Conducting these exercises is no easy feat. They involve virtual cockpits built by Airbus Human Factors Engineering experts based on decades of experience (for further information, click on the video below). Added to that are virtual hostile forces challenging every carefully prepared mission plan, the simulation operators who closely evaluate whether their simulations behave correctly, and other experts who closely monitor the performance of their sub-systems and data to further mature their operational value and readiness. “Each exercise generates new ideas, matures concepts and provides hands-on experience of what a future digital engineering process might look like to maximise the system”, explains Johannes Horn.

Meanwhile, Karl and his colleagues at the FCAS Lab in Manching are carrying out their mission with aplomb. This time, Blue is winning, not least because in the simulation FCAS already has everything that it needs: plenty of speed, an extensive sensor grid and the collaborative firepower of all the networked systems involved.

Airbus UpNext has successfully demonstrated the in-flight autonomous guidance and control of an uncrewed aircraft through the A310 multi-role tanker transporter (MRTT) aircraft.

The announcement was shared by Airbus Defence and Space, the parent company of Airbus UpNext.

This achievement marks the first step in autonomous formation flight and air-to-air refuelling (A4R) capability. The demonstration further marks a key milestone for future air operations representing crewed and uncrewed teaming. It involved integration of Airbus’ Auto’Mate technology with an A310 MRTT flying testbed and on a number of DT-25 target drones that served as receiver aircraft.

Auto’Mate demonstrator can be used for minimising crew fatigue, while simultaneously reducing chances of human error.

The A310 tanker aircraft took-off from Getafe in Spain on 21 March, while the target drones flew from the Arenosillo Test Centre at Huelva, Spain.

After taking off from their respective places, the A310 aircraft took control of the drones from a ground station. This transitioning allowed MRTT to autonomously guide the DT-25 aircraft into the desired in-flight refuelling position.

The flight test was performed above the waters of the Gulf of Cadiz and lasted for around six hours. It involved successive launch of four receivers that were controlled and commanded with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) and cooperative control algorithms, with no human involvement.

Airbus Defence and Space Military Air Systems head Jean Brice Dumont said: “Even though we are at an early stage, we have achieved this within just one year and are on the right track for crewed-uncrewed teaming and future air force operations where fighters and mission aircraft will fly jointly with drone swarms.”

The next test for Auto’Mate technology is slated to be held by the end of this year. It will focus on the use of AI-based navigation sensors and improving algorithms for autonomous formation flight.

In another development, Airbus has received an order from the Nato Support and Procurement Agency to deliver the tenth A330 MRTT aircraft for the Multinational MRTT Fleet (MMF).

The new order follows an initial memorandum of understanding, signed by the MMF member nations last week.

The MMF Unit has already achieved initial operational capability, with the full operational capability expected in mid-2024."

Airbus drops deal with Atos digital unit after pressure from Chris Hohn - Financial Times,"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2Y0NzIyOWJjLTk5ODUtNDVjMy1hY2M2LTZiN2Y2MjQwMzQxYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Print this page

Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

Airbus has bowed to pressure from billionaire hedge fund manager Chris Hohn and pulled its bid to buy a minority stake in a unit of French IT services company Atos.

Shares in Atos closed down 17 per cent to €10.71 by late afternoon in Paris after the company confirmed that the European plane maker would no longer pursue talks to take a 29.9 per cent stake in Evidian, its digital and big data arm.

The loss of that option will pile pressure on Atos, something that will concern the French government because the company owns sensitive quantum computing assets and cyber defences that Paris considers to be strategic.

The investment by Airbus would have helped Atos carry out a planned split of its operations after a period of heavy losses.

Airbus had begun talks with Atos because it was interested in boosting digitalisation and tech development across its business, said a person familiar with the matter, but decided that buying a roughly 30 per cent stake in Evidian was not the best way forward.

Airbus would not have been able to run the business, which is in the middle of a turnround, even after having invested a significant amount.

But the two companies said in separate statements that they would continue to discuss other ways they could work together. Airbus stressed that a partnership had “the potential to create significant value for both companies”, something Atos repeated.

Atos said it would “explore other options with Airbus and keep working on a strategic and technology partnership for the long term”.

Airbus said it had concluded that taking a minority stake “does not meet the company’s objectives in the current context and under the current structure”.

The company stressed that this was “an independent decision by our board of directors and management which was not influenced by outside pressure or parties”.

Guillaume Faury, Airbus chief executive, had previously cautioned that the company would only progress with a transaction if it made sense “from a financial standpoint”.

The decision not to proceed comes after Hohn, whose TCI fund is one of the largest shareholders in the European plane maker, demanded it drop its interest, describing the proposed deal as a “bailout of Atos, a company that is burdened with unsustainable levels of debt and other liabilities”.

Hohn also questioned the use of management time on the transaction, arguing that Airbus should instead be focusing on meeting delivery targets for new aircraft.

TCI, which has a more than 3 per cent stake in Airbus and has been a shareholder since 2012, had filed a motion for the manufacturer to answer 16 questions relating to the transaction at its annual general meeting next month.

Atos had announced in June last year that it planned to split itself into two separate companies, a process it aimed to complete by mid-2023 at the earliest.

On one side would be the legacy IT services half of the business, called Tech Foundations, which had about €6bn in sales last year and a narrow operating profit.

The other side would be Evidian, which incorporates Atos’s digital, big data and security business activities. The business, which has about 60,000 employees and annual revenues of about €5bn, secures communications for France’s military among other customers.

The setback with Airbus could give an opening to other suitors for all or various parts of Atos to try to pressure the board to reconsider their offers.

Long wary of selling off Atos in parts, its chair Bertrand Meunier had rejected earlier interest from defence electronics group Thales for the big data and cyber security business. Atos also rejected last September an unsolicited offer for Evidian from rival onepoint and UK private equity fund ICG.

Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky has also been circling Tech Foundations, but is said to want to be paid hundreds of millions to take it over given its need for restructuring. A spokesperson for Kretinsky declined to comment.

On Wednesday, onepoint said it was “totally mobilised and would study all the possibilities of a deal for Evidian”.

Separately, Thales ruled itself out of the running: “As already stated, Thales said it has never been interested in buying a stake in Evidian and given that Atos’s big data and security business is not for sale, the group has moved ahead with other strategic priorities.”

The French government has been watching developments at Atos closely, said people close to the situation, and will aim to protect the strategic assets within the company. “They will take some comfort in the fact that the discussions are continuing between Atos and Airbus,” said one of the people.

CesiumAstro Unveils In-Flight Connectivity Satellite Communications Terminal with Planned Airbus Demonstrations - Space Ref,"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3NwYWNlcmVmLmNvbS9zcGFjZS1jb21tZXJjZS9jZXNpdW1hc3Ryby11bnZlaWxzLWluLWZsaWdodC1jb25uZWN0aXZpdHktc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWNvbW11bmljYXRpb25zLXRlcm1pbmFsLXdpdGgtcGxhbm5lZC1haXJidXMtZGVtb25zdHJhdGlvbnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CesiumAstro

As the leading designer of active phased array technology for low-Earth orbit (LEO) space, CesiumAstro will provide the industry’s first multi-beam make-before-break phased array supporting multiple Ka-band constellations for airborne commercial and defense markets.

The high-performance yet cost effective system is designed as a scalable solution for a wide range of airborne platforms spanning large commercial aircraft, business jets, helicopters, and unmanned aerial systems.

CesiumAstro’s new IFC system is scheduled for multiple flight demonstrations with Airbus commercial aircraft and helicopters. These demonstrations will showcase the scalability and flexibility of the solution and its ability to connect to multiple satellites and orbits at one time, enabling make-before-break handoff, and other key features that enhance overall quality of service.

“Airbus R&T is committed to evaluating the latest technologies in the industry so that we can provide our customers best in class connectivity,” said Olivier Hauw, leading Fast Track Connectivity at Airbus, “CesiumAstro’s flat panel array technology is at the cutting edge, and we look forward to working together further.”

CesiumAstro will begin demonstrations of its in-flight active phased array technology through 2023 and 2024 with testing moving from the ground to an Airbus helicopter.

SPIDER was designed as a two-flight mission, and its first launch was on New Year’s Day 2015. That first flight lasted 17 days, and scientists used its data to set an upper limit on the brightness of these primordial gravitational waves.

“We did not see them, but we set a strict constraint on how bright they can be,” Filippini said.

The payload from SPIDER’s first flight was recovered in November 2015, and many of those components were used to build the instruments for its second flight. But the latest SPIDER spacecraft is slightly different than its first iteration: this time, researchers added telescopes specifically designed to observe galactic dust.

“We have three new telescopes that are specifically designed to observe galactic dust… which will help us tease out the difference between the primordial signal we’re looking for and the dust, which could fake that signal,” Filippini said.

In-flight connectivity is a growing market, and we are developing the highest performing, most cost-effective solution that is timed to hit the market just as the latest Ka-band satellite constellations come online,” said Shey Sabripour, founder and CEO at CesiumAstro. “Being constellation-agnostic will provide our customers greater flexibility with a key differentiator being multi-beam capability without having to sacrifice performance.”

Today, most aircraft are flying with mechanically steered antenna technologies and are communicating through geostationary satellites. As the industry transitions to solid-state technologies, CesiumAstro’s Ka-band flat panel solution will be lower profile, lighter weight, lower cost, and more flexible than any other solutions available. This game-changing capability is built to be rugged enough to be flown in space, while leveraging commercial automotive manufacturing techniques to control costs and produce at scale while ensuring reliability.

United Airbus begins servicing Durango-La Plata County Airport - The Durango Herald,"Sun, 26 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR1cmFuZ29oZXJhbGQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3VuaXRlZC1haXJidXMtYmVnaW5zLXNlcnZpY2luZy1kdXJhbmdvLWxhLXBsYXRhLWNvdW50eS1haXJwb3J0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Increased passenger traffic prompts airline to move toward larger plane for flights to and from Denver

×

Passengers flying to Denver will have more room to move about the cabin as the Durango-La Plata County Airport welcomed its first flight from the United Airbus A319 on Sunday.

The commercial aircraft seats up to 126 passengers compared to the typical regional jet that carries 76 passengers. DRO Director of Aviation Tony Vicari said the move was made by United Airlines officials based on an increased travel demand at the airport.

United carried about 179,000 passengers at DRO in 2022, up 4% from 2021. Also, United was the market-share leader at DRO in 2022, carrying 49% of all passengers arriving and departing from Durango.

There are five to six flights between Denver and Durango daily, but only one flight will rely on the Airbus.

“As we continue to see strong demand in our market, it's been something that United has looked at for several years,” Vicari said. “They finally saw the metrics and the market really showed that it was worth giving a chance.”

×

Vicari said both United and American Airlines flights have had record-setting load factors during the last year. Load factor is the capacity of the plane filled with passengers.

He said both airlines have seen load factors in the 80% to 90% range. Often, 90% is considered full because airlines account for passengers who may have missed a flight and are scheduled for a later one. Historically, load factors had been in the 70% range for most flights departing from the airport.

“We are proud to be the only airline providing service from Durango to Denver,” said Matt Miller, United’s vice president for Airport Operations at Denver International Airport in a February news release. “As Colorado’s most prominent airline, this vital link gives Southwest Coloradans access to more than 150 one-stop destinations through Denver.”

Larger aircraft are more efficient for airlines because they offer more seating and decrease unit costs. According to the Aircraft Cost Calculator, if flown 650 hours per year, an airbus will cost an airline about $3.3 million per year. A regional jet would have cost about the same amount, but the airbus has greater passenger capacity.

The aircraft will mostly be used for the early morning flight to Denver, but depending on flight scheduling it may be used for later flights as well.

×

Vicari credits Durango’s strong economy through the COVID-19 pandemic as a reason why the area has seen an increase in visitors.

“We've seen that our market has responded really well post-pandemic and we continue to see a resilient economy here which is better than in other places,” he said. “Consequently, that demand has been really sustained.”

The airport did not need to make any changes to accommodate the aircraft. However, the larger aircraft means more passengers coming through the airport at one time which means there might be longer lines at the ticket counter or going through security.

But Vicari said airport staff can handle the increased volume. When air service through Frontier was still available at DRO, the airliner had flights that used an Airbus A320 that could seat up to 180 passengers.

He suggests that passengers arrive 90 minutes before their flight to make sure they account for any congestion issues.

The airbus is just one of the new changes coming to the Durango-La Plata County Airport. On April 25, the airport will host a formal groundbreaking for its terminal expansion plan.

The long-term plan is to replace the temporary tensile fabric tent that is used for the American Airlines terminal on the west wing of the building. Vicari said the tent covers 50% of the available square footage after the security checkpoint.

“As a temporary structure that has a finite shelf life and we're already over a decade into the life-cycle of that temporary structure,” he said. “We need to have a game plan to be able to backfill that square footage.”

Flight operated with Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Tianjin, 24 March 2023 – Airbushas delivered the first A321neo aircraft assembled at its Final Assembly Line Asia (FAL Tianjin) to China’s Juneyao Air in Tianjin, China. The aircraft is powered by Pratt & Whitney GTF engines and features 207 comfortable seats, 8 in Business and 199 in Economy class. Its delivery flight is to use a ten percent Sustainable Aviation Fuel blend in support of the green aviation strategy in China.

“Since we announced the commissioning of the first A321 aircraft at FAL Tianjin last November, the relevant final assembly activities and tests went on smoothly, showcasing the maturity of FAL Tianjin to quickly adapt to new products,” said George Xu, Airbus Executive Vice President and Airbus China CEO. “The successful delivery of the first A321 aircraft enables Airbus to honour the popularity of the aircraft for the China market and beyond - and the consistent trust and support from our customers. Airbus continues to expand and enhance its comprehensive cooperation with China’s aviation industry, underlining its long-term commitment to China to ensure customer proximity while supporting the global commercial aircraft production ramp-up.”

Airbus has four A320 Family final assembly facilities around the world: Hamburg, Germany; Toulouse, France; Tianjin, China; and Mobile, United States. With the conversion of the Tianjin facility last year, and with the newest facility about to complete its transformation in Toulouse, the global industrial system will be fully A321-capable, creating flexibility and agility to meet Airbus’ ramp up objectives and the rising market success of the A321 model.

Inaugurated in 2008, the FAL in Tianjin was the first Airbus commercial aircraft assembly line outside Europe. In the same year, the first aircraft sections arrived on site. Since its first A320 delivery in 2009, Airbus’ FAL in Tianjin has delivered more than 600 aircraft over its 14 years in operation. The A321neo is the longest-fuselage member of Airbus’ best-selling, single-aisle A320 Family, comfortably seating as many as 244 passengers, with a longest range reaching 4,700nm/8,700km. Featuring the widest single-aisle cabin in the sky, the A320neo Family offers at least 20 percent reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 as well as a 50 percent noise reduction compared to previous generation aircraft, thanks to incorporating the very latest technologies including new generation engines and Sharklets. By the end of January 2023, the A320neo Family had received over 8,600 firm orders from more than 130 customers worldwide.

The satellite will be an Airbus S250 optical satellite. Terms of the deal, announced March 3, were not disclosed.

Angola has already developed various applications using satellite imagery from Airbus Defence and Space, such as land use mapping, agriculture monitoring and maritime surveillance and also operates its own telecommunications satellite, Angosat-2.

Airbus said sovereign access to satellite imagery will contribute to infrastructure development, mapping natural resources, maritime surveillance, agriculture and population. It will also provide a better understanding of the origins and impacts of climate change on the economy. In addition, Airbus will provide comprehensive training for Angolan engineers.

“As Angola’s strategic partner for space, Airbus will deliver a latest-generation Earth observation satellite to support social and economic development including a range of strategic activities such as urban planning and management of precious mineral resources,” commented Jean-Marc Nasr, head of Space Systems at Airbus.

Airbus signed a similar deal earlier this year to build two EO satellites for Poland."

Airbus Defence and Space Partners with Kythera Space Solutions for OneSat Mission Sizing Software - Space Ref,"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3NwYWNlcmVmLmNvbS9zcGFjZS1jb21tZXJjZS9haXJidXMtZGVmZW5jZS1hbmQtc3BhY2UtcGFydG5lcnMtd2l0aC1reXRoZXJhLXNwYWNlLXNvbHV0aW9ucy1mb3Itb25lc2F0LW1pc3Npb24tc2l6aW5nLXNvZnR3YXJlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Kythera

Kythera Space Solutions (Kythera), the leading provider of dynamic management systems for next-generation payloads and SATCOM networks, has partnered with Airbus Defence and Space to develop advanced payload mission sizing software for Airbus’ OneSat Software-Defined Satellite (SDS).

The new OneSize product enables OneSat satellite customers to quickly plan, optimize, and evaluate the performance of the OneSat’s system performance including ground stations and user terminals. This can be done on-the-go on a standard laptop, independent from the operational ground segment.

Airbus’ OneSat satellite is a new breed of SDS satellite, with the ability to be fully reconfigured while in orbit. Capable of adjusting its coverage area, capacity, power, and frequency all “on the fly” to meet evolving mission scenarios, OneSat offers Airbus customers unprecedented flexibility to meet different mission needs.

“Software-defined satellites like OneSat are extraordinarily capable, but that flexibility is hard to prove and visualize,” noted Dr. Jeffrey Freedman, PhD, CEO of Kythera Space Solutions. “We’re proud to be able to provide Airbus customers an easy way to boil away the complexity and see exactly how the OneSat payload will perform.”

The new Airbus OneSize product, developed with Kythera, enables Airbus customers to explore the flexibility, power, and capability of OneSat. Ideal for pre-sizing and new business opportunities, OneSize takes as input a mission scenario, with various coverage regions, users, terminals, gateways, and mission constraints. Using a model of the OneSat payload and advanced optimization algorithms, OneSize quickly optimizes the OneSat payload to yield a beam laydown configuration, frequency and channel plans, and capacity to service the mission at hand. The result is an engaging visual display of OneSat’s support for the mission users and extensive performance data showing how OneSat will meet the mission need for each user. With OneSize, Airbus customers are able to quickly iterate with different mission scenarios to see how OneSat will perform.

“We are excited to partner with Kythera Space Solutions, leveraging their singular expertise in SDS optimization, to provide our customers with a unique capability in the industry,” said Olivier Mathieu, OneSat Programme Director of Airbus Defence and Space. “OneSize demonstrates the power of OneSat to meet highly varied mission needs and we consider it a vital part of Airbus’ comprehensive OneSat customer experience.”

Airbus plans to formally release OneSize initial versions gradually before the end of summer 2023.

Boeing and Airbus hunting for highly-skilled talent in India - The Times of India,"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9pbmRpYS1idXNpbmVzcy9ib2VpbmctYW5kLWFpcmJ1cy1odW50aW5nLWZvci1oaWdobHktc2tpbGxlZC10YWxlbnQtaW4taW5kaWEvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTg3Mjk0NDIuY21z0gGVAWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2luZGlhLWJ1c2luZXNzL2JvZWluZy1hbmQtYWlyYnVzLWh1bnRpbmctZm9yLWhpZ2hseS1za2lsbGVkLXRhbGVudC1pbi1pbmRpYS9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTg3Mjk0NDIuY21z?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing and Airbus are increasingly looking to India for highly-skilled, low-cost engineers to meet a boom in demand for aircraft and expand their manufacturing presence in the world’s fifth-largest economy. Airbus plans to hire 1,000 people in India this year out of 13,000 globally. Boeing and its suppliers , which already employ about 18,000 workers in the nation, have been growing by some 1,500 staff every year, the US jet manufacturer’s India head Salil Gupte told Bloomberg News in an interview.With about 1.5 million engineering students graduating annually, India is a rich source of talent for planemakers facing record orders from airlines as travel surges again after the Covid pandemic. Boeing can hire an engineer in Bengaluru, India’s southern tech hub, for 7% of the cost of a similar role in Seattle, according to salary data compiler Glassdoor.The country has Boeing’s second-biggest workforce worldwide, Gupte said.“Companies come to India for the incredible talent in innovation, not just in technology and software, but also in hard engineering and increasingly in manufacturing,” he said at the Aero India show in Bengaluru last month.Alongside the hiring push, Boeing and Airbus are also establishing some production in India, which is pitching itself as a less politically fraught alternative to China.Boeing signed a partnership with GMR Aero Technic Ltd. on March 10 to convert passenger jets to freighters in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, where it already has a facility making vertical fins, which stabilize planes. The plant, employing over 900 engineers and technicians, also produces Boeing AH-64 Apache helicopter structures, including fuselages for customers worldwide.Airbus has also been touting India’s manufacturing prospects as it hires in the country. In October, Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended a ceremony in his home state of Gujarat to mark the start of construction of a facility where Airbus Defence & Space SA and a unit of local conglomerate Tata Group will make C-295 transport aircraft for the Indian military.The nation is an emerging market for sales, with the revitalized Air India making a blockbuster order for 470 aircraft last month, split between the planemakers.“The time is right for India to turn into an international hub,” Airbus Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury said at the time of the aircraft order. “India is well on its way.”A vast pool of educated, English-speaking talent adds to India’s appeal as a hiring ground.Airbus employs more than 700 people at an engineering center in Bengaluru, and over 150 others in customer services there as well as in the capital New Delhi. India has a “unique ability” to support the company with its skilled manpower, an Airbus representative told Bloomberg, adding that hiring in the country was “not really” coming at the cost of jobs in other locations.A Boeing representative said the planemaker leverages India’s talent for engineering, technology and research and development. The company has said it plans to hire 10,000 people globally this year after adding nearly 15,000 in 2022, with a focus on engineering and manufacturing.Still, the Seattle Times reported last month that Boeing will cut about 2,000 jobs, mainly in finance and human resources, but without specifying where. Some of those jobs are being outsourced to Tata’s consulting arm in India.Gupte defended Boeing’s focus on India hiring, saying a bigger workforce there will help increase jobs in the US. Expanding manufacturing and innovation capabilities in the country will attract more customers and drive up demand for Boeing’s products, spurring employment, he said.Boeing tests some of its latest manufacturing technologies in India before rolling them out in US factories, which helps improve production efficiency, according to Gupte, who is based in Delhi.Boeing said in February it is investing 2 billion rupees ($24 million) in a logistics park in India that will initially cater to local airlines and then a larger network of customers in the region. The planemaker will also set up a support center with dozens of employees for airlines near Delhi.Companies have for decades looked to India to outsource jobs, from trade settlement to travel bookings. The country is home to about 40% of so-called global capability centers that provide tech, engineering and IT support, according to HSBC Holdings Plc. More recently, there’s been a shift to higher-skilled work for multinationals, including research and business development.The availability of workers in India at “competitive global costs makes offshoring of certain production processes a very real possibility,” said Ravi Srivastava , director of the Center For Employment Studies at the Institute of Human Development in Delhi.India is full of promising talent that can contribute to different sectors, but some additional training and skills are needed for certain niche manufacturing, said Sachin Alug, CEO at NLB Services near Delhi. Despite concerns about a recession, the hiring trend “is expected to continue for industries like aviation, which are picking new momentum in the country,” he said.Israel Aerospace Industries, which has worked with partners in India for three decades on air and missile defense systems, drones, satellites and other equipment, is among companies in the sector joining the hiring spree.“I’m amazed by the talent you find here in India. We are hiring new talent all the time,” Danny Lauber, chief executive officer of Israel Aerospace’s India unit, said in an interview. “I have worked in many places around the world, but I haven’t seen such a strong universe of resources.”"
"Air France welcomes “Grasse”, its 20th Airbus A220-300 - Air France - Corporate","Thu, 30 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vY29ycG9yYXRlLmFpcmZyYW5jZS5jb20vZW4vbmV3cy9haXItZnJhbmNlLXdlbGNvbWVzLWdyYXNzZS1pdHMtMjB0aC1haXJidXMtYTIyMC0zMDDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air France is continuing to renew its fleet by inte new generation aircraft, which are more economical and environmentally friendly.

By 2030, these aircraft will account for 70% of the Air France fleet - compared with 7% at present - thanks to an ambitious investment plan of one billion euros per year.

The airline reached a symbolic milestone today by welcoming its 20th Airbus A220-300, the latest flagship of its medium-haul fleet.

The aircraft, registration F-HZUU, rolled off the Airbus assembly line in Mirabel, Quebec, and is on its way to Paris-Charles de Gaulle, where it will operate on the airline's short- and medium-haul network.

It will make its first commercial flight on 1 April to Geneva (Switzerland).

The aircraft's front fuselage bears the name ""Grasse"", paying tribute to the pretty town in the Alpes-Maritimes region, famous all over the world for its perfume industry.

Since 2019, Air France has revived its tradition of naming its aircraft after French cities. This tradition celebrates the rich cultural and historical heritage of France’s regions, and promotes their reputation throughout the world.

Before Grasse, Air France named its previous Airbus A220s after Le Bourget, Collioure, Belle-Ile en Mer, Senlis and Arcachon.

By the end of 2025, 60 A220-300s will join the Air France medium-haul fleet. With up to 15 deliveries expected each year, this is the fastest fleet entry in the history of Air France.



Unparalleled economic and environmental performance

The most innovative and efficient single-aisle aircraft in its class, the Airbus A220-300 is perfectly suited to Air France's short and medium-haul network. It provides a cost reduction per seat of up to 10% compared to the Airbus A318 and A319 and stands out for its energy efficiency, consuming 20% less fuel than the aircraft it replaces and its CO2 emissions are also reduced by 20%. Its noise footprint is also 34% lower.

Fleet renewal is one of the major levers of Air France's decarbonisation trajectory, known as Air France ACT. Air France aims to reduce its CO2 emissions per passenger-kilometre by 30% by 2030, compared with 2019, excluding any offsetting measures. To reach these targets, Air France is doing all it can in terms of fleet renewal, the use of sustainable aviation fuel, eco-piloting and intermodality.



The highest level of in-flight comfort

The Air France Airbus A220-300 has 148 seats, in a 2-3 seat configuration (5 seats across) offering 80% of customers a window or aisle seat. The seat is the widest on the market for a single-aisle aircraft. It reclines and has an adjustable headrest, leather upholstery and an ergonomic seat cushion for enhanced comfort. A wide solid tray table, cup holder, a seat pocket, individual USB A and C ports and tablet or smartphone holder integrated into the backrest complete the package.

The cabin, the most spacious and brightest in its category, is decorated in the Air France signature colours – shades of blue, a strong presence of white providing light and contrast, and a hint of red symbolize the airline’s excellence and know-how. The central aisle is particularly wide, allowing customers to move about at ease. The carpet revisits the traditional ornamental herringbone pattern, symbolizing the emblematic Haussmann-inspired world of Parisian apartments. Large panoramic windows provide natural light for the duration of the trip. Finally, the spacious baggage racks are easy to access."
Airbus delivers and sells more aircraft than Boeing in February 2023 - AeroTime,"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvYWlyYnVzLWRlbGl2ZXJzLWFuZC1zZWxscy1tb3JlLWFpcmNyYWZ0LXRoYW4tYm9laW5nLWluLWZlYnJ1YXJ5LTIwMjPSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZXJvdGltZS5hZXJvL2FydGljbGVzL2FpcmJ1cy1kZWxpdmVycy1hbmQtc2VsbHMtbW9yZS1haXJjcmFmdC10aGFuLWJvZWluZy1pbi1mZWJydWFyeS0yMDIzL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus delivered more aircraft compared to Boeing throughout February 2023. However, the United States (US)-based Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) finalized and booked more orders than its European counterpart.

Special Airbus A350 delivery

In total, Airbus delivered 46 aircraft, mainly narrow-body jets (42 units), split between the A220-300 (three deliveries) and 39 A320neo family jets (13 A320neo, 26 A321neos). The European OEM handed over four wide-body aircraft, three commercial (1 A330-900neo to Condor Airlines, one A350 to Turkish Airlines, and one A350 to China Eastern Airlines), and one A330 MRTT to the NATO multinational tanker fleet.

The Turkish Airlines Airbus A350-900 became the carrier’s 400th aircraft. Called the “One Heart”, the aircraft, registered as TC-LGH, made its first flight with children affected by the two earthquakes that shook Turkey and Syria in early February 2023.

In terms of sales, the European manufacturer’s backlog grew by 99 aircraft, with one private customer ordering an A319neo, an undisclosed airline buying 15 A320neos, and British Airways opting for seven A320neo and three A321neo.

The bulk of the orders were from Qatar Airways, as Airbus added 50 A321neo and 23 A350-1000 aircraft to its order book. These orders had been temporarily taken off the order book during the dispute with the Qatari carrier regarding the A350’s paint surface. Once the two parties reached an agreement on February 1, 2023, Airbus reinstated the orders.

A month prior, the Toulouse, France-based company had booked 36 orders and delivered 20 aircraft.

Boeing’s delivery stoppages

Throughout February 2023, Boeing handed over 28 aircraft to customers, the majority of them being the 737 MAX (24 in total). The remaining four were the P8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, based on the 737-800, a 777F, a 747F, and a 787-10.

The US OEM’s deliveries have been affected by various shortfalls, including a delivery halt for the Boeing 787 due to a supplier’s analysis error related to the aircraft’s pressurization bulkhead at the front of the Dreamliner. The 787-10, which was delivered to United Airlines in February 2023, was approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) prior to the delivery stoppage. The FAA once again allowed the plane maker to hand over 787s to customers in March 2023.

In January 2023, Boeing notified operators of the 767F and the KC-46A Pegasus, based on the 767, of an issue with a paint primer used in the center wing fuel tank. As a result, no aircraft of either type have been delivered so far in 2023, including in March 2023, when this article was published.

Meanwhile, the 747-8F that was delivered to Atlas Air, to be operated for Apex Logistics, a subsidiary of Kuehne+Nagel, was the last-ever 747 to be built.

Boeing only booked a single order from an undisclosed customer for five 737 MAXs in February 2023. Still, during the month, the US OEM finalized a deal with Air India for 290 aircraft, namely 190 737 MAX, 20 787-9, and 10 777X-9 aircraft. At the same time, Airbus also won an order from Air India for 250 jets in February 2023. The order comprised of 210 A320neo family and 40 A350 aircraft and it was not noted in the OEM’s Orders and Deliveries data.

In January 2023, the American plane maker delivered 38 aircraft and booked 55 orders."
Airbus Enhances Skywise MRO Capabilities - Aviation Week,"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9tcm8vZW1lcmdpbmctdGVjaG5vbG9naWVzL2FpcmJ1cy1lbmhhbmNlcy1za3l3aXNlLW1yby1jYXBhYmlsaXRpZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus recently announced further enhancement of its Skywise digital platform at its recent Skywise Symposium in Istanbul. The platform will now offer additional tools and features that enable airlines, MROs, part traders and other users to easily perform more advanced actions, add applications, simulate scenarios and push data in real time to their own MRO IT systems.

This is just the most recent development in Skywise, a platform incorporating both data and applications to support predictive maintenance, along with many other functions. It is what Airbus calls an “ecosystem,” aimed at accelerating and expanding the exploitation of aviation data.

Skywise started five years ago as an internal tool to help Airbus ramp up production of its A350s by quickly collecting all relevant data. “We accelerated by 33% the overall delivery time of our A350 aircraft with the help of Skywise, mainly by reduction of lead time to resolve non-quality issues,” explains David Marty, head of digital solutions sales and marketing at Airbus Services.

Now, Skywise lets external users combine data from Airbus with their own data sources. Industry usage of Skywise has also expanded dramatically. Operators of about 10,000 aircraft, including both Airbus types and aircraft made by other OEMs, now use Skywise. More than 5,700 Airbus aircraft—nearly half its fleet—are now connected to the platform.

Most Skywise customers use the platform for their own purposes, such as increasing efficiency in flight operations, maintenance, inventory management, ground handling and so forth. For example, SKY Airlines saved significant maintenance costs by optimizing the allocation of aircraft by its Operational Control Center.

In addition, Airbus offers Skywise Predictive Maintenance +, which taps the connectivity of Airbus aircraft. The OEM’s Flight Operations and Maintenance Exchanger (FOMAX) comes with all new A320neo-family aircraft and can be retrofitted on A320ceos, giving the widely-flown narrowbodies the connectivity of A350s.

EasyJet reported that Skywise predictive tools helped it avoid 35 technical cancellations in August 2022. Airbus says Delta Air Lines mitigated more than 2,000 operational interruptions in its first year of Skywise use.

Asked how many airlines are now using Skywise Predictive Maintenance, Marty only says, “As of today we have a worldwide presence with customers in each region of the world.”

To facilitate data exchanges, Skywise can integrate data from a variety of systems, such as AMOS, Azure, SAP, Snowflake, Amazon Web Services, DataRobot, Hive, Databricks, Scale, TRAX, Ramco, Rusada software, Swiss-AS software, IBS Software, NetLine Suite, Conduce, Navblue, Sabre and Jeppesen. “Those are just examples of the various systems for which we have already performed successful connections in the past,” Marty says.

As a digital platform that hosts data and applications for a wide variety of aviation users and uses, including predictive maintenance, one could potentially compare Skywise to Lufthansa Technik’s Aviatar platform. However, Marty insists the two products differ significantly.

“The main difference is that Skywise is an open platform where customers can develop their own workflows and applications using on-the-shelf analytics capabilities, recently increased with machine learning and digital twins, while Aviatar customers can only access digital solutions developed by Lufthansa Technik,” says Marty.

“Aviatar is the only open platform focusing on tech-ops with open APIs to various airline and MRO IT ecosystems, including their flight and ground ops solutions,” responds Frank Martens, Lufthansa Technik’s senior director of sales for Aviatar and digital products. He adds that all of Aviatar’s predictive analytics are co-created with airlines. “All co-developed solutions are available off-the-shelf to other customers, if the required IP- and co-creation agreements are in place.”"

Airbus Ends Talks On Atos Evidian Acquisition - CRN,"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNybi5jb20vbmV3cy9tYW5hZ2VkLXNlcnZpY2VzL2FpcmJ1cy1lbmRzLXRhbGstb24tYXRvcy1ldmlkaWFuLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Ends Talks On Atos Evidian Acquisition

‘However, Airbus and Atos continue to discuss other potential options and pursue the work on the long term strategic and technological partnership between Airbus and Evidian which has the potential to create significant value for both companies,’ says Airbus in a press statement.

Airline manufacturer Airbus Wednesday said it is no longer pursuing discussions with global solution provider Atos over acquiring a 29.9-percent stake in Atos’ Evidian cybersecurity business.

Atos, in response, confirmed the move by Airbus.

That does not mean that Airbus is no longer interested in acquiring part of Atos’ Evidian business. Both companies, in press releases released Wednesday, only stated that that Airbus is not pursuing the acquisition of a 29.9-percent stake in Evidian.

Atos in February confirmed rumors that Airbus was looking to acquire a 29.9-percent stake in Evidian. For Airbus, which in addition to being one of the world’s largest aircraft manufacturers is also a major cybersecurity technology provider, that acquisition would have added substantially to its capabilities.

Atos’ North American business is ranked as the world’s 28th largest solution provider on CRN’s 2022 Solution Provider 500.

Evidian was formed out of Atos’ decision in early 2022 to divide itself into two separate companies. Atos would maintain the company’s focus on managed infrastructure services, digital workplace, and professional services. Evidian would focus on digital transformation, big data, and cybersecurity.

Airbus, in its release, wrote that the company has concluded that the acquisition does not meet its objectives in the current context and under their current structure.

“However, Airbus and Atos continue to discuss other potential options and pursue the work on the long term strategic and technological partnership between Airbus and Evidian which has the potential to create significant value for both companies,” Airbus wrote.

Atos, for its part, posted a similar statement that read in part, “Atos confirms it will, with Airbus, explore other options and pursue the work on the long term strategic and technological partnership between Airbus and Evidian which has the potential to create significant value for both companies, with a view of submitting these for consideration to its board of directors.”

Rumors of Airbus’ possible interest in acquiring part of Atos’ Evidian business were reported as early as January 1. At that time, both Atos and Airbus declined to discuss what they said were rumors.

Spokespeople from Atos and Airbus, both of which are based in France, did not respond to a CRN request for more information by press time.

While discussions between Atos and Airbus over the fate of part of Evidian seem likely continue, Evidian has other suitors.

Paris-based Thales and its adviser, Centerview Partners, in February of 2022 reportedly approached several investment firms including Bain Capital to discuss a deal that would have the private equity firms picking up the parts of Atos that Thales isn’t interested in owning.

Airbus and Thales are major competitors in the European cybersecurity business.

Atos in September also received an unsolicited letter of intent from Paris-based digital transformation services provider Group Onepoint in association with the British private equity fund ICG related to a potential acquisition of Evidian for an enterprise value of 4.2 billion Euros, or about $4.0 billion. At the time, Atos in a statement said, “The Board of Directors has convened and unanimously concluded that it is not in the interest of the Company and its stakeholders.”"

Jet planes and sugar cane: Qantas and Airbus get on board biofuel factory in Queensland - The Guardian,"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMy9tYXIvMzAvc3VnYXItY2FuZS1hdmlhdGlvbi1mdWVsLXFhbnRhcy1haXJidXMtamV0LXBsYW5lcy1iaW9mdWVsLWZhY3RvcnktcXVlZW5zbGFuZC1hdXN0cmFsaWHSAYcBaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjMvbWFyLzMwL3N1Z2FyLWNhbmUtYXZpYXRpb24tZnVlbC1xYW50YXMtYWlyYnVzLWpldC1wbGFuZXMtYmlvZnVlbC1mYWN0b3J5LXF1ZWVuc2xhbmQtYXVzdHJhbGlh?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qantas is banking on converting byproducts from north Queensland sugar cane into sustainable aviation fuel, as the air industry comes under increasing pressure to minimise its emissions.

On Thursday, Qantas announced that it and plane manufacturer Airbus will jointly invest $2m in a biofuel production facility that it hopes can produce up to 100m litres of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) a year when it opens in 2026. The Queensland government has also pledged $760,000 as part of an initial capital raising of $6m for the project.

The biofuel production facility is being developed by Jet Zero Australia in partnership with LanzaJet, a US company that has already produced SAF from carbon monoxide waste from a steel plant in China. This has been used in a blended form on commercial flights from the US.

LanzaJet’s process involves turning waste products into ethanol, which it then converts into the compound used for SAF.

Commercial aircraft are already using SAF – Airbus says all of its aircraft are capable of flying with an SAF blend of up to 50%. But experts believe ramping up production to the levels the aviation industry relies on is decades away, if possible at all.

Aviation accounts for slightly more than 2% of global CO2 emissions.

Qantas already uses a modest amount of SAF – 10m litres in 2023 – which it buys from overseas. It has committed to use 10% SAF in its overall fuel mix by 2030. The airline is expected to have to rely on offsets to achieve its commitment of net zero emissions by 2050.

In Australia, Jet Zero is focusing on agricultural byproducts from the sugar cane industry in north Queensland, with plans to build its facility in the region and rely on nearby port access.

Initially Jet Zero Australia will also use wheat starch byproducts from New South Wales, however sugar cane has the greatest potential, according to managing director Ed Mason.

Mason says that while SAF sources being developed in other countries rely on converting cooking oils, palm oil and animal fats, Jet Zero Australia would focus on agricultural byproducts.

“In my opinion [oils and fats are] just not as clean, and you’re not able to look through the lifecycle benefits as easily,” he said. “And from a social perspective people are much happier flying on biomass than on animal fat.”

Mason acknowledges that sustainable aviation fuel production is still in its infancy.

“We are pioneering this … we are taking risks with technology that’s unproven, but we’ve partnered with the most advanced technology already being used,” he said.

“We’re not dependent on new sources coming to market, and we’ve got commitments from the airline that they’re going to buy the fuel.”

Mason said Jet Zero Australia was “aggressively moving through feasibility studies” and, pending final investment, hopes to begin construction on the plant next year, with a view to it being operational by 2026. It would be Australia’s first sustainable aviation fuels plant.

Jimmy Samartzis, LanzaJet’s chief executive, said that tests the company had done with agricultural byproducts in Canada saw a “significant reduction” in contrails, or vapour trails, which form when water vapour and soot particles form into ice crystals.

Research has suggested contrails have an even greater impact on global heating than carbon emissions from jet engines.

“This is a first but significant step towards turning agricultural and sugar cane byproducts into aviation fuel to power flights around Australia,” said Andrew Parker, Qantas’s chief sustainability officer.

Susanne Becken, a professor of sustainable tourism at Griffith University, said it was promising to see the investment in SAF, but noted it was not the only way to decarbonise aviation.

Green hydrogen and electrification technology are also being explored by the industry, though are also in early development.

Becken said that while using sugar cane byproduct was still an improvement, it was “not a silver bullet” because of the emissions resulting from growing the feedstock.

While noting the Jet Zero Australia project only relied on byproducts, Becken said it was important that feedstocks for the biofuels didn’t take away land from food production.

Becken said the world will never be able to produce enough SAF to meet aviation’s current fuel demand because the competition over land and resources is too big.

She said ultimately the world’s reliance on aviation would have to shrink to levels which alternate forms of energy could supply, whether they be SAF or electricity.

In January, Queensland researchers said they had made a breakthrough that allows them to quickly convert sugar cane into a renewable chemical that could be used for sustainable aviation fuel."
HERON project to increase fuel efficiency in aviation takes flight - Airbus,"Tue, 07 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTAzLWhlcm9uLXByb2plY3QtdG8taW5jcmVhc2UtZnVlbC1lZmZpY2llbmN5LWluLWF2aWF0aW9uLXRha2VzLWZsaWdodNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In nature, the heron is a graceful bird that is highly adaptable to changing environmental conditions. In aviation, HERON is the designation of a new Airbus-led European project for fuel-efficient flight operations and a major step towards the decarbonisation of commercial aviation.

HERON is the acronym for “Highly Efficient gReen OperatioNs,” and the project’s goal is to demonstrate how aviation’s environmental footprint can be further reduced with innovative procedures that range from more efficient aircraft operations to optimised management of air traffic during flights. This programme is part of the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) Programme Joint Undertaking, which coordinates and concentrates all European Union research and development activities in air traffic management.

Joining Airbus in the three-year HERON programme are 25 partners across 10 countries, representing the full aviation ecosystem including airlines, airports, air traffic control agencies and service providers.

From ALBATROSS to HERON: Europe at the forefront of innovation

HERON is an expanded follow-on to the two-year SESAR programme known as ALBATROSS, which performed a series of gate-to-gate live trials across Europe for fuel-efficient flights. ALBATROSS brought together innovations such as optimised flight operations from climb-out to the descent for landing, followed by hybrid assistance for aircraft movements on the ground.

Airbus' hybrid taxiing solution to reduce aircraft fuel consumption show more show less The Airbus-led SESAR_JU project called HERON is a major step forward in the decarbonisation of commercial aviation. It applies innovative procedures such as more efficient aircraft movements at airports and optimised air traffic management to reduce fuel consumption.

With HERON, the goal is to pursue the deployment of already-mature solutions as steps that contribute toward achieving the air transport industry’s objective of ""net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,"" as set by IATA, ATAG and ICAO.

One focus of HERON is the management of fuel-efficient on-ground aircraft operations. This will include aircraft taxiing without use of engines for momentum and the optimisation of airplane movements at airports by avoiding unnecessary waiting times on taxiways and at parking stands. It will include the Green Apron Management demonstration, which uses sensors and artificial intelligence for more predictable and efficient aircraft handling during airport stopovers.

For airborne operations, one of the HERON work packages will improve air traffic control management of in-flight trajectories through enhanced network coordination. Another work package will see the implementation of smoother, more continuous descent profiles as aircraft near their destinations, which will involve flights into airports in Brussels, Istanbul, Warsaw, Calvi and Saint-Nazaire.

Airbus’ lead role in the HERON programme underscores the company’s broad commitment to applying innovation and using its resources to further reduce the impact of aviation on the environment.

The even larger-scale collaboration of HERON should accelerate the adoption of more energy-efficient flights across Europe.

Comparing the Airbus A350-900 and Boeing 787-9 | - AirInsight,"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vYWlyaW5zaWdodC5jb20vY29tcGFyaW5nLXRoZS1haXJidXMtYTM1MC05MDAtYW5kLWJvZWluZy03ODctOS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Care to share?

The Airbus A350-900 and Boeing 787-9 are the best-selling wide-body variants in the market today. These aircraft are remarkably similar in many respects. Each utilizes a high percentage of lightweight carbon fiber materials in its structure, with 53% of the A350 and 50% of the 787 by weight composed of that material. Both are long-range twins with modern fuel-efficient engines. Both enable comfortable premium cabins and a variety of interior layouts that can be tailored to airline needs. The following table illustrates just how close these aircraft are.





The A350-900 has a 665 nautical mile advantage in range, while the 787-9 has a lighter maximum take-off weight by 62,408 pounds. The A350-900 offers more seating in a typical configuration, which we would expect to result in a lower seat-mile cost. The 787-9, being a lighter aircraft, would be expected to have a lower cost per aircraft mile. To find out if those assumptions are true, we examined 2022 data from Skailark’s database of aircraft costs for both North American (including Canada, the US, and Mexico) and European carriers to provide a representative sample for each aircraft type.



The following chart from Skailark illustrates the total operating costs per seat for the Airbus A350-900 and Boeing 787-9, by carrier, including capital cost for the aircraft. The cost categories shown on the chart below include overheads, onboard costs, sales and distribution costs, ATC costs, airport passenger costs, airport landing fees, handling costs, cabin crew, flight crew, MRO, ownership financing, ownership costs and fuel costs, all from the top down, respectively.

After analyzing cost data, it is clear the Airbus A350-900 and Boeing 787-9 are also close in economic performance. The A350 has an average total cost per seat mile of $0.1210, and a cost per block hour of $18,370 across seven different operators, as shown in the table below.





The 787-9 has an average total cost per seat mile of $0.1250. This places the total cost per seat mile for the 787-9 at 3.3% higher than the A350. On an aircraft mile basis, the 787-9 averaged a block hour cost of $16,899, or 8% lower than the A350-900.





The Bottom Line:



The Airbus A350-900 and Boeing 787-9 are very similar aircraft, suited for similar missions. As one would expect, the slightly larger A350-900 has a seat-mile cost advantage, while the 787-9 has an advantage in cost per block hour. These aircraft are competitive, and nearly tie in economic performance. Each aircraft has been selling well since the A350-900 joined the 787-9 in the marketplace, and the future for both looks bright."
Airbus Helicopters sees growing demand for H160s in North America - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 07 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1cy1oZWxpY29wdGVycy1zZWVzLWdyb3dpbmctZGVtYW5kLWZvci1oMTYwcy1pbi1ub3J0aC1hbWVyaWNhL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters continues to experience a growing demand for H160 helicopters, with more than a dozen H160s already ordered by North American customers to date to fulfill a range of missions. Featuring the latest technology and a breakthrough design, the ACH160 recently made an impression on customers in the private and business aviation market, with four ACH160s ordered for this purpose in 2022.



To support this growth and the aircraft’s entry to service, plans are now in place for the addition of the first H160 full flight simulator (FFS) in North America. The FFS will be a critical training tool for the increasing number of customers in North and Latin America which have already placed orders for the versatile aircraft.

Three 'sleeping beauties' await their turn in orbit - Airbus,"Thu, 09 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLTAzLXRocmVlLXNsZWVwaW5nLWJlYXV0aWVzLWF3YWl0LXRoZWlyLXR1cm4taW4tb3JiaXTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Copernicus Sentinel climate satellites 2C, 2D and 6B have been finalised and are being safely stored in special tents awaiting their turn in orbit. These tents meet very strict storage requirements, specifically long term accumulation of humidity and will ensure the satellites are kept clean until each is required to travel to its launch site.

The Sentinel satellites power Europe’s Copernicus programme, the world’s largest single programme for observing and monitoring the Earth. The first Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite was launched in 2015 and the second in 2017, supplying images for a myriad of applications from food security to monitoring the shrinking ice caps, with the next pair (2C and 2D) set to follow when required.

Albert Zaglauer, head of Earth Observation Systems, says: “The work of Europe's Copernicus programme is vital. It monitors our planet’s health for the cost of just one cup of coffee per citizen per year.”

Sentinel-2C, is currently set for launch in 2024. The exact launch date will be decided by ESA and the European Union depending on several variables, one being the end of life of Sentinel-2A. Sentinel-2D is fully integrated and functionally tested. The next step will be the environmental test campaign, which will begin when more information is available about the launch date for Sentinel-2C and the end of life of Sentinel-2B.

The data gathered by Sentinel-2 satellites are used for monitoring land use and changes, soil sealing, land management, agriculture, forestry, natural disasters (floods, forest fires, landslides and erosion) and to assist humanitarian aid missions. Environmental observation in coastal areas likewise forms part of these activities, as does glacier, ice and snow monitoring. The telescope structure and the mirrors are made of silicon carbide, first pioneered by Airbus to provide very high optical stability and minimise thermo-elastic deformation, resulting in an excellent geometric image quality. This is unprecedented in this category of optical imagers.

Sentinel-6B, will continue the vital work of Sentinel-6A, launched in 2020 to monitor our oceans. The satellite, which includes European and US instruments, successfully completed its environmental test campaign last year. There is a second round of environmental tests foreseen before launch. ESA/NASA plan to launch Sentinel-6B in late 2025 and then to initiate a one-year handover with the first Sentinel-6A “Michael Freilich” satellite which has been successfully operating in orbit since the end of 2020.

The Copernicus Sentinel-6 will carry out high-precision measurements of ocean surface topography. Sentinel-6 measures its distance to the ocean surface with an accuracy of a few centimetres and uses this data to map it, repeating the cycle every 10 days, with the mission lasting up to seven years. It documents changes in sea-surface height, records and analyses variations in sea levels and observes ocean currents. Global sea levels are currently rising by an average of 3.3 millimetres a year as a result of global warming; this could potentially have dramatic consequences for countries with densely populated coastal areas. Each satellite carries a radar altimeter, which works by measuring the time it takes for radar pulses to travel to the surface and back again to the satellite. Combined with precise satellite location data, altimetry measurements yield the height of the sea surface. The satellites’ instrument package also includes an advanced microwave radiometer that accounts for the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, which affects the speed of the altimeter’s radar pulses.

Until they are called into action, the spacecraft will remain in hibernation, protected against any external disturbance.

Airbus has played a crucial role in constructing the satellites and instruments for Copernicus since the start of the programme in 1998, contributing its environmental expertise to all six Sentinel satellite missions and the new Copernicus next generation satellites: CRISTAL, LSTM, and ROSE-L missions.

Sentinel satellites are part of Copernicus, Europe’s environmental monitoring programme, which is led by the European Commission (EC) in partnership with the European Space Agency (ESA). The Copernicus Sentinels supply remote sensing data of the Earth, delivering key operational services related to environment and security.

"First the Moon, now Jupiter! - Airbus","Tue, 07 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTAzLWZpcnN0LXRoZS1tb29uLW5vdy1qdXBpdGVy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Following humankind’s successful first steps back toward the Moon with last year’s Artemis mission – powered by the Airbus-built European Service Module – the company is now ready for a key role in another important new space venture: a flight to Jupiter that is set to start this spring.

What is JUICE and what is its mission?

JUICE (JUpiter ICy moons Explorer) is the first European spacecraft to go to Jupiter. Its primary goal is to understand whether the oceans of these icy Jovian moons could sustain life.

JUICE will spend over eight years travelling the 600 million kilometres to reach our solar system’s largest planet, where its instruments will focus on three of Jupiter’s biggest moons: Ganymede, Europa and Callisto.

To reveal more about this fascinating planet and its natural satellites, JUICE’s “eyes” and “ears” are composed of 10 state-of-the-art scientific instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, an ice-penetrating radar, a radio-science experiment and sensors.

Once in the vicinity of Jupiter, JUICE will spend four years gathering data – including nine months orbiting Ganymede, which will mark the first time a spacecraft orbits a moon other than our own. JUICE will analyse this icy Jovian moon’s nature and evolution, characterising its subsurface ocean, and investigating potential habitability.

JUICE will also focus on Jupiter itself, gathering data on the gas giant planet’s atmosphere, from its cloudy layers to the ionosphere and auroras. The spacecraft’s instruments will look at different wavelengths of light to provide new insights into how temperatures, wind patterns and chemistry are changing in this never-before-seen part of Jupiter’s atmosphere.

A European team for JUICE

Bringing together 80 partners across 23 countries and harnessing the brainpower of 2,000+ people, Airbus has designed and built JUICE under contract to the European Space Agency (ESA).

“It’s been a long Earthly journey through various sites towards final integration and flight readiness”, says Cyril Cavel, JUICE project manager. “It is truly an international accomplishment, involving more than 80 companies across Europe and close to 500 team members in Airbus alone.""

One of the key spacecraft features is its solar arrays, made byAirbus’ site in Leiden, the Netherlands. Covering a total surface area of 85 square metres, these are one of the largest solar arrays of its type ever built. This phenomenal size - a bit larger than a badminton court - is essential because Jupiter is so far from the sun that large arrays are needed to deliver the power necessary for the spacecraft and its instruments.

What has to happen before launch?

We are truly on the home straight now: JUICE was shipped from the Airbus production site in Toulouse, France to South America, where it is now undergoing final preparations by our engineers before launch on 13 April by an Ariane 5 rocket from French Guiana.

By going even deeper into space with JUICE, Airbus will contribute to the further understanding of our solar system, with this spacecraft’s data potentially answering questions on how planets are formed and where life may have emerged - stay tuned to follow this exciting journey!

When Technology Fails: An Airbus A319's Mid-Air Mystery - Fear of Landing,"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vZmVhcm9mbGFuZGluZy5jb20vYWNjaWRlbnRzL2FjY2lkZW50LXJlcG9ydHMvd2hlbi10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWZhaWxzLWFuLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzE5cy1taWQtYWlyLW15c3Rlcnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On the 6th of August 2021, an Airbus A319-131, registration G-DBCF, departed from Edinburgh for a scheduled passenger flight to London Heathrow. There were 101 passengers and five crew on board. The captain had over 16,000 flying hours, with 4,476 on type, and was the Pilot Flying.

As the aircraft picked up speed for departure on runway 06 at Edinburgh, there was a loud bang. The captain said that it felt like they had passed over a centreline light on the take-off roll. As they climbed away through 1,500 feet, the first officer saw an alert appear on his display unit: GPS PRIMARY LOST.

The message disappeared before the crew could take any action. Everything appeared to be working as expected.

But then, as they climbed through 1,500 feet, the first officer, in his role as Pilot Monitoring, saw a message on his Multipurpose Control and Display Unit (MCDU): GPS PRIMARY LOST

Again, he barely had time to read the message before it was gone. The Airbus A319 continued to climb normally. The crew could not see any obvious action that they should take.

As they reached Flight Level 340 (34,000 feet), another message flashed on the first officer’s MCDU: CHECK IRS 3/FM POSITION. The autopilot and auto thrust disconnected and both pilots lost their flight director displays. The Flight Mode Annunciator showed only CAT 3 DUAL INOP. Meanwhile, the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitoring (ECAM) displayed a collection of errors: AUTO FLT AP OFF, AUTO FLT A THR OFF and ENG THRUST LOCK.

The captain took control and levelled out the aircraft. The aircraft seemed to be flying fine, but they were flying under Reduced Vertical Separation Minima (RVSM), which requires the autopilot to be controlling the altitude. Now, they were no longer in compliance. The first officer immediately made a PAN-PAN call to ATC. This is effectively a step down from a MAYDAY call: a PAN-PAN call signals that there is an urgent situation which is not life-threatening.

It wasn’t clear what was going wrong. The ECAM errors were symptoms, not causes, and the ECAM did not offer any further messages. When they tried to re-engage the autopilot and the auto thrust, both simply disconnected again. There were no warning lights or other errors on the flight deck. The first officer even checked to see if a circuit breaker had tripped, but that wasn’t the case.

Finally, after about five minutes of trying, the autopilot and autothrust remained engaged, as if nothing had happened.

The crew attempted to diagnose the situation, discussing what they should do. On the MCDU, the display unit the crew used to interface with the Flight Management Computer, they saw that the Inertial Reference System positions weren’t right.

The Air Data Inertial Reference System is a combination of functions which provides flight data to the Flight Management computers, the flight controls, the engine controls, the flight deck display panels and any other system requiring inertial reference information and air data. The system uses information from three Air Data and Inertial Reference Units (ADIRU). In a nutshell, the inertial reference information consists of position and attitude, while the air data includes the airspeed, angle of attack and altitude.

The position information on the display didn’t make sense, with the displayed positions varying by over 30 nautical miles. Normally, the readings would be within a nautical mile of each other.

Knowing they couldn’t trust their position information, the flight crew asked air traffic control for radar vectors and continued to Heathrow. They discussed attempting to realign the Inertial Reference System in flight but decided against it. The aircraft monitor (ECAM) had not highlighted any known errors or instructed them to do so. As the aircraft was flying safely, it seemed better to leave it rather than risking further problems with an unknown fix.

That was the right choice. Airbus later said there is no procedure that ever advises the flight crew to realign the IRS in flight while in NAV mode. The result would have been that the autopilot and the autothrust would have been disabled and the aircraft would fall back into alternate or direct law, changing the flight mode to protect the aircraft from different types of failure. Airbus agreed with the crew’s conclusion that they had the situation under control and it was better to continue.

The crew asked for an extended final approach to allow them additional time to monitor the aircraft. They discussed the expected indications so as to better watch for further anomalous data or instrument failures.

All seemed normal until they descended through 4,000 feet for the instrument approach, flying to intercept the localiser. The autopilot and the autothrust disconnected and the flight director displays were lost. The crew discontinued the localiser approach and rebriefed for a manual approach. The Airbus A319 landed safely a few minutes later.

When the British Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) looked at the flight data from the Quick Access Recorder, they saw that something had happened as the Airbus was accelerating on the runway at Edinburgh. As the A319 reached 120 knots, the nose landing gear seemed to bounce, without any flight control inputs to explain it. They’d run over something.

After they took off, the Inertial Reference System started to drift until the autoflight rejected the data from one of the Air Data and Inertial Reference Units as they climbed away. There was no error or annunciation to the crew. As they reached cruising height, the autoflight system rejected the data from all three units, which is why the autopilot and autothrust disconnected in the first place. The Air Data and Inertial Reference Units continued to provide attitude and air data information.

Then, when they were on the approach, the autoflight system rejected data from more than one unit, which caused the autopilot and the autothrust to disconnect again.

The mystery of the disconnecting systems now made sense; however, it still didn’t explain why the Inertial Reference System had started to drift in the first place. But British Airways, the operator of the aircraft, had reported the same problem to Airbus before. In fact, they had five similar incidents on their A320 fleet. Based on these reports, and those from other airlines, Airbus concluded that in every instance, the aircraft had a specific type of Air Data and Inertial Reference Unit, a type which Airbus stopped fitting to aircraft in 2015. However, there were 1,459 A320s with these units installed, about 14% of the A320 fleet.

Airbus installed accelerometers on several aircraft to measure the vertical forces acting on the nose landing gear. They suspected that the problem wasn’t the units themselves, however, but the shock absorber. These confirmed that heavy shock to the landing gear on take off and landing was being transferred to the avionics rack, vibrating and jolting the three Air Data and Inertial Reference Units which were in the rack.

In 2010, Airbus revised the servicing tasks for a modified maintenance check of the nose-landing-gear shock absorber every twenty-four months, with additional checks in the case of an “abnormal vibration event”. This reduced the issues of severe IR drift, but it was still not entirely resolved. Airbus began developing new equipment for the nose landing gear shock absorber that they hoped would stop the drift once and for all.

In April 2020, a year before the incident, Airbus released a Technical Follow Up to warn that severe IR drift issues were possible, caused by a combination of issues, especially high vertical loads on the nose landing gear with incorrect servicing of the landing gear shock absorbers. This was focused on ensuring that maintenance teams understood the effects of shock absorber maintenance.

This incident fit right into the pattern and it turned out that yes, the shock absorber had lost effectiveness. For normal take-offs and landings, the shock absorber was correctly able to deal with the vertical forces encountered while taking off and landing.

But when the A319 took off from Edinburgh that day, the weight-on-wheels had toggled off and on again with a sharp vertical jolt. This was more than the normal uneven surface of the runway.

Using the logged data from the aircraft, they were able to estimate how far along the runway the A319 was when the vertical jolt happened. The airport authority then inspected the runway and discovered the issue. The airport authority referred to this as “a slightly uneven patch repair”. Local media referred to it as a pothole.

Presumably using a car, not an aircraft, airport personnel drove over the spot at high speed and the occupants felt a distinct jolt as they drove over the problem spot.

In early 2022, the airport authority reported that the patch had been replaced as a part of scheduled runway maintenance.

So, the mystery was solved. The nose wheel bounced over the pothole which jarred the nose wheel gear. The shock absorber had lost effectiveness and didn’t fully absorb the shock from the airframe and avionics racks. This jolted the Air Data and Inertial Reference Units, which were known to be sensitive to vertical forces, which resulted in severe drift.

Now, the flight crew did not know that there had been previous cases of drift caused by the lack of shock absorption in the nose landing gear; this was a maintenance problem. There was no published information for flight crew that explained that an unexpected jolt could, in certain aircraft, cause severe IR drift. If they were lucky, the problem would present itself clearly and the ECAM messages would point them to the correct checklist.

But in this case, no clear ECAM messages were generated to point to the IR drift. The closest they had was probably an ECAM message which stated: NAV FM/GPS POS DISAGREE. However, although this message appears with a single chime and master caution light, the message will disappear again when the level of disagreement reduces. So that message would correctly only have been displayed for a few seconds. Neither of the flight crew noticed it.

Airbus concluded that although this was not a great situation, in the end, everything worked out as they expected.

The aircraft manufacturer commented that, as demonstrated by this crew, IR drifts can be successful managed by the process it termed ‘fly, navigate, communicate’, and that no specific additional actions are required. The manufacturer considered publishing information to all flight crews about IR drift events, but was concerned that flight crews might then associate any gps primary lost message or AP and A/THR loss with a drift of the IRS. It therefore concluded that such communication would be detrimental.

In other words, releasing information about this specific and rare incident increases the load on flight crew training while not actually having much of an effect. Worse, it could lead crew to misdiagnose more common issues that showed the same symptoms. The crew needed to do exactly what they did: keep flying the aircraft. There was no additional action they could have taken that would have made things any better. The only benefit is that the crew may have spent less time trying to troubleshoot the situation.

You can read the full report in AAIB Bulletin 7/2022

British Airways published an article about the incident, and a previous similar incident, in the company safety magazine, so the details are out there for the curious pilot.

The flight crew, at least, will never forget the incident."

However, last year some carriers have surprisingly announced their plan to reactivate the aircraft after a rebound in international travel.

Several airlines have already brought back A380s, including Singapore Airlines and Australian flag carrier Qantas, which has so far returned six of its A380s to service. However, in one statement, the airline confirmed that the slot constraints with its MRO services are slowing down the process of the reactivation of the A380s. German carrier Lufthansa has also announced its plan to return some A380 aircraft to service this summer. Additionally, in December 2022, Etihad Airways also unveiled plans to reactivate its fleet of 10 A380 aircraft.

The data below illustrates the spike in aircraft returning from storage in 2023 and 2024. Beyond then, we will see an increase in the retirement of A380 aircraft. According to Aviation Week’s 2023 Fleet & MRO Forecast, nine A380s will return from storage in 2023 and next year a total 46 aircraft are expected to return from the storage.

According to Aviation Week data, over the next 10 years, the widebody aircraft will represent a value of $23.5 billion in MRO spending. It is forecast that 45% of A380 aftermarket demand will consist of engine maintenance. Modification and components account for 22% and 14%, respectively, while line maintenance and airframe heavy will see demand around $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively.

The largest A380 operator, Emirates, has begun cabin upgrades on its fleet of 67 aircraft. Thus, there will be a spike in modifications from 2023-25. The data below also shows the decline in A380 MRO demand in 2026.

According to the data, over the next decade, the A380 will see a total demand of 1,196 C checks and 1,188 engine overhaul shop visits. Meanwhile, there will be a demand of 146 D checks and 16 engine LLP events for the A380 over the next 10 years.

We aim at continuously and proactively improving the safety of operations of our products.

As a manufacturer, Airbus is expected to build safe aircraft and to participate in their safe operation through continued airworthiness and efficient customer support. Beyond this role, we want to contribute to the global enhancement of the way our aircraft are operated.

One example of how we do this is by promoting Upset Prevention and Recovery Training (UPRT). It aims to enhance safety by providing pilots with a solid theoretical background in tandem with practical training. Simulators help make this both possible and effective by recreating daily operations, but the role of experienced, competent instructors is even more central. Their training and standardisation is key to successfully implementing a UPRT programme.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) prescribes UPRT as a mandatory standard that each member country must implement. Such training comes in complement to the flight envelope protections available on the latest generation of aircraft, which prevent aircraft from going beyond their designated limits in terms of altitude, speed, load and other aerodynamic capabilities.

These trainings enhance the exchange of knowledge and experience, a dialogue essential to improving operational aviation safety at regional and international levels."

Legacy American Airlines Boeing 737s and Airbus A321s that had seat back entertainment had those screens removed. They added seats to planes, giving each passenger less room (even in first class). They even shrunk the lavatories.

There are two strange things about this fleet, though.

The ‘new domestic product’ was poorly planned. They didn’t even build a cabin mockup before they began installing seats. As a result they got a lot of the details wrong, bolting the first class seats to the floor without thinking – preventing passengers from having underseat storage space – and lacking the tablet holders in first class that were giving to coach passengers. They wound up having to retrofit planes that they’d just retrofit to fix the problems. Ultimately it was clear that the details of the product weren’t important enough to the airline to matter, even though it would be the primary product offered to its customers, because the airline’s CEO at the time didn’t even bother to try it for over six months after it was flying.

A decade into the merger, and over 5 years from rollout of their new product, they haven’t updated the entire fleet – and have no plans in place to do so. There are some positives in the new configuration like larger overhead bins. But Airbus A319s, which still have seat back entertainment screens if they were purchased by American Airlines before the merger, haven’t gotten these. And the legacy US Airways ‘Basket of Deplorables’ planes haven’t been touched, other than new seat covers.

The condition of the interiors of American Airlines A320s is sad. The American Airlines social media team tells customers that will change – but that isn’t true.

We're still working on updating all of our planes. In the meantime enjoy the retro vibes! — americanair (@AmericanAir) March 19, 2023

Whenever I’ve flagged photos like these, the response I’ve gotten has been ‘well passengers wouldn’t want us to delay their flights to fix these seats’ – but that begs the questions, (1) why is it always the A320s? (2) What are they doing – or not doing – when the planes aren’t flying to maintain the interiors so that this doesn’t happen so frequently?

American Airlines retired its Embraer E-195s, Boeing 757s and 767s, and Airbus A330s during the pandemic, and its MD80s right before that. But this fleet of around 48 planes continues to operate. Many of them date to the 90s, from America West Airlines and from US Airways prior to being taken over by America West. The newest one is 17 years old (only three are less than 20 years old).

Leaving aside the regional jets that remain parked, the carrier is not even fully utilizing the mainline aircraft that it has yet. To be sure there have been delays delivering new aircraft from both Boeing and Airbus. However there’s no announced plans to retire these Airbus A320s, or to update them. And they’ve been flying these planes for years having already updated their Boeing 737s and Airbus A321s, a process that continued throughout the pandemic using government cash."
