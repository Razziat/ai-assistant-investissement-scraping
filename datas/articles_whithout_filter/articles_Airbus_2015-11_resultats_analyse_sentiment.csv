Airbus Patents Detachable Cabins to Cut Plane Boarding Times - WIRED,"Wed, 25 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS8yMDE1LzExL2FpcmJ1cy1wYXRlbnRzLWRldGFjaGFibGUtY2FiaW5zLXRvLWN1dC1wbGFuZS1ib2FyZGluZy10aW1lcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"All right, everyone. It’s quiz time. What’s the worst part about flying? ""Everything,"" is an entirely appropriate response, but the one thing that's most miserable about flying is the waiting.

Waiting to get through security. Waiting for bad food and overpriced water. Waiting to get on the damn plane, waiting to get off the damn plane. You'd think the industry's approach to customer service is ""hurry up and wait,"" but airlines hate waiting as much as you do. Every moment a plane is a stationary is a moment it isn't making money. Boeing says cutting an airplane's ""turn-time""—its time on the ground—by 10 minutes improves utilization level 8.1 percent. That's a big deal in an industry that typically earns a profit of just $8.27 per passenger, and it's why flight attendants practically push you down the aisle. Airlines want you seated ASAP.

That's got Airbus reconsidering the boarding process with an idea to turn aircraft cabins into what amount to shipping containers. We'll pause here to let you groan.

You know Airbus. Aside from making the magnificently huge A380 and very popular A320, the company's also offered two of the most questionable seating ideas imaginable: The backless bike-seat half-stand model and what we call the steerage concept that essentially stacks passengers. The people in charge of R&D seem to spend a decent amount of time dreaming up ways to make flying even more hellish, but the latest idea—filed in February 2013 and approved by the United States Patent and Trademark Office just yesterday—shifts the focus from seats to the cabin itself.

To reduce a plane's turn-time, Airbus proposes “a removable cabin module, comprising a floor, an upper aircraft fuselage portion connected to the floor, and a first and a second end wall, wherein the first and second end walls, the floor and the upper aircraft fuselage portion form a cabin for transport of passengers, luggage, freight or combinations thereof.”

In other words, it’s a detachable cabin passengers board while its at the gate. Once everyone is seated, the pod is lowered onto the plane. When you arrive at your destination, the cabin is removed, another is added, and the plane takes off. The time it spends on the ground is drastically reduced.

It’s not the craziest idea. If everything in the cabin could be ready and waiting for the pilots when they arrive with the flatbed, as it were, then once the cabin container attached itself you’d be off and running in a jiffy. Airbus has called this the ""aircraft pod concept,"" saying ""passengers could be pre-seated in cabin pods before the plane actually arrives, ready for integration on the aircraft, saving time and making processing much simpler.""

But there are few industries so tightly regulated as the airline industry, and one imagines that the safety protocol of ensuring the pod doesn't pop off at 36,000 feet would negate at least some of the time saved by not waiting for that jerk with the oversized carry-on to finally check the damn thing.Then there’s the matter of airport infrastructure. Airbus’ patent includes drawings of the docking stations and transport equipment to shuttle the cabin containers about, but short of snapping our fingers and ending up in Tomorrowland, this kind of terminal overhaul feels highly unlikely. That, and the fact that designing a new plane from scratch takes about a decade and billions of dollars. Something this different from the status quo would almost certainly take more time and more money.

So, yeah. The “Method for boarding and unloading of passengers of an aircraft with reduced immobilization time of the aircraft, aircraft and air terminal for its implementation” won’t be coming to an airport near you any time soon, but at least the designers and engineers at Airbus are dreaming big. And if they get cracking on that VR-helmet idea they floated awhile ago, we might actually start looking forward to the waiting after all.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998224377632141}",neutral,0.9998224377632141,0

The Commercial Aircraft Company of China, or COMAC, rolled out its new C919 medium-range airliner. The twin-engined jet is China's answer to industry stalwarts, such as the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320.

The medium-range jet market is basically a duopoly split between Airbus and Boeing. However, the China aircraft maker is confident there's room for a third player in a global market that industry observers believe will have demand for 2,500 jets over the next 20 years.

But COMAC will also have to overcome the stigma of being a newcomer, from a country not yet noted for commerical airline manufacturing.

""Flyers want to fly on planes with a track record for safety, reliability and comfort,"" Deloitte vice chairman Tom Captain told Business Insider earlier this year. ""It takes decades to build that track record.""

However, Captain added that customers shouldn't immediately write off the Chinese company because its has established itself in the industry.

""In the 1970s, Airbus was also an unknown upstart,"" Captain said.

The Shanghai-based airplane maker introduced its new plane in a large ceremony at the company's production facility, located just north of the city.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8994922637939453}",positive,0.8994922637939453,1
Airbus patents modular cabins that turn planes into trucks - The Verge,"Thu, 26 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDE1LzExLzI2Lzk4MDM4NTgvYWlyYnVzLXBhdGVudC1tb2R1bGFyLWFpcnBsYW5lLWNhYmluc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Flying coach in commercial airliners is already a fairly miserable process, but it can seem like aircraft designers are bent on making the experience even worse. Manufacturer Airbus' latest patent, approved yesterday after it was applied for in 2013, proposes a modular cabin into which passengers can be seated before their plane even arrives. That cabin would then be attached to the plane after the previous module was removed, cutting down the time it takes to prepare planes for flight, and assisting in airlines' desperate bids to cram more humans into narrow metal tubes thousands of feet in the sky.

The patent filing describes a removable cabin module, ""comprising a floor, an upper aircraft fuselage portion connected to the floor, and a first and a second end wall, wherein the first and second end walls, the floor and the upper aircraft fuselage portion form a cabin."" The document says the cabins could be modified ""for transport of passengers, luggage, freight or combinations thereof."" As shown in the accompanying pictures, in Airbus' model, airplane fuselages become trucks, pulling up at airports to get their next container of people, before taking off again.

The patent might not ever make it into real airplanes

While being dropped onto a pair of wings like a Lego brick before being launched into the sky won't appease the minds of nervous flyers, Airbus' latest patent is at least more humane than the one it applied for in October, which saw passengers stacked on top of each other in a writhing mass of humanity in order to save space. Airbus isn't even the only company trying to test its evil science on airline passengers. Zodiac Seats France showed off a hellish seating arrangement earlier this year that supposedly maximized space in economy class by flipping the middle seats around, making passengers to face each other, and forcing them to stare into their seat neighbors' eyes while their hands are jammed against their butts.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999092817306519}",neutral,0.9999092817306519,0
"Airbus Targets Helo Refueling, Paratrooper Airdrops for A400M - Defense News","Mon, 02 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS90cmFpbmluZy1zaW0vMjAxNS8xMS8wMi9haXJidXMtdGFyZ2V0cy1oZWxvLXJlZnVlbGluZy1wYXJhdHJvb3Blci1haXJkcm9wcy1mb3ItYTQwMG0v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"



SEVILLE, Spain — Airbus is seeking ways to allow the A400M to refuel helicopters and airdrop paratroopers on both sides of the fuselage, two capabilities seen as key for the military transport, said Fernando Alonso, head of military aircraft.

The plane is a ""fantastic platform,"" but Airbus Defense & Space knows air forces of the client nations are ""very frustrated"" and eager to have the capabilities fitted, Alonso told journalists Oct. 26.

Air-to-air refueling is a vital function for special forces helicopters flying in the vast sub-Saharan Sahel region as that capability reduces contact with the harsh, gritty sand that is wearing down helicopter engines. That is one of the capabilities contracted but which is late to be fitted on the new transport.

Air-to-air refueling is a vital function for French special forces deployed in the vast sub-Saharan Sahel region, where landing in harsh grit swiftly wears down helicopter engines. That was just one of the capabilities contracted but which are late to be fitted on the new transport.

Refueling helicopters will be ""very difficult to achieve,"" but Airbus has not abandoned the capability, Alonso said. An option to be explored is to use a 120- to 150-foot hose, compared to the present 90-foot hose, to allow helicopters to fly a safe distance as they refuel.

A longer hose might cut aerodynamic risk but could boost the unpredictability as the drogue dangles behind four powerful turboprop engines. Building, testing and certifying a new hose will take time and money. Onera, the aerospace research office, could be asked to look for a solution, an industry executive said.

""The situation is not satisfactory,"" Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told the parliamentary defense committee Oct. 21 when asked about the A400M program. The capability gaps are airdrops, self defense systems and aerial refueling of helicopters, he said.

""Airbus has to fix these problems, but the steps taken have not delivered satisfactory results, as I understand it,"" he said.

France hopes to have 11 A400Ms by the end of 2016, of which six should be fitted with the capabilities for self defense, airdrops and landing on rough strips, Le Drian said. ""There are problems, and my relations with the company are on the lively side. That is my job.""

France has agreed to deliver helicopter refueling at a later stage, procurement chief Laurent Collet-Billon told the parliamentary defense committee Oct. 7. But Paris asked Airbus to ""make an effort"" in speeding up development, particularly the parachute capability, as the latest trials ""were not completely satisfactory"".

Other features that need attention are software for airdrops of heavy cargo loads and self-protection systems, he said. Those issues were included in talks over the summer between the seven client countries and Airbus.

An urgent need for helicopter refueling is reflected in the French plan to acquire four C-130s, of which two will be equipped for that mission.

France recently wrote to the US Air Force about the C-130, and the service understood the need, Collet-Billon told the committee.

The Direction Générale de l'Armement procurement office also is looking in Europe for second-hand C-130Hs, with two units for transport and two for helicopter refueling, and also for a company to convert a C-130 to refueling, he said.

The €330 million (US$361.2 million) set in the revised budget law is too small for the C-130J model, but the DGA could order a mix of H and J units and ask the minister to decide by the end of the year the delivery of which model should be postponed, he said.

Among the Airbus research projects being conducted is the fitting of the C-295 medium transport for in-flight refueling.

Another key capability is paratroopers jumping simultaneously from the side doors. The computer modeling shows a risk of the parachutes converging and colliding as they open, a critical moment in the airdrop.

One possible solution might involve using a specific kind of parachute, the executive said.

Free-fall jumping from one of the doors, from the ramp, and a static line automatic release from the ramp have been certified, said Kurt Rossner, head of the A400M program.

The UK has four units, dubbed Atlas, in service and received three more, which are undergoing tests. The British units will be fitted with a specific defensive aids subsystem similar to the directional infrared countermeasure installed on the Voyager A330 multirole tanker transport (MRTT) flown by the Royal Air Force. Britain gets that system as London has cleared the US International Traffic in Arms Regulations.

There are talks on a final review for deliveries and retrofit of capabilities, which are expected to close by mid-2016, with Airbus in talks with the Organization for Joint Armament Cooperation, the European procurement agency, and the client countries.

A full set of capabilities, including low-level flight, is due to be fitted in 2018 to achieve the full common standard capability.

Airbus plans to deliver between 13 and 17 units this year, with the last four due in December. A previous schedule set a minimum of 14 deliveries but a deadly crash on May 9 of an A400M due for Turkey reduced that number by one.

Next year, 23 units are due for delivery as production speeds up. That compares to seven or eight delivered last year.

France (7), Britain (4), Germany (1), Turkey (1) and Malaysia (1) have the plane in service, with Spain due to receive its first unit in the second quarter 2016, and one for Belgium and Luxemburg in the first half 2019.

Airbus group took a charge of €290 million in the first half of 2015 to cover development on the A400M, adding to the €551 million booked for 2014.

Airbus is in ""serious negotiations"" with potential export clients for the A400M, helped by the plane now being operational, said Antonio Rodriguez Barberan, head of sales for military aircraft. Sales of more than 300 units over the next 30 years are expected. Three South American countries have asked for extra information.

On the MRTT, there is ample room to fit sensors to gather intelligence, Alonso said. The potential applications will be part of a wide-ranging review intended to deliver by the end of next year a strategic road map for future military aircraft. That study will consider what future combat will look like, and assess the need for manned and unmanned aircraft, stealth, data cloud, space and systems such as the Zephyr, a high altitude pseudo satellite.

For some time there has been talk in France of arming the A400M with cruise missiles, effectively creating a low-cost, long-range bomber from a transport. Those conversions are underway for the light C-235 and medium C-295 planes. Jordan signed an agreement in June 2014 with Airbus and ATK to convert a C-295 into a gunship, similar to the two C-235 light gunships converted by ATK for the Arab nation.

One of the pressing concerns Airbus now confronts is the client's request for delivery ""tomorrow"" of military aircraft, cutting down time for development and calling for ""agility,"" Alonso said.

Tom Cruise showed that agility when he ran on the wing and climbed onto the fuselage as an A400M took off in the film ""Mission Impossible — Rogue Nation.""

The move was welcomed by chief executives of major Middle Eastern airlines at this year's Dubai Airshow, who said the move would bring some much needed competition to the industry. They said they would be happy to consider buying Chinese planes, as much of the technology is actually Western.

The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, known as COMAC, showed off its C919 plane in a huge ceremony in Shanghai last week. It can seat up to 168 passengers and is intended to compete with the single-aisle jets, such as the Airbus A320 and Boeing's 737, COMAC said it has received orders from 21 customers for a total of 517 aircraft, mostly from Chinese carriers but also from GE Capital Aviation Services, according to reports. Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said that he would have ""no hesitation at all in buying Chinese airplanes,"" as long as they were made to the standard that he wanted. ""There is nothing wrong with buying Chinese. You use an iPhone, which is made in China. Designed by somebody else, but made in China. I think it would be good for this (Boeing/Airbus) monopoly to be broken,"" Al Baker told CNBC, speaking at the Dubai Airshow.

Emirates President Tim Clark said you can ""never say never"" when it comes to China, as it has the ""human resource, the physical resource, and the wealth to do it."" But, he added that the barriers for entry into the airline business are very high. ""If the Chinese are going to do that then it's a big catch up that's got to take place. I'm not saying that will not happen. But it is a very, very complex business to get into,"" Clark told CNBC. Even Airbus Chief Fabrice Bregier acknowledged that outside players were piling pressure on the European group and U.S. rival Boeing, which is the biggest airline in the world in terms of deliveries. The likes of Brazilian firm Embraer has emerged as the world's number three plane manufacturer and COMAC has stepped up its operations.

Airbus: 'detachable cabins' will cut costs and waiting times - WIRED,"Fri, 27 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9haXJidXMtcGF0ZW50LWNhYmluLW1vZHVsZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Plane manufacturer Airbus has been granted a patent for passenger-filled 'shipping containers' that slot into a plane.

In a patent granted earlier this week, Airbus detailed a method that essentially turns a plane into a truck. Instead of featuring a single hull, as traditional planes do, the plane would have a hole in the middle. Passengers wouldn't board the plane itself, but instead would be loaded into a separate ""cabin module"" in the departure lounge. This module would then be dropped into the hole.

According to Airbus, the design would significantly ""reduce the immobilisation time of the aircraft and terminal"" -- so it's a time-saving method. Instead of waiting in a departure lounge for your plane to be disembarked and cleaned, and for luggage to be unloaded, passengers, and their luggage, would instead take their place in the loading cabin instantly.

Waiting is not only an irritating aspect of a travelling experience, but also costs airlines money -- in the US, airlines make a profit of just $8.27 per passenger. Airbus say that their loading design would save precious time -- and therefore boost profit. Extra flights per day could potentially make airline companies millions.

It's not the first time Airbus has patented an idea like this, or gained headlines for their efforts; they recently designed 'mezzanine' seating that would see passengers stacked on top of each other in a Hieronymus Bosch-meets-Tetris arrangement. They've also designed a number of slightly less terrifying concepts -- a VR helmet to help you forget you're flying and a 'smart baggage' system to make sure your luggage never goes astray are both examples of Airbus' dedication to innovating the airline industry.

Unfortunately for those already sold on the detachable cabin idea, it's unlikely to be made reality any time soon. Enforcing the change would involve a complete overhaul of airport infrastructure, with departure lounges and airport architecture needing to be updated or completely changed in order to accommodate the new planes.

The delivery is part of a 2013 contract between TAI and Airbus. TAI is a risk-sharing partner of the A350 program.

The Airbus A350 XWB aircraft is a new family of long-range, wide-body jet airliners developed by Airbus. The A350 XWB is the first Airbus aircraft with fuselage and wing structures made primarily of carbon fiber reinforced polymer.

The aileron, a critical control surface, is assembled on the wing of the aircraft. As part of the wing, the aileron component was designed and manufactured mainly from carbon fiber material.

TAI also produces parts for the A400M, A330 and A320 programs.

Airbus proposes new drop-in airplane “cabin modules” to speed up boarding - Ars Technica,"Thu, 26 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vYXJzdGVjaG5pY2EuY29tL2NhcnMvMjAxNS8xMS9haXJidXMtcHJvcG9zZXMtbmV3LWRyb3AtaW4tYWlycGxhbmUtY2FiaW4tbW9kdWxlcy10by1zcGVlZC11cC1ib2FyZGluZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Every few months, a crazy patent or research paper pops up that promises to revolutionise air travel. A few years ago, an astrophysicist devised a dehumanising algorithm that can decrease airplane boarding times by almost half, as long as you don't mind being split up from whoever else you're travelling with. Then, of course, there was Ryanair's idea of replacing normal seats with standing seats: near-vertical seats that have a tiny little ledge to rest your bum on.

Today, Airbus has been granted a patent (US 9,193,460) on a method that essentially turns an airplane into an articulated truck. The plane, instead of being a single, contiguous hull, would have a huge hole in the middle where the passengers and luggage would normally be. Instead of boarding the plane directly, passengers and luggage would be loaded into a separate ""cabin module."" Then, when the module is ready to go, it's simply dropped into the airplane. If you ever watched Thunderbirds as a kid, it's a lot like Thunderbird 2.

The purpose of the patent, in Airbus' own words, is to ""reduce the immobilisation time of the aircraft and air terminal."" In more human terms, this patent is all about reducing turnaround time. Instead of milling around in the departure lounge while an incoming plane is disembarked, cleaned, and restocked, you could already be taking your place in the drop-in cabin module. Likewise, hold luggage could be loaded up instantly, rather than waiting for the incoming plane to be emptied.

The gallery above shows one possible way that these cabin modules could be filled and then dropped into an airplane chassis. The patent's sketches seem to assume that the departure lounge itself has been retrofitted/updated to cater for these drop-in modules.

The patent doesn't say how much time would be saved by these processes, but presumably it would be a few minutes at least. Turnaround time is one of the main limiting factors on how many flights can be flown each day: if an airline could squeeze in another flight, or even just reduce the number of late-in-the-day flights being delayed, that would be a huge deal.

Personally, I think cabin modules are a lot better than Airbus' other recent patent for stacked overhead seating, or the aforementioned standing seats.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998112320899963}",neutral,0.9998112320899963,0
Airbus Scrambles To Compete Against France's Planned Buy of 4 C-130s - Defense News,"Sat, 07 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS90cmFpbmluZy1zaW0vMjAxNS8xMS8wNy9haXJidXMtc2NyYW1ibGVzLXRvLWNvbXBldGUtYWdhaW5zdC1mcmFuY2Utcy1wbGFubmVkLWJ1eS1vZi00LWMtMTMwcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — France's planned acquisition of four C-130 Hercules for €330 million (US $361 million) has fueled a debate between the armed forces and procurement officials over buying the US airlifter, while Airbus scrambles to develop a competing offer, defense executive and analyst sources said.

Later this month, France expects to receive a US letter of acceptance setting out the price of four Lockheed Martin C-130Js, a defense specialist said.

The financial details from the US are eagerly awaited as the revised multi-year budget sets aside funds for the four C-130s, two of which will be fitted for helicopter in-flight refueling.

The office of the defense minister asked for an official letter of request to be sent to the US as there was concern over an unofficial French estimate of US $800 million for four C-130Js and two years of maintenance, the specialist said. The price of the C-130J is tightly held, so the US reply will help Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian decide the procurement path by year's end.

Airlifters are a key asset, air chief Gen. André Lanata told the parliamentary defense committee.

""As to transport aircraft, this is a sensitive capability as it is very much in demand in the field and deserves close attention,"" he said on Oct. 7. ""The C-130 fleet constitutes an indispensable complement to the A400M, particularly for missions conducted by the special f orces.""

French authorities are studying two options: buying older, secondhand aircraft or new planes from the US, he said.

That acquisition would modernize the capability and deliver a long-term solution as the service would fly the A400M as a ""strategic"" cargo lifter, and the C-130 for ""medium"" loads, which would help the special forces, he said. ""The two fleets … would be complementary,"" he said.

The French forces asked for the C-130s to support troops deployed against insurgents across the sub-Saharan Sahel in Africa. That request reflects a late delivery of the A400M and its lack of helicopter aerial refueling in the present version.

A key mission for the special forces is to fly helicopters for combat search and rescue missions.

Among the services there is concern a split buy of two secondhand C-130H and two new C-130J versions of the Hercules would lead to a ""micro fleet"" of the latter, which would be costly to maintain, a defense specialist said.

Buying secondhand planes saves money in the short term, but there are worries about the long-term maintenance costs, an officer said.

A secondhand batch is being considered as the €330 million budget is too low for four of the J model, the specialist said. There is concern among the services on why such a low figure was submitted to the budget law, as that slows down acquisition of the new C-130J.

A slow and complex acquisition of the Hercules is seen as helping Airbus, which could compete with its C-295 and A400M airlifters.

The Direction Générale de l'Armement — the French defense procurement agency — was unavailable for comment.

Airbus is developing a refueling kit for its C-295 medium transport, Miguel Angel Morell, head of engineering at Airbus Defence & Space, told journalists on Oct. 27 in Seville. The kit also would fit on the C-235 light transport, allowing the planes to carry respectively nine and six tons of fuel.

The transport planes could refuel helicopters, turboprop aircraft and UAVs. Airbus aims to build a new control system for hose and drogue, and update technology that stems from the 1950s and 1970s.

Airbus aims to be ready this year to deploy in flight a hose and drogue on the C-295. A ground test bench has started for system validation, with a hose installed.

Other work on the C-295 includes an extreme short take-off and landing under 500 meters, and a new defensive aids suite using a directional infrared countermeasure against missile attacks.

Airbus is working to find a solution to helicopter refueling on the A400M, a contractual capability which has generated technical problems, as the four powerful turboprop engines generate aerodynamic risk for helicopters.

Airbus is in advanced negotiations on the A400M with nine prospective clients, said Antonio Rodriguez Barberan, head of military aircraft sales.

The French Air Force has 27 Transall C-160s, which are nearing the end of operational life, 14 Hercules, and 27 CN-235.

Britain is considering extending the operational life of the C130-Js, and the strategic defense and security review may refer to the Hercules.

UPDATE: Airbus to ultimately uncouple IFE and connectivity on A350 - Runway Girl Network,"Thu, 05 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTUvMTEvYWlyYnVzLXRvLXVsdGltYXRlbHktdW5jb3VwbGUtaWZlLWFuZC1jb25uZWN0aXZpdHktb24tYTM1MC14d2Iv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Though we’ve long known that Zodiac Inflight Innovations’ RAVE seat-centric inflight entertainment system was in line for linefit offerability on the Airbus A350 and A330, and logic dictates that Zii’s new role as BFE ‘point person’ for Inmarsat Global Xpress (GX) inflight connectivity on the A320, A330 and A380 – an unbundled approach – would pave the way for a Zii connectivity offering on the A350 as well, confirmation finally came in the form of a recent press release.

But Airbus’ approved terminology can be confusing, so it’s important to clarify two key points, courtesy of Zii VP of sales and marketing Harry Gray:

Zii’s broadband offering with Airbus is under their designation as HBC (High Bandwidth Connectivity). This offering is provided as buyer furnished equipment (BFE) and supports the A320 (Family), A330, and A380 platforms.

Zii also has ATM (Authorization to Market) for the Zii broadband system (same hardware as HBC) to be provided as a linefit solution for the A350 platform. This offering is provided as part of the Aircraft Contracted Supplier (ACS) catalog approach and is currently paired with a Zii IFE solution. As of today it is not possible to select a Panasonic IFE and the Zii broadband solution – or vice versa.

This means that, thus far, Airbus continues to pair same-vendor IFE and connectivity on the A350 (as the A350 catalog first revealed to us in 2011). But the wheels are in motion for that paradigm to change.

In a lengthy interview with RGN about how its HBC program will evolve (expect more broadband solutions to be approved as linefit on the A320, A330 and A380), Airbus interiors marketing manager Patrick Candelier said, “Today, A350 is not part of HBC; it’s just a question of timing. Now I would be out of my role [to say more]… But clearly, what is true is that what we want to offer to our customers is the same possibility on any aircraft type. They will replicate their requests [on A330, for example] on A350 also, and at some point in time we will converge. The reason for it simply is already we’re announcing the same approach for three different programs; now the A350, with a different business model again, so there [it] will come into the loop afterwards.”

During a follow-up interview with RGN, Candelier stressed that today “the only thing we can offer is a bundled offer. Today our status, our decision, is Airbus is still not ready to uncouple.” However, Airbus expects to field requests from airlines to unbundle IFE and connectivity in the future.

When Airbus ultimately uncouples the two, a variety of vendors will benefit from the move, and classic rivals could inevitably end up working together on IFEC integration projects.

For example, Delta Air Lines is the largest embedded IFE customer of Panasonic Avionics, but it has selected Gogo’s 2Ku connectivity solution for the A350-900 and other types, including the A330-900Neo. Delta’s first A350 delivery is scheduled for 2017. It’s unclear if 2Ku will even be a linefit option for the carrier when it finalizes its interior layout for the twinjet (at least 18 months before delivery), though Gogo CEO Michael Small assured during a third quarter earnings conference call today (to report a 22% y-o-y revenue increase) that the Chicago-based firm is making headway at both Airbus and Boeing.

“It is a long process to get linefit for the very clear reasons that neither Airbus nor Boeing is going to delay delivery of an aircraft because one of their vendors lets them down. We are deeply in that process with both Airbus and Boeing with increasing enthusiasm by both OEMs and have every reason to believe 2Ku is in [line for] linefit for all the major aircraft types,” said Small.

Pressed by RGN to describe how far along is Gogo in obtaining linefit for 2Ku on the A350 for customer Delta or indeed Panasonic Ku on the A320 (the A320 is the only Airbus platform that Panasonic Ku is not yet linefit offerable on), Airbus’s Candelier insisted, “I can’t be precise about discussions; and cannot elaborate about names of suppliers or technology so [they’re] free to announce what they want in the press. We review all the extras that are strong enough and credible enough. I know it’s a kind of non-answer. This is really the situation. In short we will make an announcement; I don’t know who will come out of this negotiation phase and so it’s at that moment that we will communicate as we did for Zodiac.”

For it’s part, Delta tells RGN: “Delta is still in the process of determining the specifics of our A350 aircraft delivery. Because of our unique operational perspective [inclusive of Delta TechOps, which retrofits Gogo solutions to Delta aircraft today], we have the flexibility to consider a number of options prior to delivery and placement of aircraft into service.” Indeed, Gogo has made broader headway in retrofitting 2Ku to aircraft, having fitted the solution to an A340 operated by Delta partner Virgin Atlantic, as well as an Aeromexico Boeing 737.

Meanwhile, Zii is still working to secure a customer for its complete coupled IFEC offering on the A350. It has a “couple in the works right now which is exciting” but is not quite there yet in terms of final deals, reveals Zii’s Gray.

And though Global Xpress forms the basis of Zii’s connectivity offering across Airbus’ portfolio, this doesn’t mean Zii won’t pair RAVE IFE with other connectivity systems where it makes sense via retrofit. “So depending upon the airline, maybe an air-to-ground solution is better; depending on the airline, maybe a Ku-band solution is okay, or a Ka-band solution… So we’ve got the ability to provide that as a turnkey package, certainly on a retrofit basis to provide the right solution for that particular airline but also give them the support of that particular product, and also get it installed and certified, where we have great expertise within the organization to get that done.”

Though Airbus (EADSY) has downplayed the disappointment, this news represents a continuing downward trend for a the world’s largest passenger airliner, which was once hailed as the future of aviation—and a fundamental shift in the way we fly.

“The A380 is what people romanticized about airlines in the past,” says Vinay Bhaskara, senior business analyst with the trade publication Airways News. “It’s the spiritual successor for Boeing’s 747. But that [kind of] aircraft isn’t as relevant to today’s airline network.”

The A380 first flew in 2007, promising to carry as many as 800 passengers long distances between major hubs. The hope was that the massive jet would free up berths at the world’s busiest airports and deliver excellent fuel efficiency, while also offering optional top-end amenities such as gyms and lounges.

But global change has put the A380 at a disadvantage against smaller planes, most notably Boeing’s (BA) 787 Dreamliner, which went into operation in 2011. Despite notorious technical problems with the 787, Boeing has taken more than 1,100 orders. So far, Airbus has received only a little over 300 orders for the A380.

The two planes don’t make for an apples-to-apples comparison, but they aren’t meant to. This is because the battle, now apparently decided, wasn’t really between two planes, but between two predictions about the world’s air travel market.

The A380 was built to shuttle passengers between the world’s largest hubs, with transfers to smaller planes to get them to their final destinations. But that’s no longer what air travel looks like.

“The trend,” says Bhaskara, “is to ever-increasing dispersion.” Developing regional economies have created greater demand for flights, not just from London to Singapore, but to second-tier destinations like Jakarta and Manila. Long-range, mid-sized planes like the Dreamliner are better suited to those routes.

Even between major hubs, the A380 seems to have less appeal than Airbus hoped, as airlines focus on service and agility.

“On a key business route like London-New York, high frequency is seen as a greater benefit than high capacity,” says Chris Brunning of the Brown + Hudson travel agency.

But it’s not all bad news for Airbus. Though the A380 is unlikely to recoup its development cost, the plane’s waning relevance isn’t an existential threat to the French builder, which has already pivoted to better match the market. Their A350, a smaller jet intended to compete more directly with the Dreamliner, received nearly 800 orders as of October.

The factory is set to be 10,000 square meters and will house the H215 production from procurement to after-sales, including design office activities. The facilities are planned to provide over 300 jobs in the long term.

At the ceremony held by Guillaume Faury, CEO of Airbus Helicopters, with Romanian Secretary of State Alexandru Nastase in attendance, the company set down the factory’s foundation stone.

Airbus also highlighted the facility’s assembly line will be able to produce up to 15 aircraft per year with the first roll out planned for 2017.

The H215 is a continuation of the former AS332 C1e/L1e rotorcraft. It is a twin-engine helicopter that combines advanced avionics and a platform for rugged multi-mission capabilities, Airbus said. Other features include long-range capabilities, a large payload, “very good” lifting performance in hot and high environments, EASA and FAA certification, and a glass cockpit with a 4-axis autopilot.

“The H215 is of strategic importance to Airbus Helicopters and will allow us to offer customers the best helicopter for the job, all with extremely competitive direct operating and maintenance costs. This expanded partnership with Romania, an important EU and NATO member, will ensure that our legacy twin-engine heavy helicopters are more economical than ever on current and emerging markets,” Guillaume Faury, CEO of Airbus Helicopters, said.

H125s are planned to come off the assembly line in a standard configuration but can support a list of optionals (“shopping list”) ready to be selected, Airbus said.

“This new concept will allow the aircraft to best meet customers’ expectations and serve a wide range of missions, providing a modern and cost-effective solution for markets such as utility, United Nations peacekeeping operations and logistic support missions,” the company said in a statement.

“This new 100 percent Airbus Helicopters industrial center is capitalizing on a successful history of aircraft heavy maintenance and complex upgrade programs in Romania and cooperation in the country that goes back more than 40 years,” Serge Durand, managing director of Airbus Helicopters Industries, said.

“The aim is to offer our customers a completely new and modern business concept by proposing a standardized equipment definition for rapid production times and cost-effective acquisition prices,” he added.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.994082510471344}",neutral,0.994082510471344,0

The concept hasthe potential to revolutionize air travel, while providingsignificant savings for airlines by reducing the time that planesspend idle on the ground.

After landing, and prior to launch, aconventional aeroplane has to sit on the tarmac waiting for anecessary but glacial set of events to unfold. This periodof inactivity, which is the combined result of a number of factorsincluding the embarking of passengers, luggage and freight, costsairlines time and money.

The newly patented concept would seekto remedy these limitations by taking a more modular approach to the wholesituation. Instead of a single hull, aeroplanes would essentially bebuilt with a hole in their fuselage between the nose cone and thetail section, into which modular compartments could be fitted andremoved.

The compartments, which could take onthe purpose of a passenger, luxury passenger or freight unit, wouldbe transferred between the aircraft and airport via a docking module,which according to Airbus would (ideally) be integrated into airportterminal buildings.

The cost of creating and implementing such a system, paired with unforeseen complications in the development process, as well as the significant alterations you'd have to make to current airport architectures, means we won't be taking a ride in a modular airliner any time soon Airbus/USPTO

Such a system would allow passengers tobe seated, or cargo to be loaded over an extended period of timewhile the cabin was docked in the terminal without the need toimmobilize the aircraft beyond the time necessary to carry outpreflight operations such as refuelling, the cleaning of a cabin, andthe execution of routine technical checks. This would dramaticallyreduce inactivity time, with the effect of increasing the overallnumber of flights, and therefore profitability of the airline.

Furthermore, the implementation of amodular system would afford airlines an unprecedented level offlexibility in the make up of their fleet. Ordinarily, each aircraftis purpose built to serve as, for example, a passenger or freightservice. Therefore, under the current integrated aircraft designs, anairline would have to purchase additional aircraft or make costlymodifications to existing units to serve multiple roles.

A modular approach to aircraftconstruction would allow an airline to switch the purpose of a planein a matter of hours simply by replacing the cabin, ready to cater tothe short term needs of the airline with a level of cost effectiveefficiency that cannot be matched by single-hull aircraft.

It's fair to say that such a systemwould represent a huge leap forward in the commercial aviationsphere. But of course, it's very early days. The cost of creating andimplementing such a system, paired with unforeseen complications inthe development process, as well as the significant alterations you'dhave to make to current airport architectures, means we won't betaking a ride in a modular airliner any time soon.

Airbus Working on Passive Radar System - Second Line of Defense - Second Line of Defense,"Wed, 04 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vc2xkaW5mby5jb20vMjAxNS8xMS9haXJidXMtd29ya2luZy1vbi1wYXNzaXZlLXJhZGFyLXN5c3RlbS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"2015-11-04 By Guy Martin

European defense giant Airbus Defence and Space is developing a passive radar system that will soon be available to customers.

Active radars have been around for decades but they have their disadvantages, according to Frank Bernhardt: Head of Program: Passive Radar at Airbus Defence and Space Electronics. By emitting a signal, active radars give away their positions and although there are various ways in which they can try and avoid detection, this is a significant drawback. Other limitations are emitting radiation that can interfere with other signals or can violate health and safety rules (such as emitting in a built-up area).

The idea of passive radar technology has been around since the 1930s, with Robert Watson-Watt performing experiments in 1935. However, it was not until some 20 years ago that technology (especially computer power) matured enough for passive radar to become viable.

The first passive radar systems were bistatic – in other words, the transmitter and receiver were in different places. Modern passive radar uses any transmitter of opportunity to detect disturbances and reflections in electromagnetic signals in order to determine the position of an object. Bernhardt said that FM radio signals and digital video broadcasting signals are the main passive radar sensors as they are strong emitters good for air surveillance.

Bernhardt said that the resurgence of passive radar has come about because of the availability of advanced processing technology that requires huge computing power. Another driver is the fact that there are a lot more emitters out there, providing many more signals to work with – if there are no electromagnetic signals in the atmosphere, passive radar obviously cannot work.

Bernhardt said that a passive radar system needs several transmitters and receivers to detect targets. The current Airbus system uses FM, digital audio and digital video transmissions to provide 360-degree coverage and three dimensional tracking. Tracks are updated every one to two seconds as the radar processes incoming signals. Range, using FM, is up to 250 km (for a commercial aircraft size target) with 500 meters accuracy while using digital audio and video broadcasting gives a range of up to 30 km with 10 meter accuracy. The passive radar software is sophisticated enough to detect helicopter and propeller blades, giving an indication of what type of aircraft has been detected.

Some of the many benefits to passive radar include jam resistance (it would require enormous power to jam all transmitters in an area), covert operation, silent operation, low power consumption, safety (no emissions, allowing it to be used in built up areas like suburbs and harbors), low cost (no moving parts or transmitter) and no frequency interference.

Another benefit of passive radar is that it can detect stealthy aircraft. It uses low (less than 1 GHz) frequencies, which stealth aircraft aren’t designed to absorb. Although Airbus hasn’t done trials with stealth aircraft, Bernhardt said that he believes passive radar could be promising in this regard although this was not the main reason for developing the technology.

Although passive radar has many defence applications, it has also been promoted for air traffic control as it can be used in built-up areas and has a relatively low cost. Airbus Defence and Space has been exploring the use of passive radar for air traffic control with Germany and the United Kingdom.

The Airbus passive radar mounts passive radar antennas on a 14 metre folding mast fitted to a Mercedes Sprinter vehicle. The radar is able to detect large and small aircraft out to hundreds of kilometers, giving their position, speed and height.

Passive radar is still a relatively early technology which Lothar Belz, Airbus Senior Manager Media Relations, believes will only mature in about five years’ time. At present it is not accurate enough for things like fire control. Nevertheless, Bernhardt said that “We are forming passive radar into a viable product.”

Airbus has been heavily involved in the development of passive radar since 2011/12 but certification, qualification and so on still has to be done, with viable systems only making it onto the marketplace in several years’ time. In the meantime, quite a number of potential customers have expressed interest in the technology, including NATO countries.

As Airbus Defence and Space is still developing the technology, it has various improvements in the works, such as exploring the exploitation of satellite transmitters (such as digital video broadcasting for handheld devices) and LTE and other waveforms such as cellphone signals. Bernhardt predicts that 20 years into the future, passive radars will be mounted on aircraft and be able to move around on the ground.

Last month, the French Air Force said the first flight of a passive airborne radar took place at Air Base 701 at Salon-de-Provence, in south-eastern France on 16 October. Since 2013, the French air force Academy, Ecole de l’Air, has carried out passive radar research. The project is a joint effort of the Centre de Recherche de l’Ecole de l’Air (CReA), the National Office for Aerospace Research (ONERA), and the SONDRA laboratory, a joint venture between ONERA and the Central-Supélec school.

The experimental aircraft used for these tests was a Busard motoglider belonging to ONERA, fitted with a complete receiver system that was specially developed for the project, and which in particular can be integrated into a pod carried by the aircraft. The French Air Force said that data integrity was validated and data is currently being processed by the project team to further develop processing methods especially tailored to the airborne environment.

As passive radar (also known as passive coherent location, passive bistatic radar, piggyback radar and covert radar) is such as promising field, it has attracted a number of companies like Thales (with its Aulos), Selex (with its Homeland Alerter 100) and Elta. In the 1990s Lockheed Martin developed its Silent Sentry system that used FM radio towers as a source of radiation.

South Africa is one of a few countries in the world to have successfully developed a passive radar system. The University of Cape Town, in association with Peralex Electronics and CSIR Defence, Peace, Safety and Security (DPSS) developed a prototype system that can be deployed in the field. During testing, three receiver sites were established in the Western Cape and the system was used to detect airliners at ranges of 150 km. Testing was also done at the Paardefontein range outside Pretoria, where a light aircraft (Cessna 172) was successfully detected and tracked.

Guy Martin visited the Airbus Defence and Space Electronics facility in Ulm, Germany, as a guest of the company.

Despite the final designs for the new chopper being finalized in-house at Airbus, it was Peugeot Design Lab who got the ball rolling after winning a style competition launched by Airbus, aimed at finding outside influences and creating a new benchmark in helicopter styling.

The H160 is a sleek, dynamic new medium-twin helicopter, set to go on sale in 2016. The new model was designed for versatility, being able to commute to offshore platforms, going on public-service missions, providing emergency medical services as well as handling the day to day rigors set by private businesses and aviation.

“We used the initial styling developed by PEUGEOT Design Lab to define a strong personality for the rotorcraft—a mirror reflection of the innovation, performance and emotion unique to the H160. We developed a helicopter based on the PEUGEOT Design Lab design which immediately caught the attention of both operators and the general public. Style has become a key priority for the H160 programme, which aims to make a strong impression both with its unique personality and its performance,” said Guillaume Chielens, Head of Design at Airbus Helicopters.

The H160 is indeed a very modern-looking chopper. We wouldn’t go as far as to call it futuristic, but there aren’t many other models right now that can offer a sleeker design – which some owners might appreciate.

The design team took the previous generation Dauphin model and revamped the nose while adding sleeker lines, an airframe made from composite materials, a biplane stabilizer, a canted tail rotor and Blue Edge blades.

Cathan Loughnane, Head of Peugeot global brand design studio said that “Peugeot Design Lab demonstrated its ability to take on complex technological projects through its work on the exterior design of the H160. Since it was established in 2012, an extensive range of customers have relied on the studio’s services: Dassault Aviation, Alstom, Bombardier, Leclerc, SEB, Quechua and more.”

Also, as a quick memory jog, one of the latest Peugeot Design Lab projects was the Le Bistro du Lion food truck.

Beijing CNN —

Amid much fanfare on live national television, China on Monday rolled its first homegrown large passenger jet off the production line in Shanghai, vowing to challenge the dominance of Airbus and Boeing in the global commercial aviation market.

At the ceremony, a shiny C919 – sporting a largely white fuselage with a blue wavy stripe and a green tail – was towed beneath a banner with the phrase “a dream takes off” and past a huge Chinese national flag.

The C919 – a twin-engine, narrow-body aircraft seating up to 174 people – is similar in size to the Airbus 320 and Boeing 737 series of jets, long the workhorses for airlines around the world.

With a flying range of up to 5,555 kilometers (3,451 miles), it is designed to compete head-to-head with its Airbus and Boeing rivals, and said to easily cover popular business and leisure routes from China such as Shanghai to Singapore and Beijing to Bangkok.

Launched in 2008, the C919 project marks China’s return to the business of making large passenger jetliners, after a failed attempt in the 1980s.

Homegrown?

Although the C919’s maiden flight is at least a year away, its manufacturer, the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), has already made no secret of its future plans to make another, wide-body airliner.

The Communist government also wants to use the C919 as a springboard to develop a nationwide aviation industry, boasting the involvement of more than 200 companies, 36 universities and hundreds of thousands of personnel in the plane’s development.

Video Ad Feedback See Boeing Dreamliner built in hyperspeed 01:15 - Source: CNN

State media are touting the “advanced technologies” used throughout the plane, from new avionics to an airframe partially made of light composite materials, as Boeing has done on its 787 Dreamliner.

However, some aviation enthusiasts in China are not so sure about the state media’s claim that the C919 is a product of “complete Chinese intellectual property.”

Compiling published information, CNN was able to verify a widely shared graphic that indicates that many key components of the C919 are made overseas – including the engines (by U.S.-French joint venture CFM International), power system and landing gears (both by U.S.-based Honeywell).

Explosive growth

One thing not in dispute is China’s hunger for new passenger jets as its aviation market continues its explosive growth.

Already the world’s second largest air travel market after the United States, China will need more than 6,300 new planes over the next two decades, according to a recent Boeing forecast.

Airbus holds a similarly bullish view and has been assembling its popular A320 family aircraft in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin since 2008.

During President Xi Jinping’s recent state visit to the United States, China signed a deal with Boeing to purchase 300 airliners worth $38 billion at list prices.

When German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited Beijing last week, China also announced that it would buy 130 Airbus jets valued at $17 billion.

End of duopoly?

Small wonder that state media are channeling Comac’s confidence about the C919’s bright future.

The company expects to sell 2,000 aircraft in the coming 20 years and some Chinese commentators even predict an A-B-C (Airbus-Boeing-Comac) three-way fight for market share in the long run.

So far, the C919 has received 517 orders, mostly from state-owned Chinese carriers and domestic aircraft leasing companies.

The lack of certification from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is seen as a major hindrance for international sales.

And Chinese public reactions have seemed mixed online. While many express pride and support in an indigenous jetliner, others sound skeptical about the safety of an entirely made-in-China plane.

Some Internet users have made a point of saying they will feel comfortable flying the C919 when it is used as China’s “Air Force One.”

For now and in the foreseeable future, though, it’s a safe bet that President Xi will continue to ride a specially configured Boeing 747 jumbo jet when he travels abroad.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9767171144485474}",neutral,0.9767171144485474,0

So, how the hell did they do it?

It took two months to prepare for shooting thanks to the safety and logistical demands: six flyers were in close proximity – the A380 and the two Jetmen, the Jetmen’s helicopter, and a plane and helicopter for the film team – only a few thousand feet above downtown Dubai and the Palm Jumeirah. The team filmed three flights with the Jetmen alongside the plane. There was also a fourth solo flight by the A380 to get some scenic footage of the plane over Oman and the UAE.

Around 25 people worked on the production, which was made by Dubai Film for the companies Jetman Dubai and Emirates, though the overall team for the stunt numbered 40 or so including pilots, air traffic controllers and so on. “It was a massive undertaking and and took a lot of effort to pull off” says Phil.The A380 was out of passenger service for two days and the take off shots required the closure of both runways at Dubai International airport.

The team had worked with Jetman Yves Rossy and Jetman Junior Vince Reffet before, so knew roughly what they could expect. “Having said that, they were going fast, because 135 knots is the slowest an A380 can go in midflight with full flaps. The biggest challenge was having a camera platform that could match the speed of Jetman and the A380.”

They used an Aerovision jet brought from France: a modified plane that you can film from “with a periscope type system mounted to the top or bottom of the jet”, which is normally used for footage for airline commercials and the like.

“The Aerovision jet can actually go within the wingspan of the A380 – so shooting close proximity footage is more exciting than ever before,” says Phil. He was working mostly from the helicopter, which could not fly as fast as the jet. “We did shots where the A380 was cornering and cut the corner, shooting above the plane,” he says.

“When we passed over the A380 with only a couple of hundred feet to spare – that was pretty insane. I thought: Treasure this moment, because it will never happen again. On one shot, we got caught in the wake turbulence of the A380, so the helicopter was shaking in the rough air, but our competent pilots made sure we stayed safe.”

The A380 and the Jetmen flew at 4,000 feet, with the other aircraft involved not far above them.

“Jetmen can only fly for about ten minutes so you probably get two to three minutes of really good footage per flight,” he notes.

The stunning shot of the Jetmen either side of the plane was filmed from the jet and was “one of the simpler shots to pull off. The two jetmen lined up left and right of the A380, the Corvette Camera Jet lined up slightly above and behind and the Jetmen started their smoke systems,” says Phil. The footage at the end of the film of the Jetmen pulling off to the top and bottom, meanwhile, was filmed from the helicopter.

“You need to anticipate what’s going to happen. We didn’t know how the break-off was going to go…as planned as everything was, you never knew exactly what was going to happen. There are always some variables when there are so many moving parts” says Phil.

“Going into a project like Jetman, puts your mind on edge. You’re quite stressed about safety and pulling off the shots, but once the shooting starts, it’s 100% concentration and focus in the moment. After the flights and a safe touchdown by all aircraft, it all seemed very surreal.”

The Jetmen and A380 were in constant radio communication for safety reasons and the camera jet could also listen in. The precision of the safety requirements meant that filming plans were set in stone; there was no room for improvisation if the film teams thought they had spotted a better opportunity for a shot while in flight.

Of course, the teams also had to ensure that they stayed out of each other’s shots. “You need a pilot who is used to flying for film productions – flying in the perfect position to keep the aircraft out of the shot. Andy [the in-house helicopter pilot at Dubai Film] is an incredibly talented film-pilot and has multiple big film credits under his belt.”

Camera gear:

The helicopter was equipped with a RED Epic Dragon mounted inside of a Shotover F1 6-axis gyro stabilised camera platform. The lens was a Canon 30-300mm Cine Servo zoom lens. Phil operated the camera from the helicopter’s passenger seat using a custom gimbal and camera control panel. The direction of the gimbal was aimed using a joystick and the lens controlled with FIZ motors. A large monitor was used to frame shots and to make sure things were in focus. Phil described operating the setup as being “kinda like playing a video game”.

He explained that the most difficult thing about aerials is keeping a pan smooth while following subjects when there is a change of perspective. It was all too easy to accidentally jerk the pan and lose the shot.

As he was using a RED he was shooting in RAW. “We were shooting everything on 6K. The lens only covers 5K. If you zoom out wide you’re going to get porthole vignetting; we put on frame guides for 5K so we could crop it in post.”

He used 512 GB cards, which gave him around 45 minutes of shooting – plenty of time given the short duration of the flights.

“One of the most difficult things was that we always took off before it was completely bright, so exposure changed quite a lot throughout the day. You have to put in the ND filters before you take off – it’s not like certain cameras where you can dial it in electronically…If you have too much ND, you end up underexposing the whole shoot, if you don’t put enough ND in, you miss hitting the sweetspot of the lens. It’s judging and knowing a bit about exposure. You really need to plan ahead.”

[Jet] “We put a Dragon in the Corvette camera jet. The lens is a PL modified Nikon 80-200mm f2.8 stills lens. The lens needs to sit as close to the glass of the periscope system as possible, so the lens has to be quite short, which limits the types of lenses you can use. The optics of the 80-200 are great, so we were happy with the footage we got.

“The operator in the camera jet is sitting in an arm chair, controlling the camera with joysticks in his left and right hand. The system is not gyro-stabilised, so when the plane banks, the camera system will also roll, which has to be corrected manually by the operator.”

There were also photographers on the helicopter and jet. The A380 was kitted out with a bunch of GoPros in the cockpit and two RED Dragons were used to film on-board. “We shot out of the windows and just had big pieces of blackout fabric to block out the reflections around the windows.”

On top of that, the Jetmen had GoPro Hero 4s on them shooting 4K: one built into each wingtip of the jet wings, plus one on each man’s knees and helmets. “That footage is the coolest footage from the whole shoot, because it seems so real,” Phil adds.

The film was edited by its director Anthony Augustinack, working to a tight ten-day deadline. “Tony knew exactly what he wanted; the first rough cut was done in a relatively short time. Then it was fine tuning everything, working with a composer in LA for the music, and then colouring and sound effects in Dubai,” Phil says.

There will also be a director’s cut and multiple 15-second videos have been put together for release on Instagram.

Could the next step be jet-powered cinematography?

“I already put my name in the hat if they ever want to recruit another Jetman,” says Phil, who is a skydiver.

“It would be very cool to shoot from the jet wing – but you fly the Jetwing with your body, so focusing on operating a camera at the same time would be a big challenge. They have a throttle for their hand with which they can control the acceleration – the rest is just steering with your body.”

Peugeot Photo

Airbus Helicopters is presenting its new civil helicopter, the H160, at the Dubai Airshow from Nov. 8-12.

Peugeot Design Lab drew up the initial plans for the helicopter’s exterior design, which were then adapted, developed and finalized by the in-house design team at Airbus Helicopters.

The sleek, dynamic lines of the H160 represent a new aesthetic for the helicopters in the product range, reflecting the generational leap embodied by the model.

The Dubai Airshow is an international, biennial event that drew over 60,000 visitors in 2013. At this year’s airshow, Airbus Helicopters is presenting the H160, its new medium-twin helicopter whose commercialization will begin in 2016.

This versatile model is designed to perform a wide range of duties, including service to offshore platforms, public-service missions, medical evacuations and coastal surveillance, as well as business and private aviation.

The designers at Peugeot Design Lab began work on the H160 (then known as the X4) after winning an in-house style competition, launched by Airbus Helicopters in an aim to get outside influences and to create a new benchmark with regards to helicopter style.

The in-house design team at Airbus Helicopters then developed and fine-tuned Peugeot’s initial design to create the aircraft presented this year.

“We used the initial styling developed by Peugeot Design Lab to define a strong personality for the rotorcraft—a mirror reflection of the innovation, performance and emotion unique to the H160. We developed a helicopter based on their design which immediately caught the attention of both operators and the general public. Style has become a key priority for the H160 program, which aims to make a strong impression both with its unique personality and its performance,” said Guillaume Chielens, head of style and design at Airbus Helicopters.

The futuristic contours of the H160, which are enhanced by the helicopter’s tapered windows, represent the culmination of the design project. The styling offers an updated take on the previous generation, the Dauphin, whose iconic nose has been revamped.

The sleek lines of the H160 convey how efficient and quiet it is in the air—performance achieved through a series of innovations, including an airframe made from composite materials, a biplane stabilizer, a canted tail rotor and Blue Edge blades.

“Peugeot Design Lab demonstrated its ability to take on complex technological projects through its work on the exterior design of the H160,”explained Cathal Loughnane, head of the Peugeot global brand design studio.

Since it was established in 2012, an extensive range of customers have relied on the studio’s services: Dassault Aviation, Alstom, Bombardier, Leclerc, SEB, Quechua and more. One of the latest Peugeot Design Lab projects is the Peugeot Food Truck, Le Bistro du Lion.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9798272848129272}",neutral,0.9798272848129272,0
Airbus Helicopters to revive Romanian aircraft manufacturing | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLXRvLXJldml2ZS1yb21hbmlhbi1haXJjcmFmdC1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLzExODkzMi5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Romania's aircraft manufacturing industry, dormant since 2004, is being revived by Airbus Helicopters, which is to begin production of its legacy Super Puma models at a new facility near Brasov.

The airframer currently assembles the AS332 L1e and C1e variants – from today redesignated as the H215 – at its Marignane plant in the south of France. But from 2017, production of the 8.6t maximum take-off weight helicopter will progressively begin at the new factory, reaching full-rate production of 15-20 aircraft per year from 2019. Initial deliveries in 2017 will be confined to the short fuselage (C1e) model, with the 76cm-longer variant added from 2019.

Airbus Helicopters is targeting the rotorcraft at the utility, aerial work, humanitarian assistance, and basic troop transport segments.

It faces competition from the Mil Mi-8/17, but believes that the new production system it is adopting at Brasov – arranged around a flow line – plus lower Romanian labour costs, and a simplified configuration of the baseline helicopter will enable it to successfully compete against the Russian-built type.

""It brings to the market what the market needs for this segment,"" said Guillaume Faury, Airbus Helicopters chief executive, speaking at an event to mark the start of construction at the site. ""Thanks to this new streamlined industrial model, we will be able to produce one of the most affordable heavy helicopters in the world here in Brasov,"" he adds.

The airframer had already began taking steps to simplify its Super Puma models, with the 2010 launch of the C1e being a step towards that goal. The variant features a stripped-down baseline configuration and a reduction in the amount of factory-installed equipment available, while gaining the four-axis autopilot and avionics from the heavier H225.

Production time on the C1e was already three months shorter than the 21 months required for the previous iteration, but Airbus Helicopters believes further simplification of the configuration and the new production line can cut it to 11 months in total.

Airbus Helicopters

The airframer is investing €50 million ($53.2 million) in the purpose-built, 10,000m2 facility, which will be operated by a new company, Airbus Helicopters Industries. It has had a presence in the central European country since 2002, with Airbus Helicopters Romania (AHR) – a joint venture with state-owned aerospace company IAR – developing a successful maintenance, repair and overhaul business.

However, the new entity is 100% owned by Airbus Helicopters, ""because we wanted to be in full control of our future,"" says Fabrice Arfi, vice-president of business development.

The new facility will provide work for 300 people, in addition to the 160 employed at AHR, with an initial cadre of 23 already receiving training in Marignane.

And, says Faury, the decision to build the H215 in Romania will ""develop the supply chain and the network of companies supporting us"".

Arfi believes it can achieve 30-35% Romanian content on the helicopter – including the value of labour – within five years. It is already working to secure its local supply chain, he says, with contracts to be signed next year.

He is confident that major suppliers to the programme can be encouraged to move to Brasov, including potentially engine manufacturer Turbomeca, which provides the H215's twin Makila 1A1 engines.

Aside from the benefits for H215 production, the creation of the line at Brasov will allow Airbus Helicopters to free-up valuable space at its Marignane site for the assembly of its H175 super medium and developmental H160 medium-class rotorcraft.

Airbus or The Boeing Company: Which Is the Better Stock? - The Motley Fool,"Mon, 09 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy9nZW5lcmFsLzIwMTUvMTEvMDkvYWlyYnVzLW9yLXRoZS1ib2VpbmctY29tcGFueS13aGljaC1pcy10aGUtYmV0dGVyLXMuYXNweNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Both plane makers' businesses are booming -- but one's booming louder than the other.

It's been an amazing year for Airbus (EADSY -1.09%). All year long, and against all odds, Europe's top plane maker has thumped American arch rival Boeing (BA -2.53%) in the race to sell airplanes.

And now Airbus is beating Boeing in the race to grow profits as well.

Airbus's blockbuster year

Last month, Boeing reported strong earnings growth of 25% in its fiscal third quarter, with core earnings up an almost-as-impressive 18%. But the rest of the year's profits performance has been downright disappointing.

According to the latest tally from S&P Capital IQ, Boeing has earned $4.15 billion in profit so far this year. That's an impressive number, but it's actually only 4% better than year to date results at this time last year. Put another way, Boeing has posted just 4% year-over-year earnings growth for its first three quarters of fiscal 2015. But Airbus?

It's up 35%.

That was the headline number from Airbus's just-released fiscal Q3 (or as it calls it ""9m"") earnings report. Through the first nine months of fiscal 2015, Airbus has:

Grown revenues 6% year over year, to $47.1 billion.

Added another 40 basis points to its operating profit margin (now 6.8%).

Grown per-share earnings 35%, to $2.65 per share.

Increased the value of its plane order book by 42%.

The $122.6 billion worth of new orders Airbus has added so far this year exceeded revenues billed by 160% -- a ""book-to-bill"" ratio of 2.6. They leave Airbus's order book now overflowing with an incredible $1.06 trillion in orders awaiting fulfillment -- enough work to keep Airbus factories humming for the next 15 years straight, even if it adds not a single new order in the interim.

What's next for Airbus?

Airbus does in fact expect to continue selling airplanes, of course. And as noted in its press release, ""the strengthening U.S. dollar,"" and the relative weakening of the euro (which both lowers Airbus' costs, and makes its planes cheaper for international buyers), are both tailwinds helping to accelerate its sales. Meanwhile, to capitalize on its swelling backlog of orders to be fulfilled, the company has promised to continue acceleration production of its A320 line of aircraft, and eventually reaching a 60 planes-per-month production rate by mid-2019.

Nearer term, the company has reiterated earnings guidance that calls for ""breakeven"" free cash flow by year end, an ""increase"" in revenues, and an ""increase further"" in earnings (presumably on top of the earnings gains already booked in the year's first nine months).

Valuing Airbus

Such vague terms are difficult to hang a valuation on, but based on trailing-12-month earnings of $3.2 billion, Airbus shares currently sell for 17 times earnings. For comparison, Boeing shares sell for 18.6 times trailing earnings. Boeing's superior profitability on the planes it builds (8.3% operating profit margin for the past 12 months, versus Airbus's 4.3% margin) probably explains the small premium its share fetch on a P/E basis.

That said, if Airbus continues expanding its profit margins as it's done in recent quarters, and continues outselling Boeing as well, it's likely that the European airplane maker will grow its absolute level of profits faster than its rival. Currently, Capital IQ projects a near 15% long-term rate of annual profits growth for Airbus -- versus Boeing's growth rate of less than 11%.

This suggests that even if Boeing remains the more profitable plane builder, Airbus stock may make for the more profitable investment.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 1.0}",positive,1.0,1

Installed in an H120 demonstrator aircraft, the advanced lightweight V8 piston engine promises to be a more efficient, cleaner alternative to turbine powerplants in high-performance rotorcraft.

According to Airbus Helicopters, the new 4.6-liter, V8 high-compression piston engine demonstrates a wide variety of advanced features and technologies. With one turbocharger per cylinder bank, the engine achieves pressures of 1800 bar and has common-rail direct injection. It has fully-machined aluminum blocks, titanium connecting rods, steel pistons and liners, and for the motor oil it uses liquid-cooling and a dry sump management system similar to that used on aerobatic aircraft and race cars.

The engine has been under development since 2011 and ground tests of the H120-equipped helicopter were conducted in February and March 2015. Its maiden flight took place on November 6 at about 3 pm at Marignane Airport, France. Airbus Helicopters says that future tests will work on determining the optimum power-to-weight ratios, confirming the engine's emission standards, and making it competitive with turbine power plants.

China Rolls Out New Passenger Jet to Compete With Boeing and Airbus - Smithsonian Magazine,"Tue, 03 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtaXRoc29uaWFubWFnLmNvbS9haXItc3BhY2UtbWFnYXppbmUvY2hpbmFzLWdyZWF0LWxlYXAtZm9yd2FyZC0xODA5NTcxNDgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) yesterday rolled out the first direct challenge to airplane manufacturers Airbus and Boeing in many years. Called the Comac C919, the passenger liner unveiled in Shanghai will be put through rigorous testing, and if all goes according to plan—far from guaranteed in the aerospace manufacturing business—its first flight will be next year, with the C919 entering airline service in 2018.

The jet is stuffed with the most up-to-date technology: The engines are CFM LEAPs, the same used on Airbus and Boeing’s latest airplanes, the A320neo and 737MAX respectively (which themselves have yet to enter service). The avionics and major subsystems almost all come from proven Western suppliers (many in joint ventures with Chinese companies). The C919 is a conventional and straightforward design, breaking no technical or aerodynamic ground, befitting a risk-averse industry. Comac already boasts around 500 orders, far fewer than Boeing has for its 737MAX or Airbus for its A320neo, but certainly a respectable number. If you want to challenge the Airbus-Boeing duopoly with a low-risk solution, this seems like a good way to start.

In theory it’s a pretty good idea. China is one of the largest airliner markets in the world, and it’s growing rapidly. Chinese labor is much cheaper than European and American labor, so Comac’s airplanes will be as well. Chinese industry has years of experience building military aircraft, including transports, and even though most designs were directly copied from the Soviet Union (later Russia), recent Chinese military projects have demonstrated an increased willingness to innovate. Major Western manufacturers—McDonnell Douglas, Airbus and Embraer among them—have operated factories in China, and Boeing recently announced it would follow suit.

But all is not quite as it seems, and the C919 is a very ambitious gamble.

Virtually all of China’s aviation experience has been in service to the military, rather than the profit-minded market. The country’s few recent forays into civil aviation resulted in such flops as the Xian MA-60 (originally a derivative of Russia’s Antonov An-24) and Harbin Y-12, which are often said to be unreliable and even dangerous—not a good reputation for the commercial aviation business. Only a handful of those airplanes have sold outside China, to smaller airlines. Manufacturer and aftermarket support, critical to introducing new aircraft, have largely been absent. Chinese aircraft haven’t come close to threatening their competitors.

Despite the flashy rollout, the C919 doesn’t look like it will change the situation much. China’s centralized economy means that its airlines are largely under government control, and Beijing can (and does) tell the nation’s airlines how many airplanes they will buy and of what type, as well as where they will fly and what routes they will follow. Plans to seek certification from American and European aviation authorities (FAA and EASA respectively), the gold standards of aircraft safety, have stalled, and reports differ on whether Comac will continue trying to get certified. Even though 500 orders is an impressive feat, all but one customer is from China (the lone exception, a huge U.S.-based leasing company called GECAS, could very well lease the airplanes within China). That suggests, at best, a wait-and-see attitude from international airlines.

Still, the new airplane may not need to fly anywhere but China to make money. Just as a rising tide floats all boats, China’s rising passenger population should leave Comac plenty of room to succeed without denting the duopoly’s share (China has been ordering Airbus and Boeing aircraft at a rapid clip).

Breaking into the commercial aviation industry isn’t easy, as quite a few companies—Lockheed, Sweden’s Saab, and Germany’s Dornier among them—can attest. But none of these had the substantial political and financial backing that the Chinese government can bring to bear. And China’s not stopping there: Already there are plans for a larger aircraft to take on the Boeing 777 in a joint program with Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation.

For China this isn’t just an airplane, it’s part of national policy. China has been playing catch-up on all sorts of high-value manufacturing, everything from cars and consumer electronics to supercomputers and nuclear reactors. So far it hasn’t taken the lead in any of these industries, and Chinese goods are often perceived to be of lower quality. Of course, that could change. Following World War II Japanese goods were held in similar regard, and now companies from Japan are at the top of many industries—among them aerospace component manufacturing. Building and maintaining a commercial aircraft for domestic use will be an excellent learning experience for China’s manufacturers.

As it enters the market, China might take a lesson from Russia’s aerospace industry, which has been building commercial airliners (and many other types) for decades. Domestic (and former Soviet bloc) use is relatively high, and the latest Russian offering, Sukhoi’s Superjet 100, is by all accounts a capable and reliable airplane, with both FAA and EASA certification. But it has few foreign customers. Despite its lower acquisition costs, the Superjet’s operating costs are not quite on par with its competitors, nor is its support network. The politics of buying and maintaining Russian jets is another hurdle: The nation has been subjected to a number of political embargoes, and a ban on Russian aircraft parts is not unimaginable. Foreign airlines looking to buy from China may well bear these kinds of political factors in mind as they weigh their options.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8441315293312073}",neutral,0.8441315293312073,0

Airbus Group reorganizes global comms leadership - PR Week,"Tue, 10 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByd2Vlay5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xMzcyMTU0L2FpcmJ1cy1ncm91cC1yZW9yZ2FuaXplcy1nbG9iYWwtY29tbXMtbGVhZGVyc2hpcNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The company said Tuesday that it is integrating its communications function on a global basis.

LEIDEN, THE NETHERLANDS: Aerospace and defense giant Airbus Group is restructuring its communications function, which has about 420 staffers around the globe, the company said on Tuesday.

Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders and the chief executives of the Airbus, Airbus Helicopters, and Airbus Defense and Space divisions made the decision to integrate the comms function, the company said in a statement.

Rainer Ohler will lead the seven-member comms leadership team, effective immediately. The group includes Yves Barille, head of Airbus Helicopters communications, who will also take on the role of head of international communications coordination in emerging and developing countries.

New to the comms group is Rickard Booson, who will lead strategy and performance improvement, while Veronique Creissels, Airbus head of communications, will manage the group comms team’s digital transformation as head of digital. Airbus Defense and Space communications head Dirk Erat will integrate the group’s news and media teams in addition to his current responsibilities.

Tim Orr, Nicole Schareck, and Aline Vuillequez will oversee the branding, events and exhibitions, and group employee comms divisions, respectively.

The holding company’s various spokespeople will remain in place on the divisional level. Martin Aguera, Maggie Bergsma, and Stefan Schaffrath will be spokespeople for the Airbus Group, Defense and Space, and Airbus divisions. Meanwhile, Guillaume Steuer and Jeremy Greaves will stay as spokespeople for the helicopters division and for the UK media in London.

Ohler said in a statement that the company will take a top-to-bottom approach reorganizing comms throughout the company.

""We have chosen a pragmatic approach to the integration of the communications function,"" he said. ""The new setup is in a project mode for the time being. The leadership team will now develop a new complete organizational structure and will seek to get the appropriate works council approvals within the next couple of months.""

This summer, Airbus Group appointed Powerscourt as its retained corporate PR adviser for the UK, replacing Instinctif, whose managing partner, David Simonson, had worked with the company for 20 years.

At the end of last month, Airbus Group reported a 12% increase in its third-quarter operating profit and said it has increased production of the A320 jetliner. Its revenue was up 6% in the period.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998940229415894}",neutral,0.9998940229415894,0
Airbus Patents Way to Board Planes That's Straight out of Sci-Fi - Yahoo! Voices,"Fri, 27 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS90cmF2ZWwvYWlyYnVzLXBhdGVudHMtd2F5LXRvLWJvYXJkLXBsYW5lcy10aGF0cy1zdHJhaWdodC0xODU1MzczNjQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If the Airbus patent ever becomes reality, this boarding style would be a thing of the past. (Photo: Thinkstock)



Unless you’re deathly afraid of planes, one of the worst things about flying is the sheer tedium of it. It’s nothing but indeterminate waiting — waiting for security, waiting to board, waiting to reach your destination.

Airbus has just been granted a patent for a wild new way to try to speed up boarding on planes — and as Ars Technica points out, it’s just like something out of the classic kids TV show Thunderbirds.

Here’s how it works.

On normal planes, passengers line up to board and shuffle in one at a time. It’s inefficient and pretty time-consuming.

The plane manufacturer Airbus thinks it has a new way of doing things — and it requires a revolution in plane design.

Airbus suggests detaching the passenger cabin altogether, instead loading passengers in a specially designed bay in the airport.

Once fully loaded, the plane can taxi into the bay, ready to receive its passengers.

The passengers can then be lowered into place — like an articulated truck, or a shipping container — and the plane is good to go.

Every minute spent idling on the tarmac is time wasted. The time freed up by not loading passengers directly could reduce turnaround time and allow planes to make more flights — making more money for the airlines.

As soon as the compartment is removed, a plane would be ready to make another flight, with no need to wait for cleaning or luggage unloading. It would also make it easy for any plane to carry freight cargo when required.

If it sounds familiar, that’s because it’s the same basic principle as Thunderbird 2 from the TV show Thunderbirds.

But don’t expect to see this in an airport near you anytime soon. This would be a massive undertaking, requiring a radical redesign not just of planes, but also airports.

But Airbus is clearly keen to be on the cutting edge of aircraft technology and is well known for creating hundreds of strange patents every year.

Earlier this year, Airbus was granted a patent for a way to fit more passengers into planes — by stacking them on top of one another.

In 2013, it was granted another space-saving patent. This one required passengers to perch on standing seats for the duration of their flights.

If this doesn’t sound too fun, then another Airbus patent has a solution that could alleviate your discomfort: virtual reality headsets for passengers.

ANALYSIS: The crucial decisions facing Airbus over A350 and A380 - Flightglobal,"Mon, 02 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYW5hbHlzaXMtdGhlLWNydWNpYWwtZGVjaXNpb25zLWZhY2luZy1haXJidXMtb3Zlci1hMzUwLWFuZC1hMzgwLzExODU2MS5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As Airbus begins assembly of its largest twinjet to date, the A350-1000, it faces a crucial decision about whether to add an even bigger version to its armoury to enable it to go head to head with the Boeing 777-9X.

Toulouse’s strategy in the “big-twin” sector is just one of the potentially life-changing decisions it is facing, as the time is coming for it to “put up or shut up” about a re-engined – and perhaps slightly larger – version of today’s A380-800.

Official details about both projects, dubbed “A350-1100” and “A380neo”, are sketchy, as is any official clarity on where Airbus is in its decision-making processes. It is also not clear whether a decision to launch one or other project is mutually exclusive.

When pushed, Airbus executives have spoken about both potential developments, but have generally played their cards close to their chests.

At last year’s Singapore air show, the manufacturer’s chief executive Fabrice Bregier left the door open to a competitive response to the General Electric GE9X-powered 777-9X, saying that while the -1000’s 360-passenger seat count was the “sweet spot” and there are “no short-term/mid-term plan to do [a stretch]... we could well envisage additional members of the A350 family”.

When launched, the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-powered A350 XWB was planned as a three-aircraft family with the -900 as the initial and baseline variant from which the -1000 stretch and -800 shrink were to be adapted. But as the A350 has proceeded through definition, the -1000 was redesigned to provide greater capability with a revised version of the Trent XWB offering more thrust than when the largest A350 variant was first envisaged. Meanwhile the -800 has effectively been abandoned in favour of re-engining the A330.

Qatar Airways is interested in an A350 stretch

Airbus

Speaking during this year’s Paris air show in June, Airbus’s chief operating officer for customers John Leahy said that the -900 was no longer the A350’s centre of reference, but that this middle point has “moved toward the -1000”.

Rather than a “double-stretch” strategy for a new development of the -1000 – about which Leahy has been sceptical – he said that a larger version of the -1000 might be closer to “one and a half”.

Leahy confirmed at Paris that work was underway to establish the level of demand for an larger variant, saying that Airbus must “be sure the market is asking for 40 more seats”. He has often stated Airbus’s view that the main driver behind Boeing’s decision to offer the 777-9X as a 400 seater (34 seats more than the A350-1000) is to allow it to offer competitive seat/mile costs.

Airbus is already working to raise capacity on the A350-900 and -1000 by up to 20 seats within the next five years. But Leahy said that the possibility of a development beyond the -1000 is a subject of early discussions with operators as well as internal analysis.

Also during Paris Airbus indicated that an A380 stretch was being floated to airlines in parallel with the proposed re-engining that would probably incorporate four additional fuselage frames – an extension of around 2.5m. Leahy said that such a “mini-stretch” would enable around three more seat rows in the economy-class cabin and one in business class.

Such an increase would raise seating by around 36-54 seats more seats to around 580-600, depending on the layout. This is considerably less than the previously proposed A380 growth variants – the original “A380-900”was envisaged as a 650 seater.

While no firm information is available on the likely powerplant for the re-engined and/or stretched A380, there is speculation that it could be based on the A350’s Trent XWB. This engine has already been flown on an A380, as one of Airbus’s development aircraft serves as a flying testbed for the engine.

According to Flightglobal’s Fleets Analzyer database, Airbus holds 169 firm orders for the A350-1000 from nine customers, with the first delivery – to Qatar Airways – due to take place in mid-2017. Meanwhile Boeing has racked up 243 orders from six customers since it formally launched the 777-9X at the 2013 Dubai air show with the backing of Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways. It also holds a further 53 orders for the shorter, longer-range -8X as well as for 10 where the variant has not been specified, putting total 777X orders at 306.

Although Airbus is vague about whether it will stretch the A350, others are more certain about the likelihood of such a development.

Qatar Airways – already launch customer for all the existing A350 variants - is interested in a stretch, but only if it offers enough of a step over the rival Boeing 777-9X. Chief executive Akbar Al Baker tells Flightglobal that he believes Airbus must develop a larger A350 to compete effectively with Boeing, and says his airline is a potential customer.

“We would be interested in a stretch of the A350-1000. Airbus has no alternative – to be competitive it will have to do something that is bigger and better than the 777-9X,” he says.

Airbus’s main rival also expects a competitive response and has taken such a development into consideration when developing the 777X, says Boeing’s marketing chief Randy Tinseth: “It’s hard for me to believe they wouldn’t do something. Because I don’t think they can live with being outsold four or five to one in that segment of the market.”

Tinseth adds that Boeing can handle any threat from Toulouse as it was “something we contemplated early in the process. We really like what we have with the -9. It really helps when you are out there with 300+ orders.”

Rob Morris, head of Flightglobal’s consultancy arm Ascend, believes the “A350-1100 could be an elegant way to plug the gap” in the Airbus product line between 350 and 550 seats. But Airbus might want to see the -1000 to fly, and maybe even the -9X, to have an idea of their relative weight and performance, he says.

“In real airline layouts, the A350-1000 will likely have 330-340 seats and the 777-9 370-400, giving it around 30-50 more seats,” says Morris. “Yet, the A350-1000, being an all-new design, may well be 30t lighter. So it’s entirely possible the two aircraft will be very close on seat-mile costs.”

Morris points out that Cathay Pacific has ordered both types, illustrating that the two types are complementary “and not all airlines or routes will need an aircraft of higher capacity than the 777-300ER”.

However he adds that if the 777-9X starts “cleaning up, then an A350-1100 could be Airbus’ reaction. But clearly it will be a challenge to deliver the ‘-1100’ with sufficient range to challenge the -9 on range with a further A350 stretch. So it must be careful not to end up with a compromised design that appears to offer a 350-400 seat solution but actually doesn’t deliver the payload/range performance airlines would require.”

Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Teal Group, believes it is only worth Airbus attempting an A350 stretch if “they can do a derivative that gets most of the way to the 777-9X level. I doubt they can, but it largely depends on Rolls-Royce. Or, if the Rolls exclusivity agreement [on the -1000] doesn't apply to a growth version, then it depends on the engine guys in general.”

Neither Airbus nor R-R will comment on the specifics of their A350-1000 powerplant agreement. Aboulafia wonders what ties GE has with Boeing on the 777X. “And would Pratt have any interest in a 105,000lb thrust engine? If it is Rolls, can they match GE?”

Qatar Airways’ Al Baker says the A350 stretch will need to incorporate “new engine technology” and doubts that the twinjet’s existing Trent XWB engine could be adapted for the larger variant as the powerplant “is already at its fullest” for the A350-1000.

Despite having a large commitment for the 777-9X, Al Baker can still see a role for a larger A350 in the Qatar Airways fleet, should it offer sufficient performance: “It would be bigger than the -9X and we believe it will have a superior fuel burn,” he says.

While Al Baker says he has no interest in a re-engined A380, this aircraft has long been the hobby horse of the ultra-large airliner’s biggest advocate – Emirates Airline president Sir Tim Clark. He’s been clear in his view that Airbus can create an outstanding “efficient seat-production machine” by bolting on some advanced technology engines and perhaps a slight stretch – Clark would have rather Airbus had built the larger “A380-900” variant in the first place.

Describing the current A380 as “the most profitable aircraft” in the Emirates fleet, Clark says the airline “could convert some” of the 50 Trent 900-powered A380s ordered in 2014 to the re-engined variant. He suggests that a combination of weight reduction, aerodynamic clean-up and a new engine could generate an economic improvement in the 10-13% range.

“If they manage to do that, the performance of the aircraft will be stellar,” says Clark. However he does not expect Airbus will launch an A380neo at the Dubai air show.

But whether or not it commits to a re-vamped A380, Airbus concedes it needs to start growing the A380 order book. Fleets Analyzer shows that of the 317 firm orders placed for the A380 to date, the backlog now stands at 146 aircraft – of which 73 are for Emirates.

Bregier, speaking at the Paris air show in June, suggested that the manufacturer might have “launched the A380 a bit early”, but said he believed that the market for an aircraft of its size was gradually emerging.

Richard Evans, who is senior consultant at Ascend, says the combination of sluggish sales along with deferred orders and some customers now unlikely to take delivery means Airbus has “limited options with the A380, and a neo may be the most palatable way to re-energise sales. The other would be to do nothing and perhaps allow the programme to wither on the vine.”

Evans says that timing-wise, the A380neo seems to fit: “After the A350-1000 development and entry into service in 2017, what is Airbus’s next project in the early 2020s?” he asks.

Teal’s Aboulafia sees the A380neo as “a great test for Airbus” and hopes and expects Toulouse will make the right call, which is to let the A380 die.

“If it walks away from the programme, Airbus has truly become a modern, free market company. If it launches the A380neo, it is still rooted in the vaguely embarrassing past, when politics determined programme launches and the company had little hope of determining its own future.”

Aboulafia says he likes how Airbus is run these days which gives him every confidence that the A380neo will be consigned to the “Museum of Seriously Bad Ideas”.

“So...would I choose the A380neo or a growth A350?” asks Aboulafia. “For me, it's the choice between a smart move and a decision to pull their neckties really tight until they choke. Not much of a choice.”

The elephant in the room for Airbus is what happens in the so called “middle of the market”, the sector where the 757 and 767 have existed and one that Boeing has been very publically evaluating for some time now. Airbus is confident it has the right product with the re-engined A321neo, but Boeing could respond with an all-new – and potentially radical – design.

Morris says that if the A350-1000 is able hold its own against the 777-9X and take “a decent share of the market – perhaps 50% in combination with the A380 - then Airbus’s attention could be more on the Middle of the Market space”.

Aboulafia says that if Boeing comes up with a competitive product in response to the A321neo and to satisfy the middle of the market requirement, then Toulouse will have to react: “Thus, another reason to let the A380neo die on the vine is that Airbus needs the resources to both defend the middle market and fight off the 777-9X challenge,” he says.

With so much to play for, and some crucial strategic moves still to crystalise, the civil manufacturing sector is entering a fascinating and potentially game-changing period. Watch this space!

Airbus Helicopters Photo

Two months after Airbus Helicopters introduced new hydraulic test procedures for AS350 helicopters, the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has made test procedure changes mandatory for operators of dual-hydraulic AS350 models.

The FAA issued an initial Emergency Airworthiness Directive (AD) on the subject on Oct. 28, 2015, and a revised version of the AD two days later. The revised AD, 2015-22-53, requires operators of dual-hydraulic AS350 helicopters to stop performing the yaw load compensator check during pre-takeoff procedures, and instead perform it after landing, following rotor shutdown. The AD also requires that the collective-mounted yaw servo hydraulic switch be in the “ON” (forward) position before takeoff.

According to the FAA, the AD was prompted by two accidents and one incident involving dual-hydraulic AS350 B3 helicopters. In each event, the aircraft experienced a counterclockwise rotational yaw immediately after takeoff. The pilots in the two nonfatal events reported that the anti-torque pedals felt jammed or locked in the neutral position, which is indicative of takeoff without hydraulic assistance to the tail rotor. This can occur if a pilot drains the yaw load compensator during pre-takeoff hydraulic checks, and then neglects to restore the collective-mounted yaw servo hydraulic switch to the “ON” position.

The problem has been recognized for some time. In August 2014, Airbus Helicopters issued a safety notice on the topic after receiving reports of pilots taking off with their collective-mounted yaw servo hydraulic switches in the “OFF” (aft) position. Airbus also introduced a modification (07.4622) for dual-hydraulic AS350 models, which provides pilots with a flashing caution light when the yaw servo hydraulic switch is turned “OFF”. However, relatively few AS350 operators undertook the retrofit in a timely fashion; one year later, at least two-thirds of the eligible aircraft in the U.S. fleet still lacked the modification.

On July 3, 2015, a Flight For Life AS350 B3e was involved in a fatal crash shortly after takeoff in Frisco, Colo. The survivors of that accident filed lawsuits against Airbus Helicopters and operator Air Methods Corp., contending that the aircraft took off without hydraulic assistance to the tail rotor. On Aug. 26, 2015, Airbus Helicopters announced new yaw load compensator functional check procedures for all AS350 models in the form of flight manual revisions. The revised procedures were immediately adopted by the European Aviation Safety Agency as an AD with an effective date of Aug. 31, 2015.

The FAA’s new, revised Emergency AD does not require adoption of the procedures as published by Airbus Helicopters. Instead, operators of dual-hydraulic AS350 helicopters may comply by inserting a copy of the AD into the rotorcraft flight manual, or by making specified pen-and-ink changes to procedures in the manual. The complete AD is available on the FAA website","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998984336853027}",neutral,0.9998984336853027,0

At AOPA’s request, aircraft purchase advisor Conklin & de Decker has estimated hourly operating costs for 45 jets likely to be at the National Business Aviation Association convention in Las Vegas. These are variable costs and include fuel, maintenance (parts and labor), engine reserves, auxiliary power units if applicable, and miscellaneous expenses to include crew travel, catering and cabin supplies, landing and parking fees—all boiled down to a single number.

David Wyndham, president and co-owner of Conklin & de Decker, made these comparisons.

As a quick summary, the least expensive to operate is a Cirrus Vision SF50 jet at $661.53 per hour. The most expensive, as you might expect, is a private airliner. The Airbus ACJ320 ultra-long-range, large-cabin business jet comes in at $7,964.69 per hour, while the Boeing BBJ 2 ultra-long-range, large-cabin business aircraft comes in at $7,674.95. A BBJ 3 is less expensive at $7,396.29.

The Eclipse comes in at $888.59, while a Gulfstream G650 is $4,843.16 per hour. Looking at additional manufacturers, an Embraer Lineage 1000E costs $5,827.32 per hour, while a Cessna Citation Mustang is $1,015.37. A Cessna Citation X+ is $4,098.69, while the new Cessna Latitude is $2,935.67. The Nextant 400XTi comes in at $1,623.06, and the SyberJet SJ30 at $1,607.77. A Dassault Falcon 8X costs $3,803.75 per hour while a Learjet 75 is $2,172.31, and a Bombardier Challenger 850 is $3,544.71. The Cessna Citation CJ4 is $1,970.13 per hour. Embraer’s Phenom 300 costs $1,757.53 per hour.

The company estimates that the HondaJet costs $1,134.90 per hour to operate.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999953508377075}",neutral,0.9999953508377075,0

"Materialise delivers 3D-printed, flight-ready parts for Airbus A350 XWB - PlasticsToday","Mon, 23 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBsYXN0aWNzdG9kYXkuY29tLzNkLXByaW50aW5nL21hdGVyaWFsaXNlLWRlbGl2ZXJzLTNkLXByaW50ZWQtZmxpZ2h0LXJlYWR5LXBhcnRzLWZvci1haXJidXMtYTM1MC14d2LSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Earlier this year, the Belgian additive manufacturing pioneer Materialise NV announced that it had successfully secured EN9100 and EASA 21G certification, thereby authorizing the company to deliver airworthy additive manufactured end-use parts. The company has now followed up that news with the announcement that their certified Factory for 3D printing is currently indeed manufacturing plastic parts for the Airbus A350 XWB.



A new generation of aircraft, the A350 XWB offers 25% lower fuel consumption, in addition to providing the highest standards of comfort to passengers. The latter is becoming ever more important as the frequency and length of long-haul flights continue to rise.



For its newest A350 XWB, Airbus has introduced a high level of intelligence through the integration of simple, robust and efficient state-of-the-art systems, which ensure reliability and lower maintenance requirements. And part of this innovation includes the use of a number of 3D-printed end-use parts of the A350 XWB are being 3D printed, a technology that, says Materialise, makes sense, especially in view of the benefits in terms of topology optimization and functional integration.



“Airbus understands and appreciates the benefits that 3D printing—or more appropriately in this case, Additive Manufacturing (AM)—can bring to the most modern widebody aircraft: the A350 XWB,” said Materialise Executive Vice President of Production, Bart Van der Schueren. “In addition, with one of the most thorough test programs developed for a jetliner, the use of AM end-use parts sends a strong signal about the reliability and quality that AM can deliver today.”



For 25 years, Materialise has been working to improve AM through an ever more sophisticated software offering, and a Factory for 3D Printing that manufactures parts that meet the needs of even the most demanding of industries, including the health care, automotive and aerospace sectors.



“As such, we are very proud to now be delivering end-use, flight-ready parts to Airbus,” said Van der Scheuren.

European leisure carrier is first to order 10-abreast Airbus A350 - Runway Girl Network,"Mon, 09 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTUvMTEvZXVyb3BlYW4tbGVpc3VyZS1jYXJyaWVyLWlzLWZpcnN0LXRvLW9yZGVyLTEwLWFicmVhc3QtYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airline adoption of ultra high-density economy class cabins shows no sign of abating with Airbus confirming to RGN that a European carrier has become the first operator to select a 10-abreast configuration for the Airbus A350 XWB. The news comes as Qatar Airways is mulling going 10-abreast on its A350s; the carrier is already in the midst of a densification program for its Boeing 777s.

Earlier this year, Airbus revealed it has been quietly working on a configuration that would enable airlines to offer a seat that will be just shy of 17″ width at 10-across. In an exchange with RGN contributor Jason Rabinowitz today at the Dubai Air Show, Airbus head of corporate & investor marketing customer affairs Mark Pearman-Wright said that the new product is officially “out there” and a “European leisure carrier” has ordered this configuration.

He declined to name the airline, but there was some speculation at the show that perhaps French holiday carrier Air Caraibes has potentially gone in this direction; its first A350-900s are scheduled for delivery next year and it already operates high-density A330s with seat width that is sub 17″.

In reference to A350 operator Qatar’s 10-abreast studies, Pearman-Wright said, “If you look at where their market is … you could perfectly understand a higher density configuration and we support that. We don’t think it’s there for everybody but it’s certainly there for an important part of the market.”

So how is Airbus adding an extra seat to the traditional 9-abreast A350 layout (which boasts 18”-wide seats)? “We are not changing the sidewalls; we are not changing the seat rails, so they’re already there and they’ve got the flexibility to take a 3-4-3 arrangement as opposed to 3-3-3. So the offering is a narrower seat. I hesitate to use the word less comfortable, but it will clearly be less comfortable,” said Pearman-Wright. He noted that this higher density offering “works in certain leisure markets or lower yield markets where comfort isn’t a driver; value is the driver. It will be a cheaper product.”

Even as it offers airlines the option to select sub 17”-wide seats for “high efficiency” cabin layouts (17″ is found on 9-abreast Boeing 787s, which get mixed #PaxEx reviews) Airbus continues to see 18” as standard seat width for economy. “So our standard product offering we call ‘comfort economy’, but … you know, the market is segmenting so you have got to be able to offer the variety of the product. So 90% of our economy class seats are comfort economy; 10% of them are there for budget economy size. 17” [is] 9-abreast on the A330, 10-abreast on an A350.”

Meanwhile, Airbus is honing its plan for the cabin interior of its forthcoming, re-engined A330neo. Cautious about not delaying the industrial ramp-up of its A350 by offering too much customization on the neo, Airbus is again taking a catalogue approach. “We have got the world’s largest airlines and within what they want, we are trying to get an agreement and try and standardize as much as possible. And my job, my day job is talking to the leasing and investor community. I have got a leasing background inside Airbus. That is something highly valued.”

To wit, Airbus has fine-tuned the galley arrangements on the A330neo. “The big difficulty you’ve got when transitioning from one airline to another airline, isn’t so much your supplier, it’s where you have got the galleys and the lavs and we can see from the thousands of [widebody] aircraft that we’ve delivered, where the galley [is at in] 80 percentile so we are focusing on the 80 percentile standard type of galley, lavatory arrangement that works and that is the way we will facilitate the configuration and certainly that will help the transitions [the] lessors will do later on.”

The double-decker Airbus A380 was notoriously delayed in part due to the high customization offered on the aircraft. But while A380 customers “expect the A380 to be the personification of the brand of the airline, that is a little bit of an industrial headache because you have to allow customization. By the time you get down into the twin-aisles the A350s and A330s, the airlines are quite happy to agree to much more standardization and they will see the benefit of that,” said Pearman-Wright.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999254941940308}",neutral,0.9999254941940308,0

The H215 is an evolution of the former AS332 C1e/L1e helicopter. Under the control of Airbus Helicopters Industries, the 10,000m² factory based in Brasov will house H215 production from procurement to after-sales, including design office activities, and will provide jobs to more than 300 employees in the long term. The first H215 to roll out of the assembly line is planned for 2017.

The airframer is investing EUR 50 million in the purpose-built, 10,000 sqm facility, which will be operated by a new company, Airbus Helicopters Industries. It has had a presence in the central European country since 2002, with Airbus Helicopters Romania (AHR) – a joint venture with state-owned aerospace company IAR – developing a successful maintenance, repair and overhaul business.

“This expanded partnership with Romania, an important EU and NATO member, will ensure that our legacy twin-engine heavy helicopters are more economical than ever on current and emerging markets,” Faury added.

From 2017, the production of the 8.6t maximum take-off weight helicopter will be progressively transferred from France to the new factory in Ghimbav, reaching full-rate production of 15-20 aircraft per year from 2019. Initial deliveries in 2017 will be confined to the short fuselage (C1e) model, with the 76cm-longer variant added from 2019.

The new entity is 100 percent owned by Airbus Helicopters, Serge Durand, managing director of Airbus Helicopters Industries said.

“We wanted to be in full control of our future,” Fabrice Arfi, Vice-President of Business Development Airbus Helicopters said in his turn. He believes it can achieve 30-35 percent Romanian content on the helicopter – including the value of labour – within five years. It is already working to secure its local supply chain, he says, with contracts to be signed next year.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998125433921814}",neutral,0.9998125433921814,0
Airbus A321: two crash versions - planet360.info,"Thu, 12 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBsYW5ldDM2MC5pbmZvL2VuL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzIxLXR3by1jcmFzaC12ZXJzaW9ucy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Last Friday, the Russian President Vladimir Putin suspended flights of Russian civil aircraft to Egypt. Russian tourists now cannot rest in this country as long as Egyptian authorities do not provide the necessary level of air travel safety.

On the night of November 7, Russian tourists arriving at the airports of their country to go to the resorts of Egypt received a special mark in their airline tickets. Tourists were asked to either return home or to travel to a more secure, according to tour operators, country – Turkey. The Head of the Department of Culture and Tourism of Antalya Ibrahim Acar has already said that his province was ready to take all the Russian tourists who want to replace holidays in Egypt on a trip to Turkey. According to him, there will be no problems with tourist accommodation in hotels.

Also, the Russian President instructed to provide support for citizens returning from Egypt. As of November 6, there were 45 thousand Russian tourists at the Egyptian resorts. In connection with the decision of the National Anti-Terrorist Committee of Russia, it will be carried out special flights, in addition to regular, to take out all the Russian tourists from Egypt in the short term. At the same time, transportation of passengers and baggage will be carried out separately. Tourists will be allowed to carry on board only the hand luggage, including baby food and essential drugs.

On November 4, the UK authorities began evacuating British tourists from Egypt. On November 6, British Airways made 29 flights from Sharm El Sheikh to take 20 thousand citizens from this country. The authorities of Ireland, France and Denmark also advised their citizens to refrain from trips to Egypt, especially in the area of the Sinai Peninsula.

For the first time the threat of international terrorism has caused such a large-scale action to prevent possible terrorist acts on the part of the first persons of different nationalities. Our world is changing, and it seems far from better…

On October 31, the Airbus A321 of the Russian company “Kogalymavia”, traveling from Sharm el Sheikh to St. Petersburg, crashed in the Sinai Peninsula. 224 people were killed –crew members and passengers of the aircraft.

Version 1: Is it still a terrorist attack?

On November 4, the British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond made a statement that according to the Government of his country, the crash of the Russian Airbus could cause an explosive device. This version was also pronounced by the Prime Minister David Cameron.

The US President Barack Obama supported the British Prime Minister in his interview to Radio KIRO / CBS: “I think that there is a possibility that a bomb was on board. And we take this very seriously.”

Both politicians made such conclusions based on the data of their security services. In particular, investigators of one of the British intelligence agencies believe that the cause of the disaster was the bomb planted in the luggage compartment shortly beforedeparture. They believe that some, as yet unknown, terrorist planted an explosive device in a bag and put it in the luggage compartment.

In addition, the British intelligence service GCHQ intercepted radio negotiations of Islamic terrorists with a British accent. According to The Telegraph, the jihadists “with experience in the field of electronics”, who trained in camps in Syria, could have participated in the manufacture of bombs that exploded in the Russian plane. In the conversation intercepted by the intelligence agencies, the Islamists “celebrated” the plane crash. However, all this information is not officially confirmed.

The French TV channel France 2, citing an anonymous investigator involved in the investigation of the crash, also said there was the possibility of a terrorist attack. As this channel reported, it could be clearly heard an explosion in recordings of black boxes from the wrecked airliner.

According to the Russian Interfax news service, an informed source in Cairo said that the black box recordings really contained “uncharacteristic and irregular flight sounds.”

So, how much is this version of the attack consistent? After all, international experts working in Egypt have not found its real confirmation yet.

Nevertheless, The Daily Telegraph offered to readers another “circumstantial evidence” in favor of the terrorist attack version. Dale Parker, the 47-year-old English tourist, told that once at the airport of Sharm el Sheikh, some people in uniform offered him some service for 20 pounds. For this modest sum they were able to bring him to the front desk for the flight, without going through examination of all the items of luggage.

“We have ignored metal detectors, security checkpoints, and bypassed all the queues. Then, he put my suitcase on the luggage belt, and I checked in. My luggage was never scanned. Now that I think about it, the story seems very strange to me,” says D.Parker.

The Guardian cited another witness, the BBC producer Wael Hussein. In his Twitter account, he wrote: “The airport staff urges Arab tourists for money to get a “quick service” and avoid the queues.” At the same time he published a photo on which one person hands money to another at the airport. According W. Hussein, he managed to photograph the bribe taken by the airport staff.

However, according to the Minister of Civil Aviation of Egypt Hussam Kamal, the investigators found no evidence of a terrorist attack.

Russian experts refrain from any preliminary findings. However, no obvious traces of explosives at the site of the wreckage have yet been found. As it has been known to the LifeNews, passengers that were in the tail of the aircraft at the time of the crash got explosive trauma with multiple burns. This, according to independent experts, was a result of the explosion of fuel tank, or the attack. Thus, it is too early to make the final verdict.

Experts took wipe-samples from the bodies of dead and all found parts of the Airbus. However, under the field conditions, the method of rapid analysis can provide data only on the long-known types of solid explosives. Today, terrorists learned to use liquid explosives from the household products. Therefore, the expertise materials will be studied for a very long time as the express-analysis cannot give reliable results.

According to Denis Dneprovsky, the former Head of the Group of Demining at Moscow Military Commandant’s Office, in this case, it could be used the so-called “clean bomb”. For instance, a small amount of explosive could create overpressure in the airplane. It led to depressurization of the aircraft, destruction of the fuselage, circuit wiring fault and an explosion of fuel.

An example of this is the terrorist attack of September 11, 1994, committed by Al Qaeda. At that time, the terrorist Ramzi Yousef blew up the aircraft using liquid explosives poured into a small container for contact lenses. It was the first terrorist attack in the history with the use of “chemically clean” liquid bomb. It is extremely difficult to detect its traces.

Any two bottles of liquid in a suitcase could be such a “clean liquid bomb”. Moreover, a brand new empty suitcase, filed with explosive gas is also the “clean bomb”. Suitcases are rather fast-moving goods in Egypt, and therefore are sold everywhere. The luggage examination staff may not even think to open the empty suitcase after checking it by x-ray.

Terrorists are now able to commit an attack even without the bomb. It is enough to have a computer at hand. One of the founders of One World Labs, an expert on computer security Chris Roberts, was able to hack into the electronic system of the Boeing 737 in the air. He easily changed the algorithm of one of the engines. Chris proved that sitting in the passenger seat you can enter the cockpit via the media system.

In other words, the version of the terrorist attack in the crash of the Russian airplane is quite consistent. Let us understand the problem – who is to profit from it?

The ISIS has already stated that the Russian plane crash was their handiwork. However, such statements are not worth trusting them, as there is a desire among many terrorists to take any accident to themselves, even if they are not involved in it.

Other destructive groups that want to destabilize the current situation in Egypt could commit the attack as well. One of the largest owners of hotel chains in Egypt, Al-Shair, said: “Direct losses due to the suspension of a number of flights and canceled hotels for the winter months are about 500 million dollars. According to our estimates, if the matter is not resolved within 4-5 days, Egypt will lose up to $ 2 billion for a year.”

In 2015, Egypt planned to take up to 10 million tourists from around the world. Total revenues were to reach $ 8 billion by the year end. Among tourists, who visit the country, the Russians were in the first place.

The revenue from tourism in Egypt is 11% of GDP.

Moreover, the close economic, political and cultural relations established between the two countries – Russia and Egypt – could also “mess” with some people very much.

However, we should not exclude yet another “crazy”, but very real version, which can be called in two words – a fatal mistake.

Version 2: Fatal Mistake

On November 7, The Daily Mail published a new sensation on the theme of the Russian plane collapse. On August 23, 2015, almost two months before the disaster, the British passenger plane with 189 passengers on board, flying over the Sinai, had a miraculous escape.

During military exercises, the Egyptian Air Force almost brought down a British passenger plane.

The crew of the Thomson airline aircraft saw a flying missile in time. The commander of a passenger plane immediately changed the flight path, having rejecting the airliner to the left. Only five crew members knew about the incident, and passengers remained ignorant.

The UK Department for Transport has confirmed the incident.

As it is known, on October 31, when a Russian Airbus A321 made its fateful flight from Sharm el Sheikh to Saint Petersburg over the Sinai, not far military exercises were held as well.

Since October 27,the air forces of US, Israel, Poland, and Greece carried out the air force exercises “Blue Flag largest in the history of Israel’s doctrine in the desert of Arabia for ten days.

If we look at a map, it is very close to the crash site of the Russian Airbus.

Earlier, Jeff Smith, the Science Editor of Veterans Today, a military expert, who served for many years in the Middle East and North Africa, assessed the situation as follows: “The cause of the accident could only be either a bomb on board, or Israeli missile Hawk and Patriot launched from the border.”

According to the Interstate Aviation Committee, the black box of the Russian Airbus A 321 does not contain any information about faults in units and the aircraft. “The on-board parametric recorder stopped recording in flight during climb to the 308 flight level (9400 meters). Up to this point the flight took place in normal mode, and no information about the failure of the aircraft systems and units has been registered,” said the IAC.

Examination and collection of wreckage scattered on the territory of 13 kilometers in length, continue. According to TASS, at the crash site, there was found the wreckage not related to the crashed plane. These fragments were sent for examination.

CBS reported earlier that the US reconnaissance satellite recorded a flash of heat on October 31 northern Sinai, but supposedly observed no trace of the rocket. The Pentagon later clarified that the satellite data was not necessarily indicative of an explosion, as at the time the military activity was observed in the area of the crash.

Unanswered Questions

Why do Barack Obama and David Cameron was so fast to make surprisingly loud-looking statements about the possibility of a terrorist attack on board the Russian aircraft without waiting for the conclusion of international experts? Why instead of not advertising, did not they submitting materials of their intelligence services to international experts and affected Russian side, as diplomacy logic dictates?

Why the British press is so insistent? Why, time after time, doe it publish information on unconfirmed reports and refer to circumstantial facts, creating a common information field, which allows only one conclusion on a terrorist attack?

What if international and the Russian experts insist on the version, contrary to the position of Barack Obama and David Cameron? Would these politicians take the arguments of the Russian side, or will ignore them?

Whom to believe, whom to blame for what has happened? Today, in our changed world we can only trust ourselves, carefully spelling out all the facts and asking the right questions. The only point – would we get the answers?

Jetman soars over Dubai in formation with Airbus A380 - New Atlas,"Sun, 08 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2pldG1hbi1kdWJhaS1haXJsaW5lci80MDI4MC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Daredevil Yves Rossy has never been afraid to think big when it comes to high-altitude stuntwork, but when it comes to wingmen, it doesn't come any bigger than this. ""Jetman"" has strapped on his set of kevlar wings and taken to the skies of Dubai to fly alongside the largest commercial aircraft there is, an Airbus A380 passenger jet.

In the video, Rossy and his sidekick Vince Reffet are dropped from a helicopter at an altitude of 5,500 ft (1,676 m) and join the enormous aircraft as it soars over the city at 4,000 ft (1,219 m). The low margin for error meant that the flight patterns were carefully choreographed for the sake of safety, but also to ensure the production team could get the shots needed to make a badass video.

""We will be mosquitos flying with an eagle or a condor,"" Rossy said ahead of the flight.

The low margin for error meant that the flight patterns were carefully choreographed

To keep pace with the aircraft and fly in formation, the duo had to push the small jetpack engines to their limits, meaning they could fly for no longer than 10 minutes at a time. With this small window to work in, the footage shows Rossy and Reffet in a series of tight holding patterns on either side of the plane before finally breaking away to (relative) safety.

You can watch this insane footage below, while the second video details some of the planning that went into the stunt.

Icelandic, a sister company to Icelandair and crewed by Icelandair, operated a Boeing 757-200 into the Union Glacier station last week, Nov. 17, on a proving run. The first passenger flight was yesterday. The 757 was configured for 52J/10Y seats; there were 50 passengers. The flight originated in Puntas Arenas, Chile.

The flight was operated for a group of companies that run a camp on the glacier for scientists, mountain climbers going for Antarctica’s highest mountain, Mt Vinson or going to the South Pole one way or another through Adventure Network International (ANI.). This is a trial operation that may lead to further flights in the coming year during the “Antarctic summer.”

ANI’s announcement is here.

The aircraft landed on a 10,000 ft blue ice runway. Ilyushin IL-76 aircraft have previously been serving the station.

This is the first (to our knowledge) operation by an airline, operating an off-the shelf airliner to Antarctica (RNZAF uses a 757-200 to McMurdo and Pegasus, Privatair has flown a BBJ to Troll, and Skytraders of Australia operate an A319CJ to Wilkins for the Australian Government). Icelandic’s 757 is Reg. # TF-FIN.

Icelandic/Icelandair has been preparing for the operation for seven months.

A Chinese narrow-body jet that can seat 168 passengers has now rolled off the assembly line, starting a new economic competition in the aviation industry between the Asian giant and the West.

It may seem like a small deal for some, but China’s new airliner is not just the first big passenger plane to “hit the road,” but represents the premiere of what should be the long-awaited birth to a transport industry. According to AFP , for the country, the plane represents at least seven years of efforts in a state-mandated drive to reduce dependence on European consortium Airbus and US-based Boeing.“China’s air transport industry cannot completely rely on imports. A great nation must have its own large commercial aircraft,” the country’s civil aviation chief Li Jiaxiang told an audience of government and industry officials. Sure, the 39-meter (127-foot) long plane may not be the famous Airbus A380, a large-double deck, wide-body, four-engine jet airliner that can provide seating for 525 people, but then again, that thing is the largest one in the world.“The rollout of the first C919 aircraft marks a significant milestone in the development of China’s first indigenous aircraft,” said Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) chairman Jin Zhuanglong. The Shanghai-based company’s official explains that the new airliner has a range of up to 5,555 kilometers (3,444 miles) and that it will make its first test flight next year.The new airliner may be China’s first big passenger aircraft to be domestically produced, but foreign companies are playing key roles in supplying systems. For instance, the engines are made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric (GE) of the US and France’s Safran.How many of these will reach the skies? Well, according to COMAC’s statement, already 517 were ordered, with most of them by domestic buyers. Thailand’s City Airways will get ten. However, the aircraft is still far away from being allowed to fly in US airspace, considering the Federal Aviation Administration’s certification. Moreover, delivering to customers will also take years, as industry officials don’t expect the plane to enter service anytime sooner than 2019.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998763799667358}",neutral,0.9998763799667358,0

Airbus patents removable aeroplane cabins for faster boarding - Dezeen,"Thu, 26 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlemVlbi5jb20vMjAxNS8xMS8yNi9haXJidXMtcGF0ZW50LXJlbW92YWJsZS1hZXJvcGxhbmUtY2FiaW5zLWFwcHJvdmVkLWZhc3Rlci1ib2FyZGluZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Plane manufacturer Airbus has continued its run of unusual patent filings, proposing a detachable passenger cabin designed to speed up embarkation.

Diagrams included in the document – which was approved by the United States and Patent Trademark Office on 24 November 2015 – show how a flat-bottomed cylindrical section of the cabin could be removed from the aeroplane.

Using a docking module, this would then be transported across the runway and to the airport for passengers to board. Once everyone is in their seats, the cabin would then be taken back to the aeroplane and slotted into place, ready for take off.

The patent document suggested that this could be used for passengers or freight, and said that ""immobilisation time of the aircraft"" could be reduced by boarding passengers onto a removable cabin.

""Transferring a payload in a commercial aeroplane requires that the aeroplane is immobilised on the ground,"" said the patent document.

Related story Airbus files patent for two-storey aeroplane passenger seating

""This is the case when boarding passengers, but also when loading their luggage, or again when loading freight. In addition, settling passengers in their respective seats in the aeroplane may lengthen the aeroplane's period of immobilisation.""

According to Airbus' document, long waiting times not only cost more, but increase flight times and fuel consumption. Separating the cabin would allow the aeroplane to undergo maintenance and checks while passengers board.

""In addition, the boarding method makes the presence of waiting rooms in the aircraft building superfluous, and thus makes possible substantial economies in terms of area,"" added the document.

It's the latest in a series of unusual patent filings by Airbus. In 2014 the company applied for a patent on bicycle-style seats that would replace seat cushions with saddles.

Another design filed by the company proposed two-storey passenger seating that would make the most of unused cabin space by stacking travellers one on top of another.

Other unusual proposals for aeroplanes include cabins that would be rendered ""see-through"" with flexible screens built into the fabric of the interior, and long-distance aircraft with wings that blend into its body.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999959468841553}",neutral,0.9999959468841553,0

The first plane produced by a Chinese government initiative to compete in the market for large passenger jetliners has been unveiled in Shanghai.

The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) showed off its twin-engine C919 in a ceremony on Monday attended by some 4,000 government officials and other guests at a hangar near the Pudong International Airport.

China’s aviation market is growing fast but relies on Boeing and Airbus aircraft.

The ruling Communist Party wants to claw back some of the commercial benefits that flow to foreign suppliers.

Dependence on Boeing and Airbus

For China, the plane represents at least seven years of efforts in a state-mandated drive to reduce dependence on European consortium Airbus and Boeing of the United States, and even compete against them.

“China’s air transport industry cannot completely rely on imports. A great nation must have its own large commercial aircraft,” the country’s civil aviation chief Li Jiaxiang told an audience of government and industry officials.

A small truck towed the 39-metre long plane – painted white with a green tail – out of a cavernous building decorated with an enormous Chinese flag into the sunlight as project workers marched alongside, an AFP news agency journalist saw.

“The roll out of the first C919 aircraft marks a significant milestone in the development of China’s first indigenous aircraft,” COMAC chairman Jin Zhuanglong told the ceremony.

The aircraft, which has a range of up to 5,555 kilometres, will make its first test flight in 2016, he said – meaning that it will miss the original deadline of this year.

The China Daily newspaper has reported the maiden voyage could even be put back to 2017.

China has dreamed of building its own civil aircraft since the 1970s when Jiang Qing, leader Mao Zedong’s wife and a member of the notorious “Gang of Four”, personally backed an attempt to do so. But the Y-10’s heavy weight made it impractical and only three were ever made.

Although the C919 is made in China, foreign firms are playing key roles by supplying systems as well as the engines, which are made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric (GE) of the US and France’s Safran.

Spending on the C919 has not been revealed. Last month, the Export-Import Bank of China said it would provide state-owned COMAC with $7.9bn in finance for its aircraft projects.

The company already has orders for 517 of its C919 planes, according to a COMAC statement, almost all of them from domestic buyers. Among foreign customers, Thailand’s City Airways has ordered 10, according to an announcement last month.

But it will take years for the C919 to be delivered to customers, with the plane expected to enter service in 2019 at the earliest, industry officials said.

“There’s a lot of work to do still,” said Briand Greer, president for Asia-Pacific of Honeywell Aerospace, which is supplying four key systems for the C919: flight control, wheels and brakes, auxiliary power units and navigation.

“A lot of testing, a lot of flight testing, systems integration testing and of course all the certification,” he told AFP.

COMAC has already developed a smaller regional jet, the ARJ, in a project which is years behind schedule.

Test flights

The 78-90 seat ARJ is still undergoing test flights and lacks the crucial certification by the US Federal Aviation Administration that would enable it to fly in US skies.

The Chinese company also plans a wide body plane, the C929, in cooperation with Russia’s United Aircraft Corp., and speculation is mounting China will create a new aero-engine entity to try to produce the powerful jets needed for large civil aircraft.

China is expected to add 6,330 new aircraft worth $950bn to its commercial fleet by 2034, Boeing stimates.

The single-aisle C919 targets the lucrative segment dominated by Boeing’s 737 and the Airbus A320.

“Research and manufacturing of a big plane is complex,” said China’s Vice Premier Ma Kai, the highest government leader attending the ceremony. “There is still a long way to go to commercial operation.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9946383833885193}",neutral,0.9946383833885193,0

Clark told reporters at the Dubai Airshow that Emirates has the option to convert the second half of its most recent order for current-generation A380s, which will be powered by Rolls-Royce, into the proposed A380neo, which could run on engines similar to those used on the Rolls-powered A350.

""We would like them to get on with it,"" Clark said, referring to the possible A380 upgrade, adding it did not necessarily need to be stretched despite recent reports that the double-decker could be enlarged to accommodate extra seats.

An A380neo could deliver 10-13 percent improved efficiency, he added.

Resemblance: The plane could be a real-life version of the beloved 1980s cartoon character, Jimbo (above)

Named after the beluga whale, the aircraft sparked excitement among both airline passengers and spotters as it landed in Manchester at 6.15pm yesterday to avoid the wrath of Storm Barney.

It drew further attention today as it took off from the airport at 2.50pm to return to its base.

The sighting of the plane - which had set off from Hamburg, Germany, earlier yesterday before it was diverted due to the weather - was incredibly rare, the Manchester Evening News reports.

The aircraft is a modified version of the standard A300-600 wide-body airliner which carries special cargo, such as plane parts, space station components, large artwork and industrial machinery.

At the time of its first flight in September 1994, it was officially called the Super Transporter.

However, the name Beluga quickly rose to prominence, and it was later officially adopted.

Rare: The sighting of the plane (above) - which had set off from Hamburg, Germany - was incredibly rare

The two-crew plane - which is part of a fleet of five Belugas - is based at Hawarden year-round.

It bears a close resemblance to the protagonist in Jimbo And The Jet-Set, who was a different size to other planes because his designer could not tell the difference between inches and centimetres.

The cartoon series follows the adventures of the talking plane and his airport vehicle friends.

Today, passengers and spotters were taking to social media to express their delight at having seen the bizarrely-shaped Airbus Beluga taking off from Manchester to return to its base, 50 miles away.

A man named Anthony Cassidy tweeted: 'I’ve just seen the Beluga aircraft at Manchester Airport. Very impressive!', while another user said they wished they had been present to see the plane.

The aircraft also landed in Manchester in October 2012 due to heavy fog near its base.

Take-off: The two-crew plane - which is part of a fleet of five Belugas - is based at Hawarden year-round

The Airbus Beluga is just over 184 feet in length, with a wingspan of 147 feet and one inch and a height of 56 feet and seven inches. It seats two crew members and can reach up to 624mph.

In 2004, the aircraft was used to transport relief to the Indian Ocean region following the devastating tsunami. And in 2005, it delivered aid and medical supplies to the U.S. after Hurricane Katrina.

A new version of the plane, dubbed the Beluga XL, is being developed by Airbus.

Based on the Airbus A330, it will replace the current type around 2020.

Airbus Transport International is a wholly owned subsidiary of Airbus Group.

The group hires out the Beluga fleet to third parties for charter flight.

Jetman Yves Rossy and Vince Reffet just took formation flying to a whole new level. Equipped with jetpacks, these two insanely brave men flew alongside the Emirates A380, the world’s largest passenger aircraft over Dubai.

The airplane flew at 4,000 feet and the men were deployed from a helicopter which was hovering above the aircraft at 5,500 feet. The duo flew on both sides of the airplane before joining each other on one side.

“When you first heard about it, it was madness, but then as we worked through the process and identified the risks and all the mitigations, it became more of a challenge and opportunity to show our skills,” said Gareth LIoyd Evans, Emirates’ flight operations manager.

“The highly successful demonstration by the C295W in Bolivia this week underlines again its excellent performance in hot and high conditions, which is key for several countries in the Region,” says Christophe Roux, head of Airbus Defence and Space in Latin America.

The aircraft was delivered in 2015, and since the navy order, all new C295s come standard with winglets.

Aside from the Mexican navy and air force, as of October 2015 Airbus has delivered C295s to Ecuador (3 aircraft), Colombia (6), Chile (3) and Brazil (12 of 15). ANX-1255 will return to Mexico next month, says Airbus.

Flying Economy on an Air France Airbus A319 - Airline Reporter,"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNS8xMS9ub3QtYmVzdC1haXItZnJhbmNlLWVjb25vbXktZmxpZ2h0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"We had purchased a Premium Economy fare to fly from San Francisco to Istanbul (IST) via Paris-Charles de Gaulle (CDG) with a 60-minute layover. While I was looking forward to checking out Air France’s medium-haul Premium Economy service from CDG-IST, the carrier quietly eliminated the class on everything but long-haul flights and placed passengers into regular Economy. Not nice.

Fast-forward to our landing at CDG — our inbound flight on the A380 was delayed taking off from SFO and spent its time circling the airport grounds, finally docking 45 minutes before our next flight. Would we make it in time, or would we have to spend four hours waiting for the next flight and losing an entire evening in Istanbul?

Airline: Air France (AF)

Aircraft: Airbus A319 (319) – 143 seats (variable up to 28 Business, at least 115 Economy)

Departed: Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG)

Arrived: Istanbul Ataturk Airport

Class: Economy

Seats: 7E, 7F

A Quick Background and Subtext

Booked as part of a Premium Economy (PE) fare from San Francisco to Istanbul, this second leg was operated by Air France from Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport. Air France, like many other European carriers, uses convertible seating that allows them to change the number of seats in the business cabin, based on actual booking; they just need to move the curtain divider and block the middle seats.

Back when the ticket was purchased, Air France offered PE on their medium-haul routes, such as CDG-IST. Benefits included Sky Priority access for checking in, boarding, and baggage handling, as well as a seat towards the front of the plane in front of the business class curtain (but no blocked middle seat) and a hot meal (the same as business class).

However, between time of purchase and time of flight, Air France very quietly eliminated PE service on all but their long-haul routes; affected passengers were rebooked into their Economy Flex fare, a reduction by all measures: no Sky Priority, no seat up front, no hot business class meal. Really, the only tangible benefit versus a lesser Economy fare was full points and miles earning.

Luckily, I had “Freccia Alata” status with SkyTeam partner Alitalia, which is considered SkyTeam Elite Plus and affords most of the airport premium services. Without this status, the story probably would have gone very differently.

Making the Transfer & At the Airport

After getting off our previous flight from San Francisco with only 45 minutes until departure, we rushed to the transfer area in hopes that we could get ahead of all the passengers who had just offloaded from our full A380. Fortunately, we had arrived into Terminal 2E, the same terminal as our onward flight to Istanbul. Following the signs to the international transfer area, we saw another welcome sight… a premium line for transfer security. We queued up there thanks to Sky Priority (and no thanks to Air France).

Because of our shortened connection time, we requested assistance from the airport staffer, working the line to see if she could get us to the front. She couldn’t care less, but most of the passengers took sympathy on us and let us skip ahead almost to the front of the line, where a family trying to make our same flight was also rushing to get through security.

After quickly getting through the checkpoint (with no TSA-type shenanigans), we threw on our packs and headed straight to our next departure gate, (no time to stop in the lounge) where we found our flight to Istanbul had been delayed, 15 minutes at first.

We took a moment to catch our breath, happy that we weren’t going to have to fight for overhead space.

Not sure if we were going to be served an actual meal, I walked around a bit to see what was available nearby: a Relay convenience kiosk, a coffee bar with pre-made sandwiches, a juice bar, and a duty-free store. Since nothing caught my attention, decided to roll the dice onboard and headed back to my wife, who was waiting in line (and didn’t mind standing after so many hours seated).

Our delays kept rolling until boarding was called at about 1:15 pm. A semi-mad scramble ensued, not to cut in front of others (though a couple of people attempted and were thwarted), but to be the first to join the back of the line. Down the jetbridge we went and into our Airbus A319.

Pro tip: If you can, grab a seat forward of the exit rows, as these should have a little more legroom.

On our flight, there were only three rows of business class configured; Row 7 was the last possible row of Business if configured to the max. That said, legroom felt standard by U.S.-standards and a little cramped. The seats farther aft had even less room. There were no seatback screens; in fact, no on-board entertainment at all, except for the in-flight magazine and looking out the windows.

Nor were there charging outlets, but a thin blanket was provided, which made my wife happy (since she got two of them, and I got none). I was fine though… I claimed both air vents.

It seemed to take a while to push back after boarding was complete. We sat close enough to get the WiFi signal from the terminal, so we didn’t mind at first. The door finally closed, and the flight attendants proceeded with their safety demonstration, in both French and English in real-time, then followed up by a recorded Turkish narration… no chic presentation or choreography here, just the basics of safety.

The demo ended as we were slowly… and I mean SLOWLY… taxiing to the end of the terminal to turn the corner. We stopped among a crowd of other planes waiting to take off, at least two lines of narrowbodies. The captain came on to the PA to explain that one of the runways at CDG had been closed, so our departure was held for an unspecified while. My wife dozed off, so I took the opportunity to snap some photos of the planes passing by us. It was a couple of planes first… then a few more… then they all just kept passing us while we sat still. At least I got some good shots…

We were kept in the virtual penalty box for a little over an hour before our engines roared back to life and we started heading for the runway, taking off almost immediately once we lined up. Once in the air, service started like normal and the seatbelt signs went off at 10,000 feet.

I could hear the clanking of chinaware from the business cabin, but one of the first things the crew did was to close the curtain, so there wasn’t much to see anymore. The Economy flight attendants came up with their trolleys to start serving from the front, with beverages first followed by the meal… no menu, no options, everyone got the same thing – but compared to flying in the U.S., I guess at least we got something.

I ordered a Coke, and was given a mini Coca-Cola can and a tiny cup with no ice. The next flight attendant handed us a long package holding most of our meal; the third gave us our “hot” item, a flatbread with cheese and tomato sauce inside a heatable plastic bag. If you grew up in the U.S. and ever had those rectangular pizzas in your school cafeteria, you’ll know what I’m talking about.

Inside the flimsy container was a very tangy curry coleslaw, cold bread, prepackaged brie, a lemon curd tart, utensils, and moist towelette. The big problem with the tray was no traction on the smooth tray table, so it slid down because of the angle of the plane… very annoying trying to eat with one hand while holding your food back with the other. The food was pretty subpar, so I didn’t try for too long.

Our food trays were collected, and I noticed that most of the food, especially the slaw, was largely untouched by the passengers. With about two and a half hours until arrival, I took a quick nap… my main form of entertainment.

Landing was uneventful, though I woke up in time to see that we were following the coastline into IST. We landed and arrived at the gate, delayed over an hour and a half, most of that time sitting in CDG. But we were in Istanbul, and our honeymoon adventures could finally begin…

NOT SO FAST! Because of our late arrival, we were in the midst of a large bank of arriving flights that overwhelmed the main immigration checkpoint. We had passed by a secondary checkpoint that was open, but the guard directed us away, letting only disabled passengers into that line.

Pro tip: At Istanbul Ataturk Airport, feel free to push and shove your way to establish your place in the immigration queue; then be prepared to watch (several) people walk by you to stand in line with their friends farther ahead.

We were in a very different world, where the strongest survive get ahead in line, and the weak just have to take it. There is a premium line here, but it’s reserved only for Turkish Airlines’ own premium and elite passengers, as well as Star Alliance Gold elites; everyone else had to scrum into the Turkish citizens line or the “everyone else” line (since Turkey is not part of the Schengen treaty, E.U. citizens have to use the general line).

Turkey requires a visa entrance fee for many visitors, including Americans (USD20, good for multiple entries within 90 days). Pay ahead of time online, and bring the printout with you. Worst case scenario, you can buy it online at the airport (which is in the process of eliminating “Visa on Arrival” purchases), but WiFi at the airport will require you to activate your cellular data to receive a code via text to give you 15 minutes of free access.

While our line had at least a few hundred people in it, most of the booths were staffed, the officers were efficient, and the line moved constantly. Still, we lost about 30 minutes getting through immigration, and by the time we were out, the baggage claim belt for our flight had already stopped. Since we had our packs with us, we just head out past customs, grab some cash at the ATM, and (actually) started our honeymoon in earnest…finally.

The Coulson Group of Canada has inked a memorandum of understanding with Airbus Defence and Space to work on the water bomber version of the Airbus C295W transport aircraft.

Under the agreement, Coulson will tailor its retardant dropping system to the C295W, switching the turboprop from a transport plane to a water bomber.

Two removable, 3,500 litre tanks will be built, with each tank capable of being filled with water or retardant in under seven minutes.

Coulson spokesman Britton Coulson says the upgrades will make the C295W a cost-effective firefighting aircraft that can easily be used for other duties when the fire season ends.

Coulson owns two massive Martin Mars water bombers, two C-130 Hercules aircraft and several powerful Sikorsky S-61 helicopters, and has a dependable record of supplying and maintaining large aircraft suitable for fire suppression.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999228715896606}",neutral,0.9999228715896606,0

MUSIC Demonstrates Laser DIRCM Capability - Defense Update,"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTUxMTIzX211c2ljX2MyOTUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The MUSIC family of Directed Infrared Countermeasure (DIRCM) systems was demonstrated recently at the annual, multinational EMBOW exercise held at the Bundeswehr WTD91 test site in Meppen, Germany last month. The annual exercise evaluates different capabilities to protect aircraft against Man Portable Air Defense missile threats (MANPADS).

The exercise is conducted under live and monitored and instrumented conditions, by the NATO 3rd NAFAG Air Capability Group SG/2, enabling pilots and engineers to evaluate the capability of aircraft and countermeasures to defeat infrared-guided surface-to-air missiles, from basic Manpads to more advanced surface to air short-range systems (SHORADS).

As part of the 2015 exercise the Israeli MUSIC DIRCM system was tested, utilizing an operational system integrated on an Airbus C295 aircraft, along with the Passive Airborne Warning System (PAWS) IR-based missile warning system, both systems are made by Elbit Systems.

During the tests, conducted by a multi-national NATO team, a C295 aircraft with an operationally installed EW self-protection suite successfully demonstrated the capability to detect, acquire, track and jam the trial test equipment on the ground, under extreme conditions. According to the system developers, the initial assessment of the results highlighted that the system has the capability to successfully jam MANPADS (infra- red, ground to air heat seeking Man-Portable Missiles) from the first, second and third generation, using generic NATO jam codes.

The demonstration was a joint project of Elbit Systems and Airbus Defence & Space (Spain). It was widely supported by the Israeli MoD, the Spanish Air Force and NAFAG ACG3 SG/2 (NATO Air Forces Armaments Group, Air Capability Group 3, Sub Group 2), which is the NATO group responsible for the development and validation of air platform protection solutions.

Elbit Systems’ MUSIC family of DIRCM systems integrate an advanced fiber laser technology together with a high rate thermal tracking camera and a small, highly dynamic mirror turret to provide effective, reliable and affordable protection to all types of aircraft and under all operational conditions.

The PAWS family of combat proven missile warning systems uses IR to reliably and rapidly detect the most advanced threats in all flight conditions.

Elbit Systems is currently under contract to supply more than 110 DIRCM systems to over ten customers, for installation on 20 different fixed and rotary-wing platform types.

The MUSIC family of DIRCMs have been extensively and successfully tested by various countries and are in full scale production for several NATO customers, including Germany and Italy.

Airbus Helicopters grows UK industrial presence - Professional Engineering,"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmltZWNoZS5vcmcvbmV3cy9uZXdzLWFydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLWdyb3dzLXVrLWluZHVzdHJpYWwtcHJlc2VuY2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Engineering news

Airbus Helicopters is to participate in government-led research projects for the first time, as it looks to increase its industrial presence in the UK.

The French-based maker of civilian and military rotorcraft will play a role in two separate projects: one supported by the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI) and the other through Advanced Manufacturing Supply Chain Initiative (AMSCI).

The £2 million ATI project will see Airbus working with Cranfield University, BHR Group and condition monitoring specialist Helitune to develop a tool to allow engineers to measure blade deformations during flight tests. The project will have a major impact on flight safety, operations and maintenance, and will contribute towards reductions in point-to-point travel time, said the partners.

The second project, worth £1.2 million and supported by the AMSCI, will see Airbus partner with project lead NetComposites under the Dual Use Technology Exploitation cluster to develop and produce lower weight, lower cost helicopter armour at an increased rate and enable more flexibility in military helicopter design. This project will help bring maturity to existing technologies, shortening the time to market from up to 15 years down to three, said Airbus.

Colin James, managing director for Airbus Helicopters in the UK, said: “Unlike the rest of Airbus Group which has a balance of core business activities spanning France, Germany, Spain and the UK, Airbus Helicopters still has, by comparison, an underdeveloped industrial presence in Britain and we mean to change this.”

Gary Elliott, chief executive officer of the ATI, added: “The UK blade research programme with Airbus Helicopters is a good example of how a major global prime can be attracted to locate its R&D in the UK because of the strength of our research centres, supply chain and the government’s support for innovation.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.987149178981781}",neutral,0.987149178981781,0

PARIS, Nov. 4 (UPI) -- Airbus Helicopters and Korea Aerospace Industries are to jointly market Korean light armed attack helicopters and light utility civilian helicopters globally. The marketing, which includes the offer of comprehensive after-sales support services, comes through a memorandum of understanding signed in the South Korean capital on Wednesday. Advertisement

""We have enjoyed great success in cooperation programs with Airbus Helicopters, with the Korean Utility Helicopter program being a prime example,"" said KAI's Senior Vice President and General Manager of Rotary Wing Aircraft Research & Development Dr. Joo Kyun Kim.

""Now as we look towards the future with our new LCH/LAH program, this collaboration is a natural next step that will enable both parties to leverage on each other's strengths, to ensure success of these platforms in Korea and the world.""

Details of the marketing effort are to be established in the months ahead by a joint working group.

""Korea is one of Airbus Helicopters' most important international customers, said Norbert Ducrot, Airbus Helicopters' Head of North Asia. ""Thanks to this MoU, we will build a strong and mutually-beneficial relationship with KAI in order to jointly market the LCH/LAH worldwide.""","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999998807907104}",positive,0.9999998807907104,1
With highest density A380 is Emirates dipping toe in Premium E? - Runway Girl Network,"Sun, 08 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTUvMTEvd2l0aC1oaWdoZXN0LWRlbnNpdHktYTM4MC1pcy1lbWlyYXRlcy1kaXBwaW5nLXRvZS1pbi1wcmVtaXVtLWUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Emirates is once again pushing the boundaries of commercial aviation with its 617-passenger Airbus A380, delivered this week and unveiled at the Dubai Air Show. Even with nearly 80 more passengers more than the 538 of previous A380 record holder Air France, Emirates’ high-density super jumbo isn’t even starting to approach the 853-passenger certification maximum for the A380. But Emirates’ new variation on the aircraft will bring challenges to airports — and especially to the airline’s premium positioning for its business class services. The high-density A380s will initially operate to Copenhagen and Bangkok, with Kuala Lumpur following in early 2016.

In terms of how the pieces fit together inside the high-density A380, Emirates has replaced the forward section of the upper deck — currently occupied by its first class suites — with 120 economy class seats in a 2-4-2 configuration, which is the standard for the A380 upper deck. In this layout, seats are pleasingly wide and very comfortable indeed.

The first class showers are gone as well, replaced by larger lavatories for the upstairs economy cabin. That cabin is starting to feel very premium, even if Emirates itself doesn’t call the section “premium economy”. While neither Emirates nor Qatar nor Etihad have premium economy plans, the location of this cabin, the opportunities for elite recognition, and the chances for ancillary revenue will give Emirates a head start if and when the first Gulf carrier moves.

To start with, window seat passengers have the benefit of a side bin for storage and as a surface to arrange their effects. Together with the two fewer passengers in each row, that makes the upper deck cabins a prime location, although most airlines’ upstairs economy is located to the rear of the cabin.

Some airlines choose to make this section a no-babies cabin, while others give priority seating in the area to frequent flyers or passengers flying on more expensive economy tickets. With none of the three Gulf carriers approaching premium economy, is this a way for Emirates to start to dip its toe into the lucrative waters of ancillary revenue and potentially even a premium economy cabin?

The airline has certainly gone big on the inflight entertainment, with markedly larger touch-sensitive screens, magnetic headphone jacks, AC power sockets, USB ports and a touchscreen remote control. These improvements are also seen throughout the downstairs main A380 cabin:

The 58-seater business class — down from 76 seats — fills the rest of the A380’s top floor, with Emirates’ bar at the back of the cabin as it is on the three-class A380. While the airline will clearly have thought through the option of moving business class forward for noise and prestige reasons, having the business class cabin in the same space throughout will be a smart move to ensure fleet commonality and save the need to change the inflight service rhythm in business.

Unfortunately, Emirates has not taken the opportunity to update the garish faux walnut throughout the business class cabin to a look that is more tasteful and modern. With remarkably restrained business class cabins unveiled onboard the A380s of competitors Etihad and Qatar Airways, this is a disappointingly missed opportunity.

Overall, though, the most likely downside of this aircraft will be the ground experience. It’s a rare airport where boarding 615 passengers isn’t chaotic, and while Dubai is one of the best facilities thanks to its all-A380 pier, the outstation airports where Emirates operates still have the heads of the queues at the same boarding gate on the same floor. Adding eighty passengers to the mix won’t help.

It’s unclear, too, what Emirates’ plans are for boarding the upper deck economy passengers. Options include boarding them with the main deck and expecting them to climb the interior stairs, which adds to the queueing time there, or boarding them with the upper deck and reducing the premium feel for business class passengers. The logistics of getting the economy level passengers in Dubai’s all-A380 terminal upstairs to the business class floor are also unclear.

Regardless, breaking through the barrier of six hundred seats on board a commercial airliner is no mean feat. Congratulations, Emirates.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9982545971870422}",neutral,0.9982545971870422,0
