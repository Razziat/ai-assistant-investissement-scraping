Boeing reported 962 gross orders placed so far in 2012, more than double Airbus' 437.

This is the first time in nearly a decade Boeing has taken the top spot: Airbus has come out ahead for nine consecutive years, according to Reuters.

For both companies, single aisle planes made up the vast majority of orders. Boeing claims its new 737 MAX, which accounted for 860 of its orders, is 13 percent more efficient than any other single-aisle airplane. That is a major selling point in an industry where high fuel costs keep profit margins slim.

Boeing also led Airbus in 2012 deliveries, helped by the 23 much-anticipated 787 Dreamliners it put in the hands of six airlines.

Airbus' single-aisle aircrafts accounted for 358 of its total orders. It secured only four orders for its enormous A380.

Airbus Ready to Start Assembly of New Composite Airliner - WIRED,"Mon, 22 Oct 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS8yMDEyLzEwL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLWZhY3Rvcnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Early tomorrow morning Airbus will officially open the assembly line for its new A350 XWB composite airliner. It's the company's Boeing 787 competitor, and you could almost hear the Jaws theme as Airbus rolled out the 33-foot-tall composite vertical tail.

The A350 XWB is the European consortium's answer to 787 Dreamliner. The Airbus is slightly larger, and like the Dreamliner, the A350 XWB uses composite materials extensively throughout the airplane. Though there is one major difference between the two aircraft: The 787 uses single-piece composite barrels that are joined together to form the fuselage, while the A350 uses composite panels attached to a metal skeleton to create the body.

Several sections of the A350 have already been fabricated including the fuselage, wings and tail. Some systems testing has also taken place, including the cockpit. With Airbus' opening the final assembly line in Toulouse, France tomorrow, the company still hopes the A350 XWB will enter service sometime in the second half of 2014. Though if history is any lesson, don't place any large bets on the date."

His formal title is Head of M and L Industrial Management and Control.

During the visit, several planes were in various phases of completion, and customers represented were France, Vietnam, Egypt and Kazakhstan. We got an update on the planes as well as on the new lean production approach.

SLD: The last time we were here – two years ago – the line was full of USCG Ocean Sentry aircraft. Could you describe what is here today?

Armas: Among other planes, you saw the fifth Vietnamese C-212. This plane is being final assembled from the main structural groups provided by our partner in Indonesia.

The plane represents a basic approach of Airbus Military, which is to grow footprint in Southeast Asia in the years ahead.

There are significant development opportunities in the region, but these opportunities require a significant industrial presence in the region as well.

So what we are doing with this plane is the main final assembly of the Vietnamese planes, but the rest of the groups and parts to be assembled are done in Indonesia.

SLD: There is a Kazakh C-295 being built on the final assembly line. This is the largest plane built on this line.

Could you describe this effort?

Armas: The plane you saw is the second Kazakh C-295. The first is currently being tested and we plan to deliver the plane in the coming weeks. It is going to be used for airlift purposes.

And we have just signed contracts with Oman for 8 of these planes, with three to be configured as Maritime Patrol Aircraft.

SLD: What about the Egyptian planes?

Armas: We have currently contracted for six C-295s with Egypt. We have delivered three and anticipate sending the 4th and 5th ones this year. We will send the 6th next year.

SLD: Finally, there are a couple of French aircraft on the line.

Armas: There are 2 French CN-235s being built now. These represent the 198th and 199th of this model series.

We expect to have an event in the first quarter of 2013 when we deliver the last of the French CN-235s, which will be the 200th model in the series.

And after that we are looking forward to another event for the 100th C-295. The Kazakh C-295 currently on the line is number 96. So 4 to go to get to the 100!

SLD: The last time we were here, the new approach to lean production was being started. How has it gone and with what impacts?

Armas: The approach has been a culture change, not only in terms of management working with blue-collar workers, but engineers working with blue-collar workers. The entire approach rests on significant improvements in communication so that problems get identified earlier and dealt with more effectively.

Not only do the industrialization issues become much clearer to deal with but clients see the process as well. Last week we had a core customer here and they could see what was happening with regard to a production issue posted on the walls of the assembly line. It is a VERY transparent process.

But it means that we don’t have to wait until the end of the process to change customer requirements but can build in a way to do this as we are producing the plane.

Best Seats: Delta Air Lines Airbus A319 - CNBC,"Fri, 19 Oct 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTIvMTAvMTkvYmVzdC1zZWF0cy1kZWx0YS1haXItbGluZXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzMTkuaHRtbNIBT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDEyLzEwLzE5L2Jlc3Qtc2VhdHMtZGVsdGEtYWlyLWxpbmVzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzE5Lmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Jack Harty

Delta Air Lines features a fleet of more than 50 narrow-body Airbus A319 aircraft that fly primarily short- to medium-haul flights in the U.S. Here's a rundown of the best and worst seats — part of an ongoing series on finding the best seats on various carriers. Delta acquired their fleet of Airbus A319 aircraft, when the carrier acquired Northwest Airlines in 2008. Delta ecently introduced an enhanced legroom section in coach that offers an additional three to four inches of space between rows. The new section is dubbed ""Economy Comfort."" (Read more: Delta Expands Enhanced Legroom 'Economy Comfort' Seating) All A319 aircraft offer 18 Economy Comfort seats, which comprise the first three rows of the aircraft, according to a Delta spokesperson.

First Class Any first class seat beats out one in economy, or course. They offer 36 inches of space, or pitch, between rows with a width of 21 inches. But there are some slight drawbacks to seats in rows one and three. While there is a cutout at the base of the bulkhead walls in row one, taller passengers still might find legroom restrictive. And seat recline in row three may be partially obstructed by the rear bulkhead wall in first class. Go for row two in first class. Update: received emails from a couple of readers who say the bulkhead behind row three is a soft divider allowing for full seat recline."

Airbus inaugurated a factory in France on Tuesday for its new long-range A350 aircraft, which will allow longer-distance direct flights. The new model should make its maiden flight by the summer of 2013.

European plane manufacturer Airbus said on Tuesday that its next-generation A350 passenger jet would take to the skies by the middle of next year and be commercialised by the spring of 2014 as the company inaugurated a new factory in south-western France.

Airbus Chief Executive Officer Fabrice Brégier told journalists gathered at the ribbon-cutting event in Toulouse that he was hopeful the A350 would be ready in time for the 2014 Paris Air Show at Bourget and that orders would begin to trickle in before then.

Built to compete against Boeings 787 Dreamliner, the A350 will be the first European airplane made from mainly lightweight carbon-composite materials, instead of aluminium, allowing for higher fuel-efficiency.

Three different models of the A350 will seat between 270 and 350 people.

Long-range profits

Airbus and Boeing say they expect total demand for mid-sized long-range aircrafts to surpass 6,000 units in the next 20 years, but have warned that neither the A350 nor the 787 will make a profit for years.

The next-generation carriers will allow airline companies to set up new routes that bypass today’s busy airport hubs.

The competing 787 went into service in Japan a year ago, but only after complications that delayed its first deliveries by three years. The A350 is already a year behind its originally scheduled delivery date.

Airbus is involved in disputes with the United States over subsidies and even one of its founder nations, Germany, over the funding for the A350, whose development is estimated at $15 billion.

Photos of the First Airbus A319 in Allegiant Air’s Livery - Airline Reporter,"Thu, 25 Oct 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMi8xMC9waG90b3Mtb2YtYWxsZWdpYW50LWFpcnMtZmlyc3QtYWlyYnVzLWEzMTktaW4tdGhlaXItbGl2ZXJ5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Earlier this year, Allegiant Air announced that they would be adding 19 Airbus A319s into their fleet. The one seen in this story was recently painted in United Kingdom Southend (SEN) and previously wore EasyJet colors. It currently shows registration number HB-JZK, but when put into service, this aircraft will most likely be wearing N301NV.

Their first A319 is scheduled to be delivered Q1 2013 and in operations Q2 2013. After it is delivered, the aircraft will be used for crew training.

BONUS: READ MORE ABOUT ALLEGIANT’S AIRBUS A319

Allegiant is configuring their A319’s in a high-density, 156 economy seat layout. The double exit doors over the wing shows that this aircraft is able to handle the 156 configuration (most A319’s with a single exit hold 134 seats).

One thing you might notice in all the photos is it doesn’t include the nose cone. I expect that is because the aircraft does not currently have a nose cone as seen on Skyliner-aviation.de. I am quite confident that it will have one soon.

I have to say that I love Allegiant’s livery. I think it looks best on the Boeing 757 and it is a bit squashed on the A319, but still looks slick.

Thanks Ken for the heads up!

Airbus Military explains cause of A330 boom detachment - Flightglobal,"Fri, 19 Oct 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLW1pbGl0YXJ5LWV4cGxhaW5zLWNhdXNlLW9mLWEzMzAtYm9vbS1kZXRhY2htZW50LzEwNzQ4My5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Military has identified the cause of an in-flight refuelling boom detachment that affected an A330 multirole tanker transport early last month, and says the incident was the result of a unique set of test circumstances.

The EADS-designed boom structure detached from the aircraft during a customer pre-acceptance flight on 10 September, before falling in a remote part of Spain from an altitude of 27,000ft (8,230m). No-one was injured in the incident, and the tanker - one of three destined for delivery to the United Arab Emirates - landed safely at Airbus Military's Getafe site near Madrid.

Airbus Military says a unique addition to the boom developed for the customer was being tested at the time of the incident. A back-up boom hoist intended to allow the structure to be retracted in the event of a failure to its primary system was being used, but its effects were unexpectedly countered by the main system until a failure and separation occurred. The set of circumstances being tested during the sortie could not have happened under normal operating conditions, the company notes, and procedures have been drawn up to prevent a repeat.

Airbus Military

Spain's INTA airworthiness authority is expected to soon lift a set of precautionary operating restrictions that was issued to other operators of the A330 boom system as a result of the mishap. These include Australia (file image of Royal Australian Air Force KC-30 above) and Saudi Arabia, neither of which selected a back-up hoist capability for their aircraft.

Meanwhile, discussions continue towards the agreement of a delivery schedule for the UAE's new tanker aircraft. The Gulf state had been due to accept its first two modified A330s in September and December 2012, according to a schedule released by Airbus Military during May.

Initial operational test and evaluation activities conducted with its first aircraft earlier this year included successful in-country boom contacts made with Lockheed Martin F-16 combat aircraft (below) and hose and drogue refuelling work with Dassault Mirage 2000 fighters.

Airbus Ramping Up Production A350 Production - Business Insider,"Mon, 22 Oct 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXJhbXBpbmctdXAtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1hMzUwLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tMjAxMi0xMNIBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXJhbXBpbmctdXAtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1hMzUwLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tMjAxMi0xMD9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The vertical tail plane of an A350, in Toulouse. Airbus

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus is looking at increasing planned production for the largest member of its A350 family to power its next important struggle with Boeing for a lucrative corner of the jet market, two people familiar with the matter said.

The plans emerge on the eve of Tuesday's inauguration in Toulouse, southwest France, of an assembly factory for the A350, which is being developed at an estimated cost of $15 billion.

The lightweight carbon-composite aircraft is Airbus's answer to two categories of Boeing long-haul jet: the 787 Dreamliner, which pioneered the large-scale of fuel-saving materials, and the more traditional metallic but still popular 365-seat 777.

The largest variant, the 350-seat A350-1000, will allow Airbus to compete directly with the twin-engined 777 ""mini-jumbo"". The duel is shaping as the next major aviation battle, with sales of up to 2,000 jets at stake over the next 20 years.

Airbus blames a shortage of delivery slots for slow sales of the A350-1000, which has notched up 88 orders and seen several cancellations since launch, though its U.S. rival claims Airbus was wrong to try to compete in two segments with one plane.

Raising production would free up more slots to be sold.

""Airbus is looking at ways of increasing A350-1000 production,"" a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.

It was not immediately clear whether this would be at the expense of production for the two smaller models of A350 or mean an increase in total production. There has been speculation the A350-800 could be scaled back to focus on larger models.

A spokeswoman for EADS subsidiary Airbus declined specific comment on production for the A350-1000, but said production for the overall series — officially known as the A350 XWB — was designed to accommodate changes in demand.

""The A350 XWB final assembly line is designed to be flexible and to be able to produce all three members of the A350 family (-800, -900, -1000),"" the spokeswoman said by email.

""We are working on a ramp-up to 10 per month to be reached four years after the first A350 XWB delivery and are constantly and closely following market trends so that we anticipate and adapt our production to meet our customers' needs.""

At first, Airbus will focus on production of the 314-seat A350-900, the best-selling of all three A350 models and one designed to compete head-to-head with the 787 Dreamliner, which entered regular service in Japan almost exactly a year ago.

Related stories

First flight is planned for mid-2013 and first delivery for the second half of the following year, suggesting the full production rate will be achieved in late 2018. The first A350-1000 is due in 2017 but it is sold out until late-decade.

MINI-JUMBO MATCH

Airbus is locked in a psychological battle with Boeing over the A350-1000, which was recently beefed up with a more powerful Rolls-Royce engine to improve payload and range.

Boeing produces seven 777s a month and plans to lift this to 8.3 after a record sales streak for the jet, which was extended by a $4.5 billion Turkish Airlines order on Monday.

But even the 777's industry fans acknowledge the 1990s metal design will eventually face headwinds from the A350-1000's lighter design, and Boeing has been toying for months with a 777 revamp that includes less thirsty engines and new wings.

While Boeing is under pressure from top buyers such as Emirates to firm up its plans for the 777X, as the tentative new version is known, Airbus is under pressure to score quick sales of the A350-1000 to recoup lost momentum. It says the plane offers significant savings over the current 777.

After a flurry when the A350 was launched in 2007, sales of the 350-seat A350-1000 went quiet until Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific placed a new order for 10 and upgraded orders for 16 of the smaller A350-900 model in July.

Industry analysts say that as well as pushing new sales, Airbus is actively trying to persuade buyers of its smaller A350-900 to trade up in pursuit of more payload and range, and a further rejigging of the order backlog cannot be ruled out.

On Tuesday, French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault will inaugurate the A350 plant in Toulouse in honor of one the European jetmaker's French founders amid a row over investment.

Germany is withholding half of an estimated 1.2 billion euro A350 development loan to voice unease over jobs.

The ceremony may also be held against a backdrop of fresh trade clashes with the United States, which wants to include the A350 in a long-running transatlantic subsidy dispute.

Washington has been studying European A350 data since last month and trade sources say it could give a response by Tuesday.

IN FOCUS: Airbus entrance reveals strengths and limitations of Wichita cluster - Flightglobal,"Tue, 30 Oct 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaW4tZm9jdXMtYWlyYnVzLWVudHJhbmNlLXJldmVhbHMtc3RyZW5ndGhzLWFuZC1saW1pdGF0aW9ucy1vZi13aWNoaXRhLWNsdXN0ZXIvMTA3NDg0LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus delivered a rather harsh message on 6 August to a Wichita aviation cluster that had been hoping for good news.

About 150 eager suppliers, who each spent $55 to attend an Airbus-hosted summit, could not be blamed for walking in feeling optimistic. They were, after all, being invited to discuss supplier opportunities by an airframer whose parent company has a stated goal of increasing its US economic footprint by 75% within eight years. Besides, Airbus is now a local company, having opened an engineering centre in downtown Wichita in 2002. But Airbus officials quickly doused the suppliers' expectations for making a quick sale directly to the world's largest commercial aircraft manufacturer.

Craig Hacker Airbus opened an engineering centre in Wichita in 2002

There is something like an ""Airbus Way"" to supplier management, and it does not involve direct relationships with the kinds of small companies that form the bedrock of the Wichita aviation cluster. Airbus is happy to deal with Spirit AeroSystems, but such a Tier One supplier is as far down the supply chain as it usually prefers to go.

""Every company goes about things a different way,"" says John O'Leary, vice-president of engineering at Airbus Americas. ""When we bring engineers in here they have to learn the Airbus way of doing the engineering and delivering the product. So can we go through that learning curve with companies? Yes, absolutely. Does it make sense with a Spirit AeroSystems? Yes, absolutely it does. Does it make sense with a mom-and-pop machining company? It's probably not worth it for that mom-and-pop machining company.""

It is a philosophy that Airbus applies all over the world. Even so, the strategy may be harder to accept in an aviation cluster such as Wichita, where such ""mom-and-pop"" suppliers were dealing directly with major aircraft makers for 40 years before Airbus even existed.

Whether directly or indirectly, the Wichita cluster still figures large in Airbus's corporate plan to embed itself industrially in one of the largest markets for its products. At the same time, Airbus's decisions illustrate both Wichita's unique selling points and its industrial limitations for any company thinking about moving into the cluster or expanding.

A key limitation for Wichita is, very simply, its geography. Land-locked and 274km (170 miles) by truck from the nearest port - the inland port of Catoosa - Wichita was quickly ruled out of Airbus's search for an A320 final assembly plant, which ended in Mobile, Alabama.

""It was purely geography,"" O'Leary says. ""Wichita wasn't even on the list because of geography.""

Wichita's lack of access to the sea was also the reason cited by Spirit AeroSystems for opening a factory in Kinston, North Carolina, to make parts for the Airbus A350XWB. Kinston's proximity to the coastal port of Newburn is also convenient for the future A320 factory in Mobile.

""You can have components [delivered] into Mobile. Then, the same barge can go [to Europe] through Newburn,"" O'Leary says.

INCREASING STRESS

Left unspoken is the near absence of industrial unions in the US southeast. Aircraft manufacture in the Wichita cluster has a long history of labour conflict. A truce seemed to arise between management and unions in the wake of the post-2007 downturn in the general aviation market. But there are signs of increasing stress in labour relations, with the International Association Machinists and Aerospace Workers voting to strike earlier this month against Bombardier Learjet.

However, Airbus's presence in Wichita is owed to the cluster's most attractive resource: a highly skilled workforce, steeped like few others in the unique culture and tribal knowledge of the aviation industry.

""I would say, on the positive side, it takes a certain mindset and a certain capability to build an airplane,"" O'Leary says. ""That knowledge, that capability, that culture exists in Wichita, Kansas, and in the supply chain that feeds whether it's Spirit or Cessna or Hawker Beech, that feed those OEMs.

The availability of that workforce, as a result of the post-2001 industry-wide downturn, is what brought Airbus to Wichita in 2002. O'Leary explains that the story actually begins in the mid-1990s, when Raytheon Corporate Jets moved the Hawker 1000 and 800XP from Arkansas to Wichita. The move brought several British engineers to Wichita, who then returned to the UK to support the Airbus A380 programme.

At the time, O'Leary was working for Raytheon, which is now Hawker Beechcraft.

""One of them called me some years after that and said: 'You know, we're going to establish an engineering centre in Old Town [Wichita]. Are you interested in joining us?',"" O'Leary recalls. ""I said: 'Yeah, sure.' And that's how I got started.""

The original plan called for simply opening an office in Wichita to recruit engineers to work in the UK, but there were few takers. Instead, Airbus decided to move its engineering databases to the Wichita cluster and establish the site as a hub for all of its engineering activity in the USA.

A staff of 27 in 2002 has grown to 350, with the head-count doubling in the last four years. The engineers work on aerostructures for virtually all of the Airbus commercial aircraft in production, with roughly 85% of the activity concentrated on wings, O'Leary says.

Ten years after starting to grow in Wichita, Airbus is now approaching the maximum capacity it intends for the site.

""I hope so,"" says O'Leary, ""because we've been growing like gangbusters. That begins to wear you out. We're at 350 [people]. If you walk around the building, you'd say, you probably have got room for 50 more. It's getting pretty tight.""

Airbus still plans to hire more engineers in the USA, but probably not nearly as many from the Wichita cluster.

""We have to venture outside Wichita,"" he says. ""We have to figure out how to use suppliers where those people are. Just in the sense that we didn't want to move to Europe, there's people in Greenville, South Carolina, or Dallas, Texas, that don't want to move.""

The aircraft will be immediately put into service across Emirates network of 126 destinations in 74 countries, supporting Emirates planned expansion of its network and flights.

The delivery of three wide-body aircraft in one day, a record for Emirates, required careful review and advance preparation within all operational units to ensure the availability of the required flight crew, cabin crew, engineers, airport staff in time to ensure a smooth entry into service.

“With its large capacity and excellent operating economics, the A380 is one of the pillars of Emirates’ future growth. Our A380s are specifically deployed on high-density routes where extra capacity is needed and have been well received by passengers,” said Adel Al-Redha, Emirates EVP-engineering and operations.

The jubilee Emirates A380 aircraft was handed over to the Emirates aircraft acceptance team by Michael Pflaum, Airbus Head of A380 delivery in Hamburg, during a delivery ceremony at the planemaker’s Jurgen Thomas A380 Delivery Center. With 25 A380 aircraft now in its fleet, growing to 31 by the end of 2012, Emirates is the largest A380 operator worldwide and with 90 jets on firm order by far the largest A380 customer.

The Dubai-based carrier was the first airline to order the A380 and thus enabled Airbus to proceed with the program.

“The delivery of our 25th A380 is an exciting moment for all of us at Emirates,” said Captain Abbas Shaban, Emirates’ chief pilot for the A380s."

BAE-EADS: Angela Merkel blamed for collapse of £28bn merger - The Guardian,"Thu, 11 Oct 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEyL29jdC8xMC9hbmdlbGEtbWVya2VsLWJhZS1lYWRzLW1lcmdlctIBTmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEyL29jdC8xMC9hbmdlbGEtbWVya2VsLWJhZS1lYWRzLW1lcmdlcg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The €35bn (£28bn) mega-merger between BAE Systems and EADS collapsed as a result of personal opposition from the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and despite a series of 11th-hour interventions from Downing Street officials and their counterparts in Paris and Berlin attempting to keep the deal alive.

The proposed combination of Britain's largest defence contractor and the Franco-German owner of Airbus would have created a pan-European manufacturing powerhouse with 220,000 employees, making hi-tech products ranging from nuclear submarines and Typhoon fighter jets to the A380 superjumbo. Sources close to the deal said Merkel had become the most significant obstacle to thrashing out an agreement, with No 10 officials participating in frantic high-level discussions on Tuesday night when it became clear that opposition from Germany was in danger of scuppering the deal.

""It [Merkel's opposition] was a key factor in the decision to terminate the talks,"" said the source. Another added that Merkel appeared to be ""philosophically opposed"" to combining a defence business with a civil aerospace company. ""The fundamental problem is that Merkel does not feel comfortable with the deal, full stop.""

The UK, French and German governments all had the power to veto the deal but Berlin's concern over the potential size of the French shareholding in the combined company, as well as disagreements over the location of the group's headquarters, proved to be the deal breaker that could not be resolved by the last-ditch round of phone diplomacy.

BAE's chief executive, Ian King, said failure to agree the size of French and German shareholdings was the key factor behind abandoning the deal , ahead of a 5pm deadline set by the UK Takeover Panel.

Declining to comment on Merkel's role, he indicated that Paris and Berlin would have to change their stance if the companies ever wanted to attempt a merger in the future. ""Unless European governments completely change their current view, we would not be in a position to resurrect the deal.""

BAE's chairman, Dick Olver, said the UK government had been ""incredibly helpful"" and denied that the failure to pull off the deal had now made BAE vulnerable as a takeover target for other overseas buyers – despite speculation that a US defence group such as Boeing or Lockheed Martin could now consider an approach for Britain's largest manufacturing employer.

The defence secretary, Philip Hammond, said the deal ""had to be done on the basis it was in Britain's national interest"" but the two companies had decided it was ""too difficult to progress this project further"". A source close to EADS said David Cameron had been ""really, really interested"" in the merger. ""There was a view that the British would be the biggest problem but that did not turn out to be the case.""

In a joint statement, the companies said they could not resolve state concerns about the deal, with the UK, French and German governments unable to reach agreement. ""It has become clear that the interests of the parties' government stakeholders cannot be adequately reconciled with each other or with the objectives that BAE Systems and EADS established for the merger,"" the statement said.

A person close to the negotiations added that while Germany had proved to be the biggest obstacle, there were still differences to resolve between France and the UK that had not been cleared by Tuesday night's flurry of calls, even if there had been more substantial progress between London and Paris. It is understood that every solution proposed drew an objection from one of the three governments.

France, which controlled 15% of EADS directly, was unhappy with German demands for the business to have its headquarters in Munich, while Germany was concerned that France could end up with a bigger shareholding in the new business than the 9% it was seeking.

The UK, in turn, refused to allow German and French political representatives to sit on the BAE board, as would have been likely under the dual-listed structure envisaged by both companies.

The UK's largest trade union, Unite, said a merger would have ""protected the UK's long-term interests"" if it had been accompanied by a jobs guarantee for British employees. BAE employs 37,500 people in the UK and is Britain's largest manufacturing employer.

Ian Waddell, a Unite official, said the UK government could secure such a guarantee in future mergers or takeovers by taking an equity stake in BAE. Although the British government has a ""golden share"" in the business, which can block a foreign takeover, it does not control a significant block of shares similar to France's stake in EADS. When their indirect and direct shareholdings are taken together, France and Germany each control 22.35% of EADS. ""It was an unequal negotiation with France and Germany,"" he said.

Ben Wallace, the Conservative MP for Wyre and Preston, who organised a petition against the deal signed by 45 MPs, said the deal should never have been promoted due to the threat of French and German political interference.

Wallace said the collapse of the merger put the future of BAE boss King, and his board colleagues, at risk. ""The BAE board should now reflect long and hard at what their strategic error could mean for the company's future. If they have put at risk my constituents' jobs and fatally wounded the UK's jewel in the manufacturing crown, then they should consider their position."""

And that involves a lot of training. To assist, BA are commissioning a simulator at Gatwick to allow its pilots to crosstrain as needed

British Airways have 12 Airbus A380’s on order, and will be operating 20 pilots to an aircraft – the idea being one set to be flying and roatated around as needed – and that means a lot of people will need to be trained. The airline is drawing primarily from its Airbus crews who are used to “flying by wire and stick” compared to the Boeing Crews who are used to control colour and yoke – this is advice from Qantas who are a long term operator of the A380 (and sometimes don’t take too much care over their big whales in the air either…)

For those pilots coming from a Boeing background, it is back to school for 6-7 weeks on the ground before going near a simulator. Then all pilots will need a month of both simulator and flight time.

And that brings us onto first operations. Whilst no long haul operation has been confirmed or denied – the city “Hong Kong” has been discussed more than once – short haul ops are guaranteed whilst the airline gets used to type with shuttle services to Madrid looking more than likely.

However, with 52 Boeing 747’s in service, it’ll be a hard decision where to stick them to get the load vs the yield needed to make these massive aircraft earn their living.

The idea being that BA can operate 4 sectors a day with the aircraft, and build up pilot time with it. Air France used this exact method of getting their crews up to speed with their A380’s (as did ANA when they launched the 787).

When British Airways A380’s enter service, it will the 3rd operator in Oneworld to operate the type. The others are of course Qantas and member-elect Malaysia Airlines.

Other operators of the A380 include:

For Star Alliance: Singapore Airlines, Lufthansa, Thai Airways International

For SkyTeam: Air France, Korean Air, China Southern,

Non Aligned: Emirates

Yes, it’s just another aircraft – a big one at that. Some of you I know want BA to buy the 747-8I (and the list of buyers for that is still pitifully small), but it is still one aircraft I’d like to try…

The competing 787 Dreamliner went into service in Japan a year ago after complications with a ground-breaking production system and global supply chain delayed its first deliveries by three years. Even before last week's inauguration, the 74,000-square metre Toulouse plant has been building the first A350 that will never fly but will be shaken apart in stress tests. Full production will now begin in earnest ahead of next year's maiden flight, rising to 10 planes a month by late 2018. MINI-JUMBO MATCH

Airbus is locked in a psychological battle with Boeing over the A350-1000, which was recently beefed up with a more powerful Rolls-Royce engine to improve payload and range. Boeing produces seven 777s a month and plans to lift this to 8.3 after a record sales streak for the jet, which was extended by a $US4.5 billion Turkish Airlines order on Monday. But even the 777's industry fans acknowledge the 1990s metal design will eventually face headwinds from the A350-1000's lighter design, and Boeing has been toying for months with a 777 revamp that includes less thirsty engines and new wings. While Boeing is under pressure from top buyers such as Emirates to firm up its plans for the 777X, as the tentative new version is known, Airbus is under pressure to score quick sales of the A350-1000 to recoup lost momentum. It says the plane offers significant savings over the current 777. After a flurry when the A350 was launched in 2007, sales of the 350-seat A350-1000 went quiet until Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific placed a new order for 10 and upgraded orders for 16 of the smaller A350-900 model in July."

Airbus to double US spending in coming years - SKNVibes.com,"Fri, 19 Oct 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNrbnZpYmVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ld3NkZXRhaWxzLmNmbS82NDgzMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Washington, USA) - European aircraft maker Airbus said Friday it plans to double its annual spending with US companies to some $24 billion in the coming years and would seek new supplier partnerships in Southern California.

The announcement marked a new step in the US market, after Airbus announced in July plans to build its first aircraft assembly plant in the country in Mobile, Alabama, in home-turf competition with US rival Boeing.

Backed by a strong global order backlog of more than 4,400 aircraft and growing future demand, ""Airbus plans to double its current $12 billion annual spending with US manufacturers in the coming years,"" the company said in a statement.

Airbus said it currently spends more than $1 billion in the Southern California region, and that last year's spending went to more than 400 manufacturers and service suppliers in more than 40 US states.

The European aircraft manufacturer, based in Toulouse, France, highlighted that its US spending was equal to supporting 210,000 American jobs, calculated by a US Commerce Department formula.

""Hundreds of American companies, with hundreds of thousands of jobs, are supported through Airbus's partnership with the US, and with our commitment to expand, we believe those numbers will increase in the coming years,"" said Airbus Americas chairman Allan McArtor.

McArtor made the announcement at an educational summit in Los Angeles attended by 100 local manufacturers and focused on attracting new supplier companies for Airbus, said Airbus, a unit of the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company.

""This effort by Airbus to increase partnerships with local manufacturers is a win for local manufacturers, a win for job seekers and a win for the aerospace industry,"" said Gary Toebben, head of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce.

""The potential growth of the aviation industry brings great hope to Southern California at a critical time for the region, as we slowly recover from the economic downturn,"" Toebben said.

In July, Airbus announced a new $600 million assembly plant, to be built in the southern port city of Mobile, Alabama on the Gulf of Mexico, to produce its popular A320 passenger planes.

Airbus estimates more than 4,000 new single-aisle aircraft will be needed in the United States over the next 20 years and that the new US plant could more than double its current roughly 20 percent share of the huge US aircraft market."

BA has a dozen superjumbos on order, with the first due to arrive in July followed by three more before the year is out.

The British flag-carrier has shortlisted Hong Kong, Singapore, New York and Beijing as the A380s first destinations.

BA chairman Sir Martin Broughton is now tipping Hong Kong will take the honour, giving Australian travellers an appealing option when making their Kangaroo Route hop via Hong Kong with the help of a Qantas connecting flight.

(If you choose the right day of the week you can do the Red Roo's A380 on QF127/128 and then double up on the double decker with BA.)

""It's not confirmed but my guess is it would be Hong Kong, although Madrid will probably be the test flight"" Broughton reportedly told Business Traveller.

""People keep saying New York, but remember we have the schedules there, so the bigger the aircraft, you reduce the schedule.""

As Australian Business Traveller revealed last week, British Airways won't be fitting an all-new Club World business class seat to the A380, opting instead for what a spokesperson described as ""an evolution of the current seat"".

We spotted and snapped BA's first A380 on the line during a recent visit to the Airbus factory in Toulouse, however the airline is yet to reveal the seating plan for its new flagship.

It will of course encompass all four classes, from World Traveller economy and World Traveller Plus premium economy through to Club World business class and of course BA's lush First cabin.

The layout is tipped to place first class, business and economy on the lower deck, with secondary business and economy cabins plus a compact premium economy section upstairs.

Emirates welcomes 25th Airbus A380 to its Fleet - Khaleej Times,"Wed, 03 Oct 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtoYWxlZWp0aW1lcy5jb20vYXZpYXRpb24vZW1pcmF0ZXMtd2VsY29tZXMtMjV0aC1haXJidXMtYTM4MC10by1pdHMtZmxlZXTSAVtodHRwczovL3d3dy5raGFsZWVqdGltZXMuY29tL2F2aWF0aW9uL2VtaXJhdGVzLXdlbGNvbWVzLTI1dGgtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtdG8taXRzLWZsZWV0P2FtcD0x?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Emirates welcomes 25th Airbus A380 to its Fleet

DUBAI -- Emirates, took delivery of its 24th and 25th Airbus A380 and its 78th Boeing 777-300 on Tuesday.

By (Wam) Follow us on







Published: Wed 3 Oct 2012, 5:24 PM Last updated: Tue 7 Apr 2015, 11:08 AM

The aircraft will be immediately engaged into service across Emirates network of 126 destinations in 74 countries; supporting Emirates planned expansion of its network and flights. The delivery of three wide-body aircraft in one day, a record for Emirates, required careful review and advance preparation within all operational units to ensure the availability of the required flight crew, cabin crew, engineers, airport staff in time to ensure a smooth entry into service.

“With its large capacity and excellent operating economics, the A380 is one of the pillars of Emirates’ future growth. Our A380s are specifically deployed on high density routes where extra capacity is needed and have been well-received by passengers,” said Adel al Redha, Emirates Executive Vice-President of Engineering and Operations. “Similarly, as the world’s largest 777 operator and the only airline in the world to operate every model in the Boeing 777 family, including the 777 Freighter, our Boeings provides reliability, performance and the operating economics Emirates requires to support our ambitious and strategic growth plans. Both the aircraft types exemplify our commitment to operating a modern fleet for the benefit of our passengers.”

The jubilee Emirates A380 aircraft was handed over to the Emirates aircraft acceptance team by Michael Pflaum, Airbus Head of A380 delivery in Hamburg, during a delivery ceremony at the planemaker’s Jurgen Thomas A380 Delivery Centre. With 25 A380 aircraft now in its fleet, growing to 31 by the end of 2012, Emirates is the largest A380 operator worldwide and with 90 jets on firm order by far the largest A380 customer. The Dubai-based carrier was the first airline to order the A380 and thus enabled Airbus to proceed with the programme. The further 65 A380s on Emirates’ order book is part of Emirates’ overall 216 aircraft still to be delivered; worth US62 billion.

“The delivery of our 25th A380 is an exciting moment for all of us at Emirates. We were the first airline to place a firm order and played a key role in the design and the performance qualities of the aircraft. With now 25 jets in our fleet, we are most experienced A380 customer,” said Captain Abbas Shaban, Emirates’ Chief Pilot for the A380s. “The Emirates A380 truly is an unrivalled flying experience and the double-decker is extremely popular with our passengers. We have redefined air travel with amazing features such as an on-board lounge and shower spa making our flagship probably the most talked about aircraft in the world today.”

“We are extremely proud to be handing over to Emirates their 25th A380,” said John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer, Customers. “With its growing fleet of A380s, Emirates has raised the bar for the industry in terms of passenger comfort and economic efficiency. Operating at some of the world’s busiest airports, Emirates A380s are proving day in, day out not just how good the aircraft is at reducing congestion but also how quiet and environmentally friendly it is.”

Amongst its 186 aircraft in operation, Emirates has the world’s largest fleet of A380s which currently serve Amsterdam, Auckland, Bangkok, Beijing, Hong Kong, Jeddah, Kuala Lumpur, London Heathrow, Manchester, Munich, New York JFK, Paris, Rome, Seoul, Shanghai, Sydney, Tokyo and Toronto. Melbourne today joins the A380 network and Moscow and Singapore will receive Emirates A380 service in December. In early 2013, Emirates will expand operations at Dubai in the world’s first exclusive A380 terminal, Concourse A, at Dubai International Airport."
Review: Thai Airways Airbus A380 Royal Silk business class seats - Executive Traveller,"Tue, 09 Oct 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vcmV2aWV3LXRoYWktYWlyd2F5cy1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1yb3lhbC1zaWxrLWJ1c2luZXNzLWNsYXNzLXNlYXRz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Australian Business Traveller was invited onto the debut flight of Thai Airways' first Airbus A380, and we've got the world’s first review of Thai's all-new Royal Silk business class seats – packed with photos and need-to-know notes for the business traveller.

Business class in Thai’s A380 is predictably located on the upper deck, and bookended by first class at the pointy end and a small economy section at the rear.

There are two business class cabins: the larger contains 48 seats over 12 rows (11 through 23 – like most airlines, the triskaidekaphobic Thai skips row 13), with 12 more seats in a secondary cabin further back (rows 25 through 27).

To make the most of its new flagship, Thai Airways chose the highly-regarded Solstys seat from EADS Sogerma and adopted a space-efficient staggered 1-2-1 layout which gives every passenger direct access to the aisle so there’s no climbing out or being climbed over.

We’ve set out the specs before: each of the business class benches is 20.9 inches wide with a seat pitch of 43-44 inches.

Eagle-eyed travellers will spot the 'three-point' seatbelt where the sash comes down from your shoulder as well as fastering 'low and tight' across your waist.

The cushions and padding are firm and supportive rather than that plush sink-into-it feeling.

The armrests are well positioned, although in the window seat I found my elbow was uncomfortably nestled against the rising part of the seat’s shell.

Window seats are angled are slightly towards the view, although there’s not the steep rake of Cathay Pacific’s business class.

Personal space

We love the trend towards boosting the personal space around business class seats, and Thai hasn’t settled for some token cocktail table.

This shelf's got more room than the fold-down tables in most economy seats.

It’s especially handy when you’ve finished your meal and want to quickly get back to work – just shift the dinner tray from your main table off to the side.

The window seats deliver an insane amount of usable space because you also have the benefit of those bins under the window.

I was juggling a lot of kit during my long flight – laptop, headphones, camera, tablet, associated cables and assorted paperwork – and never once fell short of space.

The coathook keeps your coat handy during a flight, but I found doing so cluttered up the space around my knees.

Another small but significant consideration in the Solstys seats is the sensible placement of the headphone and AC sockets.

Every traveller has been on a flight where you first of all have to hunt around just to find these ports, and then bend and squirm in your seat to insert the plug.

In these seats the headphone jack is adjacent to the handheld controller for the in-flight entertainment system.

The AC socket for your laptop is located further down the same panel so it’s both easy to see and easy to reach.

The tray table which folds down from the wall of the seat module is large enough to comfortably fit the largest laptop.

It doesn’t come down quite close enough to the passenger, however, so you’ll need to slide your seat forward a few inches for eating or typing.

A pivoting hinge on the arm swings the table back towards the video screen so you can more easily side in and out of the seat without folding the table up.

There’s not a huge amount of storage around the seat itself (we still reckon Cathay Pacific’s business class takes the gold medal in this category).

The nook under the armrest is best suited for small personal items – a pair of reading glasses, a smartphone or iPod, a book or your Kindle, or stowing your noise-cancelling headphones when not in use.

Large tablets like the iPad aren’t a neat fit, although smaller 7 inch models like the Google Nexus should slide right in.

The AC socket is handy if you want to plug i your smartphone for an en-route recharge and leave it sitting in that hidey-hole.

But if you use one of the USB ports for that purpose you’ll need to leave the cable dangling and the device sitting on the footrest shelf.

Each seat in Thai’s A380 business class gets a large 15.4 inch touchscreen monitor fixed to the rear of the seat shell in front.

But you won’t need the long reach of a Harlem Globetrotter as there’s a conventional controller tucked into the armrest.

Each business class seat also gets two USB ports for charging smartphones and tablets during the flight.

Sadly, the capabilities for using a USB key plugged in either of these ports is severely limited.

There’s no support for video files, so you can forget about BYO movies or TV shows (including that latest episode you downloaded from the lounge just before your flight). All you get is music (in MP3 format), photos and PDF files.

Even then, the system works only with USB keys formatted using the Windows-based FAT32 system, and FAT32 in turn recognises only 2GB partitions. Insert a 4GB or 8GB key into the slot and the system simply won’t ‘see’ it, nor play any of the content stored on that drive.

The snooze test

Each seat has a deep and decidedly snooze-inducing recline, and goes all the way down to a fully 180 degree lie-flat bed.

If you’re looking at that photo and thinking it doesn’t seem completely flat, but is on a slightest of slopes, you’re right – the seat is 3 degrees off the horizontal.

Aircraft are slightly angled during flight, even what we think of as ‘level flight’.

Sogerma’s seat-design boffins take this into account and assume that angle of incidence to be - you guessed it - 3 degrees.

On the ground you’d be lying in a bed that’s ever so slightly sloping. But in flight, the seat’s 3 degree offset compensates for the plane's own tilt so that you’re lying fully flat.

But will you be fully comfortable, especially if you’re fully stretched out?

That will depend on how tall you are.

I’m close to 180cm (5’11”), and lying flat on my back I could feel the top of the seat around my head, but inching down had my feet touching the base of the shell.

Some travellers may also find recess which their feet tuck into could also be a tight fit.

Sleeping on my side and with a bit of a bend wasn’t an issue but I wouldn’t want to be a traveller who tops the 6 foot mark.

In both the window and middle seats, lying on my back with arms crossed over my chest, I found one elbow always wedged into the crevice between the armrest and storage nook, while the other sat against the armrest.

The seatbelt fixtures can also get in the way.

Moving to an aisle seat was less constraining, as one elbow was free to jut out slightly into the aisle, although not so much that it would be bumped by passers-by.

Which Thai A380 business class seat is for you?

Not all seats in Thai’s A380 business class are created equally.

The staggered layout has the physical location of each seat alternating from one row to the next.

In row 14, for example, the seat is next to the window, with a shelf between you and the aisle.

In row 15, however, your seat is directly at the aisle – and the side shelf is now located between you and the window.

Under that shelf and inside the shell of the S-shaped seat lies the footwell of the seat behind you.

This neat dovetail layout means that the lower part of the seat-bed for the aisle passenger in row 15 is located under the shelf of the window passenger in row 14.

(Don’t wrinkle your nose in fear of unsavoury foot fragrances wafting your way: the seats are fully enclosed.)

Decoding Thai’s A380 Royal Silk business class seat numbers

That unique layout means that seat numbering differs from the norm – and understanding how the seats are numbered is vital to getting the type of seat you want.

Thai tags the window seats as A and K, with the aisle seats as B and J.

Because the location of the seat alternatives from row to row, the seat numbers mimic this pattern.

The first set of true ‘window’ seats are 12A and 12K. This is followed by aisle seats 14B and 14J (as noted earlier, Thai skips row 13).

That pattern continues through the cabin: 15AK, 16BJ, 17AK, 18BJ and so forth, through to the final row of 24BJ.

The pairs of seats in the centre of the A380 have a similar variation, except that instead of window-aisle they’re middle-aisle.

One row has the seats right next to each another.

Each seat still has a side shelf, but they're located next to the aisle.

On Thai’s seating chart these two-together pairs are allocated seat numbers E and F, and called ‘middles’. French seat manufacturer Sogerma more romantically refers to these as ‘honeymoon seats’.

By that same measure, every other row in the centre of Thai's A380 business class cabin might be dubbed ‘divorce seats'.

Each seat in this row is situated on the aisle, with their shelving in the middle, so the seats are noticeably separate.

These carry seat numbers D and G, and are also kown as ‘aisles’.

The first row of centre seats in Thai's A380 business class cabin is 11D and 11G – they're aisle seats where you don’t need to interact with your seatmate.

The second row are the ‘honeymoon seats’ of 12E and 12F, where it’s harder to ignore your seatmate.

This continues through the cabin as 14DG, 15EF, 16DG and so on, down to the final row of 23EF.

The last three rows of business class in the A380’s smaller rearward cabin are arrayed 25 A-D-G-K (window, aisle, aisle, window); 26 B-E-F-J (aisle, middle, middle and aisle); and 27 A-D-G-K (window, aisle, aisle, window).

As we said earlier, knowing how Thai’s A380 seat numbering scheme works means you have the best chance of choosing a seat that suits your style and needs and even your comfort.

That’s because the staggered layout creates three different business class seat ‘environments’ on Thai’s Airbus A380: window (tagged A and K), aisle (B and J, D and G) and middle (E and F).

Window seats: A, K

Snaring a window seat on Thai's A380 isn’t just about the view.

You have a much greater sense of privacy because you’re physically separated from the aisle.

Being a little further away from the aisle’s associated foot-traffic can also make for less disturbance if you’re a light sleeper.

Window seats are also storage central. The bins built into the sides of the A380 are right next to you (and you get two of those), so it’s easy to stow and retrieve items during the flight, and use the top of the bins as extra shelf space.

You can also wedge your laptop or other small carry-on bag between the sidewall and the shell of the seat in front of you, for handy access during the flight.

The upshot of all this is that you can keep clutter around your feat and seat to a minimum, yet still have everything you need within easy reach.

This creates the ideal environment for turning a long flight into a productive work session.

However, there’s a whopping great caveat to Thai’s A380 window seats.

Mind the gap...

The gap between your side shelf and the rear of the seat shell in front of you is barely 30cm (12 inches).

That’s a tight squeeze for anybody who’s not on the slim’n’trim side.

There's even less room when you allow for the sizeable hinge for the tray table (which is housed on the seat shell), or have your jacket dangling from the hanger, plus the need to step gingerly if your laptop’s power brick is plugged into the AC socket.

It’s especially problematic if you decide to leave your seat while you’re using the tray table.

The natural thing to do is to push this pivoting table away from you – but that leaves the table fastening clip (mounted on the seat shell) exposed, jutting out a over an inch from the wall and likely to snag your clothing as you attempt to squeeze by.

So as much as we love the window seat, especially for solid in-flight work sessions, we suggest this as your seat of choice only if you’re of a slim build and don’t plan to get up much during the flight.

Aisle seats: B and J

As you’d expect, the B and J business class seats on Thai’s A380 are much easier to get in and out of compared to their window-hugging AK cousins.

However, the proximity to the aisle could leave you feeling more ‘exposed’ and more aware of traffic.

You’ll also need to crane your neck around to check the view out the window.

While you still get to claim two of the under-window bins, they won’t be within reach – so they’re best used for storage all the way through the flight, rather than fishing around for items mid-flight.

Aisle seats: D and G

These seats are next to the aisle but in the A380’s middle block. The main difference between them and their closer-to-the-window counterparts is that you won’t have access to the under-window bins.

If you travel lightly and can keep most of your in-flight items tucked away in the overhead bin, this won’t be an issue.

Middle seats: E and F

Thai’s ‘honeymoon seats’ are clearly the first choice if you’re travelling with a partner or a close colleague because you’ll be sharing almost every moment of the journey.

On the other hand, solo flyers – and that’s the majority of business travellers – will want to avoid E/F allocations to reduce the risk of being stuck next to a garrulous passenger.

If you're travelling in business class on the plane, we've got the latest in our series of expert Best Seats guides to making sure your journey is as productive or restful as possible.

The business class cabin

You'll find 38 angled lie-flat business class seats set out in a 2-2-2 configuration, in two cabins: rows 1-5 in the front cabin and 15-16 in the rear.

SAA's business class seat is a roomy 23.6 inches (60 cm) in width, with 73 inches (185 cm) of seat pitch in each row.

The best seats on the plane

1K 1A 15A 15K: if you're a window fan, these are the seats to go for, in this order. The bulkhead in front of you means that you have more space to pick your way across the aisle passenger. However, note that there is a small galley kitchen in front of 1K and lavatories in front of 1A, 15A and 15K. Note that all these seats are bassinet positions for babies, so you may be moved (or disturbed) as a result.

3D 3G: aisle fans and anyone who really wants to get some undisturbed sleep should pick this row, as far as you can get from flushing loos, banging kitchens and squalling kids, and with nobody picking their way over you in the night.

2D 2G 4D 4G: a second-best set for aisle fans, these centre pairs are still some way from sources of noise, with direct access to the aisle.

D & G seats: as a rule, these are best to pick if you're trying to get some sleep: nobody picking their way over you.

The worst seats on the plane

1D 1C 15C 15D 15G 15H: watch out for these aisle seats, which are right next to the lavatories: ripe for increased traffic and disturbance.

Row 16: right in front of economy (and no fewer than four bassinet crib positions for infants), this is likely to be the noisiest spot in business. Avoid.

Row 5: some passengers like being cocooned between the closets on either side, but others report that there's galley noise from behind and that the crew are often in and out of the closets. Choose with caution.

C & H seats: there's no reason for aisle fans to choose these seats, since there'll be a window passenger climbing over them. Pick a D or G seat instead.

These are the obligatory glossy PR pictures, of course – we've snapped our own very detailed 'real life' shots of the seats and cabin when we joined a handful of invited media on the A380's delivery flight from Airbus HQ in Toulouse, France to Bangkok.

Thai will be flying the Airbus A380 to Hong Kong, Singapore, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Osaka, Paris, Sydney and possibly London – click here for the dates and details.

Thai Airways A380 Royal First Class

At the front of Thai's A380 upper deck are the 12 mini-suites of Royal First Class.

Thai Airways president Piyasvasti Amranand says this design was chosen over fully-enclosed private suites because ""our survey with passengers shows that more than half prefer partially closed suites, not something completely closed"".

Each seat is 26.5 inches wide with an 83 inch pitch, and boasts a 23 inch flat screen TV.

We're glad that an airline has exercised restraint in the outfitting of its suites: no brashly gilded opulence here, just the refined luxury of a clean and modern cream-white palette.

The centre suites have a movable divider, so if you're travelling with a (very well-paid) colleague or someone else you fancy talking to during the flight, you can raise and lower it at your convenience.

Naturally there's plenty of stowage space for the many personal inflight items which we all seem to be toting these days.

Our press pack didn't include many pics we hoped for, such as the lounge area at the very front of the upper deck, but you can bet we'll take some photos of this when we fly the A380 back to Bangkok.

Until then, here are some images snapped from Thai's own promotional video of the A380 cabin mock-ups.

The lounge area located in front of first class has convertible multi-purpose seating.

There's a three-seater table that can be slotted into place -- perfect for a meeting or dining together.

Those seats also convert into a pair of two-seater sofas.

If you need something to wet your whistle, there's a fully stocked first class bar en route.

The lavatories are spacious too, with a separate dressing table for changing into your stylish yet comfortable in-flight wear.

Thai Airways A380 Royal Silk business class

Stretched along most of the upper deck is the Royal Silk business class cabin.

The 60 seats are arranged in a staggered 1-2-1 layout.

This is probably the best business class layout in the skies: everyone has direct access to the aisle, with nobody crawling over you in the middle of the night while you're trying to get some sleep.

And speaking of sleep...

With 20 inches seat width, a 180 degree lie-flat design and wrap-around privacy screen, these seats should be among the best for getting a sound snooze in the sky.

When you're not flat out, there's an ample 74 inch pitch and a generously-proportioned table.

There's also a 15 inch video screen.

Thai has plumped for seats from EADS Sogerma, who also make the seats for Etihad's staggered business class layout.

Each seat has its own side table, with the feet of the passenger behind tucking underneath the side table belonging to the passenger in front.

Even if they're not as swish as the first class lavatories, Thai's business class loos are also a step up from the norm. (We assume they actually come with doors, though.)

Thai Airways A380 economy class

The entire lower deck is given over to 377 economy seats, with 58 more slotted in at the rear of the upper deck behind business class (we expect this will become the economy cabin of choice).

Each economy seat is 18 inches wide, in the usual 3-4-3 configuration with a 32 inch seat pitch.

You also get a 10.6 inch screen plus, we're happy to say, an AC power outlet for every seat.

We'll bring you more photos plus a full report on Thai's A380 first, business and economy class seats next week.

BAE-EADS deal: What it could mean for the Airbus factory site in Broughton - This is Money,"Thu, 04 Oct 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoaXNpc21vbmV5LmNvLnVrL21vbmV5L21hcmtldHMvYXJ0aWNsZS0yMjEzMDUxL0JBRS1FQURTLWRlYWwtV2hhdC1tZWFuLUFpcmJ1cy1mYWN0b3J5LXNpdGUtQnJvdWdodG9uLmh0bWzSAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGlzaXNtb25leS5jby51ay9tb25leS9tYXJrZXRzL2FydGljbGUtMjIxMzA1MS9hbXAvQkFFLUVBRFMtZGVhbC1XaGF0LW1lYW4tQWlyYnVzLWZhY3Rvcnktc2l0ZS1Ccm91Z2h0b24uaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BAE-EADS deal: What it could mean for the Airbus factory site in Broughton

Pride, enthusiasm and confidence. Three words which amply encapsulate the atmosphere at the giant Airbus factory site in Broughton, North Wales.



While the executives of parent company EADS, the European aerospace consortium, are locked in controversial merger talks with British rival BAE Systems, the ordinary workers are getting on with the same job that’s been done here for more than 70 years, albeit using bang up to date technology and materials.



Broughton has always been a centre of aerospace excellence. The factory started life in the 1930s as the Second World War was looming. Wellington bombers were assembled here until 1945 – they even turned one out in just 24 hours as an example of what could be achieved.



Aerospace excellence: The Airbus factory started life in the 1930s as the Second World War was looming

Even today the original headquarters building remains in use, with the oak panelled boardroom preserved as a nod to the company’s illustrious ancestry.



De Havilland acquired the site in 1948 and made everything from Chipmunk trainers to the latest contemporary jets such as Comet airliners and Vampire fighters before it became part of British Aerospace in the 1970s. There are even remnants of the camouflage paint that helped disguise the factory from the Luftwaffe.

These days, the factory can churn out a wing for the giant A380 aircraft every four days thanks to awe-inspiring automatic riveting machines four storeys high.

Wings for all Airbus’ civilian aircraft are made here before being shipped to other sites in Europe, including Toulouse and Bremen. A380 wings are so big they can only be moved by sea and when ready they are taken on giant transporters onto barges on the River Dee before switching to roll-on, roll-off ferries.



Such feats are commonplace at Airbus but the sheer size of the West factory where A380 wings are made is difficult to comprehend. But the people are even more impressive than the buildings and processes.









Discussing the future with several bright Airbus apprentices reveals the drive of these youngsters to forge a career in a sector they are certain has a prosperous future. They are studying for NVQs and degrees, gaining valuable hands-on experience on the shop floor while learning the theory behind their craft.



Cameron McKay, 19, from The Wirral, says: ‘You get a real sense of achieving something worthwhile here.’ He takes pride in calling himself an aeronautical engineer and says he would one day like to move into management. He has every chance. Around 70 per cent of managers at Broughton started as apprentices.



Fleur O’Hagan, 21, from Halkyn, Flintshire, says: ‘Aircraft are exciting. There is always something to look forward to.’ O’Hagan is learning French because she knows speaking a language could open doors during her future career, including opportunities to work in factories across the EADS group.



Hannah Evans, 20, from nearby Saltney, applied to join the Royal Navy but opted to work at Airbus because she was able to start work sooner than a military career would have allowed.

All the apprentices talk of how they deliberately chose not to go to university. They were concerned about burdening themselves with debt, living in poor quality accommodation and the fear of being unable to find a job once they had finished studying.



While incredibly aware of what’s going on in their chosen professions, they seem oblivious to the proposed merger between their employer and BAE Systems and what it could mean for them.



It is not a topic openly discussed on the shop floor and they exude confidence when they say they are not worried about job security. It’s a view bolstered by those at the very top of the company.



Speaking when the new site was opened last October, EADS chief executive Tom Enders said there was nobody in France or Germany who could do what was being done at Broughton, in Britain.

It is hard to imagine Airbus dismantling such a vast, expensive and modern factory and shipping the jobs to Europe. There are so many orders for Airbus aircraft in the pipeline – 1,400 last year – that there is seven years of work lined up.



Paul McKinlay, head of the Broughton plant, says he is confident if Airbus joins BAE Systems the deal will merely provide fresh opportunities for growth."
