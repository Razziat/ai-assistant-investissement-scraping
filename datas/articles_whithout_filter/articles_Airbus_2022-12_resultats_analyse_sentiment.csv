Remote Carrier demonstrator released and operated from flying A400M for the first time - Airbus,"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0xMi1yZW1vdGUtY2Fycmllci1kZW1vbnN0cmF0b3ItcmVsZWFzZWQtYW5kLW9wZXJhdGVkLWZyb20tZmx5aW5nLWE0MDBt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Madrid, 12 December 2022 – Germany’s Bundeswehr, Airbus, the German Aerospace Center DLR, and German companies SFL and Geradts have jointly carried out the world’s first successful launch and operation of a Remote Carrier flight test demonstrator from a flying A400M. Multiplying the force and extending the range of unmanned systems will be one of the future roles of Airbus’ military transport aircraft in the Future Combat Air System (FCAS).

“The excellent collaboration with our German customer and partners on the A400M UAV Launcher campaign is further evidence of how the development of FCAS will take innovation and technologies to the next level,” said Airbus Defence and Space CEO Michael Schoellhorn. “FCAS as a system of systems is starting to take shape now.” The device for launching Remote Carriers from a flying A400M was developed in just six months. For the test flight, it was loaded onto the ramp of a Bundeswehr A400M, from which the Remote Carrier demonstrator, a modified Airbus Do-DT25 drone, was launched. After the release, the Do-DT25’s engines were started and it continued in powered flight mode. The crew on board the A400M then handed over control to an operator on the ground, who safely commanded and landed the drone.

Remote Carriers will be an important component of FCAS. They will fly in close cooperation with manned aircraft and support pilots in their tasks and missions. Military transport aircraft such as the A400M will play an important role: as motherships, they will bring the Remote Carriers as close as possible to their areas of operation before releasing up to 50 small or up to 12 heavy Remote Carriers. These will then join manned aircraft, operating with a high degree of automation although always under a pilot’s control.

Getting the A400M UAV Launcher ready for testing

To get the A400M UAV Launcher ready for the test campaign, Airbus, the Bundeswehr Technical Centre for Aircraft and Aeronautical Equipment (WTD 61), DLR, SFL and Geradts applied new ways of working such as rapid prototyping and a joint flight testing approach. This enabled the multidisciplinary team to develop and integrate the system, bringing it into the needed systems-of-systems context in a very short time, ready for flight testing. Throughout the development, this flexible industrial setup and new collaborative ways of working were supported by the German procurement office, BAAINBw.

Today, CERN and Airbus UpNext, a wholly owned subsidiary of Airbus, have launched an innovative collaboration to explore the potential use of superconducting technologies developed by CERN for particle accelerators in the electrical distribution systems of future hydrogen-powered aircraft.

Superconducting technologies could drastically reduce the weight of next-generation aircraft and increase their efficiency.

The partnership focuses on the development of a demonstrator known as SCALE (Super-Conductors for Aviation with Low Emissions), bringing together CERN’s expertise in superconducting technologies with Airbus UpNext’s capabilities in innovative aircraft design and manufacturing.

If the expected performances and reliability objectives are achieved, the collaboration could reach the ambitious target of flying a fully integrated prototype within the next decade.

“In its research, CERN pushes back the limits of science and engineering, and partners with industry to enable innovation, with a positive impact on the environment,” said Raphaël Bello, CERN’s Director of Finance and Human Resources. “Our technologies have the potential to be adapted to the needs of future clean transportation and mobility solutions, as this agreement with Airbus demonstrates. This partnership is only a first step in our journey with the European leader in aviation, and shows how much we value the excellence of our Member States’ industry.”

“Our role at Airbus UpNext is to explore the full potential of technologies for future aircraft and to partner with the world’s leaders to prepare for this future. Partnering with a leading research institute like CERN, which has brought the world some of the most important findings in fundamental physics, will help to push the boundaries of research in clean aerospace as we work to make sustainable aviation a reality”, said Sandra Bour-Schaeffer, CEO of Airbus UpNext. “We are already developing a superconductivity demonstrator called ASCEND (Advanced Superconducting and Cryogenic Experimental powertraiN Demonstrator) to study the feasibility of this technology for electrically powered and hybrid aircraft. Combining knowledge obtained from our demonstrator and CERN’s unique capabilities in the field of superconductors makes for a natural partnership.”

“Superconducting technologies have fuelled some of the greatest discoveries in high-energy physics and, if applied to aircraft power distribution systems, would drastically reduce their weight and increase their efficiency. CERN has over 40 years of expertise in building world-record superconducting systems that are at the core of existing and next-generation particle accelerators. Such systems present negligible resistance to the flow of current, thus transmitting much higher intensities than traditional, heavier, non-superconducting cables,” said José Miguel Jimenez, Head of the Technology department at CERN.

There is virtually no public information about eAction outside Airbus itself, though the company has trademarked the name and a recent job posting puts the previously unreported effort in the same breath as its ZeroE program. While not earmarked for any specific program or aircraft, said an Airbus spokesman, eAction is described by the company as “an internal working name for a bundle of research and technology bricks that we are studying to make our aircraft more efficient” with a focus on materials, aerodynamics and propulsion.

Related: X-Wing comes to light as major new Airbus demonstrator program

Airbus’s recent two-day summit on future sustainability was long on building blocks for future advanced propulsion technologies that could produce air travel without emissions (more than a decade away), yet short on near and medium-term advances that could continue to incrementally reduce CO2.

While the mathematical reality of incremental changes won’t produce carbon-free flying, the coming years of record planned production of Airbus single-aisle jets mean changes to its existing slate of aircraft can — in aggregate — produce a significant benefit as they replace less efficient retiring jets. Airbus’s chief commercial officer Christian Scherer said last week that Airbus is effectively sold out of A320 family production slots until 2029.

Airbus’s upcoming X-wing or eXtra Performance Wing demonstrator — first reported by The Air Current in September 2021 — is among the near-term candidates for eAction that that have the potential to steer what could advance either another evolutionary step for the A320 family, should Airbus decide to re-wing the single-aisle family in the next decade, or provide the basis for a eventual clean-sheet replacement.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8177812695503235}",neutral,0.8177812695503235,0

Four Disappeared Airbus A340s End Up In Iran - ایران اینترنشنال,"Thu, 29 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyYW5pbnRsLmNvbS9lbi8yMDIyMTIyOTc2MjnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Four Airbus A340s aircraft bound for Uzbekistan departed South Africa last week but diverted to Iran and now the country’s authorities say they have purchased them.

Various flight trackers confirmed their whereabouts at Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport during the week until Iranian aviation authorities confirmed the purchase of wide-bodied, long-range four-engine airliners on Wednesday.

Hassan Khoshkhou, the spokesman for Iran's Civil Aviation Organization (CAO), said that the Airbus A340s are ""made in France"" and had arrived in the country ""in recent days"". He stopped short of providing further details on how the airliners were procured and who facilitated the purchase.

The four A340-300 units – namely MSN 115, 180, 270, and 331 – were formerly operated by Turkish Airlines before their retirement in March and April 2019. The planes were bought by a company from Hong Kong -- AVRO Global – and were later transferred and stored at OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg until December. For the past few years, the planes have simply been parked at Johannesburg Airport, and were registered in Guernsey. There was not much sign of activity until recently, when the planes were re-registered in Burkina Faso with new registration codes — XT-AKA, XT-AKB, XT-AKK and XT-ALM.

The planes started their journeys out of South Africa apparently headed for Uzbekistan but ended up in Iran. The A340s were all produced between 1996 and 2000, so they are 22-26 years old, as are most of the Islamic Republic’s dilapidated passenger fleet, because Iran is not allowed to buy any aircraft due to the US sanctions, which have prohibited companies from selling planes that include US-made parts.

An Airbus 340 operated by Mahan Air

This obviously presents a major challenge for Iran Air and Mahan Air, the country’s two largest airlines, which operate outdated fleets, as they can only get planes secondhand. Even the planes they get secondhand are largely acquired illegitimately through clandestine transactions to circumvent the sanctions. Rumor has it that these four Airbus A340s were purchased by Mahan Air, which already flies several Airbus A340s, most of which used to fly for Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic back in the day.

In September, an official of Iran’s air travel services said that the reason behind a lack of plane tickets and high prices are that more than half of the country’s aircraft are grounded. ""Most of the planes owned by the airlines are grounded because they need parts and it is impossible to provide them due to the sanctions,"" he said. He added that only about 120 to 130 airplanes out of about 340 are operational.

Alireza Barkhor, the deputy chairman of the Association of Iranian Airlines, also said last year that more than 50 percent of passenger planes are not working due to lack of spare parts, particularly engines.

Iran has suffered from shortages of civilian airliners since the 1990s and used a variety of ways to lease older planes or buy spare parts through intermediaries, but the technical state of its fleet has been deteriorating.

The 2015 nuclear agreement (JCPOA) suspended sanctions on purchases of Western aircraft and Iran began talks to buy new planes from Boeing and Airbus. A few Airbus planes were delivered but the Trump administration never approved the sale of US planes until Washington withdrew from the JCPOA in May 2018.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999638795852661}",neutral,0.9999638795852661,0
Airbus reveals plans for hydrogen fuel cell aircraft - CNN,"Thu, 01 Dec 2022 11:30:37 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWZ1ZWwtY2VsbC1lbmdpbmUtcm9sbHMtcm95Y2UtZWFzeWpldC1lbmdpbmUtYzJlLXNwYy1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAWZodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi90cmF2ZWwvYXJ0aWNsZS9haXJidXMtZnVlbC1jZWxsLWVuZ2luZS1yb2xscy1yb3ljZS1lYXN5amV0LWVuZ2luZS1jMmUtc3BjLWludGw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

Airbus has announced it is developing a hydrogen-powered fuel cell engine – and that it plans to test it on the largest commercial airplane ever to take to the skies.

The French aviation giant revealed at Airbus Summit 2022 on November 30 that it will mount the engine between the wings and the tail of a modified A380 superjumbo. Test flights are estimated for 2026, as part of the Airbus ZEROe initiative to launch a zero-emission aircraft by 2035.

“In terms of aerodynamics, the A380 is a very stable aircraft. So the pod attached to the rear fuselage via the stub doesn’t pose much of an issue,” said Mathias Andriamisaina, head of ZEROe demonstrators and tests at Airbus, in a statement.

Airbus had previously revealed concept designs for an aircraft utilizing liquid hydrogen fuel and combustion engines, but vice president of Zero-Emission Aircraft Glenn Llewellyn suggested fuel cells alone might be sufficient to power smaller commercial aircraft.

The engine uses fuel cells to convert the hydrogen into electricity, which then powers a propeller. “At scale, and if the technology targets were achieved, fuel cell engines may be able to power a 100-passenger aircraft with a range of approximately 1,000 nautical miles,” he said.

The journey to decarbonize air travel

Hydrogen has long been touted as a sustainable alternative to traditional jet fuel, either as a combustible fuel or used to generate electricity via fuel cells. The aviation industry produces 2.8% of global CO2 emissions but it faces harder challenges than other sectors in decarbonizing itself, and progress has been slow.

While hydrogen-powered aircraft have been in development since the mid-20th Century, they have faced significant obstacles, mainly hydrogen’s low energy density compared to kerosene, and the latter’s availability and historically low price.

The infrastructure required to produce and distribute hydrogen is also an issue. At Airbus Summit, Airbus boss Guillaume Faury warned that this was “a big concern” and it could derail the company’s plans to introduce a hydrogen-powered aircraft by 2035.

Airbus has previously announced a variety of hydrogen-powered airplane concepts as part of its ZEROe program, including the Blended Wing Body. Airbus

But hydrogen could become a key asset in commercial aviation even before entirely new aircraft based around it are developed. Days before Airbus’ announcement, Rolls-Royce and budget airline EasyJet said they had successfully converted a regular airplane engine to run on liquid hydrogen fuel — a world first, they claim.

The ground test involved a type of Rolls-Royce engine currently used in commercial and military airplanes, and a second test is already planned. Next, the trial will expand to a Rolls-Royce Pearl 15 engine, which is used to power Bombardier business jets capable of long-haul flight.

Future fuel

The fuel for Rolls-Royce’s test was sourced from wind and tidal energy, an example of “green” hydrogen.

Green hydrogen is commonly derived via the electrolysis of water – using electricity to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen – and using renewably sourced electricity to do so. “Gray” hydrogen uses non-renewable electricity, while “blue” hydrogen is similar to gray, but captures most of the carbon emitted in production. Green hydrogen is considered the cleanest option.

How the hydrogen is utilized also creates a different footprint. Burning liquid hydrogen in the open-air releases a small amount of greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. Using green hydrogen to generate electricity in a fuel cell, however, emits only water and warm air.

The next decade will reveal which of the hydrogen technologies will take off. Either would be a positive step in securing the long-term viability of low-carbon air travel.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998862743377686}",neutral,0.9998862743377686,0

It’s this range that truly sets the A321XLR in rare air, bringing single-aisle economics to routes that were previously only serviceable with a widebody aircraft, like the A330 or 787. As lead flight test engineer Jim Fawcett explains of the fuel tanks, “We’ve made some modifications on this aircraft and it was important to check that those work correctly over the full flight envelop of the aircraft.”

To accomplish this test, the A321XLR was fueled to maximum capacity and flown all the way down to the minimum allowable fuel level before landing. This gave the flight test team plenty of time—more than 13 hours—in the air to study the fuel system. Fawcett reports, “all of the transfers worked correctly, all of indications to the crew were good, all of the transfer rates were nominal, so it was very important for us to perform a long flight to check that.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998375177383423}",neutral,0.9998375177383423,0

That’s the principle behind the two-crew requirement for air carrier operations, anyway.

Insurance companies also like the idea of having two pilots up front, and in some cases they may even require it in order to be insured. Miss a memory item? Enter a wrong fix identifier? Things like that are more likely to be caught in time by chore-splitting in a two-crew environment. Plus, it’s a good way to season crewmembers new to the job—or airplane. For all these reasons and more, two-crew operations have been ingrained as a good safety practice.

That may be about to change. Airbus recently held a conference in which it advanced the idea of single-pilot operations. The company said it was in talks with Cathay Pacific about the idea of using a single pilot in the cockpits of long-haul flights. A second pilot would rotate duties. This concept would be introduced gradually, Airbus said, and safety wouldn’t be compromised because automation would manage most chores.

True, automation has its advantages. Fly-by-wire flight control systems lighten pilot workload and are backed up by redundant features. Integrated flight control systems can make for hands-free flying from gear up to short final. Head-up displays paired with enhanced vision systems allow approaches to lower minimums. Autoland can make safe landings in zero-zero conditions.

So why not fly single-pilot? It’s not like two-crew is an iron-clad guarantee of safety.

The crew of a Boeing 757 on approach to the Cali, Colombia, airport entered a wrong fix identifier into the autopilot, and the airplane dutifully turned to it and flew into a mountain.

The crew of an A330, after a one-minute encounter with icing, managed to lose control of the airplane and crash into the Atlantic.

There are plenty of other cases where the two-crew concept broke down, but there must be thousands of cases where one pilot caught the mistakes of another and saved the day.

Let’s not lose sight of the main driver behind any move to make the airlines go single-pilot: money. There’s a lot to be saved by halving the flight crew payroll. Of course, none of this will happen without a huge uproar from the pilots’ unions and a major debate in the worldwide regulatory community—one even bigger than past crew regulatory battles, like the ones years ago that attended the elimination of the flight engineer crew position.

Then, as now, automation, systems improvements, engine reliability, and workload reduction were used to argue for doing away with the crewmember who “flew sideways.”

Automation is great, but I think most of us would feel more reassured knowing that there are two up front. For that matter, so would a solo pilot toting 200-plus passengers. Sorry, Airbus, but any switch to solo should happen later rather than sooner, and only after a long, long, unbiased evaluation period.

This multi-domain flight demo paves the way towards the Future Combat Air System.

Everything has to happen fast now. Two allied fighter jets are deployed, and the success of the entire mission depends on them. For only if they take out the rogue warlord's ground based air defence can the special operations team fly in by helicopter, capture them and bring them before an international court.

The stakes are high, but the odds are in favour of the allied forces: the jet crews have strong support at their side - five drones, so-called remote carriers (RCs), flying ahead, penetrating enemy airspace and using their sensors to detect and mark ground air missile positions. The crews of the fighters then take out the hostile air defences - precisely and without any collateral damage.

First large-scale European manned-unmanned teaming demo

Sounds like science fiction? Not at all. Because a team of specialists from Airbus, the Bundeswehr, the Finnish Defence Forces and industry partners missile company MBDA Germany, networking data link provider Patria, autonomy and mission technology startup HAT.tec and drone launch system provider Robonic, did just that in the late summer of 2022. ""With our Multi-Domain Flight Demo, or MDFD, we demonstrated for the first time in Europe how manned-unmanned teaming capabilities and functionalities with up to ten connected assets work in a real-life inspired scenario and under near operational conditions,"" explains Jean-Brice Dumont, Head of Military Air Systems at Airbus.

In the demo, a Learjet 35 from Airbus subsidiary GFD acted as a surrogate fighter, with the crew on board commanding the remote carriers, five modified Airbus Do-DT25 drones. Two of them were equipped with Electronic Support Measures (ESM) sensors from MBDA to detect the fictional rogue warlord’s ground air missile positions. The remaining three RCs were equipped with Electro Optical (EO) cameras that recorded and confirmed the locations of the air defences visually. All assets were connected by a networking data link from Patria. Additionally, one simulated fighter acting as a command and control aircraft was visible on the screens in the visitor tent where the contractor representatives from the German and Finnish armed forces followed the demo.

A Learjet 35 from Airbus subsidiary GFD acted as a surrogate fighter, with the crew on board commanding the remote carriers.

While the air defence was eliminated, ground troops requested close air support via a forward Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) to help them extract the fictional rogue warlord. An Airbus H145M helicopter responded immediately, helping the team to achieve their mission. In parallel, the H145M teamed up with one of the EO RCs keeping an eye on the surroundings and providing the special forces with reconnaissance data. The helicopter crew commanded the Do-DT25 directly from the cockpit while the video stream of the RC was directly transferred to the H145M. The JTAC, located close to the troops, co-ordinated the attack by digital emergency notification (9-liner request) to the helicopter and partly took over command and control of one EO RC to assess the success of the operation finally.

Vital asset of the Future Combat Air System

""The demonstration was an overwhelming success - the scenario went according to the plan, with the functionalities performing as intended,"" explains Airbus project manager Thomas Gottmann. The MDFD concluded the second phase of the so-called FCAS MUM-T (Future Combat Air System Manned-Unmanned-Teaming) Demonstrator project, funded by the German procurement agency BAAINBw. Now the project is going to enter Phase III, which will lead to maturing of existing capabilities and development of new ones to enable initial operations in the 2030s with existing combat aircraft and remote carriers developed by then. An initial contract for the go ahead has just been signed between Airbus and BAAINBw, as well as between MBDA and BAAINBw.

Remote carriers with different sizes and capabilities are vital assets of FCAS, where they will operate in a team withthe manned New Generation Fighter and the Eurofighter, connected to a cyber-secured combat cloud network. Operating under the command of a manned fighter aircraft, RCs provide better protection for pilots while enhancing the operational envelope and the ability to act in risky situations. “Conducting such collaborative engagements will require high levels of autonomy with only little direct and indirect human control,” explains Gottman

“The MDFD is yet another example of how we push boundaries and pioneer technologies so that our customers can fulfill their missions: saving lives and ensuring a better future for us all”, adds Jean-Brice Dumont. In the demo, this definitely worked as the fictional rogue warlord is no longer a threat to the world.

It will be integrated onto the Meteosat Third Generation Sounder (MTG-S1) satellite next year.

The instrument will continuously monitor key air quality trace gases and aerosols from geostationary orbit with Europe and North Africa in the field of view. Trace gases it will monitor include: nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), ozone (O 3 ), sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ), formaldehyde, glyoxal, and aerosols which are vital for assessing air quality. The development and manufacture of the Sentinel-4 spectrometer for the Copernicus programme was led by Airbus in Ottobrunn/Munich. Understanding the atmospheric composition will help to reduce the risks of phenomena such as desert dust plumes, long-range transport of atmospheric pollutants including pollen, as well as ash plumes from volcanic eruptions.

Test preparations Sentinel 4 UVN instrument Copyright-Airbus-2021-Ralf Maurer

""The information gathered by the Sentinel-4 instrument will help decision makers shape European policies on public health and air-traffic safety to protect European citizens,"" said Philippe Pham, Head of Earth Observation and Science at Airbus. ""The combination of a geostationary satellite and an instrument such as Sentinel-4 means that measurements of trace gases in the Earth's atmosphere can be performed above Europe in record time of about 1 hour.”

The Sentinel-4 instrument is a high resolution spectrometer with a fast revisit time operating in three bands covering the ultraviolet (305-400 nm), the visible (400-500 nm) and the near infrared (750-775 nm) wavelength ranges.

The first model of the instrument will be embarked on the MTG-S1 spacecraft which is scheduled for launch in 2024 and the second yet to be built will fly on board MTG-S2 to be launched in 2034. The purpose is to ensure data availability to the scientific community over a period of two decades.

Both the spacecraft and the instrument will be operated by EUMETSAT, the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites. The Sentinel-4 instrument builds on the experience of previous proven ESA instruments like Sciamachy and Tropomi (on-board Sentinel-5P) also built by Airbus.

The Sentinel-4 mission is an initiative of the European Union and the European Space Agency which provides continuous monitoring of the atmosphere above Europe. Together with the American mission TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution) and the South Korean mission GEMS (Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer), Sentinel-4 will provide scientists with crucial knowledge about air quality of large parts of the northern hemisphere.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9895944595336914}",neutral,0.9895944595336914,0

EGNOS V3 System CDR passed on schedule on 7 Dec 2022

Airbus has successfully achieved the System Critical Design Review (CDR) on the EGNOS V3 satellite-based augmentation system. The EGNOS V3 (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service) is designed to add key security features for the most safety-critical applications such as aircraft navigation and landing, and will provide entirely new services for maritime and land users. EGNOS V3 is the second generation of the overlay system and will improve the performance of GPS and Galileo.

The new V3 generation of EGNOS being developed by Airbus will introduce new services based on multiple frequencies of multiple constellations (GPS, Galileo), and will embed sophisticated security protection against cyber-attacks. The System CDR covers the functional design, external interfaces, operations, security, integration verification, qualification and deployment.

François Gaullier, Head of Telecommunications & Navigation Systems at Airbus said: “EGNOS is a key service across Europe that many people have never heard of, but it is essential for so many applications from air traffic control to maritime operations, and Airbus is committed to further developing the service. Achieving this key milestone on target by the end of the year brings improvements in the performance of navigation satellite systems for safety-critical applications one step closer.”

Javier Benedicto, Director of Navigation at ESA comments: “The successful review confirms that the multi-constellation, multi-frequency EGNOS V3 will be a significant push forward in satellite augmentation. The coming EGNOS V3 will mark a significant step forward enlarging EGNOS accuracy, robustness and overall coverage, thanks to its use of multiple frequencies from both GPS and Galileo.”

EGNOS Exploitation Programme Manager in the European Union Agency for the Space Program (EUSPA) Jean-Marc PIEPLU pointed out that “The increased robustness of EGNOS V3 will allow Europe to further develop its resilience and European actors to continue to develop multi-modal applications. It is with the focus on users’ safety and security that the EUSPA continues to work on EGNOS development together with the institutional and industrial partners.”

EGNOS V3 relies on three operations centres and 44 monitoring stations across Europe and further afield. It monitors the signals from satellite navigation systems and generates augmentation messages, broadcast to all users using transponders on geostationary satellites. In early 2018 Airbus was awarded the prime contract for the EGNOS V3 Implementation Phase by ESA on behalf of the European Union Agency for the Space Programme (previously GSA).

EGNOS general overview

Airbus is currently building the next generation of Galileo satellites which will improve the accuracy of the system as well as the robustness and resilience of its signal, which will be key for the upcoming digital decade. They will provide new capabilities relying on highly innovative technologies such as digitally configurable antennas, inter-satellite links, new atomic clock technologies and fully electric propulsion systems. The new spacecraft will also be more flexible and reconfigurable in orbit to satisfy the expected evolution in end-user needs.

EGNOS is a component of the European Union Space Programme and is managed in the frame of the partnership agreement established between the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Defence, Industry and Space (DG-DEFIS), the European Union Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA) and the European Space Agency (ESA).","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9998700618743896}",positive,0.9998700618743896,1

As part of its mission to support youth development, the Airbus Foundation has launched a new-and-improved Discovery Space platform to encourage interest in STEM subjects: Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. The new site provides fun, motivational material for children and young people to learn about aerospace and more – from technical topics like the science of flight to raising awareness of different possible career paths. And it’s all completely free and open to everyone.

The new platform includes videos, toolkits, experiments and other resources that cover STEM disciplines, with the content tailor-made for users aged 8 to 18, as well as their parents and teachers.

Sparking an interest in STEM subjects

Discovery Space serves a key role within the Airbus Foundation’s youth development programmes: providing resources to encourage young people to continue learning, to inspire them to stay in school and support them to become constructive global citizens

Rachel Schroeder, Managing Director of the Airbus Foundation.

The platform’s content – developed in collaboration with educational experts – is fully aligned with the Airbus Foundation’s support of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal #4: ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education, and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all.

Discover, experiment and inspire

The resources on the Discovery Space platform are organised around three themes designed to resonate with specific age groups:

Discover: For ages 8 to 12, a series of fun animations introduce the amazing world of flight, covering a broad range of topics from sustainable air transportation to Moon missions;

Experiment: For ages 12 to 14, the programme takes a more interactive, experimental approach to STEM-related subjects – because the best way to learn is by doing; and

Inspire: For ages 14 to 18, the focus is on building self-confidence and equipping young people with the skills they need to flourish as they become adults.

“The Airbus Foundation’s youth development programmes reach thousands of young people around the world every year,” Schroeder concluded. “With our new Discovery Space platform, we’re further enhancing this outreach by providing high-quality and ready-to-use content in multiple languages.”

Airbus CEO Warns Sustainability Progress Is Not Coming Fast Enough - Aviation Week,"Tue, 06 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvZW1lcmdpbmctdGVjaG5vbG9naWVzL2FpcmJ1cy1jZW8td2FybnMtc3VzdGFpbmFiaWxpdHktcHJvZ3Jlc3Mtbm90LWNvbWluZy1mYXN0LWVub3VnaNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Years ago, Airbus hosted an annual “technical press briefing” for aerospace reporters. They would be put through two days of detailed presentations on current and future programs as well as market and strategy. When the event was over, notebooks were full of material sufficient for several in-depth stories.

But when the aircraft manufacturer hosted its “Airbus Summit” Nov. 30-Dec. 1 in Toulouse and Munich, the contrast could not have been greater. The OEM presented a highly orchestrated multimedia show for more than 100 journalists and influencers, with many more participating online. Videos, sound and light effects, professional stage decoration and a detailed script were used to push a specific message.

OEM may delay ZEROe service entry if infrastructure lags behind

New concerns about hydrogen leakage emerge

That message, and the reason Airbus put in such an effort in the first place, was all too obvious: The pressure on the aerospace industry to do more to improve its environmental credentials is intense and likely will only increase. And Airbus is trying to position itself as the driver of the sector’s sustainability efforts, which it may be in some respects.

When the message runs up against reality, things get a little more complicated. Boeing is not in a position to launch any major development program that would result in a more efficient aircraft—likely for some years. Because of that, Airbus has no competitive incentive to move ahead on its own, and engine manufacturers have nowhere to put any new powerplants for the time being. And all of this is holding back any near-term leaps forward.

Most initiatives the sector is launching will likely have medium-term effects at best. Airbus’ signature project, the ZEROe hydrogen aircraft, is not likely to have a material effect on the sector’s carbon emissions for many decades. Whether the most promising roads ahead are instead sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and hydrogen is largely dependent on progress in other industries—and political decisions.

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury warned at the summit that things are not moving fast enough. “Ambition is not yet matched by action,” Faury said. “But the clock is ticking. It is difficult to overstate the scale of the energy challenge. The time for excuses is over, the time for action is now.” He indicated, for the first time, that uncertainty about hydrogen supply “could be a reason to delay the launch of the program, even if the technologies for the aircraft are ready.

“I am impressed by how this sector has come together, but overall it is a mixed picture,” Faury said. But he stated that “we need to have 10% of SAF by 2030.” The European Union mandate is for just 5%—and substantially less than 1% of global fuel consumption that is currently covered by SAF. Airbus aircraft are certified for 50% SAF use, with the OEM aiming at certification of 100% SAF by 2030. “We will be leading by example . . . [by investing] our own money,” Faury said.

Much of that money, along with ample French and German public research funds, is flowing into ZEROe. Airbus began by studying three different concepts: a regional aircraft, a narrowbody and a blended wing body. But Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus’ vice president for zero-emission aircraft, all but ruled out the blended wing body. Changing the propulsion system and the basic configuration of the aircraft in one single step would be “too much,” in his opinion. Instead, Airbus is aiming for a classic tube-and-wing concept “with a very different propulsion system,” he said at the summit.

Airbus is leaning toward handling hydrogen storage by putting two tanks behind the pressure bulkhead in the rear of the fuselage. Llewellyn warned that hydrogen aircraft are likely to be more expensive to operate than the cost levels airlines are used to today. “But not disruptively so,” he said. Airbus’ move to explore fuel-cell technology for ZEROe is also strategically relevant for engine manufacturers, and it can no longer be assumed that they are automatically onboard for the project. “But we could easily decide to partner on the engine,” Llewellyn said. Whether Airbus will go with fuel cells or direct hydrogen combustion is a decision for later. “We are not at that stage yet,” Llewellyn said.

Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, is not even at the stage of wholeheartedly supporting hydrogen-powered aircraft. “Hydrogen can be a good thing, but not necessarily,” he said at the summit. In particular, he pointed to the emerging problem of hydrogen leakage, as well as the lack of standards for both hydrogen and SAF. “We have to make sure that SAF and hydrogen are steps forward, not backward.” He urged the industry to pay attention to the details, which may dictate the initiatives’ success or failure.

“Neither Airbus nor any other company has any equipment to measure [leakage],” Krupp said. But it should be investigated sooner rather than later. Hydrogen is not a greenhouse gas (GHG) itself but does have an indirect climate impact. The water vapor it helps create can form cirrus clouds, which increase global warming.

Moreover, to create water vapor, hydrogen combines with hydroxyl radicals that would otherwise react with methane—which is a GHG—and destroy it, Krupp said. The indirect greenhouse effect of 1 kg (2.2 lb.) of hydrogen is many times that of 1 kg of CO 2 .

Leakage could come from pipelines, and the farther the hydrogen is carried, the greater the chance of losses. Moreover, the small size of the hydrogen molecule makes it prone to leak.

The issue of leakage was underestimated for natural gas infrastructure until it was measured and understood, Krupp said. The problem should be carefully looked at, Airbus Chief Technical Officer Sabine Klauke said at the summit. Airbus is working on the issue with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and German aerospace research center DLR, she said, adding that “there are technical means to deal with it.”

As governments fund hydrogen projects, “we have to make sure those subsidies go along with leakage measurement,” Krupp said.

Airbus is working on adding catalysts at those places where hydrogen is about to leak, Klauke said. The catalyst causes a chemical reaction with oxygen, thus forming water. Universal Hydrogen, which is developing an ATR 72 hydrogen retrofit, uses such catalysts on its hydrogen modular tanks.

Meanwhile, Airbus is gearing up to start measuring the composition of the exhaust gases downstream in a hydrogen combustion engine. Under its Blue Condor project, the airframer is modifying two gliders with one small engine each. One is being designed to burn conventional Jet A1 fuel and the other one hydrogen, permitting a back-to-back comparison.

The focus is set to be on contrail formation, as contrails generate cirrus clouds. The question to be answered is how two opposing factors play out downstream in a hydrogen-burning engine: the absence of soot (which act as nuclei for the formation of droplets) and the greater generation of water vapor. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are also to be measured. Instruments will be fitted to a light aircraft that will follow the gliders.

One modified glider has started flying but without the liquid hydrogen system, Sandra Bour Schaeffer, CEO of technology innovation arm Airbus UpNext, said at the summit. Flight testing is planned for the first quarter of 2023.

Airbus’ revelation that it will test a hydrogen fuel cell on an A380 testbed comes 18 months after the launch of the ZEROe project and the initial focus on burning hydrogen in gas turbine engines. An engine close to a turbofan was believed to offer a lighter-weight solution and therefore be more suitable for aviation. Airbus now wants to keep all options open, especially as a fuel cell may have less climate impact overall.

The 2.1-megawatt engine, resembling a conventional turboprop, is planned to be fitted on an upper-fuselage wing stub that is also being designed to test a GE Passport as part of a joint effort with CFM. The fuel cell engine test campaign is scheduled for the same period, 2026-28.

Both technologies use liquid hydrogen and are being explored in parallel, Llewellyn said. “At scale, and if the technology targets were achieved, fuel cell engines may be able to power a 100-passenger aircraft with a range of approximately 1,000 nm,” he added. “We are giving ourselves additional options that will inform our decisions on the architecture of our future ZEROe aircraft, the development of which we intend to launch in the 2027-28 time frame.”

A hydrogen fuel cell and the associated electric motor and propeller are expected to be more efficient than burning hydrogen in a gas turbine. Other benefits include the absence of NOx (which is suspected of contributing to global warming) and an even lower probability of forming contrails, which are known to play a role in global warming.

The test engine is being put together in Hamburg, Germany. It has been assessed at subsystem level, as the electric motor is still being tested.

Airbus has been cooperating with fuel-cell specialist ElringKlinger. In 2020, the two companies created a joint venture, Aerostack. The fuel cell in the test engine uses an arrangement that puts together cells into stacks, and the stacks into four so-called channels, making the layout scalable.

Before installation on the A380, full engine evaluations will take place at Airbus’ E-Aircraft System House ground-test center in Munich.

For the test engine, the Hamburg team kept subsystems segregated for better accessibility. Engineers came from the company’s space division—to take advantage of their skills in batteries—and Airbus Helicopters, for the gearbox that will link the motor and the propeller.

The biggest challenge will be weight. One should look at the full equation, factoring in the better efficiency, Hauke Luedders, head of fuel-cell propulsion systems for zero-emission aircraft, said at the summit.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9891481995582581}",neutral,0.9891481995582581,0

"Riding the wave: Airbus Helicopters, Inc. - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine","Tue, 13 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL3JpZGluZy10aGUtd2F2ZS1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtaW5jL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It’s been a tricky couple of years for most of us. Enduring waves of pandemic-induced lockdowns to emerge into energy and economic crises caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it has felt like we’re going from one era-defining challenge to the next. Not that you would get any hint of this chatting to the eternally positive Romain Trapp.

He stepped into his role as president of Airbus Helicopters, Inc. (AHI — the OEM’s U.S. subsidiary) and head of Airbus Helicopters North America (AHNA) in 2019, just a few months before AHI celebrated its 50th anniversary. He had been in the saddle less than a year when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, with the resulting governmental restrictions changing the way people live, work, and move around the globe. Almost all businesses were impacted by the pandemic, but Trapp said the critical missions performed by many helicopters helped insulate their operators to a large degree.

“Seventy-five percent of the helicopters flying in North America are flying for critical missions,” he told Vertical. “At the time of Covid, these critical care missions were needed even more than before.”

The result was no decrease in flying hours for the Airbus Helicopters fleet in North America from 2019 to 2020. AHI recorded a drop in new aircraft sales, but customers still took delivery of their existing orders throughout the year, and activity at the company’s various facilities in the region remained static.

Trapp said the adjustment to the changing situation in the first months of the pandemic was relatively straightforward, driven by the need to provide continuous support for the critical missions of its customers.

“We had to support the police, the Coast Guard, the air medical industry,” he said. “We had to support the helicopters fighting fires, and they were counting on us to do so.”

In 1979, Airbus Helicopters, Inc. won an order for the U.S. Coast Guard for 100 HH-65 Dauphins. Trapp called this order a “gamechanger” for the OEM’s operations in the region. Skip Robinson Photo

Employees worked from home where that was possible. Those who needed to be on-site, whether for support and services or production purposes, changed their work schedules and shift patterns to ensure they were able to do so safely.

“We would try to spread people as much as possible and everybody was on board, because everybody knew that we had a duty to perform, which was helping our operators, saving lives and protecting people,” said Trapp.

A growing demand

This year, AHNA is facing demand for aircraft not experienced for a decade, while its customers are recording more flight hours than they were pre-pandemic in 2019. The sales demand is split about evenly between single-engine aircraft (H125 and H130) and light twins (H135 and H145). Historically, the region would be seeing more of a 60/40 split, Trapp said, with single-engine aircraft representing the larger chunk of sales.

“[The change] is not because the single is not selling well — the single is selling as expected, as in line with previous years,” he said. “It’s actually because we see a significant increase in demand on the twin side.”

This desire for twins has largely come from the air medical sector, he added.

The overall growth in sales has been driven by a “mix of different things” depending on the market segment, said Trapp. On the law enforcement side, he said there was a “strong need for fleet replacement” that had been put on hold due to the pandemic, but that funding was now being made available to various agencies. This trend, he said, should continue in 2023.

In 2021, the U.S. Army’s UH-72 Lakota fleet exceeded the one million flight-hour mark, just 15 years after the type entered service. Skip Robinson Photo

Fleet replacement has also driven growth in the air medical sector, said Trapp, but this is beginning to level off due to the impact of the No Surprises Act (passed to restrict surprise medical billing in emergency contexts). This has created a delay in operators getting paid by insurance companies. Still, at AMTC22 Elevated (the air medical industry’s foremost conference and tradeshow), AHI revealed it had recorded more than 35 orders in the sector over the last 12 months.

Finally, the private and business aviation sector has continued to provide a steady stream of sales, despite the prevailing economic headwinds.

“Private/business aviation was very strong last year, is very strong this year, and will continue to be strong,” said Trapp. “In all fairness, [this] took us a bit by surprise, but I think it’s also because many of the actions which we had launched in the past have been paying off.”

The two trends driving this growth have been the attraction of private/business clients who are new to the helicopter world, and existing users who are upgrading to newer technology. The five-bladed H145 has proven particularly appealing to the latter group, said Trapp, thanks to the aircraft’s capability and the smoothness of its ride.

This year, AHI delivered the first ACH130 Aston Martin edition in North America. “Between the ACH130 and especially the ACH145, we have two bestsellers right now for this market,” said Trapp.

Those three sectors — law enforcement, air medical, and private/business aviation — have each made up roughly a third of AHI’s sales this year. Trapp said utility sales are yet to rebound — something he hopes to see next year — while the oil-and-gas sector is showing “very positive” signs after years of significant challenges in the sector. There is a clear trend in this sector for a move from heavy- to medium-lift aircraft, he added — a requirement AHI hopes to address with the H160 and H175.

A delayed entry

As recently as February, Airbus had been targeting this summer for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval of the most recent addition to its fleet — the H160. The type was certified by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) on July 1, 2020, and the manufacturer had hoped FAA certification would follow soon afterwards, paving the way for deliveries to launch customers in the U.S.

However, work to secure that approval was hampered by the pandemic, and the FAA opened up more topics for clarification than Airbus expected. More than two years later, that work is still ongoing.

“We have provided lots of documents to the FAA and I think they are now going through their process,” said Trapp. “It’s taking time, but it’s moving forward. . . . We are all eager to get there as quickly as possible.”

Though wary to speculate on a timeline for approval, Trapp said they are “getting closer to the finish line.” PHI, the type’s launch operator in North America, has taken part in pilot and maintenance training on the type, and the first aircraft is ready and waiting to be delivered in Grand Prairie.

Pre-pandemic, Trapp had spoken enthusiastically about the type’s prospects in North America — calling it a “gamechanger” that would be a bestseller in the medium market for years to come. Today, he’s just as optimistic.

AHNA has restarted the process of gaining FAA approval for the H175, with Trapp saying customers are keen to introduce it into offshore operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Airbus Photo

“We are selling the H160 right now in North America — and we have several deals which are in the final stage of being signed before year-end,” he said. “The way our customers look at it is: ‘You are Airbus, we know you’re going to get it done. Which means when I buy a helicopter today, and the delivery is in two years-ish from now, I know you will get it done. So, I’m not worried. I want the aircraft because I love the aircraft.’ We see actually a stronger demand than what we were expecting from having the delay in certification in mind.”

The other type in the manufacturer’s fleet that could meet offshore demand is the H175. The type was certified by EASA in 2014, at which point Airbus was also pursuing FAA approval. This process was then paused for several years — but the manufacturer is now actively pursuing it again.

“We have restarted the process, [and] there have been several discussions,” said Trapp. “In hindsight, maybe it was not the best decision we took [to pause the certification process], but OK, now we need to catch up, because the demand is there.”

He said the company’s experience with the H160 would help expedite things. “We are learning our lessons and are going to have hopefully a very collaborative approach with the FAA in order to get the aircraft certified as soon as possible.”

Site specialization

Five years ago, Airbus Helicopters underwent a significant reorganization of its sites in North America, with each focusing on a specialty. Grand Prairie, Texas, is AHI’s headquarters, a Center of Excellence for most of its support and services activity, and home to a training center and dynamic component repair shop. The company’s main warehouse is at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, allowing speedy and straightforward shipping across the continent and to South America.

Columbus, Mississippi, is home to final assembly lines (FALs) for the H125 and H145, and is also where aircraft are customized. It also provides some maintenance services. North of the border, Airbus Helicopters Canada in Fort Erie, Ontario, focuses on the manufacture of composite parts and support for Canadian customers; while a site in Fort Rucker, Alabama, has a dedicated warehouse and team to support the U.S. Army’s Airbus fleet at the base.

“Firstly, [site specialization] allows us to avoid duplication,” said Trapp. “It has allowed us to concentrate and put in one site the best of our people, to have leaner processes and really to be able to cope more efficiently with an increase in demand. And I’m glad we did it, because we have seen over the last year-and-a-half a significant increase in demand, which will continue in 2023. And now we have the means to be able to manage it.”

AHNA has more than 1,000 employees, and continues to actively recruit to meet the growing demand.

“In 2021, we grew our turnover by about 10 percent versus 2020,” said Trapp. “In 2022, we are on a similar trend of plus 10 percent, and when I see what we have to deliver in 2023 in terms of new helicopters, in terms of retrofit, maintenance, supporting our customers with spares and so on, I am expecting around the same figure. So, it’s significant growth, and of course you need people, and we hire as we need.”

In terms of his ambitions for AHNA, he said he is taking a “pragmatic approach” to bringing in any additional capabilities.

“We want to be closer to our customers, and when it makes sense from an industrial standpoint to bring more capabilities, we do so as the demand arises,” he said. “It doesn’t take long for growth to lead to a need for additional capability.”

One thing customers in North America could see on their side of the Atlantic before long is one of VRM Switzerland’s virtual reality training devices. The company recently signed a global partnership with Airbus, and Trapp revealed the two are working to bring a device to Grand Prairie. “It’s an amazing device, and we are looking forward to enhancing our partnership with VRM,” he said.

All in all, Trapp said it’s an exciting time to work in the helicopter industry, which he believes is on an upward trend that will continue for several years — especially in North America. “Our helicopters save lives and protect people every day,” he said. “This is what motivates all of our employees to come to work every day — and this is what drives me, too.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9937652349472046}",neutral,0.9937652349472046,0

The deal is part of Poland’s efforts to boost its military reconnaissance capacities following Russia’s invasion of its neighbor Ukraine.

Polish Defence Minister Mariusz Błaszczak and French Armed Forces Minister Sébastien Lecornu signed the contract Dec. 27 in Warsaw.

A spokesperson for the Polish ministry told Defense News that the net value of the deal is about €575 million (U.S. $612 million).

“The Polish satellites will be launched into space until 2027,” the spokesperson said. “Already in 2023, the Polish Armed Forces will gain access to the resources of the existing Pléiades Neo [Earth observation] satellite constellation.”

The two satellites will be delivered to Warsaw along with a receiving station.

“The satellites will increase the capabilities of the Polish military in the field of acquiring reconnaissance data based on observation satellites operating as part of the French-Polish constellation,” the ministry said in a statement. “Owing to them, it will be possible [for Poland] to obtain reconnaissance data in the field of image reconnaissance with an accuracy of up to 30 cm, and operations within the constellation will allow for imaging a significantly larger area of the Earth than it is possible for a single country.”

Błaszczak said other issues he discussed with his French counterpart included areas of defense cooperation that could benefit Ukraine’s fight against Russia. Lecornu is scheduled to pay an official visit to Kyiv and meet with Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov on Dec. 28.

"Airbus slows its roll, but still plans growth in production - AL.com","Tue, 06 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzL21vYmlsZS8yMDIyLzEyL2FpcmJ1cy1zbG93cy1pdHMtcm9sbC1idXQtc3RpbGwtcGxhbnMtZ3Jvd3RoLWluLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24uaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has eased off the gas on planned production growth for some of the jetliners it builds in Alabama, though the adjustment appears to be no threat to expansion plans in Mobile.

The manufacturer announced Tuesday that it wasn’t going to hit its ambitious post-pandemic forecast of around 700 aircraft deliveries in 2022. But the company said it made 68 deliveries in November, bringing the total so far this year to 565 and bringing a year-end total of well over 600 within reach.

The day’s announcement also came with a slight adjustment to the forecast for the A320 family of jetliners. Airbus builds A320-family jets in Toulouse, France; Hamburg, Germany; Tianjin, China; and Mobile. It has announced major expansion plans for A320 production facilities in Mobile, with new facilities to be built by 2025. The work could mean 1,000 new jobs at the Airbus campus in the Brookley Aeroplex.

Airbus’ latest wording on A320 production represents a subtle change.

What the company said as it announced first-quarter results in May: “Commercial aircraft production for the A320 Family is progressing towards a monthly rate of 65 aircraft by summer 2023, in a complex environment. Following an analysis of global customer demand as well as an assessment of the industrial ecosystem’s readiness, the Company is now working with its suppliers and partners to enable monthly production rates of 75 in 2025.”

What Airbus said Tuesday: “Taking into account the fact that this complex environment will persist longer than previously expected, Airbus will be adjusting the speed of the A320 Family ramp-up to rate 65 for 2023 and 2024. Airbus maintains the objective of reaching rate 75 by the middle of the decade.”

So: Production of 75 A320 jets per month by 2025 (or 2025-ish) is still the goal, which is good news for Mobile. The ramp-up to get there just won’t be as aggressive.

Why not? Bloomberg News reported that it’s largely because of ongoing supply-chain disruptions: “The aviation industry has been beset by parts shortages on everything from small components to engines. The crisis has been compounded by soaring energy prices squeezing suppliers, and [Airbus] Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury cautioned last week that there’s unlikely to be any improvement until the end of next year.”

For context, Airbus reports that as of Nov. 30 it had delivered 440 A320-family jets in 2022. That works out to 40 per month, an average that doesn’t tell the whole story. A320 deliveries accelerated from 24 in January to 53 in November.

Airbus also assembles smaller A220 family of jets in Mobile, one of two sites where it does so. The A220 and A320 are sometimes grouped together as single-aisle production.

As of November 30, Airbus had delivered 45 A220s, with monthly production generally trending upward. Six were delivered in November.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9986808896064758}",neutral,0.9986808896064758,0

DALLAS — Making a play in reducing CO2 emissions in its own operations, Airbus, in cooperation with AirSeas, an Airbus startup, has begun testing its SeaWing technology.

The SeaWing is an automated kite that employs parafoil technology. Intended to tow large ships, the manufacturer has tested the system on its own “roll on/roll off” ships that transport large aircraft parts between its production sites in Europe and the U.S.

The SeaWing is launched by simply activating a switch. The kite then deploys, unfurls, and operates autonomously as its systems collect and analyze meteorological and oceanic data to optimize performance. When the kite is no longer needed, the SeaWing automatically refolds and is recovered on the ship, ready for its next deployment.

The system was developed by AirSeas, a small Airbus startup that combined its own maritime expertise with Airbus’ knowledge of aerodynamics, flight controls, systems, and materials.

Using the system, the company expects to lower shipping costs by around 20% while reducing Airbus’ overall industrial environmental footprint by 8,000 tons of CO2 per year.

The trial took place on board the Ville de Bordeaux, which is chartered by Airbus, during a transatlantic voyage. The SeaWing flies at an altitude of about 200 meters and comes in both 250 sq meter and 500 sq meter versions.

“We are very proud that Airbus has confirmed its confidence in the SeaWing system after seeing our test results first-hand on their own ship,” explained AirSeas CEO and founder Vincent Bernatets, who previously worked at Airbus in managerial, marketing, after-sales, and business development positions. “This first ro-ro vessel installation opens the way for further pioneering deals on container ships, bulk freighters, and ferries.”

According to an Airbus press release, the SeaWing is designed for rapid integration on almost all commercial ships in operation today. Its design enables installation and maintenance during regular stopovers at ports of call.

According to GCaptain.com, AirSeas has received five firm orders and 51 options for SeaWing systems from Japanese shipowner K-Line which owns the fifth largest fleet worldwide.

Airbus To Support Pratt & Whitney In Future Engine Technology Effort - Aviation Week,"Mon, 05 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvZW1lcmdpbmctdGVjaG5vbG9naWVzL2FpcmJ1cy1zdXBwb3J0LXByYXR0LXdoaXRuZXktZnV0dXJlLWVuZ2luZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWVmZm9ydNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has agreed to help CFM International with an engine demonstration program that could lead to a Leap replacement to power future single-aisle aircraft. Airbus is also embarking on a similar project with Pratt & Whitney to succeed the PW1000 geared turbofan family in the 2030s.

The airframer’s early involvement marks the beginning of new relationships being forged between airframers and engine-makers. New propulsion systems might require more integration with the aircraft, notably through a hybrid-electric architecture—the integration of gas turbines and electrical motors.

Companies are involved in MTU-led water-enhanced turbofan project

Airbus is partnering with Renault on a hybrid-electric layout

Airbus and Boeing are years away from defining replacements for their A320neo and 737 MAX families, respectively, but engine-makers are already preparing the technologies they may use for them. An engine has a long development cycle, and when an airframer expresses a need, manufacturers prefer to pitch relatively mature solutions. That process entails the launch of engine research and technology programs, including demonstrators, well ahead of new aircraft programs.

Airbus and Boeing are definitely expected to require drastic cuts in fuel consumption. Current technologies cannot meet such specifications, so engine-makers are considering new ways to improve efficiency. That is what CFM has been doing with its Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) program, to be supported by Airbus in flight testing.

Pratt & Whitney’s answer to RISE is beginning to emerge, as an MTU Aero Engines partner in the EU-funded Sustainable Water-Injecting Turbofan Comprising Hybrid-Electric (Switch) program. Airbus is a partner, too. “It is not the time for competition yet; it is the time for assessment,” says Karim Mokaddem, Airbus’ head of electrification.

MTU is leading Switch as part of the EU’s Clean Aviation public-private partnership. Switch aims to combine the benefits of MTU’s water-enhanced engine concept with a hybrid-electric architecture.

MTU’s other major partners are Collins Aerospace and GKN Aerospace. Together, they are pursuing a 25% reduction in CO 2 emissions, an 80% cut in nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and an unspecified decrease in contrail-inducing emissions.

“This project will enable us to advance several key technologies on our road map to further extend the efficiency of the geared turbofan [GTF] engine architecture,” says Geoff Hunt, Pratt’s senior vice president of engineering and technology.

A water-enhanced turbofan (WET) engine adds a condenser to collect water from the GTF exhaust gas and a heat exchanger to vaporize that water into steam. The steam is then injected into the combustor, improving fuel efficiency. The temperature profile eliminates most of the hot spots where NOx forms, and most particles are washed out instead of forming nuclei in the contrail process.

The large heat exchanger, however, has an unfavorable effect on transient regimes, making the engine less responsive. That is what the hybrid-electric architecture can counteract, says Claus Riegler, MTU’s senior vice president for technology and engineering advanced programs.

“WET technology is relevant for the improvement it brings in the cruise phase’s climate impact, while hybrid-electric is for better local air quality at airports,” he adds.

For Pratt’s parallel hybrid propulsion system, Collins plans to supply a 500-kW motor generator on the high-pressure spool and a 1-megawatt motor generator on the low-pressure one. They would be useful for electric taxiing and for a boost at takeoff as well as in other transient phases, says Pratt Chief Sustainability Officer Graham Webb.

Phase 1 of the program, in 2023-25, is fully funded and is planned to include various assessments. A hybrid-electric GTF engine is set to be tested on the ground, and WET technology to be evaluated at the component and subsystem levels in a laboratory. Design activity would take place around the combination of the two concepts.

In addition, aircraft integration is set to be studied. “There will be an impact on the architecture,” Mokaddem says. To start with, batteries are more likely to be located in the fuselage than in the nacelle, and the electrical network’s voltage would change. In addition, global energy management is needed to ensure a benefit at the aircraft level.

The program begins at relatively low technology readiness levels (TRL). WET is hoped to stand at TRL 2.5-3 by year-end and reach TRL 4 at the end of Phase 1 in 2025, Riegler says. If the program follows on with a 2025-30 Phase 2, possibly including flight tests, WET may hit TRL 6 in 2029-30, he adds. OEMs usually prefer TRL 6 as the minimum technology basis from which to launch an engine program.

Meanwhile, the hybrid-electric propulsion system is starting at TRL 3, and Pratt is targeting TRL 5 at the 2025 end of Phase 1, according to Webb. Simultaneously, integration will be at TRL 4-5, Mokaddem says.

Among the challenges are the engine’s weight and size. Riegler expects a 50% weight penalty. While the fan diameter will be unaffected, length will increase to accommodate the heat exchanger, he says. Drag is therefore anticipated to increase, and the plan for a 25% improvement factors in those drawbacks.

Switch technologies are planned to be compatible with conventional Jet A1 fuel and sustainable aviation fuels and will be evaluated for use with hydrogen.

In a hybrid-electric architecture, batteries are seen as the weak link that drags down efficiency. To address that, Airbus has signed a partnership agreement with car manufacturer Renault to improve the technology. As with Switch, CFM’s RISE demonstrator is planned to include hybrid-electric systems, but Pratt is putting a greater emphasis on their use.

A hybrid-electric configuration alone would lead to a 5% improvement in fuel consumption, Mokaddem says, despite a 1-metric-ton weight penalty. But to meet the 5% target, specific energy—the energy-to-weight ratio—is still too low. “A current-technology 200-Wh battery weighing 1 kg [(2.2 lb.)] would only contain enough energy to carry itself on a 1,000-km [(540-nm)] flight,” he says. He sees a need for a twofold improvement.

Meanwhile, Renault has been advancing the battery technology, especially on the Zoe, a small five-seat car that has been mass-produced for 10 years. Over that period, the improvement in specific energy has been twofold, says Patrick Bastard, Renault’s vice president for research. Progress has come from chemistry and battery pack design, he explains.

Solid-state batteries might be the holy grail, potentially twice as good as the best lithium-ion batteries. A ceramic electrolyte could replace the liquid electrolyte, and a lithium metal anode would supplant the graphite anode. “Today, solid-state batteries are working in a laboratory environment, but scaling up is difficult,” Bastard says. “It will happen, but not until 2030.”

Airbus and Renault are creating joint teams. They plan to work together on cell-to-pack integration—notably on materials and connectors—and on the battery management system’s efficiency and safety. Life-cycle assessment is set to be a focus, too. Renault has transformed one of its factories to prepare batteries for reuse or recycling.

It took almost two years and several design iterations for Airbus to be convinced of the benefit of a hybrid-electric architecture. At first, adding technology bricks was not creating an efficient system, Mokaddem recalls. Nonpropulsion needs proved to be the right starting point, even though engines must eventually be part of the layout. Airbus at some point discovered that engine manufacturers were studying hybrid-electric, too, under a similar approach. The companies’ teams easily converged.

In a hybrid-electric architecture, an engine’s transient regime is helped by electric motors, says Frank Haselbach, Airbus’ senior vice president for propulsion engineering. The motors could contribute at takeoff and brief climbs while in cruise. Moreover, the high-pressure compressor can be designed with a smaller operability margin, increasing its efficiency. Electric motors can accelerate the high-pressure spool if needed, a task that requires a higher margin if performed thermodynamically, Haselbach explains.

Airbus’ target is 800 volts, a level that is an option for cars, Bastard says, which usually use 400 volts. Increasing the voltage improves the electric system’s efficiency but comes with a higher risk of arcing. “We explored up to 3,000 volts, but that was too much. We want to stick around 800 volts,” Mokaddem says.

A hybrid-electric commercial aircraft could enter into service in 2030-35, he adds. A step in that direction is set to be implementation of the Ecopulse demonstration program in cooperation with Daher and Safran.

Jetstar ramps up digital PaxEx on Airbus narrowbodies with Bluebox - Runway Girl Network,"Tue, 06 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvamV0c3Rhci1kaWdpdGFsLXBheGV4LWFpcmJ1cy1ibHVlYm94L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“The digital cabin is here.” So says Kevin Clark, the CEO of Bluebox Aviation Systems, whose customer Jetstar Group has started accepting deliveries of Airbus A320neo family aircraft with the airframer’s Open Software Platform (OSP) already installed, and Bluebox’s so-called Blueview software stack and content riding atop it to facilitate wireless inflight entertainment and e-commerce for passengers.

Under the optional OSP program, which is part of the broader Airbus Airspace Link ecosystem, Airbus linefits embedded servers, routers, Wi-Fi access points and operating software to its aircraft. Airlines then have the flexibility to choose from a portfolio of partners — Bluebox, Inflight Dublin and Display Interactive — which provide the software stack and content (including ‘airline native’ apps) to load onto the Airbus platform for their passengers.

Jetstar selected Bluebox’s Blueview solution for its Australian low-cost carrier as well as Jetstar Asia’s Airbus aircraft, and will market a customized version to passengers as ‘Jetstar Entertainment’. The Jetstar A320neo family aircraft “have got the OSP”, Clark confirmed to Runway Girl Network at the recent APEX/IFSA Exhibition in Long Beach. Indeed, the carrier’s first A321LR, which arrived in Melbourne this summer, has it installed.

But to ensure a consistency of service for Jetstar’s current A320/A321ceos, the airline will carry Bluebox’s aircraft-powered Wow wireless IFE units onboard and the Blueview software stack. “[F]rom the passenger point of view, it’s exactly the same experience,” said Clark.

Indeed, the ability to tick the box for Airbus OSP to be factory-fit to new aircraft deliveries, whilst selecting the chosen software partner’s own retrofittable or portable wireless IFE hardware for aircraft already in one’s fleet can be a key value-add for airlines.

Passengers, meanwhile, can stream entertainment and other content via the browser-based portal to their own personal devices. But the Bluebox solution goes further.

Clark explained: “We were talking two years ago about the possibilities of the digital cabin. I think everyone kind of gets what digital cabins can offer. We’re delivering capabilities that allow that to happen and that’s what we’re doing with the airlines like Jetstar, for example, where we’re starting off on the IFE side but we’re moving into the retail side as well and some of the other capabilities. So, if you’re looking for a digital cabin, we’re there and we can offer that.”

Airbus management concurred that Bluebox and indeed other Airbus OSP partners have invested heavily in onboard retail functionality, going “that step beyond only music, movies, games” and other content like moving maps and magazines, to support inflight shops that generate ancillary revenue for the airlines.

Bluebox does, however, seek to differentiate itself in the Airbus OSP program. “We have lightly different functionality or we deliver the capabilities and the software functionality in a slightly different way,” explained Clark. The functionality behind Blueview supports the secure delivery of content, third-party app integration, content management and analytics.

For its part, Airbus celebrated the simplicity and sustainability of OSP, highlighting its ability to offer one technology backbone that integrates seamlessly into the aircraft, and ensuring airlines have a choice of software/content provider.

“We are the OEM. We understand what aircraft technology is, so we do what we do best and they do what they do best, which is integrating either content from one of the studios here or developing the moving map feature or shops [for] purchasing your new sunglasses or your watch. Let them do that and we take care of the aircraft technology,” said Airbus upgrades marketing director Yannic Duifhuizen.

Arianespace SAS, the company operating the rocket, said Wednesday that an engine on part of the vehicle had experienced a drop in pressure. That prompted officials overseeing safety for the flight to send a command to destroy the vehicle, in keeping with standard operating procedures.

""It is a challenging moment for all the Airbus teams"" involved in the satellites, Airbus said.

The Tuesday-night flight from the European rocket-launch facility in South America began normally. No one was injured, Arianespace said.

Airbus envisions air medical services as first use case for CityAirbus NextGen eVTOL - Vertical Magazine,"Sat, 03 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWVudmlzaW9ucy1haXItbWVkaWNhbC1zZXJ2aWNlcy1hcy1maXJzdC11c2UtY2FzZS1mb3ItY2l0eWFpcmJ1cy1uZXh0Z2VuLWV2dG9sL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“Public health and emergency services are one of the first use cases of any new technology, and this is why we believe air medical services will really be one of the first use cases [for eVTOLs],” said Balkiz Sarihan, head of urban air mobility (UAM) strategy execution and partnerships at Airbus.

The CityAirbus NextGen will be Airbus’ first fully-electric aircraft, targeting an operating range of 80 kilometers (50 miles) and cruising speed of 120 km/h (75 mph). The eVTOL will be capable of carrying three passengers and a pilot. Airbus Image

Believing that emergency medical services (EMS) is a key application for eVTOL aircraft, the aerospace company dedicated its entire UAM session at its Airbus Summit on Dec. 1 to discuss its LifeSaver program, an EMS system that the company developed alongside International SOS. The program is currently being trialed in Estonia, with plans to make the system available for governments around the world.

As the CityAirbus NextGen eVTOL matures and becomes available for public services, Airbus said its fully-electric aircraft can be used to complement existing HEMS missions to improve patient outcome.

“Novel air mobility offers huge opportunities,” said Henrik Hololei, director general of mobility and transport at the European Commission, during the Airbus Summit. “It is estimated that by 2050, over 70% of the world’s population will be living in cities. This calls for novel forms of transport to meet the increasing demand from the public to address mobility needs, as well as deliver public services.”

While Airbus firmly believes eVTOL aircraft can play a role in air medical services to improve patient outcome, they won’t be replacing traditional helicopters anytime soon.

“The power, capability and versatility of what a helicopter can deliver, both in terms of ability to reach and the amount of in-cabin inflight interventions that can be done, is impressive,” Sarihan said. “We are not at all suggesting that the first generation of the CityAirbus NextGen will have stretchers, defibrillators and all the complex inflight capability. This is not realistic.”

But the CityAirbus NextGen could complement or add value to existing helicopter missions. With its electric-powered zero emissions capability and low noise profile, eVTOLs could provide an alternative solution to carry out missions where helicopters might be met with restrictions.

“It’s a perfect blend of the capability and range that a classic helicopter provides and the new capability that an eVTOL can add,” Sarihan said. “This is also why it’s interesting to use tools like LifeSaver to obtain this holistic view.”

While Airbus doesn’t have plans to operate its own aircraft, it does play an active role in building out the UAM ecosystem. This includes working with aviation authorities to finalize regulations, ensuring infrastructure is in place to support operations, and working with stakeholders to test use cases for eVTOL aircraft. The company took significant steps toward developing this ecosystem earlier this year when it launched its Air Mobility Initiative in Germany.

The aerospace company is advocating for EMS to be one of the first applications for its eVTOL aircraft, but Sarihan said it is just one of three use cases that Airbus is initially focusing on. In addition to air medical services, Airbus said its eVTOLs will first be used for ecotourism and scheduled passenger shuttle services — applications that it believes “will allow the use and acceptance of this type of technology to scale step by step.”

Unlike its rival eVTOL companies that are targeting on-demand passenger carrying services, Airbus is instead taking a “pragmatic approach,” realizing that point-to-point air taxi services “is not for tomorrow,” Sarihan said.

Also in contrast to its competitors, Airbus is taking its time to mature its technology and the UAM ecosystem. The company’s financial standing, “allows us the freedom to take a longer term perspective. What we are building and maturing here is the industry, the program, and the business of tomorrow,” Sarihan said.

The CityAirbus NextGen is a culmination of the company’s research and development in the eVTOL field. The aircraft will be Airbus’ first fully-electric model, targeting an operating range of 80 kilometers (50 miles) and cruising speed of 120 km/h (75 mph), capable of carrying three passengers and a pilot.

“The technology brings something that is unmatched — the technology of electrification, distributed propulsion, low sound levels, and zero emission flight,” Sarihan said. “All of this is useful for us when we are building urban air mobility, and it also has an incredible benefit to the rest of our products.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9670308828353882}",neutral,0.9670308828353882,0
"Airbus delivers MicroCarb instrument, the first European mission to measure atmospheric CO2 - Airbus","Fri, 09 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTEyLWFpcmJ1cy1kZWxpdmVycy1taWNyb2NhcmItaW5zdHJ1bWVudC10aGUtZmlyc3QtZXVyb3BlYW4tbWlzc2lvbi10by1tZWFzdXJl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A special passenger crossed under the Channel this week: the MicroCarb instrument, en-route to be integrated with its satellite platform at RAL Space (Rutherford Appleton Laboratory) in Oxfordshire, England.

MicroCarb is a small satellite designed to map sources and sinks of carbon dioxide (CO2)—the most important greenhouse gas — on a global scale, to better understand the impact of CO2 produced by human activity and how this greenhouse gas is released and absorbed.

A French initiative in the frame of the Paris agreement on climate and the COP21, MicroCarb is the first European project to measure CO2 globally. The mission will complement the American and Asian on-going missions and is a precursor for future Copernicus missions such as CO2M.

CNES selected Airbus to develop and build the payload: the MicroCarb instrument, based on a passive spectrometer.

During its five year long mission from its Sun-synchronous orbit, 650km above the Earth, the 190kg satellite will measure the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere to better understand the flows between carbon sources and sinks, the carbon cycle of our planet, and improve weather forecasts.

Its dispersive spectrometer instrument will be able to measure atmospheric concentration of CO2 globally with a high degree of precision (on the order of 1 ppm) and with a pixel size of 4.5 km x 9 km.

The payload, designed and produced by Airbus, will be flown on a microsatellite built around CNES’s Myriade spacecraft bus and assembled and tested at RAL Space (Rutherford Appleton Laboratory) facilities by Thales Alenia Space, on behalf of UKSA, who partnered with the French Space agency.

The instrument, by analyzing the sunlight reflected by Earth, will track the modifications of the solar rays induced by the various molecules met by the photons while passing through the atmosphere. By focusing on the known and precise wavelengths specific to carbon and methane molecules, it is able to identify their presence and measure their concentrations across the globe.

This mission involves the French scientific community studying climatology and the carbon cycle. The MicroCarb mission includes funding from French Investments for the Future Programmes, as well as from the European Union framework programme for Research and Innovation, Horizon 2020.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9980339407920837}",neutral,0.9980339407920837,0

Helicopters once again play a key role in many of the ensuing firefighting, rescue and disaster relief efforts.

In this unpredictable and multifaceted milieu, the need for versatile rescue solutions strikes home for many of us now more than ever. Therefore, it’s no surprise that public service agencies rely on helicopters that can seamlessly swap roles, moving from one mission to the other. Airbus products fit the bill, with the H125, H130, H145, H225, and now the H160, among others, being popular choices for multi-mission operators.

The aerial firefighter

Firefighting — traditionally considered to be just one of the many aerial roles of helicopters — is now becoming one of their most critical tasks, especially in the summer as wildfires become increasingly larger, faster, and more difficult to control.

Firefighting makes up the second-largest segment (after law enforcement) in the worldwide public services fleet today, with 15 percent of the approximately 4,960 public service units in service performing firefighting missions. Of this, approximately one-quarter of the world’s firefighting aircraft are Airbus helicopters — the major players being the multi-mission H125, H145, H215 and H225.

These helicopters can perform a large range of tasks to support firefighting missions: water bombing, surveillance and reconnaissance, personnel and equipment transport, and command and control. Thanks to their versatility, helicopters are the perfect complement to other air assets and a crucial element to firefighting operations.

The air medical asset

From the intermediate single-engine H125 and H130, to the twin-engine H135 and H145, Airbus Helicopters’ customers lead the way when it comes to saving lives.

The most recent addition is the five-bladed H145, which boasts a leg up when performing air medical missions thanks to the added useful load of 150 kilograms (330 pounds). This makes a huge difference when every second and every kilogram counts.

The helicopter recently entered service with the French Securité Civile where it has already been called upon to perform lifesaving emergency medical flights and search and rescue patrols during floods.

In Norway, the Norwegian Air Ambulance Foundation uses its new H145 for research, development and training to improve helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS), testing new procedures and equipment with the goal of improving patient health and saving more lives.

The versatile H160 enters service

The H160 is making its way around the world, having entered service in Japan in August with Japanese launch customer All Nippon Helicopter, which is using the aircraft for news-gathering missions for Japanese broadcasters, and in July, with a private customer in Brazil.

The French Navy has received the first H160 configured for search-and-rescue at sea. Meanwhile, final assembly of the first H160 equipped for law enforcement for the French Gendarmerie Nationale has begun in Airbus Helicopters’ facility in Marignane, France.

The H160 has been designed to create added value in terms of performance, comfort, safety, perceived sound, and fuel consumption. But it is also highly versatile and can be adapted for a myriad of essential missions, such as emergency medical services, law enforcement, public services, oil and gas, and military.

Supporting first responders

Support and services are likewise crucial for these essential missions. That’s why customers, such as STARS air ambulance in Canada and Air Methods in the U.S., continue to count on HCare global support contracts to keep their fleets in the air and ready to respond when the call goes out.

In 2022, Airbus Helicopters revamped its HCare support offering to better align with customer needs. It now includes HCare Initial, HCare In-service and HCare Lifetime. With many customers operating legacy or out-of-production aircraft, such as the Dauphin, H120, Gazelle and Puma, the new offering also includes the recently launched HCare Classics support package specifically designed to meet these operators’ unique needs. French operator HeliDax recently signed up its fleet of 36 H120s, becoming the launch customer.

With regard to the H160, public services customers opting for this aircraft will benefit from its innovative support concept, which sets new standards of support and maintenance, including an optimized maintenance plan, simplified field maintenance, 3D technical documentation, interactive training, and a connected ecosystem.

This year has proven to be a strong one as the market continues to recover. Airbus Helicopters’ bookings level increased in the first half of 2022, and its market share is above 50 percent of the civil and parapublic market.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998822212219238}",neutral,0.9998822212219238,0
"Judge to Split Airbus, Qatar Airways A350 Trial – Airways - Airways Magazine","Sat, 17 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vc3BsaXQtYTM1MC10cmlhbC1haXJidXMtcWF0YXItYWlyd2F5cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DALLAS — A new court decision has been taken as the dispute between European aircraft manufacturer Airbus and Middle Eastern airline Qatar Airways (QR) continues: split the trial in 2023.

While Airbus seems content with the decision, QR’s primary position is that it opposes the application by Airbus to split the trial into dealing with issues of liability and then quantum. The airline’s take on the matter is that the fact that Airbus had to ask for this suggests that it is not well-prepared.

This quarrel between two major companies started because of paint issues QR is encountering on some A350s. The airline grounded the aircraft and refused to take delivery of any additional A350s. Airbus would later cancel all of QR’s orders, including numerous A321neo and A350 family airplanes.

The issue has already been debated in a UK court this year, but the trial has not yet started. In May 2022, a judge issued orders for a “speedy trial” and gave an indicative window of June 2023 for the beginning of the official trial.

However, Airbus raised concerns that a June 2023 trial may not be possible because of shortcomings in the airline’s disclosures. At the last court hearing, the European plane maker managed to convince Judge David Waksman to split the trial for June 2023 into two parts.

Qatar Airways wants to resolve the dispute as a matter of urgency as it has had to resort to leasing aircraft from other airlines, which is undesirable from a business stance.

With regard to commercial support or settlements relating to the acceptance of repairs for problems similar to the surface deterioration of the A350s that QR is experiencing, Airbus has been in communication with other operators, according to a Request for Information that the airline has submitted.

For the state-owned flag carrier airline of Qatar, it is clear that these documents exist, though it has not received a complete disclosure of them.

Airbus Welcomes the Decision

Airbus said it was “successful” as the judge decided that the matters that will be debated during the June trial will be “narrowed significantly” and will include “only the core matters.” However, QR said it wanted the court “to deal with as much of the dispute as possible at the trial.”

While Airbus says it “welcomes” the outcome of the hearing, the company has previously stated that splitting the trial may not be enough if the documents from QR do not arrive soon.

Conversely, QR’s stance is that Airbus has not been forthcoming with the commercial settlements it has entered into with various airlines relating to the condition and/or corresponding repairs of their A350 aircraft

The airline also claims that a further inquiry into Airbus’ actions regarding the delivery slots purchased by Qatar Airways for the delivery of the A321-Neos order, which Airbus has since claimed to have terminated, raises concerns about the company’s continued lack of candor.

With this new court hearing and a judge’s decision to split the trial planned for June, the dispute between QR and Airbus should last until the end of 2023 at the soonest.

Comments from Qatar Airways

A Qatar Airways spokesperson said, “Qatar Airways’ applications in this CMC sought to address the asymmetry of information caused by the fact that Airbus, the manufacturer of the A350, has failed to provide key technical information relating to the defect which is necessary for conclusive analysis as to the root cause.”

“We were pleased that the judge agreed with our applications and ordered the information be provided quickly to ensure the key issues are properly addressed by the independent experts.”

“In a trial of this scale, bifurcation is not unusual, and therefore it was not unexpected that the Judge ruled on this. The split of quantum issues was a compromise between both side’s preferences and we are pleased that this will ensure the key technical issues are the focus of the summer trial.”

Airbus – the view from the summit - Royal Aeronautical Society,"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9zb2NpZXR5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy10aGUtdmlldy1mcm9tLXRoZS1zdW1taXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TIM ROBINSON FRAeS reports from the 2022 Airbus Summit in late November, where the airframer highlighted its progress towards sustainable aviation and net zero by 2050.

At a nondescript facility in Otterbrunn, near Munich, Germany the future of sustainable aviation is coming together. Two years on from Airbus’s public announcement of its vision of hydrogen airliners, real hardware is now under test for this and other projects that will realise zero-carbon flight. The Otterbrunn facility, opened in 2019, is Europe’s largest R&D centre dedicated to electric flight, and features test bays that are now filled with fuel cells, electric motors, batteries and power cables, while two large hydrogen tanks outside give a glimpse of the zero-carbon future. Inside, engineers are busy working on hydrogen fuel cells for a regional airliner, propulsion systems for the CityAirbus eVTOL, and superconducting cryogenic power cable – as well as even more futuristic projects to not only beam power from space to the Earth using microwaves, but also from space to aircraft in flight and onwards, promising a dynamic, reconfigurable power grid where electricity is wirelessly transmitted to where it is needed.

The path to NetZero

A tour of this hi-tech e-aircraft facility was part of a two-day Airbus Summit held in late November/early December in Toulouse and Munich for members of the world’s aviation press, providing an update on Airbus’ future product strategy, innovation and its partnerships on the path to net zero in 2050. The latter, partnerships, are critical given the scale and speed of the climate challenge that aviation must address and a reminder that even for a corporate behemoth like Airbus, it cannot go it alone. The Summit thus saw news of new partnerships with companies and organisations such as SAF producer Neste, car-maker Renault and European research lab CERN – all focused on accelerating progress in decarbonisation. These new partners join a growing ecosystem of airports and airlines that Airbus is working with around the world.

The theme of the summit, “action in a time of crisis” according to Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury highlighted the growing momentum in recent years that has now been supercharged by dire warnings from last year’s global COP27 climate summit and the adoption by ICAO of long-term aspirational goals (LTAG) on aviation sustainability at the 41st Assembly. Despite this rapid change, Faury expressed impatience at the pace: “Is the world moving fast enough to net zero? Is aviation moving fast enough to net zero? Realistically - not yet”. Yet despite the war in Ukraine, supply chain issues, skills, uncertainty over China and the threat of global recession, decarbonisation is still the number one challenge for the aviation industry to secure a future where air travel can grow, and still be sustainable.

Airbus fuel cell engine

However, the Summit demonstrated that the pace of sustainability is now accelerating - with ground testing of hardware for Airbus’ ZEROe project now underway, which aims to develop a H2 powered airliner by 2035. In particular, Airbus used the summit to reveal it had been working on a second hydrogen propulsion system as part of its ZEROe project. Instead of burning hydrogen as a fuel, this would use a hydrogen fuel cell that would generate electricity, to drive an electric motor, and then a propeller. With ground testing of the H2 fuel cell stacks already underway in an ‘Iron Pod’ test cell in Otterbrunn, (complete with giant machine to put representative in-flight propeller loads through the entire system) the engine will be flight tested in 2026 onboard Airbus’s A380 prototype, MSN1 mounted on a pylon. This aircraft is already earmarked as the test-bed for a H2 combustion propulsion flight testing with a GE Passport and will now test two alternative systems. To that end, Airbus revealed it was partnering with space launch company Arianespace to develop a special hydrogen fuelling station at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport specially for these test flights.

With the first ZEROe application likely to be in the smaller regional 100-passenger/1,000nm range bracket, the development of a propeller H2 fuel cell engine gives additional flexibility to Airbus in deciding its pathway to zero carbon flight, although it says it also welcomes the other engine manufacturers, such as Rolls-Royce with its recent H2 engine ground test, joining the ‘panorama’ of future options that could be available.

The exact configuration and propulsion though for the first ZEROe airliner is still undecided, but Glenn Llewellyn, VP, Zero-Emission Aircraft, noted that of the ZEROe concepts revealed the BWB (blended wing body) version was least likely to be chosen, due to the challenge of integrating a radical flying wing airframe with a novel new propulsion system. That he said, would likely push the schedule rightwards from the target date of 2035.

To further support the ZEROe initiative, early this year will see the first powered flight tests of Airbus’ Blue Condor hydrogen contrail study in the US, where two gliders (one with a small jet engine burning kerosene and other burning H2) will fly at representative airliner cruising altitude. In the very first test of this kind, a chase aircraft will measure non-CO2 emissions produced by a hydrogen engine.

Hydrogen and SAF – the production challenge

Is supply of SAF keeping pace with demand? (Airbus)

But one constraint on this vision of Airbus’s goal of future carbon free flight could be the availability of ‘green’ hydrogen (made by renewable power) around the world, as well as the vast task ahead in scaling up the supply of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), despite the growing demand from the world’s airlines. Said Airbus CEO Faury: “Availability or lack of availability of clean hydrogen at the right quantity in the right place at the right price in the second half of the decade is a big concern for me. The infrastructure for producing and distributing green hydrogen is still in the early stages of development. But the clock is ticking for it to be in place to fuel commercial aviation by the 2030s”. Airbus’ ZEROe aircraft plan, thus hinges on the availability of green hydrogen as fuel.

In parallel, although there is now widespread agreement the roll-out and scaling up of SAF, the supply still lags behind. At the Summit, Thorsten Lange, EVP, Renewable Aviation, Neste (the world’s biggest producer of SAF), revealed that the company had produced just 100,000t of SAF in 2022, and despite bringing online production facilities of capable of producing over 1million tonnes in 2023, this would still fall short of what will be needed. In fact, he noted the world would need ’40 more Nestes’ to achieve the goal of 10% SAF by 2030. And, while Airbus’s airliners are already certificated for 50% SAF blend and the company is aiming for 100% compatibility by 2030, Faury noted, that in this case, there was no need to hurry, given the lack of SAF available. To that end, Airbus announced at the Summit that it would be partnering with Neste to accelerate and ramp-up the roll-out of SAF world-wide.

However, Airbus still sees hydrogen as the “most powerful” tool from all the other measures in meeting long-term net zero targets, according to its CTO Sabine Klauke.

The Moon – the answer to Earth's green energy shortage?

With a piece of European-built Airbus space hardware having powered the Orion module, as part of NASA’s successful Artemis 1 translunar mission, there was also a session on Airbus’ vision for sustainable lunar exploration and (whisper it quietly) exploitation – particularly for the material resources needed to power the zero-carbon economy of the future.

Laura Todd, Airbus VP Space Exploration - Future Programmes, pointed out that Earth’s supply of lithium, crucial for the lithium-ion batteries that power everything from mobile phones to cars and eVTOLs, will, under current projections, run out in 2075/80. This could be even sooner, given the way in which decarbonisation is driving demand for batteries. However, she explained that on the Moon there are 40 million tonnes of lithium awaiting extraction as well as the tantalising prospect of Helium-3 isotope on the Lunar surface, which potentially could provide almost limitless green energy in nuclear fusion. Some critics might balk at the idea of mining the moon for raw materials but if the alternative is the zero-carbon revolution comes to a shuddering halt at the end of the century, despite resources being (comparatively) close at hand, then might the sustainable future of Earth, depend on the Moon?

Defence gets sustainable

An RAF Airbus Voyager took off from RAF Brize Norton on 18 November to conduct a flight test using 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in both engines. This was a world first for an in-service military transporter and also the first 100% SAF flight of any aircraft type carried out in UK airspace. (Airbus)

Another part of Airbus’s business previously not known for sustainability is its defence arm, where the war in Ukraine had been a wake-up call to European nations to rethink their attitudes to defence companies and how a robust military is key to protecting hard-won individual freedoms, democracy and societal progress. “The importance of defence has been re-recognised” due to Ukraine, said Airbus Defence chief Michael Schoellhorn, who noted that when he took over as CEO the previous year the big debate was around the ESG (environmental, social and governance) values of the defence industry – particularly in Germany.

Furthermore, as well as decarbonisation and climate change, the issue of sustainability is also linked to the security of supply chains and energy dependence. Schoellhorn, for example, revealed that the commercial arm of Airbus is now rapidly decoupling from its reliance on titanium from Russia – and this would be complete in ‘Months not years’. However, he warned that: “We need to make sure that we don’t make ourselves dependent on US” pointing out that Europe could end up swapping its dependence on Russian energy for dependence on US weapons as it seeks to rearm and replenish depleted munition stocks in the wake of the war in Ukraine. Berlin, for example has already chosen the Lockheed Martin F-35, Boeing P-8 Poseidon and could well end up selecting the AH-64E Apache, despite the presence of this home champion.

Up next at UpNext

Another partnership announced at the Summit, by Sandra Bour-Schaeffer, CEO of Airbus’ innovation lab UpNext was with European nuclear research entity CERN, best known for smashing atoms in the Large Haldron Collider. With Airbus, it will assist in developing thin cryogenic superconducting cables, which would allow for the transfer of large amounts of electrical power with maximum efficiency, utilising the physical properties where electrical resistance disappears ultra low temperatures. For designers of future electric aircraft, who may need to snake power cables through exotic configurations or incorporate distributed propulsion into their designs, these small diameter superconducting cables are the Holy Grail of electric aircraft allowing for power to be distributed across the whole airframe.

Talking to AEROSPACE, Bour-Schaeffer also revealed progress on other UpNext projects, including FelloFly – a which mimics the efficiency of migrating birds by having airliners fly in close formation. This approach, which would see airliners indicate their availability to others to join a ‘car share in the sky’ can save 5% in fuel burn and has already demonstrated as technically feasible using A350s. This project has now been shifted from UpNext to the main Airbus entity for commercialisation.

Another exciting project from UpNext is the eXtra Performance Wing demonstrator, set to fly in 2024. This will see a standard Cessna Citation VII bizjet have its existing wings removed to convert it into the worlds most advanced full scale aerodynamics demonstrator. Replacing those wings will be an ‘intelligent wing’ incorporating a high-aspect ratio design and semi-elastic moveable wingtips, developed from the AlbatrosONE subscale demonstrator. Fitted with active gust controls, LIDAR in the nose will see ahead to spot turbulence while multifunction trailing edges devices will continuously morph and adapt the wing to all stages of flight. Airbus will fly the XPW demonstrator early this year, to establish baseline performance of its aerodynamics, before modifying with the new wing to fly from Cazaux air base, France in 2024. Interestingly it will be remotely piloted from the ground, rather than with a pilot onboard as Airbus say they intend to push the wing technology to the very limits. All in all, said Bour-Schaeffer, the wing could deliver “huge fuel savings of 5-10%”. She also said that this new wing could be available for all future Airbus products, a hint that it could potentially be considered for a rewinged A320neo.

DisruptiveLab chopper breaks cover

Meanwhile the Summit also showed how, despite only amounting to less than 1% of emissions compared to commercial aviation, the decarbonisation agenda is now spreading to the rotary world. “The trend is there, the commitment is there” says Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters with customers now weighing sustainability/ESG factors when choosing a new helicopter. Like airlines, helicopter operators are now seeing increasing numbers of passengers opt-in to net-carbon offset schemes when offered the choice.

The Summit also saw Airbus Helicopters reveal a new green rotorcraft demonstrator. Based on the already sleek H120, the Disruptive Lab features parallel hybrid propulsion, integrated skids, a 20% drag reduction on the fuselage and a 40% reduction in parts of its fenestron tail rotor. It also features a more compact and reduced drag rotor head, to again increase efficiency as well as reduce noise. This demonstrator, in conjunction with other initiatives such as the FlightLab and the high-speed RACER project aiming for 50% fewer CO2 emissions from vertical flight.

Summary

Momentum towards a greener future for aviation is building - but can everyone keep up? (Tim Robinson/RAeS)

This summit then showed the remarkable progress then that has been achieved so far since Airbus revealed its ZEROe ambitions in 2019 - not only in actual hardware being tested, but also in the wider hydrogen ecosystem and partnerships that are coalescing around Airbus’ leadership. However, while the hydrogen-powered ZEROe programme is probably the most visible, radical and ambitious of Airbus sustainable projects, it is important to remember that is only part of the company’s wider drive towards net zero, with others including electric, hybrid-electric, ultra-efficient aerodynamics and SAF that all will play their part. And, with the entire aviation sector having publicly that it will accelerate its efforts over the past few years, there will be “no hiding place for us if we fall short” said Airbus chief Faury.

However, the progress shown was extremely positive, with Faury concluding that “our sector now has a credible pathway to net zero in 2050”. With technical barriers falling, the real question is, can the supply of these new fuels scale up in time?

Airbus Foundation looks to put satellites to new biodiversity conservation uses - Mongabay.com,"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5tb25nYWJheS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi9haXJidXMtbG9va3MtdG8tcHV0LWl0cy1zYXRlbGxpdGVzLXRvLW5ldy1iaW9kaXZlcnNpdHktY29uc2VydmF0aW9uLXVzZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Connected Conservation Foundation and the Airbus Foundation are currently accepting proposals for an award to support the use of satellite imagery for biodiversity conservation.

The competition winners will receive access to Airbus’s Pléiades and Pléiades Neo satellite constellations and $5,000 in financing.

The satellites deliver images with resolutions down to 30 centimeters (12 inches) and could be used in applications such as anti-poaching, forest monitoring, and species population assessments.

The Airbus Foundation and the Connected Conservation Foundation (CCF) recently announced a new award for research that would use satellites to aid in biodiversity conservation.

The application period, open to individual researchers and nonprofit organizations, began Dec. 5 and ends Feb. 3, 2023. A team of four judges will assess the potential of proposals designed to address the global loss of species, which many scientists call Earth’s sixth mass extinction. Along with $5,000 in funding, the award comes with access to Airbus’s Pléiades and Pléiades Neo satellites. Pléiades Neo images come from a quartet of satellites offering spatial resolution down to 30 centimeters (12 inches).

“The open call sets out to look at the species in situations where high, 30-centimeter resolution imagery can really have a benefit,” Sophie Maxwell, executive director of CCF and one of the judges of the competition, told Mongabay.

CCF is an organization that aims to encourage the use of technology in conservation and nature protection applications, such as anti-poaching and population monitoring. In 2021, the group partnered with the Airbus Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the European aerospace company.

The goal, Maxwell said, is to find the bounds of the role that remote sensing can play in biodiversity conservation, including what it does and doesn’t do well.

“We have looked at use cases such as road detection [and] charcoal kiln detection, with variable levels of success,” Maxwell said. High-resolution imagery can help biologists better tabulate the sizes of wildlife populations. But there are limitations. Picking out the shapes of wildebeest against the varied background of an East African savanna, for instance, can be difficult, so projects aimed at monitoring on a more uniform background may work better, she added.

“One of the best examples perhaps would be counting penguins or other birds in the Arctic or Antarctic on their breeding grounds,” said Anna Schweiger, a postdoctoral researcher in remote sensing at Switzerland’s University of Zurich, who is not affiliated with CCF or the Airbus Foundation.

Schweiger noted that Pléiades Neo has a deep blue band for probing bodies of water. She said scientists have used WorldView, another set of satellites, to spot whales in clear water as deep as 30 meters (approximately 100 feet).

Schweiger said deep learning, a kind of machine learning and artificial intelligence, could be employed in tandem with Pléiades’ high-resolution imagery to gain new insights.

“The explosion of AI on satellite imagery is also making it much more … valuable and easier to get insights … because you’ve got analysis running on these huge images,” Maxwell said.

Schweiger said that scientists must be careful with the results of remote sensing, and noted that this type of imagery could have uses beyond conservation. (Airbus, for example, markets access to the Pléiades satellite constellation for military and intelligence uses.)

It’s also possible that imagery detailing, say, “the migratory routes of large swarms of fish,” could fall into the wrong hands, Schweiger said. “I can see that being a detriment to the survival of certain species.”

Still, Maxwell said addressing the biodiversity crisis requires innovative solutions, which she hopes the competition for this award will help to drive.

“This is a great chance to explore where this technology can help conservation efforts,” she added.

Review: Spirit Airlines A321 Big Front Seat (FLL-AUS) - One Mile at a Time,"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL3Jldmlld3Mvc3Bpcml0LWFpcmxpbmVzLWEzMjEtYmlnLWZyb250LXNlYXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"I recently spent a weekend in Austin, and I decided to fly Spirit Airlines on the outbound. While Spirit Airlines is known for being no frills, I’m quite a fan of the airline, especially if you approach your journey in the right way.

In this post I wanted to review Spirit Airlines’ Airbus A321 product, including the Big Front Seat, which is what I booked. Spirit Airlines offers an all around pleasant experience, between the Big Front Seat, high speed Wi-Fi, and a very friendly crew.

How I booked my Spirit Airlines ticket

Spirit Airlines is an ultra low cost carrier, meaning that the airline charges extra for just about everything. My ticket cost $87.14 including taxes & fees (it may have been cheaper if I had booked at the airport), and I booked the following flight:

12/08 NK517 Fort Lauderdale to Austin departing 1:15PM arriving 3:21PM

On top of that, I paid $120 to assign the Big Front Seat. While the premium for booking the Big Front Seat has increased significantly over time, I think it’s still fairly priced, especially when you consider that I spent over 3.5 hours in my seat.

On top of that, Spirit ordinarily charges for carry-ons and checked bags. However, I have Spirit Airlines Gold status (the Free Spirit program offers a status match challenge), so I receive a complimentary full size carry-on bag, and even a checked bag. Therefore I wasn’t out of pocket for any extra fees.

Spirit Airlines check-in & boarding

My 1:15PM flight from Fort Lauderdale to Austin was scheduled to board at 12:30PM, so I got to the airport a bit before 12PM. I had checked in online, and found Spirit’s app to be surprisingly great. Spirit Airlines departs from Terminal 4 at FLL, which is probably the best terminal at the airport.

Fort Lauderdale Airport terminal

My flight was departing from gate G4, located toward the end of the terminal. Boarding started right on-time, with Zone 1 passengers being invited to board first (that includes those who paid extra for a carry-on).

Spirit Airlines A321 cabin & seats

My flight was operated by the Airbus A321 with the registration code N664NK, a nearly seven year old jet. It’s worth noting that the plane I was on had Spirit’s oldest interiors — the airline started installing new seats in 2019, and plans on introducing all-new interiors again as of early 2023. Across the board, the new seats seem to represent an improvement over the old product.

Spirit’s Airbus A321s feature a total of 228 seats. This includes eight Big Front Seats, and then 220 standard seats.

Spirit Airlines Airbus A321 cabin

Let’s first talk about the main part of the cabin. Standard economy seating is in a 3-3 configuration, as you’d expect on a narrow body jet. Seat pitch on Spirit Airlines starts at just 28″, which on the surface is incredibly tight.

Spirit Airlines Airbus A321 cabin

While I didn’t have the chance to actually sit in these seats, dare I say that the legroom didn’t look that bad? That’s especially true when you consider that the seats don’t recline, so no one will further encroach on your space.

Spirit Airlines Airbus A321 seats

Interestingly the standard seats don’t have full size tray tables, but rather have much smaller tables than you’ll typically find. That shouldn’t be an issue in terms of food & drinks, given the limited selection. That being said, it’s not ideal if you want to work on a laptop, or want to watch entertainment from a personal device.

Spirit Airlines Airbus A321 seats

The Big Front Seats are at the front of the cabin — there are a total of eight of these seats, in a 2-2 configuration.

Spirit Airlines Airbus A321 Big Front Seat cabin

Spirit Airlines Airbus A321 Big Front Seat cabin

Big Front Seats are very similar to the first class seats you’d find on other airlines within the United States. The seats have 36″ of pitch, and feel quite spacious.

I assigned myself seat 1A, the window seat in the first row (it was the only one available when I booked).

Spirit Airlines Airbus A321 Big Front Seat

The seats do have headrests, which makes them a bit more comfortable when lounging around. I’d note that the seats aren’t as well padded as what you’d otherwise find in domestic first class, as the seats are quite thin.

Spirit Airlines Airbus A321 Big Front Seat headrest

Unlike in the rest of the cabin, Big Front Seats have full size tray tables, which sure come in handy, especially if you’re looking to work on your laptop.

Spirit Airlines Airbus A321 Big Front Seat tray table

In addition to the tray table, there was a center console where you could place drinks or personal belongings.

Spirit Airlines Airbus A321 Big Front Seat center console

Much like in the main cabin, Spirit Big Front Seats don’t recline (or as Spirit likes to phrase it, they’re pre-reclined).

Spirit Airlines Airbus A321 Big Front Seat no recline

The overhead console had individual air nozzles as well as reading lights.

Spirit Airlines Airbus A321 overhead console

Note that there are no power outlets on Spirit Airlines planes, including at Big Front Seats.

Since this was an older style cabin, the overhead bins weren’t the larger ones you’ll find on many newer Airbus jets. That should change over time, though frankly isn’t an issue one way or another on Spirit, since not that many people have carry-ons.

Spirit Airlines Airbus A321 overhead bins

All-in-all, I find the Spirit Big Front Seat to be a comfortable way to fly. The standard economy seats also don’t look as bad as you might assume, based on the 28″ of pitch.

Spirit Airlines departure from Fort Lauderdale

The boarding process was efficient, though did take quite some time, as you’d expect for a full flight with 220+ passengers. The crew was lovely during boarding, greeting each passenger with a big smile, and even inviting kids to visit the cockpit.

As longtime OMAAT readers will know, I’m a big fan of good airline boarding music, and Spirit Airlines has a very nice, calming track playing throughout boarding. At 1:10PM the main cabin door was closed, at which point the captain added his welcome aboard, informing us of our flight time of 2hr33min, and our cruising altitude of 36,000 feet.

After that, one of the flight attendants made her enthusiastic welcome aboard announcement, referring to herself as “the hostess with the mostest.” Lol. I love how she continued that announcement — “while safety is our priority, service is our passion.” What an awesome attitude. A few moments later the manual safety demonstration was performed.

We pushed back from the gate shortly after 1:10PM.

Pushing back from gate Fort Lauderdale Airport

We then started our taxi at 1:15PM, and had a pretty short journey to runway 10R. There we had to hold short for a few minutes, both as a Spirit A321 to Houston took off, and as another jet landed.

Taxiing Fort Lauderdale Airport

By 1:25PM we were cleared for takeoff. As usual, the views were great taking off into the east, out over the Atlantic, before making a sharp turn.

The seatbelt sign was turned off about 20 minutes after takeoff.

Spirit Airlines high speed Wi-Fi

Spirit Airlines has done a fantastic job rolling out Wi-Fi throughout most of its fleet, as both A320s and A321s now have Thales’ FlytLIVE Wi-Fi. There was even a decal by the boarding door about this, as well as a pamphlet in my seatback.

Connecting to Spirit’s Wi-Fi system was easy.

Spirit Airlines Wi-Fi portal

Spirit Airlines Wi-Fi portal

Spirit Airlines’ Wi-Fi pricing is reasonable, and ranges from $3.99-11.99 per flight for browsing, and from $6.99-14.99 for streaming. On this flight, a browsing pass was available for $6.99, while a streaming pass was available for $9.99.

Spirit Airlines Wi-Fi pricing

Interestingly even though Spirit charges for Wi-Fi, there’s still an ad you have to watch before you can access Wi-Fi. I wouldn’t expect any less from Spirit. 😉

Spirit Airlines Wi-Fi ad

On the plus side, the Wi-Fi speed was excellent. It worked consistently throughout the flight, with high speeds (unlike my return flight on Southwest, where it was unusable).

Spirit Airlines food & drink selection

Spirit Airlines charges extra for all food and drinks (except cups of ice, which I suppose could be a DIY approach to enjoying complimentary water). You can find the full menu below.

As you can see, you can either select things individually, or you can purchase bundles. Also note that Spirit Airlines Gold members receive a complimentary non-alcoholic drink and snack. You can select from any items with the Free Spirit (“S”) logo next to them.

For my complimentary selection, I ordered a Diet Coke and some pretzel twists. I also decided to order the cheese tray, just to take one for the team and report on Spirit’s most premium dining experience. 😉

Spirit Airlines food & drinks

The cheese tray included sharp cheddar, smoked gouda, american cheese, crackers, dried apples, and cranberries. Funny enough, Spirit seems to sell the same cheese plate you’ll find on Frontier.

Spirit Airlines cheese plate

I was surprised that when I mentioned to the flight attendant that I’m a Gold member (for the purpose of getting the food & drinks comped), he said “thanks for your business, I don’t think I’ve ever done one of these before” (referring to entering the comp item into the tablet for elite members). I guess Spirit doesn’t have that many elite members, heh.

Spirit Airlines A321 lavatories

Spirit has only three lavatories on its A321s, which isn’t a great ratio. One was at the front of the cabin, while two were in the back. Despite the limited number of lavatories, there weren’t consistently lines to use the forward lavatory. I guess if food & drinks are only available for purchase, people don’t have to use the bathroom as much.

On the plus side, the bathroom was reasonably clean, and people seemed to have pretty good bathroom etiquette (unlike on my Frontier flight a while back).

Spirit Airlines A321 lavatory

Spirit Airlines service

The five Spirit Airlines flight attendants on this flight were honestly exceptionally professional. I’ve generally found that Spirit has great employees, and this flight was no exception. I wrote about this in a bit more detail in a separate post, but they were professional, fun, entertaining, and great ambassadors for the airline. If only the average crew at a legacy airline were as good as these five…

Spirit Airlines arrival in Austin

A little over two hours after departing Fort Lauderdale, we began our descent toward Austin. The seatbelt sign was turned on around five minutes after that. It was a mostly smooth descent, though we did hit some bumps toward the end of the approach, as we passed through some thick clouds.

We touched down in Austin at 2:55PM. From there we had a roughly five minute taxi to our arrival gate, and then it took another five minutes for the door to open, so we were still there well ahead of schedule.

Taxiing Austin Airport

Bottom line

I had a fantastic Spirit Airlines flight, and wouldn’t hesitate to fly with the airline again. Ultra low cost carriers bring valuable competition to the market, and Spirit is my favorite of these airlines. I love how Spirit has high speed Wi-Fi, the Big Front Seat, and a great frequent flyer program. On top of that, I had an awesome crew on this flight, which always makes a flight better — it’s nice to be around people who enjoy their jobs.

While as a Miami resident I still prefer flying American out of Miami, I’ll gladly fly Spirit again when the schedule or route is the best option.

Two Airbus Earth-imaging satellites poised for launch on Vega C rocket – Spaceflight Now - Spaceflight Now,"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VmbGlnaHRub3cuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMTkvdHdvLWFpcmJ1cy1lYXJ0aC1pbWFnaW5nLXNhdGVsbGl0ZXMtcG9pc2VkLWZvci1sYXVuY2gtb24tdmVnYS1jLXJvY2tldC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Two Pléiades Neo Earth observation satellites are set to join Airbus’s constellation of high-resolution optical imagers with a launch Tuesday night from French Guiana on the first commercial flight of Europe’s Vega C rocket, a mission delayed from November to change out suspect hardware on the launcher’s payload fairing.

Liftoff is set for 9:47 p.m. EST Tuesday (0147 GMT Wednesday) from the Guiana Space Center in South America, marking the 22nd flight of Europe’s solid-fueled Vega rocket family, and the second in the uprated Vega C configuration.

The 114-foot-tall (34.8-meter) Vega C rocket will propel itself north from the European-run spaceport in French Guiana, heading for a polar orbit with the two Pléiades Neo Earth-imaging satellites for Airbus. The satellites each weigh about a ton at liftoff, and are stacked one on top of the other inside the Vega C’s payload shroud.

The mission Tuesday night, designated VV22, will be the first commercial flight of the new Vega C rocket configuration, following the Vega C’s inaugural test flight July 13 sponsored by the European Space Agency. Arianespace, the Vega rocket’s commercial operator, is in charge of the launch of Airbus’s Pléiades Neo 5 and 6 satellites.

The launch was delayed from Nov. 24 to replace faulty hardware in the pyrotechnic system responsible for jettisoning the Vega C rocket’s payload fairing a few minutes after liftoff. The aerodynamic fairing encloses the Pléiades Neo 5 and 6 satellites during the rocket’s climb through the atmosphere.

The Vega C rocket replaces the old Vega rocket’s solid-fueled first and second stages with wider, heavier motor casings. The third stage motor is unchanged, and the restartable liquid-fueled fourth stage has the same type of engine but carries more propellant. The Vega C’s prime contractor, the Italian aerospace company Avio, says the upgraded rocket is capable of hauling up to 5,070 pounds (2.3 metric tons) of payload mass to a 435-mile-high (700-kilometer) polar orbit, an increase over the 3,300-pound (1.5-metric ton) capacity of the basic model of the Vega rocket.

The upgraded Vega C is also taller than the older Vega rocket configuration, and has a larger payload fairing provided by the Swiss company Beyond Gravity, formerly known as RUAG Space.

The higher-performing Vega C can carry two of Airbus’s Pléiades Neo Earth observation satellites on a single mission. The first two satellites in the four-satellite Pléiades Neo constellation launched on separate Vega rockets in 2021.

The Pléiades Neo satellites feature improvements over Airbus’s first-generation Pléiades Earth observation satellites launched in 2011 and 2012. Airbus says it entirely funded the development of the Pléiades Neo satellites, with intentions to sell the imagery commercially to private companies and government users. The company announced the Pléiades Neo program in 2016, and Airbus assembled the Pléiades Neo spacecraft at its facility in Toulouse, France.

The four-satellite program is costing Airbus about 600 million euros, or roughly $700 million.

The Pléiades Neo satellites can produce optical imagery of Earth’s surface with a resolution of 11.8 inches, or 30 centimeters, according to Airbus. That’s good enough to resolve features such as vehicles and road markings. The first two Pléiades satellites launched more than a decade ago have 19.6-inch, or 50-centimeter, resolution.

Airbus has released imagery from the first two Pléiades Neo satellites showcasing their capabilities, picturing lava flows from volcanic eruptions, large-scale music and sports events, and views of aircraft and rockets at airports and spaceports.

The imaging resolution of Airbus’s four Pléiades Neo satellites is comparable to the resolution provided by Maxar’s six-satellite WorldView Legion surveillance satellites due to begin launching next year. The companies are competitors, providing the highest-resolution Earth observation imagery on the global commercial market.

With the help of laser inter-satellite communications links, the Pléiades Neo satellites will be able to respond rapidly to tasking requests within 30 to 40 minutes, according to Airbus.

A single Pléiades Neo satellite, using a new agile pointing capability enabled by control moment gyroscopes, can turn side-to-side to observe the same location every two days. Once all four satellites are in orbit, the constellation will be able to image any location on Earth twice a day.

Each Pléiades Neo spacecraft is designed to operate for at least 10 years. One Pléiades Neo satellite can collect images covering an area of nearly 200,000 square miles (500,000 square kilometers) every day, Airbus says.

“We are just one step away from completing this pioneering constellation, which already covers one million square kilometers per day and delivers images at 30 centimeter native resolution,” said François Lombard, head of intelligence at Airbus Defense and Space. “With this upcoming launch, we will double our capacity and be able to respond to our customers’ needs even faster, providing the best quality in the market for a wide range of military and commercial applications.”

The applications for Pléiades Neo imagery include urban planning and city management, climate change assessments, and determining the impacts of pollution. The satellites can also be tasked to assess the damage from natural disasters.

It will take about 1 hour and 44 minutes for the Vega C rocket to deploy the Pléiades Neo 5 and 6 satellites into a polar, or north-south, orbit about 385 miles (620 kilometers) above Earth.

The first stage of the Vega-C is named the P120C, an enlarged, higher-thrust, longer-burning rocket motor than the P80 first stage flown on the previous version of Vega. The P120C motor, also slated for use as a strap-on booster for Europe’s new Ariane 6 rocket, will fire for about 2 minutes and 26 seconds, generating a million pounds of thrust.

The Vega-C’s second stage, the Zefiro 40, will ignite its solid rocket motor for a two-minute firing. The Zefiro 40 produces about 293,000 pounds of thrust.

The Zefiro 9 third stage motor will ignite will 70,000 pounds of thrust, and will burn out nearly seven minutes after liftoff. The Vega C’s 10.8-foot-wide (3.3-meter) payload fairing, wider than shroud flown on past Vega rockets, will jettison during the third stage burn. The larger fairing allows larger satellites, or more small payloads, to fit into the rocket’s upper compartment.

The Vega C’s upper stage, called the AVUM+, will take over the mission to place the Pléiades Neo 5 and 6 satellites into orbit. The AVUM+ upper stage, with a Ukrainian-made liquid-fueled engine, will fire two times before deploying the Pléiades Neo 6 satellite into orbit about 56 minutes into the mission. Another burn by the upper stage main engine will position the rocket for separation of the Pléiades Neo 5 spacecraft in a slightly different orbit 1 hour and 44 minutes after liftoff.

Wing cracks continue to haunt Airbus A380 operators | - AirInsight,"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vYWlyaW5zaWdodC5jb20vd2luZy1jcmFja3MtY29udGludWUtdG8taGF1bnQtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtb3BlcmF0b3JzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Care to share?

Despite having its own extensive maintenance facilities in Dubai, Emirates recently dispatched one of its Airbus A380s to Airbus in Toulouse for “maintenance”, as it told AirInsight. But as Aviation Week reports, this maintenance has actually to do with checks and repairs of the outer wing spars for cracks. While known for three years, the issue is affecting operators now. Wing cracks continue to haunt Airbus A380 operators.

Emirates sent A380 with registration A6-EDQ to Toulouse on December 4. “This is due to our own hangar facilities in Dubai being at full capacity, with the ramp-up in flight operations and the start of our aircraft retrofit and cabin upgrade program”, a spokesperson replied to a question from AirInsight.

Indeed, Emirates started the cabin makeover on the first of 67 A380s on November 1 to install a fresh interior and Premium Economy. This program will take until early 2024 when 53 Boeing 777-300ERs will follow. The first A380 to enter refurbishment was still there today, so the work is taking up much longer than the sixteen days per aircraft that Emirates said it would take.

But the hangars of Emirates are also occupied with A380s that require inspection and repairs of the wings. According to Aviation Week, Airbus has a team of sixty engineers on site to assist the airline with this work, but there was no space left for EDQ. So she was sent to Toulouse.

Known problem since 2019

As noted in an updated EASA Airworthiness Directive dated August 31, 2022, Airbus has been aware since July 2019 of cracks forming in the wing’s outer rear spar (ORS) top and bottom flanges between ribs 33 and 79, on the outer inner front spar (OIFS) between ribs 8 and 14, and on the outer front spar (OFS) between ribs 38 and 49. The cracks could reduce the structural integrity of the wing.

Back then, Airbus issued a service bulletin for technical adaptations that covered only 25 A380s but since then it has been determined that the crack issue could be more profound on aircraft that have not received a pre-modification. “Since that AD was issued, it has been determined that additional areas may be affected by the same unsafe condition, and that all MSN must be inspected. Consequently, Airbus issued the Airbus instructions, as defined in this AD, providing applicable instructions.”

But the most significant change is that EASA has reduced the threshold for inspections from fifteen years (180 months) to 12.5 years (150 months), as cracks were identified on younger A380s as well. “That threshold might be further amended upon completion of the currently ongoing analysis.” Unrepaired areas need an inspection every 36 months.

The result is that all A380 operators need to review if their A380s need to be checked and repaired. This additional work is slowing down the re-entry into service of aircraft that have been in storage during the pandemic and is taking out capacity of aircraft in service, Emirates’ President and CEO Tim Clark told Aviation Week.

According to other sources, Emirates has brought back 92 A380s out of storage but has eight of them in maintenance and cabin overhaul. EDQ is the oldest and was delivered in October 2011, but only five of the first batch of A380s have been re-activated. Nineteen aircraft are from the latest batch with EV series of registration, twenty of the EO series are active, 24 of the EU series, and 24 of the EE series.

The oldest A380 in service right now is Qantas VH-OQB, which was delivered in December 2008. The Australian carrier is bringing more older A380s out of storage, but each aircraft gets a thorough check before one will return into service. One aircraft (OQG) left checks in Abu Dhabi on Saturday, while another (OQL) arrived on Sunday after two years of storage at Victorville near Los Angeles. Other A380 operators will also have to inspect their aircraft. Korean Air and Singapore Airlines have A380s in service that are now eleven years old.

Unrelated to the previous issue

The latest wing issue is unrelated to the one that caused headaches in 2012-2013 and forced Airbus into a multimillion repair program. This problem had to do with cracks in the so-called wing rib feet, which are tiny brackets that are part of the wing ribs. Operators were forced to check and repair the wing rib feet, which took some five weeks for each aircraft. In November 2013, cracks were found in a frame at the bottom of the wing box.

The A380 frequently is the topic of further ADs, like the one earlier this month for the inspection of door switches after corrosion was found. Other recent ADs cover belly fairing, engine pylons, landing gear, or pneumatic systems.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998427629470825}",neutral,0.9998427629470825,0
Airbus CEO details broad post-crisis industrial hurdles - Fox Business,"Thu, 08 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9lY29ub215L2FpcmJ1cy1jZW8tZGV0YWlscy1icm9hZC1wb3N0LWNyaXNpcy1pbmR1c3RyaWFsLWh1cmRsZXPSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vZWNvbm9teS9haXJidXMtY2VvLWRldGFpbHMtYnJvYWQtcG9zdC1jcmlzaXMtaW5kdXN0cmlhbC1odXJkbGVzLmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aerospace is grappling with a slower-than-expected industrial recovery from the pandemic, with disruption spreading beyond its core supply chain and exposing fragile links with other sectors, the head of the world's largest planemaker said on Thursday.

Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said the situation had also been aggravated by recent COVID restrictions leading to capacity closures in China, a major supplier.

""There is an enormous problem in bringing the industrial supply chain back to strength worldwide, in the aviation world but not only in aviation,"" Faury told French journalists.

""There is a lot of interdependence between the aerospace supply chain and electronic cards and components, raw materials and the availability of energy and skills at a worldwide level,"" Faury told the AJPAE French aerospace media association.

AIRBUS TO PUSH AHEAD WITH PRODUCTION INCREASES AS BOEING LAGS

""We see these problems spreading through the supply chain and what we, our suppliers and industrial partners ... imagined we could do at the start of the year when we built our production plans for 2022 - that didn't work out as expected.""

Ticker Security Last Change Change % EADSY AIRBUS SE 44.07 -0.58 -1.30%

Faury was speaking broadly on behalf of French companies in his role as head of aerospace association GIFAS, but the comments shed further light on supply chain problems days after Airbus abandoned a delivery target and softened an output goal.

Energy shortages weigh more heavily in Europe whereas the U.S. industry is more concerned about shortages of labor, he added. Airbus assembles some aircraft and derives a large proportion of parts from suppliers in the United States.

Airbus is now studying the impact of this on 2023 after cutting output 40% in the immediate aftermath of lockdowns and then partially resuming pre-COVID production levels.

""Getting things back into order after COVID is taking a lot longer that we thought we could reasonably do,"" Faury said.

""That doesn't mean production is not increasing - we are going up quite sharply - but it wasn't 'off-on'. We were able to cut output very strongly, very quickly that was obviously easier than getting it going again.""

TRADE WARNING

The disruption in supplies is squeezing deliveries just as demand is also picking up faster than some economists expected.

After a brisk recovery in demand for narrow-body jets like the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX families, Airbus expects stronger demand for wide-body jets in 2023 and 2024.

Faury also addressed an increase in costs, saying a recent spike in inflation was manageable if it lasted for two years, but that a longer period would cause deeper difficulties.

Handout photo released June 9, 2009, by the Brazilian Navy shows a piece of the tailfin of the Air France A330 aircraft that crashed June 1 while in flight over the Atlantic ocean.

Their guilt ""appears to us to be impossible to prove. We know that this view will most likely be difficult to hear for the civil plaintiffs, but we are not in a position to demand the conviction of Air France and Airbus,"" the public prosecutor said in court.

The two France-based companies went on trial in October to determine their responsibility for the worst aviation disaster in Air France's history, which left 228 dead on board flight AF447.

Both have denied the involuntary manslaughter charges that carry a maximum fine of 225,000 euros ($236,000).

The decision not to seek a conviction by the public prosecutor is unusual but does not mean that the three-person team of judges overseeing the trial has to follow their advice.

Prosecutors initially dropped charges against the companies in 2019 in a decision that infuriated victims' families at the time.

A Paris appeals court overturned this decision in 2021 and ordered the trial to go ahead.

""We have a prosecutor who is supposed to defend the people who in the end is defending the multinational Airbus,"" Daniele Lamy, the head of victims' association Entraide et Solidarite AF447, told reporters on Wednesday.

She denounced a ""trial skewed against the pilots"".

At the heart of eight weeks of hearings in Paris has been the role of defective so-called Pitot tubes, which are used to measure the flight speed of aircraft.

The court has heard how a malfunction with the tubes, which became blocked with ice crystals during a mid-Atlantic storm, caused alarms to sound in the cockpit of the Airbus A330 and the autopilot system to switch off.

Representatives from Airbus and Air France as well as technical experts have highlighted how the pilots put the plane into a climb after the instrument failure, causing the engines to stall.

Lawyers for victims' families emphasised how both companies were aware of the Pitot tube problem before the crash, and that the pilots were not trained to deal with a high-altitude emergency of this nature.

The defective tubes, manufactured by French company Thales, were quickly replaced on planes worldwide in the months after the accident.

The crash also prompted an overhaul of training protocols across the industry, in particular to prepare pilots to handle the intense stress of unforeseen circumstances.

Pilots are also now required to continually practise stall responses on simulators.

On October 17, lawyers and victims' families were allowed to listen to the chilling in-flight voice recording of the pilots' final minutes for the first time.

It took nearly two years to recover the ""black box"" flight recorders from the bottom of the Atlantic.

Can the Airbus-Boeing Duopoly be broken? - Finshots,"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZmluc2hvdHMuaW4vYXJjaGl2ZS9jYW4tdGhlLWFpcmJ1cy1ib2VpbmctZHVvcG9seS1iZS1icm9rZW4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In today's Finshots we talk about the Airbus-Boeing duopoly and explain how it came to be

The Story

The Tata's are really upping their ambition in the aviation sector. First, they bought Air India. Then they decided to merge Vistara with Air India. And now it seems they're buying 500 jets from Airbus and Boeing in a deal that could be worth over $100 billion.

This got us thinking - Why is the jetliner market a duopoly with just two suppliers bossing the trade? How did just two entities come to own 99% of the market?

Well, to understand this, we need to go back in time.

The story begins all the way in 1916 when Boeing began its journey as an Aero Products Company. At first, they supplied military aircraft to meet the needs of World War I. They were also ferrying mail on the side since it was quite profitable. But in 1934, the Airmail Act took force and prevented companies from manufacturing planes and delivering mail at the same. So the company had to restructure. And the Boeing Airplane Company became just ‘Boeing’ while doubling down on manufacturing commercial planes.

At the time, companies like Douglas and Lockheed were also dabbling in commercial planes. But Boeing’s 707 changed the game. It was the best plane on the market. It was fast, cost-efficient and a reliable aircraft. It dominated the market soon enough and the competition fell by the wayside. Some tried to merge operations. Some got bought out by Boeing. Lockheed for instance quit the segment altogether and began focusing on defence.

Meanwhile, Airbus emerged on the other side of the ocean. In 1970, folks in Germany, France, Britain, and Spain realized that they didn’t have enough money individually to challenge the US monopoly brought on by Boeing. So they pooled their resources and teamed up to launch Airbus. It was a pan-European effort.

It wasn’t easy in the beginning. But in 1977 the company got its first big break with the A300. Orders flew in and Airbus established itself as a force to reckon with. This also decimated the competition in Europe. Regional aircraft manufacturers like Fokker and British Aerospace (now BAE Systems) couldn’t survive the onslaught. They withdrew from commercial airline manufacturing altogether.

And by the 1990s, commercial airline manufacturing had already become the duopoly that we know today.

But the big question is — why is the jet manufacturing industry so hard to break into?

Well, let’s just say that the barriers to entry are very high. It isn’t like manufacturing cigarettes and biscuits. These are large machines that fly. And they have to fly reliably. So manufacturing companies spend billions in Research & Development alone, making sure they have everything right. Then they spend billions more in building the aircraft and perfecting it. This takes time.

A lot of time!

For instance, Airbus announced its A350 ultra-long-range flight way back in 2004. But it only launched in 2018!

And as we’ve already noted, all it takes is a big win with a new aircraft to own the market. Everybody follows the lead. And it’s hard to make a mark when there’s only one aircraft flying off the shelf.

Well, technically flying off the shelf isn’t an appropriate term. These aren’t mass-produced. Airbus and Boeing wait for orders and then start putting the planes together. They also need to set up massive manufacturing facilities to meet the growing needs of commercial aviation. For instance, despite all its experience, Airbus took over 10 years to get to a point where it could reliably produce 30 A320 jets monthly. So yeah, it’s not easy.

Also, it’s not like manufacturers can simply walk away after delivery. These are complex machines that need 24/7 support throughout their lifecycle. Remember the fanfare with which Boeing launched its 787 Dreamliner series a decade or so ago? It was supposed to change the way people flew. But then, the airline regulator discovered manufacturing defects. It asked Boeing to fix things. And that alone cost the company $2 billion.

Think about it — How many companies can invest such ludicrous sums of money and spend decades putting together an aircraft?

It’s a risky proposition and not many people want to dabble in this thing.

And you also have to remember that the large players in the industry, Airbus and Boeing, have a proven track record. Airlines trust these companies despite the odd hiccups. Sure, they don’t have many alternatives anyway, but it's always a better bet to go with an old dog as opposed to a newcomer. Especially since people’s lives are at stake every time an aircraft takes to the skies.

So it’s damn impossible for you to get a presale if you don’t already have a proven jet.

In a nutshell, you need deep, deep pockets to break into aircraft manufacturing.

But to be fair, not all this money came from their own coffers. Governments in the US and the EU have doled out plenty of subsidies to Boeing and Airbus too. They wanted their own companies to do well. And the World Trade Organization even had to look into these subsidies and make sure it wasn’t in contravention of international trade practices.

Okay, that’s all well. But duopolies aren’t great for business and competition, right? For instance, Airbus and Boeing can collude and fix prices if they really wanted to. And remember the ill-fated Boeing 737 MAX? Two aircraft crashed in late 2018 and early 2019. It killed nearly 350 people. And many people were wondering if the lack of competition had any role to play in all this.

So maybe the time is ripe for someone with deep pockets to break this duopoly.

And it seems the primary competitor is emerging from China.

After more than 10 years of working on the project and with billions of dollars of financial support, China’s very own passenger jet, manufactured by aerospace company COMAC, is ready to take to the skies. And considering the Chinese aviation market is set to become the world’s largest within the next decade, maybe they could make a dent.

As Guillaume Faury, Airbus’ CEO said and we quote, “We will probably go from a duopoly to a triopoly, at least on the single-aisle, by the end of the decade.”

Will it actually happen?

We will just have to wait and see.

Until then…

From the A350 to eyes on the stars! - Airbus,"Fri, 02 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTEyLWZyb20tdGhlLWEzNTAtdG8tZXllcy1vbi10aGUtc3RhcnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Chosen from more than 22,500 applicants, Pablo Alvarez Fernandez was selected this month as a career astronaut candidate by the European Space Agency (ESA). He currently is the Airbus Project Management Officer in Getafe, Spain for the A350 commercial aircraft, and previously worked on the ExoMars Martian rover in the UK at Airbus Defence and Space.

In the following interview, Fernández shares his excitement after becoming the first Spaniard in 30 years to be named a European astronaut, and looks ahead to next April when training begins at the ESA Astronaut Centre in Cologne, Germany.

Q: What are the next steps for you after this milestone announcement?

A: Starting next spring, I will become an ESA employee. There’s a year of basic training in Germany, and then another year of incremental training. We acquire basic knowledge of how the International Space Station works, followed by spending time in other countries, including the United States, Canada and Japan before heading back to Cologne.

After basic training, we enter the next training phase for working aboard the International Space Station, and – once assigned to a mission – the training will be tailored to my specific mission’s tasks, including the equipment and experiments. Every day spent on the International Space Station costs a lot of money and everything has to be very well organised to ensure maximum benefits are obtained from the mission.

Q: Looking to future space travel, where would you rather go: Mars or the Moon?

A: Mars is still impossible for human spaceflight. I have to go one step at a time; the first thing I need to do is complete my training. The first mission would be to the International Space Station, which is where we have the most experience and it’s safer for a rookie like me, because that’s what I am right now! After gaining more experience, astronauts are assigned to other missions.

What everyone’s talking about today is Artemis, which will put the first woman and first person of colour on the Moon in 2025. An important element of Artemis is the Orion crewed spacecraft, which is powered by the Airbus-built European Service Module – an element of pride for us.

Q: You applied under the procedure established by ESA for disabled astronauts.

A: Yes, and they selected me as a career astronaut, which is much better than I’d expected. They decided that I had a very mild disability and chose me on the same basis as other non-disabled colleagues.

Pablo Álvarez will be one of ESA’s next astronauts<br /> Airbus employee Pablo Álvarez will be joining the next class of ESA astronauts. Pablo worked as mechanical architect on the ExoMars Rover and continued his project management role in Spain while applying to become an astronaut - a lifelong dream.

Q: Do you think that humans one day will inhabit other planets?

A: Yes, I think so. We humans have something in our genes that makes us want to explore. Ever since our ancestors left Africa, we’ve always tried to go farther. We’ve also gone to the most inhospitable places on Earth, even underwater, and reached the highest mountains. We have that explorer gene. So yes, I believe that we will be on other planets, but there’s still a lot of technology to develop to make it feasible. We have to take it one step at a time.

Q: What is it about your hometown of León, Spain that breeds astronauts? Sara García Alonso, who was selected in the class of 2022 as a member of the astronaut reserve, also is from León. Something in the local jamón ""cecina"" (Spanish ham) from León, perhaps?

A: Maybe so! It’s an incredible coincidence.I hope I won’t have to miss the jamón from León when I am on the International Space Station – maybe they’ll let me take a little bit on my mission. Anyway, the astronauts are very busy, and it doesn’t seem like I’ll have much time to miss anything. Having said that, I’m sure I’ll miss plants, trees, nature and so on; it’s a very sterile environment on the International Space Station.

Q: Finally, is there anything you’re afraid of?

A: It’s mostly excitement, there’s no fear. I would be nervous about the moment of liftoff because getting inside the rocket and feeling the thrust of something like that is a bit scary. But it’s a fear that you have to learn to transform in order to be as prepared as possible.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9992690682411194}",neutral,0.9992690682411194,0

Airbus A321XLR Conducts 13-hour-long Flight – Airways - Airways Magazine,"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vYTMyMXhsci1sb25nZXN0LWV2ZXItZmxpZ2h0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DALLAS — The longest-range single-aisle aircraft from Airbus, the A321XLR, completed a test flight across Europe for more than 13 hours without stopping for fuel.

On December 13, 2022, the F-WXLR Airbus A321XLR prototype aircraft departed Toulouse-Blagnac Airport (TLS) in France to perform the longest test flight of the type to date.

Airbus conducted the flight as a part of its most recent long-range twin-jet development program, which was formally unveiled at the 2019 Paris Air Show. The program also evaluates flight control system evolutions, among other parameters.

According to Flightradar24.com, the aircraft made a circle flight across Europe in 13 hours and 15 minutes, initially heading in the direction of the UK before turning around and passing through Oslo, Berlin, Prague, Rome, Sicily, and Sardinia before landing back in Toulouse.

The A321 is expected to make it more affordable for airlines to offer longer flights when compared to the operating cost of larger twin-aisle aircraft, which have a maximum range of 4,700 nautical miles (8,700 kilometers).

The jet’s special range is made possible by a permanent Rear Center Tank, which has a fuel capacity of 12,900 liters.

Flight Testing the A321XLR

Philippe Pupin, who leads the flight test engineering team for the A321XLR program, explained back in September the rationale for the flight testing phase:

“In order to become a long-range aircraft, the A321XLR needs to carry more fuel, which means increasing the A321’s maximum take-off weight. In turn, this requires uprated landing gear and braking systems.”

The head of the program continued, “Since we are keeping the engine thrust unchanged, we have made some aerodynamic changes to retain our desired take-off performance. This has driven the physical modifications to the high-lift system – the slats and flaps – as well as reprogramming of the flight control system, all of which needs to be flight-tested and certified.”

In terms of flight hours of testing the -XLR program stands somewhere in between a brand-new aircraft and a derivative. This means Airbus has “to ‘re-test’ virtually everything regarding aircraft design and flight physics,” added Pupin.

Swiss Air-Rescue Service Rega orders 12 additional five-bladed H145s for its mountain bases - Airbus,"Mon, 05 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0xMi1zd2lzcy1haXItcmVzY3VlLXNlcnZpY2UtcmVnYS1vcmRlcnMtMTItYWRkaXRpb25hbC1maXZlLWJsYWRlZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Zürich, The Swiss Air-Rescue Service Rega has ordered a second batch of 12 five-bladed H145 helicopters to be operated from its mountain bases. They will replace the current fleet of AW109SP helicopters. This new order follows an initial contract for nine H145s, announced in March this year. By 2026, Rega will operate an all-Airbus fleet consisting of 21 five-bladed H145s.



“To effectively operate life-saving air rescue services in Switzerland, we understand that the ability to perform optimally at altitude is paramount,” says Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters. “The five-bladed H145 landed on the Aconcagua in Argentina, a mountain that is nearly 7,000 metres high - no other twin engine helicopter has ever achieved this feat. That is why we are especially proud that Rega has put its faith in the five-bladed H145 and decided to make it the only helicopter type in its fleet to perform such critical missions.”



“By selecting the five-bladed H145, we are ensuring that Rega will continue being able to provide its patients with reliable and professional medical assistance by air for the next 15 years,” says Ernst Kohler, CEO of Rega.



The five-bladed H145s will come equipped with a state-of-the-art navigation system, especially tailored to the operator’s needs that will enhance the mission capabilities and the safety of operations. The system will use new capabilities of the Flight Management System GTN750 Xi by Garmin. It will integrate and control a multi-sensor system that provides highly accurate and reliable navigation capacities. Even in the event of GPS signal loss, the helicopter will navigate safely thanks to Thales’ inertial navigation system. This solution will further boost the navigation performance in low IFR conditions and allows the helicopter to be certified as navigation procedure RNP-AR 0.1, which is the most accurate navigation procedure in the helicopter environment. The configuration also includes a new hoist by Vincorion that is being certified on the five-bladed H145, ensuring highest safety standards.



Rega operates 14 HEMS stations in Switzerland. Last year, the helicopter crews carried out 14,330 missions, including transporting 471 COVID patients.



The new version of Airbus’ best-selling H145 light twin-engine helicopter adds a new, innovative five-bladed rotor to the multi-mission aircraft, increasing the useful load of the helicopter by 150kg. The simplicity of the new bearingless main rotor design also eases maintenance operations, further improving the benchmark serviceability and reliability of the H145, while improving ride comfort for both passengers and crew. In total, there are more than 1,600 H145 family helicopters in service, logging a total of more than seven million flight hours. Powered by two Safran Arriel 2E engines, the H145 is equipped with full authority digital engine control (FADEC) and the Helionix digital avionics suite. It includes a high performance 4-axis autopilot, increasing safety and reducing pilot workload. Its particularly low acoustic footprint makes the H145 the quietest helicopter in its class, while its CO2 emissions are the lowest amongst its competitors.

Airbus expansion making Mobile a global epicenter for the aerospace… - 1819 News,"Mon, 05 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vMTgxOW5ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvaXRlbS9tb2JpbGUtaXMtcXVpY2tseS1iZWNvbWluZy1hLWdsb2JhbC1lcGljZW50ZXItZm9yLXRoZS1hZXJvc3BhY2UtaW5kdXN0cnnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On Monday, Airbus and state and local government officials held a community event at Bishop State Community College outlining Airbus’s massive expansion at its Mobile facility. The addition of a third final assembly line at the company’s Brookley Aeroplex facility will create another 1,000 jobs in the Mobile area.

Airbus has announced plans to increase production of its A320 Family of single-aisle passenger aircraft. The new 350,000 square-foot final assembly line in Mobile is part of those plans.

“The fact that Mobile will lead our unprecedented global production rate increase in coming years is a tribute to the world-class labor force in Alabama,” said C. Jeffrey Knittel, chairman and CEO of Airbus Americas.

“I’m so proud of our Mobile employees for proving through years of hard work what Alabama is capable of, and I’m also immensely grateful to state leadership for making Alabama such a great place to invest and do business.”

Greg Canfield, the Secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce, said that the state’s aerospace/aviation industry is primed for growth. During 2021, companies within the sector announced new investments totaling $220 million in projects expected to create 667 jobs, Commerce data indicate.

“Aerospace industry growth continues to be a high-value opportunity for Alabama, not only in terms of capital investment but also in job creation,” said Canfield. “There are a lot of exciting things going on in aerospace and aviation in the state, and we’re seeing that today with the expansion at Airbus.”

Ed Castile is the director of AIDT, a division of the Alabama Department of Commerce that provides customized technical training programs at no cost to employers and to the trainees.

Castile explained that in order to facilitate Airbus’ ambitious hiring plans, Alabama workforce development and education organizations are collaborating on new recruitment and training initiatives to build out the jobs pipeline.

“Airbus has been an extraordinary partner as we work together daily to help change people’s lives,” said Castile. “Airbus provides incredible career opportunities, and we have the awesome opportunity to help them find their team and assist with training.”

Castile said that AIDT plans to expand its Aviation Training Center at the Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley, a 36,500-square-foot facility that opened in 2014 specifically to help Airbus get production up and running.

Alabama Governor Kay Ivey lauded the expansion.

“It’s wonderful to see Airbus continue to grow its only U.S. airliner manufacturing operation with another expansion in Mobile,” Ivey said. “This growth is made possible by the company’s skilled workforce in Alabama and our commitment to developing a pipeline of future aerospace workers.”

David Rodgers is the vice president of economic development at the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce.

“Mobile is quickly becoming a global epicenter for the aerospace industry, and the addition of a third final assembly line in Mobile is a testament to our area’s workforce,” said Rodgers.

During Monday’s event at Bishop State Community College, Airbus outlined its plan to ramp up production of aircraft. The additional final assembly line will add 1,000 new jobs over the next several years to its workforce at the Mobile manufacturing facility. Around 1,200 workers are already employed by Airbus in Mobile.

Airbus has already invested over $1 billion in its Alabama manufacturing facility.

Economic developer Dr. Nicole Jones told 1819 News, “Airbus is a global pioneer in aerospace and aviation. The company has announced a series of expansions over the years that have shown the world how Alabama is a leader in the industry and, specifically, in the production of commercial aircraft. This is a testament to teamwork, strategic partnerships and workforce development efforts between the public and private sector. Alabama’s business climate is conducive for growth.”

Castile said that AIDT is also expanding apprenticeship programs and supporting Airbus training initiatives at Flight Works Alabama, including FlightPath9, We Build It Better and aviation dual enrollment at area schools.

Flight Works Alabama is an aerospace education center located near the Airbus facility that aims to inspire future aviation workers across the Mobile region. The 15,000-square-foot facility features more than 40 high-tech exhibits. It opened in August 2020. Flight Works also directs the FlightPath9 program that targets high school seniors in the Mobile community with a desire to work in aerospace. We Build It Better is an innovative learning program that provides classroom kits and interactive techniques designed to help instructors expand students’ creative capacity and encourage discoveries.

“We see Airbus as the ‘tip of the spear’ with its Alabama location and its continued growth as a powerful catalyst for an expansion of the aerospace industry in our state,” said Castile. “This Airbus expansion simply highlights that Alabama is open for business and a great place to work and raise a family.”

Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson said on social media, “Exciting news today for Airbus and City of Mobile! The future is bright for #FlightPath9 and can be for you too! #JoinTeamAirbus.”

Airbus produced the first Alabama-built A320 aircraft in 2015, during the administration of Gov. Robert Bentley (R). In 2019, it launched production of the A220 single-aisle passenger jet in Mobile with its own dedicated second final assembly line.

The C919, built by the Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC), is a rival of Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX aircraft families. The airplane was certified for safe operations in September and mass production in November.

China Eastern Airlines has ordered five C919 planes. It said it expects to receive the remaining four aircraft over the next two years. The C919 is scheduled to begin commercial operation in early 2023 with a maiden flight from Shanghai to Beijing.

The C919 delivered today has 164 seats, including eight in business class. China Eastern Airlines previously disclosed the aircraft cost $99 million, comparable to similar passenger jets sold by Airbus and Boeing.

China’s four largest airlines operate a total of about 2,200 Airbus and Boeing planes, according to Bloomberg. This summer, the Chinese government ordered 292 passenger jets from Airbus for three state-owned airlines. It’s the largest order Airbus has ever sold.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999645948410034}",neutral,0.9999645948410034,0
Video: Airbus launches loyal wingman combat drone out of a carrier - New Atlas,"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL21pbGl0YXJ5L2FpcmJ1cy1yZW1vdGUtY2Fycmllci1kcm9uZS1sYXVuY2gtbG95YWwtd2luZ21hbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Next-generation fighter jets will go into combat with semi-autonomous wingman drones designed to act as force multipliers. Here's one in development: Airbus has just dropped its Remote Carrier demonstrator out of a cargo plane, for a mid-air launch.

This test forms part of Europe's Future Combat Air System (FCAS) program, which will team sixth-generation fighter jets up with swarms of highly automated but remote-piloted uncrewed aircraft to create co-ordinated chaos in the skies. These stealth drones will be kitted up with mission-specific payloads and armaments, for air-to-air, air-to-ground, recon, intelligence and electronic warfare scenarios.

Much smaller and cheaper than fighter jets, they're viewed as expendable assets, so they won't have the same long-range flight capabilities as, for example, Australia's Ghost Bat loyal wingman drones. So a key part of the FCAS plan is to get these Remote Carrier drones into the theater of battle via large military transports like the A400M Atlas. One Atlas will be able to drop as many as 50 small Remote Carriers close to their destination – or 12 larger ""heavy"" Remote Carriers.

And here we see the launch procedure in full for the first time. The demonstrator drone being tested is not the final Remote Carrier design; it's actually a modified Airbus Do-DT25 aerial target drone. But the launch procedure is the same: the drone is ejected from the cargo bay of the A400M, under remote control by a pilot on board the plane. Once clear of the transport plane, its jet engines are powered up and started.

At this point, the aerial team hands over control of the powered-up UAV to a ground-based remote pilot, who takes it off on a separate mission before landing it at an airstrip. You can see the operation in the video below.

Remote Carrier demonstrator released and operated from flying A400M for the first time

Meanwhile, the US Air Force is working on its own ways of delivering lethal force using large cargo planes. Its Rapid Dragon system, described as a ""bomb bay in a box,"" is a pallet full of precision munitions that gets dropped out of the cargo bay of unmodified C-17 or C-130 Hercules transports on a parachute.

As it floats downward, it launches whatever nasties it's carrying, which fire downward and away from the chute before establishing control and heading off on whatever autonomous or remote-piloted mission they're slated for.

The USAF has already demonstrated the system in a live fire exercise. Last month, it used the Rapid Dragon system to launch a Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile in Norway. Video of this live fire event is available at the Air Force website, but the system is better explained in the render video below.

FAA sets design requirements for Airbus A321XLR tank | - AirInsight,"Thu, 08 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vYWlyaW5zaWdodC5jb20vZmFhLXNldHMtZGVzaWduLXJlcXVpcmVtZW50cy1mb3ItYWlyYnVzLWEzMjF4bHItdGFuay_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Care to share?

UPDATE – The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has set design requirements for one of the unique features of the Airbus A321XLR: the Rear Center Tank (RCT). Reuters reports today that the FAA has formulated special conditions in an advisory circular as part of the public consultation procedure for the A321XLR. FAA sets design requirements for Airbus A321XLR tank.

The Rear Center Tank has been the topic of much debate after some – notably Boeing – raised concerns about its safety. Thanks to the 12.900 liters in the RCT, the A321XLR has a range of 4.700 nautical miles/8.700 kilometers. The concerns focus on the safety of the tank, which is positioned just aft of the main landing gear in the belly hold. Critics said that the close proximity to the landing gear could pose a risk in case of a gear failure and penetration. The RCT’s position right under the cabin floor is another concern. After the FAA published the Notice of Proposed Special Conditions for the A321XLR in April, Boeing filed four comments about the safety of the tank. These have been reviewed and resulted into the Advisory Circular, which will become rule from January 5.

‘This tank design was not envisaged by FAA’

The FAA Advisory Circular of December 6 offers more insight into the debate about safety. In the document, the FAA says that “the fuel tank will be “integral” to the airplane, in that its walls will be part of the airplane structure. The exterior skin of the airplane fuselage will constitute part of the walls of the fuel tank, and these areas will lack the thermal/acoustic insulation that usually lines the exterior skin of an airplane fuselage. This design was not envisaged by the FAA’s regulatory requirements for insulation installations on transport-category airplanes. Regulation 14 CFR 25.856 (b) requires all thermal/acoustic insulation in the lower half of the airplane fuselage and their installation to comply with the flame penetration resistance (…) to raise the level of post-crash fire safety on transport category airplanes.”

As a consequence, “the FAA will require that the lower half of the airplane fuselage, spanning the longitudinal area of the tank, be resistant to fire penetration. “Resistant to fire penetration” will, for this special condition, mean that this area provides fire penetration resistance equivalent to the resistance which would be provided if the fuselage were lined with thermal/acoustic insulation that meets the flame penetration resistance test requirements.”

According to the FAA, Airbus has stated that “its design does not allow for compliant thermal/acoustic insulation to be placed beneath the cabin floor. This large volume of unheated liquid (fuel), directly below the floor of the passenger cabin, would, without mitigation, create a ‘cold feet’ effect for the passengers above it. Therefore, Airbus will install insulation panels between the fuel tank and the cabin floor, for comfort reasons. (…) Airbus states that it is technically not feasible to install thermal/acoustic insulation that complies with regulation §25.856(b), due to the lack of space in this area and the need to keep nearby decompression panels free of blockages and ensure adequate ventilation.”

In one of its comments, Boeing requested that the special conditions require the RCT fire penetration resistance capability to be equivalent to the capability provided by the wing box area, where additional fuel tanks are usually positioned. Boeing said that “the FAA’s proposed standard of fire penetration resistance equivalent to that of a fuselage lined with thermal/acoustic insulation that meets the flame penetration resistance test requirements does not address hazards associated with fuel tanks and is not applicable to the wing box area.” The FAA rejected this suggestion, stating that “these special conditions are not intended to ensure the RCT is constructed to provide a fire penetration resistance capability that is similar to that of the wing box area.”

Constant dialogue

Airbus has been in constant dialogue with the European regulatory agency EASA about the RCT for over three years, but neither the airframer nor the agency is willing to say if this dialogue has resulted in design changes or other modifications to the tank. Head of Program, Gary O’Donnell, said on the occasion of the XLR’s first flight on June 15 that the RCT will be closely monitored during the flight test program, which currently includes three test aircraft. Earlier this year, Airbus pushed the certification of the XLR out by some months until early 2024 following “certification requirements” from regulators. One of its main customers, Air Lease Corporation (ALC) Chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy, told AirInsight in June that the lessor has also suggested various modifications to Airbus to make the tank safer.

One of the options to improve the protection of the tank is by adding a Kevlar lining around the aluminum tank. The weight penalty of this lightweight material could be limited, which is crucial because every extra kilogram will eat into the maximum range of the A321XLR. This is not in the interest of Airbus, as the extended range is the type’s unique selling point to which Boeing has no answer with the MAX family. The A321XLR has won over 500 orders. Entry into service is not expected before the second quarter of 2024.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9982965588569641}",neutral,0.9982965588569641,0

Speaking at the Airbus Summit 2022 event in Munich today, Michael Schoellhorn, chief executive of Airbus Defence & Space, said the project to diversify away from Russian sources was “in full swing”.

“Clearly the aim is to not be dependant on Russian titanium,” he says. “We are in the process of decoupling from Russian sources.”

The defence business has already eliminated Russian titanium and the same point will be reached in the commercial unit in a “matter of months not years”, he says.

However, Schoellhorn notes the “relatively complex process” of certificating new suppliers given the aerospace industry’s strict regulations. “But it will happen,” he says.

Airbus has previously called on the EU not to implement sanctions on Russian titanium suppliers, arguing that it would harm the bloc’s aerospace industry without hurting Russia’s economy.

Airbus sources most of its titanium from VSMPO-Avisma, part of Russian industrial conglomerate Rostec.

Schoellhorn says the invasion of Ukraine by Russia has forced European manufacturers to re-evaluate their supply chains to ensure more resilience.

He says nations must also do the same when buying defence equipment in order to “not make ourselves dependent unilaterally on one source or one power.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9975380897521973}",neutral,0.9975380897521973,0

Two Pléiades Neo Earth-imaging satellites lost in failure of Europe's Vega C rocket – Spaceflight Now - Spaceflight Now,"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VmbGlnaHRub3cuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMjEvdHdvLXBsZWlhZGVzLW5lby1lYXJ0aC1pbWFnaW5nLXNhdGVsbGl0ZXMtbG9zdC1pbi1mYWlsdXJlLW9mLWV1cm9wZXMtdmVnYS1jLXJvY2tldC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"EDITOR’S NOTE: Updated at 12 p.m. EST (1700 GMT) with details from news conference.

The final two spacecraft in Airbus’s four-satellite, 600 million-euro commercial Pléiades Neo Earth observation fleet crashed into the Atlantic Ocean shortly after launch from French Guiana Tuesday night, falling victim to a failure of a European Vega C rocket.

The Vega C rocket’s launch operator, Arianespace, confirmed the mission failed to place the two Pléiades Neo optical imaging satellites into orbit. The preliminary focus of the failure investigation centered on the Vega C rocket’s second stage.

The 114-foot-tall (34.8-meter) rocket lifted off from the Guiana Space Center at 8:47:31 p.m. EST Tuesday (0147:31 GMT Wednesday) with the Pléiades Neo 5 and 6 Earth-imaging satellites for Airbus Defense and Space. The target was a polar sun-synchronous orbit.

The Vega C’s powerful solid-fueled P120C first stage booster burned nearly two-and-a-half minutes, producing a million pounds of thrust to accelerate the rocket into the upper atmosphere. Heading north from the South American coastline, the rocket shed its spent first stage motor casing and fired a second stage Zefiro 40 motor to continue the climb into space.

But Arianespace officials said the rocket ran into trouble soon after the start of the Zefiro 40 motor firing.

“After the liftoff and the nominal ignition of P120C, which is the first stage of the Vega, an underpressure has been observed on the Zefiro 40, which is the second stage of the Vega,” said Stéphane Israël, Arianespace’s CEO. “And after this underpressure, we have observed a deviation of the trajectory and a very strong anomaly. Unfortunately, we can say that the mission is lost.”

Telemetry showed a “progressive decrease” the chamber pressure in the Zefiro 40 solid rocket motor beginning about seven seconds after it ignited, following a good burn by the P120C first stage motor, said Pierre-Yves Tissier, Arianespace’s chief technical officer, in a press briefing Wednesday. The chamber pressure suddenly dropped at about T+plus 3 minutes, 28 seconds, about two-thirds of the way through the Zefiro 40’s planned burn.

Tissier said Wednesday that range safety officials at the Guiana Space Center sent a destruct command to the rocket when it veered off its planned course.

“I want to deeply apologize to our customer, Pléiades Neo and Airbus Defense and Space, for this failure tonight,” Israël said Tuesday night. “And we will now have to work with all our partners to better understand why the Zefiro 40 has not worked properly tonight, triggering the failure of the mission.”

Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Israël said a preliminary look at the data from the Vega C launch failure shows no impact on Europe’s Ariane 5 and Ariane 6 rockets. There are two flights of the workhorse Ariane 5 rocket remaining to launch next year before Europe moves on to the Ariane 6, which is scheduled to debut in late 2023. The Ariane 6 rocket shares the P120C solid rocket motor design with the Vega C, but so far, the investigation shows the failure Tuesday night was limited to the Zefiro 40 second stage.

An inquiry chaired by Arianespace’s chief technical officer and the inspector general of the European Space Agency will investigate the root cause of the Vega C launch failure.

The Zefiro 40 second stage, like the Vega C’s other solid-fueled booster stages, is produced by the rocket’s prime contractor, the Italian aerospace company Avio. The second stage motor is designed to burn its supply of 40 tons (36 metric tons) of pre-packed solid propellant in about 90 seconds.

The Vega C rocket replaces the old Vega rocket’s solid-fueled first and second stages with wider, heavier motor casings. The third stage motor is unchanged, and the restartable liquid-fueled fourth stage has the same type of engine but carries more propellant. The upgraded Vega C is taller than the original Vega rocket configuration, and has a larger payload fairing provided by the Swiss company Beyond Gravity, formerly known as RUAG Space.

The wider Zefiro 40 second stage on the Vega C rocket replaces the Zefiro 23 motor on the basic model of the Vega rocket, adding 50% more solid propellant and generating 293,000 pounds of thrust.

The launch Tuesday night was the first commercial flight of Europe’s upgraded Vega C rocket, following the Vega C’s flawless inaugural test flight July 13.

Here’s the statement from Stéphane Israël, Arianespace’s CEO, confirming an “underpressure” was detected on the Vega C rocket’s second stage Zefiro 40 motor, causing the failure of tonight’s launch with Airbus’s Pléiades Neo 5 and 6 satellites. https://t.co/rUACF3jhhj pic.twitter.com/9gGdpJs9OV — Spaceflight Now (@SpaceflightNow) December 21, 2022

Europe’s Vega rocket family has now suffered three failures in 22 flights. The three failures have occurred on the Vega rocket’s last eight launches, following 14 straight successful flights since the Vega launcher entered service in 2012.

Investigators blamed a 2019 launch mishap on a “thermo-structural failure” on the Vega rocket’s Zefiro 23 second stage. A 2020 launch failure was traced to misplaced cables on the Vega rocket’s liquid-fueled upper stage, called the Attitude and Vernier Upper Module.

The Vega rocket had amassed four straight successful launches, including the debut of the Vega C, before Tuesday night’s doomed mission.

The satellites lost on the Vega C rocket were the third and fourth spacecraft in a quartet of Airbus-built and -owned Earth observation satellites. The first two Pléiades Neo satellites launched in 2021 on separate Vega rockets, but Airbus put the third and fourth spacecraft of the constellation on the same mission to take advantage of the Vega C rocket’s heavier carrying capacity.

The Pléiades Neo satellites feature improvements over Airbus’s two first-generation Pléiades Earth observation satellites launched in 2011 and 2012. Airbus says it entirely funded the development of the Pléiades Neo satellites, with intentions to sell the imagery commercially to private companies and government users. The company announced the Pléiades Neo program in 2016, and Airbus assembled the Pléiades Neo spacecraft at its facility in Toulouse, France.

The four-satellite program was expected to cost Airbus about 600 million euros, or roughly $700 million. An Airbus spokesperson said Wednesday the Pléiades Neo satellites lost in the launch failure were insured.

The Pléiades Neo satellites can produce optical imagery of Earth’s surface with a resolution of 11.8 inches, or 30 centimeters, according to Airbus. That’s good enough to resolve features such as vehicles and road markings. The first two Pléiades satellites launched more than a decade ago have 19.6-inch, or 50-centimeter, resolution.

Airbus has released imagery from the first two Pléiades Neo satellites showcasing their capabilities, picturing lava flows from volcanic eruptions, large-scale music and sports events, and views of aircraft and rockets at airports and spaceports.

The imaging resolution of Airbus’s four Pléiades Neo satellites is comparable to the resolution provided by Maxar’s six-satellite WorldView Legion surveillance satellites due to begin launching next year. The companies are competitors, providing the highest-resolution Earth observation imagery on the global commercial market.

With the help of laser inter-satellite communications links, the Pléiades Neo satellites will be able to respond rapidly to tasking requests within a half-hour, according to Airbus.

A single Pléiades Neo satellite, using a new agile pointing capability enabled by control moment gyroscopes, can turn side-to-side to observe the same location every two days. Once all four satellites are in orbit, the constellation will be able to image any location on Earth twice a day.

Each Pléiades Neo spacecraft is designed to operate for at least 10 years. One Pléiades Neo satellite can collect images covering an area of nearly 200,000 square miles (500,000 square kilometers) every day, Airbus says.

The applications for Pléiades Neo imagery include urban planning and city management, climate change assessments, and determining the impacts of pollution. The satellites can also be tasked to assess the damage from natural disasters, and the imagery also has military applications.

The Vega C rocket aimed to deploy the Pléiades Neo 5 and 6 satellites into a polar, or north-south, orbit about 385 miles (620 kilometers) above Earth.

Europe’s Vega rocket family is designed to carry small to medium-size satellites into orbit. Developed in partnership between Avio and the European Space Agency, the upgraded Vega C rocket is capable of hauling up to 5,070 pounds (2.3 metric tons) of payload mass to a 435-mile-high (700-kilometer) polar orbit, an increase over the 3,300-pound (1.5-metric ton) capacity of the basic model of the Vega rocket.

ESA and the European Commission reached an agreement with Arianespace last month to launch five satellites for Europe’s Copernicus Earth observing system on Vega C rockets. The new deal increased Arianespace’s backlog to 15 Vega missions, including 13 Vega C missions and two more launches with the original Vega rocket configuration.

EASA sides with FAA design requirements for Airbus A321XLR tank - AeroTime,"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvZWFzYS1zaWRlcy13aXRoLWZhYS1kZXNpZ24tcmVxdWlyZW1lbnRzLWZvci1haXJidXMtYTMyMXhsci10YW5r0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWVyb3RpbWUuYWVyby9hcnRpY2xlcy9lYXNhLXNpZGVzLXdpdGgtZmFhLWRlc2lnbi1yZXF1aXJlbWVudHMtZm9yLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIxeGxyLXRhbmsvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has sided with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in its request for design adjustments to be made to the body of Airbus A321XLR aircraft.

The European regulator insisted that design changes be made to the A321XLR Rear Center Tank (RCT), arguing that the tank would need to be redesigned to avoid serious fire risks that could occur in the event of a survivable crash.

“EASA identified the need to prescribe special detailed technical specifications (named Special Conditions) to ensure adequate occupants protection against the risks of external fire and burnthrough, fuel vapour ignition and fuel tank explosion as well to ensure crashworthiness of this fuel tank so that no fuel is released in sufficient quantities so to start a serious fire in an otherwise survivable crash event,” the EASA document released on December 8, 2022, reads.

According to the agency, the fuel tank should be installed in a specific aircraft fuselage area “that is not likely to fail or rupture in a survivable crash condition exceeding the applicable existing emergency landing conditions”.

The European regulator also suggested that Airbus consider including some additional fuselage design features, such as a bladder and crushable structure, which could “mitigate the effects of impact and scraping on the ground, including contact with obstacles”.

EASA’s document follows a request from the FAA issued to Airbus asking the planemaker to make some modifications to the fuselage of the A321XLR. Since the RTC tank is located at the lower fuselage area, which partially replaces the rear cargo compartment in comparison to older generation planes, the FAA said Airbus will need to lower half of the fuselage near the longitudinal RCT area.

As per the FAA’s request, the area should be made fire-resistant, diminishing potential safety risks to passengers.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9979938268661499}",neutral,0.9979938268661499,0

DALLAS – SWISS International Air Lines (LX) is set to welcome five Airbus A350-900s to its fleet come 2025 onwards. The twin jets will gradually replace LX’s older four-engined Airbus A340-300s and be deployed on its intercontinental network from its Zurich (ZRH) Hub.

For the Lufthansa Group-owned airline, it’s a major step in its fleet modernization and a significant part of its sustainability roadmap.

Airline Comments

“We are very pleased to have achieved our turnaround after the coronavirus crisis and be back on a sound financial track,” said the airline’s CEO Dieter Vranckx.

“As a result of this, we are now in a position to invest again in the future of our company, in our people and in the quality that we offer our travelling guests. With this planned substantial modernization of our long-haul aircraft fleet, we are setting a vital course to sustainably maintain our competitive edge over the longer term.

“Our decision to acquire the Airbus A350-900 is a clear commitment to further enhancing the sustainability of our flight operations. Our new long-haul twinjet will play a substantial part in achieving our ambitious climate goals. And in adding this latest-generation aircraft to our fleet, with all the additional inflight comfort it will provide for our guests, we are also further confirming our position as a premium air carrier.”

A Decision that Favored the A350

The airline had analyzed deeply whether the A350 or the Boeing 787 would be the right fit. One of the most prominent reasons for the final choice fell upon the A350s wider fuselage and cabin, as LX wished to retain its first-class cabin. At present, five A340-300s fly for the carrier, and upon their departure from 2025 onwards, one of them is destined to join sister airline Edelweiss (WK).

In the longer term, more A350s will likely join the airline and replace the fourteen A330-300s that will remain operational until 2030. The carrier also has twelve relatively new Boeing 777-300ER jets that will remain part of the intercontinental fleet for years.

After Rolls- Royce announced it was testing out hydrogen-powered jets that could one day power regional aircraft, Airbus decided it wanted to hop on the hydrogen hype train as well. The European plane maker will soon start testing a hydrogen fuel cell-powered engine that could power plans of the future.

Airbus announced this week that it will begin ground and air testing of its new fuel cell engine architecture, which could be used to power zero-emission aircraft by 2035. With its new hydrogen-fueled architecture, Airbus is targeting a range of 1,000 nautical miles and capacity to power a plane that can fit “one hundred passengers.”

The fuel cells will convert hydrogen into electricity in order to power a propeller engine. Airbus added that a hydrogen gas turbine could also be added to the system to create a hybrid-electric architecture.

“Fuel cells are a potential solution to help us achieve our zero-emission ambition and we are focused on developing and testing this technology to understand if it is feasible and viable for a 2035 entry-into-service of a zero-emission aircraft,” said Glenn Llewellyn, vice president of zero-emission aircraft at Airbus.

“By continuing to invest in this technology we are giving ourselves additional options that will inform our decisions on the architecture of our future ZEROe aircraft, the development of which we intend to launch in the 2027-2028 timeframe.”

Airbus will soon begin testing the new power plant on modified A380 super jumbo. The aircraft, which went out of production last year and has slowly been retired by many global airlines, will begin its new life as an airborne lab for Airbus.

The European plane maker will transform the first A380 to ever roll off the production line into a test bed for future power plants. To do this, the plane is currently being outfitted with hydrogen tanks in its rear quarter and mounts that can hold prototype engines.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996820688247681}",neutral,0.9996820688247681,0

Doing an optimized flight on the Airbus A350-900 | - AirInsight,"Thu, 01 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vYWlyaW5zaWdodC5jb20vZG9pbmctYW4tb3B0aW1pemVkLWZsaWdodC1vbi10aGUtYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtOTAwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Care to share?

Part of the 2022 Airbus Summit was a transfer flight on November 30 from Toulouse to Munich in order to get the media party and Airbus staff to Germany for Day 2. For this flight, A350-900 test aircraft MSN002 Airspace Explorer was used and it performed an optimized flight between the two airports. Doing an optimized flight on the Airbus A350-900.

MSN002 has a fully equipped cabin, yet, it has numerous experimental features. One of the latest updates is the installation of the New Production Standard sidewalls that increase cabin width by four inches, allowing for a ten-abreast seat configuration in Economy Class. Although the tenth seat was absent from the aircraft, the new panels were there. Placed right next to the original version, the difference between the two was visible. The new one is less curved and almost looks like the straight sidewalls on an A380.

Airbus is offering the ten-abreast configuration to customers, but so far, no airline has selected this option. But the wider cabin is already on the newest A350s that were delivered recently to Iberia and Starlux.

002 also has a vast range of different seats, with many variants in the different classes in both Business and Economy Class. They are all there to be tried and tested by Airbus and potential customers. Some seats have new IFE screens and systems. The flexible, slim screens that we saw on the same aircraft last year were absent from this flight, but the Diehl projectors that project images and scenes on the luggage bins and ceiling are still there. This product is also offered to customers but has not been selected by one yet.

Sporty take-off

Flight AIB359 to Munich used an optimized flight trajectory. First, the aircraft used single-engine taxiing from the Airbus Delivery Center in Toulouse to the runway to save fuel. The take-off itself at 5.59 pm local time in the southeastern direction was quite ‘sporty’, with a short take-off roll for the light aircraft at full thrust of the Rolls-Royce XWB-84s. We did a left turn that brought us in a northeast direction, in which we did Continuous Climb Operations steep climb to FL390, passing Lyon, Geneva, and Bern on the way into Munich.

Close to Bayeried and some fifteen minutes before the landing, we started our continuous descent approach (CDA). The descent was indeed continuous, although it seemed that at some time, we were leveling off for a short while. The A350 came straight in at Munich Airport at 7.17 pm and taxied to the gate on a single engine again, only to find its original parking space being taken up by another aircraft…

The flight, which used various air traffic control procedures from the Albatross project from Eurocontrol, is said to have saved some 35 percent of fuel compared to a ‘traditional’ flight.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999874830245972}",neutral,0.9999874830245972,0
