Airbus presents a panoramic view of 2050 - Airbus,"Tue, 14 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxMS0wNi1haXJidXMtcHJlc2VudHMtYS1wYW5vcmFtaWMtdmlldy1vZi0yMDUw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

Intelligent cabin interiors replace class system for a bespoke flying experience

Leading aircraft manufacturer Airbus, in advance of the Paris Airshow “Le Bourget”, today invited the passengers of 2050 to discover its Concept Cabin - a whole new flying experience inspired by nature.

Personalised zones replace traditional cabin classes to offer tailored levels of experience. While taking a hop between destinations, according to Airbus, passengers in 2050 could join an interactive conference; enjoy a game of virtual golf; read the kids back home a bedtime story; and recharge in a ‘vitalising seat’ whilst watching the planet spread out beneath their feet.

This latest instalment of The Future by Airbus – a vision of aviation in 2050 – follows last year’s unveiling of the revolutionary Airbus Concept Plane, packed with technologies to reduce fuel burn, emissions, waste and noise. The Airbus Concept Cabin now gives further insight into some of the innovations and technologies that will shape future passenger experiences on board.

The aircraft’s bionic structure mimics the efficiency of bird bone which is optimised to provide strength where needed, and allows for an intelligent cabin wall membrane which controls air temperature and can become transparent to give passengers open panoramic views.

The Concept Cabin has an integrated ‘neural network’ creating an intelligent interface between passenger and plane. It can identify and respond to passenger needs and enables bespoke features such as morphing seats which change to your body shape.

New personalised zones replace the traditional cabin classes in the Airbus Concept Cabin to offer new tailored levels of experience. The “vitalising zone” is all about wellbeing and relaxation allowing you to proactively recharge your batteries with vitamin and antioxidant enriched air, mood lighting, aromatherapy and acupressure treatments whilst taking in the infinite view of the world around you.

There are no limits to the kinds of social scenarios in the centre zone of the concept cabin – the “interactive zone”. The virtual pop up projections in this area can transform you to whichever social scene you want to be in, from holographic gaming to virtual changing rooms for active shoppers.

The “smart tech zone” is tailored towards the more functional oriented passenger with a chameleon style offering, to meet individual needs ranging from a simple to a complete luxury service, but all allowing you to continue life as if on the ground. By offering different levels of experience within each zone, airlines would be able to achieve price differentials and give more people access to the benefits of air travel with minimal environmental impact.

Showcasing the innovative interior design, Charles Champion, Airbus Executive Vice President Engineering, said: “Our research shows that passengers of 2050 will expect a seamless travel experience while also caring for the environment. The Airbus Concept Cabin is designed with that in mind, and shows that the journey can be as much a voyage of discovery as the destination. Whichever flight experience is chosen, the passenger of 2050 will step out of the Airbus Concept Cabin feeling revitalised and enriched.”

More than 90 percent of Airbus’ annual research & development investment of over €2 billion has environmental benefits for current and future aircraft. For example, due to advances in technologies the concept cabin will be 100% recyclable. It will have self-cleaning materials made from sustainable plant fibres which reduce waste and maintenance and will harvest passenger body heat to power cabin features.

Such technologies are already being developed and, while they may not be seen in the exact same manner as in the Airbus Concept Plane and Cabin, some of them could feature in future Airbus aircraft programmes.

Visitors to Le Bourget International Airshow in Paris will also be able to experience the Airbus’ Future of Flight film, a 360 planetarium movie – a vision of the transformations in air transport between now and the middle of the century which not only focuses on aircraft designs and innovations, but also addresses passenger expectations. The movie will be part of the planetarium’s programme at the Musee de l’Air et de l’Espace from 20 – 26 June.

Not surprisingly, Airbus has yet to comment on the report, which one would classify either as a leak, if true, or a rumor, if not. The new model reportedly will seat as many as 1,000 passengers in an economy-only configuration but probably only a friendly 700 or so in the standard layout. Airbus has already announced the development of the 900-passenger A380-900, with launch customers ready to take delivery in 2014. While the -900 will be huge, it won’t be the biggest airplane in the world. That distinction belongs to a different type altogether.

The Antonov AN-225, a Russian transport of which there exists only one example, is the largest in terms of length and wingspan, though a thousand-passenger A380 would likely equal or slightly surpass the AN-225 in both regards. Air France and Virgin reportedly are both interested in a larger A380, citing economies of scale, and several Middle East and Pacific Rim airlines are eyeing the 900 model for long-haul all-economy flights that would expand their markets and improve their margins."
"Paris 2011: Republic places neo order for Frontier, CSeries order remains | CAPA - CAPA - Centre for Aviation","Wed, 22 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vY2VudHJlZm9yYXZpYXRpb24uY29tL2FuYWx5c2lzL3JlcG9ydHMvcGFyaXMtMjAxMS1yZXB1YmxpYy1wbGFjZXMtbmVvLW9yZGVyLWZvci1mcm9udGllci1jc2VyaWVzLW9yZGVyLXJlbWFpbnMtNTQyMDDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This order is part of a deal, as with pilots, to renegotiate current contracts but it remains interesting since Republic/Frontier has also ordered 40 Bombardier CSeries for delivery in 2016, making it the US launch customer. It also optioned another 40. The airline was quick to nix speculation that the 40 A319neos and the 40 A320neos would replace the CSeries orders, telling Reuters the CSeries order remains in place. ""We need aircraft in the greater-than-160-seat category and that's in the Airbus neo sweet spot,"" Republic Spokesperson Peter Kowalchuk said.

In its SEC filing the company said it cut ""an amended and restated term sheet"" with Airbus to purchase the 80 aircraft and is subject to the cutting of a definitive document by the end of July.

As part of the deal, Republic also amended its credit agreement with Airbus Financial services originally signed on 30-Oct-2009 and amended Frontier's purchase agreement with Airbus. Its MOU with CFM on the LEAP-X covers, among other things, a fuel burn guarantee, future spare engine pricing, and a reduction in the overhaul cost of existing Airbus engines, it said.

At the same time, it signed a term sheet with GE Capital Aviation Services to amend its A319 leases agreeing on the return of four A319s to GECAS in 2012. The remaining 18 A319 leases, however, are being extended an additional three years albeit at a reduced monthly rate. The company said it operates 58 Airbus aircraft and its website indicates it has 41 A319s, four A318s and nine A320s and it could be the neos are replacements for its current crop of aircraft.

It already has two fleet types given its operation of 15 Embraer E190s. The E170s once used at Frontier have migrated back to the company's capacity-purchase operations under a Delta contract. Should the E190s leave the fleet their remarketing will compete with the 25 E190s JetBlue announced it is re-marketing.

The order is also interesting since Republic is in the process of restructuring Frontier as the result of an unanticipated USD250 million addition to its fuel costs this year. It just cut a deal in which pilots agreed to concessions in return for an equity stake in the troubled carrier in addition to the Indianapolis-based company reducing its stake in the company by the end of 2014. As part of the deal Republic must raise USD70 million, find new investors and find USD120 million in annual cost savings. In its announcement about the pilot deal, it said it was half way to its annual savings goal this year.

Republic has always played its plans close to its vest leaving many questions and confused signals in its wake, especially regarding fleet plans which seem to be all over the map.

If the key to low-cost carriers is a single aircraft fleet, how does that tally with operating two aircraft of the same size - Airbus A319 and CSeries, 138-seat CS300 powered by different engines, the CFM LEAP-X and the Pratt & Whitney PurePower PW1000engine, respectively? It certainly begs the question as to whether Bombardier may offer a second engine option but considering its weak order book, that is highly doubtful, at least at this point.

Republic Airways Holdings Chair Bryan Bedford said the Airbus neo order was symbolic. ""This aircraft order displays our confidence in the bright future ahead for Frontier Airlines,"" he said, before going into a riff about the 15% savings in fuel consumption offered by the neo. ""That fuel savings would correspond to a 5% margin improvement at today's prices.""

The way Frontier has been going recently and its need to recapitalize, it is hard to believe they can now be committing to buy any new future aircraft much less two different types. Bold moves are often used to position companies for sale although why that would be so in this case is anyone's guess except that it projects a stronger future as suggested by Mr Bedford's statement.

Having just emerged from bankruptcy last year, the company has been citing the transition and merger with Midwest Airlines for its rising costs which have been exacerbated by the run up in fuel this year. It is also facing stiff Southwest competition at both its hubs at Denver and Milwaukee. One hopes that it has a better story to tell than what appears on the surface resulting from its announcements in the last few weeks.

The only thing clear is Republic's next earnings call will be very, very interesting."

designed in response to user surveys about the future of air travel, the ‘airbus 2050‘ concept craft houses replaces first, business, and economy classes with lifestyle ‘zones’, all housed in a panoramic transparent body designed for both more comfortable travel and improved environmental efficiency.

in the concept cabin, hand luggage is taken at the entrance to the craft as passengers scan in via a biometric hand sensor, and is moved automatically to one’s seat. the chairs themselves morph to comfortably fit passengers’ bodies, and collect body heat for use in powering the cabin facilities.

video overview of the concept aircraft

airbus predicts the increased presence of bars and other social spaces on airplanes, providing a space for passengers who wish to socialize with others. in the ‘airbus 2050’, personalized ‘zones’ replace the traditional cabin classes.

the ‘smart tech’ zone offers integrated technology and private ‘pop-up pods’ with immersive screens that permit virtual meetings and lectures, or can connect travelers to friends and family.

foreseeing a growing demand for health and relaxation services, owing to the growth in the female and elderly populations, the seats in the ‘vitalizing zone’ adapt to the passenger’s body shape, as well as provide massages and relaxing ‘sound showers’ and aromatherapy as desired.

the ‘interaction zone’ provides a place for passengers to engage in virtual activities. a virtual shopping wall, perhaps used in conjunction with a sky mall -like service, projects clothing directly onto shoppers, while a virtual gaming wall integrates gestural sports gaming. ‘airbus fusion ball’ lets passengers play catch across travel destinations like new york skyscrapers and the himalayas.

the airplane itself benefits from the use of lightweight ‘smart’ materials and composites, as well as longer and slimmer wings that improve air flow and fuel efficiency. engines will be embedded into the rear of the craft, optimizing fuel use and reducing noise levels within. the electrical system is self-monitoring, capable of scheduling any required maintenance.

regarding the transparent body, airbus head of engineering charles champion states: ‘the idea is to have a technology for the fuselage that’s a bit like bones of birds that allows to have large spaces that can turn transparent, in order to look outside and ‘live’ the panorama in which you are flying.‘

the plane’s empennage (tail section) is U-shaped to reduce external noise pollution, since the more reliable engines prevent the need to have a vertical tail for directional stability.

the cost of the innovative cabin designs would be defrayed by reducing maintenance costs in other areas, relying on developments in self-monitoring, ‘intelligent’ technology and advances in innovative materials such as dirt repellent coatings and self-healing covers.

Airbus and Israel Aerospace Industries' first joint defence enterprise will seek to develop a cheaper and simpler airborne surveillance and interception system, after a prototype has been displayed at the Paris Air Show.

AP - Airbus’s military division and state-run Israel Aerospace Industries said Tuesday they are to jointly develop a new airborne early warning and control aircraft.

Airbus spokeswoman Barbara Kracht said it will be the first time Airbus has worked with an Israeli company on any defense project.

Airbus Military CEO Domingo Urena and IAI Vice-President Nissim Hadas said in a statement they had signed a memorandum of understanding at the Paris Air Show, where a C295 early warning aircraft demonstration model has been displayed. Aerial early warning planes, or AWACS, watch and control airspace, warning of approaching enemy planes and sending vectoring planes to intercept.

The C295 is part of Airbus’ popular family of light and medium airlifters, which also includes the smaller C212 and CN235 passenger and cargo aircraft. Earlier this month, Airbus unveiled a demonstration model of the twin turboprop design with a rotating radar dome mounted above the rear fuselage.

Initial flight trials have shown that the aircraft is aerodynamically an excellent platform despite the radar dome, Airbus said.

The United States, NATO nations, Russia, China and India all operate large early warning aircraft based on four-engine passenger jets or cargo aircraft. But Airbus and IAI said they see a growing demand for much smaller, simpler and cheaper planes with the capability to loiter for extended periods of time while providing airborne surveillance over long ranges.

“This cooperation ... will provide the market with a highly efficient and affordable solution, the first in this market segment,” Urena said.

“Emerging conflicts across the globe are emphasizing the importance of special mission fleets. We are sure that by joining forces, we will offer the market the right solution with the right technology,” said Hadas of IAI.

IAI and subsidiary ELTA are leaders in the development of airborne radar systems. Their radars already equip early warning aircraft operated by Israel, India, China and Singapore.

The Airbus Concept Cabin focuses on high levels of customization tailored to suit individual needs including auto-morphing seats and personalized entertainment. Passengers' body heat would also be harvested via the use of smart materials that integrate the electrical system and do away with the need for conventional wires.

The Concept Cabin is an extension of the company's future plane design first canvassed last year. The transparent plane design would be lightweight, bird-bone-like structure, covered by bionic skin membranes.

The Airbus Concept Cabin

Once on-board, a passenger would simply touch the wall to be identified by the plane's ""neural network"" which would then track the person and enable the auto-morphing seats, personalized digital access and automatic responses to personal needs.

Instead of traditional cabin classes, Airbus sees the aircraft interior as being divided into a number of zones. The ""Vitalizing Zone"" would cater for relaxation and well-being with massage and acupressure-enabled seats, antioxidant enriched air, mood lighting and a panoramic view of the sky. There would also be a ""Smart Tech Zone"" and an ""Interactive Zone"" which would imitate any possible social scene, meaning passengers could arrange a virtual business meeting, play a game of virtual golf, go virtual shopping, or read a bedtime story for their kids back at home.

The cabin would also be 100 percent recyclable and feature self-cleaning materials made from plant fibers.

""Our research shows that passengers of 2050 will expect a seamless travel experience while also caring for the environment,"" says Charles Champion, Airbus Executive Vice President Engineering.

We'll be cruising through a selection of photos of the see-through planes that could be taking to the skies in 2050, so please fasten your seatbelt and make sure all electronic devices are turned on.

Airbus has developed designs of the planes that could be jetting us all over the place in 40 years' time. The organic outer wall changes colour, reacting to the light from outside, and even turning transparent.

Airbus says the bionic structure of the jet mimics the efficiency of bird bone, and the plane's membrane-like skin controls air temperature. Seats tilt and adjust to keep you facing towards the light, and heat from your body is harvested to power the lights and in-flight entertainment systems. They also morph into different shapes to fit to your body shape or to your position if you fancy catching 40 winks.

Instead of economy, business and first-class sections, the plane is divided into zones depending on what you fancy doing. There's a relaxation zone in the front and a work zone in the back, with a gaming zone in between. Busy business types can even work on their swing with a virtual golfing environment.

The vitalising zone pumps you full of anti-oxidant and vitamin-enriched air as you enjoy aromatherapy and acupuncture. We wouldn't fancy someone sticking needles in us when there's a chance of turbulence -- we have enough trouble getting our wine in the little plastic thimble they give you, let alone sticking a needle in somebody's pressure points.

We like the idea of different zones, but as busy business class types we wonder how we'd show our superiority to the plebs. Special badges, perhaps. Maybe a little light-up hat.



The futuristic jet plane concept will be on display at the Paris Air Show next week. For planes that are actually flying but are still pretty mind-blowing, take our video tour of the gargantuan Airbus A380.

It all sounds like pie in the sky to us, but click through the photos to see the Airbus concept in flight. What do you think of the jet planes of the future? Plane crazy -- or will they take off? Check in in the comments and proceed to boarding on our Facebook page. Thank you for flying CNET UK.

The Airbus A380 is the largest commercial airplane in the world. It is 237 feet long, 79 feet high and weighs 1.3 million pounds.

The inaugural flight into the Miami airport was full with 526 passengers. The aircraft has two decks and in-seat videos for all passengers.

Passengers coming off the first flight said it was quite an experience.

“I think it was close to nine hours, but for me it was like seconds. I’d like to stay in the air,” said passenger Emilio Lezcano.

The Miami airport is the fifth airport in the nation to have Airbus A380 capabilities.

“This is just a major milestone. It’s historic, and not just for the airport, it goes to the destination. It’s about Miami,” said Jose Abreu, the airport’s director.

Lufthansa also said the plane is the world’s most efficient aircraft, burning almost 12 percent less fuel than any other aircraft.

The plane will fly between Miami and Frankfurt daily.

“This should really help bring a lot more German visitors to Miami, a lot more from Europe and grow our top economic engine,” said Barry Johnson, CEO Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce.

Juergen Sieberock, Lufthansa's top executive for the U.S., said the aircraft will help fly more tourists to the area.

“This is huge event for us. Miami is one of the biggest destinations for Lufthansa,” he said."
Airbus 'overwhelmed' by sales success as A320neo proves a hit at Paris air show - The Guardian,"Wed, 22 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDExL2p1bi8yMi9haXJidXMtbm90Y2hlcy11cC1odWdlLXNhbGVzLWF0LXBhcmlzLWFpci1zaG930gFfaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMTEvanVuLzIyL2FpcmJ1cy1ub3RjaGVzLXVwLWh1Z2Utc2FsZXMtYXQtcGFyaXMtYWlyLXNob3c?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has staked a claim to be the world's number one aircraft maker after it notched up a series of deals at the Paris air show that will take its total for the week to $57bn (£35.4bn).

With Boeing struggling in its wake with a mere $22bn worth of sales for the week, the pan-European manufacturer described the bounty as ""overwhelming"".

On Wedneday it received an order worth $16bn for 180 planes from India's low-cost carrier IndiGo. According to reports the IndiGo order will be followed by another huge deal with Malaysia-based AirAsia for 200 of the same aircraft, thought to be worth $17bn.

Airbus and Boeing dominate the global civil aircraft market with two brands: the short haul A320 that is familiar to easyJet passengers; and the Boeing 737 that transports millions of Ryanair customers around Europe.

However, Airbus has stolen a march on its rival by deciding to build the A320neo, a model that retains the fuselage design but installs new fuel-efficient engines with reinforced wings. With a promise of a 15% improvement in fuel efficiency amid soaring oil prices, the revamp has proved a hit with buyers with more than 700 sold this year alone.

It is also good news for British manufacturing. Airbus employs 17,000 people in Britain at 25 different sites and the aero-space sector accounts for 100,000 jobs. ""We are having a very strong show and we are very pleased with the response to the neo programme: it's overwhelming,"" said John Leahy, the Airbus sales chief

The IndiGo deal for 180 aircraft comprises 150 neo jets and 30 of the classic variety, as Asian and Middle Eastern carriers confirm their emergence as major powers in an aviation market that has been dominated for decades by Europe and the US.

""The big orders are coming from the non-mature countries with the airlines going where the cash is – it's all part of the continuing shift in economic power from west to east,"" said Howard Wheeldon, senior strategist at brokerage BGC Partners. Latin and South America have also become forces to be reckoned with as Chilean carrier LAN Airlines announced an order of 20 A320 neo jets.

Airbus also received another boost for the A320neo via US-based Republic Airways, which signed a letter of intent to buy 80 of the jets worth around $7bn.

Boeing announced a provisional $3.3bn deal with Russia's UTAir for 4o next generation 737 planes, but the market is now eagerly awaiting its riposte to the success of the A320neo.

A Boeing executive said that the company was leaning towards building a new 737 rather than taking the Airbus approach of inserting new engines into old airframes. Randy Tinseth, head of marketing at Boeing, admitted that a re-engine programme was less risky than embarking on an expensive new generation 737. ""We have talked with our customers and … they will tell us what [they would like from] a new aeroplane."" He added: ""This is such a huge investment that we just have to take time to make sure we do the right thing."""

Luckily an A380 owned by Korean Air came to the rescue and flew one of their A380s t0 the Paris Air Show. Being the largest airliner has its benefits and challenges — this is not the first time the A380s size has been an issue.

Paris Air Show Order Wrap-up: Airbus Outsells Boeing for Second Straight Year - NYCAviation - NYCAviation,"Tue, 28 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55Y2F2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDExLzA2L3BhcmlzLWFpci1zaG93LW9yZGVyLXdyYXAtdXAtYWlyYnVzLW91dHNlbGxzLWJvZWluZy8xNjI3MNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The 2011 Paris Air Show was the best ever for Airbus, earning firm orders for 418 aircraft worth about $44 billion at list prices, compared to only 47 planes valued at $7.5 billion for Boeing.

Airbus also outsold Boeing at last year’s Farnborough show, though by a much smaller margin: 130 planes/$13 billion vs. 103 planes/$10 billion.

The big hit were Airbus’s newly introduced A320neo (New Engine Option) jets, which gained 600 orders in Pari sfor a total of 1,029 orders received. The largest order for Airbus came from AirAsia, who waited until the final media day to announce their firm order for 200 of the new A320neo, with a list value estimated at $18.2 billion.

“If our friends over in Seattle still think that the A320NEO is only catching up to their 737NG, what are they smoking?” asked John Leahy, chief operating officer at Airbus, commenting on the vast influx of A320NEO orders during the show.

Airbus had previously announced that they would be stepping up production rates on the A320 line to 42 per month due to the increase in orders for the aircraft. Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus said, “At this time we will continue to study even more and see if the line and suppliers would be able to keep up if we were to increase the rates even more. But at this time we are going to stick with what we had previously announced.”

Avianca: 33 A320neo + 18 A320

Alafco: 30 A320neo

Garuda: 15 A320 + 10 A320neo

Airbus seemed rather surprised with the success that the neo had at its first air show. But Enders went on to say, “This does not change our schedule at all. We have a very strict research and testing schedule that we will stick to. Honestly, no new technological advances will be ready for the narrow body till 2025 at the earliest, so the neo represented the best option at the time for our A320 line family.”

Wait times for new Airbus planes have been pushed back as a result of the increased backlog. Order a new A320 classic today and you’ll have to wait until 2014 for it to show up, or until 2018 for an A320neo, 2013 for an A330, 2018/19 for an A350 and 2015 for an A380.

Some wonder if the A320neo will spell the end for the A320 Classic. Enders would not confirm this other then saying, “We have no plans to stop offering the classic and we are not allowing any airlines to convert past confirmed orders to the neo. However we could have the A320 line producing neo only as early as 2018.”

During the press conference it was revealed that AirAsia has apparently been pushing Airbus to work on creating an A330neo, but Leahy and Enders both quickly shot that down for now stating that Airbus has more than enough on its plate for the current time.

Boeing, on the other hand, took in only 132 orders. Pressure for Boeing to design an updated 737 increased dramatically as several 737 customers made big orders for the Airbus A320neo.

What does it look like? According to Airbus’ lofty prediction, which will likely cause more than a few retrospective chuckles down the road, passengers flying in 2050 should be able to play a game of virtual golf, breathe in antioxidant-enriched air and watch the sky take shape through the cabin’s translucent airframe, all while in flight.

A year after Airbus outlined its idea of a futuristic airliner – an airplane with greater speed and eco-friendly technology – the company is giving prospective passengers a view from the inside. And that view is a grand one.

Dubbed the Airbus Concept Cabin, the design includes a spacious interior encased in a smart cabin wall membrane that can become transparent, allowing passengers to take in panoramic sky views in-flight. The airplane’s lightweight bionic structure, made to mirror the efficiencies of bird flight, would provide strength and allow for air temperature control where needed.

In place of traditional class seating, the cabin offers separate zones uniquely tailored to meet the different needs of all passengers, be they business travelers, socialites, techies or relaxation seekers. Need a place to game or hold a business meeting? No problem. Looking to enjoy some mood lighting or aromatherapy? The Concept Cabin has you covered.

In spite of its extensive amenities, the futuristic airplane would boast a 100 percent recyclable cabin that utilizes passenger body heat to power a variety of its features.

Airbus admits that, in reality, many of the technologies the company is working to develop “may not be seen in the exact manner as in the Airbus Concept Plane and Cabin.” Nonetheless, the company’s idea is likely to spark a whimsical chord, or a good laugh, among many of today’s frequent airline passengers.

For now, I think we’d all be happy to settle for a few extra inches of legroom.

How America just lost 1 million green(ish) jobs to Europe - Grist,"Thu, 30 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vZ3Jpc3Qub3JnL2J1c2luZXNzLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kvMjAxMS0wNi0yOS1ob3ctYW1lcmljYS1qdXN0LWxvc3Qtb25lLW1pbGxpb24tZ3JlZW5pc2gtam9icy10by1ldXJvcGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Most underplayed economic story of the week: European aircraft manufacturer Airbus “trounced” the traditional U.S. behemoth Boeing at the Paris Air Show, booking a record $50 billion more in orders for new planes. The reason: commercial plane buyers’ demands for high fuel efficiency and low emissions. Here’s the Associated Press report on how Airbus racked up a whopping 730 new plane orders compared to a measly 142 for Boeing:

Airbus has cashed in on airlines’ desire to reduce sky-high fuel costs and cut their carbon dioxide emissions. Airbus says the A320neo is 15 percent more fuel efficient than rival aircraft like Boeing’s 737 … Airbus’ success cast a long shadow over Chicago-based Boeing, which recorded only $22 billion in orders and commitments, and raised questions over the U.S. planemaker’s ability to compete in a market dominated by concerns over high fuel prices.

That giant sucking sound you hear is approximately 1 million well-paying American jobs leaving Boeing factories in Seattle and other parts of America and heading to Airbus facilities in Toulouse, Seville, and Hamburg (job numbers include both direct, indirect, and induced and are estimates based on numbers from University of Massachusetts, the Center for American Progress, Boeing, and other sources).

This is Europe’s green dividend: the cash and jobs the continent is reaping from its strong climate law and a culture that’s committed to planet-friendly innovation. It’s a lonely economic bright spot in an economy still dealing with the aftershocks of recession, real estate bubbles, and overly cautious fiscal policy.

The extent to which green innovation has permeated European business was on display in an exclusive Grist interview with Airbus’ Martin Fendt after the Paris Air Show. When I asked why his company had decided to invest so much time, money, and energy in focusing on fuel efficiency and low carbon, he didn’t know how to respond at first, because low carbon and fuel efficiency are so integrated into Airbus’ culture. But he went on:

It’s quite self-explanatory — at Airbus, we want to reduce CO2 emissions, increase performance of the aircraft, and help reduce the amount airlines need to spend on fuel. In every one of those “boxes,” there’s a benefit to having less fuel consumption: We get 15 percent better fuel efficiency, that means you can fly 15 percent further, emit 15 percent less CO2 per passenger mile, and you don’t have to carry as much fuel for a given mission. It’s a win-win-win-win.

Of course, there are other factors at play here too. As Rick Perlstein wrote in his seminal essay “The Stockticker and the Superjumbo,” Boeing is still paying for abandoning its once-successful strategy of long-term investments in innovative, groundbreaking products like the 747 jumbo jet in service of short-term profits meant to goose its quarterly earnings. Meanwhile, Airbus has maintained a decades-long commitment to the kind of painstaking, long-term R&D that helped it deliver the star of the Paris Air Show, the hyperefficient A320neo.

These days, of course, there’s not much difference between investing for the future and investing in green.

Unfortunately, based on the reaction from both sides of the political spectrum, I’m not sanguine about America’s ability to learn from this latest economic setback.

The far right’s perhaps predictable response didn’t look at the situation as it was, but merely invoked Tea Party economic mythology to blame Boeing’s setback not on a lack of government efficiency incentives, obsession with quarterly profits, or management lapses, but … labor unions.

According to this version of the story, Boeing’s failure is attributable to an eight-week strike in 2008 that delayed deliveries of some of its 787s (yes, that’s three years ago), and because the National Labor Relations Board is asking questions about Boeing’s decision to move some operations away from its unionized workforce to right-to-work South Carolina, a move seen as illegal retaliation for the strike by union members. In this worldview, there’s just no way could it have been Boeing’s series of heroic scandal–plagued, stock-price-chasing CEOs or America’s lagging green business culture. Like most Tea Party conceits, this one defies the experience of pretty much every other reality-based observer.

It also doesn’t make sense on another level: Bluntly, our country has nothing on Europe when it comes to strikes. Airbus has experienced at least as many labor actions as Boeing, but it doesn’t seem to have stopped the company from delivering the fuel-efficient planes airlines want to buy.

I wish I could report that the president was providing a counterweight to this anti-innovation attitude, in the same way he has signaled that he’s going to force American auto companies to achieve moderately ambitious increases in fuel efficiency. But just as Airbus was drubbing Boeing at the Paris Air Show, the Obama administration took the opportunity to announce that it would insist that Europe-bound flights on U.S. carriers be exempted from European laws requiring them to cut their emissions. If you can’t beat ’em, unleash the lobbyists.

Meanwhile, a new study shows that the most efficient airlines burn less than half the amount of fuel as the worst — showing that the big emitters can easily meet European requirements and probably save money by cutting fuel costs.

The bottom line is this: America will lose more and more jobs as long as American government responds to urgent economic and environmental wake-up calls as further excuses to coddle and comfort polluting industries as they fall further behind their global competitors. Unless we get government and business move quickly to green innovation, that sucking sound is just going to get louder.

Hitching a Ride With Lufthansa on Their Frankfurt to Miami Inaugural Airbus A380 Flight - Airline Reporter,"Wed, 15 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJsaW5lcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tLzIwMTEvMDYvaGl0Y2hpbmctYS1yaWRlLXdpdGgtbHVmdGhhbnNhLW9uLXRoZWlyLWZyYW5rZnVydC10by1taWFtaS1pbmF1Z3VyYWwtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtZmxpZ2h0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Last Friday marked the first time that an Airbus A380 has landed at Miami International Airport (MIA). This was the first Lufthansa Airlines flight from Frankfurt (FRA) to Miami operated by the double-decker Airbus A380.

Miami becomes the third US destination that Lufthansa flies the A380 and the sixth destination internationally. Although the airline has gained experience flying the seven Airbus A380s in their fleet, this was the first time any A380 has landed at Miami.

“We are extremely excited to introduce our new, flagship A380 aircraft as the very first in the Miami market,” said Jens Bischof, Member of the Lufthansa German Airlines Board, Sales and Revenue Management. “I applaud Miami International Airport’s management team for their determination to become A380-ready. We share in their excitement and are both committed to Miami’s community of global travelers in both the business and leisure markets.”

I had the opportunity to fly on the upper-deck of the large aircraft, which houses eight first class and 98 business class (where I was sitting) seats. The lower deck contains only economy seats — 420 to be exact. When arriving at the airport I already had my boarding pass and no baggage to check and having a business class ticket allowed me to take the VIP line at security — which did not matter too much since traffic was a bit slow.

When stepping up to security I realized I didn’t know Germany’s rules. Did I have to take out my laptop? Toothpaste? How about body scanners? Things were much different than here in the US –talk about service.

There was a security agent where you unload your stuff and they didn’t assume I knew what to do. They smiled as they let me know I needed to take out my laptop and all metal from my body. I didn’t have to take off my shoes or remove my toothpaste. After going through the metal detector, there was another friendly agent to help me get my stuff and I actually had room and time to gather my things. A far cry from going through security in Seattle.

At the gate, there is a business class lounge located upstairs where one can relax, get a drink and a bite to eat. Before boarding there were folks from the airline that gave a speech with the three pilots and head flight attendant looking on. We were able to board from the lounge and take an upper jetway directly onto the top deck.

Having the entire upper-deck as business class has its pluses and minuses. Even though there are quite a few actual and “fake” bulk-heads (fabric giving the feeling to sections) in the aircraft, there are still 98 of the same seats up top. This does take away a bit of the exclusive feel that flying in a premium seat normally has. However, if you are able to swing a first class ticket, there are only eight of those seats and definitely feels exclusive.

The business class product on the A380 is very similar to the product found on other aircraft with a few changes. There is a new universal outlet and an updated entertainment system with more content, which is good since I watched a good number of movies flying over on my Seattle to Frankfurt flight just 24 hours prior. Even with the updates, I was kind of hoping for a few more movie choices.

The best change is the ability to view one of three cameras located on the A380: on the tail, on the nose looking down and another looking straight. Of course, nothing beats seeing what is in front of the aircraft directly from the cockpit.

A few of us were invited to take a tour of the flight deck while we were over the Atlantic Ocean. I have been in cockpits during flights before, but never allowed to take photos — bonus. The five of us were easily able to fit in the flight deck and what an amazing view — inside and out. For some reason, seeing the vast blue sky and clouds looked so much better from the cockpit windscreen versus a side window.

The process of getting to the flight deck was a bit of an eye opener. I was sitting near the front of the upper deck, but we had to go to the back of the plane to use the rear stairs and then walk the length of the aircraft on the bottom deck. I have been on an empty A380 and it just doesn’t feel the same when every economy seat is taken. It felt like we had to walk a mile and through hundreds of people (420 to be exact) before getting to the cockpit. That was a heck of a lot of people and I was happy to return to the upper deck when the tour was complete.

I have been hearing how quiet the plane is during take off, but I kind of brushed it off as PR-talk. Since this was my first time taking a flight in one, I paid extra attention when we took off. I was genuinely shocked at how quiet the plane was at full throttle taking off from Frankfurt with a full load. It took us a good chunk of the runway to finally rotate, but it didn’t even sound like the engines were at full throttle — impressive.

The trip to Germany and the flight back were great experiences, but the landing easily trumped them of both. We touched down in Miami to hundreds of people lined up along the airport and freeway to greet the plane. I had never seen so many people line up to greet a plane like that before. This wasn’t just one group of people, but hundreds lining the length of the runway to catch a glimpse of our Airbus A380 landing — it was surreal.

I feel that Miami has a unique love affair with aviation. Eastern Air Lines used to be based in Miami and so many people are still very proud of the airline and the influence it had on aviation. Miami International Airport is proud to be one of very few airports to host the Airbus A380.

’œToday is one of the proudest days in the history of MIA and Miami-Dade County,’ said Miami-Dade Aviation Director Jose Abreu. ’œLufthansa’s A380 service elevates MIA into an elite class of airports worldwide that are capable of receiving this groundbreaking aircraft. We congratulate Lufthansa and deeply appreciate them for helping us reach another historic milestone.’

The A380 is one large plane that is able to carry one heck of a lot of people. It provides better economics per passenger compared to other aircraft (when nearly full) and is amazing to see in person with its double decks. I still do not think the A380 is as majestic as the Boeing 747, but it does its job and does it well. It has a beauty all of its own that truly is hard to compare to other aircraft. This might have been my first A380 flight, but I doubt my last.

The Forest Hills, NY-based airline has purchased 40 more fuel efficient Airbus A320neo aircraft, and converted 30 of its 52 outstanding classic A320 orders to larger A321 aircraft.

In addition, all new A320s delivered to JetBlue after 2013 will come fitted with winglets to improve fuel burn and range, and the existing A320 fleet will be retrofitted with winglets.

Also, eight A320 orders previously scheduled for delivery in 2014 and 2015 have been pushed back to 2017 in an effort to “smooth out aircraft deliveries, reducing capital commitment over the near term.”

Finally, JetBlue’s Embraer E190 fleet, originally set to top out at 100 planes, will be “optimized” to 75 instead. “The E190 is performing very well as our new, shorter-haul market aircraft, often serving to build the demand in the market for eventual up-gauge to our A320,” said JetBlue President and CEO Dave Barger in a statement. “We are now at the point where the balance between frequency and capacity is tipping in favor of capacity, and we are exercising our most strategic asset – our order book – to better match capacity with growing network demand.”

The A320neo (New Engine Option) is an update of Airbus’s wildly popular narrowbody aircraft line designed to increase fuel efficiency, range and/or capacity. While sharing 95 percent of the classic A320’s parts, the neo will use new engines and larger, sharklet-style wingtips to burn about 15 percent less fuel, which translates to about 500nm of extra range or two tons of added payload. Two engines are available— CFM International’s LEAP-X and Pratt & Whitney’s PurePower PW1100G—but JetBlue has not yet decided on one.

JetBlue’s A321s will be powered by IAE engines, as are their classic A320s. First deliveries will occur in 2013.

“Our network strategy, with its focus on New York, Boston, and the Caribbean/Latin America, is exceeding our expectations, and this revised fleet plan will help us continue to execute our strategy,” said Mr. Barger. “Our goal is to continue to grow on a sustainable basis, generate positive free cash flow and continue to enhance our customers’ experience.”

“With today’s announcement, we have taken significant steps in reducing our annual capital commitments through the next five years, while ensuring we are positioned for long-term success in a competitive, fuel challenged, environment,” said JetBlue Chief Financial Officer Ed Barnes.

Over 400 A320neo family jets have been ordered since the line’s launch in December 2010. JetBlue-rival Virgin America is set to become the launch customer of the A320neo thanks to an order in January of this year, with first deliveries expected in 2016."
Airbus reveals its vision of flying in 2050 - The Guardian,"Tue, 14 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDExL2p1bi8xNC9haXJidXMtZnV0dXJlLW9mLWZseWluZ9IBSGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDExL2p1bi8xNC9haXJidXMtZnV0dXJlLW9mLWZseWluZw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A futuristic concept of air travel in which passengers will be able to gaze up at sunny or starry skies through a transparent cabin has been presented by planemaker Airbus .

The concept cabin for travellers in 2050 would be a bionic structure that mimics the efficiency of bird bone.

It would provide strength where needed, and also allows for an ""intelligent"" cabin wall membrane which controls air temperature and can become transparent to give passengers open, panoramic views.

The cabin would have seats that fit passengers' body shapes and travellers might be able to read bedtime stories to their children back home, Airbus said.

Showing off its concept cabin, the company also said that mid-century passengers might be able to enjoy a game of virtual golf or take part in interactive conferences, while the cabin ""identifies and responds"" to travellers' needs.

The cabin of the future follows last year's unveiling of the Airbus concept plane, packed with technologies to reduce fuel burn, emissions, waste and noise.

In the cabin concept, new personalised zones replace the traditional cabin classes.

The ""vitalising zone"" helps passengers relax, with vitamin and antioxidant-enriched air, mood lighting, aromatherapy and acupressure treatments.

In the ""interactive zone"" there are virtual pop-up projections taking passengers to whichever social scene they want to be in, from holographic gaming to virtual changing rooms for active shoppers.

The ""smart tech zone"" is tailored towards the more functional-oriented passenger with what Airbus describes as ""a chameleon-style offering, to meet individual needs ranging from a simple to a complete luxury service, but all allowing you to continue life as if on the ground"".

Airbus engineering executive vice-president Charles Champion said: ""Our research shows that passengers of 2050 will expect a seamless travel experience while also caring for the environment.

""The concept cabin is designed with that in mind, and shows that the journey can be as much a voyage of discovery as the destination."""
Photo Tour of an Airbus A380 at Lufthansa Technik in Frankfurt - Airline Reporter,"Wed, 29 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMS8wNi9waG90by10b3VyLW9mLWx1ZnRoYW5zYS10ZWNobmlrLWluLWZyYW5rZnVydC1nZXJtYW55L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"How do you make the Airbus A380, the world’s largest airliner, look small? Put it into the Lufthansa Technik Hangar in Frankfurt Germany that’s how. While in Frankfurt for a 24 hour spiel to celebrate Lufthansa’s first Airbus A380 flight from Frankfurt to Miami, I had a chance to go check out where maintenance is done on the A380.

At the time, I have seen the A380 at a distance and even got to tour the inside. But this was my first opportunity to walk around the aircraft on the outside. It is surreal how tall it is standing next to it, but how at the same time it is so close to the ground. I am 6’1″ tall and my head was touching the bottom of the aircraft when taking the photo above. Closer towards the main landing gear, there is even less head room. From ground to tail, the A380 is about eight stories tall and just the fuselage is about three.

Lufthansa Technik Group is compiled of 30 companies world-wide that help keep Lufthansa and many other aircraft operational. Lufthansa Technik has the ability to perform checks at 60 airports around the world and they are organized into six different operational groups which serve about 750 customers worldwide: Maintenance, Overhaul, Component Services, Engine Services, VIP Services and Landing Gear Services.

Three “out holes” for the A380. The larger ones vent out air, the center will vent liquid.

Before Lufthansa took delivery of their first Airbus A380, two large facilities were built for Lufthansa Technik to handle the new aircraft. One was in Frankfurt and the other is located in Beijing. The facility in Frankfurt was completed in December of 2007 and measures about 590 x 460 feet. The hangar is large enough to hold two Airbus A380s and one Dreamlifter as was proven not too long ago.

Obviously the Airbus A380 can hold a lot of fuel — about 85,000 gallons worth. Unlike most other aircraft, no fuel is stored in the fuselage and it is all stored in the wings. During the tour I was wondering how I had dripping water on my head and realized that I was being rained on via the condensation from the fuel tanks in the wings.

Buying the aircraft and building the hangar is just part of the process. Lufthansa Technik also had to get the tools, parts and people to make it complete. The facility has more than 70,000 parts in their inventory ranging from screws to engines. Outside the hangar there is a jet testing area, which was in use during our visit (but could not take photos since it was a non-Lufthansa aircraft).

During the tour of the facility we were able to get on board D-AIMG to take a look around. Since I was about to take a 10 hour flight in an A380 in a few hours, I decided to hang out more in the front of the aircraft by the cockpit. Lufthansa’s A380 are designed so there is an external door that leads to a crew sleeping area and lavatory for the flight crew. The crew rest area was actually the largest I have seen in an aircraft and didn’t feel as claustrophobic as others.

Some folks think first class is the best seat in the house. Although they are nice, they cannot compare to the seats in the cockpit. The cockpit is very roomy and it is hard to get a feeling of the true size of the aircraft. The flight deck is located in the middle of the aircraft, which doesn’t give it the sense of height that the cockpit in the Boeing 747-400 has.

Airbus Military Tests AEW&C Configured C295 - Defense Update,"Wed, 08 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTEwNjA4X2MyOTVfYWV3Yy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The first Airbus Military C295 development aircraft fitted with an Airbone Early Warning sand Command (AEW&C) rotodome has successfully completed its first flight on 7th June 2011 at Airbus Military’s site in Seville (Spain). The flight follows extensive research and development work, including wind tunnel testing, leading to the conversion of a C295 to be fitted with the in-house developed rotodome.

The six meter diameter rotodome fitted for the initial trials is a fixed dummy structure intended to verify aerodynamic and structural impact of the rotodome on the aircraft’s overall structure, handling qualities and performance. Flight testing will continue during the next three months to complete the feasibility study and fully validate the concept. On production aircraft the rotodome would be a fast-rotating device housing a state-of-the-art radar providing full 360 degree and continuous coverage of a selected area.

The C295 is currently used for other Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance applications such as maritime patrol, anti-submarine warfare or environmental protection missions. The purpose of the current trials is to demonstrate the C295’s capability in the AEW&C domain, thereby expanding the range of C-295 applications beyond the current missions. In recent months the smaller C-235 has been mentioned as a potential aerial gunship, to be modified by ATK for Jordan’s King Abdullah II Design and Development Bureau.

As an AEW&C platform the Airbus Military’s C295 will offer relatively large cabin, compared to business-jet based platforms (Gulfstream G550 or Embraer ERJ-145). The Fully Integrated Tactical System (FITS) avionics architecture offers efficient integration of on-board sensors, including operation and monitoring of the future radar system and display of the aerial picture."

Composite class: developing the Airbus A350-XWB - The Engineer,"Mon, 20 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWVuZ2luZWVyLmNvLnVrL2NvbnRlbnQvaW4tZGVwdGgvY29tcG9zaXRlLWNsYXNzLWRldmVsb3BpbmctdGhlLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXh3Yi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The future is plastics, as the young Dustin Hoffman was memorably told in the 1960s classic film The Graduate. For the aerospace industry, it was certainly some distance into the future. It’s only now, more than 40 years later, that polymers are starting to make serious inroads in the construction of aircraft; but the era of the plastic plane is well and truly with us. Boeing’s 787, the first major airliner to be predominantly made from composites, is expected to be certified later this year. Meanwhile, the Airbus A350 XWB, which also makes heavy use of the lightweight material, is currently in the final stages of preparation before a planned first flight in 2013.

Flight of fancy: the 53 per cent composite A350 XWB has a 64.8m wingspan and a 64m cockpit in its basic variant

The XWB in the designation stands for ’extra-wide body’, and the A350’s cabin will seat nine abreast in standard class and eight in premium class the company claims that each seat will be 1.3cm wider than the equivalent configuration of the aircraft’s chief competitor, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. In fact, the entire concept of the aircraft was originally conceived as a response to the Boeing 787. Initially proposing an updated version of its previous wide-body jet, the A330, the company responded to criticism of a lack of ambition by launching a programme to design a lighter-weight, more aerodynamic airliner that could match the Dreamliner’s claimed 25 per cent reduction in fuel consumption compared with its predecessor.

In fact, the company has ended up designing an aircraft that will compete more with the Boeing 777 than the Dreamliner, as it’s a slightly larger aircraft; the A350 family will seat 270-440 people, to the 787’s 210-330. There are three aircraft in the A350 family, with the basic model actually being the middle one, designated the A350 XWB-900, with a 65m-long fuselage and a maximum take-off weight of 268 tonnes; the smaller -800 is a shortened-fuselage variant, while the larger -1000 is stretched.

Most parts of the aircraft are a mixture of composite and alloy

The A350 also has a slightly higher proportion of composites in its construction than the Dreamliner 53 per cent, as opposed to 50 per cent. The remaining 47 per cent is composed of titanium and aluminium-lithium alloy. Most parts of the aircraft are a mixture of composite and alloy; in the wings, the main metal components are inter-spar ribs (the spars being the supporting structures running along the wing from tip to root, and the ribs running across the width of the structure). In the fuselage, the outer skin panels are carbon fibre, as is the frame, although the frame includes aluminium strips to ensure that lightning strikes can be dissipated. The supporting cross beams are metallic.

As this is the first composite fuselage Airbus has manufactured, testing is under way, with a composite panel replacing an aluminium one on an A340 testbed, providing information on the acoustic performance of the material. ’Composite is neither worse nor better [in terms of acoustics]; it’s just different,’ said Didier Evrard, A350 XWB programme manager. ’We thought we needed to get information on adjusting the acoustic dampeners.’

Airbus has built two fuselage demonstrators at its Hamburg facility, including a full-scale demonstrator that it is using to test installation and systems an approach it adopted after problems with the wiring systems of the A380, which were designed in digital mock-ups. Difficulties with translating this onto the real aircraft led to delays in the delivery of the super-jumbo. ’We are training our pre-final assembly line people and testing the system installation process on the physical mock-up at Hamburg,’ said Evrard. ’The teams train on installing the harnesses, pipes, tubes and wires before we move to the aircraft for real. It has been really useful, with the technicians and designers informing each other on changes and improvements.’

The wing of the A350 XWB is an integral part of the overall design for fuel economy, and may be the most distinctive part of the aircraft, with its thin cross section and upwards-curving tips. It is the second composite wing that Airbus has tackled, but the first for a commercial airliner; the first was for the A400M military transport aircraft.

The way the wings will be constructed does, however, represent a first for the company: they will be built in a horizontal configuration, instead of vertically, like previous wings. This is to allow access to the central wing box area and to make the holes for the components installed underneath the wings easier to get to.

Thinking straight: in a first for Airbus, the A350 wings will be assembled horizontally rather than vertically

The wings will be assembled at Airbus’s facility in Broughton, near Manchester, using parts from all over the world: front spar from Spirit Aerosystems in the US; rear spar from GKN in Filton, near Bristol; leading edge also from Spirit, but this time from Prestwick in Scotland; upper cover from Germany; and lower cover from Spain.

Once shipped to Broughton, the spars will be attached to the aluminium-lithium ribs, and the covers will be fixed temporarily into place for drilling. The covers are a single piece, rather than multiple parts as on the much larger A380 wing and, again in contrast to the A380, the skins for the wings are bonded rather than bolted into place, so far fewer holes are needed only 5,000 per cover, rather than the quarter of a million for an A380 cover. Once drilled, the covers are removed for deburring and sealing, and then replaced for fastening onto the structure. The internal structures fuel tanks and some of the hydraulics are installed, before the wing is sent for painting and then flown over to another Airbus plant, in Bremen, where the electrics, pneumatics, control surfaces and remaining hydraulics are put into place. When that is done, it’s off to the final assembly in Toulouse.

The shift to composite parts rather than metallic puts a different emphasis on the manufacturing process. Metallic parts are generally produced ’near net’ that is, close to the specifications needed but not spot-on, with machining providing the final touches to get within the engineering tolerances. But composite parts are made the right size from the start, so the most precise engineering has to go into making the tools to produce the parts, rather than into making the parts themselves.

The A350 has a slightly higher proportion of composites in its construction than the Dreamliner aircraft

Electronic systems for the aircraft come from Thales, which is providing both the cockpit and the in-flight entertainment systems. The cockpit will have a similar feel to other Airbus models which is part of the company’s policy to ensure pilots can make the transition to the new aircraft easily and Thales has customised its head-up display (HUD) system, used on the A380, for the A350 family.

Real trend:made by Thales, the cockpit utilises head-up display technology more typically used in fighter jet

The cockpit design, currently being tested in Toulouse, has six displays, with the HUD and the on-board airport navigation system integrated into the display system, which will host the software directly. This has allowed Thales to dispense with a separate processing unit for these systems, which is said to free up cockpit space while reducing weight by about 15kg and cutting electricity consumption by 150W.

HUD is a relative newcomer to commercial airline cockpits, although it has been used by military pilots for years. However, Airbus began using it in 2009, and had it on its wishlist for the A350 series from the start, said Michel Soler of Thales Avionics. ’Thales’s HUD was part of the initial design of the A350 and will get certification when the aircraft enters into service, meaning quicker delivery for customers,’ he said. ’HUD on commercial airliners is now a real trend. Our goal is for this type of product to become standard on all Airbus aircraft in the near term.’

In another similarity to the A380, the A350 will have its own engine, developed by Rolls-Royce. The latest version of the Trent range of turbofan engines, the Trent XWB, underwent its first test last June. ’The Trent XWB has the lowest carbon emissions of any wide-body engine, and will be the most fuel-efficient engine on the market,’ said Ian Crawford, director of Airbus programmes at Rolls-Royce.

“Our goal is for the head-up display to become standard on all Airbus aircraft” Michel Soler, Thales Avionics

The Trent XWB, as its name implies, is a development, rather than a step-change, in engine design. It is a three-shaft turbofan, lighter than previous members of the Trent family owing to the use of bladed discs (blisks) in its compressor stages, rather than turbine discs where the blades are attached to the central section the first stage of the eight-fan intermediate pressure compressor is a blisk, as are the first three of the six fans of the high-pressure compressor. The main fan of the engine is huge 3m across, wider than the entire fuselage of a Concorde, and sized to keep the engine operating quietly when it has to handle heavier loads.

Engine: the main fan for the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB is 3m across, and it also incorporates one-piece bladed discs

Other innovations include improved heat-resistant materials, which enhance efficiency, and larger bearings able to handle greater load.

One issue that remains to be resolved is whether the same engine will serve all models of the A350 XWB fleet. This was the initial plan, but airlines have expressed concern that the engine as currently designed will not deliver enough power for the largest version of the aircraft, the A350-1000. There is speculation that Rolls-Royce will develop a more powerful variant of the Trent XWB for the A350-1000, with news agency Reuters quoting a major A350 customer, the chief executive of Air Lease Corporation, saying the current configuration wasn’t sufficient for payload, range and runway performance on the larger aircraft and that Rolls-Royce had agreed to look again at a new design. An announcement is expected at the Paris Air Show, after this issue of The Engineer has gone to press."

Korean Air will gradually expand its A380 service to short-haul routes in Asia, such as Bangkok in Jul-2011, followed by long-haul routes to destinations in Europe and North America, such as New York in Aug-2011, Paris in Sep-2011 and Los Angeles in Oct-2011. Meanwhile, Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International GM Louis Miller this month stated Korean Air expects to use the A380 on services to Atlanta ""sometime next year"". Korean Air operates B747 equipment on Seoul-Atlanta service at present. A380s are operated on 27 routes to 20 destinations on a worldwide basis.

Growing A380 network especially in Asia-Pacific 49 A380s flying 27 routes to 20 destinations

Korean Air has ordered 10 A380 aircraft with the first five to be delivered by the end of 2011 and the remaining five by 2014. The aircraft was received on 02-Jun-2011 after successfully completing final flight and ground tests in Toulouse. The carrier's first A380 has been financed by an ECA-backed agreement with Crédit Agricole CIB and KfW.

Korean Air operates lowest density A380s



Korean Air is operating the lowest density A380s in the industry, configured in a three-class layout with 407 seats. The A380 cabin features 12 first class, 94 business class and 301 economy class seats. Korean Air has also taken the bold step of being the first carrier globally to devote an entire deck of the A380 to a single class, with the deck to feature only business-class seats. On the other end of the spectrum, Air Austral has floated an 840-seat configuration.

Korean Air becomes first carrier to offer flying duty free shop



In addition, Korean Air has become the first airline to offer a flying duty free shop. The stall has been designed and manufactured for Korean Air by AIM Aviation and will replace 13 seats on the A380. The carrier expects to make up for the lost revenue in duty free sales.

Lancome has purchased the first advertising spot inside the shop, which will promote ""new, existing and exclusive products"" from the airline's duty-free range. It will be complemented by the continuation of the regular cart service, according Heather Cho, from Korean Air's Catering and Inflight Sales Business Division, speaking with Australian Business Traveller.

The Korean flag carrier is hopeful the new A380 offering will turn around a slump in its inflight duty free sales. Korean Air has set a target of USD200 million in inflight duty free sales revenue for 2011 - in line with USD201 million generated in 2010. Deputy General Manager Inflight Sales, JY Jung, told Trend: ""The indiscriminate promotions of airport duty free shops have seriously affected our inflight sales. Monthly revenue has gradually decreased since Jun-2010 and the slump is continuing.""

Korean Air stated its duty free sales rankings by value for May-2011 saw Ballantine's Scotch whisky (Blended whisky), Shui Jing Fang (other liquor), Chanel fragrances (perfume), SK-II (cosmetics), Hawaiian Sun (confectionary) and Swarovski pendant (accessories) lead their respective categories for a second consecutive month.

Asiana Airlines to also add A380s in 2011

Also in South Korea, Asiana Airlines CEO Yoon Young Doo, quoted by Bloomberg on 31-Mar-2011 stated the carrier plans to add six new A380s to its fleet in 2011 for US and European services. It has been previously reported officially by the carrier that it would take delivery of the first A380 in 2014. Asiana has also announced the award of a contract to Rolls-Royce for Trent 900 engines to power six A380 aircraft. The order includes a TotalCare long-term service agreement.

Airbus has taken 10 A380 orders this year, six from Asiana Airlines and four from Japanese LCC Skymark Airlines, with Hong Kong Airlines to be the third new A380 customer this year when it announced either an MoU or LoI at next week's Paris Air Show. Hong Kong Airlines will also become the second operator in the Greater China region to order the A380. China Southern Airlines expects to take delivery of the first of its five A380s in Sep-2011. China Southern Airlines Chairman Si Xian Min recently confirmed that the carrier is expecting another of its five A380s on order in Nov-2011.

Airbus CEO Tom Enders, in May-2011, said the manufacturer still intends to deliver around 25 A830s in 2011, as Rolls-Royce recovers from problems with the Trent 900 and Airbus eliminates the last production issues. After delivering its 10th A380 this year to Korean Airlines, Airbus plans to deliver four more to the carrier before the end of the year. Orders currently stand at 234, with 49 aircraft in operation at present.

The airplane giant unveiled new details of the ""cabin of the future"" from its concept plane on Tuesday, as well as a new website with cool photos and details galore.

“We had talked previously about a concept plane,"" Airbus spokesman Clay McConnell told FoxNews.com. ""But we haven't really talked in detail about some of the cabin possibilities.""

The most eye-opening part: the plane itself will be more or less invisible, featuring not a traditional steel outer shell but a transparent membrane -- more or less see through for passengers -- that changes color based on the time of day.

Afraid of flying? Better find a new jet.

The plane itself will be chock full of other technology as well, which Airbus claims will be customized to each passenger's needs. No longer divided up by first class, business, and economy, it is divided by the individual needs of the passenger such as relaxing, playing games, and interacting with other passengers or people on the ground.

The revitalizing zone offers large panoramic views of the world above and below, and seats that form to your body, can massage, and can provide drinks or vitamins as required.

“Seats would be morphable, so that you could have a work space or a sleeping space or a visiting space, depending on what you wanted,"" McConnell told FoxNews.com.

The “interaction zone” of the plane involves a lot of virtual technology. Passengers will be able to shop in a way like never before, with the clothes projected onto them. This interaction is going to involve interaction between passenger and technology and also passenger to passenger.

More active passengers will have the ability to chose between a virtual gaming wall that lets them experience golf, baseball, and tennis, not to mention a bar scene for those who want to socialize and meet new people, as well as pop-up pods to give passengers privacy and enable them to engage in business meetings, romantic dinners, or even read a book to their children at home.

Despite all these ridiculously neat features, the main focus of the Airbus Concept Plane has been about the consumer’s relationship with the environment. The layout and creation of this plane was inspired by nature and has been designed to protect it.

Innovative ideas like morphing materials, bionic structures, holographic technology, and energy harvesting are all being implemented to make the planes as self sufficient as possible.

The launch of “The Future by Airbus” has outlined the five pillars of the organization, future energy resources, fight paths of the future, future travel solutions, research and technology, and future talent.

This endeavor is ‘aimed at highlighting both the challenges and solutions for air travel in the future,” McConnell said."

Airbus's star jet has been grounded after clipping a wing on a taxiway structure, the latest in an embarrassing string of incidents for the European plane-maker at the aviation industry's premier showcase.

The A380 superjumbo suffered damage to its wing tip yesterday after the low-speed collision with a building at the Le Bourget airport, where the air show is taking place.

The aircraft had been scheduled to make demonstration flights during the show but these have now been cancelled, Eads spokesman Alexander Reinhardt said.

The Airbus A400M military transport plane also had to cancel a demonstration flight because of what the manufacturer described as a minor gearbox problem, although the aircraft will still make a flyover during President Nicolas Sarkozy's visit to the show today, Mr Reinhardt said."

Airbus and Rolls-Royce to enhance A350-1000 capability - Skies Magazine,"Mon, 20 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZXNtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1cy1hbmQtcm9sbHMtcm95Y2UtdG8tZW5oYW5jZS1hMzUwLTEwMDAtY2FwYWJpbGl0eS1odG1sL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZXNtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1cy1hbmQtcm9sbHMtcm95Y2UtdG8tZW5oYW5jZS1hMzUwLTEwMDAtY2FwYWJpbGl0eS1odG1sLz9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus and Rolls-Royce will jointly develop the A350-1000 with more powerful Trent XWB engines. In doing so, Airbus has responded to the market call to offer even more payload and range. The enhanced version of the Trent XWB engine will be fully optimised for the largest member of the A350 XWB Family and will deliver up to 97,000lbs of thrust on takeoff, making it the most powerful engine ever developed for an Airbus aircraft. The entry into service is set for mid 2017.

Fabrice Bregier, Airbus’ Chief Operating Officer, said: We are delighted to announce that together with our partner Rolls-Royce, we will develop and produce an enhanced A350-1000 aircraft with outstanding payload and long range, the best economics, and 25 percent lower fuel burn and CO2 emissions than its nearest competitor. He added: This will unequivocally assure the A350-1000 position as the most efficient aircraft in its category.

Mark King, Rolls-Royce President, Civil Aerospace, said: We are proud to power the Airbus A350-1000 with our specially tailored Trent XWB engine. Trent XWB engines currently on test are proving it to be the most advanced civil aero engine in the world today. The higher thrust variant of the Trent XWB optimised for the A350-1000 incorporates further innovations from our Advance 3 technology demonstrator programmes. This has enabled us to offer our partner, Airbus, a new, higher thrust version of the engine with industry-leading levels of efficiency.

The extra thrust together with an increased aircraft takeoff weight capability of 308 tonnes will enable airlines to fly the new A350-1000 approximately 400nm further with a full load of 350 passengers, or carry around 4.5 extra tonnes of payload at a given range. The A350-1000 payload-range capability will perfectly support the development of long haul-routes for emerging markets such as Shanghai-Boston or Paris-Santiago, as well as more traditional ones like Manchester-Los Angeles or Dubai-Melbourne, while burning 25 percent less fuel than its nearest competitor.

The A350 XWB Family consists of three passenger versions with true long-range capability. Offering three different sizes, airlines can best match their A350 XWB fleets to route capacity demands, guaranteeing optimum revenue potential. The A350-1000 is the largest of these and will typically accommodate 350 seats. To date, four key customers have ordered a total of 75 A350-1000s. Airbus forecasts a demand over the next 20 years for around 5,800 new twin-aisle mid-size passenger aircraft.

Airbus does not expect any impact on 2011 earnings."
A380 Wing Clips Building While Taxiing at Le Bourget - FLYING,"Thu, 23 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZseWluZ21hZy5jb20vYWlyY3JhZnQtamV0cy1hMzgwLXdpbmctY2xpcHMtYnVpbGRpbmctd2hpbGUtdGF4aWluZy1sZS1ib3VyZ2V0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The super-massive Airbus A380 has had another run in with a stationary object, but this time it was a building at Le Bourget Airport on the eve of the Paris Air Show rather than a commuter jet. Still, the taxiway incident, in which the A380’s right wingtip was sheared off on June 19 as it cut into a Le Bourget Airport building, was eerily reminiscent of an incident at JFK in April. In that made-for-YouTube-episode, an Air France A380’s wing was seen clipping the tail of a Bombardier regional jet and spinning the smaller airplane a full 90-degrees.

Nobody was hurt in either incident, but the mishaps prove what many detractors predicted when the Airbus super-jumbo jet entered service in 2007: the A380 is simply too big to safely maneuver at many airports.

That was certainly the case at Le Bourget on Sunday. Cleared onto Taxiway Victor, the A380 was rolling on the centerline when it ran afoul with a building owned by Aeroports de Paris. In a statement, Airbus explained that its A380 demonstrator’s wingtip had “touched” a building at the show site. Perhaps there was some error in translation from French to English, because photos of the incident clearly show the A380’s wingtip deeply dug into the building just below its roofline. The event prompted a reader to quip on Flying’s Facebook page, “The A380 Death Star claims another victim.”

Korean Air allowed Airbus to perform in the Paris flying display with one of its A380s, at the show to feature a new interior. That airplane fared better while taxiing, but still barely cleared an observation deck near the aircraft parking area.

The 100-passenger aircraft will fly 20 miles above the Earth and break Mach 4. At that velocity, the usual eight hour flight from New York City to London would take just one hour -- less than half the time it took the Concorde.

The ZEHST concept uses three different sets of engines: rocket engines for use high up in the atmosphere, ramjet engines (normally used in missiles) to boost the plane to speeds over 3,000 MPH, and conventional jet engines for take-off and landing.

EADS claims the jet will be eco-friendly too, running primarily off of seaweed biofuel.

But don't get too excited about taking a ride on this thing. EADS says it won't be ready for another 40 years and admits that some of the technology required to make this a reality is still being developed.

Suddenly there it was, the battered, wingless fuselage of US Airways Flight 1549, the star of what has come to be known as the “miracle on the Hudson,” rumbling by on a custom flatbed trailer.

“Look at it. Oh, I love seeing it,” said Linda Speelman, 60, a retired US Airways flight attendant.

When word got around that she had once flown on a plane with Capt. Chesley Sullenberger III, the pilot who made that pitch-perfect water landing in 2009, she became an instant celebrity among the overpass crowd here.

With its see-through aircraft cabin, passengers of the future will get a get a window on the world as they fly through the sky.



For this plane with it's 'intelligent' cabin wall membrane and interactive games, may be everyday air transport in 2050.



The futuristic concept for travel in 40 years' time was yesterday unveiled in London by Airbus - and it'll terrify those who already have a fear of flying.

Window on the world: Gone are the small aircraft windows in the 'vitalising zone' which provides a panoramic view for passengers

Flight of fancy? Artists impression of an x-ray of an 'intelligent' concept cabin of an aircraft of the future

First, business and economy cabins are replaced by zones for relaxation in the front, work in the back, and a fully-stocked bar for socialising.

Passengers will be able to see everything to the sides and in front of them. So blindfolds might be handy come take-off and landing time.



The aircraft's walls change according to light conditions. There are holographic pop-up gaming displays and in-flight entertainment powered by the heat of passengers' bodies.

The technology could mean travellers might even be able to read bedtime stories to their children back home.

Most of the basic technology such as moulding seats and 'head-up displays' already exist, but how Airbus plan to make the plant-based, transparent 'skin' of the plane remains a mystery.

Starry skies: The cabin wall membrane controls air temperature and can become transparent to give passengers views throughout the day and night

Voyage of discovery: Artist's impression of how the aircraft of 2050 will look on the outside at night

The concept cabin would be a bionic structure that 'mimics' the efficiency of bird bone, claim Airbus.

It would provide strength where needed, and also allows for an 'intelligent' cabin wall membrane which controls air temperature and can become transparent to give passengers open, panoramic views.

Airbus believes that mid-century passengers might be able to enjoy a game of virtual golf or take part in interactive conferences, while the cabin 'identifies and responds' to travellers’ needs.

The cabin of the future follows last year’s unveiling of the Airbus concept plane, packed with technologies to reduce fuel burn, emissions, waste and noise.

In the cabin concept, the 'vitalising zone' helps passengers relax, with vitamin and antioxidant-enriched air, mood lighting, aromatherapy and acupressure treatments.

Anyone seen my ball? Passengers will be able to play virtual golf in the interaction zone on the plane

In the 'interactive zone' there are virtual pop-up projections taking passengers to whichever social scene they want to be in, from holographic gaming to virtual changing rooms for active shoppers.

The 'smart tech zone' is tailored towards the more functional-orientated passenger with what Airbus describes as 'a chameleon-style offering.'

It aims to meet individual needs ranging from a simple to a complete luxury service, but all allowing you to continue life as if on the ground'.

Airbus engineering executive vice-president Charles Champion said: 'Our research shows that passengers of 2050 will expect a seamless travel experience while also caring for the environment.

'The concept cabin is designed with that in mind, and shows that the journey can be as much a voyage of discovery as the destination.'"
Airbus Military and Elta Systems Introduce C295 AEW&C - Defense Update,"Tue, 21 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTEwNjIxX2NuLTI5Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Today, Airbus Military and IAI/Elta Systems introduced their joint development of an Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) system based on the Airbus Military/Casa C295 medium transport. The companies announced the cooperation during a signature of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) at the 2011 Paris Air Show. Each party is investing tens of millions Euros in the program, expected to position both companies in an attractive position addressing the special mission AEW&C market. The aircraft, currently being fitted with a rotodome, will be equipped with a rotating 4th generation Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA), combining effective flexibility of modern AESA with the low weight offered by the single rotating panel.

The C295 fitted with a rotodome demonstrator is already conducting flight trials from Airbus’ Seville facility since June 8th. The initial tests have shown that the aircraft is aerodynamically an excellent platform for this purpose. Elta Systems and Aibus Military are now conducting engineering studies to integrate the mission suite, including the AESA radar, maritime search radar, IFF, ESM and other sensors, into the aircraft.

The new system will expand IAI”s position in the AEW market, particularly with the small and economically efficient turbo-prop powered platforms, which have an established market worldwide.

The C295 AEW&C has been designed to provide high quality 360 degree surveillance, creating in real-time an integrated air and maritime situation picture and electronic order of battle. The AEW&C situation picture is shared with friendly forces via network-centric datalinks. The aircraft positions Airbus Military and Elta Systems in direct competition with the Swedish Saab Erieye system, considered sofar as the lowest cost option for AEW&C. According to Elta, the 4th generation system developed for the C295 AEW&C has about four times more emitters, is more powerful, more flexible and offers overall better performance, enabling positioning the antennae to provide best coverage of a given sector (120 degree) or 360 degree hemisphere. In addition to the aerial surveillance and tracking capability, the system also includes a surface and maritime radar, providing naval search, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI). In addition, the system includes Electronic Support Measures (ESM) establishing ‘a new eye in the sky’. The combination of the rotodome and AESA enables high scanning rate, enabling the system to initiate tracks of suspicious targets in few seconds, regardless of the target’s aspect.

According to Domingo Urena-Raso, Airbus Military CEO: “last year at Farnborough we introduced the ASW version of the C295for Chile and this year we are opening a new market, offering affordable AEW&C. We are happy with the results from the trials we performed so far. Responding to the demand from military and HLS, for sophisticated, powerful and efficient yet affordable, lower life cycle cost we seem to be on the right track” he added.

According to Nissim Hadas, IAI Vice President, and president, Elta Systems, the reaction received from the launch customer is encouraging, Hadas said he was confident that the demand for the new aircraft will be substantial."

A futuristic airplane concept could herald a future where business and economy class give way to work and play areas on board the aircraft of the future.

That’s the vision of Airbus, which this week unveiled its ideas of the plane of 2050, complete with a ‘bionic’ shell which turns partially transparent to provide a panoramic view for passengers.

In the front, the company has integrated a relaxation (“vitalizing”) area, while the rear of the aircraft includes a “smart tech” space for working and virtual conferencing.

In the middle, an “interactive” zone allows passengers to move around a virtual reality cocoon, with the walls transforming to offer them lifelike experiences such as rounds of golf or video conferences.

Passengers will be able to enjoy seats that mold to their body shape, and an automatic bag loading system which delivers hand luggage to the correct place above their seat.

Some of this technology simply doesn’t exist yet, but in many cases the airline is building on ideas which have already been implemented, to some degree, by today’s airlines — if you can’t wait, here’s how to enjoy tomorrow’s technologies today:

Fully stocked bar: Already a staple of Virgin Atlantic’s offering, a place where business class guests can mingle, sip cocktails and tuck into nuts.

Electronic passenger identification using handprints: not used on aircraft, but used to speed up security by some airports (often as part of a premium package).

Mood lighting: available on some carriers and is set to become even more so — it comes as standard on the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner, set to go into service with All Nippon later this year.

Angled seats: A variant is offered in the new business class cabin on board Cathay Pacific‘s long-haul routes, where the long seats have been angled to point towards the windows to give a better view.

Seat canopies: Emirate’s first-class suites feature electronic sliding doors, while some KLM business class services feature “privacy canopies.”

Virtual screens: Not quite in cabins yet, but the size and shape isn’t a million miles away from the wide screens offered to passengers by Singapore Airlines, Etihad and Emirates (among others), some of which offer a view from the front of the aircraft via cameras mounted on the fuselage.

Virtual golf: Space restrictions mean this isn’t a reality yet, but Air France already offers a virtual art gallery using touch screens on board its A380 aircraft."

The airline will operate out of Kansai International Airport (KIX) in Osaka, Japan. Peach plans to start operations no later than March 2012 between Sappora and Fukuoka and to Seoul in May 2012. The airline has three major share holders: All Nippon Airways (ANA), Innovation Network Corporation of Japan and the First Eastern Investment Group. Although ANA holds a slightly larger share than the other two investors, I am told the airline will operate independently from ANA. According to the airline, the name “Peach” was chosen to symbolize energy and happiness across Asian countries. ’œThe name Peach was chosen to reflect our mission of becoming a completely new type of airline that links destinations in Japan and Japan with Asia,” Peach Aviation CEO, Shinichi Inoue stated. “Our promise is to provide safe, low cost travel 365 days of the year, making air travel easier and more accessible. Our airline will also reflect the smart sophistication that has come to represent the words ‘Cool Japan’.” Although the name might be “Peach,” their livery will be made up of purples and pinks. The colors are supposed to represent “cuteness, coolness and happiness.” Okay, we can go with that. At this point, the airline only has graphical representations of the livery, but an airline spokesperson said we should be able to see the livery an an aircraft sometime in the fall. The airline planes to lease brand new Airbus A320 aircraft in an all economy 180-seat configuration. The airline has shown some possible concepts of their flight crew’s uniform and they look very trendy, laid back and young. You might not realize that P.E.A.C.H. is also an acronym. According the website it matches up to the type of experience you should expect: Pan ’“ Asian, Energetic, Affordable, Cute & Cool, Happy. The airline explained to me over email that they, “are targeting a wide range of people, but much of our focus is targeting young females.” Is Japan ready for a low cost airline targeted at the younger and more female population? I am not sure, but it sure seems like ANA and other investors sure thing so. EDIT: I had originally stated Peach would be Japan’s first Low Cost airline, that is incorrect, I have updated the story. Thanks.

Was United Airline’s Computer Outage That Big of a Deal? I Say Nay. By David Parker Brown 18 Jun 2011 Most times I won’t cover stories that are picked up by the mainstream media, but I couldn’t help myself with this one. Yesterday late afternoon, United experienced a computer outage at their Phoenix facility. If you read most of the stories on this you would have thought hundreds of flights were cancelled and many lives were ruined. According to the AP, the power outages lead “to widespread cancellations Friday night,” creating, “thousands of stranded travelers.” Hmm really? Well Friday night saw 15 flights cancelled and then today there have been an additional 16. United operates over 3000 flights per day and 15 out of 3000 would not really be my definition of “widespread.” Yes, many folks were delayed and still inconvenienced but the world was still spinning. I think when thunderstorms rolled through Chicago recently more flights were cancelled than this. Of course, this matters more to someone if you are one of the stranded people. It just is troublesome when it seems the airline industry gets unfairly picked on when they are operating the most complex transportation system in the world. This is a multifaceted business and when you have an airline operating over 3000 flights and managing almost 700 aircraft, things will go wrong — that is just the nature of the business. It seems most people are willing to forgive other businesses that are far less complex for their mistakes, but rarely the airline business. When I am frustrated by the airlines I try to stop and remember two things: 1) Lois CK video on airlines and 2) What my trip would have been like just 100 years ago. Things can always be worse.

Cebu Pacific buys 37 Airbus jets worth $3.8bn - Yahoo Singapore News,"Thu, 16 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vY2VidS1wYWNpZmljLWJ1eXMtMzctYWlyYnVzLWpldHMtd29ydGgtMy0wNjIzNTg2MjguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Philippine budget carrier Cebu Pacific announced Thursday it had ordered 37 new Airbus jets worth $3.8 billion in the nation's biggest-ever aircraft order so it can expand across the Asia Pacific. Cebu Pacific chief executive Lance Gokongwei said his airline was aiming to fly to destinations further afield such as Australia, building on an aggressive strategy that has seen it become the nation's top carrier in recent years. Gokongwei told a news conference his company had ordered 30 Airbus A321neo jets and seven A320s, to be delivered between 2015 and 2021, in what was the ""largest single aircraft order ever made by a Philippine carrier"". He said the airline also had an option for 10 more A321neo jets, which can carry more people and fly hundreds of kilometres (miles) further than the A320s that currently dominate Cebu Pacific's fleet. ""These 220-seater aircraft will be a game changer for Cebu Pacific,"" Gokongwei said. ""We will be able to serve cities in Australia, India and northern Japan, places the A320 cannot reach."" Cebu Pacific's announcement came moments before India's GoAir said in Mumbai it had ordered 72 A320s, making it a banner day for France-based Airbus and highlighting the fast-growing muscle of Asia's low-cost aviation market. As part of the region's low-cost boom, airlines have in recent years successfully expanded from simple short flights to medium and long-haul. While Malaysia's AirAsia X has been the pioneer, Singapore Airlines also announced last month it planned to launch a long-haul low-cost airline. Gokongwei said Cebu Pacific was aiming to see passenger numbers in its domestic operations grow 10-15 percent a year, with an even more ambitious target of 25-percent annual growth for its international division. Taking to the skies only 15 years ago, Cebu Pacific passed national carrier Philippine Airlines recently to become the country's number-one airline in terms of passenger numbers. It now flies to more than 30 destinations within the Philippines and 16 across Asia, all within a few hours' flying time from Manila. Gokongwei said he expected Cebu Pacific to fly at least 12 million people this year, up from 10.5 million in 2010. Cebu Pacific's fleet is currently made up of 25 A320s, which carry a maximum of 180 passengers, and eight small ATR turbo-prop aircraft. It already has another 18 320s on order to be delivered between 2011 and 2014. With the fresh orders announced on Thursday, Cebu Pacific's fleet size will reach 88 over the next decade. Cebu Pacific said the new technology featured on the A321neo aircraft, which include large, wing-tip devices called sharklets, and bigger passenger capacity would allow it to cut its fuel consumption by 15 percent. ""This means Cebu Pacific will be able to offer even lower fares to our guests and be much more competitive with anyone flying less cost-efficient aircraft,"" Gokongwei said. Cebu Pacific raised 23.3 billion pesos ($540 million) last year in the country's biggest initial public offering to fund expansion plans. Gokongwei said Thursday a mixture of borrowing and internal funds would fund the new Airbus orders. Cebu Air Inc., the carrier's corporate name, closed 2.18 percent higher to 86.85 pesos Thursday, minutes before Gokongwei announced the fleet boost plan."
"Comac, China's ""Real Alternative"" To Boeing, Airbus? - AVweb","Thu, 30 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF2d2ViLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NvbWFjLWNoaW5hcy1yZWFsLWFsdGVybmF0aXZlLXRvLWJvZWluZy1haXJidXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) has signed an agreement with Ryanair to develop the C919, a new mid-size commercial jet, and, according to Ryanair, the deal creates real competition for Airbus and Boeing. Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary said his company is “seriously interested in the development of a 200 seat variant of the C919 aircraft.” He added, “We are pleased that there is now a real alternative to Boeing and Airbus.” Aside from Ryanair, Comac is expected to attract serious attention in the Asia-Pacific market over the next twenty years. And Comac’s position in the market has at least one major company seeking to share resources.

Over the next 20 years, the Asia-Pacific region is expected (by Boeing) to seek nearly 12,000 new commercial aircraft valued at $1.5 trillion. Financially, that figure commands more than one-quarter of the total market. Airbus believes that through 2030, the region should command nearly 70 percent of the commercial aircraft delivered. Aside from any potential “home field” advantage in the Asia-Pacific region, Ryanair’s relationship could add an inroad and extend Comac’s influence in the European market. Comac’s C919 is expected to enter the market in 2019 to compete directly against the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737."

Put it into the Lufthansa Technik Hangar in Frankfurt Germany that’s how. While in Frankfurt for a 24 hour spiel to celebrate Lufthansa’s first Airbus A380 flight from Frankfurt to Miami, I had a chance to go check out where maintenance is done on the A380.

At the time, I have seen the A380 at a distance and even got to tour the inside. But this was my first opportunity to walk around the aircraft on the outside. It is surreal how tall it is standing next to it, but how at the same time it is so close to the ground. I am 6’1″ tall and my head was touching the bottom of the aircraft when taking the photo above. Closer towards the main landing gear, there is even less head room. From ground to tail, the A380 is about eight stories tall and just the fuselage is about three.

Lufthansa Technik Group is compiled of 30 companies world-wide that help keep Lufthansa and many other aircraft operational. Lufthansa Technik has the ability to perform checks at 60 airports around the world and they are organized into six different operational groups which serve about 750 customers worldwide: Maintenance, Overhaul, Component Services, Engine Services, VIP Services and Landing Gear Services.

Three “out holes” for the A380. The larger ones vent out air, the center will vent liquid.

Before Lufthansa took delivery of their first Airbus A380, two large facilities were built for Lufthansa Technik to handle the new aircraft. One was in Frankfurt and the other is located in Beijing. The facility in Frankfurt was completed in December of 2007 and measures about 590 x 460 feet. The hangar is large enough to hold two Airbus A380s and one Dreamlifter as was proven not too long ago.

Obviously the Airbus A380 can hold a lot of fuel — about 85,000 gallons worth. Unlike most other aircraft, no fuel is stored in the fuselage and it is all stored in the wings. During the tour I was wondering how I had dripping water on my head and realized that I was being rained on via the condensation from the fuel tanks in the wings.

Buying the aircraft and building the hangar is just part of the process. Lufthansa Technik also had to get the tools, parts and people to make it complete. The facility has more than 70,000 parts in their inventory ranging from screws to engines. Outside the hangar there is a jet testing area, which was in use during our visit (but could not take photos since it was a non-Lufthansa aircraft).

During the tour of the facility we were able to get on board D-AIMG to take a look around. Since I was about to take a 10 hour flight in an A380 in a few hours, I decided to hang out more in the front of the aircraft by the cockpit. Lufthansa’s A380 are designed so there is an external door that leads to a crew sleeping area and lavatory for the flight crew. The crew rest area was actually the largest I have seen in an aircraft and didn’t feel as claustrophobic as others.

Some folks think first class is the best seat in the house. Although they are nice, they cannot compare to the seats in the cockpit. The cockpit is very roomy and it is hard to get a feeling of the true size of the aircraft. The flight deck is located in the middle of the aircraft, which doesn’t give it the sense of height that the cockpit in the Boeing 747-400 has.

According to the power systems specialist, which made the announcement at Le Bourget International Air Show in Paris yesterday, the new higher thrust version of the Trent XWB (pictured) will deliver 97,000lbs maximum thrust. This will be achieved by the inclusion of new high temperature turbine technology, an increase in the size of the engine core and advanced fan aerodynamics. The A350 XWB will feature Airbus' first composite based fuselage and wings. These will be made from carbon fibre reinforced plastic to help reduce fuel consumption and make maintenance easier. More than 70% of the aircraft's airframe will be made from advanced materials, combining 53% composite structures with titanium and advanced aluminium alloys. ""Trent XWB engines currently on test are proving to be the most advanced civil aero engines in the world today,"" said Mark King, president, Civil Aerospace, Rolls-Royce. ""The higher thrust variant of the Trent XWB incorporates further innovations from our Advance 3 technology demonstrator programmes.""

That aircraft lost a starboard wing fence and damaged its wingtip after striking a building while taxiing after landing.

""We've been looking for an alternative solution,"" said Airbus.

Flying the Korean Air jet had been examined as an option, the company said.

Using another test A380 had been ruled out because modification work for testing the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engine on the jet is too far advanced. Grounding of the display A380 was a ""left-footed start"" to the Paris air show, said Airbus. ""But you'll see us recovering.""

Dulles 1st area airport to offer A380 service - Washington Times,"Mon, 06 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b250aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDExL2p1bi82L2R1bGxlcy0xc3QtYXJlYS1haXJwb3J0LXRvLW9mZmVyLWEzODAtc2VydmljZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The busiest airport in Virginia now serves the fleet of commercial planes that rank as the largest in the world.

Washington Dulles International Airport on Monday became the first Washington-area airport to welcome Air France’s Airbus A380, a double-decker plane that can fit more than 850 passengers and dwarfs the normally impressive Boeing 747 jets in wingspan, height and cabin environment.

Travelers can now purchase tickets for the flight, which lands at 1 p.m. every day in Dulles and takes off at 4:40 p.m. A round-trip ticket bought a week before departure will cost about $2,000, compared to roughly $1,800 on a conventional 747.

The Airbus replaces smaller aircraft that fly the route between Dulles and Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport in France, said Robert Yingling, spokesman for Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.

The benefit to Dulles is the jets “increase capacity to a major European gateway,” he said.

Paris is the second-most-popular international destination for people leaving from the D.C. area, behind London. About 200,000 passengers each year fly from Dulles to Paris, Mr. Yingling said.

Monday’s flight was the first time an A380 arrived at the Loudoun County airport with paying customers aboard. There also was a flight in March 2007, before the plane had entered commercial service, to test the airport facilities, Mr. Yingling said.

The four runways at Dulles are capable of handling the jumbo jet, and only minor modifications such as the relocation of some lights and signs and the widening of taxiway shoulders were needed to adjust for the plane’s “very wide wingspan,” Mr. Yingling said.

The A380 is 238 feet long, 79 feet tall and has a wing span of 261 feet, about 3/4 the length of a football field.

Depending on how the plane is divided by ticket and class prices, the plane can hold 525 to 850 passengers. The Airbus’ two-floor cabin has lounge areas, private bunks and bars where passengers can sidle up for a drink poured by a bartender.

The Airbus A380 also has a place in the fleets of Emirates Airline, Qantas and Lufthansa, airlines known for their lengthy cross-ocean flights.

Airbus unveils the aircraft cabin of 2050 – Business Traveller - Business Traveller,"Tue, 14 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzdHJhdmVsbGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMTEvMDYvMTQvYWlyYnVzLXVudmVpbHMtdGhlLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWNhYmluLW9mLTIwNTAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has unveiled its new “invisible” concept cabin of 2050, providing passengers with unobstructed views of the skies – an innovation that will definitely not be for the weak-hearted, vertigo prone traveller.

According to Airbus’ Passenger 2050 survey, almost a third of the respondents said “they want the flight itself to feel like a holiday experience.” Part of achieving this would include a biopolymer membrane, which would be lighter and more fuel-efficient, as well as offering “panoramic views of the world outside through large areas where the lining can become transparent at the wave of a hand.”

Other innovations would include an “intelligent” morphing seat that would adapt to each passenger’s size and demands, offering massage, drinks or vitamins if needed. These would be necessary given the growing number of female travellers, passengers above 60 years old and obese travellers, states Airbus. With research showing that obesity in America alone is expected to reach 65 percent by 2050, it believes that “with more people travelling and their size, shapes and needs changing, aircraft cabins need to change right alongside them”.

The new aircraft will also do away with the three-class seating system and instead, opt for zones, such as an interaction zone, to target the passenger’s more specific needs. For example, there will be bars, a virtual gaming wall and other areas in the interaction zone, allowing more interaction and even meetings.

The aircraft itself will have longer and slimmer wings to reduce drag, lightweight materials and, of course, more fuel-efficient engines.

Planemaker Airbus celebrated a $US72 billion ($A68 billion) haul of orders, including the biggest single airliner deal in history, in a home turf victory over US rival Boeing at the Paris Air Show yesterday.

""This success sets a new record for any commercial aircraft manufacturer at any air show ever,"" Airbus said, after confirming Malaysia's AirAsia would buy 200 of its A320neo medium-haul jets for $US18.2 billion (12.7 billion euros).

AirAsia's agreement is the largest ever order for the A320 family.

Fernandes told Flightglobal that he would not convert any of AirAsia's current A320 backlog. The deal means the carrier's A320 orders have reached 375.

""We're taking all of them,"" Fernandes said. Airbus had previously indicated that customers would be barred from converting from the baseline A320 to the A320neo.

It capped a runaway week for Airbus as customers illustrated the popularity of the re-engined A320neo by taking orders and commitments into four figures just a few months after the jet was launched.

AirAsia Group chief executive Tony Fernandes joked that he signed the deal on Valentine's Day, after encouraging Airbus chief operating officer for customers John Leahy to dance.

""John said 'I don't dance' - so I said 'I don't sign',"" said Fernandes. ""So Tom [Enders] said in his German paratroop voice: 'John - dance!'""

AirAsia's deal is worth $18.2 billion at catalogue prices, ranking it as the third largest, in financial terms, in Airbus's history.

""One and two are Emirates and Qatar but they don't count because they have oil and stuff,"" said Fernandes. ""We had to do it the hard way.""

Enders described the deal as a ""landmark"" and the ""strongest endorsement yet"" of the airframer's decision to launch the A320neo.

Airbus rewrote its order backlog during the show, with firm deals and commitments for 730 aircraft from 16 customers - not counting the IndiGo deal for 180 jets, which Airbus said it deliberately excluded from its show count.

This comprised firm purchase orders for 418 aircraft worth $44 billion and memoranda of understanding for 312 jets potentially worth $28.2 billion.

The airframer has achieved 1,029 total orders and commitments for the A320neo, including 667 at Paris worth nearly $61 billion.

""I have to admit I largely underestimated the market demand for A320neo before the show,"" said Enders.

""Le Bourget 2011 is a strong confirmation of our product strategy.""

Korean Air embarks on test flight of A380 - The Korea Herald,"Thu, 16 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhaGVyYWxkLmNvbS92aWV3LnBocD91ZD0yMDExMDYxNjAwMDg3M9IBOGh0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYWhlcmFsZC5jb20vYW1wL3ZpZXcucGhwP3VkPTIwMTEwNjE2MDAwODcz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"YEONGJONG ISLAND ― Korean Air’s brand new Airbus A380 superjumbo made a successful landing after its first test flight in Korea on Thursday.The event took place a day ahead of the world’s largest passenger jet’s maiden commercial flight to Japan’s Narita International Airport. About 200 journalists, customers and company officials flew on a two-hour trip to the country’s East Sea.The A380 has double decks and a passenger capacity of up to 900 in a single-class lay out and 525 in a typical three-class configuration, Airbus said. The Toulouse, France-based developer claims the airliner generates less emissions and noise than jets made by its rival Boeing from the U.S.On June 2, Korean Air became the sixth carrier in the world and first in Northeast Asia to add the much-touted A380 to its fleet. Singapore Airlines made the first move in 2007, followed by Emirates, Qantas, Air France and Lufthansa in turn.“We decided to order the plane to offer air travel experiences that customers have never had,” Cho Yang-ho, chairman and chief executive of Korean Air, said in an in-flight conference. “Through the adoption of A380, Korean Air hopes to be reborn as a prestigious carrier that they always want to get on board.”In efforts to secure space as much as possible for all customers, Korean Air put only 407 seats into the plane, compared to Air France with 538, Singapore Airlines with 471 and Qantas with 450.The national flag carrier also made upper decks only for the business class along with duty free shops, self-service bars and lounges.The latest A380 will be operated on itineraries to Tokyo and Hong Kong starting Friday and expanded to those to Bangkok in July, New York in September and Los Angeles in October once the company takes delivery of additional planes, Korean Air said.Operating a total of 109 passenger jets, Korea’s top airline is scheduled to receive an additional four A380s by the end of the year and five more through 2014.The decision made in 2003 on the order resulted from the company’s long-term management philosophy, Cho said.“Korean Air makes decisions based on our strategy that values long-term investment rather than short-term gains,” he said. “When we were privatized in 1969, there was no private airline except those in the U.S. Stable management following the early privatization enabled us to retain resilience and long-term outlook.”Early this year, the company said it targets recording operating profit this year of 1.28 trillion won ($1.17 billion), up more than 15 percent from last year, by attracting more premium-class travelers with the new aircraft.It projects passenger traffic to increase 8.3 percent this year compared with 2010 and freight traffic 3.8 percent.By Shin Hyon-hee ( heeshin@heraldcorp.com"

For flight passengers who battle with the feeling of being penned into aircraft cabins with little natural daylight, aviation designers may have found the perfect solution...a plane that is transparent.



The futuristic concept for travel in 40 years' time was yesterday unveiled in London by Airbus. The planes of 2050 could, the company says, involve aircraft with 'intelligent' cabin wall membranes and interactive games.



Window on the world: Gone are the small aircraft windows in the 'vitalising zone' which provides a panoramic view for passengers

Flight of fancy? Artists impression of an x-ray of an 'intelligent' concept cabin of an aircraft of the future

First, business and economy cabins are replaced by zones for relaxation in the front, work in the back, and a fully-stocked bar for socialising.

Passengers will be able to see everything to the sides and in front of them. So blindfolds might be handy come take-off and landing time.



The aircraft's walls change according to light conditions. There are holographic pop-up gaming displays and in-flight entertainment powered by the heat of passengers' bodies.

The technology could mean travellers might even be able to read bedtime stories to their children back home.

Most of the basic technology such as moulding seats and 'head-up displays' already exist, but how Airbus plan to make the plant-based, transparent 'skin' of the plane remains a mystery.

Starry skies: The cabin wall membrane controls air temperature and can become transparent to give passengers views throughout the day and night

The concept cabin would be a bionic structure that 'mimics' the efficiency of bird bone, claim Airbus.

It would provide strength where needed, and also allows for an 'intelligent' cabin wall membrane which controls air temperature and can become transparent to give passengers open, panoramic views.

Airbus believes that mid-century passengers might be able to enjoy a game of virtual golf or take part in interactive conferences, while the cabin 'identifies and responds' to travellers’ needs.

The cabin of the future follows last year’s unveiling of the Airbus concept plane, packed with technologies to reduce fuel burn, emissions, waste and noise.

In the cabin concept, the 'vitalising zone' helps passengers relax, with vitamin and antioxidant-enriched air, mood lighting, aromatherapy and acupressure treatments.

Anyone seen my ball? Passengers will be able to play virtual golf in the interaction zone on the plane

In the 'interactive zone' there are virtual pop-up projections taking passengers to whichever social scene they want to be in, from holographic gaming to virtual changing rooms for active shoppers.

The 'smart tech zone' is tailored towards the more functional-orientated passenger with what Airbus describes as 'a chameleon-style offering.'

It aims to meet individual needs ranging from a simple to a complete luxury service, but all allowing you to continue life as if on the ground'.

Airbus engineering executive vice-president Charles Champion said: 'Our research shows that passengers of 2050 will expect a seamless travel experience while also caring for the environment.

'The concept cabin is designed with that in mind, and shows that the journey can be as much a voyage of discovery as the destination.'

The airline expects to take delivery of them from 2015 and complete it by end-2020, said managing director Jeh Wadia. An engine selection between the CFM International Leap-X and Pratt & Whitney PW1100G has not been made, he added.

Another 10 options for regular A320s have been firmed up, and these will be delivered over the next 18-24 months, said Wadia. GoAir's existing fleet comprises 10 A320s, and the orders will significantly boost its presence in the growing, yet highly competitive, Indian domestic low-cost market.

Its main competitors are the larger carriers IndiGo and SpiceJet. IndiGo operates a fleet of 39 A320s and, in January, ordered 150 A320neo and 30 regular A320s. SpiceJet has a fleet of 30 Boeing 737-800/900s, with another 33 due to be delivered. It has also ordered 15 Bombardier Q-400 turboprops.

GoAir intends to use its aircraft to grow its domestic network, saying that this remains ""underserved"".

""India will remain underserved beyond 2020, so (GoAir's) focus will be on the domestic market,"" said Wadia. ""India offers a very huge opportunity. China has 1,100 aircraft, while India has only 350.""

American Airlines to Update Fleet with 250 New Planes: Report - NYCAviation - NYCAviation,"Thu, 30 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55Y2F2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDExLzA2L2FtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLXRvLXVwZGF0ZS1mbGVldC13aXRoLTI1MC1uZXctcGxhbmVzLXJlcG9ydC8xNjM2NtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"American Airlines is in negotiations with Boeing and Airbus to purchase at least 250 new narrowbody jets, according to a Wall Street Journal report.

The new planes would replace more than two thirds of the carrier’s fleet, including all 220 McDonnell Douglas MD-80s and some of their 124 Boeing 757s. It is hoped that the new jets will not only result in lower fuel and maintenance costs compared to the older jets, but also enable the airline to expand service if the airline’s currently bleak financial status improves.

WSJ reports that American struck a deal with Airbus for A320 and A320neo aircraft several weeks ago and then took the offer to Boeing to request a counter bid including 737-700 and 737-900 models. Airbus’s financing terms were reportedly “very appealing to American” according to a WSJ source, including “significant discounts, creative financing terms and other incentives such as assistance with training pilots and mechanics, stocking spare parts and handling the fleet transition.”

While Airbus has been selling the more fuel efficient A320neos like hotcakes, Boeing has been reticent to reveal an updated 737 model before the year’s end despite the market’s apparent desire for one. American looking to place an order by this summer could possibly speed that process up.

It is not clear that either manufacturer could fulfill enough orders in the time frame American would like, so a deal split between Boeing and Airbus is also possible.

Since retiring the Airbus A300 in 2009, American has operated an all-Boeing fleet and has more of the Chicago-based aerospace giant’s airliners on order. American will receive 42 Boeing 787-900’s beginning in 2014, two Boeing 777-300ER’s in fall 2012 and several additional 737-800’s in 2011 and 2012."
Japan Offers New Low Cost Carrier Option: Peach Airlines - Airline Reporter,"Mon, 20 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMS8wNi9qYXBhbi1vZmZlcnMtZmlyc3QtbG93LWNvc3QtY2Fycmllci1vcHRpb24tcGVhY2gtYWlybGluZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Soon, Japan will have another Low Cost Carrier (LCC) option for passengers: Peach Airlines. The airline will operate out of Kansai International Airport (KIX) in Osaka, Japan. Peach plans to start operations no later than March 2012 between Sappora and Fukuoka and to Seoul in May 2012.

The airline has three major share holders: All Nippon Airways (ANA), Innovation Network Corporation of Japan and the First Eastern Investment Group. Although ANA holds a slightly larger share than the other two investors, I am told the airline will operate independently from ANA.

According to the airline, the name “Peach” was chosen to symbolize energy and happiness across Asian countries. ’œThe name Peach was chosen to reflect our mission of becoming a completely new type of airline that links destinations in Japan and Japan with Asia,” Peach Aviation CEO, Shinichi Inoue stated. “Our promise is to provide safe, low cost travel 365 days of the year, making air travel easier and more accessible. Our airline will also reflect the smart sophistication that has come to represent the words ‘Cool Japan’.”

Although the name might be “Peach,” their livery will be made up of purples and pinks. The colors are supposed to represent “cuteness, coolness and happiness.” Okay, we can go with that. At this point, the airline only has graphical representations of the livery, but an airline spokesperson said we should be able to see the livery an an aircraft sometime in the fall. The airline planes to lease brand new Airbus A320 aircraft in an all economy 180-seat configuration.

The airline has shown some possible concepts of their flight crew’s uniform and they look very trendy, laid back and young.

You might not realize that P.E.A.C.H. is also an acronym. According the website it matches up to the type of experience you should expect: Pan ’“ Asian, Energetic, Affordable, Cute & Cool, Happy.

The airline explained to me over email that they, “are targeting a wide range of people, but much of our focus is targeting young females.”

Is Japan ready for a low cost airline targeted at the younger and more female population? I am not sure, but it sure seems like ANA and other investors sure thing so.

EDIT: I had originally stated Peach would be Japan’s first Low Cost airline, that is incorrect, I have updated the story. Thanks.

Personalized zones replace traditional cabin classes to offer tailored levels of experience. While taking a hop between destinations, according to Airbus, passengers in 2050 could join an interactive conference; enjoy a game of virtual golf; read the kids back home a bedtime story; and recharge in a ""vitalizing seat"" while watching the planet spread out beneath their feet.

This latest installment of The Future by Airbus – a vision of aviation in 2050 – follows last year’s unveiling of an Airbus Concept Plane, packed with technologies to reduce fuel burn, emissions, waste and noise. The Airbus Concept Cabin now gives further insight into some of the innovations and technologies that will shape future passenger experiences on board.

The aircraft’s bionic structure mimics the efficiency of bird bone which is optimized to provide strength where needed, and allows for an intelligent cabin wall membrane which controls air temperature and can become transparent to give passengers open panoramic views.

The Concept Cabin has an integrated ""neural network"" creating an intelligent interface between passenger and plane. It can identify and respond to passenger needs and enables bespoke features such as morphing seats which change to your body shape.

New personalized zones replace the traditional cabin classes in the Airbus Concept Cabin to offer new tailored levels of experience. The “vitalizing zone” is all about wellbeing and relaxation allowing you to proactively recharge your batteries with vitamin and antioxidant enriched air, mood lighting, aromatherapy and acupressure treatments whilst taking in the infinite view of the world around you.

There are no limits to the kinds of social scenarios in the center zone of the concept cabin – the “interactive zone.” The virtual pop up projections in this area can transform you to whichever social scene you want to be in, from holographic gaming to virtual changing rooms for active shoppers.

The “smart tech zone” is tailored towards the more functional oriented passenger with a chameleon style offering, to meet individual needs ranging from a simple to a complete luxury service, but all allowing you to continue life as if on the ground. By offering different levels of experience within each zone, airlines would be able to achieve price differentials and give more people access to the benefits of air travel with minimal environmental impact.

Showcasing the innovative interior design, Charles Champion, Airbus Executive Vice President Engineering, said, “Our research shows that passengers of 2050 will expect a seamless travel experience while also caring for the environment. The Airbus Concept Cabin is designed with that in mind, and shows that the journey can be as much a voyage of discovery as the destination. Whichever flight experience is chosen, the passenger of 2050 will step out of the Airbus Concept Cabin feeling revitalized and enriched.”

Visitors to Le Bourget International Airshow in Paris can also experience the Airbus’ Future of Flight film, a 360 planetarium movie – a vision of the transformations in air transport between now and the middle of the century which not only focuses on aircraft designs and innovations, but also addresses passenger expectations.

The decision comes after the airline banned babies from the first class section of its fleet of Boeing 747-400 jets.

The baby ban will be extended to its Airbus A380 jets, Malaysia Airlines CEO Tengku Azmil told Australian Business Traveller on Sunday via Twitter. Requests from CNNGo to Malaysia Airlines for comment went unanswered at time of writing.

The airline ordered six A380s and the first is expected to be delivered in June 2012. ""We r planning to stick to our policy for now,"" Azmil told Australian Business Traveller in a Twitter exchange when asked whether the first class section of its A380 planes will have bassinets. (Read the complete exchange here).

Some Twitter users questioned why the airline doesn't try other nursing techniques, such as employing sky nannies and distributing baby blankets.

Defending his policy, Azmil said that while it was ""a tough call,"" it addresses complaints from first class passengers that they spend a lot of money on first class travel but are often unable to sleep because of wailing infants.

Instead, babies and their parents will now need to fly in the airline's business and economy classes.

The airline's 747-400 planes make long-haul flights between Kuala Lumpur and Sydney, London and Amsterdam.

On Wednesday, the Wadia Group-promoted airline announced a Rs 32,400-crore deal to purchase 72 Airbus A320neo aircraft.

Managing Director Jeh Wadia said the deal would be financed through a mix of equity, debt and sale or lease of planes. He said the airline had no immediate plans to raise capital or an initial public offer. Managing Director Jeh Wadia said the deal would be financed through a mix of equity, debt and sale or lease of planes. He said the airline had no immediate plans to raise capital or an initial public offer.

The GoAir-Airbus deal is the third big ticket order placed by an Indian carrier in the last few months. Last November, SpiceJet had ordered 30 Boeing 737-800s, followed by rival low cost carrier IndiGo with a record 180 Airbus A320 neo planes two months later.

The A320neo is a fuel-efficient aircraft with 15 per cent less fuel burn. GoAir will be among the first-launch customers of the aircraft and will receive 15 planes every year starting 2015, said Wadia. This is a firm order to acquire planes. The formal acquisition agreement will be signed during the Paris air show, beginning next week.

“We are Ebitda-positive and have made net profit for the last two years,'' said Wadia. The Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA) estimates that the airline made Rs 40-50 crore profit year. Wadia, however, refused to comment on the CAPA figures. Of the three listed carriers, only Spice Jet made an annual profit of Rs 101 crore, while Jet Airways and Kingfisher posted losses.

Wadia said the surge in fuel prices was not a hindrance to its expansion plans. “We are very positive about the aviation industry. There is huge potential,” he said. Existing regulations allows GoAir to fly abroad because it has completed five years but Wadia ruled out international operations in the near future.

Both in terms of fleet size and traffic, GoAir is smaller than its peers. Its market share in April was 6.4 per cent — less than half of that of Spice Jet and a third of IndiGo. Wadia said fares in India are cheap and expects a 10-15 per cent rise in fares this year.

Fares are dependent on season and peak travel months like November-January and April-June see higher fares compared to other months, he said. Wadia said the airline was also considering launching more 'red eye' flights (flights in wee hours) between metros. The airline hopes it will be able to attract passengers who opt for overnight train journeys to take their flights with low fares."

The smell of a burning engine, fire flickering out the window, passengers praying for salvation - it's a chilling scene that would send any flight passenger into a panic as they contemplate one final question: 'Am I going to die?'

That was the terrifying reality captured on camera by photojournalist Beiwhart after one of the engines on an Airbus A330 caught on fire during a flight with his wife and children from Singapore to Jakarta.

The flight landed safely, and passengers disembarked - one of them, with a frightening documentation of what it might be like to experience near-death.



Prepared for the worst: Passengers on Cathay Pacific flight CX715 prepare to disembark from the plane after it landed safely at Changi Airport in Singapore on May 16

In a story for Reuters, the agency's longtime photographer describes how he was drifting to sleep on the Cathay Pacific CX 715 flight on May 16 when two loud bangs 'like a bomb or truck tire blowing out' startled him out of a sleepy haze, and he woke to the tightened grip of his wife's hand.

'Do you smell something burning?' he remembers.

He describes a sharp smell filling his nostrils before flight attendants run to the back of the plane with food carts, confirming panicked passengers' most frightening thoughts. The description that follows is not one for those with a fear of flying.



'The plane started to vibrate, harder and harder,' Beiwhart writes. 'I held my wife’s hand tightly and looked at her face as she started praying. My two younger children were asleep, after their first ever trip abroad, but not Pradipta, the eldest one. ""Pra look through the window and watch outside,"" I said. ""I see light, I see fire, I see fire,"" he said. Then the electricity was switched off.



Thankful: The photographer's son, Pradipta (L), wears a life vest as he covers his eyes shortly before the emergency landing

'God, save our flight!': A passenger prays at his seat after the electricity goes out

'I realized the plane, an Airbus A330, had a big problem. I was afraid because I thought we would die. Pradipta looked into my eyes and asked: ""Will we die?"" I was afraid and could not answer the question. I looked at all my children’s faces and held my lovely wife’s hands tightly.'

After his moment of panic, however, Mr Beiwhart's journalistic instincts kicked in.



He explains: 'During my many years of assignments as a Reuters photojournalist, when flying I have imagined being on a plane that had a problem that forced an emergency landing, and then taking pictures. But I never imagined this situation with my family.

'But it happened. We will die together, so we can fly to heaven together, I thought. If we die together, I will not miss my wife’s delicious cooking, I will not miss the smell of my kids’ sweat. There will be no tears among us. My thoughts, to my surprise, stopped me being afraid any more. '

A flight attendant sitting in front of Mr Beiwhart explained the starboard engine was on fire, and the plane was flying back to Singapore.

Armed with a Canon EOS5dmk2 around his neck, he captured a series of stills documenting the scene: passengers storming the aisles with life vests, faces frozen in states of shock as they digest the thought this may be their final moment.



Touching ground: Passengers disembark the jet after it made an emergency landing at Singapore's Changi Airport

Taken to safety: The plane, which was en route to Jakarta, experienced engine trouble shortly after takeoff. Its starboard engine was burnt, according to the pilot

Mr Beiwhart noted he forgot his camera had HD video capabilities during the incident. ' After 20 years living as a photographer, I was thinking as a photographer,' he wrote.



His images, however, are a rare peek in to what is for many, a mystifying once-in-a-lifetime experience.



One photo shows a passenger praying, his head tilted at the floor pressing on his hands, clasped on the seat in front of him.



Mr Beiwharta remembered him shouting: 'God, save our flight! Give us your protection!'

Mr Beiwharta photographed his own son, shown covering his face, while a man sits in the row behind him, staring blankly ahead.



The plane made a safe emergency landing at Changi Airport in Singapore, when the pilot, Bradley Chiccame, came on the intercom to address the passengers: 'I am Captain Brad, the situation is under control and our engine fire has been extinguished. Please wait in a line and walk to exit through the front door, don’t run. And the ground crew will take care of you. Thank you,' Mr Beiwhart remembers.

He then disembarked, capturing the relieved passengers as they recovered from from hysteria, eyes glazed, faces reddened from tears."

Lufthansa bets big in Philippines jet servicing - Yahoo Singapore News,"Mon, 13 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vbHVmdGhhbnNhLWJldHMtYmlnLXBoaWxpcHBpbmVzLWpldC1zZXJ2aWNpbmctMDUzMTM5Mjk3Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A hangar the size of two football pitches is rising at Manila airport as the Philippines bids to become one of the world's select few pit stops for the Airbus A380, the world's biggest commercial jet. Lufthansa Technik Philippines is building the $30 million hangar, its third at the airport, to accommodate the new trend of larger aircraft, said its sales and marketing vice-president Dominik Wiener-Silva. ""What we're going to see is an increase in the average size of aircraft,"" he told AFP during a recent interview, adding that the industry overall was on an upswing after a difficult period. The German firm hopes to cash in on the small group of carriers that have made the first 60 orders for the 275-tonne behemoths but lack their own maintenance facilities. Only four sites worldwide can currently service the massive jet, which has a wing span of nearly 80 metres (262 feet). ""The Airbus 380 is a very large aircraft but it's not an unusually large aircraft,"" Wiener-Silva said. ""The new hangar will be A380-capable. It will be large enough to have the largest aircraft in the world."" Set to be completed early next year, the new facility ramps up Lufthansa's capital investment in the Philippines to about $130 million, he added. The core business of Lufthansa's Philippine unit is heavy maintenance. Once every five or six years, jets are grounded for 25 days and are stripped to bare metal to get all their many thousands of individual parts tested for safety. Britain's Virgin Atlantic is its biggest customer, along with the likes of the long-haul budget carrier Air Asia X, Cathay Pacific, Etihad, Japan Airlines, Korean Air, Qantas and Saudi Airlines. Twenty other airlines also have their line maintenance at Lufthansa's expanding Manila base for Airbus aircraft as well as the ATR 72-500, the short-haul turboprop favoured by many budget airlines. Line maintenance is a lighter, 24-hour safety check that regulators require once every 18 months. Lufthansa offers other types of services at its 30-plus units around the world, including one in southern China that specialises in thrust reversers and other composite-material components. ""After some very difficult years in 2009 and 2010 we certainly see signs of an upturn,"" Wiener-Silva said. ""Airlines, especially in Asia, are picking up fast. We're actually seeing the strongest growth worldwide in the Middle East and Asia."" Aircraft maintenance accounts for about 10-12 percent of airline operating costs, and the local unit, the largest majority-owned Lufthansa unit outside Germany, has tidy revenues of about $200 million yearly, said Wiener-Silva. But the 2,700-strong workforce -- almost all of whom are Filipinos -- is what makes the firm stand out, he said. ""In aircraft maintenance you will always encounter the unpredictable. It's not a standard production process and if you look for defects you require solutions,"" Wiener-Silva said. ""Filipinos are really passionate about finding the solution, getting the aircraft fixed and making the customer happy."" Wiener-Silva said the Philippines was unique in the region for its English-speaking population and extensive network of aviation schools that supply Lufthansa's local workforce. ""That is different from other up-and-coming countries like India and China -- you won't find that infrastructure,"" he said. New graduates who go to work for Lufthansa Technik are put through the in-house training school, where they undergo a further 1.5 years of hands-on training before they are entrusted with the multi-million-dollar planes. The unit sees new business in cabin modification, both for full-service carriers, which are keen on issues such as improving cabin amenities, as well as low-cost operators seeking to improve efficiency, said Wiener-Silva. ""Even a mechanic needs to be able to differentiate between a full-service carrier, where the cabin is the important part of the product... and low-cost carriers, some of which don't even have carpets in their cabins anymore."""

The embarrassing — and expensive — incident on Sunday was in danger of eliminating the A380 from the aviation industry’s premier event. Airbus has been able to borrow an aircraft from Korean Air to perform stunts.

Boeing had just landed its 747-8 Intercontinental, the first time it has been outside America.

Rather than talking about why the A380, which can seat more than 500 people, was superior to the new 747, Airbus executives were on the defensive yesterday.

The world's largest passenger jet was damaged when one of the A380's wingtips collided with a building while taxiing on the eve of the Paris Air Show, embarrassing the European planemaker at the world's largest aerospace event.

Airbus scrambled to remove egg from its face by smuggling a 300 tonne superjumbo out of Le Bourget for emergency repairs in Toulouse -- anxious to show off the plane which was damaged in a collision on Sunday.

The stricken test plane limped out of Le Bourget with its damaged wingtip as dusk fell on Monday, taking off from a commercial runway unseen from industry chalets and well after most of the 140,000 visitors had left for the day, an airport source said.

Experts stressed Sunday's collision happened in a tight corner of the airfield, which doubles as a business airport and is not officially equipped to handle the largest ""category F"" aircraft like the 525-seat Airbus double-decker.

Still, the high-profile collision was a PR setback for Airbus as Boeing showed off its rival 747-8 stretch jumbo at the air show and stacked up 17 new orders worth over $US3 billion.

Boeing and Airbus disagree on the size of the market for their largest jets over 400 seats -- Boeing forecasts 820 deliveries in the 747 and A380 category over the next 20 years; Airbus expects more than double that.

Airbus had been hoping to use the flying displays to kickstart a lavish new marketing campaign for the A380 with a slogan painted on its belly, which would be revealed as the plane makes a steep turn on take-off during the display."

Incident follows collision at JFK airport in which A380 superjumbo was grounded after hitting private jet

An Airbus 380 lost its wing-tip in a taxiing collision with a building, just two months after another superjumbo was grounded for striking a private jet in New York.

The A380 super-jumbo was grounded after the smash at slow-speed at the Le Bourget airport, where the Paris Air Show is taking place.

The collision mirrored an incident at JFK airport earlier this year when a private jet was spun round after it was hit by the wing of an A380.

The aircraft had been scheduled for demonstration flights during the show but these have now been cancelled, show spokesman Alexander Reinhardt said Monday.

The incident was another embarrassment for the European planemaker at the launch of the aviation industry's premier showcase.

The Airbus A400M military transport plane also had to cancel a demonstration flight because of what the manufacturer described as a minor gearbox problem, although the aircraft will still make a fly-over during President Nicolas Sarkozy's visit to the air show today, Reinhardt said.



On Saturday, Airbus announced that two of the three versions of its new widebody jet, the A350, would be delayed about two years.

The grounded flights and delays cast a shadow over Airbus as it takes on its traditional rival Boeing Co. at the air show, where both are expected to announce a string of orders as they vie for the position of biggest planemaker in the world.

Qatar Airways announced an order for six Boeing 777 planes in a $1.7 billion deal at the start of the show Monday.



Beyond the rivalry, the search for more environmentally friendly aircraft is shaping up as a major theme of this year's Paris Air Show, the world's largest and oldest aviation showcase.

Plane-maker Airbus unveils 'cabin of future' for air travellers - Times of Malta,"Wed, 15 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzb2ZtYWx0YS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9QbGFuZS1tYWtlci1BaXJidXMtdW52ZWlscy1jYWJpbi1vZi1mdXR1cmUtZm9yLWFpci10cmF2ZWxsZXJzLjM3MDkyONIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A vision of future air travel, with seats that change to fit passengers’ body shapes, was presented by plane-maker Airbus in London last night.

Air travellers in 2050 might fly in an “intelligent” cabin and be able to read bedtime stories to their children back home, Airbus said.

Showing off a concept cabin, the company also said that mid-century passengers might be able to enjoy a game of virtual golf or take part in interactive conferences, while the cabin “identifies and responds” to travellers’ needs.

The cabin of the future follows last year’s unveiling of the Airbus concept plane, packed with technologies to reduce fuel burn, emissions, waste and noise.

The aircraft’s bionic structure mimics the efficiency of bird bone which is optimised to provide strength where needed, and allows for an intelligent cabin wall membrane which controls air temperature and can become transparent to give passengers open, panoramic views.

In the cabin concept, new personalised zones replace the traditional cabin classes. The “vitalising zone” helps passengers relax, with vitamin and antioxidant-enriched air, mood lighting, aromatherapy and acupressure treatments.

In the “interactive zone”, there are virtual pop-up projections taking passengers to whichever social scene they want to be in, from holographic gaming to virtual changing rooms for active shoppers.

The “smart tech zone” is tailored towards the more function-oriented passenger with what Airbus describes as “a chameleon style offering to meet individual needs ranging from a simple to a complete luxury service, but all allowing you to continue life as if on the ground”.

Airbus engineering executive vice-president Charles Champion said: “Our research shows that passengers of 2050 will expect a seamless travel experience while also caring for the environment.

“The concept cabin is designed with that in mind, and shows that the journey can be as much a voyage of discovery as the destination.”"

Luckily an A380 owned by Korean Air came to the rescue and flew one of their A380s t0 the Paris Air Show. Being the largest airliner has its benefits and challenges — this is not the first time the A380s size has been an issue. Recently, an Air France A380 struck the tail of a CRJ 700, causing it to spin out.

A spokesperson for Airbus told AirlineReporter.com that the A380, “took the taxiway it was instructed by ground control to take.”"

The haul from the first day of the show was an improvement from recent years despite a challenging environment for the industry, which faces high fuel prices, a slowing global economy and uncertainty caused by violence in the Middle East and Japan's natural disasters.

Airbus topped the totals, signing orders and commitments for 142 aircraft worth $15 billion at list prices, the company said Monday.

Of note were firm orders for 90 of its A320neo, a version of the workhorse jet that's been revamped to make it more fuel efficient.

Rival Boeing countered with more than $11 billion worth of orders and commitments for 56 of its jets, including an order by Qatar Airways for six of its 777 jets in a $1.7 billion deal.

Airlines are particularly interested in energy-efficient models at this year's show -- displays included biofuel and hybrid engines as well as a solar plane.

One star, Airbus' superjumbo A380, was grounded after breaking a wing tip on a taxiway structure, the latest in a string of embarrassments for the company.

The plane suffered the damage Sunday after a slow-speed collision with a building at the Le Bourget airport, where the world's largest and oldest aviation showcase is taking place, spokesman Alexander Reinhardt, of Airbus' holding company EADS, said Monday.

Airbus quickly found a replacement jet for demonstration flights during the air show, an A380 operated by Korean Air. But the planemaker is facing other setbacks.

The Airbus A400M military transport plane had to cancel a demonstration flight because of what the manufacturer described as a minor gearbox problem, although the aircraft made a fly-over during President Nicolas Sarkozy's visit to the air show on Monday.

On Saturday, Airbus announced that two of the three versions of its new widebody jet, the A350, would be delayed about two years.

The stretched A350-1000 is being pushed back to 2017 to give engine supplier Rolls Royce time to develop a more powerful motor that will extend the jet's range, Airbus said. The standard version of the plane, the A350-900, is still expected to arrive in the second half of 2013.

Airbus' chief salesman John Leahy defended the delay, saying the revamped A350-1000 would best rival Boeing's 777-300ER by flying 400 nautical miles further while burning 25 per cent less fuel.

""Yes, we were supposed to come out in 2015, but customers said give us some extra performance and we can take the delay,"" he said.

Still, Akbar Al-Baker, CEO of Qatar Airways, said at a news conference with Boeing officials that he regretted hearing of ""significant delays"" in the Airbus A350 program.

Qatar Airways is the launch customer for the A350, and is due to receive the first jet in the second half of 2013. Half of the 80 A350s that Qatar Airways has ordered would be affected by the delay.

""This will dent our expansion and fleet placement program,"" he told reporters. ""It is very disappointing to us,"" he said.

""Also we hope that the performances that they are today talking about is the right information and it will do what Airbus says that the airplane will do,"" he said.

Airbus' first big order Monday was from GE Capital Aviation Services, for 60 A320neo jets, a version of the workhorse jet revamped to be more fuel efficient.

Airbus has booked 390 orders and commitments for the A320neo since its commercial launch last December -- even though it won't come into service until 2015 -- from airlines squeezed by higher fuel prices.

Boeing hasn't yet chosen how it will respond, but top marketing executive Randy Tinseth said it would decide in the coming months whether to upgrade its existing 737 model or design a whole new plane, which wouldn't be in the air until the end of the decade.

Qatar Airways announced an order for six Boeing 777 planes in a $1.7 billion deal at the start of the show Monday.

Boeing and Honeywell are both boasting of having the first biofuel-powered trans-Atlantic flight, with Boeing flying in its 747-8 freighter from Seattle on a mix of biofuel and jet fuel, while Honeywell touts the ""green jet fuel"" it developed to power a Gulfstream business jet that flew from New Jersey to Le Bourget.

EADS will also demonstrate the world's first diesel-electric hybrid aircraft at the show, another leg in its strategy of cutting its fleet's carbon dioxide emissions by 50 per cent by 2050.

Skyrocketing fuel costs are a major issue for Airbus and Boeing customers, who will see their profits plunge to $4 billion this year from $18 billion in 2010, according to a forecast by the International Air Transport Association.

Given the fierce competition, Sarkozy defended European governments' support for France-based Airbus. ""Aviation is a strategic sector that the state should not lose interest in,"" he said in opening the show.

Airbus edged out Boeing at last year's Farnborough International Airshow in the U.K., racking up deals totalling $13.2 billion, while Chicago-based Boeing's commitments came in at $12.8 billion.

Those results were a big improvement over the results of the last Paris Air Show in 2009, when many airlines closed their checkbooks in the wake of the global financial meltdown.

Before the event, Airbus had taken in 176 gross orders this year, compared with Boeing's 183.

Based on 2010 deliveries, Boeing is the world's No. 2 commercial jet maker after Airbus. Airbus delivered 510 commercial planes last year, compared with 462 for Boeing.

More than 2,100 exhibitors from 45 countries have signed up to take part in the weeklong event showcasing both commercial and defence aircraft.

Europe's Airbus sought to focus on its order books after it suffered a clipped wing, faulty gearbox and delays to a new jet ahead of the aviation industry's showcase event.

Airbus is getting lots of attention for its A320neo, a revamped version of the workhorse A320 family of single-aisle short and medium haul aircraft -- but with more fuel-efficient engines. As fuel prices have jumped higher this year, the plane has become the company's fastest selling model.

Airbus said Tuesday it received a commitment for 50 of its A320neos from U.S. aircraft leasing company CIT Group. A321neos have a list price of about $106 million, valuing the deal at up to $5.3 billion.

The planemaker also received an order for 6 A321neo aircraft from Taiwanese airline TransAsia Airways.

Airbus began marketing the A320neo last December, and plans to begin delivering it in late 2015. It has already received over 400 firm orders for the aircraft and Airbus expects to have more than 500 be the end of the Paris Air Show.

U.S. rival Boeing also made a strong showing, piling up new contracts.

It announced a deal with Aeroflot for eight Boeing 777-300ER jets, worth $2.27 billion. Low-cost Nordic carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle announced an order for 15 Boeing 737-800 planes, worth $1.2 billion at list prices. Carriers often negotiate discounts on big orders.

Beyond the race to announce orders, Airbus officialized a deal with Rolls Royce to supply new, more powerful engines for a revamped version of the A350-1000, a stretched model of Airbus A350 widebodied medium to long haul jets.

Airbus said Saturday it was delaying the first delivery of the A350-1000 version by two years until 2017, because it said customers demanded a more powerful engine. Airbus says the jet will burn 25 percent less fuel than Boeing's 777-300ER, its main competitor.

Airbus and Boeing announced a total of $25 billion in orders, options and commitments as the show opened on Monday.

The haul was an improvement from recent years despite a challenging environment for the industry, which faces high fuel prices, a slowing global economy and uncertainty caused by violence in the Middle East and Japan's natural disasters.

Airbus topped the totals, signing orders and commitments for 142 aircraft worth $15 billion at list prices, the company said Monday.

Rival Boeing countered with more than $11 billion worth of orders and commitments for 56 of its jets, including an order by Qatar Airways for six of its 777 jets in a $1.7 billion deal.

It's also the first A380 to see the upper deck dedicated entirely to business class, although unlike Singapore Airlines' similar A380 layout the Korean Air configuration leaves room for a massive lounge at the rear of the upstairs cabin.

The South Korean flag carrier has already commenced its A380 services on the Seoul-Hong Kong and Seoul-Tokyo routes, with flights to Bangkok beginning in July, New York in August, Paris from late September and Los Angeles in October.

Korean Air has stuck to its conventional three-class cabin, eschewing the trend towards premium economy.

""Our market research has shown that premium economy often comes at the cost of economy and business class"" an airline spokesman told Australian Business Traveller.

""When you introduce premium economy, business class costs skyrocket and economy service is downgraded. We have put more into our A380 economy class and we're keeping our business class fares very competitive.""

With just 407 seats from tip to tail, Korean Air's A380 design is the least-packed of all airlines running the Airbus superjumbo. In comparison a Qantas A380 has 450 seats, Singapore Airlines 471 (or 409 in its second-series A380) and Emirates 489, with capacity maxing out at a packed 538 on board an Air France A380.

Korean Air says this isn't just about more space all around -- it also makes for faster boarding and disembarking, especially for business class passengers who can use the dedicated upper deck doorways.

First Class

The first class cabin has 12 'Kosmo' suites.

These aren't 'suites' in the same sense as what you'd experience on an Emirates or Singapore Airlines A380, of course – they have a much more open design, semi-cubicle design.







These are wide lie-flat sleepers surrounded by a hard plastic shell shaped like a bathtub -- a comparison made hard to resist when the reading lamp is shaped like a designer tap.

Each cubicle is equipped with a widescreen LCD display and Bose noise-cancelling headphones.

Business Class

The upper deck is the exclusive domain of 94 lie-flat 'Prestige' business class sleeper seats in a 2-2-2 layout, with a privacy divider between seats and a 15.4 inch personal LCD screen stowed in the armrest.

These seats have 74 inches of legroom, although that's well under the 80 inches on a Qantas A380 and will call for gingerly stepping over a sleeping seatmate to get out of or back into a window-side A or K seat.

Lounges

There are two -- yes, that's right, two -- lounges for these premium passengers.

The first, towards the A380's nose, is a small area where two people can gather for a chat or just to stretch their legs.

At the back of the upper deck you'll find the more spacious and salubrious Celestial Lounge, located where the Qantas A380 has its five rows of premium economy seating.

This area includes a bar which serves, among other things, six Absolut-based cocktails.

To top it off are new amenity kits created by exclusive agreement with Davi skincare -- with one kit for flights arriving into Seoul and the other for outbound flights, under the reasoning that your skin needs different treatment at different times of the day.

Duty-free store

Downstairs, at the rear of the lower deck where the last two rows of economy might usually be, is the world's first walk-in duty free shop (well, more of a 'showcase' officially, as you can't actually buy the goods directly at the counter) lined with high-end cosmetics, perfumes and liquor to catch the eye and prise open the wallet or purse.

Heather Cho, from Korean Air's Catering & Inflight Sales Business Division, says the area will promote ""new, existing and exclusive products"" from the airline's duty-free range, which will also be complemented by the continuation of the regular cart service.

“We will display the best-selling items across all categories such as liquor, cosmetics, accessories and fragrances,” Cho says. ""The whole design process was done five years ago and the planning took place before that. Finally it’s going to happen in reality, and that’s exciting.”

Each of the bottles on display is fitted with a heavy-duty magnet on the bottom to keep it in place during turbulence although the alcohol is also stowed on taxi, take-off and landing.

The showcase will be open for business for the duration of each flight and staffed by a full-time sales assistant. First class passengers will get first crack at it, followed by business class passengers and then those travelling in economy.

Economy class

The economy cabin features new seats designed by Recaro which slide forward as well as reclining. There's 34 inches of legroom, or three inches more than cattle class on a Qantas A380.

Each includes a laptop AC power socket with a multi-country universal plug, plus a USB port for recharging your tablet or smartphone in-flight, while the 10.6 inch screen taps into the same video-on-demand entertainment system as even the most expensive seats on the plane."

Air travellers in 2050 might be able to read bedtime stories to their children back home, Airbus said.

The company also said that mid-century passengers might be able to enjoy a game of virtual golf or take part in interactive conferences.

The cabin of the future comes close on heel of last year's unveiling of the Airbus concept plane, packed with technologies to reduce fuel burn, emissions, waste and noise.

With the aircraft’s bionic structure designed to mimic the efficiency of bird bone, the flying machine would be able to optimise strength wherever needed. The bird bone structure would also help in temperature control as well as providing panoramic views to passengers by turning the smart wall membrane transparent.

In the cabin concept, the traditional cabin classes would be replaced by new personalised zones.

The seat which the landscape in flight like an open car can be seen is also the concept design of the near future airstream plan advocated by Airbus





I develop aircraft and supply them to each airlineAirbusCompany has opened the concept design of a near future aircraft.



We have fairly advanced facilities such as seats that can enjoy the scenery in flight like an open car and multipurpose space that can go from sports to the meeting, and we are excited a little when we think about getting on board. It has become something to come.



For details of the near future aircraft, please see below.The Future by Airbus - The Airbus Concept Plane



The logo mark of the near future aircraft is quite stylish.





Although the appearance of the main body is not greatly different from the current airplane, it is distinctive that the tailplane is divided into two.





We are checking in at the ticket-less on this concept machine.





The aircraft is divided into the front and rear seats and the central common area.





It also automatically shows the position of your seat.





Baggage is automatically collected when placed in the counter.





The design of the seat is also slimmer than the current one, and the colors are also summarized simply. It seems that there is a gap between the seat and the seat, which is considerably more relaxing than the current airplane.





It is a mechanism to generate electricity from passenger's body temperature. In addition, it is also possible to detect the state of the body, automatically judge ""it is necessary to drink water"", ""need to supply vitamins"" and so on so that appropriate services can be received .





A monitor appears in front of you and you can see various information. The same thing is attached to the current airplane, but since the monitor is embedded in the rear part of the front seat, it seems that someone who stands out at the front seems useful.





The baggage that I put in the counter earlier will be automatically stored around the passenger's head.





Next, we will move to the shared section.





The globe is projected on the floor ......





It shows you where this airplane is flying right now.





This shared section is a multipurpose space that can be used in various ways. This is where I am enjoying virtual golf.





If it is normal, there is a meeting after traveling by airplane, but this aircraft can be held if it is a small meeting.





The table can be raised from the floor and used as a bar.





It is probably the seat which corresponds to the first class etc.





It was a seat at the rear of the aircraft, but this time I moved to the front seat. Because it is made of transparent material such as ceiling and windows etc, it can see the state of the sky in flight.





The seat self-restorates the wound and has self-cleaning action, so you can sit on a clean seat even for a long flight. Like the seat earlier, it seems that we are generating electricity from passenger's body temperature.





It seems that we can change the orientation of the seat.





If sunlight is dazzled, just by holding your hand over the part where the sun is plugged in, the aircraft that senses the gesture will drop the blind there.





The altitude of the mountains seen outside is also displayed on the monitor.





In the evening, the seat reclines deeply and the facade covers over each single seat.





Because it is expected that boarding of elderly people will increase in the future,Economy syndromeWe created this concept design to minimize the adverse health problems such as ours. In terms of current aircraft, especially economy classes, we use physical fitness for boarding, so it is expected to be able to realize the concept contents up to practical use.

The sky's the limit for AirAsia - WiT - Web In Travel,"Wed, 22 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlYmludHJhdmVsLmNvbS9za3lzLWxpbWl0LWFpcmFzaWEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"All eyes are again on AirAsia, Southeast Asia’s biggest low-cost carrier, as it places a firm order for 200 A320neos at the Paris Air Show, sets up a world-class aviation training centre in Sepang, has five new destinations under its belt and mulls over plans to fly to Africa.

And some wonder why journalists, especially those of us based in Kuala Lumpur, are giving AirAsia so much coverage. This is because this home-grown airline is making news, news and news – usually all within the space of one week.

Take Monday June 20, for instance. AirAsia hosted two press conferences back to back – one following the airline’s AGM and the other to announce the launch of its aviation training centre. And interesting news is usually generated from an AirAsia’s conference.

The news that raised eyebrows at the conference was when AirAsia Group CEO Tan Sri Dato’ Sri Dr. Tony Fernandes announced the airline would order 200 A320neo aircraft, Airbus’ upgraded and more fuel-efficient workhorse, worth US$18 billion at the Paris Air Show at Le Bourget.

Well, he kept his word as AirAsia placed a firm order with Airbus for the 200 A200neos, with the contract sealed at the air show in Paris. This is the largest order ever for the A320 Family and makes AirAsia the biggest airline customer for the Airbus single aisle product line worldwide.

This US$18 billion deal is billed the biggest civil aircraft order in Airbus’ history by the number of planes. And that’s another reason why AirAsia creates waves wherever it goes.

Fernandes said the new order was in line with the airline’s rapid expansion plans and its long term vision to grow its associates throughout the region. It is also to cater to expansion plans in the Philippines, Vietnam and other parts of Asia

“With the introduction of the Airbus A320neo, AirAsia guests can look forward to more exciting routes from AirAsia as we can now explore more destinations with the enhanced range presented by the new-gen aircraft.”

The A320neo (pictured right) with new engines and large wing tip devices, called sharklets, will deliver fuel savings of up to 15% and additional range capability of 500 nautical miles (950km), or the ability to carry two tonnes more payload at a given range.

The aircraft is also more environmentally friendly as the fuel savings translate into some 3,600 tonnes less CO2 per aircraft per year, as well as reductions in engine noise. It will lower operating costs for AirAsia as well.

Altogether, AirAsia has now placed firm orders for 375 A320 Family aircraft, with 89 already in service on the carrier’s fast-growing pan-Asian network. This will swell AirAsia’s fleet of jets from 93 to around 500 by 2020 to meet surging demand for air travel across the booming continent.

The 200 planes are expected to be delivered from 2016 to 2026.

“With the trajectory of 500 aircrafts, it will make us one of the biggest airlines in the world,” said Fernandes.

AirAsia’s current fleet of 93 aircraft is busy flying 160 routes throughout Asia and within Malaysia.

The additional aircraft definitely comes in handy at the rate AirAsia X, AirAsia longhaul budget affiliate, is spreading its wings. Earlier this week Malaysia’s Transport Ministry granted AirAsia X’s application for flights to five new destinations – Beijing, Shanghai, Osaka, Jeddah and Istanbul. But its much desired route, Kuala Lumpur-Sydney, is still out of its reach and remains solely the domain of MAS – for now at least.

AirAsia CEO Azran Osman-Rani confirmed the airline will fly to two of the routes within 12 months, but declined to name them until all regulatory and airport authorities approvals have been obtained to enable the airline to land in the countries.

Africa is next on AirAsia X’s horizon. Fernandes disclosed that a team from the airline was in South Africa, Egypt and Morocco to survey new routes, adding that there was a lot of potential in Kenya and Somalia.

“We will definitely fly to Africa at some stage,” said Fernandes, but did not elaborate on exact destinations and dates.

On the Asian Aviation Academy, the RM200 million (US$66 million) joint venture with CAE, a global leader in flight training solutions, Fernandes said it was aimed at training pilots, cabin crew, maintenance workers and ground personnel for airlines in the ASEAN region.

The centre will train about 12,000 pilots a year in the academy, with the number of trainees to grow exponentially.

Pilot training programmes will be available from July 1 while non-pilot training programmes will commence on October 1. Trainees from other airlines will also be accepted.

The training centre will start operations with six CAE-built full-flight simulators currently located at the AirAsia Academy in Sepang, Selangor. These include four full-flight simulators for the Airbus 320, one each for the A330/A340 and the Boeing 737 Classic.

“Our goal is to make the centre a prominent ‘aviation university’ and to make it the largest training centre in Asia,” added Fernandes.

Looking at AirAsia group’s performance in May the airline has good reason for more cheer and more plans for its expansion. The AirAsia group collectively carried 20.4% more passengers in the month compared to a year earlier. Its load factor rose to 79% from 75% from May 2010.

The airline’s passenger load factor in individual countries also increased – in Malaysia passenger traffic climbed 14.8%, in Thailand 32.8% and in Indonesia 27.4%.

China signs for 88 Airbus A320s - defenceWeb,"Wed, 29 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuY2V3ZWIuY28uemEvYWVyb3NwYWNlL2Flcm9zcGFjZS1hZXJvc3BhY2UvY2hpbmEtc2lnbnMtZm9yLTg4LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIwcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"China placed an order for 88 Airbus A320 planes putting a bubbling trade row with Europe over a proposed emissions scheme aside as it tries to to fuel economic growth.

Airbus said on Tuesday it had signed the deal with China Aviation Supplies and Industrial Commerce Bank of China .

The deal, worth US$7.5 billion at list prices and with deliveries slated for 2012-15, was signed by Airbus president Tom Enders and CAS President Li Hai during a visit to Germany by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, Reuters reports.

The visit came days after industry sources said China had delayed the high-profile announcement of a $3.8 billion order for 10 Airbus A380 superjumbo jets at the Paris Air Show to protest over European Union emissions trading rules.

Under plans to include international aviation in its carbon market from next year, the EU would require all airlines flying to Europe to buy permits for each tonne of carbon dioxide they emit above a certain cap.

While China continues to put the brakes on lucrative orders of European widebody aircraft, industry analysts said it seemed as though China was pulling back from a full-blown trade spat to protect economic growth.

Although it plans to start competing with Airbus and Boeing by building its own narrowbody passenger jets from the second half of this decade, China is still ordering large volumes of Airbus A320s and Boeing 737s to feed huge traffic growth.

Ordering A320s is also in the country’s interest as Airbus began assembling planes for the Chinese market at a factory in Tianjin, outside Beijing, in 2009.

While China typically schedules aircraft orders to coincide with political visits, the deals can be difficult to analyse.

In November 2010, China and France announced 102 Airbus orders during a visit to Paris by President Hu Jintao, but the manufacturer said only 66 involved new contracts.

In January, China announced final approval for 200 Boeing aircraft worth $19 billion in a boost for President Barack Obama as Hu visited the United States. Again, analysts said the deals had been in the works and accounted for by investors for some time.

Tuesday’s orders were all new and firm, Airbus said.

The Chinese premier told a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel that firms from the two countries had signed contracts worth $15 billion in all.

China is Germany’s fifth-biggest export market and the biggest importer of goods into Germany, with bilateral trade volume last year reaching 130 billion euros ($184 billion), up more than 34 percent.

Other business deals announced during the visit included investment by carmakers Volkswagen and Daimler and chemicals group BASF in China."
The best seats in Business Class on Thai Airways' Airbus A340-600 - Executive Traveller,"Wed, 01 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vdGhlLWJlc3Qtc2VhdHMtaW4tYnVzaW5lc3MtY2xhc3Mtb24tdGhhaS1haXJ3YXlzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzQwLTYwMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thai Airways has two daily flights between Sydney and Bangkok on A340-600s. But which are the best seats to pick in Business Class?

Australians heading to Thailand on business or connecting through the Suvarnabhumi mega-hub will find themselves travelling on the plane frequently, so here's the lowdown on the best seats aboard.

The plane

The A340-600 is Airbus' longest plane, a stretched version of their single-deck A340 series.

Thai has six of the aircraft in its fleet, with First, Business and Economy classes from front to back.

In booking classes and on your ticket, the A340-600 may be coded as ""A346"" or just ""346"".

The Business Class cabin

There are two business class cabins: a five-row section behind First Class and a slightly smaller four-row section behind the lavatories and galley kitchens, in front of the Economy Class section.

Business Class seats on the A340-600 are angled lie-flat seats similar to the first generation of Qantas Skybed, which you'll find on the Red Roo's Boeing 747 and Airbus A330 planes.

The seats are laid out in a 2-2-2 configuration. (That means seats A & B on the left hand side of the plane, then E & F in the middle, and J & K on the right hand side.)

For business travellers going solo, seats E & F are a good general choice because they have direct aisle access either side. So if you're an aisle fan then go for those.

If you enjoy looking out the window, then pick a seat between rows 11 and 17 -- rows 18-20 are over the wing, so the view won't be as good.

The best seats on the plane

Row 11: these bulkhead seats at the front of the first cabin, immediately behind First Class, will be the quietest on the plane. Since the Business Class lavatories and galley kitchens are behind row 17, and the First Class galleys all the way at the front of the plane, there'll be very little traffic up here -- perfect for a relaxing trip and a good sleep.

Rows 12 & 14: with no row 13 for reasons of superstition, these are the two rows immediately behind row 11. They'll be slightly less quiet and private, being further back, but are still a great choice.

The worst seats on the plane

Rows 20-21: at the very back of the second Business Class cabin, these are right in front of Economy -- with the bassinet crib positions immediately behind the partition wall.

Row 18: immediately behind the lavatory and the galley kitchens, these seats will have extra noise, and the aisle seats will likely be bumped into more than most. Skip them for an uninterrupted flight.

Row 17: these seats are immediately in front of the lavatories and galley kitchens, so they'll also be noisier than a seat at the front of the cabin.

15A 15K: these window seats have a covered-over window, so don't expect the view to be as good.

New Delhi, Jun 16 : Wadia group-owned GoAir today announced placing an order for 72 Airbus A-320 aircraft valued at about Rs 32,400 crore on list price, the second largest such order in six months.



With this order for 72 A-320 NEO (New Engine Option) planes worth USD 7.2 billion, GoAir has a total order book of 92 aircraft worth Rs 43,200 crore (USD 9.6 billion). In January, the country's biggest no-frill carrier IndiGo had ordered a record 180 aircraft worth Rs 67,800 crore (USD 15 billion) to meet its expansion plans till 2025.



GoAir, which currently operates 10 planes with an average age of two years, had earlier placed an order for 20 A-320s.



“As part of our Vision 2020, we have placed an order for additional 72 A-320 NEO aircraft with Airbus. These aircraft will give us a further competitive advantage of up to 15 per cent on efficiency, primarily gained from a much improved fuel burn,” Jeh Wadia, GoAir Managing Director said in a statement about the strategic initiative.



The company would take delivery of its additional aircraft from its previous order over the next 24 months. Wadia terming the placement of order of an additional 72 aircraft as game-changer for GoAir and the Indian aviation sector.



“GoAir has no plans currently to fly international routes. I feel there is too much competition, especially from low-fare carriers and I anticipate a bloodbath there. I wish good luck to some of our competitors who are set to fly international routes,” Wadia said.



Asked about plans to rope in a private equity player or a strategic investor, he said there were no such plans at present.



“We have no plan to sell a part of our stake. We also have no plans for an initial public offering. On a profit after tax basis, we are profitable and we have a positive EBITDA growth.”



On GoAir's performance, Wadia said it has achieved an an operating margin of 15.7 per cent as well as an EBITDA growth of 13.7 per cent. Its load factor stands at 82.5 per cent, while the industry average is 78 per cent.



The airline's on-time performance is 90 per cent, while the industry average is 88 per cent. Its cancellations stood at 0.3 per cent, against the industry average of 2.1 per cent, he stated.



GoAir currently operates 10 aircraft with an average age of two years which makes it the youngest fleet in India, he claimed, adding the company will take delivery of ten more passengers planes over the next 24 months.



Elaborating on the airline's order for the 72 A320 NEO aircraft, Wadia said “we are very committed to reducing greenhouse gases emission...in line with this commitment, this order with Airbus will ensure that we continuously reduce greenhouse gases emission.”



In terms of sectoral growth, GoAir sees a tremendous potential in India, which has barely six airlines with 350 aircraft catering to a billion-plus people, compared to China's 1,100 aircraft currently. Even with all the present orders placed by Indian carriers, the country would have only 700 aircraft by 2020, Wadia pointed out.



“Just one domestic airline in America, SouthWest, already has close to 700 aircraft. In terms of seats sold, one airline in Europe, Ryan Air, sold approximately 65 million seats last year, while the whole Indian aviation industry sold just 54 million seats.”



“With India's GDP growing at a brisk eight to nine per cent per annum, we see a great future ahead for the aviation sector, including GoAir. Our strategy is to fly those who currently don't fly,” he said.



The airline currently operates 133 daily flights across 18 destinations such as Ahmedabad, Bagdogra, Bangalore, Chandigarh, Cochin, Delhi, Goa, Guwahati, Jaipur, Jammu, Leh, Lucknow, Mumbai, Nagpur, Nanded, Patna, Pune and Srinagar.



GoAir's new Chief Executive Officer De Roni indicated that additional frequencies would be introduced on existing routes, without starting new hubs.



New hubs would lead to decreased profitability, he said. “It will be my endeavour to expand the operations profitably and continue to increase its route network. Our aircraft utilisation is the best-in-category, giving us an operation edge over others.”



The CEO also indicated that he would create revenue from ancillary and non-passenger operations. “We intend to tap small-and-medium enterprises as well as corporate travellers for revenue,” he said. PTI"

No A380 demo at Paris air show after incident: Airbus - SKNVibes.com,"Sun, 19 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHA6Ly93d3cuc2tudmliZXMuY29tL25ld3MvbmV3c2RldGFpbHMuY2ZtLzMwNTM50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Paris, FRA) - Airbus will not hold a demonstration of its A380 superjumbo at the Paris International Air Show after the wing-tip of its test aircraft was damaged in an incident Sunday, the company said.

""During ground maneuvers with the Airbus A380 flight test aircraft MSN 004, the aircraft's right hand wing-tip touched a structure near the taxiway,"" at Le Bourget airport on Sunday afternoon, Airbus said in a statement.

""Airbus experts are currently inspecting the aircraft, but it is already confirmed that the A380 MSN 004 will not perform the flying display at the Le Bourget Air Show 2011,"" it said.

It was the second setback for Airbus ahead of the show, which starts Monday, after it announced earlier Sunday that its A400M military transport plane will not make any flight demonstrations because of a problem with its engines.

The A380 -- the world's largest passenger jet with capacity for up to 853 passengers -- entered into service in 2007, breaking US rival Boeing's more than three decades of dominance of the jumbo jet market with the 747."

Japanese firms to join Airbus engine project: report - SKNVibes.com,"Sun, 19 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vbS5za252aWJlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXdzZGV0YWlscy5jZm0vMzA0NzLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Tokyo, JPN) - Three major Japanese engineering firms, IHI Corp, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and Kawasaki Heavy Industries will help develop a new engine for Airbus, a report said Sunday.

The trio will bring their expertise in carbon fibre technology to produce the world's first commercial aircraft with an engine made from the strong and lightweight material, the Nikkei newspaper said.

The Japanese firms will join an international team led by Pratt & Whitney of the US and MTU Aero Engines of Germany, tasked with developing the engine for the European aircraft manufacturer.

The engine will be for the Airbus A320neo passenger aircraft, scheduled to go into commercial operation from 2016.

Aircraft engines are typically made of titanium. It is believed that the use of carbon fibre, which is lighter, will enhance fuel efficiency by roughly 10 percent, the Nikkei said."
