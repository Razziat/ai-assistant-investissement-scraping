Airbus shows off Air New Zealand's A320 'sharklets' - USA TODAY,"Tue, 18 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTMvMDYvMTgvYWlyYnVzLXNob3dzLW9mZi1haXItbmV3LXplYWxhbmRzLWEzMjAtc2hhcmtsZXRzLzI0MzQ0Nzcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus shows off Air New Zealand's A320 'sharklets'

Le BOURGET, France — Air New Zealand's new livery was front and center at the Paris Air Show this week, but it was the jet's ""sharklets"" that were the center of attention.

The Airbus A320 was officially presented to Air New Zealand at a delivery ceremony here on Monday. The companies celebrated Air New Zealand's ""launch customer"" status as the carrier received its' first A320 with ""sharklets"" on its wing tips.

Malaysia's AirAsia technically was the first to fly an Airbus A320 with sharklets, though Air New Zealand earned the launch customer designation since it was the first to order one.

Airbus says the devices, which stand nearly 8 feet tall, will help improve fuel efficiency by up to 4% on the jets that have them. Sharklet-equipped A320s will be able to take advantage of a range gain of about 100 nautical miles or an increased payload capability of nearly 1,000 pounds, according to Airbus.

The sharklets are now an option for airlines buying newly built A320s.

Air New Zealand will take delivery of a total of 10 sharklet-equipped A320s."
Airbus' Next-Gen Composite Airliner Completes First Flight - WIRED,"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS8yMDEzLzA2L2FpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXh3Yi1maXJzdC1mbGlnaHQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A350-XWB flew for the first time today, taking off from Toulouse, France at 10:00 a.m. local time (4:00 a.m. EDT).

""The airplane is behaving extremely well... all on schedule,"" test pilot Peter Chandler reported during the flight, according to Airbus.

The flight marks the third time a new wide-body airliner has taken to the skies this century, and Airbus' second time, following the first flight of the A380 super jumbo in 2005. Today's flight met a goal Airbus set nine months ago of flying the new composite airplane before next week's Paris Air Show.

The first flight took off under partly sunny skies in front of thousands of employees and spectators in Toulouse where the main Airbus factory is located. The crew of six, commanded by test pilot Peter Chandler flew the early part of the flight with the landing gear in the down position, a normal procedure during first flights to minimize the chance of any complications.

Once the basic flying characteristics of the A350-XWB had been confirmed, the crew retracted the landing gear about 30 minutes into the flight while flying at roughly 250 knots (288 mph) and 10,000 feet. They also made a switch in the fly-by-wire control system from ""direct law"" where the flight computer does exactly what the pilots tell it to do, as if there was a direct mechanical connection to the control surfaces, to ""normal law"" where the pilot moves the control stick and the computer decides how best to actuate the control surfaces to complete the desired maneuver.

The flight did not make it all the way to 43,000 feet, as was initially planned, with the pilots keeping the new plane under 25,000 feet due to time restrictions, according to Airbus. The company says the higher altitude and higher speed points on the flight test card would be made during the second flight.

With a wingspan of nearly 220 feet and a standard seating arrangement to accommodate around 320 passengers (and a maximum of more than 400), the A350 is more of a direct competitor to the Boeing 777, rather than its composite rival, the slightly smaller 787. Like the Dreamliner, the A350 is being sold as an efficient, quiet and modern alternative to the other airliners in the fleet. Airbus has more than 600 orders for the new jet, and even more are expected to be announced next week at the Paris Air Show.

Airbus did manage to outdo Boeing's first flight of the 787 for the aviation geek community by broadcasting the flight live from the chase planes on YouTube.

Airbus says the fleet of five test aircraft will fly more than 2,500 flight test hours over the next year before the first production plane is delivered to Qatar Airways. The airplane that flew today, MSN001, will need 2-3 days of checks and servicing before it can fly again. This means Airbus could do what many have expected, and have the A350 fly over the aerospace industry gathered at the air show in Le Bourget north of Paris. Wired will be reporting from the show next week and will be keeping our eyes skyward for a look at Airbus' new baby."

Airbus unveils RFID 'Bag2Go' that can be tracked from an iPhone app - Future Travel Experience,"Thu, 13 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ1dHVyZXRyYXZlbGV4cGVyaWVuY2UuY29tLzIwMTMvMDYvYWlyYnVzLXVudmVpbHMtcmZpZC1iYWcyZ28tdGhhdC1jYW4tYmUtdHJhY2tlZC1mcm9tLWFuLWlwaG9uZS1hcHAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Share on LinkedIn LinkedIn Share on Twitter Twitter Share on Facebook Facebook Share on Reddit Reddit Share on Flipboard Flipboard Share on Tumblr Tumblr Share via Email Gmail Share on WhatsApp WhatsApp

[jwplayer mediaid=”10877″] Airbus’ Bag2Go prototype features RFID technology that can be recognised by automated airport and airline baggage processing facilities, and can also be traced using GPS, enabling passengers to track their luggage throughout its journey.

Airbus has revealed its vision of what it is calling “The reinvention of baggage”, a prototype ‘smart’ bag featuring an RFID chip that allows passengers to track their luggage during their journey, and could eliminate the risk of mishandled baggage for good.

RFID technology enables the ‘Bag2Go’ to be recognised by automated airport and airline baggage systems that connect the bag with a passenger’s specific flight itinerary, and in cooperation with mobile technology and other location-based technologies such as GPS, can track the luggage along its journey. The bag’s accompanying iPhone app’s ‘Find My Bag’ feature allows passengers to check whether their bag has made it onto their flight, and trace its location.

The Bag2Go concept, developed in partnership with German luggage maker Rimowa and mobile carrier T-Mobile, could revolutionise the end-to-end baggage process for the passenger. Yann Barbaux, Airbus’ Chief Innovation Officer predicted that an optional door-to-door courier service will collect the Bag2Go from a passenger’s home, before delivering it to and checking it in at the airport.

“You rent the bag, it comes to you, you pack it and then the bag goes to the airport,” Barbaux said.

“There are companies which already do this for maybe €25. We think with this system this could be done for €8 and it would still be profitable.”

Airbus, the developer of the A380 double-deck jet and the A350 jetliner, has explained that the Bag2Go is still in its development stages, but eventually could become available for just 20% more than its technology-less counterpart, and could also be rented from airlines and airports.

“The value for passengers is clear, but where is the added value for Airbus?” Barbaux asked. “That’s the point, we are really working on the business model today. We have the idea but need to find ways to get revenue back. The airlines would run the scheme, so it might be by licensing.”"
"Airbus comes up for air, responds to Boeing's Form 41 reliance - Leeham News and Analysis","Thu, 20 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMy8wNi8yMC9haXJidXMtY29tZXMtdXAtZm9yLWFpci1yZXNwb25kcy10by1ib2VpbmdzLWZvcm0tNDEtcmVsaWFuY2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus came up for air from the Paris Air Show and provided this response on the DOT Form 41 debate. Readers can now compare closely Boeing’s response to our queries with the Airbus response and draw their own conclusions. As with Boeing, we print their verbatim replies to our questions.

DOT form 41 Maintenance cost comparison

Boeing uses F41 data of the period 2004 to 2011 to demonstrate lower maintenance cost of the 737NG compared to the A320. Without debating about the relevancy of F41 data for aircraft maintenance performance and the “correctness” of the data, let’s have a look at the reported F41 data from the point in time when the A320 entered the US market (1991).

We see why Boeing is focusing on the 2004 to 2011 period, the reported data are at the first glance favourable for the 737NG.

However, the NG entered in the market in 1998, seven year later than the A320, hence at any point in time the graph compares aircraft with at least a seven year age difference. Is this a “like for like” comparison?

Let’s just shift the 737NG curve to the left, starting in the same year than the A320, in 1991:

The picture does now look quite different, but money over time does not have the same value and this is in the above graph penalising the NG.

To be fair the reported cost data need to be harmonised respecting the economic conditions. Let’s put all reported data in year 1991 economic condition:

At the time A320 entered the US market barely any MRO capacity was in place. This has changed over the years and from a certain point in time MROs started to make money with performing maintenance work on the A320. Competition started to take place between the MRO’s, which impacted the pricing of maintenance work in reducing the money spent for the operators. For the NG the maintenance market condition has not been the same. Due to the derivative nature of the NG to the 737 Classic a wide MRO base has been proposing maintenance work on the NG right form the entry into service in 1998.

The graph below illustrates this effect in showing the evolution of independent MROs in the US market.

Another fact leads to lower maintenance cost for the A320 compared to the NG. It is the solid structure, which has been fully fatigue tested during the certification of the aircraft. An advantage the NG does not have, because again due to the derivative nature of the NG compared to the Classic, no full fatigue test has been performed and certification of the airframe has been obtain by “grandfather rights”.

Some quotes from leading MRO’s illustrate the well maturing structure of the A320:

Conclusion:

· Instead of focusing on the “sweat spot” for the NG, data of the entire reporting period must be compared

· Comparing different fleet ages is not leading the sensible results

· Market forces e.g. competition have an impact on maintenance cost

The A320 airframe is better maturing than the NG and improvements on the A320 are showing tangible results.

Airbus' A350 XWB makes its first flight - CNET,"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvZ2FtaW5nL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXh3Yi1tYWtlcy1pdHMtZmlyc3QtZmxpZ2h0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For airplane enthusiasts, there's nothing quite like a first flight.

And for fans of Airbus' A350 XWB, this meant that Friday morning provided one of the best treats of all.

With thousands on hand near the Airbus headquarters in Blagnac, France (just outside Toulouse), its next-generation A350 XWB took off on its first flight this morning.

The A350 XWB is Airbus' response to three planes from archrival Boeing: the troubled but still popular 787 Dreamliner, as well as the 777 and 777-X. The new Airbus was designed to be one of the most fuel-efficient planes ever, thanks largely to the use of composite materials in 53 percent of the aircraft. The plane also was built with titanium and advanced aluminum alloys so that in excess of 70 percent of the plane's airframe was built with what Airbus calls ""advanced materials.""

The fuselage is built from carbon-fiber reinforced plastic composites, which gives the plane 25 percent better fuel efficiency. That's a major reason Airbus already has 613 preorders for the plane from carriers around the world. In addition, the composites mean that the A350 XWB should be easier to maintain and will better resist corrosion than traditional airplane bodies. Airbus touts the fact that the A350's wings, at 105 feet long by 19.7 feet wide, are the largest-ever single aviation parts made from lightweight carbon composites.

Plus, in a bid to avoid the kind of battery issues that have plagued Boeing's Dreamliner, Airbus is using nickel-cadmium batteries rather than lithium-ion.

Three models

Airbus expects to build three versions of the A350 XWB: the A350-900, which seats 314 passengers in a three-class layout and is powered by game-changing Trent XWB engines generating 84,000 pounds of thrust each; the A350-800 XWB, which could challenge Boeing's forthcoming 787-9 Dreamliner, and which has 270 seats in a three-class configuration; and the A350-1000 XWB, which has 350 seats in a three-class configuration, and uses the same engines as the A350-900. It can fly 8,400 nautical miles.

Airbus announced the A350 XWB program in 2006 and began construction on the plane in 2009."
Flying a Dream: Qantas First Class on an Airbus A380 — Part 3 - Airline Reporter,"Wed, 05 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMy8wNi9mbHlpbmctYS1kcmVhbS1xYW50YXMtZmlyc3QtY2xhc3Mtb24tYW4tYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtcGFydC0zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This is the concluding story of my three part series. Be sure to read PART 1 [pre-flight] and PART 2 [boarding and take off] of flying First Class in a Qantas Airbus A380:

Safe and sound in my Qantas First Class suite, cruising towards back to my new home in the USA, I was relaxed and enjoying myself. The crew was there to make my flight as enjoyable as possible and Ahead of me was almost 8000 miles of open sky and 14 hours of bliss, luxury and pampering.

I was nicely settled into my seat with a hot towel and drink from the crew and the majority of other passengers (it was a full flight today, 100% in all cabins) were hitting the menu pretty hard. After my indulgent breakfast in the lounge, I was happy to delay my lunch for a bit and get some work done. Pretty easy to do with the suites since they have power at the seat and a gigantic tray table; big enough to allow you to spread out any files that you might be working on.

After a couple of hours of relaxing and working, I was ready to start my gastronomic journey. There is one signature item for Qantas First Class guests: The Neil Perry/Rockpool designed tasting menu. Seven courses of goodness with matching wines at each course as well (not that I was drinking).

Bonus: Qantas First Class Menu Melbourne to Los Angeles

The full menu was amazing; Seared Scallops with Cashew and Chilli Ponzu dressing; Roasted Beet Salad with Goats Curd, Rocket, Peas, Toasted Almonds & Balsamic Vinaigrette; and the main course of Seared Beef Filet, Green Beans, Potato and Cabbage Gratin with my choice of accompaniments. Getting hungry yet?

The flavors danced all over my palette, different textures, different sensations making it one of the best meals of my life… and it was at 38,000ft! As each course went by, I was filling up quickly and I needed a break. Luckily, the crew were happy to fulfill that request. Isn’t that what flying First Class is about? What you want, when you want it? If you need to space out your courses — no problem.

I decided on a 30 minute break between the main and cheese courses (which was out of order mind you because I prefer my cheese before dessert). Another 20 minutes between desserts (yes that is plural).

After my 2.5 hour lunch (yes it really took that long), I settled into to finish watching my movie of choice (The Aviator). When the movie finished I looked at the flight map; we had been in the air almost 5 hours! Time had flown by and I needed to try and get some rest.

The crew turned my suite into a bed; a fully flat, 7 ft long bed. With lambs wool mattress pad, comfy sheets and a soft doona (or a duvet for all you non-Aussies) made me feel right at home. Switch the lights out and I could swear I was in a hotel bed (apart from the occasional turbulence bounce). Even though I can never sleep on flights (even with a flat bed) I still managed a good bit of rest and for those who can sleep, I am sure it would have been like sleeping on a cloud.

Eventually, the flight started to come to an end, but before landing, it was time for some more food for breakfast (how I fit it all in, I do not know). I was still sitting in bed, with my feet up, watching a movie, and had a soft doona covering my legs while eating my pancakes and enjoying the coffee. It had already been a long flight but was I really ready to give this up?

As the flight wound down, everyone started to get ready for arrival into Los Angeles. The crew were doing their rounds thanking everyone, helping them with questions about arrivals. What did I do to stay entertained? I sat back and watched the skycam all the way until landing at LAX. I am glad I was watching, since I was able to see that our A380 had to crab its way in, battling strong crosswinds (30 kts at 1000ft) before landing on 25R, a mere 14 hours after leaving Melbourne. Funny how the time zones work, since we arrived three hours before we actually left.

It was the most amazing flight of my life. The experience, the food, the seat, the service all mixed in to make it a sheer delight and joy. To be a regular passenger in this, would be way too much — I couldn’t afford it!

Thankfully I paid for this flight with hard earned points. A normal one way flight could cost as much as $14,000, but I can also see if someone has the means, it being worth every cent.

Why Airbus will dominate Paris Airshow - CNN,"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWFpci1zaG93L2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Story highlights Airbus and Boeing both expected to make large order announcements at Paris Airshow French government is known to pressure Airbus to make a good showing on home turf Boeing has two large aircraft programs in the works Embraer has been working diligently to line up solid orders to announce at the show

CNN —

At every international airshow, there’s a race to garner the most headlines, the most orders, the best visuals and the best sound bites.

Usually, however, Europe’s Airbus comes up the winner.

This is particularly true at the Paris Airshow (which starts Monday and runs till Friday), where Airbus always makes a special push to win the headlines war.

Airbus, of course, is headquartered in Toulouse, France, an hour’s flight south of Paris.

Government pressure

Aside from the aggressive competitiveness of Airbus Chief Operating Officer John Leahy, who can’t tolerate being second at any time and who rarely misses any opportunity to tweak Boeing, the French government is also known to pressure Airbus to make a great showing.

This 2013 Paris Airshow takes place this week. It's the aviation industry's most important event of the year. pierre verdy/afp/getty images file photo

Boeing conceded the point long ago.

“We know Airbus sees this as a competition on their home turf. In terms of orders, we see this as one week out of 52,” admits Boeing’s Vice President of Marketing Randy Tinseth, the company’s most visible communications counterpart to Leahy. (Leahy’s actual counterpart, Ray Conner, CEO of Boeing Commercial Aircraft, tends to keep a low profile.)

“Despite the wave of orders our competition rolls out at airshows, the market has still been roughly split down the middle over the past decade,” says Tinseth.

How do you pick up a ‘superjumbo’ A380?

High expectations

Leahy declined in a recent interview to predict how many orders he’ll have to announce at the airshow, but skipped the Airbus Innovation Days international media briefings on June 5 and 6 – an unusual absence – to go globe-trotting for orders in time for the show.

He’s expected to announce hundreds.

The A350 XWB – the new, composite rival to the Boeing 787 and aging 777 – is widely anticipated to make a flyover at this year’s event.

Some question the wisdom of even a flyby, as the A350 will have few test flights under its wing at that point.

Airbus sends first A350 XWB into the sky

But the French government wants to showcase the plane and so does Airbus.

Boeing strikes back

Boeing is expected to announce hundreds of orders. pierre verdy/afp/getty images file photo

Boeing won’t leave all its pizzazz at home.

The formal program launch of its 787-10 is expected (although Boeing won’t officially say so) and scores of orders are expected to accompany the announcement.

Singapore Airlines has already said it will take 30 of the airplanes.

British Airways is also presumed to be a launch customer.

Boeing is also expected to announce several customers who have signed up for “commitments” for the 777X, although the program launch is considered likely for the Dubai Airshow slated for November 17-21.

Emirates Airlines (headquartered in Dubai) is assumed to be a launch customer for as many as 100 of the new version of the venerable airplane.

Thus, with two new airplane programs and hundreds of orders and commitments anticipated, Boeing could conceivably “win” this year’s show.

But video footage and pictures of the flyby of the A350 will be hard for Boeing to beat with artist renderings and sound bites.

How will we travel 10 years from now?

Other competitors

Embraer, which makes the popular E-Jet in the 70-122 seat market, is expected to formally launch its re-engined design of the E-175/190/195. (The 170 appears on its way out.)

The upgraded E-Jet will feature new wings, new systems, geared turbo fan engines by Pratt & Whitney and room for an additional eight to 12 passengers.

Embraer has been working diligently to line up solid orders to announce at the show.

Bombardier, on the other hand, doesn’t traditionally do well at airshows.

Orders for its CSeries have been few and far between at these events, in part because Canadian securities laws require announcements within 24 hours of the signing of even letters of intent, making it virtually impossible for Bombardier to cluster announcements.

The first flight of the CSeries will almost certainly miss the airshow, but is expected the next week.

Bombardier will have to be content talking about tests leading up to the first flight, revealing an unidentified customer’s identify (possibly Odyssey Airlines, based on an executive’s slip of the tongue at an industry event) and perhaps some small order announcements.

So, with all this activity, maneuvering and posturing, who will “win” the Paris Airshow?

Airbus, of course.

Airbus A350 takes maiden flight | Arkansas Democrat Gazette - Arkansas Online,"Sat, 15 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMTMvanVuLzE1L2FpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXRha2VzLW1haWRlbi1mbGlnaHQtMjAxMzA2MTUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS - The Airbus A350’s maiden flight ended with a safe landing Friday, setting the stage for intensifying competition with U.S. rival Boeing in the long-haul, wide-body aircraft market.

The 4-hour flight from Toulouse marks a key step on the path to full certification for the jet, which can carry between 250 and 400 passengers and is the European aircraft maker’s best hope for catching up in along-haul market dominated by Boeing’s 787 and 777. Toulouse airspace closed for both take-off and landing.

Airbus has 613 orders for the A350 and hopes Friday’s flight will bring it momentum heading into next week’s Paris Air Show, which is already shaping up as a battle of the wide-body planes.

“We want more than 50 percent of this market, and we will have more than 50 percent of this market,” Airbus Chief Executive Officer Fabrice Bregier said of the estimated 6,000 wide-body planes to be built during the next 20 years.

More than half of the twin engine jet consists of lightweight carbon-fiber designed to save on jet fuel, which makes up half the cost of long-haul flights. The plane cost about $14 billion to develop.

The A350, which was delayed for two years as Airbus hashed out the new design, is a direct competitor with the 787 Dreamliner - minus the lithium-ion batteries now under investigation for unexplained smoldering. Airbus abandoned its plans to use the lithium-ion batteries despite their advantages in weight, power and recharging speed.

“The A350 has the same innovations more or less as the Dreamliner, the 787,” said Gerard Feldzer, a French aviation expert and former airline pilot. “It is pretty much equivalent, the same amount or proportion of carbon for the lightness of the material, just as many electrical devices.”

Boeing’s list prices for its 787 line range from $206 million to $243 million. Airbus’ list prices range from $254 million to $332 million, and it had 613 orders as of May, compared with 890 orders for the 787. Steep discounts are common on large orders, although the details are rarely made public.

Airbus claims the A350 burns 25 percent less fuel than the Boeing because of its lighter weight, redesigned Rolls-Royce engines and new aerodynamics.

“The first flight is a very special moment in an aerospace company,” Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus parent company EADS, said late Thursday.

Friday’s flight handled as predicted, test pilot Peter Chandler said after a 4-hour-6-minute round trip.

“It felt more like an aircraft at the end of its flight test program than one on its first flight,” he said, although some glitches will need to be addressed.

Powered by Rolls-Royce Holdings engines, the A350 reached 25,000 feet and a speed of Mach 0.8 as Airbus used the flight to gather data needed to achieve certification within about 14 months, flight test engineer Patrick Du Che said. The flight-test campaign is expected to clock around 2,500 hours.

Airbus test-flies A350 to rival 787 Dreamliner - USA TODAY,"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTMvMDYvMTQvYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtdGFrZXMtb2ZmLW9uLW1haWRlbi1mbGlnaHQtNzg3LWRyZWFtbGluZXIvMjQyMjQ0MS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus test-flies A350 to rival 787 Dreamliner

The Airbus A350 safely touched down Friday after its first test flight in France, a milestone in the company's effort to battle Boeing's 787 Dreamliner over the market for wide-body planes.

Thousands of people watched the flight in person, and about 60 Airbus workers celebrated at offices near Washington's Dulles Airport, applauding as the plane landed at 8:06 a.m. ET.

""Although seeing the airplane take off for the first time is exciting, the really satisfying bit is when the airplane comes back and lands,"" said Barry Eccleston, CEO of Airbus Americas, who wore a black ""First Flight"" T-shirt for the occasion.

The flight moves Airbus a step closer to delivering the A350 in the second half of 2014.

Both the A350 and the 787 are built from carbon composites that aim for greater fuel efficiency and less greenhouse-gas emissions. Cabins of both planes boast larger windows and overhead storage than comparable jets. Airbus says the 220-inch cabin width from armrest to armrest is inches more than the competition, allowing 18-inch seat width in nine-wide seating.

Airbus has 616 orders for the A350, including 50 announced this month from Singapore Airlines.

By comparison, Boeing has delivered 57 Dreamliners since starting in September 2011. Despite the craft being grounded for three months this year with battery problems, Boeing has more than 800 orders worldwide, including 42 this year from American Airlines.

Both companies will promote their planes next week at the Paris Air Show. Airbus will have its test flight under its belt, and Boeing will have two Dreamliners on hand, one to fly and one to walk around.

""With a huge backlog and a bullish long-term demand forecast, the commercial aircraft market should remain healthy over the long haul,"" Carol Levenson, a Gimme Credit aerospace analyst, said in a Boeing review.

The A350 is designed to seat 270 to 350 passengers in three classes and have an 8,000-mile range. The plane is projected to use 25% less fuel than comparable planes.

""It's going to be a really important plane for the U.S.,"" Eccleston said. ""People are really going to notice this.""

The four-hour test flight occurred at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport. Eccleston said test pilots and engineers were looking to see how the plane handled and whether equipment such as landing gear and flaps worked as expected.

""We were looking for the handling qualities of the airplane,"" Eccleston said.

Brent McBratney, Airbus Americas airline marketing director, said the flight demonstrated that the company could deliver on its commitments. US Airways, Hawaiian and United each have the plane on order, and Airbus will sell the 350-1000 version as a competitor to Boeing's 777.

""It was awesome,"" McBratney said. ""This airplane is really going to crank up the competition.""

Zachary Shapiro, Airbus North American sales director, said the ""game-changing"" plane represents the company's future.

""For lack of a more sophisticated word, I'm giddy,"" Shapiro said. ""This is the future flagship of fleets. To see a first flight happen, it's the beginning of a long era in aviation."""
Airbus v Boeing on wide bodies - Leeham News and Analysis,"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMy8wNi8xNC9haXJidXMtdi1ib2Vpbmctb24td2lkZS1ib2RpZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus and Boeing don’t confine their comparisons to the A320 v 737. They are equally forthcoming in discussing the wide-body strategies.

The pre-Paris Air Show briefings included contrasts in how Airbus and Boeing see the wide-body strategies.

Airbus views the product line-up this way:



Boeing views the product line up this week. We added the seat gap counts and arrows, because Boeing appears to use a slightly higher seat gap count for the A380 than does Airbus vis-a-vis the A350. We added the seat gap count between the 777-9X and the 747-8I, based on Boeing’s publicly stated assumed seat counts.

.

In these examples, we favor the Boeing view (though with the Airbus A380 seat count) as to the market gaps. We do not see the A350-1000 competing with the 777-9X.

Airbus Fires Up the Engines on Its New Composite Airliner - WIRED,"Mon, 03 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS8yMDEzLzA2L2FpcmJ1cy1maXJzdC1lbmdpbmUtcnVuL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is one step closer to the first flight of its newest airliner after firing up the engines of the A350-XWB over the weekend. The timing isn't entirely coincidental, with the Paris Air Show just two weeks away. However, the company said that a first flight of its new composite airliner will not be dictated by the air show, but many in the industry are expecting an aerial appearance in France.

Like Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, the A350-XWB is a mostly composite aircraft designed to provide significant fuel savings over similarly sized models. The prototype, known as MSN1, was turned over to Airbus' flight test team last month.

On Sunday the company fired up the Rolls Royce engines for the first time, renewing speculation about an imminent first flight. But at an industry conference in South Africa, Airbus' chief operating officer John Leahy again said the company will not rush the first flight.

""We'll do it when we're ready to do it,"" Leahy said in a story by Aviation Week. He managed to get a jab in at his main rival when explaining the reasoning for not selecting a predetermined date. ""We are not going to fall victim like Boeing did with the 787.""

Large twin-aisle, twin-engine airliners such as the A350, 777 and 787 are seen by many in the airline industry as the future for long-haul flights. Largely thanks to the efficient new engines used on the airplanes, airlines are ordering relatively large numbers of the new planes compared to past four-engine jets in an effort to reduce the fuel bill on the longer routes. Four-engine airplanes -- such as the 747 and A380 -- are not selling as well as airlines enable longer routes connecting two cities directly, rather than running flights through massive hub airports.

In addition to the new A350-XWB, Boeing announced last month that it will be updating the 777. The new airplane, simply called the 777X at this point, will have an all-new composite wing, as well as new engines and other updates in an effort to maintain its market dominance and stay competitive in the increasingly efficient big-jet market."

Airbus hinted that its new A350 could help cap off the 2013 Paris Air Show with an overhead fly-by.

Airbus said via Twitter this morning (June 20) a fly-by of its A350 ""looks like a good possibility for tomorrow at the air show!""

The jet, of course, just made its maiden flight this past Thursday with a test flight over France. The jet has must undergo most test flying before it can win certification to begin commercial passenger flights.

Airbus projects delivering its first A350 to an airline customer in the second half of next year.

Still, the A350 has been a hot topic at this week's Paris Air Show, where the intensifying competition between Boeing and Airbus over the widebody aircraft market has been on full display.

Boeing officially confirmed the launch of its Boeing 787-10, a stretch version of its new-age Dreamliner that will be its biggest one yet. Boeing also landed new orders for its 777 model as well as announcing upgrades for that line of aircraft.

Airbus is offering its A350 as competition to both the Boeing Dreamliner and to the smaller versions of Boeing's 777s.

Airbus also has secured a number of new orders for its A350 at the 2013 Paris Air Show, including one on Thursday from United Airlines."

LE BOURGET, France (AP) - Airbus raked in orders Wednesday for its new A350, announcing 59 sales of the wide-body jet that flew for the first time last week.

Singapore Airlines ordered 30 A350-900s, with an option to buy another 20 of the 900s or the larger 1000 model. The airline had already ordered 20 of the A350.

Air France-KLM also put in an order for 25 A350 jets, saying the plane will be central to its plan to expand long-haul flights after years of struggling against discount carriers in Europe.

Airbus also announced that SriLankan Airlines, the country's national carrier, would buy four A350s and six slightly smaller A330 jets.

Wednesday's announcements at the Paris Air Show represent a vote of confidence in the A350, which Airbus is hoping will help it catch up to Boeing's popular 787 and 777 in the lucrative field of long-haul wide-body jets. The A350, which typically seats 314 passengers, has a list price of $287.7 million; the A330, which doesn't fly as far as the A350, has a list price of $239.4 million.

The A350 makes extensive use of lightweight carbon fiber, at a time when fuel costs are a major concern. Potential customers at the air show haven't been able to see the plane at Le Bourget - the plane is not yet cleared for flight there. First deliveries of the plane are expected in mid-2014.

The SriLankan Airlines' deal is worth around $2.8 billion at list prices, while Singapore Airline's firm order is worth $8.6 billion at list prices.

The Air France deal is worth around $7.2 billion at list prices but customers can negotiate steep discounts. It's a major investment for the airline, which has posted operating losses over the past couple of years.

The purchase fits in with Air France-KLMs hope to shift away from the cutthroat short-haul market. ""This year is a pivotal year for their recovery plan,"" said Robin Byde, an analyst with Cantor Fitzgerald Europe.

Discount carriers, who have successfully competed in both the United States and Europe against more established airlines, also made their mark at the air show.

Boeing on Wednesday finalized an order for 175 of its popular short-haul 737s with Irish low-cost airline Ryanair. The purchase would be valued at $15.6 billion at list prices, but Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has said he's getting a steep discount - although less than the 53 percent markdown on a prior order.

Boeing also announced orders for a total of 33 of its new generation 737-MAX 8 jets, extending the popularity of the fuel-efficient aircraft. The 737-MAX 8 planes have a list price of $100.5 million.

Aircraft leasing company CIT Aerospace, which placed an order for 30 on Wednesday, is responsible for a fleet of 350 aircraft, including 128 Boeing jets, according to the company. Travel Service, an airline based in Eastern Europe, ordered three.

Smaller jet purchases have made up the bulk of the orders this year as airlines renew their fleets or expand into new markets, notably in Asia and Latin America.

The 737 carries between 150 and 200 passengers and is Boeing's most popular model. First deliveries of the MAX are expected in 2017."

The A350 XWB, in the works for nearly a decade, is the European company's answer to Boeing's Dreamliner, an effort to push the envelope in passenger comfort, aerodynamics, and fuel efficiency.

One of the first commercial jets (after the Dreamliner) to be made primarily of composite materials instead of metal, the A350 will come in three variants — the 800, 900, and 1000. It will carry between 250 and 350 people.

Backed by seven European members of NATO: Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, the aircraft program suffered years of delays and cost €20 billion ($26.1 billion).

Now, the A400M Atlas is almost here.

Scheduled for first delivery to the French army in time for July 14 Bastille Day celebrations, the turboprop plane is designed to be capable of everything its new owners need, from midair refueling to paratrooper drop-offs to landings on short and unpaved runways.

Airbus SAS is looking to build momentum for the new A350, with its sales chief criss-crossing the globe to chase orders while test pilots and engineers race toward first flight as the Paris Air Show approaches.

With 10 days left before the industry’s premiere expo, the wide-body plane made of composite plastic has started pre-flight taxiing tests and Airbus has picked the crew of the A350s maiden flight. John Leahy, head of sales, skipped a two-day media briefing at Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, to clinch orders he can add to the 35 for the model this year alone.

The European planemaker is marketing its A350 to challenge Boeing Co.’s 787 and best-selling 777-300ER. Underscoring the neck-and-neck race in the wide-body aircraft market, where margins are higher than for smaller planes, was a $17 billion purchase by Singapore Airlines Ltd. last week which the carrier split between the two manufacturers.

“We’re ready to go,” said Pascal Verneau, the 51-year-old flight engineer who’ll sit between the two test pilots in the cockpit of the first A350 set to leave the ground. “Personally, I hope we’ll fly before the air show.”

Airbus Chief Executive Officer Fabrice Bregier told journalists yesterday that the A350, which first emerged fully painted from its hangar last month, was in good shape and would likely meet a company forecast for first flight by midyear.

Encouraging tests

“I have pilots who tell me that from the results of the simulations the quality of the aircraft is better than on in- service aircraft for previous types of the fleet,” Bregier said. “This is encouraging.”

As aerospace companies converge on Paris for the industry’s largest trade event of the year, Airbus will face Boeing as it emerges from a three-month grounding of its marquee 787 Dreamliner following battery malfunctions. Boeing plans to showcase the Dreamliner in Paris, while Airbus hasn’t committed to the A350 making an appearance.

Airbus will need a good showing with the A350 as its U.S. rival seeks pledges for a 777 successor to help halt Airbus’s advance into the wide-body market, which Boeing still dominates. Both companies also compete in the market for the largest jumbos, though Airbus hasn’t secured a firm new order so far this year for its A380 and Boeing will cut output for its 747-8 amid slack demand.

Trial series

The maiden flight of the A350 will kick off a yearlong series of trials featuring five test planes. That’s more than used for the A380 program a decade ago so the planemaker can cram more work into fewer months, A350 program director Didier Evrard said. The full flight-test program will require 2,500 hours of flight spread over the five test planes.

Relatively little is left to do before the plane can fly. After applying power on June 2 to the Trent XWB engines made by Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc, the plane taxied for the first time at low speeds this week.

A glitch in the software that controls signaling is being worked through now, after which the plane will proceed to run taxi tests at increasingly higher speeds until the so-called rejected takeoff at high velocity, to check that brakes, spoilers and thrust reversers all work properly to bring the aircraft to a controlled standstill.

Verneau, the flight-test engineer and one of six people on the maiden voyage, said he’s been working flat out and through weekends, as the suspense of first flight builds. Already a flight engineer on the A380 and A340-600 test programs, Verneau said he doesn’t anticipate any vacation until Christmas.

“This is a baby,” he said, gesturing at the A350-900 painted in Airbus corporate livery as the 219-foot (67 meter) long plane sat gleaming in the sun of southwestern France. “It’s in my hands!”

Airbus A350 XWB to make first flight Friday - CNET,"Wed, 12 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvZ2FtaW5nL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXh3Yi10by1tYWtlLWZpcnN0LWZsaWdodC1mcmlkYXkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has confirmed that the A350 XWB will make its first flight Friday, a milestone that marks perhaps the last highly touted inaugural flight for years to come.

Over the last 10 years, aviation enthusiasts have been treated to a series of exciting first flights, from Airbus' A380 to Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and 747-8 Intercontinental. But with no other game-changing airplanes set to be launched in the next five years or more, the A350's first flight could be it for a while.

There has been significant speculation in recent weeks that the plane would take flight in time to make an appearance at the aviation industry's signature event, the Paris Air Show, which begins Monday. Airbus' announcement would seem to bolster such speculation.

The A350 XWB is Airbus' answer to three of arch-rival Boeing's planes, the troubled but popular 787 Dreamliner, and the 777 and 777-X. The new plane, which should take off from Airbus' headquarters in Blagnac, France, just outside the city of Toulouse, is said to be highly fuel-efficient, thanks in large part to its use of composite materials in 53 percent of the aircraft. It also utilizes titanium and advanced aluminum alloys, meaning that more than 70 percent of the entire airframe is constructed with what Airbus calls ""advanced materials.""

The A350 XWB's fuselage is built from carbon-fiber reinforced plastic composites, which should give the plane 25 percent better fuel efficiency, and be easier to maintain. Plus, it will better resist corrosion than traditional airplane bodies. Airbus boasts that its wings, at 105 feet long by 19.7 feet wide, are the largest-ever single aviation parts made from lightweight carbon composites.

Plus, in a bid to avoid the kind of battery issues that have plagued Boeing's Dreamliner, Airbus is using nickel-cadmium batteries rather than lithium-ion.

Three models

Airbus plans on building three versions of the A350 XWB. The first is the A350-900, which directly takes on Boeing's 777-200ER, and which replaces Airbus' own A330-300. The A350-900 will seat 314 passengers in a three-class layout and is powered by game-changing Trent XWB engines generating 84,000 pounds of thrust each. The plane has a range of 8,100 nautical miles.

Next up is the A350-800 XWB, which could be a direct competitor to Boeing's forthcoming 787-9 Dreamliner, the longer follow-up to its 787-8 Dreamliner. The A350-800 XWB will replace the A330-200. It has 270 seats in a three-class configuration, and flies with Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines providing 74,000 pounds of thrust each. That plane has a range of 8,500 nautical miles.

Finally, Airbus will build the A350-1000 XWB, meant to take on the 777-300ER, and replace Airbus' own A340-600. That plane will seat 350 passengers in a three-class configuration, and uses the same engines as the A350-900. It can fly 8,400 nautical miles.

Friday's first A350 flight will be a big day for a program that was announced in 2006, and which began construction in 2009."
Airbus A350 flies over Paris Air Show - USA TODAY,"Fri, 21 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTMvMDYvMjEvYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtZmxpZXMtb3Zlci1wYXJpcy1haXItc2hvdy8yNDQ1NjA5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus A350 flies over Paris Air Show

Airbus flew its new Airbus A350 over the Paris Air Show this morning, adding an exclamation point at the end of the 50th edition of the event north of Paris at Le Bourget, France.

The fly-by was widely anticipated, but far from certain. Airbus only made its maiden flight on its new A350 just a week ago. The company clearly wanted to fly the jet over the high-profile Paris Air Show, but was unsure if would be able to pull it off so soon after the jet's maiden flight.

The A350 emerged as one of the stars of the 2013 Paris Air Show as orders for widebody jets emerged as one of the top storylines from this year's show. Airbus' A350 is the model the European jetmaker will use to compete with Boeing's new-age 787 ""Dreamliner"" and the smaller versions of Boeing's popular 777 models.

Several airlines used the Paris Air Show as platform to announce orders for the jet. Among those was United, which converted its existing order for 25 A350-900s into bigger A350-1000s and added firm orders for 10 more. That gives the airline a total order of 35 A350 jets.

As for its Paris Air Show fly-by, FlightGlobal.com reports that the A350 ""made a single pass at about (1:25 p.m. local time/7:25 a.m. ET) along Le Bourget's runway 21 at a height of 600 (feet) before executing a climbing right turn and heading south-west.""

The A350 performed the pass as part of a test flight that saw it depart Airbus' manufacturing base near Toulouse at 10:50 a.m. local time, according to FlightGlobal.com."

Scandinavian airline SAS announced Tuesday it plans to order 12 new Airbus aircraft. The deal would be worth $3.3 billion at list prices, though airlines typically negotiate significant discounts with big jetmakers Airbus and Boeing.

SAS signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) — short of a firm order — for eight A350-900 and four A330-300 planes as part of a renewal of its long-haul fleet.

The deal also includes upgrades of seven older A330 and A340 widebodies and an option to purchase another six A350 aircraft.

SAS said the A330s will be delivered in 2015 and the A350s in 2018.

Despite the MOU, as opposed to a firm order, SAS sent out an e-mail to its frequent-fliers touting the new jets.

""This will make our long-haul fleet top of class in the industry!"" SAS says in the e-mail, adding the new jets will offer ""completely horizontal flatbed seats in SAS Business, a new high-definition full video on demand entertainment system in the entire cabin (and) quieter planes.""

SAS also touts the order on its website, saying ""the Airbus A350-900 XWB has approximately 20% higher passenger capacity than the existing A340/A330 fleet. The A350 is a completely new aircraft type incorporating advanced aerodynamics and the latest materials and system technology available.""

First flight of Airbus A350 reopens wide-body race - ABC NEWS 4,"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3czQuY29tL2FyY2hpdmUvZmlyc3QtZmxpZ2h0LW9mLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXJlb3BlbnMtd2lkZS1ib2R5LXJhY2XSAVNodHRwczovL2FiY25ld3M0LmNvbS9hbXAvYXJjaGl2ZS9maXJzdC1mbGlnaHQtb2YtYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtcmVvcGVucy13aWRlLWJvZHktcmFjZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS (AP) - Airbus sent a new wide-body plane into the skies Friday that sets the stage for intensifying competition with U.S. rival Boeing - with consequences for jobs, airlines' investments and the reputations of the powerful planemakers.

After years of delays and a revamp that cost billions, the A350 cruised for four hours in partly cloudy skies above Toulouse in southern France.

Most importantly, it then landed safely.

It met ear-to-ear smiles - and some sighs of relief - among the Airbus engineers and executives who helped the plane reach its maiden journey.

The flight marks a key step on the path to full certification for the jet, which can carry between 250 and 400 passengers and is the European aircraft-maker's best hope for catching up in a long-haul market dominated by Boeing's 777 and the 787, known as the Dreamliner.

""At the end of the day you need to make it real, and this is the time for making it real. So I am very proud already,"" Didier Evrard, head of the A350 program, said while watching the flight.

""But I will be still nervous until it comes back.""

Airspace over Toulouse, where Airbus has its headquarters, closed for both take-off and landing. With distinctive, upturned wing tips, the plane had a great big ""A350"" painted across its belly, heightening anticipation that it will fly at the Paris Air Show next week.

The plane's undercarriage remained down for the first part of the flight, so that they could run through a series of checks and ensure it was ready for the full flight.

Airbus has 613 orders for the A350, and hopes Friday's flight will bring it momentum heading into next week's Paris Air Show, which is already shaping up as a battle of the wide-body planes.

""There is a lot of money at stake, a lot of employment at stake. This is an extremely important political, social and economic issue,"" said Gerald Feldzer, a French aviation expert and former airline pilot.

Airbus' potential customers, the world's airlines, have all been squeezed by high aviation fuel costs and a fall in passengers because of the struggling world economy. Carriers are therefore looking for ways to run their fleets more cost-effectively.

More than half of the twin-engine A350 consists of lightweight carbon-fiber designed to save on jet fuel, which makes up half the cost of long-haul flights.

Airbus claims the A350 is 25 percent more fuel-efficient than comparable planes.

The A350, which was delayed for two years as Airbus hashed out a new design, is a competitor to the 787 - minus the lithium ion batteries now under investigation for unexplained smoldering. Airbus abandoned its plans to use the lithium ion batteries despite their advantages in weight, power and re-charging speed.

""The A350 has the same innovations more or less as the Dreamliner, the 787,"" said Feldzer. ""The same amount or proportion of carbon for the lightness of the material, just as many electrical devices.""

Boeing's list prices for its 787 line range from $206 million to $243 million. Airbus lists prices ranging from $254 million to $332 million, and had 613 orders as of May, compared with 890 orders for the 787. Steep discounts are common on large orders, although the details are rarely made public.

The initial A350 program was scrapped and redesigned after customers criticized it. Development of the plane was held up by management disputes and financial troubles at Airbus early on.

But Boeing faced its own delays and problems with the 787, and analysts say Airbus is now trying to position itself as the airplane manufacturer that can get the job done.

""Boeing has the broader product line but they are still struggling under the shadows of the 787 nightmare and they seem unenthusiastic about launching new products,"" said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with the Teal Group. ""Airbus has its chance to show themselves as the opposite of that.""

It was nearly two years after Boeing's first flight of the 787 until the first passengers stepped onboard the jet. Aboulafia expects a similar timeframe for the A350.

However, he notes about Airbus: ""So far they have surprised, positively.""

Airbus hopes the timeframe is shorter. It's aiming to deliver the first A350 to Qatar Airways in the second half of next year.

The Toulouse-based company said the plane that flew on Friday will get a detailed inspection that will take two or three days before the plane flies for a second time. After that, it expects flight testing to take a little more than a year, Airbus President and CEO Fabrice Bregier said in a video released by the company. About 2,500 hours of flight testing are planned.

Eric Bernardini, a managing director at AlixPartners and aerospace analyst, said, Airbus designers ""have matured a lot in their development process,"" said Bernardini. The Airbus CEO ""was always insisting on simplicity and not overcomplicating the design and having a monster that is difficult to manufacture.""

The A350 will compete against larger versions of Boeing's new 787, but is also aimed at Boeing's 777-300ER, which has been a runaway hit with airlines. The original 777 design is aging - it first flew in 1994. Airbus said that eight out of 10 customers for the 777-300 ER have ordered A350s. U.S. customers for the A350 include United Continental Holdings Inc. and Hawaiian Airlines.

The biggest A350 will carry roughly 350 passengers, slightly fewer than a 777-300ER. Planes like that are generally used on long-haul international flights. Those planes have turned out to be popular with airlines who want large aircraft - but not superjumbos like the Airbus A380 or Boeing's new 747-8i. Sales of those two giants have been disappointing.

Boeing is considering whether to build a new version of its 777, now called the 777X, which would boost fuel efficiency with new carbon-fiber wings and new engines. Boeing is widely expected to announce a final decision about building the 777 at next week's Paris Air Show.

A year ago, at the Paris Air Show's sister event in Britain, Boeing beat Airbus for the number of orders announced. The two companies vie closely each year for the title of world's biggest plane maker, and the race is as tight as ever."
Boeing goes head to head with Airbus after Dreamliner woes - The Guardian,"Sat, 22 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEzL2p1bi8yMy9haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLWJhdHRsZS1tYXN0ZXJ5LXNraWVz0gFTaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMTMvanVuLzIzL2FpcmJ1cy1ib2VpbmctYmF0dGxlLW1hc3Rlcnktc2tpZXM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When British Airways takes delivery of its first 787 Dreamliner at Heathrow this week, it will mark another step in the rehabilitation of Boeing's reputation, and a minor victory in one of the world's great corporate battles.

For Boeing, this is a further opportunity to restore the reputation and fortunes of a carbon fibre miracle that briefly took on the air of an industrial disaster when burning batteries grounded the fleet in early 2013. Its gestation has been public and painful: after endless delays in production, the hype over its maiden voyages gave way to safety concerns that grew until aviation regulators took the fleet out of service.

The 787 did not return to the skies, with modified batteries, until late April. But airlines haven't lost their lust for a wide-bodied plane with the fuel efficiency and range of a much larger model – and one that also promises more peace for passengers and bystanders. As British airports push to expand, noise levels may prove particularly relevant and backers of Heathrow's expansion will welcome a quieter presence over west London.

Boeing's arch-rival, Airbus, has not revelled in its competitor's discomfort. Before the Dreamliner saga, the Franco-German business was in the headlines for persistent delays in producing its A380 superjumbo, which then endured high-profile mishaps once it entered service. The discovery of cracks in the wings of the A380 fleet – in the wake of an engine blowout on a passenger flight in 2010 – undermined the allure of a plane that represented the cutting edge of commercial aviation before the Dreamliner came along.

With perfect timing, Airbus has unveiled its response to the Dreamliner's return – the A350. The first of these slightly smaller jets took off from Toulouse on 14 June, in time for a swoop over the Paris Airshow last week. The Airbus plane is less revolutionary than the 787. It has similarly efficient engines and enough carbon-fibre to bring down the weight and the fuel bill, but not the battery-driven auxiliary systems that have plagued Boeing. For an airline industry wary of taking chances as profits tumble, it is a conservative compromise.

At Paris Airbus sold 69 more A350s, mainly to established customers such as Singapore Airlines, along with a good batch for Air France, naturellement. But Boeing secured ""commitments"" for 102 Dreamliners at Paris as it finally revealed plans for the 787-10 – a stretched model with around 330 seats that will match the capacity of the smaller A350s, entering service in 2018.

Randy Tinseth, Boeing's vice-president of marketing, says the battery problems had delayed the go-ahead despite interest from customers. But he adds: ""There is a little bit of magic in that aircraft because of the experience it gives passengers ... The more the airplane is out there in the air, the better it will do in the market because people just love it.""

The crucial people who ""love it"" are airlines who see a way into new long-haul markets on a lighter, fuel-efficient plane. Airports, meanwhile, think it can change the way planners view the economics of certain routes. In Britain this adds to the debate on whether, and where, to expand London's crowded airports. Gatwick trumpeted the merits of the ""hub-busting"" Dreamliner that Thomson Airways will operate from the airport, claiming its arrival meant that the decades ahead would shift airlines away from the ""hub and spokes"" model – where passengers fly in on short-haul planes then transfer to a long-haul flight. That is the business plan for the UK's biggest airport, Heathrow. But the Dreamliner gives the likes of Gatwick a chance to offer economically competitive long-haul services with just one runway.

For Heathrow, even more significant is the arrival of BA's first A380 on 4 July. A hole has already been carved in the entrance to the BA hangar, to allow the tailfin of the giant plane to squeeze through. This is the plane of Heathrow's future – doubly so if expansion plans are thwarted. With passengers connecting at the hub, it can load ever greater numbers on a single take-off. Where demand is high, such as on transatlantic routes, the numbers can make sense for airline and airport alike – and potentially for Londoners under the flight path, with the A380 promising to be far quieter than the Boeing 747.

With Boeing's own superjumbo heading for extinction because of the advent of the A380, it's perhaps unsurprising that Tinseth is sniffy about the A380 and its prospects for solving airport capacity issues. ""I could take every passenger on a wide-body today, put them on an A380, and that's not going to address the issue,"" he says. ""The way we see the market still headed is more fragmentation ... more flights to more places, rather than bigger and bigger airplanes. That really provides benefit to the passenger because it dramatically reduces their flight times.""

Airbus, and plenty of aviation analysts, remain confident about the future of the A380, but it is heavily reliant on one customer. Emirates has ordered 90 A380s and transformed its Dubai airport home to accommodate a plane whose economics match the strategy of the airline and its host hub airport. Only 20 A380s were sold at Paris, to a leasing company, Doric.

While the battle lines are being drawn, many airlines are happy to pitch their tents in the middle. BA and Singapore Airlines have announced carefully balanced orders from both manufacturers in recent months.

Douglas McNeill, investment director at stockbroker Charles Stanley, says that when planning future fleets, ""you're never quite sure what would suit you best"". The bottom line is the cost and revenue generated per seat per kilometre. ""Those might sound like quite simple questions but they're not: the number of people on the plane influences the weight, then the fuel ... Frequency and speed might mean you can raise fares. So airlines are reluctant to commit – they're hedging their bets. It also lets you drive a hard bargain.""

This negotiating tactic was claimed by easyJet to bring in its own Paris deal although low-cost carriers generally prefer to run as few aircraft types as possible to minimise crew training and maintenance costs. McNeill says that, to make the sums add up, Boeing would have had to go some distance to undercut Airbus, whose planes are the only ones easyJet now flies.

With such deals potentially valued at tens of billions of dollars, the finely balanced corporate battle has a wider impact: prime minister David Cameron was quick to tweet congratulations to Airbus for the A350 take-off ""securing 6,200 UK jobs"" – reflecting the fact that all Airbus wings are made in the UK.

Meanwhile, as befits two heavyweights, there was, before Paris, an edge detectable in Tinseth's voice as he talked of the ""strong rivalry"" and accused Airbus of holding back orders for the show. By the time of the show he had upped the rhetoric to claim that Boeing was outmanoeuvring Airbus: ""We've got them boxed and bracketed.""

John Leahy, chief operating officer for Airbus, retorted: ""Our A350 XWB has been outselling the 787 by better than two to one over the past five years. In addition our [short- haul] A320neo family retains a 60% market share lead. That's a corner I want to stay boxed into.""

And the final score in this Paris match? Airbus pipped Boeing with deals worth $68.7bn, for 466 passenger jets. Boeing notched $66.4bn for 442 planes. The running total for 2013, meanwhile, has Airbus ahead by 734 planes to 692. The battle continues."

CNN —

Airbus has confirmed that the first flight of its long-awaited A350 XWB is set for the morning of June 14, 2013, weather permitting.

According to the European aircraft maker, the “MSN1” flight-test aircraft will take off from Toulouse-Blagnac airport at around 10 a.m. local time (8 a.m. GMT).

Airbus has set up a website, www.a350xwbfirstflight.com, for those who want to watch the A350’s inaugural flight live online.

Today’s launch is in line with speculation among aviation professionals that Airbus is planning to show off its new plane at the upcoming Paris Air Show, a rumor the company has yet to confirm.

The A350 XWB is the first in a family of super-efficient passenger planes Airbus designed to go head-to-head with rival Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner and 777s.

“XWB” means “extra wide body.” There are three members in the A350 family: the A350-800, the A350-900 and the A350-1000, which seat 270, 314 and 350 passengers respectively, in three-class seating.

The plane was unveiled last month at Airbus HQ in Toulouse, France. Today’s flight is the latest milestone in what has been a turbulent production history for the A350 program, which was first announced in 2006."

The A350, which has been in the making since 2004, is Airbus' first commercial jet to be made primarily from composite materials, offering better fuel efficiency and the latest in passenger comfort.

The plane will help it compete with Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner, also made largely from light-weight composite materials.

Airbus has proceeded cautiously after the Dreamliner, which was launched in September 2011, faced several battery malfunctions earlier this year. That led regulators to ground the plane for several months until Boeing could fix the problem.

Last week, Airbus' chief operating officer John Leahy told Aviation Week the plane-maker was not going to rush the first flight of the A350: ""We are not going to fall victim like Boeing did with the 787.""

All Eyes on Airbus as It Prepares for First Flight of Composite Airliner - WIRED,"Fri, 07 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS8yMDEzLzA2L3Rlc3QtcGlsb3RzLWRpc2N1c3MtYTM1MC1maXJzdC1mbGlnaHQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Now that the Airbus A350-XWB has moved under its own power, albeit at a walking pace, there is mounting anticipation to see the composite airliner make its inaugural flight.

The European aviation giant is keeping mum on when the A350 might take to the air for the first time, but the Paris Air Show begins in little more than a week. That's got everyone in the aerospace industry wondering if the A350-XWB will make an appearance above one of the biggest stages in aviation. The company's chief rival, Boeing, will be performing at the airshow with the composite 787 Dreamliner, so it's hard to see Airbus letting Boeing take the limelight at the industry's most important event.

The new A350-XWB was recently hauled out of the paint hangar and this week fired up its engines and started the first stages of testing with some slow taxiing near the factory. More slow taxi tests were completed today, and higher speed tests are expected in coming days. Many expect an inaugural flight shortly thereafter. Further teasing aviation buffs, the company trotted out the six members of its flight test team to explain what will happen when the A350-XWB takes off.

""We are at a high level of readiness and quality,"" Didier Evrard, who leads the A350 program, told reporters gathered in Toulouse, France. ""We have reached a level of maturity that is comparable to entry into service in past programs.""

The test pilots said the prototype A350-XWB, MSN001, will be loaded and flown at the ""middle of the envelope"" with regard to weight, speed and other parameters. Flying under conservative flight conditions is typical for a first flight.

During take off, the airplane's flight computers will be turned off, with controls operating in the ""direct law"" mode. Because the A350-XWB is, like the 787 Dreamliner, a fly-by-wire aircraft, a computer is always involved in transmitting control stick forces to the control surfaces. But Airbus uses several different ""laws"" that engage different computers and software to provide varying levels of assistance or automation during flight. In ""direct law"" mode there is no ""buffer"" between the pilot and the control services, meaning the computer will do exactly what the pilot commands.

The crew expects to climb to around 10,000 feet and about 200 knots (230 mph), at which point it will change the flap configuration and raise the landing gear. These changes are usually made immediately after take off in a normal flight, but during a first flight, the goal is usually not to change anything in the first few minutes until the pilots are confident in the basic flying qualities.

Once the gear is up, the pilots will engage the normal flight-control law, meaning the flight computers will have more input between the pilot and the control surfaces. They will also increase the speeds and altitude. Airbus says the team could fly as high as 43,000 feet and go as fast as Mach 0.89 (about 587 mph), which is expected to be the maximum speed of the jet. All six crew members will wear parachutes, which is normal during a first flight. The center section of the forward cargo door - marked in red in the picture above - can be jettisoned to provide an escape hatch.

While it is assumed the first flight will likely happen before the Paris Air Show begins on June 17, it is still not known whether or not Airbus will make a fly-by for those gathered at the Le Bourget airport where Charles Lindbergh touched down in 1927. The flight test team says everything will have to go smoothly on the first flight, and even then the authorities would have to grant permission for the test aircraft to fly over the show."

We stepped inside to see what the European plane maker came up with, and it's impressive.

Airbus made the controls for the A350 similar to those for its A380, A320, and A350/A340, so pilots who change from one to another can skip the lengthy training course.

More Good Stuff on the Airbus A350 XWB First Flight - Airline Reporter,"Tue, 18 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMy8wNi9tb3JlLWdvb2Qtc3R1ZmYtb24tdGhlLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXh3Yi1maXJzdC1mbGlnaHQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An excerpt from Chris Sloan’s story on Airchive.com:

The first half of 2013 and has certainly been a busy year in the annals of commercial aviation. In January the worldwide fleet of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner was grounded; not taking to the skies again until May. On Valentine’s Day, American Airlines and USAirways announced a blockbuster merger creating the world’s largest airline and effectively ending the legacy airlines consolidation game in the United States. In early March, Bombardier rolled-out the CSeries CS100, the first in a line of airliners that could not only be a game changing regional jet, but possibly challenge the Airbus A320 / Boeing 737 duopoly.

These headlines alone would make any year exceptional, but only midway through the year another major event loomed large. On June 14th Airbus embarked on flying for the first time what’s likely the last ’œtotally clean sheet’ large airliner for the rest of this decade ’“ the A350 XWB. Even with roughly 2 days notice, there was absolutely no way I was going to miss this historic event. I, along with many had suspected June 13th or 14th would be ’œD-Day’ for the A350 so I had my bags packed and reservations on hold just in case.

As we would learn later, Airbus had this week as a target for the last 9 months. Much has been already written about the A350 over the last 7 years and its maiden flight, I want this piece to take you with me on what it was like moment by moment to be there and witness aviation history. First, let’s go back to the future for a little A350 XWB refresher.

Flying Business Class on Fiji Airways New Airbus A330 - Airline Reporter,"Mon, 03 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMy8wNi9mbHlpbmctYnVzaW5lc3MtY2xhc3Mtb24tZmlqaS1haXJ3YXlzLW5ldy1haXJidXMtYTMzMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The tiny Pacific island of Fiji has a national airline just as tiny. Air Pacific, however, dreams big and their dream just came true. In just a few short days, the Air Pacific name will be retired, ushering in the era of Fiji Airways, and more importantly, a new fleet.

After a time of financial difficulty, Air Pacific has rebounded to profitability, and decided it was time to replace their aging 747-400 long-haul fleet. Initially ordering and later cancelling a fleet of eight Boeing 787s, Air Pacific ordered three Airbus A330-200s in late 2011, the second of which was delivered last week. These airplanes represent everything that is new about the tiny airline, inside and out.

Let’s Start With The Outside

The first impression any passenger has with an aircraft occurs before they ever step foot inside. Upon laying eyes on the airline’s new Airbus A330, passengers will immediately know that things have changed. The old, worn, Air Pacific livery is gone as a part of a larger re-branding effort.

The airline payed considerable attention to their new livery and design, and it really shines through. Other airlines might spend years and millions of dollars for an external firm to design and create a new symbol and livery. Fiji Airways, however, didn’t go that route.

The airline’s new livery, which is arguably one of the nicest out there at the moment, was designed by a native Fiji artist. The artist is a wonderful woman named Makareta Matemosi, from the Fiji island of ‘Namuka-i-Lau, which just happens to be the name of the 2nd A330. Makareta designed three specific “Masi motifs” that represent the airline and Fiji.

BONUS: Watch Fiji Airway’s A330 landing at LAX

The first Masi, referred to as a Teteva symbol, is at the center of the tail, and “represents the friendliness of the Fijians and their deep caring nature.” (Yes, the Fijians are extremely friendly.) The second Masi motif, called the Rova, is ringed around the two engines, and “symbolizes the warm greeting Fijians extend to visitors.” The last Masi, the Makare, which surrounds the Teteva, “evokes the allure of clear water and white sandy beaches.”

Not every airline livery is able to capture the attention of passengers, while looking good doing it. Fiji Airways hit the combination just right. It’s beautiful.

It’s What’s On Inside That Counts

Past passengers of Air Pacific who have flown on their Boeing 747 didn’t have much to get excited about. The airframes were acquired from other airlines after they were deemed to be too outdated and not much updating was ever done. It’s like flying in 1989, but in 2013, which might excite some #AvGeeks, but most passengers won’t share that excitement. The new Fiji Airways A330, however, is a whole new ballgame. Bright, lush, roomy, and high tech is how you can explain the new aircraft.

These aircraft are packed with everything one might expect out of a new airliner in 2013. In economy class, there are 249 seats in a 2-4-2 configuration. The seats generally have a 32″ pitch (though some seats have 31″) with a total of 7.5″ recline, including 1.5″ of bottom articulation. The seats are actually quite comfy, with enough legroom to keep most taller passengers happy for a long haul flight.

The aircraft is fitted with new technology from front to back. The old 747 did provide personal IFE, but only to the extent of 12 channels of looping video, which really showed its age. The A330 sports the incredible Panasonic eX2 entertainment system, with 10.6″ LCD screens throughout economy. The eX2 system, which is top of the line, provides a massive database of movies, television shows, games, and music. Yea, that’s a big upgrade.

Power hungry passengers can breath easy, as Fiji Airways has you covered. All seats have a dedicated USB port, which every other seat has access to an EmPower power, which is able to provide power to laptops. Most U.S. based airlines don’t even provide this kind of support for personal electronics.

The entire cabin is also bathed in LED lighting, allowing for mood settings such as sunrise and sunset. This may not sound like a big deal, but when waking up passengers after a long overnight flight, turning the florescent lights from “off” to “super death kill bright” is harsh. The sunrise mode gently brings up the LED lights over a period of time, to gently wake up passengers. It doesn’t sound like a big feature, but anything helps on a 10 hour overnight flight.

Biggest Changes Are Up Front

Throughout the entire aircraft, the biggest changes from the 747 to the A330 can be found up front in Business Class, or “Tabua” Class. The 747 featured 28 old school recliner seats, while the A330 has 24 “lie flat” seats. While the recliners on the 747 only had one trick, reclining, the A330 seats are feature packed.

The seats are configured on a 2-2-2 layout, so each seat is either an aisle or a window seat. With the new layout comes greater privacy, which passengers love on overnight flights. While the seats have 60″ pitch, they are not completely lie flat. Instead, they stop just short at about 8 degrees. While the new seats are light years more comfortable and adjustable than the old reclines, some may still find it difficult to fall asleep at an angle.

Technology wise, Business Class is just as feature packed at Economy. The Panasonic eX2 system screens get bumped up to 15.4 inches, and must be controlled via the tethered remote. The system up front is not touch screen, and some controls may be a bit awkward, but you should get the hang of it in no time. Every Business Class seat has its own USB and EmPower port as well. While a majority of passengers have access to power for laptops, sadly, there is no internet connectivity, nor should passengers expect it anytime soon.

One feature that Fiji Airways seems to be lacking in Business Class is the distribution of noise cancelling headphones. All passengers receive the same type of headphones, which are really not very good. Even with the volume cranked up all the way, it might not be enough for those with sensitive ears. The headphone jack throughout the aircraft is the three prong type, so unless you have an adapter or headphones that are compatible, you are out of luck.

The seats also feature several stowage areas under the entertainment screen, as well as a few bottle holders. Every passenger should, of course, find a bottle of Fiji Water in the bottle holder. What else would you expect, really?

Little Airline, Big Product

The product on this rather modestly sized airline is anything but modest. The design is bold, the interior is fresh, and the product is world class. The people of Fiji are proud of their national airline, and they have every right to be. Any passenger who boards these new A330s is going to feel the warmth and kindness that Fijians so proudly display. In a future AirlineReporter.com post, we will take you inside Fiji, and our wild ride on the delivery flight to Fiji!

Comparing the 737 and the A320: the story continues - Leeham News and Analysis,"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMy8wNi8xNC9jb21wYXJpbmctdGhlLTczNy1hbmQtdGhlLWEzMjAtdGhlLXN0b3J5LWNvbnRpbnVlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The war of words between Airbus and Boeing continues over the A320 and the 737, with each company boasting its airplanes are better than the competitors.

The competing positions were evident in the pre-Paris Air Show briefings from both companies. The comparisons between the single aisle airplanes were front-and-center again.

We’ve written on several occasions that when Boeing compares the 737 with the Airbus A320, officials credit the 737 with Performance Improvement Packages (PIPs) but except for the sharklets and the neo, does not credit Airbus with any other improvements while listing years of upgrades for the 737.

We’ve been critical of the practice, which continues. We recognize that Airbus and Boeing will put their product in the best light, and Airbus selectively chooses information to promote its airplanes at the expense of Boeing (the A330-300 v the 787-9 being a particularly egregious example we’ve written about in the past.)

We’ve written many pieces that airlines tell us the 737-800 and A320 are within 2% of each other on cash operating costs, favoring the 738.

In the most recent briefings, Boeing displayed the following charts comparing the 737 vs the A320.

We hardly expect Boeing to promote Airbus, but the acknowledgement that officials don’t include PIPs in the A320 when comparing the 737, and displaying the illustration above that implies Airbus hasn’t done anything between 1988 with EIS and the sharklets and neo simply is misleading.

Boeing also displayed this chart.

We asked Airbus what PIPs and upgrades it has undertaken since the A320’s EIS and got these charts in response.

Airbus rival to Boeing's Dreamliner passes first test - The Guardian,"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEzL2p1bi8xNC9haXJidXMtcml2YWwtYm9laW5nLWRlYW1saW5lci10ZXN00gFTaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMTMvanVuLzE0L2FpcmJ1cy1yaXZhbC1ib2VpbmctZGVhbWxpbmVyLXRlc3Q?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A350's maiden flight ended with a safe landing on Friday, setting the stage for intensifying competition with US rival Boeing in the long-haul wide-body aircraft market.

The four-hour flight marks a key step on the path to full certification for the jet, which can carry between 250 and 400 passengers and is the European aircraft maker's best hope for catching up in a long-haul market dominated by Boeing's 787 and 777.

Airspace at the airport in the southern French city of Toulouse, where Airbus has its headquarters, closed for both take-off and landing.

Airbus has 613 orders for the A350, and hopes Friday's flight will bring it momentum heading into next week's Paris air show, which is already shaping up as a battle of the wide-body planes.

More than half of the twin-engine jet consists of lightweight carbon-fibre designed to save on fuel, which makes up half the cost of long-haul flights.

The A350, which was delayed for two years as Airbus hashed out the new design, is a direct competitor with the 787 Dreamliner – minus the lithium ion batteries now under investigation for unexplained smoldering. Airbus abandoned its plans to use the lithium ion batteries despite their advantages in weight, power and re-charging speed.

""The A350 has the same innovations more or less as the Dreamliner, the 787,"" said Gerard Feldzer, a French aviation expert and former airline pilot.

""It is pretty much equivalent, the same amount or proportion of carbon for the lightness of the material, just as many electrical devices.""

Boeing's list prices for its 787 line range from $206 million to $243 million. Airbus lists prices ranging from $254 million to $332m (£211m), and had 613 orders as of May, compared with 890 orders for the 787. Steep discounts are common on large orders, although the details are rarely made public.

Airbus claims the A350 burns 25% less fuel than the Boeing due to its lighter weight, redesigned Rolls Royce engines and new aerodynamics.

""The first flight is a very special moment in an aerospace company,"" Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus parent company EADS, said"
Airbus A350 XWB takes to the air for the first time - New Atlas,"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXh3Yi1tYWlkZW4tZmxpZ2h0LzI3OTQ1L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Seven years after plans for the Airbus A350 XWB (extra wide body) were first revealed at the Farnborough Air Show in 2006, the aircraft took to the air for the first time on June 14. The maiden flight saw the aircraft in the skies of southwestern France for four hours and five minutes before returning to Toulouse-Blagnac Airport.

The Airbus A350 XWB is a family of two-engined, long-range jet airliners that will range in size from the 60.5 m (198 ft) long A350-800, which can carry 270 passengers, up to the 73.5 m (241 ft) long A350-1000, which can carry up to 350 passengers.

The prototype aircraft that flew on June 14 was an A350-900 variant that sits in between the 800 and 1000 variants. It measures 66.8 m (219 ft) long and seats up to 314 passengers in a typical three-class cabin nine-abreast layout. However, only a crew of six was on board for the maiden flight. All variants feature a fuselage that measures 5.9 m (20 ft) wide and 6 m (20 ft) high.

All three variants are powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines, which Rolls-Royce calls “the most efficient flying in the world today.” Airbus says the A350 XWB family uses 25 percent less fuel and emits 25 percent less CO2 than other existing aircraft in the same size category.

The test flight saw the crew explore the aircraft’s flight envelope in the skies of southwestern France, accompanied by a chase plane that observed and filmed the various maneuvers. Experts on the ground also monitored the flight via a direct telemetry link.

The four-hour flight marks the beginning of the A350 XWB test flight campaign that will see five A350s racking up around 2,500 flight hours on its way to the aircraft’s certification before entering service with Qatar Airways in the second half of 2014.

Honeywell and Safran demonstrate electric green taxiing system on Airbus A320 - Military & Aerospace Electronics,"Sun, 16 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWxpdGFyeWFlcm9zcGFjZS5jb20vY29tbWVyY2lhbC1hZXJvc3BhY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS8xNDIyNzA0MS9ob25leXdlbGwtYW5kLXNhZnJhbi1kZW1vbnN0cmF0ZS1lbGVjdHJpYy1ncmVlbi10YXhpaW5nLXN5c3RlbS1vbi1haXJidXMtYTMyMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, 17 June 2013. Honeywell (NYSE:HON) and Safran (NYSE Euronext Paris:SAF), having completed the first major phase of testing of their electric green taxiing system (EGTS), are publicly demonstrating the technology for the first time, installed on an Airbus A320 aircraft, at the 50th International Paris Air Show held at Le Bourget Airport.

Developed by EGTS International, a joint venture between Honeywell and Safran launched in 2011, the technology enables aircraft to taxi autonomously using its own electrical power, avoiding the use of the main engines during taxiing. EGTS is designed to improve airline operating efficiency during taxi operations and cut fuel consumption by up to four percent per flight cycle.

EGTS will also reduce noise and carbon and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions during taxi operations, as well as reduce gate and tarmac congestion, improve on-time departure, and allow passengers to deplane faster as a result of smoother ground handling operations, says a representative. Officials anticipate introducing EGTS to the market in 2016.

EGTS enables aircraft to push back autonomously and taxi between gate and runway without engaging the main engines by using the auxiliary power unit (APU) generator to power electric motors in the main landing gear. Each of an EGTS-equipped aircraft's powered wheels is fitted with a control system, giving pilots total control of the aircraft's speed and direction during taxi operations. In addition to reduced fuel burn, the system will reduce engine and brake wear and minimize the risk of damage to engine turbines from foreign objects on the tarmac.

The component system and aircraft testing program has accumulated more than 3,000 hours of testing on seven bespoke testing benches and rigs, including on-ground maneuvers in Toulouse, France, on an A320 modified by the joint venture for the EGTS development program.

Since this aircraft's ""first move"" in April of this year, the EGTS fitted to it has logged close to 160 kilometers (100 miles) of rolling tests. These tests evaluate the system in various load configurations and runway conditions, through a series of complex maneuvers such as pushback, tight turns and U-turns, according to varying specifications of acceleration and speed. The next major milestone of the testing program following the Paris Air Show will be to conduct these same maneuvers at speeds up to 20 knots, at full performance and with the aircraft at maximum take-off weight (MTOW).

""EGTS is a revolutionary system that brings immediate benefits for a pilot operating in congested airports. In addition to faster push-back times, being fully autonomous with its reverse mode, the system is very smooth and so easy to operate, enabling the plane to accelerate without any delay, and move at a steady rate,” says Jens Berlinson, test pilot, Safran. “With EGTS we no longer need to use the brakes unlike with today's aircraft that have a tendency to accelerate naturally even when the engines are at idle. This is especially valuable in busy airports, where planes are often queuing up for an extended period of time before take-off."""
Airbus and Boeing wide-body planes dominate Paris Air Show - RFI English,"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJmaS5mci9lbi92aXNpdGluZy1mcmFuY2UvMjAxMzA2MTctYWlyYnVzLWFuZC1ib2Vpbmctd2lkZS1ib2R5LXBsYW5lcy1kb21pbmF0ZS1wYXJpcy1haXItc2hvd9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"France

The US aircraft-leasing group ILFC has ordered 50 more Airbus A320neo airliners, the two companies announced on the first day of the Paris Air Show on Monday.

The catalogue price for the sale is 3.7 billion euros. In 2011, ILFC had ordered 100 of the A320neo aircraft, which are more fuel-efficient than the A320 series, widely used by low-cost airlines and on short-haul routes.

The world's biggest air show took to the air on Monday at Le Bourget, just outside the French capital.

A battle between Boeing and Airbus for orders in the lucrative market for wide-body planes is set to dominate the event.

Airbus is pinning its hopes on the fuel-efficient A350 to compete in the long-haul sector after gradually winning more than half of the market for medium-haul, single-aisle planes that carry an average of 150 passengers.

The A350 is expected to conduct a fly-by of the air show towards the end of the week, hoping to woo potential customers.

Boeing is also entering the show in upbeat mood as it seeks to move on from its difficulties with the trouble-prone 787 Dreamliner.

Technical problems with overheating batteries forced the worldwide grounding of the Dreamliner fleet in a major setback for the Seattle-based manufacturer.

At Le Bourget, Boeing is expected to announce the launch of its 787-10X, a longer version of the original Dreamliner, which can accommodate up to 330 passengers.

The US firm is also set to announce in the coming months an up-to-date version of its existing 777, with wings made of fuel-saving composite material like the Dreamliner.

Boeing boss Ray Conner said it was going to be a ""great competition"" and said that airlines would ""benefit from the fact that both companies are going to have a good wide-body product line.""

Airbus has positioned the A350 for the market between the popular 777 and the 787, hoping to steal share away from both planes.

The European firm argues that its craft will consume six percent less fuel than the 787 and a quarter less than the 777.

Boeing's strategy, on the other hand, is to offer its clients a wider choice of long-haul airliners.

At last year's Farnborough show in Britain, which alternates with Le Bourget, Boeing came out on top, securing orders worth more than double the sum secured by Airbus.

However, while the big two still dominate the shows, other players are entering the market, with Canada's Bombardier hoping to win orders in the medium-haul segment with its CSeries, a plane with 110 to 130 seats.

""The duopoly is definitely over,"" acknowledged Randy Tinseth, marketing vice-president at Boeing.

But the Paris air show, in its 50th edition this year, is not just about commercial battles and the long-awaited A400M military transport plane will also probably prove a highlight as it takes to the skies.

The market in unmanned surveillance drones will also be in focus after three top European defence companies urged the creation of a European programme to manufacture the craft, currently available only from Israel or the United States.

The Paris Air Show runs from June 17 to 23. It is expected to welcome some 350,000 visitors through its cavernous show halls.

The event, which has become the global aviation industry's largest in terms of surface and number of exhibitors, will throw open its doors to the public on June 21 after first welcoming professionals.

Airbus Successfully Completes First A350 Flight - NYCAviation,"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55Y2F2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDEzLzA2L2FpcmJ1cy1jb25kdWN0cy1maXJzdC1hMzUwLWZsaWdodC8yOTAxMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In the early morning hours of Friday, Airbus A350 “MSN1” climbed into the skies over Toulouse for the very first time. The first flight, just days before the 50th Paris Air Show, is a huge milestone in the A350 program, which is the latest widebody aircraft in the Airbus family.

Much like the Boeing 787, the Airbus A350 has ditched traditional materials, and instead is produced with a combination of composite materials, with titanium and advanced aluminum alloys, as well as a carbon fibre reinforced plastic fuselage. Airbus is claiming a 25% boost in fuel efficiency compared to its competitors, thanks in part to its two new Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines.

The A350 program has been relatively low key in the media. After the 787 battery malfunctions, Airbus decided to swap out the lithium ion batteries in the A350, instead option for traditional nickel cadmium batteries for entry into service. However, this does not rule out the possibility of switching to lithium ion in the future.

“This first flight marks the beginning of a test campaign totaling around 2,500 flight hours with a fleet of five development aircraft. The rigorous flight testing will lead to the certification of the A350-900 variant by the European EASA and US FAA airworthiness authorities, prior to entry into service in the second half of 2014 with first operator Qatar Airways,” said Airbus via press release.

There are currently 613 orders for the A350, though that number is likely to change during the Paris Air Show. In the United States, US Airways has 22 ordered (18 for the A350-800, and 4 for the larger A350-900), United has ordered 25 A350-900’s, and Hawaiian has ordered 6 of the 800 variant."

The company will make its public debut at the Paris Air Show later this month.

The new model, equipped with uprated engines and winglets will be available in 2014. Company sources said that the new version will become standard for all Seville assembled CN295 beginning from the fourth quarter of 2014, following the completion of certification, expected by the middle of next year.

The aircraft uses the same Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127 turboprops engines which power all versions of the C295. The increased power is available from implementing new procedures recently certified by Canada and Spain, permitting operation in the climb and cruise phases at higher power settings at the discretion of the operator. When implemented at higher altitude and hot temperatures, these procedures improve operation over very high terrain such as the Andes or Himalaya mountains with only a minor influence on maintenance cost. The winglets were demonstrated in flight-trials which showed positive results for a weight penalty of only around 90kg."

The agreement with a little-known German leasing company, Doric Asset Finance, was for 20 planes, and was valued at $8.1 billion at list prices. Doric was Airbus’s first new customer in nearly two years for its superjumbo plane, which typically seats around 525 passengers.

The order came on the opening day of the Paris Air Show amid a flurry of announcements of orders for wide-body planes made by Airbus’s American rival, Boeing, including a planned stretch model of its flagship 787 Dreamliner and a long-range version of its popular 777 jet."

The long-awaited sortie is a milestone for Airbus as it battles against Boeing's 787 Dreamliner for sales of a new generation of lightweight jets made from carbon-plastic material designed to save fuel and open up new long-distance routes.

Boeing was quickest off the mark with the revolutionary carbon-composite technology and its Dreamliner has outsold the A350 with sales standing at 833 aircraft for 57 customers.

Airbus hopes to catch up and also mount a challenge to the U.S. manufacturer's larger, metallic 777 using a later version of the A350.

Up and away: The new Airbus A350 aircraft takes off for its first test flight from Airbus's plant in Toulouse, France this morning

A large crowd gathered at the runway at the Airbus factory in Toulouse to see A350's first flight

The Airbus A350 will be a rival to Boeing's problematic Dreamliner jets which had to be grounded following battery failures

Airbus is finalising orders from Singapore Airlines , Kuwait Airways and Air France and may add a new customer at the June 17-23 show, analysts say.

Evrard said that Airbus would soon add a customer in the United States, where industry sources say that United Airlines is negotiating to upgrade and expand an existing order to 35 jets.

Airbus initially dismissed the threat posed by the new generation of mid-sized aircraft as it focused on building the world's largest airliner, the A380 superjumbo.

But faced with burgeoning Dreamliner sales, it changed tack and overhauled the design of the A350 by adopting similar composites technology in 2006.

Airbus plans to offer three variants of the A350 XWB, with the smallest, the A350 800, a rival to Boeing's Dreamliner 787-9 and 787-8 jets

The sleek jet with curled wingtips took off with a crew of six wearing parachutes and orange jumpsuits and with tonnes of test equipment on board

The high-tech jet, the company's first all-new plane in eight years, is built primarily from carbon composites and features fly-by-wire technology

To boost sales, Boeing is expected to confirm plans to build a larger version of its Dreamliner. It is also overhauling its 777 with new engines and wings.

The A350 is due to enter service in the second half of 2014 compared with an initial target of 2012 when it was launched as Europe's answer to the light-weight 787 Dreamliner.

Airbus plan to offer three variants of the A350.



The A350-800 is designed to compete with Boeing's 787-9 and 787-8 Dreamliners. It will have space for 270 passengers with a range of 8,500 nautical miles. The two aircraft are almost identical in terms of speed, capacity, range and cost.

AIRBUS A350 800 XWD

CRUISING SPEED: Mach 0.85

CAPACITY: 270 (3 class configuration)

RANGE: 8,500 nautical miles

CAPACITY: 255-290 (3 class configuration) RANGE: 8,000 - 8,500 nautical miles

COST: $243.6 million



Delays: The Airbus construction facilities in Hamburg. The A350 was originally planned to be ready by 2012



The A350-900, a rival to Boeing's 777-200ER, is expected to seat 314 passengers in a three-class layout with a range of 8,100 nautical miles.

Finally the A350-1000, which is designed to take on the 777-300ER, will seat 350 passengers with a range of 8,400 nautical miles. Boeing, still recovering from problems with the lithium batteries on its 787 Dreamliner, currently dominates the long-haul market with the 787 and 777.



'The first flight is a very special moment in an aerospace company,' Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus's parent company EADS, said late Thursday.

Airbus made the decision to drop Lithium-Ion batteries and switch to traditional nickel-cadmium cells for the A350 in the wake of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner's 'exploding battery' mystery.



Teething problems: All 50 of Boeing's Dreamliners were grounded following two on-board fires, believed to have been sparked by faulty batteries

The Airbus A350 has taken off on its maiden flight, setting the stage for intensifying competition with US rival Boeing in the long-haul aircraft market.



Today's flight from Toulouse is to last about four hours and marks a key step on the path to full certification. It is Airbus's first all-new plane in eight years.



The A350 XWB family comprises of three versions which seat between 270 and 350 passengers. The aircraft has been developed to be more fuel efficient than other mid-size long range aircraft.



More than half of the A350 is made up of lightweight carbon-fibre, designed to save on jet fuel, which makes up about half the cost of long-haul flights. Airbus say the aircraft uses 25% less fuel than competitors, providing an equivalent reduction in CO 2 emissions.



The wings, landing gear and fuel system were developed at Airbus's Filton site, with wings produced in Broughton.

Key facts about A350 wings:



The wings are 32m long and six metres wide

They are the largest single civil aviation parts ever made from carbon fibre composite material

The design includes droop-nose leading edge devices to make them more streamlined

New adaptive dropped-hinge flaps increase the plane’s efficiency at low speeds

To improve high-speed performance the aircraft can deflect its wing flaps symmetrically and asymmetrically to optimise the wing profile, which gives better control of loads along the wing

The A350 XWB is powered by Rolls-Royce's Trent XWB engine, which is a development of the Trent 900 and Trent 1000. Rolls-Royce say the engine is the most fuel efficient large engine design currently available, with 28 per cent better fuel efficiency than pre-Trent generation engines.

The Trent XWB has a thrust of up to 93,000lb and uses an updated version of Rolls-Royce’s existing three-shaft architecture. Design features of the engine include blisks, contra-rotation, low hub-tip ratio swept fan and new materials technology. According to Rolls-Royce the engine also incorporate the latest noise and emissions reduction technology.

An international crew of six is on board the first flight, comprising two flight test pilots, one test flight engineer and three flight test engineers. It marks the beginning of a test campaign that will involve 2,500 flying hours and a fleet of five development aircraft. The tests will lead to the certification of the A350-900 variant by the European and US airworthiness authorities.



Boeing is still recovering from problems with the lithium batteries on its 787 Dreamliner, and Airbus hopes to challenge its lead in the lucrative long haul market with the A350 XWB.



Tom Enders, chief executive of Airbus parent company EADS, said: “The first flight is a very special moment in an aerospace company.”



The aircraft is due to enter into service in the second half of 2014. Airbus has 613 firm orders for the aircraft from 33 customers worldwide.

Europe’s newest passenger jet, the Airbus A350, successfully took its maiden flight on Friday.

Around 10,000 spectators, including many Airbus employees, watched as the jet took off from Airbus’s Toulouse plant under cloudy skies. The plane, with its curled wingtips, was carrying a crew of six people equipped with parachutes and orange jumpsuits, along with tonnes of test equipment.

The flight, led by two British and French former fighter pilots, was expected to last four hours and is the result of eight years of development that have cost more than 11 billion euros.

Airbus and Boeing – with its 787 Dreamliner – are engaged in a battle for supremacy in a new generation of lightweight carbon-composite jets designed to save fuel and open new long-distance routes.

A350 flyby expected at Le Bourget

Our Paris correspondent Giovanni Magi“We are confident that we can make the first flight of the A350 at the same time of Le Bourget air show in 2013.” That’s what Airbus’ top manager told me in May 2011, when I was filming a story for our aviation magazine “Fly” in Toulouse. And that confidence turned out to be well founded with the maiden flight performed Friday, June 14, not an easy task when it comes to launch an all-new airliner.

Now the general public expects to see up-close the newest member of the Airbus family. A flyby is scheduled in the skies over Le Bourget next Friday or Saturday, probably at a time when French President François Hollande visits the exhibition.

The A350 should make a low pass over Le Bourget’s runway, in a ‘missed approach’; she will not touch the ground before resuming her route to Toulouse. To make the fly-by possible, the prototype will need to have accumulated at least 10 flight hours in tests over the next few days.

First flight of Airbus A350 reopens wide-body race - cleveland.com,"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAxMy8wNi9maXJzdF9mbGlnaHRfb2ZfYWlyYnVzX2EzNTBfcmUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS -- The Airbus A350's maiden flight ended with a safe landing on Friday, setting the stage for intensifying competition with U.S. rival Boeing in the long-haul wide-body aircraft market.

The four-hour flight marks a key step on the path to full certification for the jet, which can carry between 250 and 400 passengers and is the European aircraft maker's best hope for catching up in a long-haul market dominated by Boeing's 787 and 777. Airspace at the airport in the southern French city of Toulouse, where Airbus has its headquarters, closed for both take-off and landing.

Airbus has 613 orders for the A350, and hopes Friday's flight will bring it momentum heading into next week's Paris Air Show, which is already shaping up as a battle of the wide-body planes.

More than half of the twin-engine jet consists of lightweight carbon-fiber designed to save on jet fuel, which makes up half the cost of long-haul flights.

The A350, which was delayed for two years as Airbus hashed out the new design, is a direct competitor with the 787 Dreamliner -- minus the lithium ion batteries now under investigation for unexplained smoldering. Airbus abandoned its plans to use the lithium ion batteries despite their advantages in weight, power and re-charging speed.

""The A350 has the same innovations more or less as the Dreamliner, the 787,"" said Gerard Feldzer, a French aviation expert and former airline pilot. ""It is pretty much equivalent, the same amount or proportion of carbon for the lightness of the material, just as many electrical devices.""

Boeing's list prices for its 787 line range from $206 million to $243 million. Airbus lists prices ranging from $254 million to $332 million, and had 613 orders as of May, compared with 890 orders for the 787. Steep discounts are common on large orders, although the details are rarely made public.

Airbus claims the A350 burns 25 percent less fuel than the Boeing due to its lighter weight, redesigned Rolls Royce engines and new aerodynamics.

""The first flight is a very special moment in an aerospace company,"" Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus parent company EADS, said late Thursday."
Airbus A350 XWB makes surprise visit to Paris Air Show - New Atlas,"Fri, 21 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXh3Yi1wYXJpcy1haXItc2hvdy8yODAyMS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"There was a surprise appearance at the Paris Air Show on Friday as the first prototype Airbus A350 XWB airliner did a flyover for the crowds at Le Bourget Airport. The flyover was part of what was the aircraft’s third time in the air and was a last minute bonus appearance due to it performing much better than expected on its previous two test flights.

Designated MSN1 in Airbus’ numbering system, the jetliner took off from the Airbus headquarters in Toulouse at 10:50 AM CEST (08:50 GMT) and headed north for Le Bourget where it arrived at about 1:30 PM (11:30 GMT) under an overcast sky. Airbus Captain Peter Chandler and Captain Guy Magrin made a slow turn over the airfield at an altitude of 600 ft (183 m) and flew along the air show runway past the crowd. After clearing the area, it turned away to continue its test flight and disappeared into the cloud cover.

This was the first appearance of the A350 XWB at a public event. French president François Hollande was a special guest at the air show and one of the reasons for the appearance.

The A350 WXB is made mostly of advanced materials and composites

This appearance is unusual in that this is only the third time the A350 XWB has flown. It was the craft’s third test flight with the first flight on June 14 and the second on the 19th. According to Airbus the flights were, “Just what [the pilots] expected; what they experienced in the flight simulator.”

The results of the first two tests prompted Airbus to open the flight envelope to high speeds and high altitude, which made the appearance at the airshow possible. The fly-by was cleared with France’s DGAC civil aviation authority and the Paris Air Show organizers and will count as part of the 2,500 hours of test flights to be conducted by a fleet of five development aircraft for the A350’s certification.

Under development at an estimated cost of €12 billion (US$15 billion, £10 billion), The A350 XWB comes in three variants seating 270 to 350 passengers in three class layouts. It’s a long-range airliner powered by two Rolls Royce XWB Trent engines putting out 84,000 lb of thrust each that were built especially for the plane that has a cruising speed of Mach 0.85 (903 km/h, 561 mph, 487 knots).

It is also the first Airbus plane to be built with 70 percent advanced materials with both the fuselage and wings made mostly of carbon composites. The wings are the largest ever produced for a wide-body plane.

According to Airbus, the A350 XWB has a 25 percent advantage over the Boeing 777 in terms of fuel efficiency and a eight percent advantage over the 787. At the time of the flyover, 678 orders from 34 customers had been placed for the A350 with the first recipient being Qatar Airways, which will take 80 aircraft made up of all three variants.

Delivery of these aircraft is due to commence in 2018, with plans to operate the aircraft on United Airlines long haul network.

Singapore Airlines has increased its orders for Airbus A350, with commitments for an additional 30 A350-900’s and 20 options that can be taken as a -900 or a -1000 model, firming up an order it has after announcing a commitment to purchase earlier. This increases Singapore Airlines A350 orders to 70 firm and 20 options.

Hong Kong Aviation Capital has signed with Airbus for narrow body jets, with a Memorandum of Understanding for 40 Airbus A320neo and 20 Airbus A321neo (new engine option) aircraft.

Spirit Airlines have also been buying narrowbody Airbus aircraft, with a firm order of 20 Airbus A321’s – as well as converting 10 options it has into orders for another 10 A321’s (orignally A320’s) – a total of 30 aircraft. These will be A321ceo’s (current engine option) featuring Sharlets on as the wingtip devices.

Over at Boeing, a few extra orders to top off the order book.

Travel Service of the Czech Republic will be introducing the 737-MAX 8 into Central and Eastern Europe with the commitment to purchase 3 aircraft.

Oman Air has confirmed an order with Boeing for five Boeing 737-900ER aircraft to add to its existing fleet. This will mean Oman Air will be the first operator of the 737-900ER in the Middle East.

Meanwhile in the Turboprop world, ATR has been gathering a few orders.

First up is Air Lease International who will be ordering five ATR 72-600 aircraft, and LAIT will be adding another three ATR 42-600 to their fleets.

And with that, the business side of the Paris Air Show comes to an end, and the the joy of aircraft watching and spotting begins…

And if you’re at Le Borget tomorrow… keep an eye in the sky. A certain very new aircraft will be making its Paris Air Show début…"

Occasionally, these companies decide to have a bit of a chat between each other on Twitter, and the conclusion of the first Airbus A350 was one of those moments.

As the celebration at Toulouse began, several competitors and airlines took to Twitter to congratulate Airbus on their big day. The first competitor to congratulate Airbus was their biggest rival, Boeing. At the time of publishing, that tweet received 247 retweets, as well as a response from Airbus saying “Thanks! A 1st flight is always a great day 4 our industry.”

Typically aircraft are pressurized to an altitude of 2800m which gives some passengers mild altitude sickness with impacts such as mild headaches.

However, because the 787 and A350 are made of composite structure which is stronger than aluminium the pressurization can be increased to the equivalent of a 2000m altitude removing the impact of altitude sickness.

And composite structure does not corrode so the humidity can be increased thus reducing the impact of dehydration.

The A350 can fly up to 15,000km.

There are three models with capacity between 270 in a three-class international configuration for the A350-800 to 550 in the largest model the -1000 with an all economy layout.

First deliveries will be to Qatar Airways in 2014.

Airbus has sold 615 A350s, while Boeing has sold almost 900 787s.

The A350 opens a new chapter in Airbus’ 43 year history.

Equipped with Rolls-Royce Trent XWB turbofans, the A350 XWB first flight took place over south western France.

An international crew of six was on board, comprising two Flight Test Pilots, one Test Flight Engineer and three Flight Test Engineers.

At the controls of the A350 XWB’s first flight are Peter Chandler, Airbus’ Chief Test Pilot, and Guy Magrin, Project Pilot for the A350 XWB.

Accompanying them in the cockpit is Pascal Verneau, the A350 XWB Project Test Flight Engineer.

At their flight test stations in the main aircraft cabin and monitoring the progress of the flight via an extensive array of flight test instrumentation are the three flight test engineers: Fernando Alonso, Head of Airbus Flight & Integration Test Centre; Patrick du Ché, Head of Development Flight Tests; and Emanuele Costanzo, lead Flight Test Engineer for the Trent XWB engine.

This first flight marks the beginning of a test campaign totaling around 2,500 flight hours with a fleet of five development aircraft.

The rigorous flight testing will lead to the certification of the A350-900 variant by the European EASA and US FAA airworthiness authorities, prior to entry into service in the second half of 2014 with first operator Qatar Airways."

The four-hour flight from Toulouse marks a key step on the path to full certification for the jet, which can carry between 250 and 400 passengers and is the European aircraft maker's best hope for catching up in a long-haul market dominated by Boeing's 787 and 777.

Toulouse airspace closed for both take-off and landing.

Airbus has 613 orders for the A350, and hopes Friday's flight will bring it momentum heading into next week's Paris Air Show, which is already shaping up as a battle of the wide-body planes.

More than half of the twin-engine jet consists of lightweight carbon-fiber designed to save on jet fuel, which makes up half the cost of long-haul flights.

The A350, which was delayed for two years as Airbus hashed out the new design, is a direct competitor with the 787 Dreamliner -- minus the lithium ion batteries now under investigation for unexplained smouldering. Airbus abandoned its plans to use the lithium ion batteries despite their advantages in weight, power and re-charging speed.

""The A350 has the same innovations more or less as the Dreamliner, the 787,"" said Gerard Feldzer, a French aviation expert and former airline pilot. ""It is pretty much equivalent, the same amount or proportion of carbon for the lightness of the material, just as many electrical devices.""

Boeing's list prices for its 787 line range from $206 million to $243 million. Airbus lists prices ranging from $254 million to $332 million, and had 613 orders as of May, compared with 890 orders for the 787. Steep discounts are common on large orders, although the details are rarely made public.

Airbus claims the A350 burns 25 per cent less fuel than the Boeing due to its lighter weight, redesigned Rolls Royce engines and new aerodynamics.

""The first flight is a very special moment in an aerospace company,"" Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus parent company EADS, said late Thursday."

We stepped inside to see what the European plane maker came up with, and it's impressive.

Airbus made the controls for the A350 similar to those for its A380, A320, and A350/A340, so pilots who change from one to another can skip the lengthy training course.

Airbus offers dual heads-up screen displays (one for each pilot). The pilot looks out the windshield through the display, which shows crucial information and makes taking off and landing safer. (Dual HUDs are standard in the Boeing 787).

Where the A380, the most recent brand new commercial jet from Airbus, had 10 LCD screens, the A350 will have six larger screens displaying flight information and controls, including navigation.

The systems control (overhead) and flight control unit (akin to a car's dashboard) will be very similar to those in other Airbus products, test pilot Jean-Michel Roy told Gizmodo.

It is, he said, ""probably the best, most advanced cockpit in the world.""

Europe's newest passenger jet, the Airbus A350, successfully began its maiden flight on Friday. [Provided to chinadaily.com.cn]

European airplane manufacturer Airbus' newest aircraft, the A350, successfully took off on its first test flight on Friday from France’s southwestern city of Toulouse.

With a total investment of $15 billion, the launch of the new aircraft was seen as a major effort by Airbus to challenge its US rival Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner in the long-distance market.

The A350 is Airbus' mid-size long-range airplane seating between 270 and 350 passengers. It is designed to be more fuel-efficient, using 25 percent less fuel compared with existing aircraft of same size and providing an equivalent of reduction in CO2 emissions, according to the company.

Each A350 aircraft costs around $250 to 330 million and consumes 6 percent less oil than Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, according to market analysts.

China also participated in about 5 percent of the design and manufacturing of the aircraft's body.

Friday's flight marked the beginning of a test campaign totaling around 2,500 flight hours with a fleet of five development aircraft.

The aircraft is expected to enter into service in the second half of 2014.

Analysts said the new A350 will gradually replace the older A330, a popular plane that is believed to have generated almost half of the company’s revenues in recent years, according to French media reports.

The company is bullish about future orders for the A350 and is hoping to win more at next week's international air show in Paris.

""I believe that the air show next week should be good for a few hundred orders for Airbus,"" Tom Enders, head of Airbus' parent company EADS, was quoted by Reuters as saying.

To date the A350 has already won 613 firm orders from 33 customers worldwide. China is expected to order 1,000 such aircraft in the next 20 years, according to the company."

The bags include RFID chips for next-generation airline baggage handling and a barcode that syncs with an iPhone app that includes a 'Find My Bag' feature that hooks into airline databases to give you up-to-the-minute data on the bags location. They also have a digital scale built into the handle of the bag that talks to the iPhone's app.

Flyers simply lift up on the handle and the digital scale makes sure the bag is beneath an airline's weight limit. The airline believes the bags would cost some 20% more than comparable 'dumb' bags.

Christened 'Bag2Go', the concept has been developed in partnership with mobile carrier T-Mobile and German luggage maker Rimowa. An RFID chip inside the bag lets it work with the increasing number of automated airport and airline baggage-handling systems which can 'pair' smartchipped bagtags with your itinerary and frequent flyer number. A barcode on the bag’s trip-specific label syncs it against your iPhone and can be passed on to your airline booking.

Airbus says it would not sell the bags directly but could license the technology to partner airlines."
The debate over using DOT Form 41in comparing A320 and 737 costs - Leeham News and Analysis,"Tue, 18 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMy8wNi8xOC90aGUtZGViYXRlLW92ZXItdXNpbmctZG90LWZvcm0tNDFpbi1jb21wYXJpbmctYTMyMC1hbmQtNzM3LWNvc3RzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Long time readers know that we don’t think much of the veracity of data filed with the US Department of Transportation under Form 41, detailing maintenance and fuel costs. We know from a consultant who helped an airline create its methodology for filing the data that the airline “fudges” the methodology to distort the data for competitive reasons.

Boeing has cited Form 41 data for years in making its comparisons between the 737 and the Airbus A320. A key piece of information Boeing uses is the maintenance cost data, in which Boeing claims the 737 was up to 29% less costly to maintain than the A320. This comparison in particular drives Airbus crazy, and officials say the Form 41 data is “garbage.”

Boeing also previously used a study from IATA from 2006-2009, but dropped that in this year’s comparisons at the pre-Paris Air Show briefings.

Boeing also relies on DOT 41 data for fuel comparisons.

Beverly Wyse, VP and general manager of the 737 NG program, emphasized the reliance on DOT data in the comparisons.

“You don’t just have to believe us,” she said during the briefings. “We know that out there in the market ‘Airbus says,’ ‘Boeing says,’ and it’s hard to find the truth, so wherever we can we’re trying to use independent sources to substantiate the information that we are providing you. This data actually comes from the US department of Transportation Form 41. Depending on the model, and the configuration of the aircraft, the Dash 800 compared to an A320 or the A321 compared to the 900ER, you’ll see between 5% and 8% better fuel efficiency for the 737.”

Wyse credited the 737’s rival with good dispatch reliability, a rare Boeing compliment of the A320. But she claimed the 737 was nonetheless better.

“The A320 and 737 both have incredible reliability. Anything with 99 point something reliability is something to be proud of. The simpler design of the 737 contributes to 20% lower maintenance costs resulting in 67 fewer days out of service,” she says.

Given the reliance on DOT Form 41 data and our open doubts about using this data, we followed up with a series of questions to Boeing. Here is the exchange.

Boeing cites DOT 41 data in claiming the 737NG costs 20%-24% less on maintenance than the A320. First, DOT 41 data is crap. The airlines manipulate the data to mask what their true costs are from competitors. So how does Boeing purport to un-crap it?

DOT F41 data is a good source because it has rigorous reporting processes, contains constant costs in U.S. dollars, and includes reported data by operators who maintain both aircraft fleets, insuring consistent accounting practices. But it is not the only source of data for our claims. That goes toward your second question…

Secondly, Bev in one-on-one said, well, Boeing compares maintenance schedules between the 737 and the A320. Which is it? DOT 41 or company manuals?

The Maintenance Schedules or Check Intervals (that is the interval between performing various levels of Checks, typically classifieds as A, C and D-Checks) are obtained from our company manuals and for the A320, from industry publications and conferences. Specific A320 check intervals are periodically announced in Airbus press releases, journals and conference papers. It may be noted that F41 data provides a look at historic data while the Maintenance Planning Document (MPD) provides the check intervals for the future occurrence of check events. The continuous improvements that occur in the Boeing MPD usually result in even lower maintenance costs to airlines than being currently reported in F41 data. Our focus is to enable the airlines to continuously reduce their operating costs including maintenance costs through better product and services.

Third, I know from my own sourcing from within Boeing that to get to 24%, Boeing has compared new 737s to the oldest A320s using the earliest engines. When new-to-new is compared, the delta is 4% in favor of Boeing. Bev responds to this that this is a fleet-wide analysis.

Bev is absolutely correct; we use fleet-wide data in our comparison. There are many differences in the fleets of different airlines, like airplane age and the average stage length (Fhrs/Trip). Both affect maintenance costs. To enable true comparison, maintenance cost is normalized for a common airplane age. Since A320 is usually an older airplane the normalization process actually reduces the A320 costs to bring it to say a level of 737NG airplane age (say 8 years). Without normalization for age, the cost difference would be an additional 4 to 5% to the advantage of 737NG, but we diligently apply our processes while showing the relative cost and remove this fleet age based difference . Similarly, costs are normalized for stage length and some other factors. All these normalizing processes are approved by the IATA Maintenance Cost Task Force of which both Boeing and Airbus are also members and uniformly used by most of the industry. We compare costs and do modeling in our tools on basis of the normalized costs.

In summary: All maintenance costs are compared on basis of like airplane age. Our multi level data analysis is for “as reported data”, normalized data and data from airlines operating both airplane types. In each case, the airframe costs for the 737NG are lower and on an average 20 percent lower.

Fourth point: If this is a fleet-wide analysis, how is this possibly fair? The NG didn’t enter service until 10 years after the A320, so maintenance on aging aircraft skews everything.

Maintenance cost data is normalized to the same age level for instances where the airplane ages are different. This is done for each airline and then grouped together. The analysis ensured we were comparing like-aged aircraft not the entire fleet. By that comparison, the 737 has about 20% (+/-) lower airframe maintenance cost than the A320. But consider that there also are a number of other factors …

Five facts that drive lower maintenance cost for the 737:

1. Newer simple value added design

2. Lighter weight, smaller size;

3. Fewer systems

4. Fewer installed components

5. Longer intervals; fewer maintenance visits

Airlines believe and give us credit for our maintenance story.

If there were truly a 20%-24% maintenance delta, why would anyone buy the A320? It doesn’t all come down to price, you know. The A320ceo evenly splits the market with the 738 but the A321ceo outsells the 739 by a wide margin and the neo widely outsells the MAX.

Maintenance and its cost is only one of the criteria by which airlines judge airplanes, and a relatively small one at that. Airframe Maintenance is usually 4 to 5 percent of cash operating cost. However, maintenance and reliability plays an important role in the operational experience for an airline. Price is an important factor in airline decisions, but you are correct that it doesn’t all come down to that. As you’re aware, for example, there can be political issues, or even funding issues. As for the division of the single-aisle market, we are very aware of the inroads Airbus has made in its relatively short existence and are very much motivated by that. Arguably, that’s another reason some airlines opt for one plane or another. So, too, is the ability to deliver an airplane when an airline wants or needs it. The on-time reliability of one model or the other can be a factor (while both companies produce reliable airplanes, Boeing’s 737s have better on-time statistics). Too, some airlines prefer to stick with airplanes compatible with their installed fleet to reduce maintenance, training and scheduling costs. The choice is very complex.

I note, too, that this year Bev dropped citing the 2006-2009 IATA maintenance data. How come?

IATA data is used extensively within our own internal analysis. However, we acknowledge that there are some issues with IATA data. IATA airlines do not report data consistently over a long period. They may drop out entirely, miss reporting in some years and new airlines may join for a period. The Form 41 (US DoT) data is mandatory to report and usually aligns with the airline’s Annual Reports reported costs. In addition, variation in currency exchange rates becomes come into the picture. Airlines report in their own currency and that is converted to U.S. dollars. Inconsistency of reporting and the additional currency variable frequently clouds the data.

Bev says, though, that what tipped its use in the end in these slides, however, was that the data we had at the time was old.

We asked Airbus for a response to some of these questions. Engaged in the Air Show this week, we have yet to hear back.

To provide the air forces of Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, Turkey and the UK - plus first export customer Malaysia - with a tactical airlifter capable of carrying a maximum payload of 37t, the A400M has been designed to occupy a niche between the USA's smaller Lockheed Martin C-130J and larger Boeing C-17.

Significant product development work is still being conducted on Airbus Military's C295 medium transport, which can carry a cargo of up to 9t. This includes a winglet-equipped production standard to be delivered to customers from 2014, plus a version on offer to several potential buyers with an airborne early warning and control system developed by Israel Aerospace Industries' Elta Systems subsidiary.

Speaking in Seville on 29 May, Ureña-Raso said the company's next development task could be to create an offering to fit below the size of the C-130 Hercules. Possible payload capacities for such a product could be in the 9t area already occupied by the current C295, or in the ""16-18t"" sector, he said. The latter would pit any such transport in the same broad category as Embraer's turbofan-powered KC-390 transport and tanker, which the Brazilian company says will be able to lift between 16 and 23t, depending on mission type. Embraer's developmental product should be ready for service introduction with the Brazilian air force during 2016.

Despite his hints at Airbus Military's possible future development strategy, Ureña-Raso notes that no such activity will be launched in the short-term, while final assembly of the A400M continues to ramp up and the company also pursues a ""second wave"" of orders for its Airbus A330-based multi-role tanker transport, and further orders for its C295 product line.

The event came only days before the Paris Air Show, with lucrative orders expected to come in.

Airbus's next-generation A350 plane landed safely in Toulouse following its first test flight Friday. After just over four hours in the air, the new plane touched down to cheers from Airbus employees and hundreds of aviation enthusiasts who had assembled on a nearby hill to watch the landmark flight.

The plane was manned by a British and a French test pilot plus a number of flight engineers at the back.

Tom Enders, the head of Airbus' parent company, EADS, described the test flight as ""a galvanizing moment"" for the entire group. ""It's a very special moment in the life of a company,"" he commented.

The maiden flight came ahead of Monday's opening of the Paris Air Show. ""I believe the show next week should be good for a few hundred orders for Airbus,"" Enders said.

More than half of the new A350 long-haul plane is made of light composite materials that reduce fuel costs dramatically. It will gradually replace the A330 which has generated almost half of the firm's revenues in recent years.

Eternal rivalry

Airbus hopes the A350 will be able to challenge Boeing's lead in the lucrative long-haul market, particularly after the US rival's problems with its 787 Dreamliner.

Following Friday's maiden flight, the jet is to enter a test-flying period that Airbus hopes will last less than 18 months, with the first delivery expected at the end of next year. Confirmed clients so far include Qatar Airways, British Airways and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific.

Aviation analyst Nick Cunningham warned that the test-flying period might still reveal a number of problems engineers didn't have on their radar yet. ""They start building aircraft before they finish certifying and testing, so if you run into any issues, it gets very expensive as you have to fix the ones you already built,"" Cunningham explained.

It may not be the biggest plane to ever fly the skies, but the Airbus A350 is the newest plane by the aircraft manufacturer and it comes touting some unique features. The A350 completed a four-hour flight earlier this morning, which marked the first time that the plane has taken to the skies. It will undergo 2,500 hours of testing before it goes into service starting late next year.

The plane took off and landed at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport in France in front of 12,000 or so onlookers wanting to get a glimpse of the first flight of the new plane. The A350 is a two-engine intercontinental plane, and it's the first new model from Airbus since the A380 jumbo jet that saw its debut in 2005.

The A350 aims to take on Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, and it's mostly built out of lightweight carbon-fiber composites, rather than traditional aluminum. The lighter weight will significantly cut down on fuel costs as well as maintenance costs, but the plane itself wasn't cheap to develop — around $14 billion.

During the flight, the on-board he crew explored the aircraft's flight envelope, and the plane was accompanied by a chase plane that observed and filmed the A350's various maneuvers for analysis later on. Flight experts on the ground were also monitoring the plane in real-time to track its health.

The plane will obviously go through a series of tests involving five A350 aircrafts before it can be certified to fly commercially, and that involves around 2,500 flight hours that need to be completed. However, Airbus is planning for an official launch of the new plane at some point during the second half of 2014 with Qatar Airways getting the first batch of A350s.

Being Electric Doesn't Keep This Plane From Serious Aerobatics - WIRED,"Tue, 18 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS8yMDEzLzA2L2UtZmFuLWVsZWN0cmljLWFpcnBsYW5lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

LE BOURGET, France – The Airbus A380 is among the biggest stars here at the Paris Air Show, but no less impressive is the sleek electric aerobatic trainer that is its distant cousin.

The E-Fan is the brainchild of Didier Esteyne, an engineer and pilot with a knack for electric aircraft. Two years ago he unveiled an electric version of the diminutive Cri-Cri, which made its debut here last year. Esteyne worked with EADS – corporate parent to Airbus – on the Cri-Cri, and the two decided to team up again on what became the E-Fan.

The project got the green light in October, and Esteyne has been working frantically to finish the plane in time for Paris. This is the 50th anniversary of the show, which draws everyone in the aerospace industry to the airport where Charles Lindbergh landed after flying solo across the Atlantic in 1927. There's always plenty of new technology on display here, and the E-Fan is at the leading edge of electric aviation.

Its most unusual aspect is the ducted fan propulsion. Rather than use a traditional propeller driven by an electric motor like other electric airplanes we've seen (and flown), Esteyne uses a pair of motors with ducted fans – essentially small propellers within a cowling.

""The idea was to have a little motor, with the good thrust,"" Esteyne said, standing next to his airplane. The arrangement allows him to get sufficient thrust for flight using much less power than typically found in a two-seater of this size. The upside to that is, of course, the ability to use a smaller battery pack, thereby saving weight – and money.

""This plane, with these dimensions, can fly with 20 kilowatts [per side], easy,"" he said.

This approach is quite different than we've seen from the likes of, say, electric pioneer Chip Yates, who has installed a 193-kilowatt motor in the 200-mph electric airplane he built. The E-Fan will accommodate more powerful motors, Esteyne said, and a final configuration has not been set.

The E-Fan has a wingspan of just over 31 feet and a maximum weight of 1,212 pounds. Juice is stored in a pair of 250 volt, 40 amp-hour multi-cell lithium ion battery packs in each wing root. Esteyne says the current setup provides an hour's flying at about 110 mph. To maximize flight time, one main landing gear wheel has a small electric motor that can propel the airplane up to 35 mph, which is more efficient than using thrust to taxi.

The airplane is designed as a trainer, and, as with the Cri-Cri, it is capable of aerobatics. Start doing a lot of loops and barrel rolls, though, and your range falls to 30 minutes because of the power needed for vertical flight and other maneuvers. Half an hour may not sound like much, but that's about all the aerobatic flight the average pilot can handle anyway.

Basic taxi training has gone well, and Esteyne hopes to make an inaugural flight this fall. The goal is to see the plane certified for flight instruction and general aviation use."
"May's top stories: UK unmanned aircraft in flight, Airbus $8.9bn China order - Aerospace Technology","Mon, 03 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9zcGFjZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9mZWF0dXJlbWF5LXN0b3JpZXMtdWstdW5tYW5uZWQtYWlyY3JhZnQtZmxpZ2h0LWFpcmJ1cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In May, LaserMotive unveiled the world’s first tethered vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) unmanned aircraft system (UAS), which is powered by laser over optical fibre.

InvisiTower is capable of powering any multirotor helicopter using laser power sent through a fibre optic cable, allowing the helicopter to fly as long as power is available on the ground.

The system can be used to support a range of applications in the military and civilian markets, including ISR and situational awareness, communications relay, news and sports reporters, first responders and industrial facility security.

Researchers at German Aerospace Center, Deutsches Zentrum für Luft-und Raumfahrt (DLR), have developed a new receiver and antenna to track aircraft from satellites.

Developed in partnership with the DLR Institute of Flight Guidance in Braunschweig, the new technology will locate the ADS-B (automatic dependent surveillance – broadcast) signals that flights broadcast using a special antenna.



The receiver will be carried onboard the European Proba-V satellite, which is set to liftoff on a Vega launcher, with the primary mission of observing vegetation from space.

Scientists at DLR intend to test during the next two years whether continuous monitoring of aviation routes is possible.

Doha-based carrier Qatar Airways is in talks with European aircraft manufacturer Airbus to purchase up to 15 twin-engine A330 passenger airliners in a deal estimated to be worth approximately $3.6bn.

The airline is considering Airbus aircraft following production delays of 787s and the grounding of its five 787 Dreamliners in January due to battery problems.

The deal is expected to be finalised in June this year during the Paris Airshow.

Qatar Airways is also considering options for the purchase of more four-engine A380 superjumbo airliners.

Also this month, an unmanned BAE Systems Jetstream aircraft known as ‘The Flying Test Bed’ successfully completed its maiden flight, marking the world’s first unmanned flight across the UK-shared airspace.

The aircraft, specially adapted to fly in unmanned mode, took off from Warton in Lancashire and landed in Inverness, Scotland.

BAE Systems noted that this development marked another step forward in the evolution of flight and proves that future technology of this kind could be safe.

The twin-turboprop airliner carried two onboard pilots as a precaution. However, it was under the control of a pilot on the ground at Warton and National Air Traffic Services (NATS) controllers.

Meanwhile in Germany, Eurocopter has officially opened its new Systemhaus helicopter development centre at its Donauwörth site.

The 30,000m² centre provides workspace for approximately 900 employees and offers complete system capability for Eurocopter’s production activity.

The Systemhaus building features testing and research facilities, which include simulators, avionics trainers, laboratories, test centres and a prototype shop.

It is also home to the system support centre (SUZ) for the German armed forces (Bundeswehr) helicopter fleet, including the NH90 and CH-53 transport helicopters, and the Tiger attack helicopter.

Airbus has logged an $8.9bn firm order for 100 single aisle A320 airliners from two Chinese carriers, Air China and its subsidiary, Shenzhen Airlines.

Air China has entered into a purchase agreement to acquire 60 A320 series jets for $5.37bn, based on list prices, and delivery of the aircraft is expected in stages between 2014 and 2020.

Shenzhen Airlines will purchase 40 A320 series aircraft for $3.4bn, with the delivery of airliners expected in stages between 2016 and 2020.

Both airlines will acquire 40 current engine versions of the A320, as well as 60 more fuel-efficient versions with the A320neo.

Helicopter and fixed-wing simulators manufacturer Frasca International has delivered three new flight training devices (FTDs) – two Cessna 172R FTDs and a CRJ-200 Level 5 FTD – to Southern Illinois University (SIU) Carbondale.

SIU has also upgraded its existing Frasca 172R FTD to have the same features as the two new 172R devices, including G1000, a three-channel projected cylindrical visual display and low-profile instructor cab.

The CRJ-200 Level 5 FTD features a three channel 220°x58° spherical visual display system."

Airbus's maiden flight of the prototype A350-900 from Toulouse Blagnac is set to take around 4h and test the basic handling and control characteristics of the twinjet.

The aircraft will probably be flown initially under direct flight-control law, and switched into normal law, while the envelope will be gradually expanded - increasing the airspeed and altitude - if the behaviour corresponds to predictions.

If the flight progresses smoothly the pilots will explore changes in control surface configurations and retract the landing-gear. The jet could even be taken to its maximum operating height of 43,000ft.

A350 programme chief Didier Evrard says the aircraft will ""speak to us"" during the flight test.

But he says the airframer is confident about the development, saying the ""level of uncertainty is not high"".

Six crew members, including pilots Peter Chandler and Guy Magrin, have been selected to fly on board MSN1 which is powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines.

Its first flight will begin a year-long certification programme which will eventually include five flight-test airframes, two more of which are already undergoing final assembly.

Qatar Airways is to take delivery of the first A350-900 in the second half of 2014. Evrard says the cabin for the first customer is ""fully defined"".

""We have a good grip on the aircraft itself and its customisation,"" he says.

Airbus is marketing the A350-900 as a 315-seat aircraft and intends the twinjet to have a maximum take-off weight of 268t.

The MSN001 test model of the A350 set off on its maiden flight from Toulouse-Blagnac airport at 10.00am local time.

The flight, with a crew of six including two pilots, was expected to last four hours.

More than 50 per cent of materials used to build the plane are composites, which reduce its weight.

The A350 is scheduled to start commercial flights in the second quarter of 2014 after thousands of hours of tests.

More than 11 billion euros have been invested in the programme.

The test flight allows Airbus to grab headlines ahead of Paris's Le Bourget airshow, which opens on Monday, and Airbus hopes it will boost orders in competition to Boeing's Dreamliner.

It aims to sell 5,000 A350s over the next 20 years.

Airbus unveils Concept Plane with novel aircraft design - Aerospace Technology,"Wed, 12 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9zcGFjZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LmNvbS91bmNhdGVnb3Jpc2VkL25ld3NhaXJidXMtdW52ZWlscy1jb25jZXB0LXBsYW5lLW5vdmVsLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWRlc2lnbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has unveiled a new aircraft design, the Concept Plane, at the TEDGlobal 2013 conference currently taking place Edinburgh, Scotland.

Designed by a team of structural engineers at Airbus, the Concept Plane’s relatively lightweight design is based on the human skeleton structure and is expected to lower fuel costs.

The European aircraft manufacturer stated that the aim would be to 3D print the composite material which would result in the structure.

3D printing, which is also known as additive manufacturing, is a process of creating a three-dimensional solid object of virtually any shape from a digital model.

Other concepts for the future aeroplane include an upward curve on the tail in order to reflect engine noise upwards which in turn reduces noise pollution; wings that bend and move; and seats that mould to fit the size of the passengers.



According to Airbus, the aircraft would feature longer and slimmer wings as they reduce drag and improve fuel efficiency; new lightweight ‘smart’ materials’ that help lower fuel and curbs emissions; in addition to new quieter and fuel-efficient engines.

Unlike the the traditional cabin classes in the existing commercial aircraft, in the new cabins, business and economy class would be replaced by zones that cater to the individual needs such as relaxing, playing games, holding business meetings with people on the ground.

In addition, the aircraft would feature individual floating displays and integrated sensors that would monitor health, and there could also be a virtual gaming zone for passengers.

The engineers suggested that instead of small doors at the entrance, as in the existing jetliners, the future aircraft would feature wider entrances where passengers could leave their luggage, which would be automatically delivered to their seats.

Airbus engineer Bastian Schaefer was quoted by the BBC as saying that travelling in an aeroplane in the future should be affordable for both passengers and environmentally.

""The Concept Plane’s relatively lightweight design is based on the human skeleton structure.""

However, he noted that the aircraft design alone would not solve the problems faced by the industry such as the shortage of aviation oil.

Some of these issues can be resolved using technology; however, the company is looking out for alternative fuels, Schaefer said.

A decade ago, it was suggested to use liquid hydrogen but the industry is still waiting for good storage methods for this, Schaefer added.

In addition to its new Concept Plane, Airbus also asked students from across the world to develop their own eco-efficient ideas for aviation, and has finalised five teams last week.

The ideas suggested by the teams include modifications to the engine, which is manufactured using special shape-shifting materials in order to alter airflow through the engine and lower noise pollution; as well as luggage floating on a bed of air and the use of methane as a source of energy.

The Airbus A350, Europe’s answer to Boeing’s Dreamliner, took to the air for the first time today, making its maiden flight out of Toulouse where it is assembled.

The plane’s wings were designed at an Airbus facility at Filton near Bristol, and are made at Broughton in Wales. It is powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines, which Airbus claims will help it achieve fuel savings of about 25% over previous wide-bodied jets.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: “The A350-XWB’s maiden flight is significant for Airbus, Rolls-Royce and the aerospace industry — it shows the Government’s long-term Aerospace Industrial Strategy is the right approach to ensure the UK remains Europe’s number one aerospace manufacturer.”

Airbus has already taken more than 600 orders for the new plane; there have been 890 Dreamliner orders so far. First deliveries of the A350 are expected towards the end of 2014. Like the Dreamliner, the A350 is largely built using lightweight composite materials to improve fuel consumption.

The maiden flight took place hours after Japanese airline ANA cancelled a flight by one of its Dreamliners after an engine failed to start.

The Dreamliner has been hit by a series of problems, with Japanese flights only restarting on 1 June after a four-month grounding following problems with its batteries.

Watched by more than 10,000 employees and other spectators, the A350 took off under cloudy skies, with a crew of six wearing parachutes and orange jumpsuits.

The flight was scheduled to last four hours and caps eight years of development estimated to have cost $15 billion (£9.6 billion). “The first flight is a very special moment in an aerospace company,” said Tom Enders, chief executive of parent company Eads.

The firm is hoping to pick up more orders for its first new plane in eight years at next week’s Paris Air Show.

But Boeing is expected to confirm at the same show that it will build a larger capacity Dreamliner, to carry up to 323 passengers. The current version can carry between 210 and 290 passengers.

"Airbus A350-XWB, Maiden Flight of Fuel Efficient Composite Jumbo Jet - The Green Optimistic","Fri, 14 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVub3B0aW1pc3RpYy5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAteHdiLW1haWRlbi1mbGlnaHQtb2YtZnVlbC1lZmZpY2llbnQtY29tcG9zaXRlLWp1bWJvLWpldC0yMDEzMDYxNC_SAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ncmVlbm9wdGltaXN0aWMuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXh3Yi1tYWlkZW4tZmxpZ2h0LW9mLWZ1ZWwtZWZmaWNpZW50LWNvbXBvc2l0ZS1qdW1iby1qZXQtMjAxMzA2MTQvP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Fuel efficient aircraft are critical to maintaining the bottom line in the airline industry. Recent developments in engine and aircraft design, such as the Airbus A350-XWB, have helped to push that number ever higher.

Airlines don’t measure fuel economy quite the same way as automobile manufacturers do. Where the average Toyota Prius might measure 50mpg and carry four passengers, this is hard to correlate to an airline. Instead, airlines use Seat-Miles Per Gallon [sMPG], that is, how many miles per gallon each seat gets. [No, Economy Class doesn’t get any better sMPG than First Class] According to a report in 2009 from the Department of Transportation [DOT], the average airline fuel economy was 64sMPG. This makes the Toyota Prius, at 12.5sMPG, look like a gas-guzzler! Correction: A Toyota Prius would be properly rated at 200sMPG.

By combining lightweight composite materials and a more-fuel-efficient engine design, as well as lighter electrical and electronic flight control systems, aircraft designers are pushing fuel economy higher. The latest jumbo jet from Airbus, the A350-XWB looks to beat the averages with a new line of jumbo jets seating from 270 to 350 passengers. Depending on the variant, the airline can expect better than average fuel economy, up to 25% better, according to Airbus. If my math is correct, the A350-800 is rated at 69.8sMPG, while the larger A350-1000 gets a staggering 82.3sMPG.

Last week, Airbus test-fired the engines on its new fuel efficient craft, but wasn’t ready to take off exactly yet. After testing, the Airbus A350-XWB was finally ready for its maiden flight this morning at 4am EST in Toulouse, France. The test flight went as high as 25,000ft and didn’t push to full speed, but flew well. One important part of the test flight was making the switch in the electronic control system from “direct law” to “normal law.” When under “direct law” control, the onboard computers move control surfaces exactly as the pilot commands, but under “normal law” the onboard computer calculates control surface adjustments and engine output based on the pilots’ intentions.

The flight was operated by one of the two 78-seat Bombardier Q400s that Westjet Encore has received from their initial order of 20 planes. The other initial destinations for this soon-to-be-growing regional airline are Fort St. John, Victoria and Vancouver, BC, and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Brandon, Manitoba will be added in early September. They’ll continue to grow as another 5 Q400s come into the fleet before year-end. It’s clear that Westjet has positioned their new airline to try and break the monopoly that Air Canada Express (Jazz Aviation/Chorus Aviation) has enjoyed over the years in many smaller Canadian communities. In fact, Ferio Puglieses, the new airline’s President, is pretty blunt about their objectives: “WestJet Encore is here to liberate smaller communities from the high cost of regional air travel while continuing to provide every guest with our award winning culture of care.”

Paris Air Show 2013 – Wrap-Up By Howard Slutsken 21 Jun 2013 Even though the business phase of the Paris Air Show wound down on Thursday, orders and announcements continued at a rapid pace. Airbus and Boeing had a great PAS13 ’“ Airbus had 466 orders and commitments for commercial aircraft and Boeing had 442 total. Here’s some of what happened since our last update: Ryanair converted previous commitments into a huge order for 175 Boeing 737-800s, adding to the 303 -800s that Ryanair flies. As well, they might be placing an order for the 737 MAX by year-end. Ryanair CEO Ryan O’Leary said that ’œit wouldn’t be worth doing’ if the order wasn’t for at least 200 aircraft.

Boeing announced that the 737 MAX’s Entry into Service (EIS) will be the 3rd quarter of 2017, about 6 months earlier than previously expected. Among other details released about the 737 MAX, the flight deck will have 4 large ’œlandscape’ displays, and the nose will be 8 inches higher to accommodate the larger fan diameter of it’s advanced LEAP-1B engines.

Leasing and finance company, CIT Aerospace, ordered 30 737 MAX 8s.

easyJet in talks to place $10bn aircraft order with Airbus - Aerospace Technology,"Sun, 16 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9zcGFjZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LmNvbS91bmNhdGVnb3Jpc2VkL25ld3NlYXN5amV0LXRhbGtzLXBsYWNlLTEwYm4tYWlyY3JhZnQtb3JkZXItYWlyYnVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"British low-cost carrier easyJet is in advanced talks with European aircraft manufacturer Airbus for the purchase of more than 100 jetliners in a deal estimated to be worth $10bn.

The deal would include orders for about 100 A320neo aircraft with an option for an additional 120 airliners, which will mark the carrier’s first largest order in more than a decade, according to the sources familiar with the matter.

Featuring large Sharklet wing-tip devices, the A320neo will provide a double-digit reduction in NO x emissions and reduce engine noise, according to Airbus.

In addition, it will have more than 95% airframe commonality, making it easily integrated with existing fleets, while offering a further 500nm in range or two tonnes extra payload.

The A320neo is scheduled to enter service from late-2015.



easyJet recently completed the technical evaluation of tenders from Airbus and Boeing, over its decision on the re-engined Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX, and then moved to a commercial evaluation stage, which is still ongoing.

The airline is expected to make an announcement on the order as early as this week to coincide with the Paris Air Show at Le Bourget, the sources said.

""The airline is expected to make an announcement on the order as early as this week to coincide with the Paris Air Show at Le Bourget.""

The deal would require approval from easyJet shareholders.

Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who established easyJet in 1995 and remains its largest shareholder with a 37% stake, said that the purchase of new aeroplanes would hit shareholder value, and instead the money could be spent on improving returns to investors through dividends or share buybacks.

Mr Haji-Ioannou is seeking to replace easyJet’s ageing fleet of A319s, which constitute about three quarters of the carrier’s fleet, with cost-effective and fuel-efficient 180-seat jetliners.

easyJet started operations in 1995 with Boeing aircraft; however, the airline shifted to Airbus airliners in 2002 when it placed an order for 120 A319s with options for a further 120 jets.

TOULOUSE, France--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- A comprehensive package of Rockwell Collins' information management, communication, navigation, electromechanical and avionics data network systems played a key role in the successful first flight of the Airbus A350 XWB. The flight occurred today in Toulouse, France.

""Watching the first flight of the A350 XWB is a gratifying and monumental occasion for our teams in the U.S. and Europe,"" said Kent Statler, executive vice president and chief operating officer, Commercial Systems for Rockwell Collins. ""This platform is especially important to our company since we've been given the opportunity to lead integration activities that introduce a new level of trust between Rockwell Collins and Airbus.""





Rockwell Collins provides the following systems as standard fit for the A350 XWB:

Information Management On-board

This solution is a new airborne hosting platform for flight operations, aircraft maintenance and airline applications. Monitoring all the systems of the aircraft, it assists maintenance crews by providing secure, detailed information and trends on the health of each component. In addition, it hosts data to the electronic flight bag, helping pilots get easy and instant access to flight plans, aircraft manuals and maps.

Communication System

This system ensures the management of voice and data communications of the aircraft, between pilots, flight crew, controllers and the airline company. It represents the consolidation of five separate packages into one, and encompasses full system integration responsibilities. The package includes next-generation capabilities with improved size, weight and power.

Landing and Navigation Systems

Airbus selected the Rockwell Collins Multi-Mode Receiver and Digital Low Range Altimeter, confirming Rockwell Collins' leadership in flight landing avionics. The Multi-Mode Receiver provides Instrument Landing System and GPS Landing System capabilities and Space Based Augmentation System, as well as the aircraft's position, velocity and time reference. It implements the latest satellite navigation features and is prepared for future airspace requirements such as Galileo.

Story continues

The Digital Radio Altimeter provides precise height measurements above terrain during aircraft approach, landing and climb-out phases of flight. This information is provided to the automatic flight control system, instrument system and terrain awareness and warning system. The Rockwell Collins Digital Low Range Altimeter is the first digital radio altimeter for commercial aircraft.

Rockwell Collins is also providing navigation system components consisting of the ADF-900 Automatic Direction Finder, DME-2100 Distance Measuring Equipment and the VOR-900 VHF Omnidirectional Radio receiver.

Trimmable Horizontal Stabilizer Actuator (THSA)

Rockwell Collins brings decades of experience designing, certifying and manufacturing its market-leading THSA to the A350 XWB. The flight-critical control system is built to withstand no-command-motion and load-path failures, and utilizes multiple electric drive motors for redundancy and maximum availability.

Rudder/Brake Pedal Assembly

As a longer term improvement of the A350 XWB aircraft, Airbus selected Rockwell Collins for the rudder/brake pedal assembly, which is part of the pilot control system. This unit leverages industry-leading applications and multiple generations of design experience in fly-by-wire pilot control systems. The rudder/brake pedal unit converts pilot inputs into an electrical signal that commands rudder movement, and it also controls the A350 XWB's main wheel braking system.

Avionics Data Network

This secure AFDX network represents the backbone of flight avionics data communications. It connects all the aircraft systems and applications. Rockwell Collins is the exclusive supplier of this critical data network on the Airbus A350 XWB, A380 and A400M. Rockwell Collins is also providing navigation system components including the Automatic Direction Finder (ADF-900), Distance Measuring Equipment (DME-2100) and the VHF Omnidirectional Radio receiver (VOR-900).

The A350 XWB (Xtra Wide-Body) is an all-new mid-size long range product line seating between 270 and 350 passengers in typical three-class layouts.

Flying on a Special Fiji Airways A330 Media Flight - Airline Reporter,"Thu, 06 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMy8wNi9mbHlpbmctb24tYS1zcGVjaWFsLWZpamktYWlyd2F5cy1hMzMwLW1lZGlhLWZsaWdodC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A media flight is always a special event, but there are a few things that can make it even more special. So how special is a media flight that also happens to be a delivery flight flown by two Airbus “expert pilots” who preformed a 2 hour low altitude fly by with the airline CEO on board as well as the artist responsible for the airlines brand new image? Yea, that is special. What else could Air Pacific, soon to be Fiji Airways, possibly have added to this flight to make it more special? I can’t think of anything. This is the story of a small airline that made a big impression.

Air Pacific is re-branding in a big way, which I detailed in a review of their new Airbus A330. To help promote these big changes, Fiji Airways in cooperation with Tourism Fiji invited a small handful of travel bloggers and journalists, as well as one #AvGeek (me), to fly out to Fiji and witness the delivery ceremonies of their second new Airbus A330.

The night before the flight, Fiji Airways took a large group of travel industry professionals from the Los Angeles area to tour the new aircraft, as they are the people responsible for filling it up with passengers. Fiji Airways is run by smart people and they know that the best way for travel agents to communicate to potential passengers about the nice new aircraft is simply to invite them on board.

The media group was given the first tour, lead by Fiji Airways acting CEO Aubrey Swift, who knew the airplane inside and out. Sadly, we had to leave the aircraft for the night, but we were able to return the next morning for our flight to Fiji.

Bright and early at the Tom Bradley International Terminal at LAX, all of about 30 passengers checked in for the media flight and we took the long walk down to the remote bus gate. I had never boarded like this at LAX before and I’m not sure many people do. We ended up at some concrete ramp of a gate once off the bus, where Namuka-I-Lau, our A330, was waiting for us to board.

The boarding process and subsequent procedures were very standard, which was not what I was expecting for a media flight. We had to push back on time, and after a quick safety briefing, that is exactly what we did. So long, LAX. Hello, 14 hour journey.

Soon after take off, we were served a delicious (but special media flight) breakfast, it was time to explore the aircraft a bit. I had just recently been on a delivery flight a few weeks before, but that flight was packed compared to this one. With only about 35 passengers on board, it was exciting to see so many empty seats, as it meant I could explore the aircraft without bothering anyone else.

The flight was long, and most people on board decided to sleep for a few hours. I, however, had other plans. There was a good amount of light bleeding through the front galley curtains, and I needed to know why. Passing through the curtains, I discovered that the door to the flight deck was open and I quickly asked if I could have a look inside.

Not only did I have a look, but I sat on the jump seat for a solid hour, talking with Fiji Airways Chief Pilot, as well as the two Airbus pilots. Captain Yann Lardet, who holds the official title of “Flight Operations Expert Pilot,” showed me many details of the A330 flight deck, which I never would have known about otherwise.

Watching as Captain Lardet requested an increase in cruising altitude by means of digital communications only was quite interesting. No audible communication was necessary to request the change in altitude.

During my time spent in the flight deck, I inquired about a map that was on the center console and I received the best answer ever. The long, winding, amazing flight plan I spotted turned out to be the plan for our 2 hour, low altitude fly over of the Fiji islands.

When I asked more about the fly over, the pilots were concerned about the weather in Fiji, and that if visibility was too low, it would have to be scrapped. Thankfully, the weather cleared, and our epic two hour tour of Fiji began.

As the fly over began, the travel writers asked me if I had ever been on a fly over like this before, to which I responded with a grin, and a comment along the lines of “hahaha….no.” We dipped down to altitudes as low as 900 feet, banking and turning over the mountainous outer islands of Fiji. The Pacific Ocean zipped by below, as did entire towns and groups of trees.

We would bank heavily to the left, only for moments before the engines roared and we banked hard to the right, creating stunning views out the windows. Our “expert pilots” put the A330 to the test, and it was one hell of a ride…something I am not likely to ever be a part of again. There are no words that can properly describe how awesome this was.

Although this was the airline’s second of three new Airbus A330s, it was every bit as important as the first to the airline and people of Fiji. As a part of Fiji tradition, the pilots quickly made their way down the air stairs, where they were mobbed by a group of women and cloaked in robes. That’s one hell of a welcome!

This media flight was one that I will never forget,as I was able to cross a lot of “firsts” off my list. My first true delivery flight, my first low-altitude fly over, my first time spending a significant amount of time in a flight deck while in-flight. Every minute of this flight was simply amazing, one to remember forever.

Soon I will be sharing my experiences on the ground in Fiji.

'Least safe' aircraft models revealed - Telegraph - The Telegraph,"Wed, 19 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay90cmF2ZWwvbmV3cy9MZWFzdC1zYWZlLWFpcmNyYWZ0LW1vZGVscy1yZXZlYWxlZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The website AirlineRatings.com urged travellers to steer clear of four models in particular - the LET410, the Antonov AN-12, the Ilyushin Il-76, and the CASA C-212.

The LET410, for example, has been involved in at least 20 fatal crashes since 2003, according to its research, while the Ilyushin Il-76 and the Antonov AN-12 have each been involved in 17.

The LET410 – introduced in 1970 – is still used by around a dozen airlines, including four in Brazil, three in Honduras, two in the Philippines, two in Russia, and two in Hungary. Citywing, based in the Isle of Man, also uses four LET410s, leased from the Czech carrier Van Air Europe.

The Antonov AN-12 is currently used by Egyptair, Iraqi Airways, and Russia's Aeroflot, among others.

A handful of airlines count the CASA C-212 among their fleet, including Bering Air and Bighorn Airways in the US, while the Ilyushin Il-76 is now largely used for transporting cargo.

Of the 55 models analysed by AirlineRatings.com, the safest were deemed to be Boeing’s 777, 717, 787 and 767/757, the Airbus A380 and A340, the Embraer 135/145, and CRJ 700/1000 – none of which have ever been involved in a fatal accident.

“The crash records of aircraft that dominated the 1970s and 1980s but are no longer in passenger service are irrelevant today,” said Geoffrey Thomas, editor of Airline-Rating.com. “We only looked at aircraft that are carrying passengers in 2013.""

He added: “We have used the Boeing database which is an industry standard and supplemented that with our own records and those of Aviation-Safety.net and Ascend. The survey also ignores piston-powered planes and those smaller aircraft used mainly for charter work.”

Last week the website ranked 425 different airlines in terms of overall safety using a star system. One-star airlines, it claimed, were the least reliable.

A total of 137 airlines have been given seven stars, the top mark, including British Airways, Flybe, Virgin Atlantic, Lufthansa and Aer Lingus. Ryanair, easyJet, Monarch and Jet2.com were each given five stars.

More than 40 airlines were given three stars or fewer, including Lion Air based in Indonesia, Yeti Airlines in Nepal, and Solomon Airlines.

"Airbus Bag2Go smart luggage packs mobile radio, GPS and RFID - TechSpot","Fri, 07 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9uZXdzLzUyODM0LWFpcmJ1cy1iYWcyZ28tc21hcnQtbHVnZ2FnZS1wYWNrcy1tb2JpbGUtcmFkaW8tZ3BzLWFuZC1yZmlkLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Lost luggage could soon be a thing of the past. Well, let me take that back - finding your luggage that the airline lost could soon become much easier if a prototype smart luggage reaches production status. Airbus' Bag2Go luggage is equipped with numerous sensors that can be used to track your luggage as you travel.

Specifically, the luggage contains a GPS tracking device, a 2G mobile chip and an RFID chip. These connectivity elements could be used in conjunction with an iPhone app (we assume Android would be supported as well) and handling systems in an airport to keep track of your checked baggage at all times.

The case is able to alert the owner when it has been opened, either by TSA security workers or perhaps the prying eyes of someone else. The luggage even comes with a scale built into the handle to allow users to weigh it before getting to the airport.

Airbus reportedly worked with German luggage maker Rimowa and T-Mobile to create the prototype. The difference between Airbus' implementation and other luggage tracking accessories is that tracking hardware for the Airbus luggage is built right into the case.

Unfortunately Airbus doesn't have any plans to sell the luggage directly. Instead, they may license the technology to airlines which could then rent the suitcases out to passengers when they travel. Another option would see Airbus use the technology as part of a door-to-door service. Under this idea, the company would pick up the luggage from a traveler's home, take it to the airport and see that it arrives at their destination."
Video: Composite-Rich Airbus 350 Makes First Flight - Design News,"Fri, 21 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc2lnbm5ld3MuY29tL2Fzc2VtYmx5L3ZpZGVvLWNvbXBvc2l0ZS1yaWNoLWFpcmJ1cy0zNTAtbWFrZXMtZmlyc3QtZmxpZ2h00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A350 XWB, composed of more than 50 percent carbon composites, took off on its successful maiden flight last week. A precise and smooth takeoff and landing over Paris's Toulouse-Blaganc airport bookended the flight, which lasted about four hours.

A lot of ground testing went into the preparation for this event, since Airbus had previously said it expected first flight tests to occur toward the end of summer. This ground testing included powering up the MSN001 flight test version's two Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines on June 2, which had been installed in the aircraft in March. Before that powerup, Airbus conducted final outdoor ground tests, and other tests such as flight-test-instrumentation verification. In December 2012, the aircraft maker completed indoor ground tests, including stability tests on movable elements such as ailerons, wing spoilers, elevators, and rudder, and tests to ensure extraction and retraction of landing gears.

The MSN001 is the first structurally complete A350 XWB. The plane incorporates more than 53 percent carbon-fiber-reinforced composites by weight, the largest proportion of any commercial jet so far. As we've previously reported, carbon fiber composites are used in the fuselage panels and barrel, the vertical and horizontal tail plane, the wings' upper and lower covers, the wing spars and center wing box, the plane's keel beam, and the main landing gear door and bay.

Both the structural design and aerodynamics of the A350 XWB's wings are expected to contribute considerably to the plane's targeted reduction of 25 percent in fuel consumption. At 32 meters x 6 meters each, they are the biggest civil aircraft components to date to be made from carbon-fiber-reinforced composite. Composite leader Hexcel is supplying most of the plane's carbon fiber composites, both prepreg and fibers, used in its primary structures.

A key issue for planes made with substantial amounts of carbon-fiber-reinforced composites is the danger of lightning strikes. To avoid this, Airbus embedded metallic foils into the aircraft's carbon composite panels, which increases the electrical conductivity of the plane's structures and protects its harnesses with metallic conduits. This design ensures adequate protection for both systems and equipment. Airbus successfully completed electromagnetic hazard testing in April on a second flight test aircraft, the A350 XWB MSN3.

Airbus's A350 XWB is designed to combine widebody passenger comfort with twin engines, instead of the three or four engines required on other widebody jet designs. It will be made in three versions that seat between 270 and 350 passengers each. The plane is scheduled to enter service in the second half of 2014 after flight testing is completed, which will comprise about 2,500 flight hours by five A350 aircraft.
