Airbus and SAS Scandinavian Airlines sign hybrid and electric aircraft research agreement - Airbus,"Wed, 22 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wNS1haXJidXMtYW5kLXNhcy1zY2FuZGluYXZpYW4tYWlybGluZXMtc2lnbi1oeWJyaWQtYW5kLWVsZWN0cmlj0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse – Airbus has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with SAS Scandinavian Airlines for hybrid and electric aircraft eco-system and infrastructure requirements research.



The MoU was signed by Grazia Vittadini, Chief Technology Officer, Airbus and Göran Jansson, Deputy President EVP Strategy & Ventures, Scandinavian Airlines. Collaboration will start in June 2019 and will continue until the end of 2020.

Under the MoU, Airbus and SAS Scandinavian Airlines will cooperate on a joint research project to enhance understanding of the operational and infrastructure opportunities and challenges involved with the large-scale introduction of hybrid and full electric aircraft to airlines modus operandi. The project scope includes five work packages, which focus on analysing the impact of ground infrastructure and charging on range, resources, time and availability at airports.

The collaboration also includes a plan to involve a renewable energy supplier to ensure genuine zero CO2 emissions operations are assessed. This multidisciplinary approach—from energy to infrastructure—aims to address the entire aircraft operations ecosystem in order to better support the aviation industry's transition to sustainable energy.

Aircraft are roughly 80% more fuel efficient per passenger kilometer than they were 50 years ago. However, with air traffic growth estimated to more than double over the next 20 years, reducing aviation’s impact on the environment remains the aim of the industry.

To overcome this challenge, the Global Aviation Industry (ATAG) including Airbus and SAS Scandinavian Airlines have committed to achieving carbon-neutral growth for the aviation industry as a whole from 2020 onwards, cutting aviation net emissions by 50% by 2050 (compared to 2005).

This agreement further strengthens Airbus’ position in a field where it is already investing in and focusing its research efforts on developing hybrid-electric and electric propulsion technologies that promise significant environmental benefits. Airbus has already started to build a portfolio of technology demonstrators and is currently testing innovative hybrid propulsion systems, subsystems and components in order to address long-term efficiency goals for building and operating electric aircraft.

Airbus introduces workforce development programs for Mobile students | Made in Alabama - Made In Alabama,"Wed, 08 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hZGVpbmFsYWJhbWEuY29tLzIwMTkvMDUvYWlyYnVzLWludHJvZHVjZXMtd29ya2ZvcmNlLWRldmVsb3BtZW50LXByb2dyYW1zLWZvci1tb2JpbGUtc3R1ZGVudHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“The ideal candidate for FlightPath9 is that student with an aptitude for working with his or her hands, and an interest in working in the aviation industry right out of high school,” said Daryl Taylor, vice president and general manager of the Airbus A320 Manufacturing Facility in Mobile.

“They must be willing and able to participate in a nine-month program, be drug-free, can read, write, do math, be 18 years or older by June 2020, and can adhere to “soft” work skills: show up to work every day and on time, can work in a team with respect for all co-workers, be dedicated, driven and determined.

“Give us that, and we’ll give you a chance at a career,” Taylor added.

For this program, Flight Works Alabama has partnered with Airbus, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU), Cintas, Snap-On Tools, Southwest Alabama Partnership for Training & Employment, and the National Coalition of Certification Centers (NC3).

The nine-month comprehensive learning program involves NC3 Snap-on certifications, ERAU instruction, guest speakers, success coaches and more. The students will attend training after school during their senior year of high school.

FAST TRACK PROGRAM

The students who successfully complete this program have the opportunity to start their career with Airbus through the second program announced today: Fast Track.

Fast Track is a 12- to 15-week program that will bring individuals lacking aviation manufacturing experience into the company and give them the skills, knowledge and ability required for an aerospace maintenance career.

Like FlightPath9, ideal candidates for Fast Track must exhibit an aptitude for working with their hands and an interest in working in the aviation industry. They must be drug-free, able to read, write, do basic math, be at least 18 years old, and able to exhibit job experience and the needed “soft skills.”

“In turn, we’ll teach and measure these employees in a program of global competencies for working on aircraft: torqueing, riveting, gauging, reading blueprints (written and digital), how to use tools, ergonomics, and more,” said Taylor.

“When they come out of that training, the employee ‘graduates’ to on-the-job training on A220 and A320 aircraft.”

ALABAMA PRODUCTION HUB

Airbus began producing A320 Family aircraft at its $600 million manufacturing facility in Alabama in 2015 and has since delivered more than 100 passenger jets to its customers in Mobile.

Earlier this year, Airbus broke ground on a second assembly line at the Mobile campus for the production of A220 aircraft. The $264 million project will create more than 430 jobs.

A220 production is expected to start on the current assembly line in the third quarter, with first delivery of a Mobile-assembled A220 aircraft scheduled for 2020. The new A220 production facilities will be complete by next year. S

Working in partnership with AIDT, Alabama’s primary workforce development agency, Airbus has already begun hiring new workers for A220 production.

Starting positions are electrical or structural assemblers, and corrosion team. The jobs are listed on the Airbus ApplicantPro career site with a planned early-June start date for the first class.

People who have applied for these positions in the past and been turned down only due to lack of experience are encouraged to reapply. Airbus intends to offer this program on a regular basis and will schedule it as hiring needs dictate.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997709393501282}",neutral,0.9997709393501282,0

Delivery of the 9000th nacelle for the V2500

Continued support for the A220 nacelle program ramp-up

FOLEY, ALABAMA (MAY, 30, 2019) – Today Collins Aerospace Systems celebrated its 45-year relationship with Airbus by delivering the 1,000th nacelle for the A320neo program, delivering the 9000th V2500 nacelle, and continuing to support the ramp-up of the A220 nacelle program. These milestones were commemorated at a ceremony hosted by Collins Aerospace at its Foley, Alabama facility. More than 900 employees at the facility were joined by leaders from Airbus in the U.S., as well as Alabama Congressman Bradley Byrne, to mark the milestones. Collins Aerospace is a unit of United Technologies Corp. (NYS: UTX).

The relationship with Airbus dates back to the A300, the first Airbus aircraft. The milestones achieved are due to the strong collaboration and hard work from both companies.

“This celebration and the work we do with Airbus goes far beyond Foley today. Teams across our worldwide sites are working with pride and commitment to provide on-time delivery and quality, and ensure that our relationship with Airbus remains strong for years to come,” said Jim Pollock, Collins Aerospace Vice President of Airbus Programs. “We’re now integrating A320neo engines with our advanced nacelle systems on three continents and continuing to introduce new manufacturing innovations -- such as robotic painting systems and advanced fastening tools -- to meet the increasing global demand for air travel.”

In support of the Airbus A320neo program, Collins has invested hundreds of millions of dollars to expand manufacturing capacity at six global sites.

Collins Aerospace’s innovative nacelle system for the Airbus A320neo is performing with 99.99% percent dispatch reliability. There are currently more than 750 Collins nacelles operating on A320neo aircraft with 32 airlines.

“In more than a million fleet hours since the A320neo’s entry into service, there have been less than 10 delays and zero cancellations associated with the Collins nacelle,” said Pollock. “This type of reliability is a testament to the commitment and dedication of the program, engineering, and airline support teams.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999641180038452}",positive,0.9999641180038452,1
"America ruled commercial aviation, but then came Airbus - CNET","Wed, 29 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvdGVjaC1pbmR1c3RyeS9hbWVyaWNhLXJ1bGVkLWNvbW1lcmNpYWwtYXZpYXRpb24tYnV0LXRoZW4tY2FtZS1haXJidXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"During the earliest days of the commercial jet age in the 1960s, the global aviation market was dominated by two American companies: Boeing and Douglas Aircraft (later McDonnell Douglas). Airliners like the Boeing 707 and the Douglas DC-8 rocketed between continents, making the world smaller and allowing people to fly who had never done so before.

Air France's first A300 flight was from Paris to London. Airbus

But as the decade closed, just as the massive Boeing 747 first took to the skies, Europe wanted in. Though France, the UK and the Netherlands were building their own jets like the elegant Caravelle and the mighty VC-10, most European airliners were still buying American planes.

Realizing that they needed to combine resources if they were to compete, several British, French and German companies, including the two firms that built the Concorde, formed Airbus 50 years ago Wednesday, May 29. And almost five years later on May 23, 1974, its first aircraft, the Airbus A300, entered service with Air France.

Europe strikes back

When it first flew in 1972, the A300 was designed to compete squarely with the Douglas DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011. Also a wide-body aircraft, it could carry a similar passenger load (around 266) on short- and medium-range routes within Europe. But unlike its trijet American rivals, the A300 had only two General Electric CF6 engines, making it cheaper to operate.

Like all subsequent Airbus planes, sections of the A300 were produced throughout Europe and ferried to the company's final assembly plant in the southwestern French city of Toulouse. Though eventually entire A300 sections would be transported in Super Guppy freight aircraft, the prototype aircraft was driven to the factory in a convoy through tiny French villages. It was an unusual scene that would become a normal occurrence when Airbus started building the A380 in 2007.

Watch this: On the road with an Airbus A380 01:06

After an initial burst of sales in Europe and Asia, A300 sales slowed in the mid-1970s. Airbus even took the plane on a world tour to promote it to airlines. But the A300 got a break in 1978 when Eastern Airlines became the first US customer with an order for 23 planes. Pan Am followed the same year, giving Airbus a foothold in a critical market.

That initial success went on to birth an Airbus family. A shortened version of the A300, called the A310, flew in 1982. Airbus later adapted the A300 into the BelugaST transport aircraft. Later, in the 1990s, it also adopted the longer range A330 and A340 into the BelugaST. (The giant double-decker A380 is another beast, literally, altogether.)

For its Golden Anniversary today, current Airbus planes joined France's Patrouille de France aerobatic demonstration team for a formation flight. Airbus

The A300 also changed as it progressed. Initially it had a three person flight crew -- pilot, co-pilot and engineer -- but later versions eliminated the flight engineer position. Also, while A300 pilots used control columns to fly the plane, Airbus cockpits later adopted sidesticks for control starting with the short-range A320 in 1987.

Today the A300 is out of production and though most passenger versions have left service, FedEx and UPS still operate fleets of the successful A300 freighter. An A300 also flies with the European Space Agency as a zero gravity training aircraft. But the A300's biggest legacy is Airbus' success as an airplane manufacturer. Because now its Boeing, which absorbed McDonnell Douglas in 1997, and Airbus that are locked in a fierce rivalry. (But that didn't stop Boeing today from wishing Airbus ""Happy Birthday."")

It took time, but Europe definitely caught up.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999983310699463}",neutral,0.9999983310699463,0
Five things Airbus got right and five it didn't - Flightglobal,"Tue, 28 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWF0LTUwL2ZpdmUtdGhpbmdzLWFpcmJ1cy1nb3QtcmlnaHQtYW5kLWZpdmUtaXQtZGlkbnQvMTMyMzE1LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Over its 50-year history, Airbus has led the way in a number of major technological and industrial innovations and contributions to the industry. Here, we list five of the most important, together with five products or business moves that – with the glorious benefit of hindsight – failed to live up to billing.

TRIUMPHS

1. FIRST WIDEBODY TWINJET

A300 provided the solid foundation needed to propel the airframer’s twin-aisle and later A320 programmes

Airbus

The reason the consortium was created in 1969 was to bring to market the A300. It was the world’s first twin-aisle, twin-engined airliner, a novel concept in an era that had just seen the introduction of the first twin-aisle types: the four-engine Boeing 747 and the Lockheed L-1011 and McDonnell Douglas DC-10 trijets. While the A300B, which first flew in 1972, and its followers, the A300-600 and A310, could not compete in the long-haul market with these US types, their capacity and reliability made them strong-sellers in the short- and medium-haul market. After a slow start, the family eventually notched up sales of 820 aircraft, and became a popular choice as a freighter. As the world of aviation went through tumultuous change in the 1970s, the rather utilitarian “Air bus” could never vie with the likes of the Concorde and Jumbo Jet in the glamour stakes. However, its design – engineering chiefs calculated that a 5.54m (222in) diameter fuselage was optimal for a 200- to 300-seat aircraft and it remains the basic cross-section of the A330neo – ensured it delivered the sort of economies airlines were seeking. It also gave Airbus the solid foundation it needed to go on to develop its most successful design, the A320 family, in the 1980s.

2. FLY-BY-WIRE

Sidestick control replaced traditional columns

Max Kingsley-Jones/FlightGlobal

Arguably, Airbus’s biggest and boldest technological breakthrough – other than the launch of the world’s first widebody twin – was the implementation of fly-by-wire cockpit technology. Airbus had introduced electrical signalling on secondary flight controls on the A300 and A310, but Roger Beteille, one of the architects of Airbus’s success in its first two decades, wanted to take this further on the A320, with a digital system that would calculate the necessary control surface deflections needed to make the aircraft respond as the pilot wished. Its most revolutionary feature was a sidestick control in place of the traditional control column. As well as improving flight controls, the technology helped reduce weight, and introduced flight envelope protection, preventing the pilots from performing manoeuvres outside the aircraft’s performance limits. Fly-by-wire also established the idea of the common cockpit, allowing aircraft to be flown the same way regardless of its size or weight – a huge boon for airlines seeking to cut the training costs of moving pilots from one type to another. Airbus did not invent fly-by-wire: versions had featured on several earlier types, including the Concorde. However, with the A320, it brought the technology to the mass market.

3. COMPOSITES

Pioneer of using aircraft composites including carbonfibre material

Airbus

Boeing may have made a giant leap in terms of composites with the all-plastic 787, but more than three decades earlier, Airbus had pioneered non-metallic structures. The A300 featured the first use of composite materials in any passenger aircraft, with the leading and trailing edges of the tail fin composed of glass-fibre reinforced plastic. Airbus extended their deployment in the A310 into the engine pylons and other parts of the tail. Airbus’s Spanish partner CASA was the driver behind the technology, and its use has continued on every successive Airbus programme, with composite materials making up just over half the structural weight of the A350.

4. DISPERSED PRODUCTION

Production spread across partner countries boosted the consortium’s ability to take on the USA

Airbus

It was partly a result of political expediency – in the early days, the partner states allocated each country’s industry “workshare” according to its stake in the business – but the four-nation structure of the consortium gave Airbus an advantage over its transatlantic competitors. Rather than having one largely vertically integrated organisation, Airbus created “centres of excellence” based largely on traditional areas of expertise, with the UK, for instance, responsible for wings, Germany for sections of the fuselage, and Spain for composite materials, particularly on the tail. It could be argued (see failures) that internal, national competition, and politically influenced compromises such as the decision to have the A380 final assembly line in Toulouse and cabin completions in Hamburg, led to more inefficiencies than streamlined processes. However, pooling Europe’s aerospace expertise created an organisation much better equipped to take on the USA than the sum of its parts, and the dispersed production set-up has survived 50 years.

5. FIRST PAN-NATIONAL AEROSPACE ORGANISATION

Cross-border co-operation proved effective

Airbus

While aircraft manufacturers had worked with overseas partners and licensed aircraft designs across borders almost since the Wright Brothers, European industry in the 1960s was still a jealously protected national activity, on both the military and commercial front. After the war, the UK and France had launched programmes such as the BAC One-Eleven, de Havilland Comet, Hawker Siddeley Trident, and the Sud Aviation Caravelle with mixed success, while a reconstructed West Germany, now very much part of the anti-Soviet Western alliance, was seeking a route back into the industry after the devastation of 1945. The early to mid-1960s saw collaborations on the military side with the Anglo-French Sepecat Jaguar and Concorde in the commercial segment, but the steps to create Airbus took co-operation to a new level. While the Airbus of 1969 was far from the single entity it was eventually to become in the 2010s, the consortium was something entirely new in aerospace.

DISAPPOINTMENTS

1. THE A380 AND 21ST CENTURY WIDEBODY STRATEGY

Airbus pursued “4 engines 4 long haul” strategy despite increasing competition from the very capable 777 twinjet

Airbus

When the A380 wove almost silently and gracefully over the 2006 Paris air show, there was a feeling of awe among spectators similar to that which greeted the arrival of the 747 almost four decades earlier. The company that had created the first widebody twinjet had built the world’s largest airliner, a type it vowed would make long-haul aviation more efficient by allowing carriers to transport more than 500 passengers between hub airports, and put the hugely successful current jumbo of the skies, the 747, out of the passenger business. It was not to be. With Emirates the only real convert among the world’s leading airlines, Airbus announced in February this year that it was ending the programme in 2021 after just 234 deliveries and a handful still to be handed over to the Dubai carrier. We can see the A380 debacle as part of a very inconsistent performance over the years in the widebody market from Airbus. There have been successes – the A300/310, the A330 and earlier versions of the A340, while the jury is still out on the long-term impact of the A350. However, Airbus also got it badly wrong with the original A350 – a warmed over A330 that it quickly replaced with the A350 XWB – and its expensive bet on the appeal of quadjets in the 2000s. It was promoting the A380 and A340-600 as the solution to the industry’s long-haul large-cabin needs at a time when airlines were more concerned about fuel prices than the assurance of four engines on transoceanic routes. It cleared the way for Boeing to dominate that segment with the 777-300ER, after the airframer and GE Aviation managed to create a large twinjet with the necessary thrust to achieve the range required, leaving Airbus to play catch up.

2.VARIANTS TOO FAR

Smallest A320 variant failed to make the grade

Airbus

While the A340-600 failed to match the success of the 1990s versions of the quadjet – at one point in the mid-2000s, the 777 was outselling its European competitor by 10 to one – the soon-to-be-abandoned stretch was not Airbus’s only family-addition flop of the decade. The double-shrink A318 followed attempts to develop a 100-seat derivative of the A320 with the Chinese, dubbed the AE31X, but the airliner – initially offered only with the Pratt & Whitney PW6000 – was widely regarded as too thirsty to be a short-hop commuter jet, and too small to be economic on longer routes. Airbus delivered 80 A318s in total, including 20 as corporate jets. The one consolation for Airbus is that the smallest version of the 737NG, the 737-600, fared no better.

3. GLARE PANELS

Use of the material unlikely to extend beyond A380

Airbus

Glare – or glass-fibre reinforced aluminium – is one of the best-known technological innovations on the A380. Used for much of the superjumbo’s upper fuselage skins, the hybrid material was developed by Delft University in the Netherlands and is manufactured by GKN unit Fokker Aerospace. The versatile product, a sandwich of aluminium sheets and glass-fibre bond film, is drilled and milled like metal, and panels can vary in thickness according to need. According to Airbus, it offers up to 30% savings over aluminium, together with impressive anti-corrosion properties. However, despite Glare winning a number of industry accolades, Airbus decided against using the material on the A350 – roughly half of which is constructed from composites – and the technology is unlikely to survive in use beyond the A380.

4. POWER STRUGGLES

Two heads did not work better than one

We have listed dispersed production and Airbus’s pan-national structure as strengths. However, as Airbus’s output grew and programme management became more complex, the challenges of maintaining this complicated, cross-border set up came to a head in 2006 during the final stages of the A380’s development. Lack of visibility between production lines in Hamburg and Toulouse – each responsible for a fuselage section of the superjumbo – meant two incompatible sets of wiring harnesses were designed. Short-lived Airbus chief executive Christian Streiff explained in an interview the same year that an obsession with balancing power and positions between French and German interests was a reason behind his departure. “This formula could be efficient during a normal time,” he told Le Figaro. “But it is no longer appropriate for a company that is going through a serious crisis.” The parent EADS board took heed, setting in chain a process that saw the company replace the dual-leadership structure with a single chief executive – first Louis Gallois in 2007 and then Tom Enders in 2012 – followed by the umbrella organisation’s rebranding to Airbus Group in 2014, and then just Airbus (with the former airliner arm referred to as “Airbus commercial”). Although Enders’ proposed 2012 merger with BAE Systems failed, the recently-retired German will be remembered as the executive who turned EADS/Airbus into a single company run purely on commercial rather than political or national lines.

5. FREIGHTERS

Despite some passenger-tofreighter success, airframer falls behind rival in cargo market

Airbus

Airbus’s first widebody proved itself worthy in the cargo market, as has the A330-200 – both as a new-build and passenger-to-freighter conversion. The A330-derived Beluga, used by Airbus to transport aircraft sections between assembly lines in France, Germany and the UK, is arguably the most distinctive freighter aircraft in the world. However, the airframer’s overall record in the freighter segment has been patchy compared with its rival, which has many hundreds of 777s, 767s and 747s in service with cargo operators. Airbus has never seriously offered the A350 as a freighter, and it cancelled the A380F before any deliveries, forfeiting orders from UPS and FedEx.

Airbus eyes opportunities in future U.S. military LEO constellations - SpaceNews,"Mon, 06 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXJidXMtZXllcy1vcHBvcnR1bml0aWVzLWluLWZ1dHVyZS11LXMtbWlsaXRhcnktbGVvLWNvbnN0ZWxsYXRpb25zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — The first project of the newly created Space Development Agency will be to design a large constellation of commercially produced satellites in low Earth orbit to serve as a communications layer and take over military space missions ranging from missile tracking to navigation.

Airbus is preparing to start cranking out 32 satellites every three weeks for the broadband venture OneWeb. It built an assembly line on Florida’s Space Coast to manufacture up to 648 satellites for OneWeb but also hopes to ramp production to fill orders for the Defense Department, intelligence community and other U.S. government buyers, Nicolas Chamussy, the outgoing head of Airbus Space Systems told SpaceNews on Monday at the Satellite 2019 conference.

The company received a $2.9 million contract last fall from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to produce satellite buses for DARPA’s Blackjack program, an experiment intended to show the military utility of LEO constellations and mesh networks. DARPA will marry up commercial satellite buses with military sensors and payloads. Former DARPA official Fred Kennedy conceived the Blackjack project and is now head of the Space Development Agency. He said the SDA will tap into the commercial industry’s mass satellite production capabilities in order to build a military constellation in LEO.

Airbus’ main satellite manufacturing plant is in Toulouse, France. It now has U.S.-based design teams staffed with U.S. citizens as well as the Florida production facility, Chamussy said. “It’s an opportunity for the U.S. government” to take advantage of these capabilities, he said. The U.S. plant only builds commercial satellites but it could be expanded to produce classified spacecraft, he said.

The contract with DARPA has been valuable to Airbus to learn about U.S. defense programs and as a stepping stone to possibly other projects, Chamussy said. “With DARPA, we are learning how to work together, we are trying to understand if our platform is a valuable asset for the U.S. government.”

The company is focused now on making satellites and installing OneWeb payloads, but “we can install whatever you want,” he said. For the military, the same satellites could carry positioning, navigation and timing (PNT), electronic warfare, Earth observation or weather payloads. “This is the beauty of have a design team and dedicated facility in U.S.,” said Chamussy.

Airbus is hoping to be chosen as the satellite supplier to Canadian satellite operator Telesat, which also received a DARPA Blackjack contract to study the use of commercial buses in LEO-based military systems.

Airbus is competing against a Maxar Technologies-Thales Alenia Space team for a contract worth an estimated $3 billion to build Telesat’s megaconstellation. Chamussy told reporters at a news conference on Monday that the company expects to submit a proposal in the coming months. “We are still waiting for the request for proposals,” he said.

Chamussy insisted that the Telesat concept is very different than OneWeb because the Canadian operator is asking for a full “end to end” system that includes not just the satellites but also ground systems and managed services.

Airbus announced last month that Chamussy will be stepping down as executive vice president of Airbus Space Systems under Airbus Defence and Space. He will be replaced by Airbus Defence and Space executive Jean-Marc Nasr. Chamussy declined to comment on whether he will stay at Airbus or in what capacity.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999995231628418}",neutral,0.999995231628418,0

Toulouse, France — Silicon Valley has fetishized disruption. It is the holy grail of the 21st century business model to upset the apple cart. It gleefully throws a wrench into the gears of stagnant systems that haven’t been required to evolve. Uber and Lyft have indisputably disrupted how we move on the ground, but both have done so while losing untold sums of money and an unclear path to future profit. Disruption is expensive.

Embedded in the Airbus strategy for the A321neo, the A321LR and the incoming A321XLR is a pitch for industry disruption through stability and its pathway to the next evolution of its business. As Airbus marks its 50th birthday, the company that started with a handshake between France and Germany at Le Bourget is continuing the same five decade long strategy that enabled its growth into half of a superduopoly.

Regardless of whether Airbus formally launches the A321XLR at the Paris Air Show next month, by 2023, Airbus will have introduced three A321neo siblings in six years alongside the A330neo in the nascent fight for the middle of the market. “All of that at a fraction, literally a fraction, of the cost of the development of a brand new program,” said Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer last week at the company’s annual Innovation Days forum.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.973991870880127}",negative,0.973991870880127,-1
Airbus innovation for military aircraft inspection and maintenance - Airbus,"Wed, 29 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE5LTA1LWFpcmJ1cy1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLWZvci1taWxpdGFyeS1haXJjcmFmdC1pbnNwZWN0aW9uLWFuZC1tYWludGVuYW5jZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A joint project is expected to significantly modernise the maintenance, repair and overhaul process of military aircraft

New technologies – including the use of drones, augmented reality and artificial intelligence – are coming together in an innovative Airbus system that offers the promise to revolutionise aircraft maintenance.

Called Drone and Augmented Reality inspections, the technology provides maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) operators with an end-to-end digital solution that facilitates the performance of tasks, while guaranteeing quality and adherence to airworthiness standards.

The Drone and Augmented Reality inspections services are being jointly developed by Airbus with a military service for inspections of Airbus-built A400M heavy-lift airlifters. Its application could be further extended to cover three other Airbus military airlifters: the medium-lift CN235 and C295 transports; along with A330 MRTTs (Multi Role Tanker Transports).



Reducing inspection time and creating a more robust maintenance, repair and overhaul process

Using drones equipped with high-definition cameras and a 3D augmented reality LIDAR (light imaging, detection and ranging sensor), the technology provides accurate positioning during the fly-around inspection, along with artificial intelligence for the detection of potential defects on the inspected aircraft – backed by the use of various devices such as smart glasses, tablets and team computers.

The use of Drone and Augmented Reality inspections will significantly reduce inspection time, while also lowering the risk of inadvertent damage caused by traditional inspection methods that require a build-up of scaffolding and the deployment of mobile equipment around the aircraft. As an example, a drone-based external inspection of a large aircraft such as the A400M (with an overall length of length of 45 metres) would take only two hours – while the same process requires weeks with traditional methods.



Applying artificial intelligence, and augmented/virtual reality

This technology also will play an important role in the next step: processing the drone-captured information and determining potential actions based on identified defects, discrepancies and damage that are discovered on the aircraft. Images and data are contextualised through a virtual aircraft model that uses mathematical logarithms (validated by quality inspectors). Artificial intelligence – more specifically, deep learning – increases the logarithms’ precision, creating a more robust and autonomous system. Augmented and virtual reality also help facilitate the decision-making process, cutting down on the execution time for maintenance tasks.

After completion of the work, another drone scan can be performed to check the quality and completeness of the tasks – confirming the aircraft’s ready-to-fly status and enabling the its handover to operators.

"With no Europe, who would have bet on Airbus? - Airbus","Tue, 21 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wNS13aXRoLW5vLWV1cm9wZS13aG8td291bGQtaGF2ZS1iZXQtb24tYWlyYnVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In 1969, European aerospace was in the doldrums. The sector’s once-illustrious names had faded and, competing against each other, lagged far behind the Americans, who commanded more than 80% of the market for commercial aircraft. Against this backdrop, on 29th May 1969, ministers from Germany and France agreed a new approach: a partnership between European nations, later joined by Spain and the UK, to develop the first Airbus aircraft, the twin-aisle A300.

Frankly, few people gave this pan-European venture much hope of success. Yet from that seed has flowered a global aerospace champion.

Ahead of this month’s European Parliament elections, the message must be heard that a strong and confident European Union is vital to Europe’s economic future amid populist nationalism, fragile growth and simmering trade tensions. It is certainly the lesson of Airbus’s past and present as the European aerospace manufacturer celebrates its 50th anniversary, also this month.

Airbus has been a triumph of European integration. Over five decades, we have brought together civil and defence aviation businesses from throughout the continent, reducing costs and duplication. Today, Airbus produces half of the world’s large commercial aircraft and has thriving helicopter, defence and space businesses. We employ 130,000 highly-skilled people globally and are a powerful engine of productivity, exports and innovation for Europe.

Ours has been a heady story of political co-operation, transatlantic rivalry and headline-grabbing sales coups, all underpinned by the quiet excellence of generations of engineers who have helped to make air travel safer, more fuel-efficient and accessible to hundreds of millions of new passengers all over the world.

Landmark innovations have propelled Airbus’s growth. Since 2014, our A350 aircraft, built with advanced lightweight composite materials, have reduced CO2 emissions on long-haul flights by 25% compared to many older jetliners. Our ability to move our parts, people and technology freely throughout Europe is at the heart of our business.

What’s next? The aerospace industry stands on the cusp of a technological revolution to match anything in its history. Digital technology, autonomous flight, artificial intelligence and electrification will transform the way aircraft are designed, manufactured, flown and maintained. It’s already being called aerospace’s new “golden age” and will herald tougher competition and the emergence of new aviation powerhouses.

European aerospace should aspire to lead this coming revolution in innovation and the transition to a more sustainable aviation sector. The EU’s flagship innovation programmes are well placed to nurture the radical technologies that will allow Europe to reaffirm its aerospace leadership for decades to come.

To prosper in this changing world, Airbus needs the support of the EU more than ever. For example, the EU’s financial and political backing will be critical to the development of Europe’s next generation of satellite technology and fighter jets.

Amid protectionism and political fragmentation, the bloc must continue to champion free trade in Europe and beyond. The EU should also remain grounded in the geo-political reality of global aerospace: the sector’s strategic significance means the EU’s ability to project a strong, united voice has a direct bearing on Europe’s prospects.

Airbus can thus renew the legacy of our founders who came together 50 years ago with an ambitious vision of innovation and international partnership - and the nerve to realize it.

The world of 1969 vanished long ago, but theirs remains a story for our times.

Alberto Robles, Head of Airbus Strategy & International for Latin America, said that the presence of Airbus in Argentina is a natural step in increasing Airbus’ activity in the region. “There are great opportunities for Airbus in Latin America, and this new office in Buenos Aires is essential to consolidate our products in the region, while continuing to provide an even closer support to our customers in the country.”

Airbus has been present in Argentina for decades. In 1994 Aerolíneas Argentinas became an Aibrus customer with the A310-300. Today, the airline operates a long-range fleet of 10 A330 and two A340. Airbus also established a maintenance training centre in collaboration with Aerolíneas Argentinas to support the airline’s growth. Airbus maintains 35 percent market share of the country’s passenger fleet in service. LATAM and JetSmart also operate in Argentina with their A320 Family aircraft, the world's most popular single-aisle aircraft family.

With more than 40 years in Latin America, Airbus helicopters represent a third of the country’s operating fleet, mainly in service with the Armed Forces and other public institutions such as the Federal Police, the National Gendarmerie, and the Naval Prefecture in several provinces. The more than 85 helicopters in service have a key role in performing vital operations for the population such as border protection and helping to fight against organized crime, search and rescue missions in mountainous areas, firefighting and emergency medical transport. In an effort to closely support its customer operators, Airbus Helicopters also established a maintenance centre in Argentina to improve operations and increase rotorcraft availability.

As part of its on-going contribution to the development of the aerospace industry in the country, Airbus Defence and Space signed an agreement in 2017 with the Argentine aircraft factory ""Brigadier San Martín"" (FAdeA) to support the Airbus C212 of the Army and Naval Prefecture. These aircraft have been serving the country's Armed Forces and Security sector for more than 25 years.

With over 1,300 employees located throughout 18 sites across eight countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and a regional hub in Miami, Airbus continues to expand its presence in Latin America with its new facility in Argentina.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9989326596260071}",positive,0.9989326596260071,1

Taufkirchen, 7 May 2019 – Representatives of Airbus and Siemens are attending the Bauhaus Luftfahrt Symposium “Ambition 2050”, which is taking place in Taufkirchen on May 7 and 8. The event is bringing together science, industry, and politicians to tackle head on how to work together to meet the EU Flightpath 2050 goals to meet aviation’s challenging environmental targets. Topics to be explored include operations, alternative fuels, as well as energy technologies and power systems, which is at the heart of the work being carried out within the Airbus E-Aircraft Systems Programme in Taufkirchen/Ottobrunn near Munich.

While no single technology will allow the industry to become emission free, as Glenn Llewellyn, Electrification General Manager at Airbus will highlight on day one of the symposium, electric and hybrid electric propulsion technologies are some of the most promising. This is why Airbus is actively exploring how to apply such technologies across its portfolio, from helicopters and VTOLs all the way to commercial aircraft, with demonstrators such as CityAirbus and E-Fan X.

A key part of this research started in April 2016, Airbus and Siemens started a joint collaboration for hybrid-electric propulsion systems with the objective to demonstrate the technical feasibility of these eco-friendly technologies.

“We have worked very closely with Siemens eAircraft over the course of the last three years to research hybrid-electric technologies,” said Martin Nuesseler, Head of E-Aircraft Systems Programme at Airbus. “Siemens contributed their profound know-how in electric drives and power electronics and their strong capability to deliver innovative solutions to our ambitious projects. The results we have achieved this far pave the way towards the future of hybrid electric flight. We are sure that Siemens eAircraft will continue to be a close partner of Airbus in future.”

“It was a great experience to work together in tightly-knit teams with Airbus colleagues,” stated Frank Anton, Head of Siemens eAircraft, on the topic of the companies’ collaboration. “Their competence in aircraft architecture and design offered us the chance as a propulsion system provider to develop our solutions for concrete platforms. We very much look forward to being able to take these competencies in industrialized manner to our partners.”

JetBlue’s Newly Redesigned Airbus A320 Fits More (and Comfier) Seats - AFAR Media,"Tue, 14 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmYXIuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lL2pldGJsdWUtcGVyZm9ybXMtc2VhdC1jb21mb3J0LW1hZ2ljLXdpdGgtbmV3bHktcmVkZXNpZ25lZC1haXJidXPSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZmFyLmNvbS9tYWdhemluZS9qZXRibHVlLXBlcmZvcm1zLXNlYXQtY29tZm9ydC1tYWdpYy13aXRoLW5ld2x5LXJlZGVzaWduZWQtYWlyYnVzP19hbXA9dHJ1ZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"There’s nothing magical about economy-class air travel. But with JetBlue’s snazzy new gray, orange and, of course, blue redesign of the interiors of its workhorse Airbus A320 planes—the carrier’s first of said aircraft in almost 20 years—the airline has managed to pull off a pretty neat trick.

Despite increasing the number of passengers who can fit onboard to 162 from 150, the redesigned planes have wider seats than they did before (18.4 inches versus 17.8 inches). And the company still maintains its claim to the greatest legroom in coach, based on average seat pitch, among domestic airlines. In some ways, that’s a low bar, since most U.S. airlines provide a squished 30 or 31 inches, and low-cost carriers may give you an expletive-inducing 28 inches.

As it happens, the redesigned A320’s 32 inches is actually two inches less than it was before. But after getting a tour of the refit planes from JetBlue top brass at Logan Airport in Boston earlier this month, I’m here to tell you that pitch numbers notwithstanding, this is one roomy—and, thanks to mood lighting, pretty groovy—aircraft.

So how’d they do it? How do you add two more rows of seats and still make all 6’ 3” of me feel like I’ve got knee space to spare, even when I’m in standard economy?

According to JetBlue’s head of product development, Mariya Stoyanova, it all comes down to smart seat design, specifically seat shape. The A320’s new next-generation seats are slimmer, which means you can fit more of them on a plane without crowding, and they exploit the curvature of the aircraft’s sides to maximize width. A super-skinny and simple armrest also provides you with more side-to-side leeway. (If I have any quibble with these seats, it’s that these armrests don’t offer much in the way of softness, and there’s zero chance they could be shared, even if you’re flying next to your significant other, let alone a stranger.)

Slim seats only get you so far, however. JetBlue worked with the manufacturer to carve out the bulk from seatbacks right where they usually hit the legs of the person behind you. It worked: Even when the guy in front of me reclined, I was in the clear, although my laptop on the tray table still got a bit jostled.

When it comes to seat customization, Stoyanova says JetBlue can be demanding. The brand’s collaboration with the seat maker here enhanced comfort beyond the increased sense of space. JetBlue wanted more memory foam added to the leather cushions, whose curves in multiple directions ergonomically embrace you the way the driver’s seat of a great German car does.

There are also new adjustable headrests designed to be functional and usable, says Stoyanova. And they are. They go up—way up—and stay up, and the side flaps firmly adjust to cradle your head.

The other major onboard innovations focus on in-flight entertainment. That’s something else in which JetBlue, with its seatback screens, live DirectTV, and free Wi-Fi, has long been a leader. Now, it’s upping the ante further.

To that end, the refit planes offer more on-demand movie selections—100-plus channels of live Direct TV, almost triple the 36 that were were previously available, with new DVR-style pause, rewind, and fast-forward functions. There are also USB and traditional power plugs in front of each seat, versus underneath, which required what Stoyanova refers to as all sorts of “yoga poses” to reach. And, most important, these planes have free, fast gate-to-gate Wi-Fi on almost every route they fly. Up until 2017, JetBlue offered free Wi-Fi only at cruising altitude (similar to what most other airlines offer) and since then has offered gate-to-gate Wi-Fi on all but Caribbean and Latin American flights. Those flights are now fully connected as well.

As for those seatback screens, they’re now 10.1 inches compared to the six inches they used to be, and you can wirelessly pair your phone with them to use as a remote control. This was cool—though, honestly, it’s not like it takes all that much extra effort to reach forward and touch the screen to operate the system.

By the end of the year, a third of JetBlue’s A320s will have been retrofit, with the vast majority done by the end of 2020. The catch right now is that there’s no easy way to tell when you’re booking if you’ll be on one of the renovated planes or not, which is too bad. (Look at a flight’s seat map; if there are 27 rows instead of 25, it’s a refit plane.) Sure, we’re still more likely to make a decision based on a flight’s cost and time, but the refit planes represent enough of an improvement that, if there were a simple way to know that I would be flying on one, I would be very willing to pay a bit more or wake up a bit earlier—or both—to get on board.

A European desire to advance collaborative defence programmes saw MBB take its place within an industrial grouping responsible for the development and production of a new Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA). The result of that effort – also involving Italy’s Alenia and the UK’s then-BAC – was the variable-geometry Panavia Tornado, a technological marvel of its age, combining the supersonic speed and terrain-following capability needed to support nuclear strike missions with pilot-friendly handling performance at low speed. A first prototype made its debut flight from MBB’s Manching site near Munich in August 1974.

Tornado project proved value of multinational approach

Airbus

In addition to creating a versatile combat asset, the MRCA project encouraged closer industrial alignment. In Flight International’s 26 September 1974 issue, we reported on the first display appearance of the Tornado, noting: “The spirit of European collaboration positively hung in the air in Manching”. BAC chief test pilot Paul Millett – the first to fly the type – gave his programme perspective, saying: “The whole project is conducted in a friendly atmosphere and one of mutual respect, which increases all the time.”

Germany and the UK each held a 42.5% workshare in the aircraft via the Panavia consortium, with Italy responsible for the remaining 15%. MBB manufactured the centre fuselage section for each Tornado, and performed final assembly for the German air force.

In all, 992 aircraft were built for the three partner nations, plus export buyer Saudi Arabia. The UK earlier this year retired its last GR4-model examples, but Cirium’s Fleets Analyzer shows that the Tornado remains a stalwart for its other operators, with around 270 still in use.

The MBB name remained in use for two decades before the company was subsumed by Daimler-Benz in 1989, for the creation of DaimlerChrysler Aerospace SA (DASA).

The industrial experience gained with the MRCA was later put to good effect with the European Fighter Aircraft programme, which saw Spain join the Tornado manufacturing nations in developing the Eurofighter. To date, more than 500 examples of the multi-role type have been delivered to the four partners, along with international operators Austria, Oman and Saudi Arabia. The Typhoon is also currently in production for Kuwait and Qatar, and further sales are anticipated, with multiple opportunities being pursued by Airbus, BAE Systems and Leonardo.

Another major pillar of the modern-day Airbus Defence & Space is its extensive military airlifter product range, which ranges in size from the C295 medium transport to the tactical A400M Atlas and its A330 widebody-derived multi-role tanker/transport (MRTT).

This unit’s origins date back to the C212 Aviocar, first flown by Spain’s CASA in 1971. The company, with production activities at the San Pablo site near Seville, was merged with DASA in 1999, along with France’s Aerospatiale Matra, to create EADS. Subsequently operating as Airbus Military, its key task was to deliver Europe’s A400M as a successor for the Franco-German Transall and Lockheed C-130.

After a long gestation, a combined development and production contract was signed in May 2003 with the multinational OCCAR defence procurement agency, on behalf of Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, Turkey and the UK. The first delivery was made in late 2013, and in the first quarter of this year Airbus shipped its 75th example, from a combined European commitment for 170.

The A400M has weighed heavily on Airbus over the past several years, due to development challenges and the delayed addition of promised tactical capabilities, which have resulted in financial penalties. The enormity of this contractual mire only became fully apparent well into the project, with the company’s own history page rather understatedly noting: “Airbus set the bar high in terms of technical and programme complexity”.

A400M programme has been beset by development snags

Messe Berlin

Challenges included the pursuit of certification not only from military authorities, but also via the European Union Aviation Safety Agency. The airframer also struggled due to an over-ambitious development schedule and as a result of the type’s Europrop International TP400-D6 turboprop engine, for which the company had assumed overall responsibility.

Not disguising his frustration as Airbus called for a “re-baselining” of the programme in 2017, then-group chief executive Tom Enders described its signature of the single development and production contract as an “original sin”. The company hopes that discussions over a revised deal will finally conclude around mid-2019.

Meanwhile, the C295 – a stretched and improved development of the CN235 model first flown in 1983 – has established itself as the market leader in its class.

The A330 MRTT has also been a strong performer, with sales made to Australia, France, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, the UK, the United Arab Emirates and a multinational group of NATO nations so far comprising Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Norway. The twinjet – which boasts a 111t fuel capacity and the ability to carry up to 300 passengers – also won selection for the US Air Force’s original KC-X requirement, but ultimately lost out to Boeing’s 767-derived KC-46A Pegasus for the 179-aircraft contract.

Opportunities are now being sought for further military derivatives of Airbus’s commercial products. A proposed modular multi-mission – or M3 – development of the A320neo, intended to perform roles such as maritime patrol, is gaining early momentum, with France and Germany needing to replace their ageing fleets of Dassault Atlantics and Lockheed P-3s in the coming years. The type could also be adapted for airborne early warning (AEW) and intelligence-gathering tasks, Airbus believes.

Any future success would come on top of the more than 1,800 military aircraft ordered from Airbus’s defence arm over recent decades. The company says more than 1,600 have been delivered to date, with around 1,300 of these still in operational service.

Another strong focus area for Airbus is unmanned air vehicles (UAVs), ranging from its use of Israel Aerospace Industries Heron 1s on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions supporting the German military, to developing its own products. Having proved key technologies with its Barracuda unmanned combat air vehicle demonstrator, it is now advancing long-held ambitions to develop a European medium-altitude, long-endurance system in conjunction with industry partners across the continent. After a false dawn with its Talarion concept, championed during the company’s short-lived Cassidian era, the programme is now advancing via a pact also involving France, Italy and Spain.

Other examples of innovative Airbus defence products – such as a proposed AEW version of the C295 explored with Israeli industry, and the Mako high-energy advanced trainer – have impressed, but failed to make it to in-service status.

Meanwhile, efforts to boost European industrial collaboration have flourished with MBDA, the group’s its largest guided weapons company. Airbus has a 37.5% holding in the manufacturer, with its stake equal to that of BAE, and with Leonardo accounting for the remaining 25%. With products including the Storm Shadow cruise missile and beyond-visual-range Meteor air-to-air missile, MBDA reported sales worth €4 billion ($4.4 billion) last year.

Today, Airbus is the largest defence company in Europe, with 33,000 employees working at 16 production sites and with a presence in Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain and the UK. In addition to its military aircraft activities, which produced 52% of its revenue last year, its business also includes space systems and a communications, intelligence and security arm, also covering cyber activities.

And the company could have grown larger still, had European legislators and governments backed a suggested merger with BAE, which was formally abandoned in 2013.

It has rationalised its activities over recent years as part of Airbus’s wider efficiency drive, notably divesting its Defence Electronics business to Germany’s KKR. Completed in February 2017, this deal led to the emergence of radar and sensor house Hensoldt. Airbus transferred its last holding in the company in September 2018.

“After streamlining our portfolio we are now well positioned, with a clear focus on smarter products, more service-based offerings and accelerating digital innovation,” Airbus Defence & Space chief executive Dirk Hoke said of the sale.

In terms of business performance, the defence arm recorded sales worth €8.4 billion in 2018, ending the year with an order backlog worth more than €35.3 billion. In revenue terms it brought in 17% of Airbus’s total earnings, compared with 74% from its commercial business.

Looking ahead, a potentially key Future Combat Air System (FCAS) concept launched by France and Germany could further reduce duplication of effort between Airbus and Dassault in the fighter arena.

Hoke points to the huge potential of the pact in both commercial and collaborative terms, saying: “FCAS is one of the most ambitious European defence programmes of the century. Both companies are committed to providing the best solutions to our nations with regard to the new-generation fighter, as well as the systems of systems accompanying it.” This is likely to also include combat UAVs and strike weapons.

Spain has already joined the effort, and Enders earlier this year repeated his desire for the UK to also consider getting involved. “By no means are we of the opinion that this should be a closed shop for the French and the Germans – I very much hope that after all the history, legacy and good experience we have working with our British partners on the Typhoon that eventually it will make a lot of sense to join, to build one strong programme in Europe,” he said.

But despite the significant level of defence industry consolidation so far achieved in Europe, the sector now appears highly balanced, with the preservation of several national champions: Airbus in France, Germany and Spain, plus BAE in the UK, Leonardo in Italy and for Sweden, Saab.

In Enders’ words, Airbus has successfully transformed what was once “a conglomerate of various bits and pieces from France, Germany, Spain and the UK: different brands – different fiefdoms.” He adds: “We have shown what Europe can achieve when it works together.”

For Hoke and his colleagues, the challenge now facing Airbus’s defence unit is to turn the “overall stable business performance” of today into something more akin to the stellar success of its commercial arm.

@AirbusSpace @MEASAT #satellite

Washington DC, USA, 06 May 2019 – Airbus has been selected by MEASAT Global Berhad (“MEASAT”), the leading Malaysian operator, to build MEASAT-3d, a new multimission telecommunications satellite to replace capacity and augment its core business in Malaysia, Asia, Middle East and Africa.

Positioned at 91.5°E collocated with MEASAT-3b, also built by Airbus, MEASAT-3d will deliver improved performances to progressively replace MEASAT-3 and MEASAT-3a, supporting Asia’s premium DTH (direct to home) video distribution.

Planned to be launched in 2021, MEASAT-3d will provide C and Ku-bands capacity for DTH, video distribution and telecommunication services. The new HTS Ka-band mission features multiple user spot beams optimized to deliver high speed broadband communications over Malaysia to bridge the digital divide in the country.

It will also carry an L-band navigation hosted payload for the Korea Augmentation Satellite System (KASS) for KTSAT.

MEASAT-3d is based on Airbus’ proven and highly reliable Eurostar E3000 satellite platform. Planned for more than 15 years of operation, MEASAT-3d is designed to have an electrical power of 12kW.

Dr Edmund Kong, MEASAT’s Chief Technology Officer said, “We are delighted to once again appoint Airbus as the manufacturer of MEASAT’s 8th communication satellite. With MEASAT-3d, MEASAT reaffirms its commitment to provide core infrastructure for the Malaysian ICT and broadcast industry. Collocated with MEASAT-3a and MEASAT-3b at 91.5°E, MEASAT-3d will serve the growth requirements of 4G & 5G mobile networks in Malaysia while continuing to provide redundancy and additional distribution capacity for video in HD, 4K and ultimately 8K in the Asia-Pacific region. Furthermore, MEASAT-3d will aid in bridging the digital divide in Malaysia by enabling 100% coverage for high speed consumer broadband services to all Malaysian households.”

Arnaud de Rosnay, Head of Telecom Satellites at Airbus said: “MEASAT has selected Airbus again to build their new multimission satellite which will be based on our highly reliable Eurostar E3000 product. There are already 46 E3000 satellites operating successfully in orbit and Airbus is committed to providing innovative and “best-in-class” satellite solutions to enable MEASAT to be the operator of choice in the region. The mission also builds on Airbus’ unique heritage in the field of SBAS (Satellite Based Augmentation System) navigation payloads. It is a great honor to have been trusted by both MEASAT and KTSAT to combine their missions, a true testament to our collective ability to be flexible – a key differentiator in today’s market.""

Fifty years ago at the Paris air show, France's transport minister and Germany's economy minister signed an agreement that would change aviation history.

The year was 1969 and Europe needed a smaller, lighter and more cost-effective passenger aircraft than American rivals. Five years later, the A300B2 was born, a short-to-medium range plane with two engines, despite safety concerns in an era when three engines was the standard minimum.

Fast-forward to 2019, Airbus is celebrated as a success of European cooperation, one of two kings of global civil aviation along with Boeing. Around the world, an Airbus takes off or lands every two seconds.

It now produces passenger planes ranging in size up to the A380 jumbo jet, helicopters, fighter jets and is even involved in space exploration.

Its story has been marked by setbacks, political turbulence and production problems but Airbus management believes it can confidently look forward to the next half century.

""Airbus produces half of the world's large commercial aircraft and has thriving helicopter, defence and space businesses,"" said CEO Guillaume Faury, who in April replaced Tom Enders who served five years at the helm.

Airbus' defence division is the biggest shareholder in the consortium that makes the Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jet

""We employ 130,000 highly-skilled people globally and are a powerful engine of productivity, exports and innovation for Europe.""

The firm delivered its last thousand planes in just 30 months. But in the early days, it took nearly twenty years to produce a thousand aircraft.

It faced criticism for developments like fly-by-wire controls, which improve handling, and flight envelope protection, which stop the plane performing manoeuvres outside its performance limits.

Apart from technological advances, cracking America was a key ingredient in creating the global giant. The A300 made a strong impression on Frank Borman, the former Apollo astronaut who headed Eastern Air Lines and championed the idea of buying more economical planes.

Airbus's backbone, the A320

In 1984, Airbus launched the A320, a single-aisle, medium-haul aircraft to challenge Boeing, which until then had dominated the largest segment in the civil aviation market.

Originally the Bombardier C Series, the rebranded A220-300 helped Airbus fill demand for a slightly smaller medium-range aircraft with the latest in fuel efficient design

The aircraft paved the way for the more fuel efficient A320neo which has become the backbone of the company, strengthening its hold on the key market segment after Boeing's 737 MAX planes were grounded after two deadly crashes in March and October.

Despite a failed deal with British defence firm BAE Systems in 2012, Airbus' partnership with Canadian Bombadier's C Series programme in 2018 enhanced its position as a global force.

France and Germany still hold 11 percent stakes in Airbus through holding companies with a smaller 4 percent stake held by the Spanish government. The rest of the shares are traded on the stock exchange.

But production hasn't always run smoothly. The firm announced in January it would scrap production of its A380 passenger giant by 2021 due to lack of orders.

The double decker jet earned plaudits from passengers but failed to win over enough airlines to justify its massive costs.

Key clients have also hit trouble as some airlines hit financial difficulty with Europe's third biggest low-cost airline Norwegian saying it was further delaying deliveries of Airbus and Boeing 737 MAX planes it had ordered.

The double-decker Airbus A380-800 has been lauded by passengers, but it can be costly to operate for airlines, which failed to order enough of them for Airbus to continue manufacturing the aircraft

The company in April reported a slump in first quarter net profits which fell 86 percent from the same period in 2018 at 40 million euros ($45 million).

Airbus is also under investigation in France, Britain and the United States after disclosing transaction irregularities in 2016, while US President Donald Trump has threatened the European Union with new tariffs if it does not end subsidies to Airbus.

But analysts see Airbus as having an opportunity to profit from the booming airline market, particularly in Asia, and from the global grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX series plane after two recent deadly crashes involving the popular new airliner.

Airbus's boss Guillaume Faury said the firm aims to continue being a leader in aviation innovation.

""The aerospace industry stands on the cusp of a technological revolution to match anything in its history"", he said.

""European aerospace should aspire to lead this coming revolution in innovation and the transition to a more sustainable aviation sector.""

OneSat brings best value for money, reducing cost and time to orbit thanks to a highly innovative approach

London / Toulouse 30 May 2019 – Airbus has signed a contract with Inmarsat, the world leader in global mobile satellite communications, to design, manufacture and build the first in their next generation of geostationary Ka-band satellites, Inmarsat GX7, 8 & 9. The three satellites are the first to be based on Airbus’ new OneSat product line, which is fully reconfigurable in orbit.

Featuring on board processing and active antennas, the three Ka-band spacecraft will be able to adjust their coverage, capacity and frequency. They will deliver power and bandwidth dynamically in real-time to adapt to Inmarsat’s requirements to provide HTS (High Throughput) broadband connectivity for the mobility market.

Airbus’ highly innovative OneSat is based on a standard, modular and design-to-manufacture approach, and can be delivered more quickly than existing telecommunications satellites.

Airbus’ Head of Space Systems, Nicolas Chamussy said: “We are launching the OneSat product line for our customer Inmarsat, following the successes of the Airbus-built Inmarsat-4 spacecraft, Alphasat and the Inmarsat-6 satellites, which are currently under construction. This latest contract continues the long standing innovation relationship between Airbus and Inmarsat. OneSat is a truly disruptive product, both from a manufacturing, and operational point of view, which allows Airbus to offer our customer a market enabling solution with reduced cost and time to orbit.”

“OneSat’s high flexibility, very compact design and fast production approach perfectly fits our ambition for our next generation GX spacecraft,” said Rupert Pearce, CEO of Inmarsat. “The new satellites will support the growth of the Global Xpress mobility services, in particular to service emerging ‘hot spot’ regions worldwide. The GX7, 8 & 9 satellites will represent the next evolution of HTS technology incorporating new highly flexible capabilities which can be deployed very quickly to support the rapid evolution of the traffic growth from year 2023 onwards.”

The ‘ready-made’ OneSat satellite relies on Airbus’ heritage from its highly reliable Eurostar telecommunications satellites plus its experience in mega-constellation manufacturing.

The investments made by Airbus and its partners in very innovative OneSat developments are supported by the European Space Agency and national agencies, in particular the UK and French space agencies.

"Bjorn’s Corner: Airbus about Urban Air Mobility: Stop dreaming, Start making - Leeham News and Analysis","Fri, 24 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxOS8wNS8yNC9iam9ybnMtY29ybmVyLWFpcmJ1cy1hYm91dC11cmJhbi1haXItbW9iaWxpdHktc3RvcC1kcmVhbWluZy1zdGFydC1tYWtpbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"May 24, 2019, ©. Leeham News: “Stop dreaming, Start making” was the angle of Airbus responsible for Urban Air Mobility (UAM), Eduardo Dominguez Puerta, presenting during Airbus Innovation days in Toulouse this week.

He also said, over 90% of the present UAM projects will not make it into a certified operational platform. Here’s why.

The motivation is there, but not the rules

Puerta said the motivation for Urban Air Mobility is there, Figure 1. It will start off as a service for the wealthy, then migrate to the masses. This is how most new ways of transportation have progressed.

While there will be a lot of skills needed to achieve a functioning eco-system, Figure 3, having all the function blocks in place for a viable Urban Air Mobility system is not the main hurdle for the projects.

Certification is.

Urban Air Mobility is about transporting people over the heads of other people. It will only be allowed with absolute safety. And certifying a vehicle to this absolute safety requires the certification rules which stipulates what must be achieved. For the propulsion system. For the navigation system. For the automated flight.

But these regulations do not exist. In fact, they are not even in the making. First discussions have started, but not more.

Airbus has two flying UAMs, the Vahana (Silicon Valley, Figure 4) and CityAirbus (Airbus Helicopter at Donauworth Germany, Figure 5).

Neither of these will make it to a certified vehicle says Puerta. As there are no certification rules, they couldn’t be designed to be certifiable. They are demonstrators, as are all the other Urban Air Mobility vehicles. And this is what will kill most projects.

When investor learns their spent money has not brought them close to a practical system, and this requires a long wait for rules, followed by design, production and certification of a different vehicle, they will stop. Only a few projects will make it through to certification when the rules will finally be there, says Puerta.

Certification rules are the work ahead, not further vehicles

Puerta said Airbus will not invest in further vehicle projects until certification rules are there. And to get these rules requires Airbus to engage with its competitors to help authorities create these rules.

This is now the top priority, not further flying vehicles, as they don’t bring Airbus closer to the goal, a functioning Urban Air Mobility system.

Airbus announces major performance improvement to its latest single-aisle aircraft – the A220 Family - Airbus,"Tue, 21 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wNS1haXJidXMtYW5ub3VuY2VzLW1ham9yLXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLWltcHJvdmVtZW50LXRvLWl0cy1sYXRlc3Qtc2luZ2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A220 aircraft range increased by up to 450 nm, opening new route possibilities for airlines around the world

Airbus today announced that the A220 Family aircraft, the newest addition to its single-aisle portfolio, will now be offering increased range starting from H2 2020.

The A220 aircraft maximum take-off weight (MTOW*) is now confirmed to increase by 2,268 kg (2.3 metric tonnes). The new MTOW will increase the respective maximum range capabilities to 3,350 nm for the A220-300 and 3,400 nm for the A220-100, some 450 nm more than currently advertised.

“In true Airbus tradition we improve our products constantly,” said Christian Scherer, Chief Commercial Officer, Airbus. “This new MTOW will allow operators to reach markets which today cannot be served by other small single-aisle aircraft types.”

“Since its entry-into-service close to three years ago, the A220 aircraft has already proven that it is meeting or beating its initial performance targets, bringing more flexibility and revenue potential to customers,” said Rob Dewar, Head of Engineering & Customer Support for the A220. “Today, Airbus is reinforcing its confidence in the A220 platform and further enhancing its capabilities to meet upcoming market requirements.”

This performance increase is achieved by taking credit of existing structural and systems margins as well as existing fuel volume capacity. This will allow airlines to tap into new routes that were not possible before, connecting key cities in Western Europe with the Middle East or from Southeast Asia to Australia.

The A220 has been purpose built for efficiency. It brings together state-of-the-art aerodynamics, advanced materials and Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation PW1500G geared turbofan engines to offer at least 20% lower fuel burn per seat compared to previous generation aircraft.

With an order book of over 530 aircraft to date, the A220 has all the credentials to win the lion’s share of the 100- to 150-seat aircraft market, estimated to represent 7,000 aircraft over the next 20 years.



Notes to editors

The current basic MTOW is at 60.8 t for the A220-100 and 67.6 t for the A220-300. With the new MTOW increase of 2.3 t, the respective aircraft’s MTOW will be brought up at 63.1 t for the A220-100 and 69.9 for the A220-300.

Gov. Kay Ivey joined Airbus executive Daryl Taylor Tuesday morning to announce two new training programs, FlightPath9 and Fast Track.

""Making a difference can mean many things. One is creating opportunities,"" said Taylor, vice president and general manager of Airbus' manufacturing facility in Mobile. He offered a ""simple summary"" of Tuesday's news: ""Limited or no aerospace experience equals no problem.""

Ivey praised Airbus for ""putting students on the path to a career"" and ""putting Alabama on the cutting edge of the aerospace industry.""

""That's what we're seeing happen here today,"" she said.

For high-school seniors, the first of the newly announced is a taxiway leading them directly into the second. FlightPath9 is a nine-month program of training that students attend after school. Taking place two evenings a week, it adds up to 200 hours of instruction. Upon graduation, those students are then ready to enter Airbus' Fast Track program.

Fast Track is a 12- to 15-week experience designed to give new Airbus hires training in the basic skills, knowledge and abilities for a career in aerospace maintenance Taylor said it teaches ""a program of global competencies for working on aircraft: torqueing, riveting, gauging, reading blueprints, how to use tools, ergonomics and more.""

Fast Track is not limited to students from the FlightPath9 program or to candidates from the Mobile area.

FlightPath9's initial crop of 25 high school students was introduced on Tuesday. Juniors now, they'll attend FlightPath9 throughout the 2019-2020 academic year. Eleven high schools were represented: Alma Bryant, Baker, B.C. Rain, Citronelle, Mary G. Montgomery, Blount, McGill-Toolen, Saraland, Satsuma, St. Michael and Davidson.

The largest contingents came from B.C. Rain, with five students, and McGill-Toolen Catholic High School, with six. Michelle Hurdle, director of economic and community development for Airbus Americas, said the students were chosen through an extended process in which Airbus and the Flight Works education center first contacted school counselors for recommendations on candidates. Other steps included meetings with candidates and their parents, a written application, a drug test, and interviews.

Hurdle said McGill-Toolen's share simply represented the energy with which the school and its students pursued the opportunity. ""They applied,"" she said. The connection between McGill-Toolen and St. Michael Catholic High School in Fairhope also led to that institution being the only Baldwin County School to have a participant.

Mobile City Councilman C.J. Small, whose District 3 includes B.C. Rain, said he was thrilled to see the school so well represented. Small is among council members who have been particularly interested in seeing Airbus open up pathways for local students. Rain has an aviation academy offering some special programs, and its proximity to the Brookley Aeroplex also has helped foster connections with Airbus.

""This is a great day not just for the state of Alabama but for the children, the youth of the Mobile area,"" Small said.

""I'm happy to know that B.C. Rain has a large presence, because Airbus is in their backyard,"" he said.

One of those B.C. Rain students, Ty'Nora Edwards, said she's eager to go through the program. ""It's very exciting,"" she said of being in the first class. She's not solely focused on working for Airbus, she said: She has the ambition to carry her aerospace-industry training into the U.S. Navy, she said.

The first class of FlightPath9 will enter Fast Track in summer 2020, at which point they'll be paid employees of Airbus, Taylor said. But Fast Track isn't limited to students coming through FlightPath9 and it'll have classes between now and then. Hurdle said the first starts June 10 and still has openings, she said. (Job openings can be found at Airbususmanufacturing.applicantpro.com/jobs/.)

Hurdle described the first class of FlightPath9 as a pilot program. The number of students and schools involved in future classes may change in the future, depending on Airbus' anticipated needs, she said. She said that the program costs more than $7,000 per student, but enough funding was available this year that it's free to the families of the participating students.

Over the next couple of years, a significant increase in the company's Mobile workforce is anticipated. The company plans a gradual increase in production on its established Final Assembly Line for A320-family jets, and it's building a new line for A220 jets. Production of A220s is to begin later this year, with the first one to be delivered in 2020.

Taylor said construction of the new Final Assembly Line is ""right on track.""

""It's unbelievable seeing the buildings rise from the ground,"" he said.

FlightPath9 will be run by Flight Works Alabama, the aerospace education center being developed by the state and Airbus. Partners include Airbus, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Cintas, Snap-On Tools, Southwest Alabama Partnership for Training & Employment and the National Coalition of Certification Centers.

According to Airbus, ideal candidates for FlightPath9 and Fast Track are people who have an aptitude for working with their hands; have an interest in the aviation industry; are drug-free; are able to read, write and do basic math; and can work with a team. Fast Track candidates not coming out of should be able to show reliability in past jobs.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999911785125732}",neutral,0.9999911785125732,0

With new fuel-efficient engines, aerodynamic improvements and the advanced Airspace by Airbus cabin, the A330-900 will give Delta a premier long-haul, wide-body aircraft with exceptionally low operating costs.

Delta was the launch customer for the A330-900, ordering 25 in November 2014 and an additional 10 last year. With the addition of the A330-900, Delta is now operating both of Airbus’ newest wide-body models. It has 13 A350-900s in its fleet with another 12 on order. Delta operates more than 265 Airbus aircraft, including A321s and A220s, and the airline’s order backlog with Airbus exceeds 270, including 100 A321neos.

Delta is one of the world’s leading airlines, an industry pacesetter. As the A330-900 is placed into service on Delta's global network, it will complement the airline's growing wide-body fleet of A330s and A350 XWBs, setting new standards for efficiency, profitability, and provide passengers with extraordinary travel experiences.

An environmental milestone was set as a Delta crew ferried the new A330-900 back to the company’s Atlanta base using a jet fuel blended from conventional sources and non-petroleum synthetic fuel.

Delta will initially base its A330-900s at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, where it will operate the aircraft on flights to Shanghai, Seoul and Tokyo Narita. Delta will configure its A330-900s for 281 passengers, including 29 in business-class suites, 28 in premium economy, 56 in extra-legroom economy seats, and 168 in standard economy. The aircraft will feature Delta's new internally developed in-flight entertainment system.

The A330neo is a true new-generation aircraft, building on the features of the popular A330 features and leveraging technology developed for the A350 XWB technology.

Powered by the latest Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, and featuring a new wing with increased span and A350 XWB-inspired Sharklets, the A330neo provides an unprecedented level of efficiency – with 25% lower fuel burn per seat than previous generation competitors.

Equipped with the Airbus Airspace cabin, the A330neo offers a unique passenger experience with more personal space and the latest generation in-flight entertainment system and connectivity.

The A330-900 can accommodate 287 seats in a typical three-class layout or up to 440 for high-density configurations with a range of up to 7,200 nautical miles.

While the growth of Collins' Foley operations hasn't drawn an international spotlight the way the rapid development of Airbus' jetliner assembly plant in Mobile has, its impact on the area is inarguably huge. Where a new assembly line and increased production rates may eventually raise Airbus' Mobile workforce to about 1,000 people, Collins already employs more than 1,100.

Thursday's celebration tied in, to some extent, with the 50th anniversary of Airbus' founding, which the company celebrated on Wednesday. ""Our relationship with Airbus actually goes back further than those 50 years,"" said Jim Pollock, Collins Aerospace vice president of Airbus programs. He explained that precursor companies of Collins and Airbus had worked together on components of the Concorde. That led, a few years later, to the decision to develop operations in France to support Airbus' then-new A300 jets.

""As Airbus grew over time … we made a commitment we were going to be with them throughout their journey,"" Pollock said.

Collins’ Foley plant specializes in the manufacture and refurbishment of engine nacelles and related components. The nacelle isn’t simply a cover that wraps around a jet engine: It includes the inlet ahead of the engine’s fans, the pylon that anchors the engine on the wing and the thrust reverser that allows a jetliner to brake and maneuver on the ground.

Daryl Taylor, vice president and general manager of Airbus’ Mobile assembly plant, credited Collins (previously known as UTC) with showing the potential for aerospace industry growth in southeast Alabama long before Airbus arrived. “You helped put this area on the map in the aerospace world,” he said.

One major milestone being celebrated Thursday was the plant's delivery of its 1,000th nacelle for Airbus' A320neo program. The ""neo"" suffix indicates new, more fuel-efficient engines for Airbus' established A320 family of jets; the Foley operation supplies nacelle components for A320neos assembled in Mobile, France, Germany and China.

Taylor said the fast-paced development and adoption of the A320neo had been ""the fastest ramp-up in our collective program history.""

In August 2017 the Foley company dedicated an 80,000-square-foot expansion devoted to the neo program, one expected to add 260 new jobs. Collins delivered its first neo engine units to the Mobile plant in February 2018. So far, Taylor said Thursday, Airbus had delivered 114 Mobile-built jets with Collins components.

""In just three and a half years we've shown the world that Alabama, and the south coast region of Alabama, is really the location for aviation and aerospace in the future,"" he said.

Pollock said he expects the acceleration to continue. The Foley plant delivered about 430 neo nacelles last year, he said, and plans call for it to deliver about 600 this year and 700 in 2020.

A second milestone was the delivery of the 9,000th engine nacelle for the older V2500 engine used for years on the A320 family. Pollock said that while that program was winding down, it would continue to provide work in Foley for decades as those components are brought back for repairs and scheduled overhauls.

""We're rapidly approaching 20,000 Collins-built nacelle systems on in-service Airbus aircraft,"" said Pollock.

Executives of Airbus and Collins said that looking forward, Collins also will supply nacelles for the A220 family of jets, which Airbus will begin producing in Mobile later this year.

Hundreds of employees attended Thursday's ceremony. Pollock told them the company's success was ""a testament to each and every one of you.""

U.S. Rep. Bradley Byrne likewise gave credit to the Collins workforce. “These milestones you’ve achieved here are really stupendous,” he said.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8784289360046387}",positive,0.8784289360046387,1
These two seventh-graders are imagining the future of flight - Airbus,"Mon, 13 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE5LTA1LXRoZXNlLXR3by1zZXZlbnRoLWdyYWRlcnMtYXJlLWltYWdpbmluZy10aGUtZnV0dXJlLW9mLWZsaWdodNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Elias Alaoui, 13, and Mark Gallmann, 12, are like most of the seventh-graders at Kantonsschule Zürcher Unterland school in Bülach, Switzerland. Except for one small detail: they just produced a written proposal detailing their concept for an electric-powered commercial aircraft.

Elias and Mark are the engineers of the future. To continue tackling the challenges of aviation, today as tomorrow, we need motivated young people on board, so it’s fundamental that we engage the younger generation.

Grazia Vittadini, Airbus CTO

Encouraged by their parents and teacher, Elias and Mark sent the written proposal to Airbus, where it fell into the hands of Grazia Vittadini, Airbus Chief Technology Officer. Their ideas impressed Grazia so much that the two seventh-graders were invited to the Airbus head office in Toulouse to discuss the concept and their passion for aviation.



“Elias and Mark are the engineers of the future,” Grazia says. “To continue tackling the challenges of aviation, today as tomorrow, we need motivated young people on board, so it’s fundamental that we engage the younger generation.”

The two-day visit included a tour of Airbus’ Research & Technology (R&T) campus, including the DISCO (disruptive cockpit) and ExO demonstrators, as well as a visit to the Airbus Defence & Space site, including the OneWeb assembly line. A two-hour visit to the A380 final assembly line was also a major highlight.

When asked what he likes most about aircraft, Elias simply grins and says: “Everything.”

A new look at future aircraft design

Elias and Mark’s aircraft concept lays out the technical specifications for an electric-powered version of a long-haul wide-body aircraft. In their written proposal, Elias and Mark detailed their view on all aspects of aircraft design, from safety features to electric-propulsion and energy-transmission technologies.

“The thought process involved in their proposal is impressive for two middle-school students,” Grazia explains. “They focus mainly on safety, connectivity and zero-emission flight, so the priorities are definitively the right ones!”

In fact, the “self-deploying landing system” they described in their proposal is strikingly similar to a technology on which Airbus teams are currently working. It is a technology that Airbus aims to deploy in the near future.

Airbus Regional Products Development Manager Philippe Mattei, who works on overall aircraft design and performance, met with Elias and Mark. Like Grazia, Philippe was impressed with the detail and insight provided in their proposal.

“We get technical aircraft design proposals from university students from time to time, but never from two middle-school-aged kids,” Philippe laughs. “It’s impressive that they were able to cover all aspects of aircraft design…and had a vision for future electric-powered aircraft!”

A vision of zero-emission air travel

Electric-propulsion technology is a central aspect of Elias and Mark’s proposal—a feature that attracted Airbus’ attention immediately. Electrification of flight is a key research area on which Airbus has been working since 2010. Key achievements include the development of two electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) demonstrator vehicles, Vahana and CityAirbus, and a hybrid-electric aircraft demonstrator, E-Fan X. The goal of these projects is to help the aviation industry develop the technologies needed to meet the goals in Flightpath’s 2050 Vision for Aviation, which includes reducing CO 2 by 75%, NOx by 90% and noise by 65%.

But for Elias and Mark, there was one question they wanted answered most of all: was their concept of electric flight actually feasible?

According to Philippe, the two are definitely on the right track:

“Their idea of energy transmission is very interesting, and something Airbus is considering for the future,” he says. “But in aircraft design, we still need a breakthrough in battery technology to make electric-powered aircraft fly.”

In the future, Elias hopes to become a test pilot and engineer. And Mark aims to become an aeronautics engineer.

Based on the quality of their aircraft proposal, there is no doubt they are already well on their way to getting there.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998019337654114}",neutral,0.9998019337654114,0
"After engines, cabin supply chain is Airbus’ biggest A320neo blocker - Runway Girl Network","Wed, 22 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTkvMDUvYWZ0ZXItZW5naW5lcy1jYWJpbi1zdXBwbHktY2hhaW4taXMtYWlyYnVzLWJpZ2dlc3QtYTMyMG5lby1ibG9ja2VyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Supply chain problems with engines are still causing headaches for raising the rate of production of the Airbus A320neo family, but the passenger experience cabin interiors supply chain comes closely behind as the company looks to exceed the planned 63-per-month aircraft rate intended for 2021, Airbus executives tell Runway Girl Network at the company’s Innovation Days outside Toulouse.

The supply chain, says executive vice president for programmes and services Philippe Mhun, “put us in kind of a corner”, but the airframer is “working on it”. On the engines side, Airbus is seeking both reliability of production and a secured, reliable supply of certain key raw materials. “We are having some discussions with both engine manufacturers, and having a look at what could be feasible in years to come,” Mhun tells RGN on the subject of raising the rate.

Airbus is still playing coy with the multiple A321neo stretches of range and fuselage that have been mooted: the “A322” fuselage stretch of the A321neo, the “A321XLR” that extends the range of the Long-Range version of the family, and an “A322LR/XLR” option set that combines both.

Reading between the lines at an event where Airbus executives are very careful not to tempt fate in criticizing Boeing, the 737 MAX problems mean the US airframer’s turn to move in the middle of the market might be delayed, especially the longer the MAX remains grounded.

This delay would give Airbus some breathing room to firm up its supply chain to prepare for the event that it wants to raise A320neo family production. Given the number of airlines converting smaller 737 MAXes to the double-stretched MAX 10, and indeed converting up to A321neo and A321LRs from the A320neo family, it would be reasonable to expect Airbus to be as keen as Boeing to sell longer, more expensive aircraft in the family that take up the same space in production queues as shorter, less expensive A320neos (or indeed A319neos).

Yet there are commercial considerations too, Scherer tells RGN. “Commercially, we want to be a little bit careful as well that we’re not doing this to flood the market. We have a lot of customers who are now engaged on this asset [the A320neo aircraft family], and we don’t want to destroy asset values or encourage too much competitive asset value dilution.”

“I am,” Scherer says, referring to the fact that he as sales supremo can’t sell more aircraft given the backlog, “in the fortunate situation to be constrained, so we keep the value of our products up quite nicely.”

But crucially, Scherer says, “the supply chain are partners, de facto, in our journey. Whenever we are looking at longer-term trends for production rate and so on, we are sharing our view with the supply chain, and depending on the commodity we are talking about the challenges of a different nature. Having a holistic view of the aerostructure, the industry is still consolidating, and these are things that could result in a higher investment capacity.”

Suppliers do, however, “still need to improve their industrial capabilities to be a more predictable partner,” Scherer says.

This message on higher investment capacity from larger conglomerates appears from Mhun during a later discussion with RGN too. “This is why we welcome the fact that, B/E being bought by Rockwell, now part of Collins, you have experts of industrialization in Collins’ world,” Mhun says.

“Safran buying Zodiac was good news for us because they bring also their industrial expertise to the product. At the end of the day this is what we are looking for. I think they are on the right path; nevertheless, the rampup is huge for them too, not only in terms of the number of aircraft times the number of seats, and we can appreciate it is an industrial challenge.”

The H135 military training helicopter is manufactured by Airbus Helicopters to meet the flight training needs of armed forces across the world. The highly versatile platform is suitable for basic, advanced and mission training.

The H135 military training helicopter is in service with a large number of military operators worldwide, including the Royal Air Force, Australian Defence Force, Brazilian Air Force, Switzerland Air Force, German Army, Japanese Maritime Self-Defence Force, Jordanian Armed Forces and Spanish Army.

Orders and deliveries

Airbus Helicopters received a 17-year contract worth £500m ($730m) from Ascent Flight Training in May 2016 to deliver 29 H135s and three hoist-equipped H145s to the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD), under the UK Military Flying Training System (UKMFTS) programme. Ascent is the UK MoD’s training service partner for the UKMFTS.

The production ramp up and the maiden flight of the first H135 for UKMFTS were concluded in June 2016. Deliveries were initially scheduled to start in 2017. However, the first aircraft was delivered ahead of schedule to UKMFTS in December 2016, while deliveries of other aircraft were completed in October 2018.

Airbus secured a contract from the Brazilian Navy in February 2019 for the delivery of three H135 military training helicopters.

H135 design and features

H135 training helicopter features an energy-absorbing fuselage and bearing-less main rotor system. The tail boom integrates a fixed horizontal stabiliser and Fenestron anti-torque device. The new rotor blades and lateral air intakes provide higher lift for the helicopter.

“Deliveries are scheduled to start in 2017 and will be completed in early-2018.”

The helicopter also integrates energy-absorbing seats and crash-resistant fuel cells. The under-fuselage is fitted with skid-type landing gear with skid protectors, while the unobstructed cabin and cargo compartments offer a storage volume of 5.9m³.

H135 measures 12.26m-long, 3.16m-wide (without blades) and 3.51m-high. The main rotor diameter of the helicopter is 10.40m and the maximum take-off weight is 2,980kg.

The helicopter’s state-of-the-art technology enables the instructor to conduct training missions in optimal safety conditions. The high fuel economy of the rotorcraft further ensures low operating and training costs.

Cockpit and avionics of the H135

H135’s advanced glass cockpit features three large electronic displays. It accommodates two crew members side by side. The night-vision goggle (NVG) compatible cockpit also incorporates a first limit indicator, which displays the engine’s operational data based on the phase of flight for the pilot in one indicator.

The Helionix suite also integrates Garmin GTN-750 GPS, navigation and communication system, a TAS620A traffic advisory system, a helicopter terrain awareness and warning system (HTAWS), cockpit control panel (CCP) and a data transfer device (DTD).

The TAS system enables pilots to detect and avoid aircraft approaching the flight path of the helicopter, while the HTAWS warns the pilots about hazardous terrain and obstacles on the flight path to avoid the risk of collision.

The innovative cockpit layout offers increased situational awareness, mission flexibility and safety.

H135 helicopter integrated with the new Helionix cockpit received the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) type certificate in November 2016. The avionics suite was certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in February 2018.

The Helionix avionics system in combination with four-axis automatic flight control system (AFCS) minimises the workload of pilots. The highly redundant system has the capability to automatically reconfigure and restore functions in the event of subsystems failure, without the need for pilot intervention.

Engine and performance of military training helicopter

The helicopter is powered by either two Pratt & Whitney Canada PW206B3 or two Turbomeca Arrius 2B2 plus turbo-shaft engines. Each engine model features a full authority digital engine control (FADEC) system and over-speed protection system. Fuel is supplied from a bladder-type main fuel tank and a supply tank.

Airbus selected PW206B3 engines to power H135 helicopters that are intended for the US Navy helicopter trainer replacement programme.

The H135 has a maximum speed of 278km/h and can attain a maximum range of 609km. The maximum operating altitude of the helicopter is 20,000ft.

The helicopter delivers superior one-engine inoperative (OEI) performance, even in hot and high conditions.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999942779541016}",neutral,0.9999942779541016,0

The Most Influential Manufacturer – Celebrating 50 Years Of Airbus - AeroTime,"Wed, 29 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjMxNTEtY2VsZWJyYXRpbmctNTAteWVhcnMtYWlyYnVz0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWVyb3RpbWUuYWVyby9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMzE1MS1jZWxlYnJhdGluZy01MC15ZWFycy1haXJidXMvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Why Airbus Is The Most Influential Aircraft Manufacturer – Celebrating 50 Years Of Airbus

Today is a very special day in aviation, as Airbus celebrates its 50th anniversary. The aircraft manufacturer, tracing its roots back to Concorde, has greatly challenged every company that builds commercial aircraft.

Airbus is known for its many innovations in commercial airspace – from being the first company to introduce a wide-body aircraft with a two engine configuration, inventing the revolutionary fly-by-wire systems, to producing the biggest passenger aircraft – the Super Jumbo Airbus A380.

But honestly speaking, the company struggled at first, as the Airbus A300 had many obstacles on its way to its first flight.

However, the company prevailed by using creativity and persistence and as a result, secured its future. The future which has brought success, innovation and a huge amount of influence to the way every single one of us flies every day.

But influence is a very broad term that can be spun and twisted in various ways. So, instead of broadly speaking about Airbus‘ history, to celebrate #Airbus50, let’s try to define how the European manufacturer has influenced the way we soar through the skies!

Airbus traces in Concorde

Essentially what Airbus is is a consortium between several countries – in 1969 it was Great Britain, France and West Germany. Back then, United States‘ manufacturers such as Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and for a brief period of time, Lockheed, dominated the aviation market.

European manufacturers did not see much success in building jets. That‘s not to say they were complete failures, but back then the passenger numbers could not justify every country building their own aircraft, in addition to the American competition. Thus, the competition had forced such manufacturers as de Havilland, which built the Comet or Sud-Aviation, which built the Caravelle, to go bust.

In order to counter the American presence, the three European nations collaborated on Concorde. But Concorde operated in a niche market, flying just several routes from Europe and offering tickets at a premium price.

So, to properly fight the Americans in the skies, the three countries I‘ve mentioned above (West Germany was not involved in Concorde), said yes to a memorandum, which laid down the foundations of Airbus in 1967.

Two years later, the official agreement to launch the first Airbus aircraft, the A300, was signed.

The day was the 29th of May, 1969.

What Concorde had brought to the table we all know – an unprecedented level of luxury and speed while traveling through the skies. Airbus had major influence on the Concorde. As the supersonic jet had departed for the last time, one of the reasons was that Airbus simply refused to provide spare parts to maintain the jet.

But let’s go back to the Airbus A300. The aircraft that had started it all officially.

50 years of the Airbus A300

While it seemed like smooth sailing at first, the A300 encountered several issues at first. But this is where the creativity of the Airbus showed its face.

Firstly, plagued by the cost of Concorde, as the SST was encountering huge production delays, both Britain and France were very doubtful about the future of Airbus. But the French government came to their senses because Henri Ziegler had told them bluntly that they would be responsible for 30 000 people being unemployed. Nevertheless, Britain had pulled the plug and now the program had a huge financial hole to fill. Fortunately, Germany increased its investment in the project and as a result, it could continue successfully.

Secondly, there was the engine issue. Airbus had contacted Rolls-Royce to build special engines for them, as Airbus planned something unheard of at the time – to build a wide-body jet with two engines. In the 70s, the only wide-body aircraft apart from the Boeing 747, were the two tri-jets. Namely, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011. As we know, the Boeing 747 carriers four engines.

At that time, the DC-10, the L-1011 and the 747 were only able to fly across the Atlantic due to ETOPS, which meant that the A300 was restricted to short or medium haul routes above land.

Anyways, Rolls-Royce was busy with the RB211, which was too small for the planned A300. The jet had no engine. However, at the same time, Airbus had realized that a 300 passenger version of the A300 would be probably too big for wide-spread commercial usage. So, what they did was they shrunk the A300 to 250 maximum seats, slap on the RB211 – problem solved.

But lastly, Airbus had not only to make the aircraft, but they also had to sell it. ETOPS had hindered the aircraft a lot, and Airbus struggled to market it.

Marketing efforts

The Airbus A300 made its maiden voyage in 1972. Two years later, the aircraft officially commenced a commercial flight with Air France. But selling the aircraft was a struggle. At first, only Air France and Lufthansa (LHAB) (LHA) operated the A300.

Lufthansa Airbus A300

ETOPS compliance and the 1973 oil crisis did not help either.

While Airbus struggled for orders, the company knew they had to do something. So, they did – they set off on a tour with the A300 in 1973. Flying from Toulouse to the United States via Dakar and Sao Paulo, Airbus‘ executives needed to convince airline CEO‘s that Airbus‘ products were on-par, if not better than aircraft that were built by Boeing, McDonnell Douglas or Lockheed. The move was daring and it succeeded, as Eastern Airlines showed interest in the A300.

But the rewards only showed up later – in 1978, Eastern Airlines ordered 23 Airbus A300s.

Airbus also heavily looked into the Asian market, as they saw huge potential there as well. In 1974, Korean Air became the first non-European airline to order A300.

Slowly, but surely the aircraft started gaining orders from all over the world. As the FAA lifted the ETOPS restrictions, the A300 could also operate medium-haul routes over more remote areas, including huge water masses.

In total, Airbus delivered 561 A300s, with the last one rolling out of the factory in 2007.

To sum up, the Airbus A300 had showcased airlines that tri-jet wide-bodies were not the future of air travel. The A300 led the way for the future of the wide-body twin-engine aircraft. Airbus had started its journey with the A300 – if the project was unsuccessful, the two governments in France and West Germany would’ve canceled Airbus altogether.

So, that‘s the first reason why Airbus is hugely influential.

The second? The Airbus A320.

Fly-by-wire usage on the Airbus A320

Airbus had set a goal for themselves – to develop various aircraft types to serve every market possible, from short-haul to long-haul.

From the A300, the A310 followed. Later on, in 1984, Airbus announced the Airbus A320, a direct competitor to the Boeing 737, which at the time was the most successful aircraft in the world. It still is, as Boeing has delivered over 10 000 of them as of 2019. In total, Airbus has delivered more than 12 000 various jets to airlines, with their 12 000th aircraft going to Delta Airlines (DAL) .

Anyhow, the Airbus A320 was far more successful from the get-go. As it was announced by Airbus, the aircraft already had 84 orders secured. American Airlines (A1G) (AAL) (not the airline, but the airlines located in the country), namely Pan Am, ordered 16 A320’s with an option to buy 34 more. A year later, in 1986, Northwest Airlines ordered a huge amount of the Airbus A320 – a whopping 100 of them.

The aircraft itself was not revolutionary, as there was already the MD-80 and the previously mentioned 737 competing for the short-haul market.

However, the Airbus A320 was hugely influential because of one reason – its controls, the fly-by-wire system. On the business side of things, the system reduced the aircraft’s weight and airlines had an easier job of maintaining it.

For pilots, it meant that the handling of the aircraft was far better than using manual flight controls and, as Airbus began using fly-by-wire throughout all of its aircraft, the training process between different aircraft was far easier, making it much easier to advance your pilot career.

For passengers, the system means much-improved safety and indirectly, reduced flight ticket costs. The system prevents excessive inputs that would hinder the aircraft’s safety.

So, the fly-by-wire presents us with the second reason.

Luxury is the third.

The unprecedented luxury of the Airbus A380

When the Boeing 747 came, it showcased to the world how comfortable can passengers travel, while to airlines it looked like a brilliant cash-cow, as it could seat so many travelers. To some extent, it also offered a luxury that passengers had never seen before.

But on the 25th of April, 2005, the Airbus A380 took flight for the first time.

It challenged the Queen Of The Skies in a market it simply had dominated for almost 40 years at that time.

The A380 brought luxury and comfort to the next level. A hotel in the sky, a bar, a spa – the list goes on, but the point is, the A380 offers an unprecedented level of luxury onboard.

With the Super Jumbo, as the aircraft is nicknamed, Airbus managed to build an aircraft that every aviation enthusiast, every traveler, every person on this planet wishes to travel on. Okay, the last one might be a bit of an exaggeration, but you get the point I‘m making!

Thus, this is the third reason.

Nobody is perfect

But as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of Airbus, we need to remember that nobody is perfect. While the manufacturer certainly influenced the way we travel, some decisions are very questionable.

For example, the fact that barely any Airbus aircraft fly with cargo airlines indicates that their planes have a fairly short lifespan compared to Boeing‘s aircraft, which are easily converted into freighters.

Some of the aircraft decisions were shocking as well – the Airbus A340 was a failure, as for some reason Airbus thought that the future of long-haul was with quad-engine aircraft. The Boeing 777, which came out two years later, proved that Airbus was very wrong. As of 2019, the 777 outsells the A340 by 5 times and Boeing still produces their jet.

Nevertheless, when you sum up the 50 years of Airbus – the overall lookout is very positive. The Airbus name carries a lot of respect in the aviation industry.

So much so, that the CEO of their biggest competitor, Boeing, has congratulated them on this anniversary:","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9364021420478821}",negative,0.9364021420478821,-1

Airbus pushes 10-abreast A350 beyond leisure/charter markets - Runway Girl Network,"Mon, 27 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTkvMDUvYWlyYnVzLXB1c2hlcy0xMC1hYnJlYXN0LWEzNTAtYmV5b25kLWxlaXN1cmUtY2hhcnRlci1tYXJrZXRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Having told Runway Girl Network in 2015 that it is working to make the 10-abreast A350 XWB more comfortable, Airbus now confirms it has advanced its efforts to decrease the discomfort of the high-density configuration on its now flagship twinjet.

The news was delivered by new chief commercial officer Christian Scherer last week during the company’s Innovation Days press event at its French headquarters outside Toulouse.

“Now, yes, the A350-1000 is the largest model we can offer,” Scherer said in response to a question regarding the demise of the A380. “It is a model that offers absolutely unparalleled economics and productivity to our customers. I don’t know if, on this visit, you all will get a chance to look at the cabin mockup that we have on this airplane. With an enhanced cabin you can very comfortably go to 10-abreast seating in economy class on this airplane for long-range flying, and therefore offer — I use the adjective again, unmatched — capabilities to our airline customers.”

For passengers, it is hard to see this development as any sort of positive. The A350’s cabin is narrower than the Boeing 777, and in previous years, Airbus cited 16.4” as the standard seat width for 10-abreast seating on the A350.

So far, 10-abreast A350 operators are entirely in the leisure/charter market: French hybrid-LCCs Air Caraïbes and Frenchbee, for example. Essentially, these operators are the kind of airline that is or would be already operating ultra-narrow nine-abreast seats on the A300/A310/A330/A340 fuselage. And that has certainly been the line Airbus has traditionally taken: airlines don’t need to make the A350 seats as narrow as the Boeing 777’s, and 10-abreast will remain very much the exception.

Indeed, in 2015, Airbus executive VP, strategy and marketing Dr. Kiran Rao admitted that while airlines can get away with offering a seat width of 17″ or less on longhaul flights of 12 to 14 hours, and “people will put up with it”, the configuration is far from ideal and “it’s simply not comfortable”.

It was thus with much surprise that Runway Girl Network and some 130 journalists heard Scherer refer to a new cabin mockup, and suggest that a 10-abreast A350 layout would be comfortable – a marked change of approach and messaging for the airframer as it seeks to compete at the upper end of the capacity spectrum in the future absence of the A380.

With the trend of slimming the sidewalls, shrinking the armrests and re-measuring the seat pan, the airframer is eyeing seat width of 17” for the 10-abreast A350. This compares to the A350’s standard 9-abreast layout with 18” wide seats.

Journalists did not get a chance to look at the cabin mockup, and Airbus clammed up about the entire thing. When RGN requested a follow-up interview and further information during and after the Innovation Days, Airbus initially promised an interview but later decided to decline to comment, although executives knew what this journalist was talking about when asking questions about the new approach.

RGN understands that the work to present this potential densification is already underway.

One imagines that what would be some of the narrowest seats ever to be installed on a commercial airliner would indeed offer “unparalleled economics”, to quote Scherer. But to say this could be carried out “very comfortably” warrants further clarification from Airbus.

Previous densification of otherwise comfortable aircraft have not proven successful for the airframer. In 2015, Airbus attempted to drum up support for an 11-abreast row densification exercise on the Airbus A380 that ended up with wobbly ultra-thin armrests, window seats where passengers weren’t able to put their feet on the floor, and which was roundly panned by observers, passengers and ever-hopeful lessors on first sight.

Indeed, it could be argued that this effort poisoned the well for further densification efforts on the A380, including the airframer’s “cabin enablers” and A380plus projects, hastening the eventual demise of the superjumbo.

Turning the A380 brand from “unbeatable passenger experience” to ‘just as awful or even worse as everything else’ was not a winner then, and it does not sound like a winner to do so with the A350.

Mirroring sister brand Airbus Corporate Jets (ACJ), ACH provides an exclusive end-to-end ownership experience from first enquiry and ordering, through in-service support, to enhanced resale opportunities.

ACH delivers the highest standards in safety, technology, craftsmanship and service and is backed by HCareFirst – a premium support service aimed directly at the specific needs of operators typically recording low flight-hours but demanding worry-free aircraft availability when required.

Frederic Lemos, Head of ACH, said: “This substantial new business for the ACH160 even before certification is clearly demonstrating its very high level of acceptance in the market. These firm orders from highly knowledgeable customers are concrete evidence that the aircraft is addressing the needs of the most demanding operators.”

The full ACH helicopter range consists of the ACH125, ACH130, ACH135, new ACH145, ACH160 and ACH175 variants of Airbus Helicopters’ comprehensive and market-leading family of light and medium models. A range of premium-design aircraft completions, including bespoke solutions, is available for all models.

Renowned for its combination of versatility and comfort, the ACH range of helicopters is admired by passengers and pilots alike for its stylish interiors, smooth and quiet ride allied to its technologically advanced Helionix digital avionics system ensuring carefree handling and the highest level of safety.

As the European aviation leader turned 50 Wednesday, cloudy skies prevented a planned air pageant, mirroring the company’s deeper difficulties.

Airbus had planned to mark its 50th birthday Wednesday with a flypast for staff at its Toulouse headquarters. Six jets, spanning the European aviation giant’s commercial line, were scheduled to fly over the base escorted by the ‘French Patrol’ (Patrouille de France), the aerobatic display team of the French Air Force.

But cloudy weather forced the European aviation giant to cancel its air show at the last minute, company officials said. It’s perhaps a fitting turn of events for the already scaled-down fiftieth anniversary celebration. The company’s plans to hold a private event stood in stark contrast to past fanfare.

A moment of turbulence for Europe’s champion of the skies

Europe’s jetmaker was launched at a meeting between French and West German ministers on May 29, 1969, in a bid to revive struggling aircraft industries and seal post-war reconciliation.

After battling to overcome American domination of the commercial market with its A300 twin-aisle jet, which first flew in 1972, Airbus eventually became a globally recognised symbol of European industrial might.

50 years of Making It Fly all stemmed from this. These signatures in 1969 led to the #A300 programme, the world's first twin-engine wide body airliner. Ever since we've continued pioneering flight in the skies & beyond. https://t.co/vKs2YZncrj #Airbus50 #WeMakeItFly pic.twitter.com/pvKTh2MD54 Airbus (@Airbus) 29 mai 2019

Today, an Airbus takes off every 2.5 seconds worldwide, and the company has sufficient orders to keep its production lines busy for the next ten years.

But as it turns 50, Airbus is embroiled in soul-searching and a management upheaval amid an ongoing corruption investigation. The shakeup has led to cost-cutting measures that saw the budget for Wednesday’s celebrations slashed long before clouds gathered. Airbus’s plans for a private event stood in stark contrast to a lavish gathering of heads of state and hundreds of journalists in 2005 to mark the launch of the world’s largest airliner, the A380, which is now being axed due to weak demand.

Poor sales of the A380 contributed to Boeing overtaking Airbus in orders last year for the first time since 2012, although the US jetmaker’s gain has since been overshadowed by the scandal surrounding its 737 Max model. Two of the planes have crashed since last October, killing 346 people and prompting aviation authorities to ground dozens of the planes worldwide.

Boeing’s difficulties have presented an opening for its European rival, and its chief executive Guillaume Faury sounded a note of optimism at a Toulouse press conference last week.

“Today, Airbus produces half of all large commercial planes in the world,” and the company’s production of helicopters and defense aircraft is “flourishing”, he said. “We employ 130,000 highly qualified people internationally and we are a powerful engine of productivity, exports and innovation for Europe.”

“The aviation industry is on the verge of an unprecedented technological revolution,” he continued, citing artificial intelligence and the electrification of planes. “European aerospace should aspire to lead this coming revolution in terms of innovation and the transition toward a more sustainable aviation sector.”

Faury also paid tribute to past generations of Airbus employees.

“It’s fair to say that many people doubted our chances of success but here we still are 50 years and 12,000 commercial aircraft later,” he told reporters.

Legacy of another era in Europe

Airbus is a unique powerhouse of European industry, the living legacy of a moment when French and German priorities aligned to create a global market leader.

“The idea was to pool expertise in a single project. They had to fight the reticent impulses of national governments that were not yet sure if they wanted to co-operate politically,” said Nicola Clark, author of Airbus: The first 50 years.

“The Franco-German relationship ... eventually became the core of Airbus,” she said. Britain and Spain also joined early on.

A recent initiative to create an analog for rail through the merger of Alstom and Siemens was scuttled by European regulators in February. The EU’s antitrust commissioner said the mega-merger would have run afoul of the bloc’s competition regulations, creating a near monopoly in the European market and pushing up prices for passengers.

The decision dashed French and German hopes for a new European industrial champion to rival China's state-controlled giant CRRC, which is set to extend its reach into Europe through the country’s Belt and Road Initiative. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the EU’s decision would “serve the economic and industrial interests of China”.

China is also investing heavily in its state-owned aircraft manufacturer, Comac, in a bid to break the current Airbus-Boeing duopoly. But analysts say that a serious challenge to the two companies’ dominance is still a long way off.

Germany becomes first government customer for ACJ350 - Airbus,"Mon, 20 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wNS1nZXJtYW55LWJlY29tZXMtZmlyc3QtZ292ZXJubWVudC1jdXN0b21lci1mb3ItYWNqMzUw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The German government has placed a firm order for three ACJ350-900 XWBs, becoming the first government customer for the type, which has already been ordered by private customers.

The aircraft are destined for a mix of government, troop transport and medical evacuation roles. Delivery of the first aircraft is planned for 2020, and the other two in 2022.

Cabin outfitting will be facilitated by ACJ’s Easyfit cabin-outfitting concept, which features pre-installed attachments and standardized interfaces that greatly simplify installing walls and furniture in a carbonfibre fuselage.

“The ACJ350 XWB is the ultimate in modern, long-haul, private jet travel, with the capability to deliver large groups nonstop to the world in unmatched comfort, efficiency and reliability,” says ACJ President Benoit Defforge.

The A350 XWB is the first Airbus aircraft to feature a carbonfibre fuselage and wings, which are immune to fatigue and corrosion, as well as saving weight.

Its technological features also include the greater comfort of a lower cabin-altitude, simpler and faster transition-training for pilots through the newest version of Airbus’s common cockpit, and aerodynamically efficient wings that adapt their shape in flight.

Total A350 XWB orders stand at around 900, more than 250 of which are already in airline service.

The ACJ350-900 XWB can fly 25 passengers 11,100 nm/20,550 km or more than 22 hours in its ultra-long range version.

Around 200 Airbus corporate jets are in service worldwide, flying on every continent, including Antarctica.

Airbus was formed on this day back in 1969 when the French Minister of Transport, Jean Chamant and the German Minister of Economic Affairs, Karl Schiller signed an agreement to develop the A300.

The first Airbus model was also the world’s first wide-body, twin-engine airliner designed for medium-haul travel. The name actually derived from Airbus’ intention for it to seat 300 passengers – during development, that passenger count had to be lowered to 250 but the name stuck and has since been used to form the name of all future Airbus models (with exception of the A220, of course, but we can excuse that little hiccup).

While Airbus was initially created as a joint project between the French and German governments, the Brits later joined the party and now parts for various Airbus models are manufactured across Europe. The company’s headquarters may well be in Toulouse but the aircraft manufacturer supports hundreds of thousands of jobs across the Continent.

And as Airbus has grown so has it’s presence – there are also manufacturing plants in both the United States and China.

It’s always a close call as to whether Airbus or Boeing is leading the race for customers and Boeing has certainly won more orders than Airbus in recent years – but as we’ve seen with the 737 MAX woes, life is full of unexpected turns.

Airbus has been careful not to gloat at Boeing’s misfortunes – especially in light of the human tragedy. But it also looks like there is some real respect between the aerospace giants. Boeing has even created a special video congratulating Airbus on its birthday, telling its biggest competitor “we’re glad you’re here”.

The video is… unusual but it does follow in a tradition of sorts between the two rivals.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998506307601929}",neutral,0.9998506307601929,0

Airbus notes that since the entry into service of the A220, almost three years ago, the aircraft has performed up to advertised standards and in some cases exceeded them.

Using the latest advances in engineering and the clean-sheet, digital design of the aircraft, Airbus was able to make use of structural and system margins, as well as making better use of fuel systems.

With 530 aircraft on order, Airbus expects the A220 will win the majority of the predicted 7000 aircraft required for the 100-150 seat market.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9980049729347229}",positive,0.9980049729347229,1

Airbus A380: Success Despite Business Failure? - One Mile at a Time,"Wed, 22 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLXN1Y2Nlc3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This February we learned that production of the Airbus A380 will end in 2021. As of February, Airbus only planned on building another 17 A380s, including three that are going to ANA, and 14 that are going to Emirates.

The A380: was there even demand?

With the huge global increase in air travel, it’s on one hand surprising to see that the A380 has been such a flop. While Emirates has loved the plane, no other airline has embraced it.

Emirates A380

You’d think there would be a fair amount of demand for the A380, given that the plane has significantly lower per passenger operating costs than the 747, and back in the day that plane ruled the skies.

The problem is that the A380 was introduced around the same time as the 787 and only years before the A350, which are long range, lower capacity, fuel efficient aircraft. Airlines ultimately decided that they’d rather operate smaller planes that are easier to fill with good yields, rather than buying planes this big.

What I’m still conflicted about is whether the A380 was a plane for which there was never demand, or if it was simply a plane before its time. With airports getting increasingly congested, is the issue just that the world wasn’t ready for the A380? Would there have been demand for this plane in a decade?

No one really knows, though I guess we’ll see if we ever see another “double decker” plane, or the 777X is the biggest jet that airlines will want going forward.

Airbus lost a lot of money on the A380

Airbus most definitely lost money on the A380, though we don’t quite know how much. Their development costs upfront were somewhere in the range of 17-25 billion USD.

Then when it came to production costs, Airbus allegedly only barely broke even. So it’s safe to say that Airbus lost a lot of money on the A380, though we don’t know how many billions.

Why Airbus claims the A380 was a success

Airbus lost billions of dollars on the A380, and production ended much sooner than they were expecting. Yet Airbus’ new CEO claims that the plane was a success.

Some might think he’s just trying to put a positive spin on it, but I actually think there might be some merit to what’s he’s saying.

As Leeham explains, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury claims the A380 was a success because it paved the way for Airbus’ successful development and production of the A350, and the transformation of Airbus as a company into what it is today.

In 2006 Airbus had problems with the final assembly of the A380, which exposed problems between the French and German plants where the A380 was produced. The two plants used different versions of a program to create the plane’s wiring, and when they put it together, it was a few inches short.

This disaster led to a delay of nearly 18 months for the plane being put into service.

Airbus believes that if it weren’t for this snafu, the same problems would have happened with A350 production. The A350 has been a huge success for Airbus, with nearly 900 sales of the plane so far. All things considered production of the plane has been smooth, and they credit much of what they learned from the A380 for that.

Malaysia Airlines A350

Beyond that, I do think there’s something to be said for the fact that the A380 gave Airbus a lot of credibility, both among consumers and among airlines. It showed what a versatile plane maker they are (they can building everything from an A220 to an A380), and it has been a favorite among customers.

Back in the day Boeing had more market share than Airbus, but Airbus has come a long way, even if the project didn’t pan out to be as popular as they had hoped.

High in the Austrian Alps - Airbus,"Wed, 29 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE5LTA1LWhpZ2gtaW4tdGhlLWF1c3RyaWFuLWFscHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Article: Heather Couthaud - Photos: Airbus Helicopters/Anthony Pechi. Article adapted from Rotor magazine #115.

Over the past 18 years, Heli Austria has expanded their fleet of Airbus helicopters for HEMS, heliskiing and aerial work.

“When you grow fast as a company, you hire guys with outside experience, but they still need training for this area because it’s special. Weather, geography… it’s the same air but the whole thing around you is special.”

Roy Knaus is talking about flying in the Austrian Alps, where his company Heli Austria, a multi-mission helicopter operator, is based. Knaus is the second-generation owner and CEO of Heli Austria after his father, Johann Knaus, founded the company in 1982 in St. Johann im Pongau, 35 miles south of Salzburg. In 1997, Roy took over the business, acquired additional bases throughout and beyond the borders of Austria, and gradually expanded the fleet to its present 30 helicopters.

Multi-mission

Under Roy’s watch, the company branched into different types of operations. “We try to be progressive and forward thinking, and see where we can find our market opportunities,” he says. In winter, helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS), avalanche blasting, heliskiing and sightseeing keep them busy; in other seasons, the fleet adds utility work, long-line and sling operations, and firefighting to their roster. Most recently, they sent two H125s and one H130 to Iceland for heliskiing and sightseeing tours.

In summer, Heli Austria will deploy an AS355 to meet a demand for twin-engine, multi-mission capability in Iceland. This is one of the operator’s strengths: a large portfolio of helicopters to meet a range of needs. Their most recent acquisitions include ten H125s, two H130s and in November 2019, their first H145.

“The performance of the H125 is very good and so is its total usability as a utility platform. It is a stable aircraft for aerial work and logging. The H130 is better for passenger transport, with a better experience for passengers,” says Knaus. The H145 in its turn will complement the twin-engine members of the fleet.

The performance of the H125 is very good and so is its total usability as a utility platform.

- Roy Knaus, CEO of Heli Austria.

Special equipment

“We have our own design organisation because we make minor changes and STCs so we can adapt the helicopters to what we need operationally,” says Knaus. Such modifications include upgrading four repurposed Super Pumas with new Garmin equipment and long line releases for utility work, and certifying the fleet with tactical radios. “Safety is important for us, so our helicopters have cable cutters, a lot have UMS systems, and we ordered our new aircraft with crash-resistant fuel tanks. Airbus offers a retrofit kit, so we ordered the retrofit for our other aircraft, too.”

Firefighting

Where: Sardinia

When: summer



Mission: In 2016, Heli Austria acquired four H215 Super Pumas which they converted for heavylift aerial work and firefighting. “In 2016, we deployed the Super Puma to Sardinia for firefighting, and in the meantime we have received a three-year contract with the island. The Sardinia customer liked the performance of the Super Puma, especially with the big Bambi bucket carrying 4,000 litres of water. With its fuel consumption, it can stay on the fire about three hours. And with its speed, it arrives quite quickly to the fire.”

Heliskiing

Where: Iceland

When: winter



Mission: “Heliskiing usually involves several groups of people per helicopter. One group is up to four people plus the guide,” says Knaus. “The helicopter needs a ski basket and bear paws [on the skids]. The pilots have a lot of different spots on the mountain where they bring the group. When they’re on the top of the mountain, the helicopter descends and waits. There are some places where it is close to the sea, which is a very special element about the heliskiing in Iceland. Another specialty is you get very long days in summer, so customers want to enjoy the skiing as much as possible.”

Snow blasting

Where: Austria

When: Winter



Mission: “In January 2019, we had a lot of snow in a short period. We had so much snow that the trees were hanging into the roads and in order to be able to open roads, we were washing the snow off the trees with the downwash from the helicopters. We did that for power lines; we did it for the railroad companies, because they were in danger of closing the railroads. We did it for ski resorts, because all the trees were hanging into the trails. One day, we had three Super Pumas flying, and another day, 20 helicopters were flying from our total fleet. We flew close to 500 flight hours within one week.”

These helicopters are the first two in a series of seven H125s ordered by Helitrans to be delivered with fully digital logcards. They will be used for a wide range of missions that cover powerline construction and firefighting, as well as sightseeing trips, passenger transport, photography and telecom network development.

A logcard is a document that tracks the entire maintenance history of critical helicopter parts, from manufacture all along their in-service lives. The digital logcard replaces outdated paper logcards, prone to loss and error, with digital content stored in a secured cloud. Airbus Helicopters first unveiled its digital logcards in March 2019, becoming the first helicopter manufacturer on the market to transform paper logcards into easy-to-use digital data.

“We welcome this innovative approach to logcard management, which is fully in line with Helitran's vision of digitising and simplifying processes within the company,” said Per Erik Nesvold, director of maintenance at Helitrans.

“Since April 2019, we’ve been progressively offering customers taking delivery of a new Airbus civil helicopter the option of receiving digital logcards,” said Jean-Michel Arlhac, project leader for digital logcards at Airbus Helicopters. “We’re thankful for Helitrans’ confidence in our new digital means and look forward to receiving their valuable feedback in the months to come.”

Helitrans has been operating the H125 for almost thirty years from its bases around Norway. It is one of the largest helicopter companies in Norway and one of the top 30 civil operators in Europe. With these seven new H125s, Helitrans fleet will consist of 22 Airbus H125 and H130 helicopters.

The H125 and H130 lead the single-engine helicopter market, accounting for almost 70% of deliveries in the last five years. The Ecureuil fleet is composed of 5,000 helicopters in service with some 1,900 operators across the globe and it has accumulated more than 30 million flight hours.

Could Airbus Build An A300neo To Compete With The 797? - Simple Flying,"Thu, 02 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9haXJidXMtYTMwMG5lby_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,,"{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998784065246582}",neutral,0.9998784065246582,0
Airbus A320neo family fuel burn numbers | - AirInsight,"Wed, 29 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vYWlyaW5zaWdodC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWEzMjBuZW8tZmFtaWx5LWZ1ZWwtYnVybi1udW1iZXJzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Care to share?

Yesterday we reported fuel burn numbers which we called “preliminary”. Today we got confirmation that Spirit Airlines refiled their numbers for 2017, so now we have final numbers.

For some time we have been eager to see how the A320neo family engines compare on fuel burn. Now we have a clear comparison, with the airlines having selected one engine type per fleet. The formerly Virgin America fleet now operates under the Alaska Airlines brand. Along with that fleet, the Frontier Airlines fleet is CFM LEAP powered. The Hawaiian and Spirit fleet is P&W GTF powered. We are certain the engine makers are pouring over the same data today.

What did we find?

The neo models do have better fuel burn than the ceo models: For 2018 the A320neo was 9.3% better than the A320, and the A321neo was 10.1% better than the A321. Not near the ~15% expected. The global data is possibly too messy to provide the kind of improvements everyone has been expecting. So let’s break it down.

Looking at the two airlines with the optimal data for A320ceo/neo comparison, Spirit and Frontier, we find the following.

The CFM powered A320neo at Frontier in 2018 were at $10 per seat hour in fuel costs compared to $11 per seat/hour to the GTF powered Spirit fleet.

For 2018, at Frontier, the LEAP engines had 16.7% better fuel burn/seat/hour than the CFM56. For Spirit, the GTF engines were 15.4% better than the V2500.

Next, let’s look at the A321ceo/neo numbers.

This chart combines data for Virgin America and Alaska. In 2018 the A321neo (CFM LEAP) showed a 29.4% improvement in fuel burn per seat over the A321ceo (CFM56). To further illustrate the improvement in the A321neo, Hawaiian Airlines’ A321neo fleet (P&W GTF) generated a remarkable $10 per seat/hour in fuel burn for 2018. This is due to Hawaiian using the A321neo in a more optimal fashion than any other airline with long stages which is ideal to demonstrate its capabilities.

To provide a guide of just how much fuel burn/seat/hour can vary, here is a table showing A321ceo numbers.

Stage lengths are a big driver, but then so is seat count. Spirit has 228 seats compared to between 185 and 190 on Alaska. We will continue to update our models as new data is published. Subscribers can access the data model to run comparisons.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9990948438644409}",positive,0.9990948438644409,1
How Airbus Helicopters maintained lift | Paid content | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Tue, 28 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWF0LTUwL2hvdy1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtbWFpbnRhaW5lZC1saWZ0LzEzMjQ0My5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Like much of the aeronautical industry, the slow evolution of Airbus Helicopters can be traced back to the early days of powered flight. Pioneering companies across both France and Germany slowly merged and coalesced – sometimes through pure economic decisions, sometimes with state direction – eventually transforming into a single entity.

Of course, this being rotary-wing aviation, the story is not that simple. While there were plenty of early innovators experimenting with vertical lift who paved the way for what came later – Talleres Loring, a Spanish autogyro manufacturer from the 1920s, is the earliest of Airbus Helicopters’ ancestors – mass helicopter production did not really begin until the 1950s.

EC135 – pictured on maiden sortie – uses rigid rotor system developed since 1950s

Airbus Helicopters

In fact, for many years, most of the manufacturer’s predecessors concentrated on the production of fixed-wing fighters and bombers. For example, in 1936, nationalisation of French industry created the Societe Nationale de Constructions Aeronautiques du Sud-Ouest (Sud-Ouest) by merging six aviation companies, including Bleriot and Bloch, building the Bretagne transport, Vautour bomber and Trident fighter.

Similarly, Societe Nationale de Constructions Aeronautiques du Sud-Est (Sud-Est) brought together a cluster of Provencal aerospace companies – CAMS, Liore et Olivier, Potez and SPCA in and around Marseille, and Romano in Cannes – producing an array of fighters and bombers.

Indeed, pictures from 1939 of the Sud-Est plant in Marignane – now the location of Airbus Helicopters’ headquarters – show rows of fixed-wing aircraft parked outside the assembly facility.

Twin-engined Bolkow Bo105 made its debut in 1967

Airbus Helicopters

Experimentation with rotary-wing flight had not finished, though: Sud-Est, via the absorption of Liore et Olivier, was researching autogyro designs, having previously licence-built the Cierva C.30.

And in Germany, Heinrich Focke, having been removed from the Focke-Wulf company he co-founded, teamed up in 1937 with pilot Gerd Achgelis to form a new business specialising in helicopter production.

That company, Focke-Achgelis, built on the work carried out on the record-breaking Focke-Wulf Fw 61, and created the Fa 223 Drache, of which around 20 were built.

The Drache – Dragon, in English – also played a key part in ushering in post-war collaboration between France and Germany on helicopter development, with Heinrich Focke in 1947 joining Sud-Est to assist in the design of its Fa 223-based SE.3000.

But the real catalyst for the growth of the helicopter industry came in the 1950s with the arrival of the turbine engine.

In France, Sud-Est and Sud-Ouest – which merged in 1957 to form Sud Aviation – and Bolkow in Germany all made use of the new engine technology being brought to market by Turbomeca (now Safran Helicopter Engines) to power helicopters that were suddenly much more capable than those that had gone before.

Powered by a single Artouste turboshaft, the Alouette II first flew in March 1955, and by June that year had already set a new altitude record for helicopters (26,900ft). The Alouette II was the first serially produced turbine-powered helicopter and remained a cornerstone of the range until 1975, well into the Aerospatiale era.

Of course, technological innovation was not confined to the engine makers – it has been a constant at both the French and German businesses that later became Airbus Helicopters.

However, for all the recent advances in materials and manufacturing, two of the most significant inventions have been around for as long as Airbus itself.

In fact, both innovations – the hingeless, rigid rotor and the Fenestron shrouded tail rotor – slightly predate Airbus, having made their debut flights in the years before 1969.

First flight of a Fenestron shrouded tail rotor was on second prototype of SA340 Gazelle

Airbus Helicopters

Work on the Bolkow-designed rotor system began in the 1950s, and in another early demonstration of Franco-German co-operation, was matured for over 1,000 flight hours aboard an Alouette II.

That rigid rotor system then went on to equip the Bolkow Bo105, which made its maiden sortie in early 1967. Writing that year, Flight International pointed to the “minimum drag” from the simplified rotor head and inherent “stability” of the design, also noting that it was “distinctly less noisy than the average helicopter design”; development costs for the rotor system were given as DM10 million (over £900,000).

“Meanwhile, work is proceeding on a titanium rotor head which will be some 150lb [68kg] lighter and run on elastomeric bearings which will require no maintenance,” the article noted.

A development of that original rotor design now equips the H135 (which started life as the Bo108) and will be fitted to the H145 from 2020.

Around a year after the Bo105 took to the air, on 12 April 1968, Sud Aviation performed the first flight of a Fenestron shrouded tail rotor aboard the second prototype of the SA340 Gazelle.

Invented by Paul Fabre and Rene Mouille – and originally called the Fenestrou, “little window” in Provencal dialect – the shrouded design was intended to provide additional safeguards for workers on the ground, and to offer protection for the tail rotor when operating in challenging environments.

Although Flight International in 1969 noted that the “buried” tail rotor had proved “more difficult than expected”, the Fenestron has been refined over the years – moving to a second-generation, all-composite design at the end of the 1970s, and a third iteration in 1994. With each change, the system has been optimised for power and sound reduction.

It equips several of the manufacturer’s iconic light and medium helicopters, including the H130, H135, H145, and both the AS365 and H155 variants of the Dauphin.

The latest iteration of the Fenestron will make its commercial debut in 2020 on the H160 medium-twin, which at 1.2m (3.9ft) diameter, is also the largest to date.

H160, launched in 2015, has benefited from processes shared across the group

L Horgan/Airbus Helicopters

Those developments and their intertwined applications are also illustrative of the continued industrial consolidation on either side of the Rhine.

State-owned Sud Aviation – formed from the merger of Sud-Est and Sud-Ouest – became Aerospatiale with the addition on Nord Aviation and SEREB in 1970. And in Germany, Messerschmitt and Bolkow joined together in 1968, adding Hamburger Flugzeugbau, the aviation division of Blohm und Voss, the following year to form Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm (MBB). In 1980, that conglomeration gained VFW – the ultimate successor to Focke-Achgelis. Nine years later, MBB was integrated into Deutsche Aerospace.

This industrial concentration, of course, paved the way for the creation of Eurocopter on 1 January 1992. Although that was the official start date of the merged company, a marketing consortium – Eurocopter International – was up and running the previous year, an agreement on its creation having been signed in April 1990.

Interestingly, at the time, an even more comprehensive consolidation was contemplated, with the then-separate Agusta and Westland businesses also considered for inclusion.

But, speaking in the 15-21 May 1991 edition of Flight International, the airframer’s co-chairman Jean-Francois Bigay noted: “We must first ensure the good working of Eurocopter before seeking other European partners.”

As Flight put it, Eurocopter’s creation was a means to “enable the European companies to withstand fierce competition from rivals like Bell Helicopter and McDonnell Douglas Helicopters”.

At that point, the company had a combined turnover of $1.78 billion (around $3.32 billion today) with a joint market share outside the US and Soviet military segments of 41% over the 1985-1989 period.

By comparison, sales last year were a shade under €6 billion ($6.73 billion) and its share of the global civil and parapublic market was 54%, ahead of Leonardo (21%) and Bell (12%).

However, there is only so much that can be done to tackle the dominance of Russian and US companies in the military segment (arguably not helped by the struggles of some of its own programmes such as the Tiger and NH Industries NH90 with budgets and deadlines).

Although there was some resistance to the adoption in 2014 of the Airbus Helicopters name – signalling a deeper integration with the rest of the group – that has largely dissipated.

On reflection, Eurocopter – the name, not the company – suggested a certain parochiality, whereas Airbus Helicopters is very much an international creature: it has a presence in around 30 countries, with manufacturing operations in Australia, Brazil, and the USA – and recently opened a new assembly facility for the H135 in China.

Explaining the rationale for the change, then-Airbus Helicopters chief executive Guillaume Faury (now, of course, in charge of the entire Airbus group), said it was not just a “new name or brand” but represented a change going “to the very core of our DNA”.

The intertwining with Airbus has also enabled processes and practices to be shared across the group. That is reflected in the H160 medium-twin – dubbed “the first of the H generation” at its 2015 launch – which, aside from its standard Airbus livery, is produced using methods adopted from the fixed-wing world.

Indeed, the change of aircraft designation unveiled at the time – dropping the EC prefix – also fits within that ethos. “It’s extremely simple – in Airbus the A is for airliners and H is for helicopters,” said Faury.

Meanwhile, Airbus Helicopters continues to battle a challenging market under the leadership of chief executive Bruno Even.

That situation means that competitors are “very aggressive”, he told Flight in late 2018, and customers are “more and more demanding” while “requiring excellence from the OEM”, all of which means the transformation started by Faury must continue.

“At the same time, we are still optimistic about the mid- and long-term in the helicopter market,” he said.

“So yes, today we are facing a difficult market – it has been declining since two or four years – but I’m really convinced it’s an opportunity for Airbus Helicopters, as long as we are launching the right transformation.”

Part of that transformation includes research and technology activities, including the development of the Racer high-speed technology demonstrator. With its V-wings, pusher props and a main rotor, it looks unique and, if successful, could usher in a new era of vertical flight.

Also currently in its early stages is the electrically-powered CityAirbus urban air mobility project, which will use four pairs of ducted fans to transport up to four people on short intra-city journeys.

Quite what the sector’s early pioneers would make of the futuristic-looking CityAirbus is debatable. Although they would likely embrace the spirit of innovation, they would also be re-assured by one familiar aspect of the design: its eight propellers are all made of wood.

Launch of the second SpaceDataHighway satellite - Airbus,"Mon, 06 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wNS1sYXVuY2gtb2YtdGhlLXNlY29uZC1zcGFjZWRhdGFoaWdod2F5LXNhdGVsbGl0ZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"@AirbusSpace

6 May 2019 – The EDRS-C satellite, the second node of the SpaceDataHighway network (also known as EDRS), will be launched into geostationary orbit at 31° East on 24 July 2019 by an Ariane 5 launcher. Once positioned above Europe, it will provide redundant back-up for the SpaceDataHighway system, double transmission capacity and be able to relay the data from two observation satellites simultaneously.

This second satellite will be joining EDRS-A which transmits on a daily basis the images of Earth acquired by the Copernicus programme’s four Sentinel observation satellites. Since it entered service in late 2016, it has achieved more than 20,000 laser connections. The reliability rate has reached 99.5%, and these successful connections have downloaded more than 1 petabyte of data.

“This milestone in the SpaceDataHighway represents a significant step forward in terms of capability. It’s an exciting time to see the next generation of secure connectivity develop,” said Evert Dudok, Head of Communications, Intelligence & Security at Airbus Defence and Space.

The SpaceDataHighway is the world’s first ‘optical fibre’ network in the sky based on cutting-edge laser technology. It is a unique network of geostationary satellites permanently fixed over a network of ground stations that can transmit data at a rate of 1.8 Gbit/s.

SpaceDataHighway satellites can connect to low-orbiting observation satellites at a distance up to 45000 km, intelligence UAVs or mission aircraft via laser. From its position in geostationary orbit, the SpaceDataHighway system relays data collected by observation satellites to Earth in near-real-time, a process that would normally take several hours. It thus enables the quantity of image and video data transmitted by observation satellites to be tripled and their mission plan to be reprogrammed at any time and in just a few minutes.

A third communication node is to be positioned over the Asia-Pacific region by around 2024. Equipped with three laser terminals, EDRS-D will significantly increase the system’s communication capacity and considerably expand its coverage.

From 2021, the Pleiades Neo Earth observation satellites will begin to use the SpaceDataHighway. As of 2019, the system will also provide a fully European broadband communication service to the Columbus module of the International Space Station (ISS).

The SpaceDataHighway is a public–private partnership between the European Space Agency (ESA) and Airbus, with the laser terminals developed by Tesat-Spacecom and the DLR German Space Administration. Airbus owns, operates and provides commercial services for the SpaceDataHighway. The EDRS-C satellite platform supplied by OHB System AG will also be carrying a payload from Avanti Communications.

Two A350-900s will be leased from Dubai-based DAE Capital, making Fiji Airways the newest operator and DAE Capital the latest customer.

With its common type rating with the A330 Family, the A350 XWB was the natural aircraft choice to seamlessly join the airline’s existing fleet of four A330s. The common rating between the A350 XWB and A330 means that pilots who are qualified and current on the A330 can already commence preparations to take the A350 XWB’s controls by undergoing “differences training” only, meaning a significant cost savings and operational flexibility.

The aircraft will be configured with 33 full lie-flat Business Class and 301 Economy Class seats. The aircraft will be deployed to enhance existing long-haul services between Fiji, Australia and the U.S., and to provide the opportunity to open additional routes.

The A350 XWB is the world’s most modern and eco-efficient aircraft family shaping the future of air travel. It is the long-range leader in the large widebody market (300 to 400+ seats). The A350 XWB offers by design unrivalled operational flexibility and efficiency for all market segments up to ultra-long haul (9,700 nm). It features the latest aerodynamic design, carbon fibre fuselage and wings, plus new fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce engines. Together, these latest technologies translate into unrivalled levels of operational efficiency, with a 25% reduction in fuel burn and emissions. The A350 XWB’s Airspace by Airbus cabin is the quietest of any twin-aisle and offers passengers and crews the most modern in-flight products for the most comfortable flying experience. At the end of March 2019, the A350 XWB Family had received 890 firm orders from 50 customers worldwide, making it one of the most successful widebody aircraft ever.

An interview with Tom Williams | Paid content | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Tue, 28 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWF0LTUwL2FuLWludGVydmlldy13aXRoLXRvbS13aWxsaWFtcy8xMzI0MTMuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus veteran Tom Williams, who retired at the end of 2018 after two decades in the management team, gives his perspective on some of the company’s key achievements

Tom Williams stepped away from Airbus at the end of 2018 as chief operating officer, having had a front-seat view during a crucial period in its history. Williams helped oversee key programmes including the A380, A350, A400M, and both “Neos” – A320 and A330. And there was also the small matter of helping mastermind the production ramp-up to levels which, in his own words, would at one time be considered “madness”.

“Tom braved countless challenges, always overcoming them in the best interest of the company and its customers, and never losing his dry Scottish humour,” said Airbus group chief executive Tom Enders ahead of his retirement in 2018.

Williams led an unprecedented output hike

Airbus

Williams, who began his career at Rolls-Royce in 1969, joined Airbus from BAE Systems in 2000 as managing director of its UK arm, and quickly got tasked with managing wing development for the A380. He then headed across the Channel in 2004 to join the Toulouse management team as head of procurement in 2004. From 2006, Williams spent a decade heading programmes and customer services, with a final three years as COO.

As Airbus marks 50 years, Williams is incredibly well placed for a narrative on some of its greatest achievements – as well as some less auspicious ones. But one feat he and his peers are rightly proud of is the transformation of Airbus from a consortium of national aerospace companies into a consolidated business capable of taking on the might of Boeing.

“We’d gone from what was a combined European company with 11% market share to get to 50% and giving Boeing real competition,” says Williams. He points to Airbus’s early days when it was setting out to challenge not just Boeing, but McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed too. “There was a lot of assumption that American technology had to be the best. That [transformation] is something everybody was proud of.”

In tandem with its market-share growth, Airbus also reinvented itself as a fully integrated business free from the shackles of governments’ national agendas.

“Louis started it and Tom carried it on – to make the company truly international,” recalls Williams, referring to then Airbus chief executives Louis Gallois and Tom Enders.

“If you go back to the time of the ‘GIE’ [Airbus Industrie consortium], you had to slice and dice your teams by passports. Tom cut through all that and said we’re going to put people in position who are the best and most knowledgeable. And that created some internal turmoil but was all part of getting the company in the right direction.”

Williams says building a product line to rival Boeing has been a key Airbus achievement

Airbus

Williams reflects on how, with the benefit of hindsight, the decision in 2000 to launch the A380 now looks questionable, but points out it must be considered in context. “At the time the world looked a different place,” he says. “The A380 seemed to be the next logical step [for Airbus].”

What is not in doubt is the huge strain that the A380’s production meltdown put on Airbus and its management team, particularly when combined with the turbulence that the A400M military transport introduced.

Williams likens the “all-consuming” A380 programme to “a huge machine that was chewing up money and people and resource”.

“And the A400M came along at the worst possible time. The programme added a huge amount of complexity and sucked away resource and talent, which was a big issue.

“There was a bit of hubris that the company entered into a fixed-price contract [for A400M] with technology that was at the best unproven…with so many different functionalities required for each different nation.”

Williams says that the A400M “consumed an awful lot of energy…it was probably underrated in terms of the impact that had on the company. It drove a huge amount of management attention.”

One achievement Williams is extremely proud of is the way Airbus and its supply chain have navigated the unprecedented rise in output. In 2000, when he joined Airbus, its single-aisle deliveries hit an annual record of 241 aircraft. Last year, Airbus shipped 626 A320-family aircraft.

But he admits to being cynical about rate rises in the early days, recalling a meeting with the Airbus team back in 1997 when he was at BAE Systems for discussions about an increase in single-aisle production from 12 per month to 20. “We were rolling about on the floor laughing,” he says.

“And by the time I was head of programmes in 2006, we were at the point of saying we want to go from rate 28 to rate 30 and 35. I can remember conversations with people who were saying ‘it’s madness, Tom, building one aeroplane every day, it’s impossible’.”

Williams says that the difficulty in predicting long-term output requirements results in a less-than-ideal production line set-ups.

A380 was “next logical step” but put huge strain on Airbus’s production infrastructure

Airbus

“We could have done it better if we had known the end game at the beginning,” he says. “But if you’d said to the people at that time ‘we will actually need rate 70’, then they’d be sending for the men in the white coats.

“And because of that, every decision was incremental: ‘how quickly can you get to rate 32, 36 etc? And we’re not sure how long it’s going to last so what’s the minimum capex you can spend?’

“So all these incremental steps don’t lead you to what you’d consider to be lean flow and best in class.”

Williams credits Enders as the architect of Airbus’s drive to expand its international footprint. “He was pushing very hard on the internationalisation of the company. The deal we signed to build the FAL [final assembly line] in Tianjin was transformational. Before that, we were bouncing around in the 20-30% market share and we quickly went to 50%.”

Williams also now sees the benefit of Airbus’s US FAL in Mobile, despite earlier doubts.

“I argued against it at the time, I wasn’t sure what the point of it was. But Tom jokes with me that when you look at the guy in the White House now, the FAL in Mobile looks like an inspired decision.”

Another “inspired” move Williams was part of was the launch in 2010 of a re-engined A320 rather than holding off for an all-new single-aisle project.

“Our internal modelling of an all-new aeroplane showed it was only going to bring another 3% of performance improvement over the [re-engined] A320neo’s 15%, “says Williams. “And the unit costs looked horrendous because trying to build in high volume in carbonfibre is not easy and not cheap.

“It was an argument that said the all-new single-aisle really needs to wait until the next step of engine technology, like contra-rotating open-rotors, and that’s not going to come until the latter part of the next decade. So we should get on and do this re-engining.”

The A320neo’s main mission was to stop the Bombardier CSeries in its tracks, says Williams. What ultimately resulted was the CSeries becoming a key member of the Airbus product line-up as the A220, while A320neo sales have gone on to exceed 6,500 aircraft.

Williams says he has handed over to his successor, Michael Schöllhorn, with the simple advice to “enjoy every day because it’s the best job in the world, working with the best technology and fantastic people passionate about the industry. And the time will zip past!”

Airbus A380 - Global Security,"Fri, 03 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHNlY3VyaXR5Lm9yZy9taWxpdGFyeS93b3JsZC9ldXJvcGUvYTM4MC5odG3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus A380

The Airbus A3XX-100 was an entirely new aircraft that was scheduled [as of 1997] to be introduced into service by 2003. The A3XX-100, unlike other currently planned aircraft, would feature a double-deck design capable of holding 555 passengers and 187,000 pounds of cargo when full. The aircraft would be 232 feet long, 79 feet tall, and have a 259-foot wingspan. MTOW would be approximately 1.1 million pounds, supported by a four-strut, 24-wheel main landing gear. A final decision on the aircraft design was expected to occur sometime toward the end of 1998. It was anticipated that the aircraft's basic shape and size would not change, but changes in its operational characteristics may occur. Engine selection, wing design, and other modifications may result in operating weight changes but should not affect the general size of the aircraft.

The Airbus A3XX-200 is a stretched derivative of the A3XX-100 that was being considered for production after the 100 is introduced. The aircraft would be identical to the 100, except for the addition of a 22-foot fuselage section. This stretch would accommodate an additional 101 passengers, bringing the total passenger capacity up to 656. The MTOW for the 200 would be 1.21 million pounds. As of 1997 the Airbus A3XX-200 was the largest NLA that is being considered for development.

Taking a clean-sheet design for airlines' operational needs of tomorrow, Airbus developed the A380 as the most spacious and efficient airliner ever conceived. This 525-seat aircraft would deliver an unparalleled level of comfort while retaining all the benefits of commonality with Airbus' other fly-by-wire aircraft Families. With two full-length decks offering 50% more floor surface than any other high capacity aircraft. Broader seats. More personal storage. Better head room. Wider stairs. All in all, more space for every passenger to relax and appreciate the quietest cabin of any airliner currently flying. The wide open spaces outside the A380 benefit from its design, too. The A380's engine emissions are well below current international limits, contributing to improved air quality around the airports it serves.

Its twin, full-length, wide-bodied cabin has exceptionally efficient air filters. With four high level air outlets instead of the traditional two, the cabin air gets refreshed every three minutes. Which helps passengers to feel fresher, both during and after the flight. There is a fresh approach to its environmental impact, too. With a new wing design and composite materials accounting for 25% of its structural weight, the A380 is a much more efficient aircraft all round. And by producing only about 75g of CO2 per passenger kilometer, the A380 is contributing to the aviation industry's commitment to constraining greenhouse gas emissions.

Two full-length decks with more space for every passenger. 220 windows flooding the cabin with natural light. An onboard noise level that's the lowest of any existing passenger aircraft, quiet enough to significantly reduce fatigue.

But the environmental benefits of the A380 don't just belong to the passengers. The stringent ISO14001 corporate certification awarded to Airbus recognizes our use of a robust Environmental Management System to minimize the environmental impact of the A380, throughout its life cycle.

The Airbus A380 goes to great lengths to make long-haul flying feel more natural. There's the extra space per passenger afforded by its twin, full-length, wide-bodied cabins. The cabin air, recycled every three minutes to keep the atmosphere fresh. The natural light provided by 220 cabin windows. And while the A380 feels more natural inside, the environment outside benefits too. From the dramatically reduced external noise levels. From the lower fuel consumption and significantly improved CO2 emissions per passenger kilometre. From the increased capacity at airports and the reduced need for expansion.

In November 2007 Andrea Rothman and Laurence Frost of Bloomberg reported that Airbus SAS planned to build a 900- seat version of its A380 superjumbo. Emirates, the aircraft's biggest customer, had said it would buy the new model. Airbus would begin developing an A380 ``stretch'' after the standard plane reaches full production in 2010, Chief Operating Officer John Leahy said in an interview. The biggest Arab airline would fit out the plane to carry 750 passengers on a typical flight, Clark said. Routes to countries such as Thailand and Saudi Arabia, destination of the Muslim Hajj pilgrimage, would even support a 1,000-seater plane, though airports might struggle to cope. The stretched superjumbo, to be designated the A380-900, would be developed once the current edition reaches its maximum build rate of 40 planes a year in 2010, Leahy said. The new jetliner would enter the market around 2015, he said.

Airbus projected a market of 1,250 aircraft A380-sized planes over the twenty years to 2030. Boeing expected a market for just 325 such planes. Airbus' break-even for the A380 is 420 planes, 160% of Boeing's market projections. If Boeing was off by 50% on the high side, the market for super jumbos is 488 planes, of which Airbus must sell 86% just to break even. Equally, if Airbus was off 50% on the low side, the super jumbo market is 625 planes, of which Airbus must sell 67% to break even. On top of this, Airbus expected to sell 751 A380s, or 154% of Boeing's 50% upside calculation, and 120% of its own 50% downside calculation.

Boeing cited the current trend in airline customers ""focused on point-to-point travel"" -- flying non-stop, direct, from origin to destination -- rather than the hub-to-hub travel for which the A380 is designed. Hub-to-hub requires most passengers to board small-airliner regional/""feeder"" flights to reach the first hub airport (where large groups of passengers gather to board the A380) then change planes to the A380 and ride it to another hub airport, then again board a connecting small-airliner flight to reach their ultimate destination.

The Boeing Sonic Cruiser proposal was aimed at Airbus, specifically the new 550-seat A380. If Boeing could produce a 300-seat Mach 0.95-0.98 machine with greater than 6,000-n.mi. range and only slightly higher costs, it could transform the economics of airline operations. The first-class, business-class, and high-end economy-class passengers would be drawn into the new machines, leaving behind the low-yield passenger categories for the Airbus A380. Sonic Cruiser's timing was suspicious to some, who wondered whether Sonic Cruiser was an unripe concept, intended primarily to create doubts about the A380's future. The proposal may also have helped to prevent Japan from joining the A380 as an industrial partner.

With three cancellations and not a single order in the first ten months of 2013, Airbus announced 08 November 2013 a disappointing outlook for the once-feted A380. Sales of the world's biggest commercial aircraft suffered in 2012 after hairline cracks were discovered on the wings of the A380. Only nine planes were sold in 2012, down from an initial order of 30. On 17 November 2013 Dubai-based Emirates airline placed an additional order for 50 A380 aircraft, confirming the continued strong demand for very large aircraft in the Middle East that are needed to meet the regions higher than average traffic growth. The order was signed at a ceremony at the 2013 Dubai Airshow.

Four customers were scheduled to receive their initial jetliners in 2014  representing the most ever in a calendar year since A380 deliveries began in 2007, while also bringing the operator count up to 14. On 26 May 2014 South Koreas Asiana Airlines took delivery of its first Airbus A380, becoming the eleventh operator of the type in the world. Asiana Airlines had ordered six A380s, powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines. Airbus currently had 324 firm orders for the A380, from 20 customers.

According to Airbus September 2013 Global Market Forecast (GMF), in the next 20 years (2013-2032), ""In the Very Large aircraft market, dominated by the A380, there is a requirement for 1,334 passenger aircraft valued at US$519 billion. Of these, 47 per cent would be needed in the Asia-Pacific region, followed by the Middle East (26 per cent) and then Europe (16 per cent). Asia-Pacifics requirement for the A380 is demonstrated by the regions growth in middle classes which is set to quadruple in Asia-Pacific in 20 years.""

The A350-1000s new engine  the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 successfully made its first flight-test 05 November 2015 aboard Airbus dedicated A380 Flying-Test-Bed aircraft. The aircraft took off from Airbus facilities in Toulouse and performed a fl ight of 4 hours, 14 mins during which the engine covered a wide range of power settings at altitudes up to 35,000ft. The engines operation and handling qualities were evaluated from low speeds to Mach 0.87.

The Trent XWB-97 development engine was mounted on the A380s inner left engine pylon, replacing one of the aircrafts Trent 900 engines. The crew on board this first flight were: Airbus Experimental test pilots Etienne de Malleray and Hugues Van der Stichel; Experimental Test Flight Engineer Gerard Maisonneuve and Flight Test Engineers Emmanuele Costanzo and Jean-Philippe Cottet.

Commencing around nine months prior to the A350-1000s first flight, this engine flight-test program included hot weather as well as icing condition testing campaigns. The specially enhanced Trent XWB engine produces 97,000lbs of thrust on take-off  making it the most powerful engine ever developed for an Airbus aircraft.

Singapore Airlines opted in September 2016 not to extend the lease for its first Airbus A380 after only 10 years of flying - the airline does not want to expand its A380 fleet beyond the 19 aircraft it operated and the five more on firm order.

Air France was not taking the final two A380s it had on order.

Lufthansa reduced its commitment by one aircraft.

Qantas Airways did not want to take the eight in the backlog.

Virgin Atlantic did not want the six it bought a decade and a half earlier.

Australian airline Qantas Airways on 07 February 2019 announced it had formally canceled an order for eight Airbus A380 superjumbo jets. The Qantas announcement came following doubts over the future of the world's largest passenger airliner, as A380 orders continue to decline and stall. In January 2019, Airbus removed orders for 10 of the European superjumbo jets, reportedly linked to Hong Kong Airlines. Emirates airline has ordered 56 A380s, but is reportedly considering switching some or all of them for smaller fuel-efficient aircraft such as the A350 or A330. The cost of each aircraft is said to be about 385 million ($435 million).

As a consequence and given the lack of order backlog with other airlines, Airbus would cease deliveries of the A380 in 2021. European aerospace multinational Airbus said on 14 February 2019 that it would stop manufacturing the double-decker A380 aircraft, the superjumbo popular with travellers but too costly for many airlines. Due to the lack of airline demand we have to wind down production of the A380, Airbus said in its full year results for 2018. Airbus said Dubai-based airline Emirates had reduced its order of A380 by 39 planes, leaving just 14 superjumbos in the order book left to be delivered. As a consequence of this decision and given the lack of order backlog with other airlines, deliveries of the A380 will cease in 2021, said Airbus. The company, which has its headquarters in Toulouse, had been forced to slow down its production of the A380 in recent years and warned in January 2018 that the model could be scrapped if new orders were not forthcoming.

The decision was a boon for rival Boeing and a crushing blow for Airbus. The European plane maker had hoped the A380 would squeeze out Boeings 747 and revolutionise air travel as more people take to the skies. Instead, airlines had been cautious about committing to the costly plane, so huge that airports had to build new runways and modify terminals to accommodate it.

The last order from Emirates would have brought the build total to nearly 350 and kept the A380 production line open until at least 2028. Total production was 274 aircraft. Another 140 or so aircraft were on order at one time, with subsequent cancellation of the orders. The 747 made aviation history when it entered service with Pan Am in 1970. Production looks set to continue at least until 2022. The Boeing 777's 1,547 deliveries take it ahead of the 747's 1,544 as the world's leading widebody aircraft.

The A380 ""was never a good idea"", according to Richard Aboulafia, vice president of the Teal Group consultancy. ""In fact, it was a very bad idea, one of the worst self-inflicted wounds in aerospace history. The market wants range and efficiency; capacity for capacity's sake is not wanted at all,"" he said. The A380's four jets are a disadvantage, he said, as twin jets ""can do most of the job in terms of range and seat count... Airbus made its problem worse by designing an aircraft that's extremely heavy, even for its seat count.""

This new order, from an experienced U.K. helicopter operator that will use it for general corporate purposes, takes the ACH160 order book to 11 aircraft — of which four have been won in the U.K.

Two other ACH160s have been ordered by a privately-owned U.K. company which is also a long-time corporate helicopter user, and a fourth U.K. aircraft has been ordered by an existing private Airbus Helicopters VIP customer to be managed by Isle of Man-based Luviair.

The H160 medium helicopter program remains on track for certification at the end of 2019 to be followed by the first ACH deliveries about one year later.

After recording 54 sales in 2017 following its launch at EBACE in May that year, ACH recorded 68 orders in 2018.

Mirroring sister brand Airbus Corporate Jets (ACJ), ACH provides an exclusive end-to-end ownership experience from first enquiry and ordering, through in-service support, to enhanced resale opportunities.

ACH delivers the highest standards in safety, technology, craftsmanship and service and is backed by HCareFirst – a premium support service aimed directly at the specific needs of operators typically recording low flight-hours but demanding worry-free aircraft availability when required.

Frederic Lemos, head of ACH, said: “This substantial new business for the ACH160 even before certification is clearly demonstrating its very high level of acceptance in the market. These firm orders from highly knowledgeable customers are concrete evidence that the aircraft is addressing the needs of the most demanding operators.”

The full ACH helicopter range consists of the ACH125, ACH130, ACH135, new ACH145, ACH160 and ACH175 variants of Airbus Helicopters’ comprehensive and market-leading family of light and medium models. A range of premium-design aircraft completions, including bespoke solutions, is available for all models.

Renowned for its combination of versatility and comfort, the ACH range of helicopters is admired by passengers and pilots alike for its stylish interiors, smooth and quiet ride allied to its technologically advanced Helionix digital avionics system ensuring carefree handling and the highest level of safety.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9965003728866577}",neutral,0.9965003728866577,0

Innovation Days are the global press-briefings that Airbus holds before the Paris Airshow. This year is also special, because it is Airbus’s 50th year being completed next week.

Many issues will be discussed, and I’ll try and keep up to speed. But here is the first one, which is very interesting. The Airbus 220, which is a plane I’ve watched very keenly since it turned over from being Bombardier C Series to the Airbus 220 last July.

Airbus, today announced, that the A220 Family aircraft, the newest single-aisle aircraft, which focusses on the 100-150 seater market, will be offering increased range starting from the second half of 2020, on the back of increased take-off weight of the aircraft.

The A220’s maximum take-off weight is going to increase by 2,268 kg (2.3 metric tonnes). The new MTOW will increase the respective maximum range capabilities to 3,350nm for the A220-300 and 3,400nm for the A220-100, approximately 450nm more than currently advertised.

This performance increase is achieved by taking credit of existing structural and systems margins as well as existing fuel volume capacity. This will allow airlines to tap into new routes that were not possible before, connecting key cities in Western Europe with the Middle East or from Southeast Asia to Australia. From an Indian perspective too the range bump looks very impressive.

Airbus has 530 of these aircraft on order, and just earlier this week, they delivered their 12,000th aircraft, which was an Airbus 220 built in Canada for Delta.

There are interesting use cases for the small aircraft in India as well, such as the Airbus 220, but will any airline buy them or just position the bigger single aisles is yet to be seen!","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9636751413345337}",neutral,0.9636751413345337,0
Inside Airbus' Production Facility at Hamburg Finkenwerder Airport - AirlineGeeks.com,"Thu, 02 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZWdlZWtzLmNvbS8yMDE5LzA1LzAyL2luc2lkZS1haXJidXMtaGFtYnVyZy1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLWZhY2lsaXR5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"[ Airports ] By AirlineGeeks.com Staff

Truly a European aircraft manufacturer, Airbus has facilities in multiple countries across the European continent in addition to its main facility in Toulouse, France. One of those facilities is at Finkenwerder Airport, a private airfield near Hamburg, Germany, which assists in the production of Airbus aircraft.

The airport is used exclusively by Airbus and features multiple ramp areas that seemingly extend into the adjacent Elbe where countless Airbus aircraft of all sizes can be seen. Airbus even has its own control tower at the airport staffed by air traffic controllers.

The airport’s main operations consist of aircraft movement directly related to Airbus’s manufacturing process. A day in the life of the airport consists of seeing flight testing of aircraft in production, acceptance flights for aircraft pending delivery to airlines, employee shuttles and cargo flights of the Airbus A300-600ST Belugas.

The Beluga is a modified A300 designated as a Super Transporter. Several times a day, Airbus’s fleet of Belugas transport oversized cargo in the form of major aircraft components to and from other Airbus factories in Europe. Other large parts such as vertical stabilizers can also be seen from here arriving by truck.

Spotters from all over the world come to see the Belugas as well as to catch a glimpse of aircraft in various stages of production destined for airlines throughout the world. In a few short hours at the spotting platform, one can see brand new Airbus single-aisle aircraft in the liveries of airlines from Asia, Europe, North America and Africa before they are delivered.

For spotters, aviation enthusiasts as well as aviation media, this location provides an opportunity to catch the newest plane for a particular airline, a new livery for an airline or even a special livery that has yet to been seen by the public. For that reason, the spotting platform is always filled with people waiting to be the first to catch a certain aircraft.

Just outside the facility, Airbus pays tribute to its history by displaying several historical Airbus aircraft on display. The most notable aircraft on display was the enormous Super Guppy transport which was the propeller-driven predecessor to the Beluga. Other aircraft on display there included the HFB 320 Hansa Jet that was built in Hamburg from 1964-1973.

Airbus operates two Airbus A320 family production facilities in Hamburg, producing aircraft from the A318 to the A321neo LR. Each aircraft enters the assembly line as a small shell of a fuselage and moves through the five different stages of production before exiting the hangar as an assembled Airbus. This particular line can produce a new Airbus A318 “baby bus” every two days. The aircraft that was almost complete in the fifth stage of assembly was destined for Canada’s Air Transat, its first A321neo.

In addition to its single-aisle aircraft, Airbus also has production facilities for its widebody A350 XWB and A330 family aircraft. It is quite easy to spot an Airbus A330neo in this facility as the next-generation aircraft is a predominantly aluminum aircraft which sports the greenish zinc chromate color as opposed to the tan color of the A350’s composite shell.

Here, one can see different sections of fuselage being fitted with components before being matched together to form a single aircraft body. At least 17 sections of widebody fuselage were being assembled in this part of the factory.

As with any airport, the control tower, located above the Airbus Delivery Centre, provides arguably the best view of the runway. Airbus aircraft on a variety of missions are taking off and arriving constantly with the Elbe River as a natural backdrop. A spotter and enthusiast’s delight, the Beluga can be seen here countless times during the day.

The control tower not only provides an unobstructed view of the runway but nearly the entirety of the Airbus facility. Looking down at all the foreign tails from airlines around the world, one would think they are at a busy international airport instead of a single-runway private airport outside of Hamburg.

Among those on display was the second iteration of ANA’s Airbus A380, the FLYING HONU, in its Emerald Green paint. AirlineGeeks recently toured the airline’s first A380, Lani, in Tokyo and saw how the airline specially configured the aircraft for Hawaii service.

While many in the traveling public do not think much about the aircraft they are flying on, there is a good chance that their aircraft started its life here in Hamburg where Airbus is constantly producing more and more aircraft every day.

Airbus and Spanish Air Force to develop drone and augmented reality inspections for military aircraft - EDR Magazine,"Thu, 30 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lZHJtYWdhemluZS5ldS9haXJidXMtYW5kLXNwYW5pc2gtYWlyLWZvcmNlLXRvLWRldmVsb3AtZHJvbmUtYW5kLWF1Z21lbnRlZC1yZWFsaXR5LWluc3BlY3Rpb25zLWZvci1taWxpdGFyeS1haXJjcmFmdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Madrid, 29 May 2019 – The Spanish Air Force has become the first air force worldwide to support the development of Airbus’ drone and augmented reality-based maintenance inspection services, with the aim of drastically reducing maintenance inspections for large military aircraft and increasing overall fleet availability.

This digital innovation technology will initially be trialled on Spanish Air Force A400M aircraft based at Zaragoza Air Base (31st Wing), with options to extend the technology to other aircraft, including the C295 and the CN235.

General José Luis Pardo Jario, Head of the Spanish Chief of the Air Staff office, said: “This technology has the potential to make a major contribution to maintenance tasks for our fleet.

Not only is it more time and cost efficient, above all it allows the upskilling of aircraft maintenance personnel, in accordance with the new digital era we all need to contribute towards in order to reap its benefits.”

The technology relies on drones equipped with sensors and high-definition cameras to scan, in a matter of hours and not days, the exterior of an aircraft undergoing a maintenance inspection. A secured connection allows data and information generated to be displayed on tablets and augmented reality glasses, allowing staff to quickly identify and apply maintenance procedures and corrective actions while ensuring all inspection and maintenance procedures are formally and fully recorded on the maintenance log. Not only does this technology reduce the maintenance inspection time, it supports the early detection of defects and helps guarantee quality and post-maintenance airworthiness.

José Antonio Urbano Torres, Military Aircraft R&D Chief Engineer, said: “Innovation and technological development are part of our DNA. Airbus invests considerable human and economic resources in the research and development of new processes, products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We would like to thank the Spanish Air Force for its contribution and commitment to the development and maturity of this system, which is sure to revolutionise military aircraft maintenance.”

The tests with the Spanish Air Force A400M will allow Airbus to use real user data, not only to consolidate the algorithms for safe autonomous flight of the drone around an aircraft thus avoiding the use of scaffolding and heavy mobile equipment that risks damaging the aircraft, but also to process the terabytes of images and data as a deep learning library that allows for the development of a robust Artificial Intelligence-based defects detection system.

Through its SmartForce portfolio, Airbus is continuously developing new technologies and innovative services to help military customers assess, predict and anticipate the needs of their fleets by leveraging big data analytics coupled to secured connectivity to ensure the highest mission readiness.

Airbus pledges counter-punch to new Boeing mid-sized jet - CNBC,"Tue, 21 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTkvMDUvMjEvYWlyYnVzLXBsZWRnZXMtY291bnRlci1wdW5jaC10by1uZXctYm9laW5nLW1pZC1zaXplZC1qZXQuaHRtbNIBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDE5LzA1LzIxL2FpcmJ1cy1wbGVkZ2VzLWNvdW50ZXItcHVuY2gtdG8tbmV3LWJvZWluZy1taWQtc2l6ZWQtamV0Lmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus BelugaXL super transporter aircraft arrives for the first time at the company's wing assembly plant at Broughton, near Chester, Britain February 14, 2019.

Airbus hinted on Tuesday at a price battle to counter a possible new Boeing aircraft in the middle of the jet market, promising a ""left hook, right hook"" salvo from two of its well-established models.

U.S. planemaker Boeing is studying whether to launch a 220-270-seat jet wedged between traditional twin-aisle models like the Airbus A330 or its own 787, and the industry's bread-and-butter single-aisle models like the A320/321 and Boeing 737.

Airbus aims to defend that space with its own A330neo at the top end and the best-selling A321neo at the bottom - two models boasting new engines on older airframes.

""Those programs are both so mature that it gives Airbus pricing flexibility to address this middle-of-the-market segment,"" sales chief Christian Scherer said.

He promised what he described as a ""left-hook, right-hook approach"" to that part of the market, using the two Airbus jets, as airlines replace Boeing 757 and some larger 767 aircraft.

Boeing says its possible mid-market aircraft would be significantly more efficient than either Airbus model, but it is under pressure from airlines to develop it at the right price.

Boeing continues to promote the project behind the scenes while toning down public discussions as it focuses on resolving the crisis over its grounded 737 MAX, airline sources say.

The two giants are playing reverse roles at the top end of the $150 billion annual jet market, where Boeing's upcoming 406-seat 777X - a derivative of its 777 mini-jumbo with new engines - is up against the newer and slightly smaller A350-1000.

Scherer mocked the 777X as a ""re-engined Hummer"" hobbled by excess weight compared with the carbon A350. Boeing, which recently won a deal to sell the 777X to British Airways after a gap in sales, maintains it is the most efficient plane per seat.

Boeing has outsold the A350-1000 almost two to one with its 777X, but its order book is heavily dependent on Gulf carriers whose expansion plans look increasingly fragile, analysts say.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9899417757987976}",neutral,0.9899417757987976,0
